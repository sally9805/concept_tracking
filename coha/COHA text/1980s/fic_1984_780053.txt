 | a tender look on his face  --  the recollection vanished . She was standing on the lawn with Fanny , Blaise , and Eugene staring at her , Eugene had followed from the house . " Take it away , Blaise , " he commanded . " Right away , right away . " Blaise turned to Miriam . " Is there any special place you 'd like for me . . . " And on the dark face there was a look of extraordinary gentleness . " Come , now , " Eugene said , " it 's too bad , and I 'm sorry , but let 's not go into mourning . Spare me , please . I 'll get another dog for you , and that will be that . " As if a dog were a thing ! " Do n't look so glum , " he admonished . " You have other things to think about now anyway . " Her hands went to her stomach , its swelling bulge hidden under the circling skirts . Fanny had told her how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her thoughts went then from life to death , to violent death , as if the dog 's death were an omen . Lately she had been thinking of her mother and of her own birth ; she could then feel , actually feel , a thrust of pain , even while she knew these thoughts were morbid and unreasonable . But fear went with her , nevertheless . A looming ghost , it came with darkness . Early in the night , as if on signal , the trill and throb of insects gave sudden way to a foreboding silence . After a while the wind rose , flying and soughing through the Scotch pines on the bayou path where the wet black alligator with the hideous snake-head would be slithering after prey . An owl screeched . The owl 's screech is a death sign , Fanny used to say . The house stood abandoned to the night . Who would tell what lurked beyond the bolted doors ? Every night , after everyone was asleep , Eugene bolted the heavy doors . Often Miriam thought about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the plantation troubled her . She had looked into the quarters where , on the littered floors , children crawled among fowl and their droppings , while dogs and sheltering hogs rooted under the shacks . She had seen the families taking their evening meal on their doorsteps , eating out of a common iron pot with their fingers or a piece of wood . Friendly voices greeted , " Evening , missis . " They were friendlier than the overseer , a sullen Yankee who lived with his family at the far end of the line of shacks . Strange that he never smiled , while those whom he ruled from his tall post on horseback could smile .  | " He steals from the master , " Fanny told Miriam . " Everybody knows he does . " He got a bonus for every bale of cotton over the fixed quota , and he worked the people hard . Everyone over the age of ten labored from the rising of the sun to its setting . Even children , before they were old enough to cut cane or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four hundred pounds a day , worked carrying water to the fields . So Eugene kept a gun and pistols in the cupboard next to the bed . Eugene , she could have told him while she lay awake , listening to every creak and whisper , Eugene , neither the doors nor the guns will help if they want to get in . She could almost hear the snapping flames whir as they rushed up the chimney and devoured the stairs . But there were worse fears . The rounded bulk of Eugene 's back made a deeper darkness in the dark space of the bed . Her eyes , stretched wide , fixed themselves on the man 's sleeping back . A whole life . A whole life , like this . He was not satisfied with her . And why should he be ? She could not love him . He wanted what she could not give . He wanted a wife to please him in return for his name and his support ; that was only what any man would want . A woman was supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not . That , too , was part of the unspoken bargain . But I ca n't do it , she thought ; something in me ca n't do it . And she felt pity for him because he gave fairly to the bond called marriage while she did not . They were strangers to each other , although he would never undermine his dignity by admitting that he knew they were , or that she loathed him . Only in company did his laughter ring . All the long summer , by carriage and steamer , the guests came and went , whole families of them , to stay for a day , a week , or longer . Early in the morning before they clattered away on horseback to the hunt , the men breakfasted downstairs . Still in bed , for pregnancy gave her an excuse to avoid whatever she wanted to avoid , Miriam could hear them talking over their potted meats , their salmon and prawns , their claret and sugared brandy . In the evening after dinner she could excuse herself again and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she was not delicate ; her body tingled with energy . Her feet moved to the sound of violins , to the mazurkas and quadrilles being danced below . It was only the spirit , weighted down , that did not move . Her mind drifted . To walk downstairs and out of the door ! To throw  | off all these cumbersome skirts , to stride away like some countrywoman in her shift , her cotton or linsey-woolsey with a hole for the head , her cool garments so poor and still so graceful ! Yes , dressed like that , to walk and walk through the fields , past the sweet gum groves , up the hill , free , free  --  Her hand made an arc in the air , a falling gesture of resignation . Romantic nonsense ! Free , free , and over the hill to where ? Late , after she had fallen asleep , Eugene would come upstairs . She would awake to the rustle of his clothes and the creak of the bed when he climbed in ; then he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought , someday it will happen . Something inside me that I am holding back will give way , and I shall pummel his back with my fists and scream . Yet he meant her no harm . He had sought her out and wanted her . She was to mother his child . Would the child make a change ? In him ? Or in herself ? She wanted to ask Pelagie , now pregnant with her sixth child , whether that was so . When Pelagie came to visit she would ask . " I 'm very unhappy , Pelagie , " she said . The blood flowed up Pelagie 's white neck and tinged her earlobes . " I hate it , " Miriam whispered . " I dread it . " And she wanted to ask , Is there something wrong with me ? Is there any way I can make it better ? But Pelagie 's hideous blush prevented her . " If one wants children , it 's the only way , " Pelagie said . She had not once looked at Miriam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wispy hair had not yet been done that morning . Her hair had gone dead . Her brightness had flowed away , gone into the children . Thick and swollen , how changed she was from that girl with the sweet round face ! All those children ! All those months of vomiting , for Pelagie was sick each time . Now , feeling Miriam 's gaze , Pelagie looked up . The same sweet smile came to her face . Uncomprehending and sweet . " He 's a generous husband , Miriam . You must think of that . Your lovely house and this place . Think of all the good things . I 'm sure you 'll learn to be happy , dear . It 's within yourself , you know . " So not even with Pelagie could she open her heart and mind . One rainy morning when Fanny brought breakfast , Miriam saw that she had been crying . Fanny 's emotions had always reflected Miriam 's  | joys or griefs , never her own . This startling realization flashed through Miriam 's head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's Blaise . The master wants to send him away . " " I do n't believe it ! " " It 's so . Master says there 's no work for Blaise , not enough for him to do . Blaise has been crying . We 've been together since we were born , Miss Miriam . " Fanny swept her apron up to hide her face . " Where does he want to send him ? " " To some friend of his . I do n't remember the name . " Fanny 's voice was muffled under the apron . " Somebody moving to Texas , he said . I do n't know where Texas is , but they say it 's far . " Miriam got out of bed . " Bring me a dress , Fanny . Hurry and do my hair fast . Where is Mr. Mendes ? " " In the library he was . " Miriam trembled . She had no idea how she would do it , but she was certain on the instant of one thing : This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading letters at his desk . He looked up , annoyed at the interruption . Miriam was still trembling . Nevertheless , she demanded , " What are you doing to Blaise ? " " Doing ? Oh , my God , has that Fanny of yours gone crying to you ? Do n't tell me . I 've been wrestling with his tears all morning . " " They have a right to their tears . Do you know what their life has been ? What it was until they came to my father 's house ? Their father was ? " " Do n't bother to tell me , please . I 've heard these stories a hundred times . Misery , misery . I 'm not responsible for their past miseries . " " You could help make up for them , though , " she replied , surprising herself with the sharpness of her tone . The black eyebrows slithered upward . To her further surprise , Eugene defended himself . " What do you want of me ? I treat my people well . You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not ? " " True , but- " " But nothing . I 'm not running a charity . If I have no use for a person , I have to use . And I 'm not going to keep him on , feeding and clothing him , when he 's not earning his keep . " " Surely you could find something for Blaise to do . Surely the food he  | eats is n't going to make us poor . " The pain in Fanny 's eyes drove her on ; she felt Fanny 's cause as though it were her own . " You know they all exaggerate , do n't you ? When they do n't lie , they exaggerate . They 're all hysterical . Blaise will have a good home where he 's going and Fanny will get over it . They wo n't die of the separation . They wo n't be the first brother and sister to be separated . Are n't you separated from your brother ? " " That 's different , Mr. Mendes , and you know it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If he were here , David would understand . " She had almost forgotten how , long ago , her brother had been fired by what had seemed an exaggerated anger . Now she remembered that fire . " David would not do this to them , " she said . Eugene stood up . " Ah , so it 's your brother , is it ? You 're turning out like him , are you ? " " What do you know about my brother ? You 've never even met him . " " No , but I 've heard plenty , " Eugene said grimly . " He and his loosetongued kind do n't know what they 're talking about . Do you want blood to flow here ? Do you want to see the house burned to the ground ? " " I do n't understand you . All I asked is that you do n't send Blaise away . That 's all I ask . Is it so hard to do one simple kindness ? " " One so-called simple kindness after the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feed my people ? " " Cornmeal , salt pork , and molasses . " " What should they eat , then ? They eat what country people eat . Go see what a white farmer puts on his table ! The poor are poor everywhere . Can we feed them all from our table ? " That was true : The poor were the poor , as they had been in the Europe that she still remembered . Here , though , the poor whites came to the door , not begging , but demanding . Under their poke bonnets the women 's eyes were scornful and Eugene always gave . " You know I do what I can , " he said . Sometimes when the farmers " got in the grass , " when the weeds threatened to choke out the cotton plants , he sent them help to do their weeding and save the crop . " You know I do what I can , " he repeated , and she saw that he was agitated , that in some way she had reached him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants ? No , I  | suppose you do n't . Well , I 'll tell you so you wo n't think I 'm such a monster . Have you never heard of the iron collar ? The head enclosed between three iron prongs so that the neck ca n't turn ? Do you know that runaways have been tied naked to a tree and lashed ? Or ? " " That 's enough ! Please . " " Well , then ! I treat honorably , I trade honorably , and I do n't need interference in my affairs . " She had caught a word . " You trade ? " " It 's not my main business , certainly not . But once in a while if a gang should be sent down from Virginia , for instance , and I can make a quick turnover , I do . I 've never dealt with smugglers or anything outside the law , and I can swear to that , which is more than some of your most respected families like your Aunt Emma 's people can do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " I am a southerner , of the South . My people have been in this country for two centuries . We old Spanish families helped to build it . Go to Charleston , to Savannah , and you 'll see . " He drew himself straight . " I should n't have allowed this discussion to go so far , and you should know a woman 's place . " A woman 's place ! Once , perhaps more than once , during the courtship , he had admired her spirit , as on that fateful afternoon when , with Emma , she had been conducted through his house . Now all he expected of her was submission . Anger met shame and burned like fire in her throat . Then she thought of Fanny 's sorrowful eyes . She thought of Blaise , a young man weeping , standing here before the authority of this other man , and weeping . And suddenly she knew what she had to do . She got down on her knees . When her voice came it was so faint that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I beg of you . Do n't send Blaise away . He could . . " She swallowed . " My time is almost here . If we have a boy you could give Blaise to him . He 's a gentleman . He would be a good servant to bring up a boy . " " Get up , Mrs. Mendes , will you , for heaven 's sake ? Do n't be dramatic . " Eugene held his hand out to raise her , but she grasped the arm of the chair instead and pulled herself up . He walked to the desk , turned over a paper , and coughed while she stood waiting . " Well , to tell you the truth , I had not thought of that . You may be right . He would be ideal for a boy . "  | " You 'll keep him , then ? You 'll tell them that ? " " I 'll keep him only until we know about the child . If we have a son , then , yes , he may stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " So if it 's a daughter , she thought , as she went upstairs , I shall simply have to think of something else . For the time being she had won . Oh , she thought , I wish I did not know I would have to live out my life in this country , where things like this happen every day and the government allows them . She was very , very tired , with a weariness and a confusion in the depths of her soul . Best not to think about anything more just now . Best just to close her mind and drift through the days . Autumn , the season of russet leaves and the turkey hunt , approached . This year there was no cooling of the air ; instead , the heat mounted , and in the city the Asiatic choleras appeared , adding to the annual horror of yellow fever . All who could and who had not already fled the city , did so now . But for some it was too late . Eugene brought in a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Rosa de Rivera  --  bad news . Henry 's dead of the fever . They ought to have stayed longer in Saratoga . Very poor judgment . " A chill shook Miriam . This was her first experience with death . No one she knew had ever just disappeared , just vanished . Who would sit in Henry 's chair at the long table ? Kindly , quiet , self-effacing Henry ! And poor Rosa ! For all her lively , brisk importance , the real source of her strength had come from Henry . " I shall have to find myself a new lawyer , " Eugene said . " Too bad . He was honest and clever . Unfortunately , those do n't always go together , either . " He tapped the desktop , a habit he had when making a decision . " So . We wo n't go back as planned on the first of the month . You 'll have to be confined here . We 'll summon Dr. Roget . He bought a plantation upriver after he retired . Manufactures rum . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby . " She was enormous , unable to bend and button her strapped slippers . Abby , the chambermaid , remarked darkly , " Might be you having twins , missus . I remember my Auntie Flo died birthing twins . Screamed two days and three nights before she died . It was awful , I stopped my ears . Those twins like to tore her in half before she died . You sees my Auntie Flo 's boys running round here , two big healthy rascals . " Fanny was angry . " Do n't listen to her , Miss Miriam . Did n't the but-  | terfly sit on your arm yesterday ? That 's a good sign , always a good sign . " She wanted not to be afraid . When Pelagie came to visit , Miriam told her of the newspaper article about Queen Victoria , who had taken chloroform when her last child was born . " They say it 's miraculous . One feels no pain , nothing at all . I wish Dr. Roget knew something about it . No one here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not moral . It 's against nature . You 're supposed to feel pain . If you were n't supposed to , you would n't . Does n't that make sense ? " No , it did not . How stupid to believe that whatever is must be right ! Well , that was Pelagie . And yet , to be fair , Pelagie was not really stupid , she was merely unaccustomed to thinking for herself . It came down to that . Anyway , it did n't befit Miriam to judge Pelagie 's reasoning powers . She was n't above some fuzzy , credulous thoughts of her own , like reading omens in nature 's faces . After a gray week during which a melancholy rain dripped steadily from every tree and eave , suddenly one noon the sun pierced the clouds and gray brightened into silver . Not an hour afterward , as if the sunshine had been its herald , David 's letter arrived . I 'm coming home by the first ship that leaves for New Orleans . Now that I 've finished and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decision that will surprise you and I hope make you happy . I 'm coming back to stay . " I ca n't imagine , " Miriam cried , " what made him change his mind ! Do you know it 's eight years since we 've seen him ? Oh , Papa will be so glad ! And he must already be on the way . But whatever made him change his mind ? He was so against everything here . " " Apparently , " Eugene said , " he has acquired some sense . " Immediately she was indignant . " He always had sense . You only know what you 've been told about David . " She began to worry . " I do hope now that Papa and he will finally get along . Perhaps I should talk to Papa and pave the way , so they 'll start out right together . " " You 're too sensitive for your own good . You ca n't take your family 's business on your shoulders . They 'll manage their own affairs . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now you 'll have another responsibility . "  | Toward dawn of a foggy autumn morning Miriam 's labor began . At first she thought it was the harsh call of crows that had awakened her . Then something twisted , rolling in her tautened belly , and she cried out . Fanny came running and Eugene sent Blaise for the doctor . So it started . As the sun broke through the fog and mounted the sky , pain mounted with it . It came in spirals , rising and breaking . Closer and faster , faster and closer , the spirals rose . On the descent the rate was slower ; she could see yellow stripes of sunlight across the ceiling and her own arm lying weakly on the sheet . Then came the rise again , and the world reduced itself to the pit of the belly , where the battle was being fought . On the descent she saw herself as she was being seen : a shameful thing ; above all she must not lose dignity ; her cries must not be heard through the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mouth : I will not scream , I will not scream , I will bear it . Eugene 's face looked down at her . There were the eyebrows , the black caterpillars . She screamed . " Get out ! Leave me ! Go ! Get out ! " " She does n't recognize you , " Fanny whispered , apologizing . They fastened a sheet to the bedpost , making a rope . " Pull ! Pull ! " Fanny urged . The bed creaked , the very wood complaining of Miriam 's strength . Fanny wiped her slippery hands and her forehead . She touched softly , she spoke softly . Fanny is saying something , but I do n't understand the words . Things flash in and out . The doctor 's eyes blink , he does n't know what to do , that 's the trouble , he does n't know what to do . Oh , God , oh , terrible . The sun goes around the house . It feels like evening . Water , she whispers . Her lips do n't move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels Fanny 's arm around her shoulders ; she feels the chill in her mouth and swallows . Pain soars and lifts her high , high , higher , then throws her down . It wo n't ever end . She opens her eyes into a blazing light . " Close the blinds , " someone says , " the sun bothers her . " So it must be morning again . It wo n't ever end . She turns , turns on the pillow . At the side of the bed on the table there burns a veilleuse ; the candle flickers inside the porcelain shape of a lady wearing a ballgown and a powdered wig . Silly lady ! She does n't know anything . But the candle burning ? Then , it must be night again . A man 's voice says : Two days now . Is it the doctor 's or Eugene 's ? It makes no difference . Far off past the window there is a persistent rhythm , drumming and  | clacking . The man 's voice  --  it must be Eugene 's  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no time for a racket . " Rib bones , " she says distinctly . " She 's raving . " No , no , not raving . Rib bones . Over in the quarters they make castanets out of rib bones . Leave them alone . Let them make music . Is she saying it or only thinking it ? Another spiral raises and flings her , crashes and smashes her , against a wall . And again . And again . How long ? The lamp throws a shadow on the ceiling . The shadow runs like water , racing as the candle is moved and is held high . It shines into her face , flickering , wavering , dancing , bobbing . A face looks down on hers , slips into the light and out of it . Eyes come into focus . She strains to see . Eyes in deep sockets , anxious eyes in a white elongated goblin 's face , slipping in and out of shadow . David 's face . Now I am raving , she thinks quite clearly . Words come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miriam . I 'm here . " She hears another voice  --  her own voice ? ? cracking , whispering denial . " No . Not you . Not really you . " " Yes , dear , yes . Really me . I 'm going to help you . " Something passes in swift glimmer from hand to hand , some sharp metal thing . A knife ? A sword ? What are they going to do with it ? She screams . The cords of her neck pull tight with the terror of her scream . " Miriam . Lie back . Do n't be afraid . Just close your eyes . " Something , a hand or a cloth , something light lies over her nose . " Now breathe , dear . Breathe deeply . Do n't be afraid . " A morning light , healthy and clean , washed the room . On white pillows , eased and delivered , Miriam rested . Two swaddled infants lay in twin baskets next to her bed . " Beautiful , are n't they , David ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angelique . I so much wanted to name her Hannah , but Eugene wants Angelique after his mother . " Why not Hannah for my mother ? The boy is named after you . Hannah is an ugly name for a homely girl . My mother was beautiful Aunt Emma said , There 's no point arguing with your husband , Miriam . After all , these are his firstborn , he has a right . His firstborn ? Not mine ?  | Fanny is more clever . Give in , he 'll make you miserable if you do n't . A name 's not worth it . She had been firm about nursing , however . " Eugene wanted to find wet-nurses to take back to the city with us next month , " she told David now , " but I shall nurse my own . I told him so . " " Good for you , " David said . " I 'm proud of you . " " Tell me , " she said softly , " tell me what happened yesterday . I ca n't remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you came in time . I could n't have lasted much longer . " He did not deny that . " I know . We 've chloroform to thank . That 's why I was able to use forceps . It 's a miracle and a mercy . " " You 've learned so much ! " she marveled . He shook his head . " We 've a long way to go . This is only a beginning . " She studied his face . So long since she had seen him ! And as much as she herself had changed , he had changed more . The fire in him seemed to have died away . He was calm and positive . Wearing spectacles , with deep parallel lines on his forehead and a new manner , he was almost sedate . She concluded that the life in New York and the weight of his profession must have done these things to him . " You ca n't know how I have been hoping you would come ! " she cried , almost tearfully . " We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I felt like jumping off and pushing the ship , I was so impatient to get here . " David 's eyes were wet , too . " Anyway , here I am ! And can you guess who 's come with me ? Gabriel . He 's downstairs now . " " I thought he was going to practice law in Charleston . " " He was , but when his sister 's husband died , he felt he had to come here to help rear her sons . A southern sense of duty , it seems . " " So he 's going to stay and you are , too ! I ca n't believe all this ! But you know , Aunt Emma used to tell Papa you would come back , she was sure of it . What made you change your mind , David ? " He got up and stood by the bed , taking her hand between both of his . " I 'd been away from you far too long as it was . Whom else have I got but you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He smiled at the correction . " You first , always . But Papa , too . " The old worry flared . " You 've been talking nicely to him , I hope ? " " Of course I have . Do n't worry , everything 's just fine . Does anger  | still upset you so ? How it used to terrify you when you were a child ! " David was silent for a minute . Then he reflected , " He 's been such a generous father . I owe him so much for my education , a whole future opening for me . And for you , too , Miriam . A generous father . " " He gave me more pearls to celebrate his first grandchildren . Gray pearls . They 're worth a fortune , Eugene says . He says Papa spends too much . Oh , but I still ca n't believe you 've come home to stay , David ! How you hated everything here ! You said such things , you wrote ? " " Remember , I was very young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiser ; at least I hope I 'm wiser , " he said humorously , and as quickly turned serious . " I 've learned that I ca n't change the world , so I might as well get used to it the way it is . " Miriam said slowly , " That does n't sound like you . And it seems so odd that you 've made your peace with the world we have here at the very time I have turned against it . " " Have you really ? " " It 's not that I ever actually approved before , you know . It 's more that I just thought , when I thought at all , that there was nothing one could do about it . It was the way things were . But lately I 've thought maybe there are things one could do , although I do n't know exactly what . " David took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes . They looked tired . " There 's never much that any one person can do . Events take their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David ! It seems to me that 's an excuse for doing nothing ! If I were a man I 'm sure I 'd think of something . " She hesitated . " It 's true that people like Papa and Emma are very kind to their slaves , but still it is not right for them to have such power over other human beings , no matter how kind they are . " " It 's risky to talk that way . You realize that , do n't you ? " " Oh , I know that well enough . And to whom would I talk ? Certainly not to Eugene . He belongs to a vigilance committee . " " Does he ? " " Yes , he and Sylvain . They 're always at meetings in the city and upriver or downriver . " " Really ! Well , people do what they want to do . . . .

A wife would n't fit in with what I intend to do with my life . " " What do you mean ? " " I ca n't please a woman . I 'm restless . I want to work , I 'm not domestic , and I would n't have enough time to give to a wife and a house and babies . " Eugene was standing at the door . " You 'll change your mind .

" I may let him do my legal work now that his brother-in-law is dead . " " I 'm sure you 'll have no reason to regret your choice , " David said formally .

" Sometimes Fanny said foolish things about witches flying over the treetops and such nonsense , yet she also had a lot of plain , good common sense . Eat your lunch and get your strength back . Obediently , Miriam ate the pudding . The babies stirred , waking each other with small grunting noises . They were hungry again , causing the mother 's breasts to tighten with a rush of milk . And she lay there watching the pink waving fists . These two new people were her own ! The world must go its way ; above all she must care for them . Vague intentions flitted through her mind : that the boy might have gentleness with his strength , that the girl might have strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from her mother's.  | From the tiny courtyard of the house on St. Peter Street , one could look back through tall French windows into the office and the room beyond . The office contained a desk , a shelf of books , and a cabinet with medical supplies : dental instruments , pill containers , and amputation saws . The second room was almost bare of furnishings . Gabriel 's hand , holding a coffee cup , paused in midair . " Surely you 're not going to leave the place like this ? You 've been here for months and it looks as though you 'd moved in this morning or were about to move out . " " I 've all I need . A bed , a table , a couple of chairs , and some bookshelves . What else do people want ? " " Well , let 's see . People want carpets , curtains , sofas , pictures , mirrors , many things . " " You sound like my sister . Miriam is constantly after me to fix up . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wo n't let him set you up in a proper office . In short , you puzzle him . You puzzle us all , my friend . " " I do ? " " You know you do . I still have n't fathomed your change of heart . When we were in New York , you used to talk as if we were all poisonous snakes down here . You 'd never go back , you said . You even used to talk about bringing Miriam up North . " " I was sixteen when I said that and she was all of nine , " David answered evasively . Something was being held back , Gabriel thought . Since long before they had both left the North , he had sensed something vaguely secretive under his friend 's familiar manner . Troubled and anxious now , he waited . Dust motes hovered in a bar of sunshine to settle in a fine soft  | film on the floor and on his shoes . And David 's eyes , cast down , also seemed to be following the dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change things . " " To change things ! " " Yes . What use am I sitting up North and talking my heart out about the southern system ? Talk is easy . Enough steam comes out of talk to drive a thousand machines . So it came to me that I must act instead . " " And how do you plan to act ? " David understood that his friend 's calmness was only on the surface . So he said reassuringly , " Do n't worry . I wo n't get anyone into trouble . You can depend on that . " " What about getting yourself into trouble ? " " I 'll certainly try not to . But sometimes you have to stand up for what you believe in . Does that sound too noble ? " He paused . " I just heard my own voice and I 'm afraid it had a pompous ring . But I ca n't help it , I 'm only speaking the truth . " Lines of strain and agitation marked David 's face . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change things , David . You are David , remember ? They 're Goliath . " " Ah , but David slew Goliath . Remember ? " " Well , all right . It was a poor comparison . But listen , " Gabriel said earnestly . " Remember when we were boys on the Mirabelle and we were in Bordeaux . There were rows of abandoned mansions and warehouses falling apart , all the grandeur and riches rotted away . Why ? Because the slave trade had been outlawed . You will see the same here , David . Mark my words . It 's only a matter of time and patience . But the time 's not yet . " " And it wo n't be for another century if it 's allowed to go at its own pace . The system 's too profitable . The cotton gin has increased the value of cotton a hundred times over . The steam engine and the sugar mills have doubled the value of Louisiana 's plantations . The upper South produces far more slaves than it needs to work the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we 're expanding , we keep needing more slaves . Why , a trader can double his investment in a matter of days by buying in Virginia and selling in Louisiana ! I read a study of that when I was in New York . I have the figures somewhere here to show you . " " So you want to hurry things up ? How ? With a bloody war ? You 've got to be out of your head if you want that . " " There 's a fascinating book , " David said . " I 've got it here , hidden away , of course . It 's called The Partisan Leader , about southern states  | founding their own government and the war that results . Terrifying , and maybe accurate , God only knows . I 'll lend it to you if you want . " " No , thank you , I do n't want . And so you 're going to be a partisan leader , is that it ? " David nodded . He sat up straighter in the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're mad . " " I know . You said that before . " David 's smile was almost affectionate . A young Negro man shook a broom out of the kitchen door and closed the door again . When the door had closed , Gabriel warned , " Servants talk . I hope you know enough at least to keep a good rein on your tongue . " " Lucien wo n't talk . We 're on the same side . He helps me . That 's why I hired him . " " Hired him ! " " Yes , he 's a free Negro . I pay him wages . Did you think I would own a slave ? " And again David 's eyes flashed . A fever is burning in him , Gabriel thought . He asked cautiously , " Does anyone else know about this ? " " If anyone did , do you think I would betray him ? " " You answer all my questions with questions , " Gabriel said with some exasperation . The other laughed . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " David , I 'm very serious . Have you ever hinted at this business to your sister ? " " Of course I have n't . Do you honestly believe I would put Miriam in danger ? The person who means more to me than the rest of the world put together ? " " Questions again ! I can only say I should hope you would n't . There are people in that family who would  --  I ca n't think what they would do ! " " Believe me , I know that , Gabriel . " " They called a special grand jury here only a few years ago to investigate the abolitionist movement . Sylvain Labouisse was on it . They recommended a permanent military force to protect against an uprising . Sylvain 's in that , too . Oh , you 're playing with a terrible fire , David ! " " I understand that . " David spoke gravely . " Let me tell you something else . Your own brother-in-law , Eugene ? I betray no confidence when I tell you this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of a vigilance committee to combat sedi-  | tion . He 's a man of great influence , make no mistake . He 's already a power in the Democratic party . " " They sicken me , all of them ! You ca n't know how they sicken me ! " And David 's mouth puckered in disgust . Gabriel sighed . " I know . But we 're not all evil men here in the South , remember that , David . When I was in England I saw more suffering than you will ever see here . Hunger and rags in those cold tenements . . .. And in Massachusetts , all the young village girls in the mills ? " " An accurate description , I 've no doubt , but still irrelevant , " David interrupted . " You ca n't deny we 're making progress , either . Take Dyson 's school for free Negroes ? " " What do you know about Dyson ? " There was an edge of sharpness in the question that surprised Gabriel . He answered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a fine thing for a white man to be doing . You see , " he explained earnestly , " we are getting somewhere , but it has to be gradual , you ca n't just turn everything around overnight . Take your own servant ? " " Yes , take him ! He had to buy his freedom ! And even now he ca n't vote or sit where he wants in a theater ! Lucien Bonnet , decent , intelli-gent ? " Gabriel threw up his hand . " Wait ! I 'm not arguing , I agree with you . I 'm only saying , you 're in too much of a hurry , it wo n't work . " There was nothing new in all this . Too often David had heard these apologies . Time was all you needed before these wrongs would right themselves . Why , not so long ago people in New York City had owned slaves ! Why , in Virginia fifteen or twenty years ago even the Richmond Enquirer was writing articles in favor of emancipation ! And what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fury , caused the Nat Turner insurrection , and there you were , with everything set back God knows how long , just because outsiders were in too much of a hurry . Yes , he had heard all that before , and now was silent . " So that 's not the way , " Gabriel said . " Oh , it 's easy enough for the North to condemn ! Slaves do n't fit into the industrial economy ! It 's easy for Garrison and his ilk to demand an immediate end to the system in the South , but how to do it without ruining the economy here and creating chaos ? The slaughter could be terrible , when you whip up passions among the ignorant ! You of all people , with your family 's history , must understand what mobs are capable of doing . "  | " I do understand . " " Well , then ! Only a few years ago they were plotting slave rebellions in Madison and Carroll parishes . Fortunately , they were found out in time . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reasonable , political organization ? " " But it wo n't stop at that ! You 'll have clandestine meetings , you 'll be found out , there will be terrible punishment , then violent retribution , and it will all come to nothing in the end . No , David , there is no way except to work slowly and patiently within the law . Time and the law will do it . " " Spoken like a lawyer . " " Well , I am a lawyer . " Abruptly David moved on to another subject . " Where are you off to this afternoon ? " Gabriel accepted with grace . " A committee meeting with Gershom Kursheedt . We 've come along very well with our new congregation ? the Dispersed of Judah , it 's to be called . We 're going back from the German rite to the Portuguese . " " Too aristocratic to mingle with Germans ? Sorry , nothing personal . " David smiled . " Of course it would be ideal if we were all the same . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways , that 's all . Especially now that the antisemitic laws in Europe are bringing in so many Germans . However , I must tell you , " Gabriel said enthusiastically , " Kursheedt has been doing wonders with Judah Touro . He 's got him to subscribe a lot of money for the synagogue and other charities . No one can figure out how he 's done it , unless it 's a question of timing . Touro 's getting old and afraid to die . " " There you are ! The power of persuasion toward the right . Is n't that what I 've just been talking about today ? " " Not quite , David . Not quite . " Now it was Gabriel who moved away from the subject . " Kursheedt is a sort of disciple of Isaac Leeser 's . Now , there 's a great man , Leeser . A prolific writer . You ought to read his Occident and American Jewish Advocate . It comes out every month , tells you what 's going on in Jewish life around the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly . However , he 's a bachelor with few wants . " " Like me . A bachelor with few wants . " " David , I came by this afternoon to ask you whether you 'd want to  | work with us in Jewish charities . There are so many committees that need workers . But I ca n't recruit you if you 're going to get mixed up in that other business . You understand ? " " Perfectly . Your meaning 's quite clear . " David 's tone was unmistakably bitter . " I 'm not welcome . " " Do n't be bitter about it . Would you want to drag others down ? Your sister , for instance ? " " I told you a while ago that I would n't , did n't I ? Yet , I ca n't help but think : How fortunate for the southern Jew that the Negro exists ! He takes the brunt of prejudice away , and now the Jew is freely accepted in the best society . " " That 's not fair , David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll grant there may be some excuse for people like you who 've been born into the system and grown up in it , but for those of us from Europe who ought to know better , there can be no excuse . " " We are only doing what the rest of society is doing . We are people like everyone else . We 're not all as noble as the prophets . " " We 're the People of the Covenant . A greater sense of justice is required of us . Examine our history ? " Gabriel rose to leave . " I have n't made your deep analysis , " he said with slight stiffness . David went with him through the house to the street . " Do n't be angry with me . Must we think alike on everything to be friends ? " " No , not at all . I 'm not angry , either , only distressed . Take care of yourself , David . " For a few minutes David stood in the doorway watching Gabriel go down the street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could trust him with all you had or ever hoped to have . A fine mind , a scholar , with deep warmth beneath the austerity . But slow , too slow , not a man to accomplish things . More 's the pity . He sighed . The afternoon 's talk had tired him . He was too tired of late , but it was no wonder . Talk of burning candles at both ends ! All the organizing , the planning , and the tension of utmost secrecy , while keeping all the time a " normal exterior , " which meant a minimal social life for the world to see . Often he wished that the social life might be more than miMmal , that he might allow himself more than a dance or casual chat with one of the delightful girls who were so eager to welcome the young doctor , the son of Ferdinand Raphael . And he smiled to himself , with a certain wistfulness , this " eligible young man " who was not really eligible at all : Mar-  | riage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the South . So , in all decency , he must keep his distance and , when any young woman seemed to be especially charming , must be careful to stay away . He was wearying beneath many pressures . The practice had grown rapidly . It had begun one night when a midwife who had somehow or other heard his name had appealed for help with a hard delivery . And he had gone down to the Irish Channel , stumbling over goats and drunks , and in a shanty behind the slaughterhouse brought a life into the world . What stench , what misery ! In the North he had heard the diatribes of the Know-Nothing party and seen signs on shop doors : NO IRISH WANTED HERE . They were condemned for being shiftless and unclean . When people were ground down they were blamed for every plague , as were the Jews in Europe . Never , never did he see cruelty of any kind without thinking of his mother . And David burned with furious conviction . Things ought not ? the world ought not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How was it possible that his father had no such burning ? I try to understand . I do understand more clearly than I could have when I was fifteen . He 's had his struggle and used up his ambition ; now he wants only to enjoy what he has . How glad he is to have his son back ! And inevitably I shall bring him pain again . I shall be sorry when it happens . He 's a good man . No one could be more generous than he with his overflowing house : Emma 's Georgia relatives , flocking to new land in Louisiana , as the value of Sea Island cotton sank , all stayed first with the Raphaels . Her extravagant relatives from upriver , living the reckless life of wealth even when they had no wealth , spent their winters during the opera season at the Raphaels ' . Such was Ferdinand 's bounty . David turned back into the house . Lucien , cooking the plain supper , sang . Of course , this frugal house , this single servant , baffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wanted his son to make a splendid marriage with the daughter of a powerful family . At least his daughter had done so . Only a few nights ago David had dreamed of Miriam , such a strange dream , jumbled with some recollection of a deer . Last fall at Beau Jardin Eugene had shot one , a soft fawncolored thing . He 'd flung it down on the grass where it lay with its eyes wide open , sightless before the bright day and the bright woods in which it had been running with the wind when it was brought down .  | Miriam had turned away and Eugene had been annoyed with her . All that had been in his dream . She was so charming , his little sister ! Her babies were walking now , holding her skirts for support . They made a portrait , delicate as ivory with their pale silks and their heavy black silk hair . He could still remember Miriam in drab wool , cold and shivering in the stony kitchen on the Judengasse . He supposed she had forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It saddened him that he had been away from her for so long . He felt that he hardly knew her . And he wished he could like her husband better . He wished he could be sure that Miriam was content with Eugene . He wondered whether he imagined sorrow in her face ; sometimes it seemed as though a gray veil had been drawn across it . And it came to him suddenly that never , in all the quiet family evenings , at the dinner table , or with the children in the parlor , had he heard a word , or seen a touch , a glance , a laugh , between the husband and wife that reflected any tenderness , any bond . Perhaps it was only their way ? And yet he began to wonder . The man was so unlike Miriam . He talked business ; he talked money . Even when he did n't speak the word , money was what he was talking about . When he spoke of the war with Mexico and of high democratic principles , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had learned not to dispute these things at anybody 's table . It was important that he not be identified as a radical or " different . " His manner of living was already different enough . He must not be a breaker of idols . Small eccentricities were permissible , perhaps even , to a degree , interesting . But in essence he must seem to fit into the society . " Lucien , " he called , " when you 're finished in the kitchen , will you see that my suit 's presentable ? " He was off to the St. Charles Theater with some colleagues that evening to see Edwin Booth . Get tickets for Joe Jefferson 's performance the week after next , he reminded himself . You 're a young doctor on the way up , you know , a trifle odd , but very pleasant . " Lives like a monk , " he 'd overheard someone say recently about him . It had been said without malice , only with a certain kindly amusement . An instant 's fear now darted in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon ? No , no , Gabriel was an honorable man , there was nothing to fear . He must be more discreet in the future , nevertheless .  | Gabriel Carvalho was troubled . He tried , as he walked along the street , to recall the exact wording of his conversation with David . Had he pointed out that even the most peaceable discussion , the most peaceable meeting , was dangerous ? But surely David must know that ! One could n't live here without having some understanding of the way things were . So then , knowing all that , David was determined to go ahead . In essence , of course , he was right ; the end was right , but one had also to consider the means , the cost of reaching that end . You could say that a man like David was still a boy , high-minded but thoroughly impractical , whose efforts would prove futile , if not fatal . Or you could say that he was one of those who throughout history had moved the world forward , sacrificing themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of regret he thought , Perhaps I am one of the too cautious ones , seeing what is right but counting the cost of achieving it as too high and the way too difficult , while we wait for others to do it . David sees to the essence of things . I see the complexities . He was half aware of the opinion people had of him : that he was prudent , " lawyerish , " and deliberate ; that , in a word , he lacked spark . Some , he was aware , even thought he was chilly or snobbish ; these appellations hurt , since he knew he was neither . He was reserved and had been since childhood , holding his emotion in restraint because , once having let go , he knew he would display too much . His head must keep control of a wild heart , perhaps even a wilder heart than David 's . Abruptly his mind went back to the voyage of the Mirabelle , so long ago . He had been in Europe twice since then , once for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rhine , but that voyage of the Mirabelle was more vivid in his memory than either of those other times . For it was then that he had found and made the closest friend he had yet had . In spite of all differences of background , of temperament , and often of conviction , the admiration and the trust remained , so that each truly cared what happened to the other . It was a rare thing , this caring , not to be explained , he supposed , any more than one could explain the love between woman and man . Again to the Mirabelle ; to David , foundering , terrified , in the trough of the waves ; to the dog 's piteous bobbing head ; to the crying , grateful child . He had quite forgotten that child , but now , however seldom he saw her on some social occasion , that picture kept recurring . The contrast between this recollection of her and what she now was had come to seem incredibly strange , which was actually foolish of him , since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child should become a woman , a married woman with children . Biblical phrases came to his mind : cedars of Lebanon , the green bay tree . Supple as a young tree she stood , with her creamy shoulders and her waist emerging from the absurd concealing bell of her skirts so that one could only imagine the body beneath them . He stopped himself . To linger over thoughts like these ! She was another man 's wife  --  his client 's wife . One respected Eugene Mendes . Intelligent and forceful , secure in his achievements , he commanded respect . Yet something in his gaze made it an effort to meet that gaze . Perhaps it was your feeling that he was taking your measure , calculating your deficits and strengths . He seemed a strange choice for Miriam Raphael ! It did not seem as if those two could be united . Were not a man and woman supposed to become as one ? And he thought again of the wistfulness about her lips . Unlike other women at a dinner table , who were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle dream , as though she were expecting something , or even as though she were not there at all . And yet once , passing the Mendes 's garden wall , he had heard delightful laughter , gay as bells , and peering in , had been astonished to see that the laughter was hers . She had been playing with her children , throwing a ball . Her hair had come loose ; her hat had come off and the little boy was wearing it , a huge white straw with blue ribbons . An alligator killed the dog , he remembered suddenly . Why not replace it ? And it seemed that the dog had been a link between them , as if his rescue of it had been a portent of  --  of what ? A portent of nothing , he thought impatiently , becoming annoyed with himself . She 's my friend 's sister . A thoughtful gesture from me to her would be acceptable and pleasing . Had he not bought a doll a while ago for the child of a friend , to replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , he would order a puppy from New York ; one of the men in the office where he had worked raised King Charles spaniels . He could have it sent safely by ship . And he imagined her face when he put the dog in her arms . She would blush pink with pleasure , he thought , recalling how easily she blushed , and how her smile bloomed . It was perfectly proper , a simple gift to a friend . Turning the corner into the Place d'Armes , Gabriel was jolted back to the present by the proud blare of a brass band . A crowd was gathering in the square , where among tents and flags , a regiment had formed into marching order . After a quick glance he passed through the square .  | The Mexican War was popular , especially in the South . I have no stomach for it , Gabriel thought , as the band 's blare faded from his ears , no stomach at all . Oh , probably it 's not " manly " to think that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 0 Lord , thy most precious gift . Nothing is simple . There are so many sides to everything . As one turns the prism , the purest light reflects now from here , and then from there ; as one turns , turns . . . Anyway , I have responsibilities and could n't volunteer even if I were wild to go . Rosa was still tearful in black and jet beads . Always she had appeared to dominate Henry , but now that he was gone , it was plain that she had depended on him . He had not left a great deal of money , and understandably , she wanted to stay with her children in their comfortable house . So Gabriel must now contribute . Fortunately , his prospects were good . He had a new office in the Banks Arcade , a prime location . He had , for a start , a list of clients inherited from Henry , mostly prosperous up-and-coming men like Eugene Mendes . I should n't like to be his enemy , he thought unexpectedly . And he hastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had caught up with him . Miriam , on her way home from the French Market with Fanny , caught the last of the trooping flags and drums as they swept out of sight and hearing . Silence flowed back . The side streets were empty except for the milk wagon clattering its brass-bound cans and the old Negro with the ice cream freezer on his head crying : " Creme d la glace ! Creme d la glace ! " " Look , " said Miriam , " is n't that Mr. Mendes leaving that house ? " " I ca n't tell from here , Miss Miriam . " " But surely it is , in his new maroon coat . " The maroon coat hurried down the street and disappeared at the corner . A moment later a woman came out of the house and waited for a carriage that was just emerging from the carriage house in the alley . Miriam and Fanny came abreast as the carriage drew up to let the woman enter it . She was a magnificent quadroon . Strong daylight glittered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tassels and gold leather slippers . A coal-black servant followed her , carrying a basket like that which Fanny was carrying for Miriam . The young woman 's frankly curious eyes met Miriam 's for just an instant ; then , lowering her eyes at once , she stepped into the carriage and drove away .  | " Who was that , Fanny ? " " Why , Miss Miriam , you know . One of those . I do n't like to say , " Fanny said primly . " Of course I know what she is . I meant , she recognized me . " " How could she ever know a lady like you , Miss Miriam ? " Now Fanny was shrill . " But she did , " Miriam insisted . " I even felt for a second that she was about to speak to me . " " She would n't dare ! She would n't dare talk to a white lady . Queen 's far too smart for that . " " Queen ? Is that her name ? And , Fanny , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . You saw it as well as I did . " " I do n't know what I saw , Miss Miriam . Please do n't ask me what I saw , " Fanny pleaded . " You 're trembling , for heaven 's sake ! Do n't drop the basket or you 'll have those berries all over the street . Now , Fanny , tell me , what are you keeping back ? " " Nothing , Miss Miriam . I swear I 'm not . " " I do n't believe you . Listen here , Fanny , did I save Blaise for you ? We 've grown up together . You owe me something in return . " " Miss Miriam , " Fanny said desperately . She panted , keeping up with Miriam 's hurried steps . " Listen , if I do know anything , it 's nothing that 'll do you any good . Nothing you 'll be happier knowing . " " Let 's not talk about doing me good . I do n't want to be made a fool of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's happening . " Fanny was silent and Miriam said gently , " I know you 're scared to talk . So I 'll talk and you 'll just nod your head if I 'm right and shake it if I 'm wrong . Mr. Mendes and that  --  that Queen . He goes there all the time ? " Fanny nodded . Her frightened eyes were wet . " And he has been going there . He and she have been  --  together a long time ? " " I do n't know how long , Miss Miriam , I swear I do n't . I only know what I hear . I did n't tell you anything , did I ? You are n't going to tell Mr. Eugene that I told you anything , are you ? He 'll beat me . " " He wo n't do that , Fanny . He has never beaten anyone , you know that perfectly well . And I would n't let him even if he wanted to . " " But he 'd send me away , " Fanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But you 're not gon na tell him ? "  | " No . Go wash your face . Take the basket to the kitchen and wash your face . I 'll just sit here in the garden awhile . " The fountain goddess , goddess of love , stood in her marble calm above the double cascade . On the wall plaque opposite the bench where Miriam sat , the name of the young wife who was buried there had been obscured by the droop of the trumpet vine . Had the girl Aimee been sick with strife and doubting as I am ? Or had she known from the beginning where she was going ? Miriam frowned . What was she really feeling at this moment ? She tried to get outside herself , to see herself as an observer might . Chiefly then , it was pride that she saw . But why should she mind ? Why care ? In fact , she ought even to be grateful to that woman for taking care of Eugene 's needs . Rarely now , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake her as he had when they were away at Beau Jardin . Liaisons of this sort were common . No girl , however sheltered , could have lived in this city without knowing about them . The weekly quadroon balls at the Washington Ballroom were freely advertised . The girls were so beautiful that often the white balls emptied out early and everyone knew that the young men were bound next for the Washington and its beautiful quadroons . Everyone knew , although no one talked except Rosa , blunt , chatty Rosa . " Oh , those women are very well brought up , " she had told Miriam . " You 'd be surprised ! A man never touches one before being accepted by her mother . Then he has to set the daughter and the mother up in a nice little house and take care of them . It 's an expensive hobby . He has to promise to support the children , too , should there be any . But , " she added soberly , " sometimes it really is a case of love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on seeing the mistress even after making a good marriage . " So that 's what it was . Fanny knew and had known . Without a doubt all the servants had . She wondered whether Rosa had . She did n't want to know whether Rosa had . She did n't want to be angry at Rosa . Presently Eugene 's rapid heavy steps sounded from the gallery . The front door opened and closed . A moment later voices came from the open windows upstairs . He had gone to the children 's rooms , where they would just now be waking from their naps . He would go there first to toss the boy into the air , to make mock fists and pretend to pummel him ; the boy would squeal , laughing with excitement over his father 's lavish love ; his round hot cheeks would go red and his eyes would flash . Then the father would clasp him , ruffling his hair . To Angelique , Eu-  | gene brought proper tribute ; a white lace dress , a French bisque doll , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy he gave his own heart . Now Eugene came down to the garden . He regarded Miriam curiously . " What are you doing here ? " " Thinking , " she answered , dinging the word like a stone . " Well , " he said dryly , " that 's always a worthy occupation . Of what are you thinking , may I ask ? " " Of why you pretended you did n't see me a little while ago . " " See you ? Where should I have seen you ? " " You ran around the corner of Chartres Street . Please do n't say you did n't . I ca n't abide a liar . " " I beg your pardon ! " Eugene said furiously . Miriam stood up . Her pulsebeat was loud in her ears . " I know why you were there . I know about Queen . " His eyebrows , those eyebrows that she hated , slid upward . Black caterpillars . " Where did you hear that name ? " " Does it matter ? I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either , I 'm warning you . " " I sha n't lie . I simply do n't intend to tell you . " " Was it Fanny ? It was Fanny , was n't it ? No ? Lucetta ? Blaise ? Some meddling snooper from your father 's house ? That miserable pair , Maxim and Chanute ? " " It makes no difference , I tell you . They all knew it . Everyone did except me . " Eugene had removed his gloves ; she saw that his hands were trembling . He looked past her to the drowsing dove at the feet of the little goddess . " Well , " he said after a minute , " since you know what you know , you might as well hear the rest . " He met Miriam 's eyes . His own , so severe and sharp whenever he turned them to her , now had a tender shine . " I have  --  there is  --  a child . A son . My other son . He 's seven years old . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So it had been going on that long . At the time of their marriage and long before that . Another child , another boy , not hers . Here was a bewilderment of possibilities . She was aware of them standing there like two people who had just met , who knew nothing about each other . " Then why did you marry me ? " she whispered . " Surely not for money or position . You have ten times more than I have of either one . " " I wanted a son who could be recognized as mine . A boy with my  | name who would be educated here and have a future in this city . That 's what I wanted . " Now she began to feel . Tears stung in back of her eyes . She was furious with her stupid tears . " Oh ! " she cried . " I know I was ignorant when I married you , ignorant as no girl ought to be and as we all are , but now I think I was mad besides ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who wanted ? a brood mare ! " " No , you 're wrong . I wanted much more than that . I would n't have asked you if I had n't intended to make it work . I wanted a refined and beautiful young wife to give me a son and make a family . What is unnatural about that ? But you did n't give it a chance . " She could not deny it . " At first I thought I understood . A modest young girl , I thought . It will take a little time . But the time never came . Of course a man does n't expect his wife to be like  --  well , a wife is a lady , after all , and the man knows that . But you ! You 're ice . You 're as cold as that statue . What is it ? Am I dirty ? I ask myself . No , I am not . What , then ? Ugly ? It 's not generally thought so . Coarse , then ? I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do you find me disgusting ? Because you do , and you ca n't deny it . " He waited for her answer . She could only answer miserably and with reluctance , " I do n't know . " How tell him : I ca n't bear your slightest touch , my teeth clench when you come near me . " If there had been the least response from you , if you had  --  well , what 's the use ? I might have ended that other affair . I probably would have . But as it was . . . " Never could she have imagined Eugene Mendes as a supplicant ; it was never his way to ask , only to require . Now he stood before her , this foremost citizen in his velvet waistcoat with his hands still trembling as they held his buckskin gloves . " Why ? " he repeated . " Tell me . What 's wrong with me ? " She looked down at the grass , at Eugene 's feet on the grass . His fine London shoes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything was very still . A locust drilled abruptly , and as abruptly cut itself off . She had not thought of Eugene before as a human being who could be hurt ; it was always he who did the hurting . But of course he had been wounded in the very core of his manhood . To be rejected even by a woman one did n't love must make a man doubt himself , even when there was another woman waiting with wide-open  | arms . She remembered the flash of those black , startled eyes and all the golden glitter , But it was nobody 's fault . She saw that suddenly and clearly . It was only a fact that he repelled her , a thing that had happened , like having a taste for gooseberries or an aversion to milk . " Why ? " Eugene insisted . Her mouth was dry with fear . It was like standing on a cliff ; since one could not go forward and certainly not backward , there remained only to go to the right or the left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She faltered , " I suppose it 's just that some people do n't suit each other . I tried . I did try . " " Perhaps , " Eugene said , " someone else would suit you better , then ? Gabriel Carvalho , perhaps ? He ca n't take his eyes away from you . Would he suit you better , do you think ? " She slapped him . Without thought , without conscious will , her hand came up and stung his cheek . The scorn on his face changed to a furious astonishment . Terrified at what she had done , she stepped back . He grasped her wrists and they stood there staring , ready to strike . " Because you have a trollop , you think that I must be doing what you " " I take it back . You have n't life enough in you ! " " My God , how I hate you ! " she cried . " Lower your voice . Keep your dignity if you can . " " Oh , you 're the right one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I am . I have done nothing that other men in my position do n't do . I told you , if you had been a proper wife to me , I would have done differently . But whether I did or not , a proper wife would know how to keep out of her husband 's concerns . " " Then , I am not a proper wife ! " " You are not a wife at all . " " But she  --  that woman  --  she is . " Eugene released her hands . " Yes , " he said simply , " yes . She is . " On the other side of the wall a vendor passed , calling , " Strawberries ! Fresh and nice , nice and fresh ! " The sound of his drawl will stay in my ears , Miriam thought . Such moments mark a life : that sleepy voice , the powdery hot dust and the scent of Eugene 's eau de cologne  --  these will remain . She thought of something else . " You should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and untrue . " " Perhaps I should not . Yes , you 're right , I should not . He 's a decent  | gentleman . And you 're the mother of my children , the mistress of my house . Let us remember it . Let us live here in decency . " " In decency , " she said . " DO what is expected of you and I shall never touch you again . You have my pledge of that . Do you understand ? " " Yes . " " You need n't worry . I do n't even want you anymore . " For a moment they waited as if they did not know what came next . Then Eugene said , " I 'm sorry . I 'm really sorry . " " We 're tied together in such falsehood . Tied . " She turned her palms up in a hopeless gesture . " Forever , do you realize that ? " He nodded . And there being nothing more to say , he turned about and went back into the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A heavy rain swept through the trees and dripped from the roof , splashing her dress and her hair . In the smoky light of the streetlamp at the corner she could see Blaise and the stack of wooden boxes with which he took people dry-shod across the flooded street . She wondered whether he was saving his earnings to buy his freedom . And it occurred to her how odd it was that Blaise had some possibility of freedom , whereas she had none . " Miss Miriam , " Fanny called . " I been looking for you everyplace . What you doing out there in this rain ? Are n't you ever coming in ? " Miriam 's dress had gone limp and her hair had been torn about by the wind . Emma always said a lady should never allow anyone to see her looking less than her best . What would Emma have to say about Queen ? " Oh , it 's the way men are , " she would say . Miriam could hear her voice , slightly embarrassed and slightly superior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wife should never let on that she knows . It would n't do any good , only make him angry . Best to look the other way . And if he treats you well , what difference does it make ? " Yes , certainly Emma would say that . So would Pelagie . And Rosa , so totally different from either of those two , would very likely say it also . Why do I care ? I have no reason to care what Eugene does . And the answer came : because he is free to take what he wants from life , while you are not . That 's why . Impatiently she tore at her buttons . " You 're ruining your dress ! Here , let me , " Fanny cried .  | " I do n't care . It 's ruined anyway . " Wet petticoats dropped to the floor . " Fanny , tell me . You can talk truly to me now . Mr. Mendes has told me everything . The boy , Queen 's boy , have you ever seen him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry . " Fanny picked up the petticoats . " Yes , miss , I know her boy . He looks like Queen , maybe lighter than Queen . " Then he must be a handsome child . And now Miriam felt a thrust of jealousy , not for herself , God knew , but on behalf of her own little Eugene , whose father 's love must surely be divided between him and that other son . At the same time she knew this was not rational . She thought out loud , repeating herself . " Then , he must be a handsome child . " " Yes . Smart , too . " Relieved from secrecy and fear , Fanny now rushed to tell her what she knew . " Queen belonged to Mr. Mendes 's family . She some kind of cousin , I think . Then he freed her , but not the boy . He still owns the boy . " To " own " one 's child ! It was all so queer and strange ! The silence , when Fanny stopped talking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw distorted goblin figures and mocking faces on the wall ; the walls pressed themselves in and began to spin ... . " He crazy about that boy , " Fanny resumed . " Ashamed , too . " She sighed . " But that 's the way it always is . Nothing new about that . " She must pull herself together , keep hold . Things must not fly apart ; the solid house must shelter her children , no matter what it cost ; she must keep herself sane , must " I know something you could do , " Fanny said suddenly . " Do ? What do you mean ? " " I could get you a black candle . If you want to hurt somebody , you know , like hurting Queen or " ? she came closer to Miriam , whispering ? " or Mr. Eugene , you write the name on a piece of paper and pin it on the candle . When the candle burns all the way down , the person will have awful sickness and pain . " This foolishness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You do n't believe such nonsense ! You 're too smart for that . " Ashamed , Fanny laughed . " Well , you 're right , I guess . Still , sometimes I 'm not so sure . I 've seen things . Shall I get you some tea ? Laurelleaf tea for stomachache ? " " Just plain tea . It 's not my stomach that aches . " " Not your heart , either . "  | " No . What is it , then ? " " Your head is thinking what you 're going to do all your life . " " You 're right . That 's what my head is thinking . " There was such a fluttering within her that she had to move . She went to the window . Thunder , moving westward , still rolled . By the weak light of the streetlamp she saw that Blaise had left , having found , no doubt , that there were not enough customers tonight to make it worth his while to stand in the rain . Eugene , as always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle and went to her desk , where a little stack of notices and invitations waited to be answered . Leafing through them , she read : the Society for the Visiting of the Sick ; a wedding announcement ; a birthday dinner for one of Emma 's more distant cousins ; a meeting of the Hebrew Benevolent Society for the Relief of the Aged . The annual ball was to be next month and every fashionable member of the Jewish community would be there . She would need a new dress . Things collapsed , but nevertheless one needed a dress . Gabriel Carvalho was one of the officers . He ca n't take his eyes away from you , Eugene had said . She did n't believe it . Certainly she had never noticed . To begin with , he seldom spoke to her directly and then only to mention something about their long-ago voyage , or about the dog , or else some polite comment about how the children were growing . He was  --  well , stiff . Yes , that was the word , stiff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shy . Yet how could a man as successful as Gabriel was be shy ? True , he never talked very much , even among the men ; it was always David or Eugene who had so much to say , Eugene commanding and David enthusiastic . But then , they always turned to him for the final say , did n't they ? It was really puzzling , when you thought about it . But she had no wish to think about it . For whatever the reason , Gabriel was aloof , so let him be so ! Rosa thought he was handsome . Naturally . He was her brother . Well , perhaps he was . He had fine , thoughtful eyes , an austere expression . But what Eugene had said today was untrue . He had even admitted that it was untrue . Unconsciously , Miriam made a pretty shrug as she straightened the papers and prepared for bed . But she did not sleep . She moved to the very edge of the bed , thankful that it was a wide bed , since Eugene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her until the end of their days . It was so cruel ! A useless woman till the end of those days ! Two  | children she had , and now no more . In two more years they would be in school and would not need her to read stories to them , or go on morning walks . Indeed , they scarcely needed her now ; their nurses did almost everything for them , anyway . Often she liked to send the nurses out and give them their baths herself ; it moved her heart to see how tall and firm they were , how Angelique , young as she was , had already begun to show the graceful indentation at the waist which is so feminine , while Eugene was so compact and square . His sister was voluble , her talk a string of questions : Why must we ? Who was that lady ? Where are those people going ? Eugene could amuse himself for hours . He had a tower of blocks in his room as high as his waist . It will reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be over ; they will grow up and go away . Then what would be left for their mother ? To spend her life making wax flowers to put in glass bells or embroidering dresses for other women 's babies ? And her thoughts went to Eulalie , busy with christening clothes , exquisite as bridal veils ; to the feeble body and the eyes so filled with misery even when she wore the " social smile " that was expected of her . Yes , Miriam thought , there is little you could tell Eulalie about suffering . One did not like Eulalie ; a Jew especially could not like a person who in his heart despised a Jew ; yet one could understand her . Who am I ? Mrs. Eugene Mendes . What is she ? What does she do ? If I had a talent , a voice maybe , like that girl Marie Claire , I know what I 'd do . She wants to go abroad to study , but her mother wo n't let her , Rosa says . I 'd find a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would , but I do n't know anything . It 's not right ! Men can learn . They earn money and dispense it as they please . We have to ask for it . A man can preach chastity while he keeps a mistress . He can do whatever he wants . I could hate men , but I do n't want to . I want to love one man . I want a reason to love him . I 've been asking for that ever since I was old enough to know the meaning of the word . Maybe I still do n't know the meaning of the word .  | It was late autumn , but still very warm in the courtyard at the Raphael house , where preparations for an elaborate party were almost complete . True to his promise to " look after " his late partner 's daughter , Ferdinand was giving a dance in honor of Marie Claire 's engagement to Andre Perrin of Natchez . " It is remarkable , Mama says , " Pelagie observed , " that he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never met him ? " Miriam answered carelessly , " No , but Eugene has . They 've had some business dealings , I believe . " " He 's quite handsome . Wait till you see . " There was a cheerful bustle under the piazza where they were standing . Sisyphus was setting the great silver coffee urns in place , these being his special responsibility and pride ; Chanute and Maxim carried in the last of the potted hydrangeas . Paper lanterns trembled in a mild breeze , and the orchestra , tuning , made the expectant sound that said that the curtain would shortly rise . Except for the absence of a bridal canopy , it was exactly like Miriam 's wedding scene . Having no wish to recall that scene , she turned away to inquire of Pelagie where Marie Claire might be . " In the guest bedroom with Mama . They 're all flustered . Some of the ruching came loose on her skirt and her own mother did n't even notice it . Mama did , of course . You can trust her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about every last detail , ca n't you ? She really has put a great deal of effort into this party . " " It 's been two years since I saw Marie Claire . " " I have n't seen her in a while , either , except for the week she spent at our place last summer . This has been a quick romance . Only three weeks . " " Really ? Is she very happy ? "  | " Oh , she never shows how she feels . I sometimes think she does n't feel much at all unless she 's at the piano singing . She accompanies herself , you know . " Miriam remembered a long , sober face . In spite of having seen it so seldom , it rose clearly before her eyes . And with it once more came a strange sensation that their lives would in some way cross . " She certainly ought to be happy now , " Pelagie resumed . " Andre 's charming . He 's of a good family . His mother 's Jewish and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " And she repeated , " It really is remarkable that he 's marrying her with so little . Of course your father is being generous as always . He 's bought her silver and all sorts of nice extravagant things . " Miriam heard herself quoting Eugene . " My father can be too extravagant . " " You know , I 'll tell you something , but do n't dare repeat it . Marie Claire told me that this was her only chance to get to Europe to study voice . Andre has business there for at least a year . Do you suppose she would marry him just for that ? " " I do n't know . I do remember feeling that there was something desperate about her . " " Desperate ? She thinks too much of having a great career . " " Her voice is marvelous , Pelagie . " " Not as marvelous as having the right husband . She wants to study with Manuel Garcia in Paris . She thinks she has a voice like Jenny Lind 's . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she does n't try ? " " It all sounds very grand , I 'm sure , but for myself I would n't change with a hundred Jenny binds . It always seems to me that each of my babies is more miraculous than the last . My little Louie is already sitting up ! And you should see how wonderful Felicia ' is with him , with all the little ones . Can you believe she 's twelve years old ? Such a goodnatured child , a little mother already . In a few years , just think , she will be a real mother . Oh , you 've brought the children ! They 're so sweet , Miriam . I think twins are so sweet . " The twins had appeared in the courtyard to stare at the musicians until Fanny should lead them away . Pink and clean , with their wellkept hair and starched sleeves , they belonged in a picture book . All I have in the world , Miriam thought fiercely , her eyes stretching as if to encompass and devour them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she answered , " so we 're letting them stay up late .. He likes to show off his first grandchildren . " " First ? Are you ? ? " " No , " Miriam said shortly . " I 'm not . " " But , Miriam , the twins are already three . " " I know they are . " Dear Pelagie could be so exasperating ! When Sylvain had bought a city house for the winter season , Miriam had been so glad , but sometimes she felt overwhelmed by Pelagie 's platitudes and hovering , kindly presence . " I 've a headache , " she said abruptly . " I think I 'll go to the yellow guestroom to lie down for a few minutes . " Instead of lying down she confronted herself in the mirror . Earlier that day she had cried again . Now two pink spots glared on her cheekbones and there was a glaze on her eyelids which even the ice that Fanny had brought could not entirely dispel . A fleck of sawdust from the ice still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had cried . When Eugene was in a mood , he made no effort to conceal it . He spoke to her with contempt . " The soup at dinner last night was n't fit to eat . Can you not supervise your servants any better than that ? " She had made a dignified resolve not to let his words touch her . " Speak up ! I ca n't hear when you mumble , especially with that German accent . " She tried to keep herself immune , removed and above him , so that her response to these attacks was to make no response . Unfortunately , she was not always able to control her eyes , which could brim on the instant to overflowing while she kept lips and forehead steady . " Oh , my God , crying again ! " he would say . " Tears , tears , the woman 's weapon . " If only she did not have to share a room with him ! If only there were one place in that large house to which a woman might go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Eugene had left for the day could she be certain of a time alone , pretending to sleep so that even Fanny would not disturb her until she rang . And she would lie there watching the pink light creep across the floor , thinking about nothing and everything . Now he knocked on the door . He was irritable . He had been looking for her .  | " Come . What are you doing in here ? Your father 's asking for you . Turn around . Yes , the dress is good enough . The color suits you for once , puts color in your face . Can you manage a smile ? There are important people here , the cream of the city 's business . " " I 'm coming , " she said softly . Her voice sounded to her ears like a sigh . But then it seemed to her that wives ' voices often did . She had begun to notice such things . Even Pelagie , who was so much in love with Sylvain , seemed to speak in a tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back downstairs . The hall was filling , as if everyone were arriving at once . It was like looking down into a kaleidoscope in which buttons and pins and scraps of bright cloth can be made to whirl into fantastic shapes . Across the hall a dozen candles , casting a ruby glow , had turned the red room into a jewel box . Around the piano Ferdinand 's chosen string quartet had grouped itself to play and sing the old French folk songs , familiar to the house . Ferdinand kissed his daughter . " Come , you 've not met Marie Claire 's fiance . This is Andre Perrin . My daughter , Mrs. Mendes . You 're acquainted with her husband . " Perrin bowed . " Yes , certainly . A brilliant man , Mrs. Mendes . " She saw first the top of a head of strong fair hair , then a lively , frank young face with laugh lines radiating from the eyes . Emma came bustling from the dining room , where she had been inspecting tables . " Andre ! Where 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , there she is ! Marie Claire , how are you , my dear ? But you look adorable " ? as though she had not herself been upstairs only a few minutes before attending to the girl 's dress . Marie Claire gave her earnest smile . She had not changed . Her tight curls were still the color of pale sand and she wore an unbecoming dress of the same dull color . She is so plain , Miriam thought with sudden pity , and he 's so flashing . The engaged pair was drawn away and the party began to split into groups . Old ladies , the married and the widowed , collected around the buffet tables . Why were old people so hungry ? Miriam stood outside herself observing . When I was young , she thought , four years ago when I was young , I was inside things ; now I am outside watching . There 's Sylvain , being chivalrous with Eulalie on his arm . There 's Pelagie 's Felicia with budding breasts and long , still-childish hair . Eugene has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who are here this evening . She stood alone in the swarm . Then it occurred to her to look for David . She saw him too seldom . But a physician 's hours were full . She understood , but wished there could be some long private times with him , uninterrupted ; then perhaps she might talk to him about herself , talk as she could to no one else . And sometimes she fantasized about the two of them , taking the children and running away , running north to free air , released from every burden , every obligation . . . . Fantasy , indeed ! She found him in the small library , sitting over a carafe of wine with Gabriel and Rosa , who was at ease in the company of cigars and men . " Come sit with us , " David said . " We are having a friendly argument about the future of Judaism . " " I 'm only saying , " Gabriel explained , " that so many of the petty laws and superstitions of the Orthodox are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three thousand years there have been more years when we did n't live in ghettos than when we did . " David took up the argument . " Yes , and the years when we lived in ghettos and observed what you call those superstitions and petty laws were the very years when we held on to our highest moral standards . The world around us was beset with bloody wars , but in the orthodoxy of the ghetto there was peace . " " You sentimentalize that life , David . These are different times . I would rather remember the free learned Jews of Spain than the imprisoned Jew of the Polish ghetto , in spite of all his piety and virtue . " " Perhaps , " Rosa said , " if you had ever seen our services in Charleston , David , you would ? " " I know about them . You 've simply thrown out the very structure that for centuries has held the family and the whole people together . That 's what you 've done . " " Not at all ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carrying a drink , stopped at their table . " What ? What kind of a conversation is this ? Young people , you ought to be dancing . You 're all too serious . " " Oh , " David said lightly , " I 'm sure there are plenty of conversations about the stock market going on in the house right this minute . Is n't that serious , too , Papa ? Or horse racing at Metairie ? You can lose a fortune there , and surely losing money is a serious matter ! " " Or poker , or faro . Yes , yes , you 're right , " Ferdinand replied , only  | half hearing . And he progressed to the next group , doing his duty as a host . A moment later Eugene came into the room . By the speed of his walk it was evident that he was on a search . When he saw them , he stopped . " I 'm looking for Judge Ballantine . I daresay he has n't come yet . You look very comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Gabriel said . Can he really like Eugene ? Miriam wondered as Eugene sat down . And suddenly remembering He can not take his eyes from you , she wanted to get up , but was imprisoned now between her husband and Gabriel Carvaiho . The latter now resumed the interrupted discussion . " Resistance to the new is understandable , of course . When Moses Mendelssohn translated the Torah into German , how the Orthodox attacked him ! They forgot how sixteen centuries earlier the sages had translated it into Arabic and Greek . No , David , it is some measure of reform that will save Judaism for many who would otherwise abandon it . " " The way it 's been saved here in New Orleans ? What have you got ? Shops open on the Sabbath , synagogues three quarters empty ... " " But we have n't modernized yet here . That 's my point ! What we have here is just a handful of Orthodox leaning a trifle in the direction of change . And the rest of the people are nothing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Do n't be too hard on your father . " Gabriel spoke quietly . " He has no choice here , as I 've just said . And he wo n't accept the old ways anymore . The old ways remind men like him of Europe . What does he remember ? Suffering and brutality . Humiliation and ? " David interrupted . " You 're more tolerant than I. " If only David would learn not to interrupt so rudely , Miriam thought . Forgetting her embarrassment in his presence , she wanted to hear what Gabriel had to say . " More tolerant of everything around you , " David said emphatically . Something compelled Miriam to speak . Part boldly , part shyly , her words came forth . Without looking directly at him , she was addressing Gabriel . " Things do n't seem to have changed much since Josephus wrote . The problems were the same almost two thousand years ago . " " My wife is a reader , " Eugene said . He was angry that she had spoken . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversial subject . One never knew which potentially useful person one might offend .  | " There 's my son , " he said abruptly . Children and nursemaids were passing through the hall . On seeing his father , little Eugene came running . The father took the boy on his lap . " What 's this , what 's this on your arm ? " " It 's a bee sting . Blaise put mud on it . " " A bee sting ? This time of year ? It happened just now ? " " It happened yesterday , " Miriam said . " You did n't tell me ! " " It did n't seem that important . " " Well , well , since it 's all right  --  but I should be told . " And , as if doubting the wholeness of the boy , Eugene carefully examined his face , his neck , and his fat knees . For a moment conversation stopped . All were expected to give their attention to little Eugene . And he was a handsome child in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sprig of heather , all a la mode . Eugene had ordered the outfit from Scotland . " Soon you will be going to school , " he said , dandling his son . " You 're sending him to France ? " inquired Rosa . " Oh , not yet , but when he 's older , of course . " No , Miriam thought fiercely , you will not do that to me . And although she knew the answer perfectly well , she pursued the question . " What about Angelique ? Shall you send her to France , too ? " Eugene shrugged . " If you wish , but it 's not essential . " She had not spoken to him so directly for a long time , if ever . But now she was driven by the sight of him holding her child , as if he alone were responsible for Eugene . " Oh , I know it 's thought that a woman needs no education , " she said in a low , rapid voice . " Education will only make her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what 's said . " She stopped . It was no use . Eugene put down the boy , who scurried away , then turned to David . " Tell me , is it from you that my wife gets these unusual tastes ? " " Not at all . Miriam has her own tastes . " " These discussions lead nowhere . " Eugene stood up . His tone touched the edge of mockery , as if he were saying : What do ideas matter anyway ? We all know they do n't . " Down with discussions , then , " David said . The group dispersed and Miriam found herself enclosed with Gabriel behind a wall of people .  | " Your brother and I have our differences , as you see . I like to think they keep our friendship lively . " " Your differences are very small , I think . You do n't disagree on principles . And they 're really all that matter , are n't they ? " " Do come , they 're making a toast ! " someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement toward the dining room . " So you have been reading Josephus , " Gabriel said , hurrying beside her . " Over my husband 's objections . " He did not comment . Instead he asked gently , " How is the dog getting on ? " " Oh , he has got his land legs . You were so kind , I do n't know whether I thanked you enough . " " You did , " he said . He had brought the dog , complete with a basket and blanket , one Sunday afternoon . Rosa had put a red bow on its head ; the wobbling bow had fallen over one eye , so that the little thing had seemed to be winking . Miriam had laughed with delight . " Gretel the Second ! She 's almost exactly the same ! It 's so good of you , Gabriel , such a beautiful surprise ! " " Very thoughtful , " Eugene had added . " I daresay if you 'd brought her a basket of diamonds she would n't have been as pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the event , saying no more , but watching as he was doing right now , with a gaze so intense , so serious , that in her confusion she could only pretend to fix the clasp of her bracelet , which did not need to be fixed . Earnestly , as if to draw her attention away from the bracelet , he said , " I had planned to replace your Gretel as long ago as last winter . It took too many months to make the arrangements . " He ca n't take his eyes away from you , Eugene had said . In the dining room a bald gentleman with raised glass was saying something about blessings on the young couple , on the friends , on the house , on everything . Ferdinand spoke jovially into Miriam 's ear . " You see what a brotherly spirit we have ? All for one and one for all . " He was not a drinking man and he had already had two glasses of champagne . " This party must be costing a fortune , " someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice of Sylvain , who was hidden behind a pair of broad shoulders . " It 's rumored that Raphael 's overextended himself most awfully . Of course , it may be only a rumor . I  | hope so for the sake of my mother-in-law , " And as the broad shoulders moved away , he caught sight of Miriam . " Ah , Miriam , I want to introduce the bridegroom . You must meet Andre . Everyone admires him . " " I have met him , " she objected , but had already been drawn away by Sylvain 's arm to a group around another small table upon which a single supper plate had been laid . There sat old Lambert Labouisse , enthroned and erect ; his expression under a crown of immaculate white hair was severely regal . A discussion of politics had apparently been going on around him . " My son , Alexandre , is five years old , " said Sylvain , at once joining in , " and I predict that he will grow up to fight in a war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soberly . " In Congress they are already ranting about the sin of slavery , ' " Sylvain continued . " John Slidell  --  a very good friend of mine-comes back from Washington with warnings of the sentiments in the Senate . " " Do you not think it 's significant , " asked the elder Labouisse , " that some of our most brilliant defenders in the Senate are not southern born ? Slidell is from New York and , of course , Soule is from France . Remarkable , " he mused , and the others inclined their heads respectfully as though the old man had himself said something remarkable . " Soule is coming here tonight , I 've been told . I 've not seen him yet . In my opinion this talk of war is exaggerated , Our civilization will not be undermined by a handful of fanatics , " he concluded scornfully . Startled , Miriam heard a whisper and turned to look into the face of Andre Perrin . " Excuse me . Would I be depriving you of this discussion or might you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance , " she said , rising . Suddenly the talk had become too heavy . It was important talk , but she had had enough of it ; guiltily she understood this was because she was too absorbed with herself " Such heavy talk on a night like this , " said Andre Perrin as if she had spoken her thought aloud . In the courtyard , where dancing couples were moving in concentric circles , he drew her into the outer one . At once they fell into step . " I have just come back from the war in Mexico , " he told her . " I do n't want to hear any more threats of war . People think it 's all parades and flags . But you enjoyed old Rough-and-Ready 's victory parade , I hope ? He was quite a sight , riding Old Whitey . " " Oh , yes , it was splendid . "  | " Your little boy was thrilled with it , anyway . You 're wondering how I knew he was there ? I saw you . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are n't they ? " " Yes , but they say forty thousand people were in the Place d'Armes . How could you have seen me ? " Perrin enjoyed her surprise . " Because when we stood at attention opposite the cathedral , I recognized Pelagie in the front row . You were next to her . You wore a gray velvet bonnet with a white plume . Your boy wanted to pull away from your hand and run with the soldiers . You had to hold him back . " " Incredible ! What a memory you have . " " As a matter of fact , my memory is not all that good . But I remembered you . " He was not much taller than she , so that she could look almost directly into his face . His skin was ruddy brown from wind and sun . He was so close that she could see the blond roots of his eyelashes . " You think I 'm too bold , Mrs. Mendes ? I do n't mean to be . " " It 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward silence she could think of nothing better to add than " It was a stirring parade . " " It was a stirring war . All the way from Matamoros , where we landed , to Monterrey . " " But such terrible suffering ! The heat and the flits we kept reading the dispatches in the Picayune . Surely you must want to forget it all . " " I should like to . " He laughed . " My mother wo n't let me , though . She has renamed our plantation Palo Alto , ' after the battle in which I was almost wounded . She wants to think I was a hero , which I was n't . " Miriam liked the way he could laugh at himself , liked the easy grace of the dance , liked the way she was feeling . Swaying and swinging , they drew an arabesque around the courtyard . The light played on his face whenever they passed beneath a lantern . His mouth was beautifully molded , and even when he was not smiling , the curve of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine , she thought . " Shall you be living at Palo Alto ? " she asked , and remembered at once what Pelagie had said about going abroad . " No , we 're going to France for a while . But we 're having a house built here in town for when we come back . It 's in the Garden District with the Americans . " " So you 're deserting us in the Vieux Carrel " " Oh , we are all getting mixed up together these days . The old rivalry 's dying , it 's practically dead . Look at us here tonight . Everyone  | of us speaks both languages . The Creoles themselves are moving , spreading all over the city . It 's a wonderful city . I shall love working here . " " You 're an attorney ? " " A notary . Of course , we 're all mixed up here between the Code Napoleon and the English common law . But you probably know all that already . Or else you are n't interested and do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But I am very interested , " she said brightly , making her eyes larger and at the same time thinking , This is just common flirting . The waltz crashed and whirled . Marie Claire flew past in the arms of the French consul . " How happy she must be ! " Miriam cried . " Who must ? " " Why , your Marie Claire , of course . " " Dancing with the Frenchman ? Oh , she is in love with France , with anything French . " " So you are to live in France . " " Only for a year or two . We shall be here first for a while , though , at the St. Charles Hotel . " The St. Charles Hotel . A suite with a balcony . Cream . colored roses , large as cabbages . A bed . White linens and a blue silk quilt . A bed . With this man . His right hand lay between her shoulder blades , not pressing , but so firmly placed that its heat , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rippled down to the small of her back . She was not used to being touched that way , with such natural familiarity . It came to her mind that she had never been touched with any tenderness at all not even as a small child . There had been no one to do it . And now she was only aware of that hand as it moved an inch or two from side to side over her naked back . All the blood in her body seemed to be pouring into the place where that hand rested . She wanted him to move her nearer to himself , to obliterate the empty air between them . At the same time she was horrified by her desire . This total stranger ! It was absolutely mad ! How queer it would be if a person were ever able to look through the flesh and the forehead 's white bone to know what another was thinking ! It would be like walking naked down the street , as sometimes one does in those frantic dreams where one seeks a place to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time her feet were moving to the music . He was saying something to her . He had pulled a little away , to see her more clearly . She thought she had heard his question , but was not sure , and he had to repeat it . " Why are you so unhappy ? " The most burning tears came at once . Her lips quivered . He had seen through her skull . " Do n't look at me , " she said . " Please do n't , or I shall cry here in front of everyone . Please . " He was shocked . " Forgive me . Oh , my God , I do n't know why I said that ! Forgive me . " Like wheels revolving to a stop , the music slowed and Perrin danced them into the house . In a tall mirror she saw that he had indeed turned his head away . He understood , then , that when you stare at a woman 's tears , you make them flow harder . He brought her to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . I have made a fool of myself , she thought . " So you were dancing with Perrin . Good . I want you to cultivate them , " Eugene said . " Invite them often ; they 'll be living at a hotel for the next few months and they 'll be glad to come . Marie Claire 's a friend of yours anyway . " She said faintly , " We 've never been close , I hardly know her . " " What difference does that make ? It 's a contact that I want to encourage . He has connections all over the country and in Europe . Everywhere . " Without knowing why , she was terribly afraid . Her control was ebbing . She had no hold on things , and she did not want to see Andre Perrin again . By midnight the party was ending . Coachmen and footmen who had been playing marbles under the streetlamps now mounted the boxes and the carriages departed , leaving the quiet street under a murky sky . " Let 's walk , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves crackled dryly under their feet . There was a silence between them , carried over from the bickering of the early evening . When they passed the cathedral , soon to be rebuilt , Gabriel broke the silence . " These distinctions between us mean very little in the end , David . It 's the principles of the faith that matter . " Saying so , Gabriel remembered that Miriam had used those very words only a few hours before .  | " Principles ! You talk of making changes in our form of worship , but you do n't change the very society in which we live . All this piety , and still the leaders of our Jewish community , the honored and respected , own slaves ! " " I do not own slaves , " Gabriel retorted . " You live with your sister who does . And you are silent about it . " Gabriel said coldly , " I would advise more silence on your part . Right now , in fact . " As if to emphasize his meaning , a cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . You 're right , " David said suddenly . " I do n't know why it is , but I always manage to turn the conversation around to the one thing that stands between us . " He glanced at his friend , whose profile under the streetlamps stood out with the aquiline gravity of a face on an ancient coin . " The truth is , Gabriel , I 'm irritable , I 'm worried , I 'm not feeling good about anything . My sister worries me terribly . She 's miserable . You saw that tonight . " " I know . " David sighed . " A child , married off before she knows what living is all about , if one ever does know . Listen , " he said , grasping Gabriel 's elbow . " I should n't ask and I 'm not asking for anything about your client that I 've no right to know . But is there anything you can tell me about my brother-in-law that I should know ? " Gabriel considered . All he could say about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , that he paid his bills and was truthful in his dealings . He said only , " Mendes will never do anything that does n't befit his position in the community . He will follow the rules . He will maintain his house and family . He will be generous , but never extravagant . " Gabriel gave up . " The truth is , I do n't know anything more than you do . " And again he saw Miriam 's Mideastern eyes , so passionate and mournful , eyes of Rebecca and Rachel , out of the biblical age . " Have you ever thought , " David asked suddenly , " that there is a kind of slavery for women , too ? It seems to me it must be very hard to be a woman . " " Yes , I 've thought so , " Gabriel said . They walked together as far as David 's house , where they parted and Gabriel went on alone . The fog , lifting , revealed a vast , mysterious oyster-colored sky . Over  | the flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He walked slowly , in no hurry to reach home . When he put the key in the front door , he sensed that his sister was not yet home . Always the last to leave , she would have lingered at the party . She had a need for close companionship , a need which was lacking in himself . He wondered whether among her intimacies she had learned very much about Miriam Mendes . Probably not . And again he saw before him those passionate , suffering , lambent eyes . Enough of this , he said sternly to himself . For a moment he stood in the hall , staring at nothing , then shook himself as if he were trying to shake off a burden , and climbed the stairs .  | She lies awake in the sultry night . She lies , as she always does , at the very edge of the huge bed . The vacant hollow between her husband and herself is symbolic , she thinks ; they are now totally apart . Thus it is that he has not noticed what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , satisfied that her appearance and behavior are " correct , " has looked no deeper . It comes to her mind that possibly something is really wrong with her , some poisoning of spirit , some seeping disease . She is obsessed by Andre Perrin . He inhabits a permanent corner of her memory . His voice with its peel iiar , slightly nasal timbre , repeats in her ear his most trivial phrases . Her eye recalls the blond hairs on his wrists , revealed by a too loose cuff . She remembers the kid-gloved hand on her back . She reads a story to Angelique . Two plump , sleek curls dangle on either side of the child 's face ; the mother twists the curls , drawing the child closer to her side , thinking How sweet she is . In the same moment she is thinking of Andre Perrin . In the marketplace she feels the melons , gray cantaloupes , netted and veined in darker green ; when the ends give under the fingers , the flesh will be juicy and rosy . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counts the times she has seen him since their first meeting : Five times he has come home with Eugene for two o'clock dinner ; there have been eighteen parties here and at other people 's houses ; eight times they have met at the theater . Four times they have met on the street when he was walking with Marie Claire . Is n't it disgraceful that he should fill her mind ? She has no right to these thoughts ! He belongs to Marie Claire ! They lie together at night , he with the remote and dreary Marie Claire . They lie together ; his hands move wherever they want to move upon her body . Their arms and their mouths move wherever they want to move .  | In the same way Eugene must lie with his woman . He lies now breathing heavily into the darkness ; his heavy shoulders twitch in a dream . What if Eugene were dead ? What if Marie Claire were dead ? What might happen then ? Miriam throws the sheet back ; she is suffocating with the heat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy ? he asked me . I might have answered : Because my husband is not like you . What can you know of me ? he might have asked me then . And I should have answered : How can three bars of music tear the heart with sorrow ? How can a slow gray rain infuse the heart with delight ? You see , there is no reason for any of these things . She does not want to be alone with him ever again . Suppose some thought forms on her lips and sounds itself against her will ? And now a horror seizes her . Someday , surely , that will happen . She will put out her hand and touch his arm in a way that will tell everything , or else her voice in making some ordinary remark will betray her . In her dining room she places him far from herself at the end of the table . Yet perversely , whenever she knows they are to meet , she takes particular pains with her dress . For years she has forgotten to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself was at her first appearance at the opera , when Emma had taught her how to flutter a fan . Yet last week , buying a white straw bonnet heavy with lilacs , she wished that he might see her wearing it . Occasionally she has met his glance . She knows he must remember her tears . Perhaps he wonders why she cried , or perhaps he thinks only that she is a weak and foolish woman , a spoiled and silly woman who ought to know better . After all , your husband does not beat you , he  --  or anyone  --  might say . Your children sleep safely under the solid roof . How many women would not gladly change places with you ? First light breaks through the blinds and lies in stripes across the floor , striking the basket in the corner where Gabriel Carvalho 's dog lies still asleep , creeping across the marble tabletop where last night 's pearls lie coiled , to strike her at last full in the face , with the glare of another day .  | On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorting out his thoughts . More than ever it was his sister who troubled those thoughts . The perversity of human affairs ! That after all this time he had come back to the South , and now it was she who wanted to go north ! Only a few months before , she had told him about her fantasy  --  and fantasy it was  --  he thought now , ruefully . She had told him , on that mild winter night , so much that he had felt the burden of it ever since . On the way home from a late call , he had passed the Mendes 's darkened house and seen her sitting at a single light by the library window . He had stopped and mounted the steps . " What are you doing up so late ? And alone ? " he 'd asked . " I could n't sleep . So I came downstairs again , that 's all . " Her face was turned away , deliberately ; not wanting him to see it , she allowed her hair to swing across her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What is it ? What 's troubling you so that you ca n't sleep ? " he asked . " Nothing . Nothing . I 'm all right . " " There 's always a reason why a person ca n't sleep , you know . " " You 're being a doctor , " she murmured , still turned away . " Yes , but also your brother . " Her shoulders shook ; she was making an effort not to weep . He hesitated . They might have had a simple quarrel , just a bad day ; women were often oversensitive ; what was a tragedy tonight could easily be forgotten in morning light and morning smiles ; he might do better minding his own business . Yet something made him persist . " I wish you 'd tell me , Miriam . How will I be able to go home and sleep while all sorts of thoughts about you go pounding in my head ? "  | For a minute or two she did not answer . A shutter swung and creaked in the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her dream , and was still . The silence was stifling . And suddenly Miriam broke it . She whirled up from the chair and flung out her arms . " I want ... I want ... " She gasped . " I want to get out of here ! I despise it ! There is no freedom , not only for the Negroes , but for anyone ! There is a line , drawn so " ? she drew a line with her foot ? " and so , and over it one dares not walk . You have a position , you are Mrs. Whoever-it-may-be , and there are rules . Rule number one : Put on a good face , never let anybody know the truth about the way you live . .. " Miriam 's lips trembled . She frightened David . He stood up and grasped her hands . " What are you saying ? Is it as bad as that ? " " Yes , yes , you do n't know how I dream . . . . I have a daydream . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... we 'll run away from here , go north , into another world , and ? " " Miriam , there is no paradise in the North . True , there 's no Negro slavery , but there are other ills . People can be unhappy there , too . Is n't that just common sense ? " She pulled away and covered her eyes , swaying a little as she stood , and then , as abruptly as she had flung herself out of the chair , she came to David and laid her head on his shoulder . " I have been so unhappy ! You ca n't know .... " " I ca n't know unless you tell me , my dear . " " Why did I marry Eugene ? Why ? " she whispered . " A fatal mistake ! For him , too ! There 's nothing  --  there 's nothing there , do you understand ? There 's not one way that we belong together . Not one way ! I do n't say it 's anyone 's fault , it just happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He thought perhaps he did , but out of delicacy  --  she was , after all , his sister  --  could not say . He could only ask , helplessly , " No way at all ? Nothing that can be done ? " Miriam shook her head . " Perhaps if I . . . if someone ... were to talk to you , perhaps both of you together , and find out . . . " Find out what ? That there was no love ? Or how to put it there where there was n't any ? He did not expect a reply , and she gave none . And trying to conceal his heartache , he said , " I do n't know what you can do , but I know one thing you ca n't do . Miriam , my dear , you must  | put these thoughts of running away right out of your head , or they will fester and make things harder for you . " " I thought , " she said weakly , " if Papa would give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never give you money to leave your husband , you know that . And how would you live up North ? As a single woman , ostracized , and your children without a father ? No , Miriam , you have to be practical . " He heard himself speaking platitudes ; despising the sound of them , he still knew them to be true and necessary . He held his sister 's hands , and went on with his advice , knowing it to be more compassionate to pacify her than to encourage her despairing rebellion . " Read , educate yourself , work in your charities , tend to the children . Busyness is everything .... " And all the time , as he spoke , he wondered whether by any chance there could be an even deeper reason for her misery , another man per-haps ? Now recalling that night , he sighed . His tiredness was not physical , he knew ; it came from his nerves , vibrating like taut fence wire that sings in a strong wind . He was unable to help Miriam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of them clandestine . He feared the risks he was taking . Leaning over the railing , he let the breeze cool his flushed cheeks . The history of the South was written along these riverbanks . Here and there on a bluff , a great house stood like a proud classic temple , while in the fields below , the hoe gangs toiled . Between the great houses lay the holdings of the little farmer , a couple of acres with a log house for the family and two or three cabins for the Negroes , beside whom their owner could be seen bent over in the cotton . At this season the distant woods were all in blossom , the dogwood white as stars , the hawthorn pink , and the forsythia like melting gold . In the foreground the road followed the river . Blue innocents grew wild in trailing patches , and brown cattle lay under the trees chewing their noon cud . An English landscape artist , a Constable , would make much of the innocent rural scene , and for a moment David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead he saw the ragged yokels running to peer whenever the boat stopped at a landing with a delivery from the city . Out of wondering eyes they stared at the traveling Quality on the floating palace . He saw the poor " white trash " sitting on the lower deck among shabby boxes .  | A pregnant young woman had lost all her teeth . A child was covered with sores . And suddenly he was back on the Mirabelle . That voyage might have happened in another age , so long ago it seemed , and he so changed from the greenhorn boy ! No , not changed , except on the outside . He ran his hand over the doctor 's bag , the good brown leather bag . Only changed on the outside . In the ballroom behind him someone was playing the Moonbeam Waltz on the piano , the little tune making a thin , sweet tinkle . How pleasant to travel the river , dining with friends under crystal chandeliers or making profitable business deals over cigars and brandy , while all the time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension of the seductive city . For a man who could give himself up to them , the pleasures of that city were Elysian : food and wine , women and money and music . The French Opera 's orchestra was one of the best ? some said the best  --  in the nation . The cooking was renowned , the women resplendent . He remembered girls , half a dozen or more , and every one a treasure , laughing , flirting , or lovely in gravity ; he thought of perfumed silk and white shoulders , and coming home to a young wife . . . . But in this time and in this place he had chosen another way ; he was bound and committed to the bottom of his soul . He took further stock . Intellectually and professionally he had every reason to be content . He had been building a substantial obstetrical practice , having been among the first to use chloroform . He was a regular contributor to the New Orleans Medical Journal , having written on yellow fever and sanitation . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the business of this day could destroy forever . " You traveling far ? " A voice spoke at his elbow . The speaker , a middle-aged gentleman with a polite expression , tipped his hat . David tipped his . " Getting off at the next stop . " The stranger extended his hand . " Name 's Cromwell , George Alexander Cromwell . " " I 'm happy to meet you , sir . I 'm Dr. David Raphael . " " Practicing in New Orleans ? I believe I 've heard your name . I live in Baton Rouge . " The man seemed inclined to stay at the rail in friendly conversation , so it became necessary to make some agreeable remark . " Nice way to travel . Better than risking highwaymen on the roads , " David said . " Yes , the roads are terrible . But I always liked the river , anyway . I  | was on the Duke of Orleans when it set the record in forty-three . Six days , eleven hours between Cincinnati and New Orleans . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " If you can keep from getting caught by the gamblers . The captain set three of them ashore on that trip , I remember . They should do so more often . Too many planters are being ruined . " David nodded . Last week Eugene had mentioned something about Ferdinand 's having lost a large sum at cards on the way to the Labouisse place upriver . He had also said something about the Raphael firm being on shaky ground , which seemed hard to believe . David had thought of asking Gabriel whether there was any truth in it , but Gabriel would not have told him if there were . You could turn Gabriel upside down and never get out of him anything that you should n't . The lawyer-client relationship was sacred . David 's troubled thoughts were interrupted as the stranger exclaimed , " Of course ! I know where I heard your name . Sylvain Labouisse  --  is n't he a relative of yours ? " David smiled . " In a very roundabout way . My father 's wife is his mother-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A fine family , the Labouisses . Distinguished in the state . A long history . " " So I understand , " David said with the proper courteous interest . " As a matter of fact , I 've just come from a meeting in the city where he spoke . Getting after the abolitionist curse . I was one of the speakers , too . I introduced Henry Hyams . Are you acquainted with him ? " " I 've met him . " " A coming man . They say he 'll be governor of the state one day . A Jewish gentleman . I take it you are , too ? " " I am , sir . " " Well , let me tell you I admire a man like Hyams or Sylvain Labouisse or any man who speaks up . Fence sitters I despise . Letting other men prepare the defense of their women and children . There 's too much antislavery propaganda going about , you know . We need vigilance , just as another fine speaker said . Eugene Mendes . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have the honor to be his brother-in-law . " George Alexander Cromwell was impressed . " Well , we need more like him . I tell you , people do n't realize how serious this situation is . Ever since California wrote its constitution barring slavery , people like  | Garrison have been encouraged . Why even the churches are infected ! I 'm a Baptist and we had to secede from our national convention . " With a concerned expression David shook his head . " Yes , you have to keep your eyes and your ears open . " The other man lowered his voice . " I do n't know how true it is , but yesterday they were saying something about an Englishman named Dyson . He runs that school for free colored boys in New Orleans . They say he 's teaching a lot of others things beside the three R 's . " " You do n't mean " I do mean . Plots and uprisings , my friend . " " Dyson ! Really ! " David exclaimed . " I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him casually . He lives not far from me , but I 'd say he was just a pedagogue . Rather dull at that . He does n't look at all like the type to be doing underground work . These rumors can touch the innocent , you know . " " Oh , no doubt . But it pays to be alert all the same . You remember in thirty-seven when they broke up that insurrection in Rapides Parish ? It was highly organized . Then again in forty in Lafayette Parish . Four abolitionists down from the North had a revolt well on the way . My wife 's father 's slaves were in it but we caught them in time and hanged the lot . Oh , it pays to be alert . " " I daresay you 're right . I get so busy with patients I do n't have time for much else . " " You see patients this far out ? " Cromwell nodded toward the brown leather bag . " Rarely . Sometimes I combine a consultation with a visit to friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then . Well , I get off round the next bend . " Mr. Cromwell tipped his hat again . " Glad to have met you . " David tipped his . " The same to you , sir . " His knees were weak when he left the boat . From the little dock a dusty path led through the woods to the main road . The woods were loud with birdsong . A goat grazing along the path skittered away through the brush as David approached . Three little boys came out of a cabin some yards back to stare and retreat . Otherwise , there was no one about . He Walked on , summoning his nerve , trying to arrange his features into an expression of calm assurance . They were to meet at Bartlett 's Hotel , half a mile down the road . It was a family resort , crowded on weekends when people came to dine  | and be entertained with lawn bowling , fireworks , and balloon ascensions . For that reason he had chosen to meet in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hoped the place would not be empty , making them conspicuous and too easily remembered . I was not born to conspire , David thought . I do not have the stomach for it . A man stepped out of the bushes abreast of him . " You 're late , " Lucien said . " I was beginning to worry . " " We had one long stop , a grand piano to hoist . Is everyone here ? " " Just abort . There are two other parties , children 's birthdays . I took a private room and ordered a birthday cake . " Half a dozen carriages stood at the hotel 's entrance . A group of men were entering the bar . Good . There was activity , but not too much . " You ordered a birthday cake ? Whose birthday is it ? " " Why not yours ? " Lucien 's long , doleful face crinkled with amusement . " Fine . But you should brush your uniform . You do n't look like a fitting servant for an up-and-coming young doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll take care of it . Also , I 've an extra horse . You 'll go back by road by dark . Later tonight some people will come to the city to collect the circulars . One will come to the office and bring them to the others at a place I have arranged . " David stood still . " Who 's coming ? " he asked sharply . " A friend of mine . You do n't know him . " " A Negro ? " " Who else ? " Lucien threw his hands out , palms up . " What other friend would I have ? " " But you 're crazy ! A Negro coming to my office at night ! Could anything be more conspicuous ? " " He 'll be a patient , a free man of color . He has a right to come to a doctor . He 'll have a sore arm , or maybe an injured eye would be better . " " All right , then . " As they entered the lobby , David raised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take their drink orders , they 'll be thirsty . And hurry up . " " Yes , sir . Right away , sir . " In the private dining room a small group was already waiting . Except for two traveling men from Massachusetts , they were all familiar . James MacKenzie was a printer who still kept his Scottish burr after fifteen years in America . Randolph Blair , rebellious and elegant , was the son  | of a Virginia planter . Ludwig Schiff , small and fussy , came from a German-Jewish family in Memphis . In a corner sat a nondescript individual with a meek demeanor , the very sort who chooses a corner to sit in . David went straight to him , extending his hands . " Mr. Dyson ! " he said . " Mr. Dyson ! Welcome . " Late in the afternoon they were still at table . Leaning across the remains of the cheerful feast , they spoke in voices hardly above a whisper . " Well , I think we can say we 've made some progress today , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . " Any of you , each of you , take whatever you need . There will be more next time . The money is coining in so nicely , so easily . " " Not easily , " David corrected . " Give yourself credit , Schiff . You work at it . " MacKenzie said , " I would n't take so much if I did n't need more money to buy paper . I 've also had to get a small press . " " Take the money , " Schiff commanded . The two northerners persisted . " We 've spent the last hour discussing flyers and leaflets . What about guns ? " Young Blair , leaning back from the table , stretched his long legs . " I 've told you . On your next trip you will send me a carton of books . Be sure there really are books on the top . Clarissa is the name of my sister 's place . I 'm staying the year out , so you can deliver them any time . Naturally , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part that stops me , " David said . " I have no liking for guns , as you all know . " The Yankee answered dryly , " No one here has a liking for them . But you have to be realistic . We shall use them as little as possible . But we have to have them . " " All right , then . When shall you send them ? " " There 's no hurry , " Dyson said cautiously . " We 're not nearly ready . We must have no slapdash affair that fails . Ten hangings and it 's all over . " Schiff was impatient . " How long do you expect to wait ? It 's been long enough already . " " As long as it takes to be prepared , " Dyson replied . " Another year or  | two , probably . We must have plenty of support in the countryside . That takes time . " " There 's where you come in . " David nodded to MacKenzie . " Keep the printing presses rolling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have pamphlets at the door of every country church , white churches  --  not the Negro , since the Negroes ca n't read . But there is great support to be mustered among poor whites . It is only a question of reaching them with the right message . " MacKenzie nodded . " I have a lot ready for tonight . It 's stashed in your yard . " David got up and opened the door . The corridor was clear except for Lucien standing just outside . David beckoned him to come in . " You could n't hear our voices ? Are you sure ? " " Nothing . Only when you sang . " " Good ! It sounded like a real party , then ? " " Like a real party . " " All right . Now let 's get this straight . We will all separate . I shall ride back alone . MacKenzie has material at my office ? " " In the yard , under the cistern . " " And someone will come tonight for it . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandana covering the bandage to keep it clean , " Lucien recited . " He will put the flyers in a sack of melons in his wagon . If he is stopped , he will simply be carrying melons to market , or peddling them as the case may be . But there 's no reason why he should be stopped . " " Suppose , though , that the worst happens and they do stop him ? " Schiff asked . " This man is like my brother , " Lucien answered gravely . " He will kill himself or allow himself to be killed , but he will not endanger me . " These somber words caused a moment 's silence in the room . " You know , " David said , " I really do n't see why we ca n't have all the men come right to my place to collect , instead of having all these hiding places you and MacKenzie have worked out . I 'm beginning to think I 've been too cautious . " " No , no , Doctor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are . It is enough that I risk myself by being open with my pupils . We ca n't risk you , too . " " Nonsense , " David said . " If these people ca n't be trusted , what are we doing with them in the first place ? " " Trusted . " Lucien 's melancholy eyes went past them all , out past the  | window onto the dusky blue lawn . " You do n't know what a man will say with his feet held into a fire or when he 's buried up to the neck and the fire ants crawl into his eyes . " " Enough . " David shuddered . " Enough . "  | In the middle of the afternoon , that flat windless hour when the day is no longer fresh and dusk lies like a dirty powder on the leaves , Miriam put Lelia aside on the garden bench . All that passion and strife , all that radical defiance ! It wearied the mind . It was impossible to compare a woman like George Sand with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind go blank . At the side-street gate , which was rarely used , someone lifted the creaking latch . Lazily , only half rising , she turned to see who was there . " I thought you might be here , " Andre Perrin said . She felt a chill fear of imminent crisis , a fluttering between heart and throat . " I am often here in the afternoon , " she answered coldly . He sat down on the other bench . She wanted to get up and run into the house . " I was passing , " he said , " and since we are finally going away next week  --  you know we are leaving for France on the Mirabelle ? " " That 's the ship that brought me here , years ago . " " How strange ! Well , I only  --  I wanted to say good-bye . " " I hope you have a good voyage and will be happy in France . " The stilted words fell dully into the oppressive air . " Thank you . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now with his left hand he began to run a forefinger over the brim . Round and round it passed as she watched . In her own fingertips she could feel the smooth straw edge . Something in this trivial motion was asking for time , as if he were collecting himself for something else . His lowered head as he examined the hat looked helpless . She did not understand what was happening .  | Suddenly he looked up . " Yes , I came to say good-bye . But before I go , I wanted , I had to- " He got up . He stood over her . The tips of his boots stopped within an inch of her skirt 's hem , which lay on the grass . " For months , for this whole year past , I 've been trying not to say it . I 'm ashamed , Miriam . Ashamed and afraid of what you will do . You may never forgive me . And I would n't blame you . " The words came rushing . " I have been thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what it means . Do I love you ? I scarcely know you . Yet you fill my mind all day . Every day . You fill my mind . " She fastened her eyes on a hummingbird whose long beak was sucking deeply from a creamy flower on the trumpet vine . No larger than a grasshopper and as green , it flickered . Its iridescent wings were beating the air too fast for the human eye to see , and she held her gaze to the bird . " Are you very angry ? " he whispered . She could not speak . She was afraid to speak . Perhaps , as she had feared it might happen , this at last was the moment of transition from reality to fantasy ; speech would betray her and everyone would know . She had gone mad . " When I started to speak just now , " she said , " I thought in the very same moment that I must be crazy , and I wanted to stop , but it 's already too late . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at him , forcing her mind into reality . His eyes were anxious , questioning , soft . His hand went out to touch most tentatively her own hand , which lay in her lap with the fingers weakly upturned . Then she felt her lips opening into a smile , felt her own warm tears . " Oh , " he said , " is it possible ? You never spoke to me . I thought I had displeased you so terribly . You never spoke to me . " " I was afraid you would see , " she said very low . " I was afraid you would know . " His hand tightened on hers , the fingers intertwined . " Oh , God , " he said . Unashamed , she raised her face , letting him see the teardrops slide down her cheeks . " I thought of so many ways to meet you alone . Always it was at those dreadful dinners . I tried avoiding you . When I made plans , they came to nothing . I thought of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you , you know . "  | " You ca n't know , " she interrupted . " I know enough . Do you understand that I was afraid  --  am afraid ? to begin this thing ? Yet I ca n't help it , ca n't go away without speaking to you , and still it 's of no use , my speaking , is it ? " And taking her other hand , he lifted it to his lips to kiss it . Her wedding ring , a wide band strong as a rope and solid as a stone wall , brushed his lips . He looked about desperately . " There 's no time , no place , and so much to say . " Above the splashing double cascade the little love goddess looked with her indifferent chalk-white gaze at the agitated lovers . " You married Marie Claire . " " We were guests at the same house for three weeks . At the end of the time we found ourselves engaged . I do n't know how it happened . I think our mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I was . " " Who does these things to us ? " Miriam cried . " Why do we allow them to happen ? Eugene and I ? we 're all wrong for each other . " And she withdrew her hands , clasping them in a kind of supplication . All the long sorrow , the senseless injustice , and now this intoxication overwhelmed her . Andre took her face in his hands , turning it into the glaring light . Fearlessly she let him examine it ; whatever flaw was there , he must see and accept , the eyebrows too close together , a little white scar on the chin , any and every flaw . Then his mouth came down on hers , the lips fitting together as though they had been molded that way , so pliant , so perfect ... Her arms went up to pull him closer . A door slammed in the house and they sprang apart . They waited , but no one came . " There 's no place to go , " Andre said again . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France . " " I 'll be back . " " When ? How long ? " " I 'm not sure . Perhaps only a year . " " Only a year . And then ? " " There 'll have to be something , some way . I do n't know . " " I do n't know , either . " A flock of pigeons came swooping over the wall , attacking the crumbs the children must have dropped on the gravel path . They surrounded the bench just as on crowded Sunday afternoons in the public  | parks they always surround young lovers who seek in vain for a private place . And suddenly , not caring who might see , knowing how mad this defiance was , Miriam drew him back to her , kissing his forehead , his cheeks , and his mouth over and over , making little cries ; then her head went to his shoulder and he stroked her hair , murmuring . All she felt was a need to press closer and never stop , never She heard her son 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you out here ? " She sprang up , calling , " Yes , I 'm here , darling . " The child came around the shrubbery . His cheeks were flushed from his nap ; his hair , freshly parted , still held the babyish curl around his neck . Helpless , tender . . . What am I doing ? she thought , in sudden fright . But she said brightly , too brightly , in a shaking voice , " Eugene , you remember Mr. Perrin . He is going to Europe . He has come to say goodbye to us all . " " I 'm going to go to Europe , too , " the boy said confidently . " I 'm sure you will someday , " Andre told him . Over the child 's head he looked at Miriam . His eyelashes fell like curtains , then rose on a look of despair which plainly said : We ca n't end this , I ca n't leave you like this . She was cut in two . The halves were straining apart , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and the child , felt them pulling her , each one with all his strength , yet neither was touching her . Piteously she appealed to her son . " Will you go inside to play , Eugene ? Just for a little while , please . Then I 'll come to be with you . " " But I 've been inside ! It 's half past three and Fanny said you promised to read to Angie and me . " The shrill voice ended in a wail . Now Angelique came from the house with Fanny . " Here we are , Miss Miriam , " Fanny said . " It 's half past three . " They were not to be dislodged . Miriam gave a hopeless shake of the head . And Andre , having no choice , picked up his hat . " Shall you be coming again to say good-bye to Eugene ? " The words were formal , but the voice implored . He shook his head . " I ca n't , " he said miserably . And he stood there already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " I ca n't , " he repeated , as if to say , The next time will be unbearable . She understood . " Well , " she said , " I suppose you 'll write to us ? " " I am not very good at writing , I 'm afraid . "  | She understood that , too . A proper , stiff letter would be the only permissible one , and that would be worse than none at all . " Mama , read ! " demanded Angelique , screwing up her eyes . " I 'll go , " Andre said . " Remember me to the rest of the family . " Her face burned ; her hands were cold . " I 'll remember , " she said , and turned away . So she did not see him go , only heard his footsteps on gravel and the click of the gate . " Mama , shall we get the books ? " " Yes , get them , do . Go upstairs and get them . " And she sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still pecking at Aphrodite 's feet . A ladybug in its spotted red shell alighted on the back of the bench . A wren took a bath in a dusty puddle . Heedless little creatures , crawling and flying , foraging for their simple sustenance from one day 's end to the next ! Only man had such longing , such confusion in his heart . To have been given in one incredible moment one 's heart 's impossible desire ! To have been given it , and then to have it as quickly taken away ! Lelia had fallen to the ground . She picked it up , riffling the pages . A life like that might befit George Sand , that fearless , extraordinary soul . But Miriam Mendes was not George Sand . She was neither fearless nor extraordinary . And this was America , not Paris . Take the children and go north , putting everything , even Andre behind her ? For what good could ever come to them ? Let him return here and not find her ! It would be better that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and she would , too , men and women being what they are . She had seen and read enough of life to know that much . She would have to ask Papa for the money to go away , since she had , of course , none of her own . Her dowry was the possession of her husband . A woman had always to ask . Nothing was hers by right . Ask Papa ? she repeated . He would be horrified ; she could see him slowly removing the cigar ; his mouth would make a circle of dismay . She could hear his admonition : Go back to your husband ; remember that you 're a mother ; you have responsibilities and a position to keep . " Here 's the book , " said Angie , placing it on her mother 's lap . The beloved fairy tales had been read so often that the pages were beginning to fall out . Unerringly , the stubby little finger went to the favorite picture , the favorite tale . Miriam moved the book to make room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment she laid her cheek against Angie 's warm fragrant hair .  | She was almost choked by her surging love for the child and by the crisis of the last hour . " I always like this story because it has a happy ending , Mama . " " Ah , yes , that 's a very good reason , " Miriam replied . And in a clear , controlled voice , time began to read . " Once upon a time . . , ' " Often from the glass in the bedroom a hopeless face stared back at her , a pinched face with dry lips . The dark hair , loosened for the night , gave her a wild look of desperation . The old fear of madness returned . Perhaps some night she would smash the mirror , letting the shards fly . Her lungs would strain from a scream of outrage ; then the wind would carry her scream through the walls of the house over the ocean , and into the racing currents of the upper air , as far as Europe , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of some pride to Ferdinand Raphael that he had weathered the long-ago panic of 1837 . The English cotton market had fallen like a stone , and like a stone tossed into a pond , the panic had rippled across the ocean to engulf New Orleans in a wave of failures . Banks defaulted their bonds , credit was withdrawn , and some of the most prestigious business houses in the city fell into ruin . But the House of Raphael had come through unscathed , one of the very few which had survived . Somehow Ferdinand had maneuvered his way around all the hidden reefs and dangerous currents of the times ; he had even been able to come to the aid of friends . " Experience , " he liked to say by way of explanation . " Caution . And a bit of daring , too . Yes , certainly a bit of daring . " And his youthful smile would brighten his cheeks up to the temples . So it was with a shock of sudden thunder that the House of Raphael collapsed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ships laden with cotton and sugar crowded the port again and wealth from the seven seas flowed in . Christmas week was being celebrated with eggnog , poinsettias , and cathedral bells . The Raphael house was filled . Emma 's aunts and uncles from Shreveport and her cousins from Mobile , with their nursemaids and children , filled the guestrooms , while the overflow was housed at the St. Louis Hotel . " We shall have to take the children to visit for Christmas , " Miriam said . " They know quite well it 's not their holiday , but Papa has presents for them and it would be cruel to refuse . " " Very well , then , you take them , " Eugene said as she had known he would . The opulence of the Raphael house that year was dazzling . Christmas roses drooped their luscious heads in every room . Handsome gifts were  | given and received : Persian shawls , gold chains , Belgian lace , cashmere dresses , and Meissen porcelains . A new star sapphire glittered on Emma 's hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the last explosion always being the loudest and the highest , the boom deafening and the stars shooting far over the trees , only to blaze and fall into a little heap of cinders . She had walked home through holiday streets with the children . It was a slow walk . They had to stop to peer at every lighted tree , to admire every wreathed and garlanded door . The children , entranced with the music and color of Christmas , could not help but enfold their mother in their delight . So in high spirits they reached home . " Look ! " cried little Eugene . " See what Grandpa gave me . " With Miriam 's help he brought in a heavy music box on which carved horses rode a carousel . " He gave Mama a new bracelet , and Angelique a ? " Eugene laid the newspaper down . " Allow me to say that your father is a spendthrift and a fool . " Unwilling to reveal her own unquiet doubts , Miriam defended him . " He 's a wealthy man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Generous he is , but he is not wealthy anymore . His house of cards is about to collapse . " " What do you mean ? " she cried . " That he will be going through bankruptcy very soon . " " I do n't believe it ! " " You can believe it . Rumors have been all over the city for weeks . He 's been reorganizing his companies to stave it off , but it 's too late , it wo n't help . " Miriam put her hand to her mouth in horror . " I do n't believe it ! " Shortly before noon on the second day of the new year , the Bank of New Orleans called its loans to the House of Raphael . Whisper to whisper at first , then louder and surer , from the tables at Victor 's to the wharves , the news was spread . By evening there was not a house in the Vieux Carre which did not know of the disaster . For once unaccompanied by guests , Eugene came home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " this is what happens when a man gets to thinking he 's infallible . " His tone was somewhere between commiseration and superiority . Miriam sat on the sofa . They were in the front parlor , the stiff , gilded room . Her voice was harsh with pain . " What happened ? Why did it happen ? "  | " He was gullible , for one thing . He endorsed bad notes for his socalled friends . Wanted to be liked , I suppose . A common enough story . And for another , he simply spent too much . And for a third , he speculated , building pyramids like Pharaoh . Only Pharaoh 's lasted longer . " " Pyramids ? I do n't understand . " " Mortgaging your properties to get money to buy more property . Take the cornerstone out and the pyramid falls . You see ? " Standing against the daylight , Eugene was a powerful dark presence . One hand jingled coins in his pocket . The gesture spoke of easy assurance . This sort of thing will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no mortgages on any of my properties , nor did I ever speculate in cotton futures . Why do you think Judah Touro came through the panic unscathed ? Because he was prudent . " " You mean Papa has nothing at all ? " " What do you think bankruptcy is ? No , there is nothing left . Not of his , nor of Emma 's either . " " Of Emma 's ? " " He had enlarged Emma 's plantation , bought three thousand acres adjoining it by mortgaging the original land . " A bunch of keys in the other pocket now made their separate jingle . " Next comes the sheriff 's sale : the schooner , the office and warehouses , all the baled cotton waiting for shipment , the slaves , the house on Conti Street ? " " Not Papa 's beautiful house ! " Now pity came into his voice , as if suddenly he had seen that she was crushed . " Yes , it will go , I 'm sorry to say . " She stood up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll go with you , " Eugene said immediately . She did n't want him  --  with all that power and competence . " You do n't have to . I 'll go alone . " " It 's my place , " he said firmly . " I 'm his son-in-law . " Yes , she thought as she followed him , it 's your place . There are people who go to funerals because it 's their place , but really it 's to congratulate themselves on being alive . In his front parlor Ferdinand was reading a newspaper . Over his head hung a portrait of young Emma in her Empire gown , with her bouquet and the affable gaze of a person who has never known any trouble . He had been reading the Deutsche Zeitung which , wanting so much to be American that he was ashamed to be seen with a German newspaper , he had always read in secret . He made no attempt to hide it now .  | " Well , Papa , " Miriam said , kissing him . Stroking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple throb under her fingers . He murmured something and she drew away , pitying his embarrassment , should he be seen with tears in his eyes . But he was not weeping . Instead he wore a look of surprise , as if to say : I do not  --  no , I do not understand how this could have happened to me . To me ! After the swift , steady rise , his daughter thought , straining with every bit of energy , tensed to the fullest , after all that skillful juggling and maneuvering through the first hard years , and finally the lovely lavish years  --  to end like this ? " Let 's talk about facts , " Eugene said , taking command . " Get pens and paper . " Hastily , Ferdinand obeyed , and the two men bent their heads over a sheaf of documents on the desk . This was man 's work . Miriam scarcely understood the meaning of words like mortgage , demand note , or bond . Half hearing them , she could only remember irrelevant things : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. Barnum 's circus and bought them balloons . Presently Ferdinand looked up . " Will you go see Emma ? " he asked . " Poor Emma . She 's upstairs in her sitting room with Pelagie and Eulahe . " On her lit de repos , leaning against a mound of ruffled pillows , Emma lay mourning , while her maid applied eau de cologne to her flushed forehead . " My land ! My beautiful land ! How can it be ? Yesterday it was there , all those acres ! And the finest staircase in the state , did you know that ? A free-standing staircase . Yesterday it was mine and now they tell me ? they tell me ? " Poor Emma ! Such bitter tragedy for her to whom " position in society " meant , next to her family , all there was of value in the world . " And two hundred slaves ! " A falling tear made a wet spot on Emma 's blue sleeve . " People who served my parents and my grandmother ! What is to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Yet she had not one word of blame for Ferdinand . " Those wicked bankers ! " she cried . " All the friends he helped , the people we entertained , where are they ? It 's their fault , bringing a good man down to ruin . " " Nonsense , Mama , " Eulahe interjected . " It 's nobody 's fault but your husband 's , your greedy , gambling , spendthrift husband . But then , you might have known , Jews are always ? "  | Pelagie whirled upon her sister . " What can you be saying ? Was he the only one ? Half the city was ruined in the panic only a few years ago . Half the city spends more than it owns , gambles on the horses , on cards , on anything it can . And you talk of a Jewish vice ! " For a moment Miriam 's outrage tied her tongue . A moment later , in the face of Pelagie 's decency , the anger ebbed . And again she saw Eulalie clearly : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was her male protector , the only one she had , and he has failed her . Yes , and failed me , too . Now I am condemned to stay with Eugene . And Miriam caught herself wringing her hands in a helpless gesture which she had made without thinking , and which she despised . Downstairs on the verandah the Christmas roses were turning a mournful purple , dropping their petals to the floor . In the courtyard under the pallid winter sun it was quite still , with neither clatter nor chatter heard from the quarters . The news had reached the servants , then , and they feared what might happen to them . A pall had fallen on the house . On the bottom step she stood just looking . She saw her father on her wedding evening , expansive with pride in his daughter and his house . She saw herself sitting in the arbor struggling to read French , then later , entering her childish thoughts in the white satin book . There came Gretel , the first Gretel , turning , tamping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mulberry bush . There much later , on another night , she had danced  --  danced with the husband of Marie Claire . Why are you so unhappy ? he 'd asked . Fool ! Fool ! Still thinking of him when nothing will ever come of it . Nothing . Eugene came down the steps behind her . " I thought you were up with Emma . " " I was . But Enlalie was too much for me . She blames it all on Papa 's being Jewish . " " Stupid old maid . Nasty old maid , " Eugene said savagely . " Had you known that about her before ? " " Oh , there 've always been little things here and there , mostly things unsaid . " " They all took from him . How they all took from him ! Of course , the wreck is his own doing , but they helped it along . I always said he had no right to support her extravagant relatives . What a reversal now ! And he too old to start again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first David 's and then Gabriel 's . David was asking , " Is it really as bad as it looks ? " " Every bit and perhaps even worse . " Gabriel 's voice was somber . The two men descended the steps to the courtyard . " What 's Papa doing ? " Miriam asked . all urged him to lie down on the sofa and try to sleep . He has n't slept all night . " Miriam met David 's sorrowful eyes . The eyes spoke to one another . Seeing again how their father had once come to them in pride and splendor ; now the eyes mourned for him . " I shall go right to the office when I leave here , " Gabriel said . " Maybe , after all , I 'll find a loophole , some way to salvage something . " This was more a question than a statement . " You wo n't , you know that , " Eugene told him . " Not even a clever lawyer like you . " " You are undoubtedly right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was , then , no hope . And yet , even so , there was comfort in just the presence of these two men , her brother and her stalwart friend . And Miriam felt their joint strength as if it were a wall to shelter her and to lean on . Where , though , as Emma had lamented , were all the friends and relatives who only a week ago had filled the house with celebration ? Then a second question struck hard . " Where will they go when they leave this house ? Where will they live ? " It was Eugene who answered with astonishing alacrity , " We shall take them in . " " We shall ? " " Certainly . The only other possibility is the Labouisse place with Pelagie and Sylvain , which actually is n't a possibility . How would it look for your father to go there when his own son-in-law has a home ? No , we shall have to take them in . As for Eulalie , she can go to the Labouisse place if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'm willing to take her , too , in spite of her prejudice . " A little satisfied smile bickered at the corners of Eugene 's full lips . Miriam said hesitantly , " Emma is worried about what will happen to Sisyphus . " " Oh , tell her I shall buy him for her . And while I 'm about it , that  | rascally pair , Chanute and Maxim , too . Why not ? If I 'm going to do this at all , I might as well do it right . " Such generosity must be acknowledged . Eugene was waiting for it . " You 're very generous , " she murmured , as Gabriel and David smiled in agreement . " Southerners take care of kin . It is a tradition among us , an obligation , " Eugene said . And he said again , " How would it appear to the community if I were to do anything less ? " " Still , it 's so good of you . " She sounded humble . Indeed , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would have been so much easier to accept the gift if instead Eugene had said : I shall do this because I 'm sorry for your father , because I 'm fond of him . The narrow channel of Bourbon Street overflowed with the Mardi Gras crowd . Costumed knights and noblemen , emblazoned , spangled , and plumed , riding in carriages or on beribboned horses , jostled and pushed their way among rowdies , prostitutes , and pickpockets under the crowded balconies . " Have n't we seen enough ? " David complained , stepping out of the press to a side street to avoid a trio of lurching drunks . He had always held himself aloof from the Mardi Gras . In spite of his compassion for humanity , he disliked all crowds , and in particular , he disliked this one . Protected as they were by masks , these holiday-makers seemed always to hover on the far , thin edge of good-natured celebration ; an accidental shove , a startled rearing horse , could push it over that edge into violent anger . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have such fascination for Jews ? He supposed it was simply the normal contagion of gaiety . That was the only reason he had gone this year , to cheer his father , who needed to be cheered . " By God ! " Eugene exclaimed . " If I were n't with all you proper gentlemen , I 'd know where to spend the rest of the night ! " They had come abreast of the Washington Ballroom . A crush of arrivals and departures spilled from the luminous dazzle indoors to fill the sidewalk and half the width of the street . A woman with sparkling beads laced into her long black hair ran out laughing on the arm of a blond masked youth . " The most beautiful women in the world , " Eugene cried , " bar none .  | I 've heard it said a thousand times by men who 've been all over the globe ? " From the darkness outside of the streaming light a man 's arms seized him by the shoulders , jerking him off his feet . " Goddamn you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you bastard ? Now it 's my turn ! " Eugene fell heavily to the pavement . There was a crash and tinkle of broken glass , then running feet pounded away into the darkness , and Eugene was screaming , screaming . " My eyes ! Oh , God , my eyes ! " The noisy night had gone dead still . The terrible cries were alone in the stillness . " Jesus ! " somebody said . Now a tremendous hubbub arose in the circling crowd . " What is it ? What happened ? " " A man threw something at him . " " He 's bleeding . " " No , it 's his eyes ! " " It 's his eyes , for Christ 's sake ! " " Get him up off the street ! " " Somebody call ? " Eugene 's legs moved , kicking the cobblestones . David bent over him , puffing at the hands that frantically cupped his eyes . " Somebody help me ! Hold him still . " A man brought a lantern . " Here ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see . When he straightened up , his voice shook with horror . " Lime ! My God ! Boiling lime ! " Ferdinand sank to his knees . " It was meant for me . " He sobbed . " You heard it . Meant for me . " " I 'll get a carriage , " Gabriel said . " We 'll take him home . Unless , David , you think we ought ? " Now a woman parted the crowd with her elbows . " Let me see ! I want to see ! They said it was Eugene Mendes . . . . " On the cobbles , in her satin skirt , she knelt over the wounded man , then turned her dark , anguished face up to David . " I know him . Take him to my house . It 's near , just down the street . " " That will be better , " David said . " Never mind the carriage , it 'll take too long . Let us carry him . " They laid him on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " David said . " Pour it on , spill it on . More . " " Let me , " the woman insisted . " I see how it 's done . " Her hands moved tenderly . The water spilled out of the basin onto the garish pink brocade pillow . She wept as Eugene moaned , wiping his eyes on her embroidered sleeve . " Oh , my dear , my dearest . Oh , my dear . " Over her head the glances traveled from David to Gabriel . The woman appealed to David . " You 're a doctor ? Is there nothing else to be done ? " " For the moment just keep flooding the eyes until the burning stops . Then we 'll see . You 're tired , " he said pityingly . " Let me do it . " Almost fiercely she thrust him away . " No , no , I will . " The fancy little room had by now filled with the curious ; pale brown ladies and their black servants hovered against the walls . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the couch . " Mama , what happened ? " he asked . " Darling , he 's been hurt . Some terrible person has hurt him . " This , David thought , this is the reason for my sister 's misery . This must be what it is all about . " Where 've you been ? " he asked Ferdinand , who had gone out for a minute and now came back , panting . " I gave a fellow on the street twenty-five cents to fetch Miriam , fifty cents if he ran . " " You what ? You sent for Miriam ? " " Well , naturally I did . What 's wrong ? " " You do n't understand where we are . " " Do you mind telling me what you 're talking about ? " " Look over there and you 'll know . " Still kneeling , the young woman had taken Eugene 's hand between both of hers . As though they were alone in the room , she kissed his palm , laying it against her cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . Comprehension came to Ferdinand . He said quickly , " I 'll head her off . I 'll stand outside and make some excuse that we 're bringing him right home . " It was too late . Miriam had already come in . " There 's been an accident , " David said at once . " We carried him in here , it was the nearest house . " " I know , the boy told me . " She walked to the sofa , where the woman  | got up from her knees and made a place . She touched her husband 's cheek . " Eugene , I 'm here . It 's Miriam . " He did not speak . For a long minute she stood looking down at him . What she might be concealing during that minute no one could tell ; her immobile face showed nothing . Only the quick rise and fall of her breathing told her brother anything at all ; the physician saw that she was agitated , as surely anyone would be , but David could only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And his own heart ached for her , standing there so young and alone in her simple dress and her dignity , bearing God only knew what sorrow within . Perversely , too , his heart ached for the dark voluptuous woman so agonized by her grief and unashamed of it . Presently Miriam turned to the other woman . " Thank you for sheltering my husband , " she said quietly . " Will someone please arrange for a litter or carriage to bring him home ? It is n't far . " At the door she drew David aside . " How bad is it , David ? Tell me the truth . " David considered and decided . Yes , she would meet this savage truth . Apparently she had already met some other truths . So he answered bluntly . " He will almost certainly be blind . " Friends , servants , and doctors moved in and out , up and down the stairs , carrying gifts and trays of food , whispering their commiseration and their curiosity . For some days Eugene lay against pillows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair at the window from which , with a critical eye , he had used to look down to see whether the flower beds were being properly tended . One by one the members of the household peered into the room , the servants overwhelmed with horror , Emma for once struck speechless , and Ferdinand sickened by his sense of responsibility for the disaster . The children came . During the worst first days they had been kept away . Now it was time to acquaint them with the change in their father . " It was an accident , " Miriam said gently . " Somebody threw some bad stuff by mistake . " Eugene had insisted that , at six , they were too young to know that the world contained human beings evil enough to destroy another human being 's eyes . " They will find it all out in time , " he had said . He took one of them on each knee .  | " It . was an accident , " he repeated . The children , not understanding , were simply curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugene 's glasses . " Does it hurt ? " " Not anymore . " Little Eugene asked whether he could see with the glasses off ? " No , son , " the father answered steadily . Such courage ! thought Miriam . He will not even allow his voice to waver , for his children 's sake . " Well , can you see with the glasses on ? " " No , son . I ca n't see at all . " Angelique put her hand up . " Ca n't you see my fingers ? " This was too much , even for a brave man , to have to bear . And Miriam interrupted , turning away from the light so that they would not see her wet eyes and blurt , Why are you crying , Mama ? " Your father will be going downstairs tomorrow or the next day . The doctor said so . And you two will keep him company , have breakfast on the verandah or in the garden , would n't that be nice ? You could pick some flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Eugene ? " She chattered ; the light , lying words rippled from her tongue . " You two can be such a great help until your father gets better . " " Then you 'll be all better soon , " Angelique said . " Well , never all better , " Eugene told her . Truth , he and Miriam had decided , but a gradual and easy truth ; do n't frighten them . " I 'll be walking around again soon , " he added . " I 'll get along fine , you 'll see I will . " Some weeks later David and Miriam stood in the quiet garden . " And so the professor has given the final word , " Miriam said bleakly . " No improvement , as I told you from the beginning . " The fountain trilled , making a sound too sprightly , David thought , for a house as burdened as this one . He put his hand on his sister 's shoulder . " What is it ? Tell me . It 's not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's not good to keep everything in , Miriam . One needs to talk to someone . Do you want to talk to me about  --  about the woman ? " " I do n't need to talk about her . I 've known about her for a long time , as you may have guessed . " Mystery within mystery , the Chinese box within a box , within a box , within ?  | " What , then ? " " Oh , many things . Mostly I think of Eugene . How terrible never to see ! Not even his children 's faces . And I think of poor Papa . His life 's been turned upside down . He 'll never forgive himself because that man , that devil , whoever he was , meant the punishment for him . " " It was n't Papa 's fault . " " No , but he feels guilty , all the same . I feel guilt , too , you know . Eugene has been so good to Papa and I do n't love Eugene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet it 's because of my father that he is blind ! " David sighed . In the sunlight the fountain splashed so prettily , with its graceful cascades so polished and smooth . The whole pastel city , polished and perfumed , was rotting underneath . Miriam was looking at the ground . Her head drooped sadly . He thought he knew what she was thinking . " You 're thinking that now you will never get away . That 's true , is n't it ? " " Yes , " she answered , in a voice so low that he could barely hear her . " It was never realistic , anyway . I should have known that . " Still , there is something else , he persisted to himself . She has not told me all . He did not know how he knew , yet he knew . But if it was not the woman Queen , what was it , then ? He tried one more time . " You do n't want to tell me anything else ? " " There is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving up , " well , I 've calls to make . A gangrenous foot . I 'd better go . " Miriam saw him first . Eugene had gone that morning for the daily drive with Maxim or Chanute that , after a season or two , had become his routine . Where he went , she had no need to ask . So it surprised her now to see him there on a bench in the square , with his blind eyes turned up toward the streaming light and a cluster of pigeons around his feet . Puzzled , she looked about for the carriage or a servant , but neither was in sight ; something warned her then to go on past and leave Eugene alone . Angelique cried , " Look ! There 's Father ! What 's he doing here by himself ? " " Leave him ! He wants ... " she began , but the children had gone running to their father . Eugene was not there by himself . A few feet behind him stood a tall boy holding a sketch pad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion  | almost feminine , he threw a handful of corn to the birds , Miriam knew at once who he was . That grim scene flashed again ; the cramped , gaudy room , Eugene writhing on a couch , the woman passionately weeping , the scared boy hovering ... . She had no choice now but to face the moment . " The doctors want me to exercise , " Eugene was saying , " so Pierre took me for a walk . " His name was Pierre . She wondered what he used for a last name . Young Eugene said stoutly , " I could take you , Father . Why did n't you ask me ? " " You 're not old enough yet to lead me , son . " " I 'm almost as big as he is ! How old are you ? " young Eugene demanded of the other boy . " Thirteen . " The voice was almost a whisper , deferential , as were the backward steps taken to give space to the thrusting pair of seven-yearolds . Yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twins to Miriam . He knows who we are , she thought . He remembers me , of course . But he must have been told everything even before that . How strange it is that they always know all about us , while we do n't even know they exist ! And she wondered what Eugene 's eyes would have said had they been able to meet hers during this discomfiting encounter . " Come , children , " she urged brightly , " your father wants to rest . Come along home . " But they protested . Angelique could be especially stubborn . " Why must we ? Father , you do n't want us to go home now , do you ? " " I think you should . Do what your mother tells you . " Little Eugene stood on his toes to see the drawing board . " What are you drawing ? " he wanted to know . " The pigeons . " And Pierre , lowering the board , faced it outward so that Miriam could see his work . He had caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradations of iridescent feathering . He had caught the heaving motion of the flock , the peck and rise , the flutter and strut . The little sketch had a startling beauty . Miriam felt a sudden softness in herself . The way he stood there , so shy of speech , so painfully conscious of the situation , and still proud enough to want them to see his work ! " It 's lovely , " she said . And something , some sense of pity or fairness ,  | compelled her to give this perception to her husband . " Pierre is talented , Eugene . Professional . " He did not reply . His face was flushed . " Where did you learn to do that ? " asked Angelique , " I have art lessons . " " You ca n't go to school , " the little girl said . Miriam could only wince at the cruelty of the remark . For , at seven , what could a child know ? Only enough to know that color was status , to know without being told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant in his proper place , which did not include school . " Blaise can draw , " said little Eugene . " Blaise belongs to my father and mother . Who do you belong to ? " " To Mr. Mendes , " Pierre replied . The statement was flat , conveying no more than the fact . For an instant his hand brushed Eugene 's shoulder , then was removed , as though he had quickly recalled the fitness of things . Conceived , most probably , by accident , thought Miriam . And probably unwanted ; at least , it was doubtful that Eugene had wanted this superfluous boy , . , She felt oppressed , saddened , angry , and bewildered . " I insist you come home now ! " Her voice was so sharp that the children turned to her in surprise . Abruptly Eugene stood up , seizing his cane . " You will find Maxim at the carriage , " he directed Pierre . " Tell him thatlI have walked home . " Miriam asked Eugene , " Are you sure you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question merely a thing of words to fill air and time as she guided him out of the square . " It 's my sight that I 've lost , not my legs . " The children had once more run ahead . The incident in the square , which for them had been without significance , now lay behind them ; they were having an argument over the ownership of a white cat that had recently strayed into the yard . After a minute or two Eugene spoke again . " Go on . Say what you have to say . Get it over with . " " I 'd rather not . " Confusion was still in her . She was n't even sure how she felt , or ought to feel . " Well , it happened this way . I quite thoughtlessly accepted the boy 's suggestion that we go for a walk . " He spoke sternly , covering his own embarrassment over a situation in which a gentleman should not have  | allowed himself to be caught . " Quite thoughtlessly . a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No reply was needed . And Miriam concentrated her thoughts on her two , who were by now far ahead . It was lucky they were n't both boys , or both girls . There would have been much more rivalry . This way they really got on quite well , considering how young they were . So she consoled herself for her other lacks with her satisfaction in her children . At the same time the image of that other child floated through her head and steadied itself there ; his narrow hands on the drawing board , his lowered lashes , and when he raised them , the unanswerable question in his eyes .  | " So life goes on , " Emma said brightly , opening another invitation as she read her mail at the breakfast table . She had at last accepted her position in the Mendes household with remarkable grace . A valiant lady , Miriam reflected , It took real courage to learn the art of receiving when one had always been a dispenser of gifts . " Do you suppose , Miriam my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could persuade your cook to make biere douce sometime ? My Serafina used to do it for your father . He loves it and it 's quite simple , really , just a few pineapple peelings , brown sugar , cloves , and rice . " " I 'll tell her , Aunt Emma . " " Thank you , my dear . Oh , my , listen to this ! My cousin Grace writes about that awful Tremont business . The old lady was a cousin of Grace 's on the other side , you remember . Murdered in her bed ! By a crowd of savages whom she 'd raised and fed from childhood ! " " It 's said , though , that her son was a cruel man . He sold them away without heart and they were badly fed , " Miriam began , but was stopped by a snort from Eugene . " Rubbish ! That 's what they always say . Abolitionist rubbish ! " " Oh , see , " Emma said , " here 's a letter from Marie Claire . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine reception . Her teacher predicts increasing success . Is n't that amazing ! I always knew she could sing , but I really never thought she would ... oh , they have made some fine contacts in Paris . . . . The Baroness Pontalba . . . you knew she 's from New Orleans , did n't you , Miriam ? Yes , it was her father who built the cathedral , the cabildo , and the presbytere . They married her off to Pontalba when he came here from France , and it never worked out . It 's just all wrong , I always say , forcing or coaxing a marriage  --  they 're both the same when you come down to it it does n't work out . "  | " No , " Miriam assented faintly . It was hard to believe what she was hearing from the same Emma who had well , no matter now . " There was such a scandal . Quarrels over money , you know . Her father-in-law , the old baron , tried to kill her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the baroness is coming back here to build on her property in the Place d'Armes . The Perrins may eventually buy an apartment there when they 're finished . Goodness ! They 're planning to sell their house ! " " Who is ? What house ? " Miriam asked in the same faint voice . " Why , the new house that they 've never lived in . How strange ! " " Do they say when they 're coming back ? " " Let 's see . No . They are planning to stay abroad a while longer because of her progress . . . . Oh , but Andre must be disappointed . ... To think he planned that wonderful house himself . ... Well , if they move to the Place d'Armes , I know Pelagie will be pleased . They 'll be around the corner . Pelagie was always rather fond of Marie Claire , odd as she is . And Andre is so agreeable , do n't you think so , Miriam ? " " Oh , yes , most agreeable . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Singing . I do n't know why he puts up with it . " Eulalie nodded agreement , and then remembering that Eugene could not see the nod , repeated , " Disgraceful . " Eulalie , who had been staying in her sister 's town house , had been spending most of her days with Eugene , reading aloud to him and waiting on him , moving his chair from sun to shade . A curious relationship had developed . Eugene is a Jew , but she overlooks that , Miriam thought , because he allows her to serve him . He accepts her and no other man ever has . They made an odd contrast , he with his lavish beard and she with her scanty hair , too thin even to hold her combs . " Where 's my son ? " the father asked now . " I have n't seen him since this morning . " Eulalie stood up . " I 'll fetch him for you . " The children , especially the boy  --  or could it , Miriam thought bitterly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ? ? were all Eugene still cared about . Except for them he had removed himself from everything that had once filled his life . He was a crumbling castle , falling into ruin . His long silences were almost more disturbing than his tempers had been . She tried to comfort him , to reach out to him in his disaster , to tell him he was not alone . " Do n't , " he would say . " You do n't mean it . We do n't mean it . "  | She protested . " I do mean it , Eugene . What kind of a human being do you think I am ? " She had suggested a club , the Pelican Club , where doctors and lawyers , bankers and brokers , met to play brag and eat dinners prepared by a superb French chef . " The finest people in the city belong , " she said , appealing to his snobbishness . And he had retorted , " I already know the finest people in the city . Clubs are all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need clubs . " You 're a Jew , she thought , not a Creole , but of course a Jew could align himself with whatever forces he wished . Very well , Eugene had chosen to consider himself a Creole . She had suggested that he be driven to the office every morning . Someone there could read reports to him and he would make decisions as before . He had refused that , too . " No , Scofield is a good enough manager . I 'll leave things in his hands . " Miriam was n't so sure . Last month Scofield had brought a note to be signed . " What 's this ? " Eugene had inquired after his listless hand had been guided to write his signature . " Nothing of any great importance , " Scofield had told him . " I had to borrow from the bank . Just temporarily to tide us over the month until they pay for the last London shipment . " As he was leaving , Miriam had stopped the man in the hall . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had to before , did we ? " And he had looked at her with insolence in his eyes , while giving a courteous answer . " Nothing to worry about at all , ma'am . A common business practice . A lady should n't have to worry herself with such things . " But she had burned with anger . Now she tried to put these thoughts at the back of her mind . " Shall you be coming this afternoon to the temple dedication , Eugene ? " " No . I ca n't see it , so why should I go ? " She had expected the refusal , for he had a dread of showing his infirmity in public places . She understood that . When at certain angles the light struck his glasses , one could see the shriveled , dead-white eyes . Scorched flesh shone hideously pink from forehead to cheek . She had a mixture of feelings : first pity , then shuddering horror , then  | shame , a shame all the more painful because Eugene had never with the slightest word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spring sunshine fell on the crowd at the corner of Canal and Bourbon streets . It whitened six tall Ionic columns under the splendid entablature of what had once been Christ Church Episcopal and was now , through the beneficence of Judah Touro , becoming the Nefutzoth Yehudah Synagogue . The splendid organ was still pealing after the service while a crowd of the rich and famous , Jew and non-Jew alike , in flowered bonnets and silk hats , lingered on the sidewalk to watch the dignitaries . " The choir was magnificent , " said Rosa . Her eyes fell fondly on her sons . " Your father would have been in his glory today . Look , there 's Isaac Leeser , come all the way from Philadelphia . " " He 's staying at Kursheedt 's house . He must have had a dozen invitations , but he wanted a kosher home , " David said meaningfully . " Is n't that Touro ? " Miriam asked . Encircled by admirers in rainbow colors , Touro stood starkly in his somber black suit . His deep eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stern mouth were dark . The conversation on the homeward walk made much of him , as they passed the arcaded Touro Block and the bark Judah Touro on the riverfront , ready for departure . " Astonishing , " Gabriel remarked . " He has even become a Sabbath observer . Turned his life upside down at his age . After that , nothing seems impossible . " And Miriam remembered that he was one of the people who had made it possible . Suddenly she wanted to tell him of the fear which had been nagging at her for weeks . He was the family 's lawyer , after all . So when Rosa , with David and her sons , walked ahead on the narrow banquette , she began , " I am worried . It 's about my husband 's business affairs . " She related the incident of the note and the encounter with Scofield . " I fear for us , for my children . Of course , I know nothing about business . I try to talk to Eugene , but he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has lost his " I know that , " Gabriel said quietly . " I daresay it 's unbecoming of me . " She heard herself apologizing . " I 'm certain Mr. Scofield is an honest man , but ? " " Are you ? One can never be certain about anyone . " " Well , then , I do n't know what is to be done . "  | " I 'm only your husband 's lawyer . I have no power to examine his books without his permission . I 've tried to speak to him , too , but as you say , he 's lost interest . He has affairs in Memphis , cotton and lumber , which should be looked to . " Miriam felt suddenly lost , as if a chill wind had blown through the warm afternoon . And she repeated , " It 's as if he does n't want to think anymore . " " Then someone must think for him . " " But there is no one ! Surely not my father ! And David knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no one to protect them . " " They have you . " " I ? What can I do ? I 'm a woman . " Gabriel stopped and looked down at her . " You can learn , " he said sternly . " Who will teach me ? " " I will . But you must get Eugene 's permission to act in his stead . " Eugene would not grant it . " What ! You to sit in an office and deal with men ? No , I 'm hardly such a fool as that ! Not yet . I will take Scofield over you any day . " In spite of herself Miriam was relieved . Eugene was right : How was she to sit in an office and deal with men ? Yet she was troubled all that summer . In the autumn Scofield came again to the house with papers for Eugene 's signature . Again , having glimpsed a bank 's letterhead , she was certain that they were loans . This time Scofield avoided her , almost running in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watching him rush down the front walk and slip out of sight around the corner , it seemed to her that she was being given forewarning of disaster . She had lived long enough in New Orleans to know that fortunes are lost far more quickly than they are made . And she kept standing there , staring into the street , seeing not the child rolling a hoop , not the fruit cart , not the two old women chatting on the walk , seeing only that specter of disaster . That night Angelique had a bad dream . Her cry woke Miriam out of the heavy sleep in which an aching mind seeks relief from its pressures . The child was standing up in bed holding a doll . The beam from the candle made black pits of her eyes . " There 's no place to go , " she whispered , " no place . " Miriam saw that she was terrified . She sat on the bed , drawing her daughter down onto her lap .  | " No place to go ? Tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thought I was standing in the street all alone and I did n't know where to go . " " No , no , you 're right here in your pretty bed , with the pink quilt that Aunt Emma gave you , and your dolls , and your brother in the next room , and Papa 's down the hall , and we 're  --  " " But Papa had no place to go ! They took his table away ! " Puzzled for a moment , Miriam remembered then how Emma had mourned the loss of her furniture at the sheriff 's sale , especially the loss of the grand mahogany dining table at which twenty-four had been able to sit in comfort . Much as they had tried to conceal the disaster from the children , apparently the children had felt its impact , after all . Poor little beings ! The chilly hand of foreboding passed over her flesh and the voice of fear whispered : There 'll be no one to shelter all of you as we did Papa . " You were dreaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're never going to leave this house . It 's ours , with everything in it . " " But Papa  --  " " Papa 's here , too , quite safe with us . " Her fingers moved in Angelique 's hair and smoothed the ruffles around the small neck . " Anyway , you must n't think of all that . That was different , Angelique . " " Why was it ? " the child persisted . " Because it just was . It 's too hard to explain . You have to believe me . I never fib to you , do I ? " " No . " " Well , then . Go back to sleep , dear . Everything 's really all right . " Back in her own bed , she scolded herself for having caught the child 's fright . " That was different , Angelique , " she had said . How could she be sure it was ? Oh , stop this , Miriam ! Things are always worse in the middle of the night , you ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . There may be nothing wrong at all . This is your morbid imagination . Or maybe not . So early one evening , having got the office keys from Eugene 's desk , she went downtown to look over the books . The figures in columns and rows were absolutely meaningless to her , but a letter in Scofield 's top drawer was very clear . It was a peremptory demand and warning from the Bank of New Orleans , about an overdue note . The thing shook in her hand .  | And she walked home slowly , reluctant to face Eugene with a crisis which he was not ready to confront . At the same time , who was ready to confront it ? In the Place d'Armes , although it was almost dusk , workmen were still clambering and clattering on the Pontalba Building . Low light touched the bricks with rose and , lying on ornamental black iron scrollwork , turned it shiny as licorice . The best of everything was going into these houses for the most fashionable families in the city . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move here ? Miriam stood still . Strange that she no longer felt the old pain , yet could so sharply recall that she had once felt it . She wondered whether it would come back when he returned . She hoped , almost , that he would not return , certainly not to live here . And at the same time she scanned the building as if to guess which of the windows would be his . On a second-floor balcony a woman was kneeling to examine a window frame . That must be the baroness ! She had been the talk of the city since she had returned from Europe to keep an eye on her property , climbing ladders in her pantaloons . Extraordinary woman ! One could n't help but wonder at the drive and daring of such a woman , who obviously had no care for " what people thought . " Extraordinary ! Eugene was not at home . He had left no message ; he never did ; where he had gone was understood . The bank 's letter would have to wait until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about " an intelligent expression " and " energetic movements . " So Miriam read rapidly . From her frank and unostentatious style . . . one of those energetic ladies who , thrown upon their own resources and compelled to lay aside much of their feminine reserve , devote themselves industriously and energetically to the support of their dependent families .... Her proper businesslike style .. . Miriam laid the paper aside . " The support of their dependent families , " she repeated aloud . " Their feminine reserve , " she said , frowning a little . " A proper businesslike style . " She stood up and began to undress , thinking all the while about the baroness . In the tall glass she watched her dress fall to the floor , then  | the white muslin petticoat , the pleated horsehair petticoat , then a corded calico skirt , the crinoline , and finally the winter flannel petticoat . And remembering the pantaloons , it came to her that there was something humorous about all this clothing . One could n't very well climb a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had no need to climb a ladder , butShe picked up the paper again , eagerly reading : " Energetic ladies thrown upon their own resources . . . " Something ran up and down her spine , light fingers of excitement and fear . Your children have you , Gabriel had said . I will teach you , he had said . Why not ? In the morning she went to Eugene . He was sitting in his wing chair holding a small object , turning it over as if to see it with his fingers . Hearing her come in , he placed it carefully on the table , and she saw what it was : a tawny clay figurine , painted and glazed , a recumbent lion . " That 's very good , Eugene . " For a moment she hesitated before questioning gently , " Is it  --  the boy 's ? " He nodded . " The color is perfect , a kind of sandy gold . " She saw that , for whatever reason , he did not welcome the subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion , of his feelings . " I have a letter from the bank , " she said then . " I 'll read it to you . " " They sent a letter to you ? " " They sent it to your manager , Mr. Scofield , and I took it from his desk . No , listen to me before you explode . Listen to me . " When Miriam had read the letter , Eugene was silent . Shock and humiliation washed over his tired face . But most of all what one saw was a weary , gray indifference . So the course lay plain before her . " Now will you give me permission to work ? I will do nothing without the advice of Gabriel Carvalho . I will learn what I need to know , as once I had to learn to speak your languages here . Now will you give it to me ? " His silence was assent . Presently , he got up . " Get the carriage for me . I 'm going out . " " The carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then ? "  | Eugene turned toward her without answering . She saw his cheek twitch . " It 's all right , Eugene ! Do n't you think I know you still go there ? " She followed him to the hall , where Sisyphus waited to help him down the stairs . " Please tell Maxim , " she instructed Sisyphus , " to take Mr. Mendes to the house on Chartres Street where he always goes . And to wait for him if he wishes . " The instruction was certainly superfluous , since the routine was always the same . But it was a fine relief to say aloud what had been secret . Oh , it would give them something to gossip about in the kitchen ! She felt some pride in being able to acknowledge freely what other people might construe as a humiliation . In the public acknowledgment of this thing it ceased to be a humiliation . Besides , she had more important things to think about now .  | The city was barely awake when David turned his horse eastward into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectful master  --  servant distance , and the two horses moved at a nice trot . David 's medical kit was slung over the saddle horn , and his pistols hung heavily from his belt . Having never in his life carried a weapon , he was acutely aware of them , and would not have had them if Lucien had not refused to accompany him again unless he was armed . Arms , however , attracted no attention . A southern gentleman was expected to carry a pistol or a dirk or both . A violent people under the surface of courtesy , David reflected now , as he rode past the dueling oaks behind the cathedral where , only last week , he had been summoned to help two handsome boys who had shot each other to death in a silly argument about an actress . Not more than eighteen , they had been , when their blood had gushed away into the ground . Lucien was apprehensive today . He " felt things in his bones . " David , however , had no reason to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual . First to come was a leader 's policy meeting under the guise of a social celebration at an inn . Then , in the evening , the gathering with Negro leaders in the swamp hideout would be held . In neither place was there any need for weapons . Weapons had never been what he wanted , anyway . Words and ideas were always far more potent , for in the end there was no defense against ideas . Certainly things were coming to a head now in the political area . The Whig party was moribund and the burgeoning new Republican party was spreading through the North . More and more the slave power was having to defend itself Defend itself ! How , for instance , a man like Judah Benjamin could stand up in the United States Senate and speak as he did , David would never understand ! Slaves are property , he says ;  | there is no right in law to rob a man of his property . Well , Charles Sumner might call Benjamin the most brilliant orator in the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant manners have nothing to do with morality . For a Jew to talk like that ! Not that Benjamin was much of a Jew ! Yet David supposed a Jew had as much right as anyone to be wrong . Even the rabbis , like the clergy of every other denomination , were in disagreement among themselves these days . Up in New York Rabbi Raphall quoted Exodus as authority for slavery . Oh , says the rabbi , he himself is not a slave owner , but it is certainly not forbidden to own slaves , provided that one treats them with dignity and kindness . His sermon is praised and quoted throughout the South . In vehement rebuttal , Rabbi Einhorn of Baltimore replies : It is the essence of the Bible that we must follow , not its primitive customs . Of course slavery is mentioned there , as were polygamy and royalty , both of which have been abolished in the United States ! Now , as they crossed the city line , the horses ' hooves struck quietly on sandy ground . The autumn air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . Ahead of him the road ran to the railroad tracks and beyond . At the crossing he reined the horse in and stood a moment observing the double black gleam of the tracks . There was direct service now all the way to New York . A frown turned the lines on his forehead into furrows . Lucien rode up to him . " You 'd never make it , " he said softly . " You 'd be caught at the next station . Boat 's the only way , I keep telling you . " " I 'm not going to be caught . " " Let us hope not . " Fear trickled through his veins . It felt cold . Any man who says he can face a painful death without fear is a liar . I am terribly afraid , he told himself . Yet there was something stronger than fear within him , a hatred of the enemy  --  the system , not the men who ran it  --  so powerful that it seemed as if the system would have to weaken in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and die before he himself could die . His frown deepened . He clucked to the horse and called back to Lucien. c " Come on , let 's move , we 've a long day . "  | Out of the swampland rose a mist so heavy that , in spite of the moonlight , only the innermost ring of trees could be seen from the spot where David halted . Beyond lay the jungle night . A constant dripping from the trees came steadily , like drums or marching feet . " Draw the cloak collar up around your face , " Lucien advised . " Will you stop whispering ? I ca n't hear you , " David demanded irritably . With nerves on edge , he was impatient . Now Lucien was impatient . " I said , cover your face up to the eyes and pull the hat down . You must not be recognized . Do n't you understand that yet ? " " Thank God it 's chilly , then , " David grumbled . He strained to see into the blackness , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminds me of ? ' ' he began , and stopped , having been about to say something about Macbeth 's witches , before remembering that the remark would have no significance for Lucien . " I have n't the slightest idea where the road is , " he complained . " Are you sure you know where we 're going ? " " Have faith . Another five minutes ' walk and we 'll be there . " Soon their feet caught in a soggy muck , so that each step became a struggle against a strong downward suction . " Sorry , " Lucien apologized . " But the wetter it is , the better to foil the dogs . They can follow a dry trail for five miles or more , with enough strength left at the end of it to tear a man apart . " " I still do n't know how you know where you are . " " Oh , you get to recognize your landmarks . My brother lived in the cypress swamp for three years after he ran away . He and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night for food . " " You never told me . " " I did n't want to talk about it . " " Is he in the group we 're seeing tonight ? " " No . He was hanged . " And as David had no comment to that , Lucien continued , " An abolitionist from Illinois got them into a big group , maybe two thousand Negroes , making cartridges and other ammunition . But the vigilantes found out . That 's the trouble when the group 's too big . There 's bound to be somebody who talks too much  --  Stop ! Listen ! " A muffled , stealthy swishing of foliage being carefully moved aside came from the left . The two men waited . A moment later a smudge of light emerged from the trees , like moonglow behind clouds , revealing first a lantern , then the man who held it , and finally a circle of ten men ,  | each with his weak light , together making a pool of light in the cramped clearing . Lucien held his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone to talk to you tonight . Do n't ask who he is . You do n't need to know . He 's a friend . That 's enough . He would n't be here otherwise , because it 's a great risk and you all know it . I tried to talk him out of coming , but he wanted to come . Draw in closer . " In total silence the men obeyed . David was ringed with ghostly white teeth and eyewhites glistening out of blackness . " Where are the horses ? " Lucien asked . A man answered . " Two good horses , rested and saddled . Right there behind those trees . " " Horses ? " David inquired . " For us . For you if there 's need . See where I 'm pointing ? Go directly south . In less than a mile you 'll reach the road . Turn right onto it and from there it 's straight to the city line . " " But , " David objected , " what about our horses in the hotel stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll have to get out of here fast , " Lucien warned . " Listen to me . You 'll go the way I just told you . I 've got another route for myself . It 's safer like that . You understand ? " David nodded . Tonight , it seemed , the servant and master had exchanged places . " I understand , " he said somberly . " All right . Now begin . " David stepped forward . " I 've come to you because I have the same wish you have , to make life better for you and for us all . " No one moved . His little speech , which he had not prepared beforehand , came without effort , came naturally and truthfully from the heart . " Sometimes it must seem to you that the changes we seek will never come , or at least not soon enough for you who are alive today to get any benefit from them . " Someone shifted a lantern , splashing light upward , so that there fell into David 's line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with worshipful concentration . This , finally , is my meeting with reality , he thought , with brave flesh and vulnerable bones . All things before this were only plans and talk , philosophy and paper . Yet at the same time he was standing outside of this reality , observing himself here in the eerie night , an actor in a fantastic dream . " If thousands of you should refuse to work for anything but wages ,  | which would of course mean freedom , that would mean winning without violence . " He paused . Dark as it was , he could sense the instant stiffening of bodies , could sense the tilted heads , the listening . The hair on his forearms prickled . A dog barked ; the signal smashed the waiting stillness . Almost at once the stillness exploded with a violent crash of hooves , and the clamor of voices . The circle broke . In frenzy the men dropped their lanterns , scattering themselves in the shelter of the underbrush . A moment later half a dozen men on horseback waving torches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of their rest , cawed and flapped ; horses neighed ; the woods came awake . Lucien and David stared at one another as if questioning their own senses , as if dazed . Then , " For Christ 's sakes , run ! " Lucien cried . " Go ! " Rearing horses went wild . The huge animals , quivering under the whip and the terror , trampled through the underbrush . " Run ! " Lucien screamed again . " David ! To the road ! " A horse wheeled across David 's path . " David ! " the rider cried . " So it 's David ! You " ? he raised a pistol ? " you scum ! " Out of the torchlight blazed the furious eyes of Sylvain Labouisse . Hate ! Kill ! said the mad eyes . David drew his pistol . Sylvain 's shot splattered in the leafage over David 's head , while his own shot knocked Sylvain out of the saddle . " Go ! " screamed Lucien . " He recognized you . " David swung up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sister 's or to Gabriel Carvalho , either one , I 'll need money . I do n't want them mixed up in this , just some money ! " And he spurred the horse into the swamp . Ten minutes later , as he pounded over the empty road , that queer sensation came again , as if a voice were saying : This is a dream , you know . Things like this do n't happen in the space of minutes . Why , not half an hour ago you got up from supper at the hotel , said good night to your friends , and arranged to meet again in a month . Yesterday you were seeing patients . Now you are fleeing for your life . No , it simply ca n't be . A man like you does n't pull a pistol out of a holster without even thinking . Why , you 've never even held one in your hand before ! And was that really Sylvain Labouisse , and did you shoot him ? Kill him ,  | perhaps ? God forbid ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to kill you ? You 've never harmed him , never harmed anyone ! Not you , who care so much about the world . Maybe , though , it 's a little bit crazy to care so much about the world . Maybe you should mind your own affairs . Who do you think you are ? The Messiah ? " Oh , my God , " he said aloud . And before his horrified eyes , hanging in the air between the laidback ears of the racing horse , was the grieving , uncomprehending sweet face of Pelagie . When the door opened , the draft caught the remains of the burning papers and sent a flurry of scorched fragments over the floor . " There 's no time to bother with that . Leave it , " Lucien said . " I 'm ready . " David picked up his traveling bag . Dressed in a topcoat with a dark woolen shawl over his shoulders , he looked like any gentleman about to go on a journey . " I 've burned MacKenzie 's lists so no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked about the drab little room . " My books . I hate to leave my books . " " I 'll send them to you , " Miriam said , " as soon as I know where you 'll be . " And she rearranged the shawl , which did not need rearranging . " Do n't linger , David . Every second counts . " Gabriel nodded toward Miriam . " She 's in terrible danger here ! " As if suddenly inspired , David grasped his sister 's shoulders . " Listen ? you should n't have come . . . but now that you 're here , listen , you used to talk about getting away . . . . You could . . . . Lucien could get young Eugene and Angelique . . . only another couple of minutes . . . . We could all go . " " No ! " Gabriel cried vehemently . " No ! You 're not thinking straight . How do you know you 'll make it to the boat , or that the boat wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more than you already have . " " You 're right , of course , you 're right . But still ? " " I could n't anyway , " Miriam said . " How could I leave Papa now ? And Eugene , blind ? I 'm just now putting things in order . " David put his arms around his sister . " So , again I leave you . When you need me , when I should be here at your right hand , I leave you . " He mourned ; his eyes , his voice , and his own right hand , as it stroked her hair , all mourned . " Dear David , do n't worry about me . It 's only you we should be  | thinking of right now . Oh , take care of yourself ! Do n't , do n't , do any more foolish awful things ! I mean  --  oh , I do n't know what I mean ! Just take care of yourself , my dear . " Lucien pulled David 's sleeve , " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get where you 're going , you 'll let me know , " Gabriel said . " I 'll send whatever you need to start up again . You 've got enough money for now . The skiff is marked Elsie Ann . You 're sure you know how to sail , Lucien ? " " Yes , yes , I know . " Lucien was already out the door . " Very well . Once you 're over the state line in Mississippi , you 'll manage . " Taking David 's hand , Gabriel propelled him to the door . " Good God , what a rotten business ! But God bless you anyway . Now , go ! Go , will you ? " When the hurrying steps had died away , Gabriel sighed . " What a rotten business , " he repeated . " Now give me the key . We 'll lock the house and I 'll see you home . Does anyone know Lucien came to your house ? " " Only Fanny , and she does n't know why . Besides , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You should n't have been mixed up in this at EQL.11 " You are , and you are n't his brother . " " One has one 's reasons . Complicated reasons , sometimes , " Gabriel said gently . " This is the second time you rescued him , do you realize that ? " Gabriel smiled . How rare his smile is , Miriam thought ; it spreads so slowly as if his face were astonished at the sweetness of its own smile . The stillness was absolute . Not a leaf moved through the heavy air . And they stood a moment , savoring the silence , relieving the tension of the past half hour . Suddenly Gabriel flung his arm up . " Listen . Do you hear anything ? " " No , nothing . Yes , yes , I do . " " Shh . It 's horses . Coming this way . Down Royal Street , I think . " The beat and clatter of hooves grew nearer and clearer . " Get back into the house . There 's no time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hide here . No , wait . Wait a moment . " From a roll of bandage on the shelf he ripped off a piece . " Tie this around my head , over my ear . Make a big wad , tight . That 's it . " Wonderingly , her heart racing , her mouth dry with fear , Miriam obeyed . " Now , outside . Get out in the courtyard . "  | " Where ? Where ? " she cried , in panic now . The horses had turned into the street and voices were heard , men calling to one another . " Anywhere . Do n't make a sound , no matter what happens . " In the bushes behind the necessary Miriam crouched , huddling in her skirts . Gabriel had lit a candle . Through the window she could see him sitting with his bandaged head resting on the back of the chair , She could hear the pounding on the front door , could see him get up and admit three disheveled , frantic men . " Where 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm waiting for him , " Gabriel complained . " I 've got the devil of an earache . " " Do n't I know you ? You 're a lawyer , are n't you ? " " Yes . Carvalho . Gabriel Carvalho . And you ? " " Lloyd Morrissey . You been here long ? " " About an hour . What 's wrong ? What 's happened ? " " Plenty . Sylvain Labouisse has been shot . Raphael shot him . " " Dr. Raphael did ? Why , I never knew him even to carry a gun . A very gentle man , he ? " " It was Raphael , all right . Shot Labouisse out of the saddle . " " I ca n't believe it . Is Labouisse hurt badly ? " " Badly ? He 's dead . " " But the servant who let me in , " Gabriel persisted , " told me the doctor had been out for hours . A woman giving birth , he said , a bad case . I think he said it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much attention , my ear hurts so . " " The servant lied to you . He 's not out on a call , he 's getting out of town . " Someone called . " Come on , Morrissey , for Christ 's sake , let 's spread out , one of us is bound to get hold of him . " The door crashed shut and the silence rushed back . Miriam waited for some minutes until she heard Gabriel 's low call . " Come quickly . They 'll be hunting up and down the city . Follow me , stay close to the building line . " Shreds of cloud sailed across the moon , darkening the street , and drifting past the moon , released bright silver to illumine the banquette . " You must n't be seen , " Gabriel whispered over her shoulder . " Walk as fast and lightly as you can . You never know who might be awake even at this hour . Plots and deaths , " she heard him mutter as they crept through the streets .  | Stooping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he nevertheless cast a tall shadow . How he must hate all this ! Miriam thought . It 's against everything in his nature . And it crossed her mind , frightened and tense as she was , that , although David 's emergency , with its revelation of what he had been doing during the past few years , had come as a shock , it had , on reflection , not been a surprise , for it was in keeping with the character of David . But one could never imagine Gabriel doing anything so incautious , so imprudent ! Yet here he was , forceful and strong in this moment of crisis ; she knew , following his rapid walk toward home , that he would get her there safely . He would come through for her , as surely he had just done for David . She heard his whisper as they turned the final corner . " David ought to be on the river by now . He had just enough minutes to spare , I 'm fairly sure . And thank God for that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procession marched in respect to Sylvain Labouisse , acknowledging his civic benefactions . All was still . All was black . Six horses , blanketed and plumed in black , pulled the black funeral car ; the canopy above the coffin was draped in black . Only the white chrysanthemums heaped on the coffin and the white dove perched on the canopy relieved the pall . " It reminds me , " Rosa whispered , " of the memorial service for Lafayette . That was in thirty-four . Only of course they had a bust of Lafayette instead of a coffin . But this is just as solemn . " Annoyed by her chatter , Miriam moved forward . Women  --  since women did not go to funerals  --  were standing outside the cathedral on the steps . Properly speaking , they ought not to have been even that near , but Rosa was curious , and Miriam had gone as far as possible with her father , to be there when he came out . The poor man was almost ill from shock . She had tried to ease the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much of which she felt herself " Sylvain would have killed him , too , Papa . Remember that . " " It was David 's own doing ! If he had n't been there , if he had n't got himself mixed up in these dirty affairs ... " " Papa , try to think . This whole tragedy came out of David 's beliefs , his honest beliefs . It was not a dirty affair . You have to admit he acted honestly . " She had been met with a look of such outrage and agony that she had closed her mouth .  | How men were disappointed in their sons ! Poor Papa ! Once more to be brought to his knees , as if the financial crash had not been enough . Whether or not others , especially Emma , would censure him for David 's act  --  and except for Eulalie , who was in a savage rage , Miriam felt confident that they did not  --  Ferdinand felt that they did , and would probably feel so always . Now just past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row . He had come in last to avoid being seen . And she wondered what he would say if he could know the part she had played in her brother 's escape . Steady , steady , she said to herself . Think of something else . Straight before her , far down the aisle , stood the jeweled glitter of the altar . Her eyes moved from gilded lettering on the arch . There on a mural St. Louis , king of France , proclaimed the start of the Seventh Crusade . Swords and blood ! Burning Jews in their huddled streets as they marched across Europe . Enough ! Enough blood spilled here , without remembering all the centuries . No , he had said that day at Beau Jardin when he first came back , no , a wife would not fit with what I intend to do in my life . And far back , long ago in Europe , their grandfather had said , with some pride and some vexation , How stubborn he is when he thinks a thing is right . Who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle tips . The whole world trembles . " You 're taking it very hard , " Rosa said kindly . " No one blames it on you . " " It 's not that . I was thinking of Pelagie , " which was also true . Cascades of grief flowed from the organ . The coffin came first in the procession of men in mourning coats and tall hats . At the curb where Eugene and Ferdinand were getting into their carriage , Gabriel caught up with Miriam . His glance said : This knowledge we share . He spoke quietly . " Are you all right ? " I must look like death , she thought , and said , " I 'm going to see Pelagie . " " Catholic women here wait nine days before paying condolence calls , " Rosa reminded her . " I 'm not Catholic and I have to see her . " Rosa laid a hand on Miriam 's arm . " She may not want to see you , " she said gently .  | " That is what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , standing in the upstairs bedroom and Pelagie was saying , " Oh , you 're going to be a beauty , darling , and your papa will buy diamonds for your ears . " The front door was hung with gray crepe , and Miriam , sounding the knocker , remembered that for married people , unless they were old , colors of mourning were lavender or gray . In the center hung a wreath of black beads containing strands of Sylvain 's hair under a velvet bow . All these structures and customs , she thought . All of us keep them in our differing ways , to ease our sorrow . And do they ease it ? How can I know ? I have never had a sorrow like hers . Someone opened the door and left her . Uncertain where to go , she stood in the hall . It was dim . All the shades were drawn , and the enormous mirror was covered with a cloth . The clock under the stairs read nine fifteen ; it had been stopped at the hour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deserted swamp , my brother ? She held her head up and walked into the parlor . Pelagie was sitting on the sofa between Emma and Eulalie . Under her black skirt another baby waited to be born , this one surely the last , for who would marry a widow with eight children ? At the sound of Miriam 's entrance the three women looked up . The mother and the sister spoke to each other without words : Why has she come here ? For a long minute Miriam and Pelagie waited . Unsteadily then , Pelagie stood up and Miriam rushed to her , opening her arms . Touched by the warmth of living flesh , together they mourned the dead and forgave the living . Even before she opened the envelope bearing David 's script and a New York postmark , the fear , which for the past month had lain like a cold stone in Miriam , broke apart . No one was at home when the letter arrived , so she was spared both the angry silences and the angry words that followed any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast enough ; from line to line her mind 's eye saw between each , written tall in flaming letters , the one word : Safe ! Safe ! " In the harbor we found a sailboat , " he wrote discreetly . For the first time in my life I had to take something that did n't belong to me . We cut the boat loose and turned downriver . Lu-  | cien is an excellent sailor and the wind was with us ; but for all that , they would surely have caught me . Five minutes later would have been too late , and I would not be writing this to you . We were only a few yards out when we heard shouts on the levee . Torches flared . There is a terror in the sight of so many torches on a black night . There must have been a dozen men , to judge by the lights and the voices . They did n't see us . It was mercifully dark on the water and the harbor was crowded with ships at anchor . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounding of my heart .. . ... and having neither food nor water , began to worry . Toward midmorning , coming into the old pirate lair on Barataria Bay , I decided to take a small chance and sent Lucien ashore to buy enough to last us through the long sail to Mississippi ... . So we passed between Cat Island and Pass Christian , remembering how you used to write about your summers at the Pass . I was afraid to put ashore there , thinking I might encounter someone who knew me from New Orleans . .. . ... finally landed at Pascagoula , where Lucien got hold of some back issues of the New Orleans papers , and so learned that Sylvain was dead , which , although I had hoped he was only wounded , I had actually suspected from the first . I took my terrible sadness and guilt with me on the train to Mobile , where we changed cars for the North . . . . Lucien keeps telling me that a man who kills in self-defense need feel no guilt , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am already back at work , having opened my little office yesterday . I hope my act has n't brought too much trouble to the family . Our poor father ! I seem doomed to keep hurting him . And you . I love you so and worry about you , who have troubles enough without my heaping more upon you . Forgive me . But I am the way I am ... . " I have a letter from David , " Miriam told Emma later that day . " Perhaps you will tell my father that he 's safe in New York . I ca n't talk about it anymore . " Later still Emma came to report . " He did n't say a word , but he looked very relieved . A father is a father , after all . " True . And the anger would pass . The pain might well last , but the anger would ease away . Ferdinand was not a man to hold on to it forever .  | Gabriel Carvalho closed the ledger with a smart thud and leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarterly accounts of Mendes and Company in the comfort of Rosa 's parlor , combining this business with Miriam 's social visit to Rosa . " So , " he said , " a job nicely done . Mendes is solvent . Very much so , I should say . " " Only because of you . " " Not so . You have caught on wonderfully well . " It was true . Miriam had astonished herself . With Scofield replaced by an honorable , bright young manager who had no objection to working with a Mrs. instead of a Mr. , she had " gone back to school , " as it were , and found it exciting . Having learned from Ferdinand 's failure and from Eugene 's prior example , she had as soon as possible paid off the debts which Scofield had piled up . Recently she had even begun to invest in real estate , prime vacant land alongside the railroad . Railroads will develop as the city grows ; they are bound to , she had thought . And Sanderson the manager had agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and stopped . It was far easier to express herself to Sanderson than to Gabriel . There was too much unspoken between herself and him : the affair with David , and Eugene 's taunt , retracted , it was true , but not forgotten by her : He ca n't take his eyes away from you . Absurd ! The truth was , he seldom looked at her at all ; when his head was n't bent over documents , his eyes were directed at the wall behind her head . She was quite certain that this behavior was not due to any shyness ; he was too positive to be shy ; rather , he was austere , kind but austere . One wondered whether he and any woman would  --  her thoughts stumbled , ashamed of themselves ? what he and a woman would . . . But with Andre it was all clear , all vivid ; one could imagine .  | " You were saying you had an idea . " She retrieved the idea . " Yes , I was thinking , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business ? He 'd have more incentive than one can have with just a salary . " " And I was thinking of suggesting that myself . You 're a step ahead of me . Soon I shall have to run to keep up with you . " " Oh , no , there 's so much I do n't understand ! All that business about bank stocks , Sanderson was trying to explain . " " Why they 're a sound investment ? Because banks have to be exceptionally strong in this economy . Planters need big loans to keep themselves afloat between harvests . " " But why is it so hard to keep themselves afloat ? " " They have to modernize . It costs money to run a plantation . A canegrinding engine alone costs five thousand dollars . Then there 're all the slaves to be fed . And the owners live lavishly . They spend from crop to crop . " " Creoles are so extravagant ! " " Not so much anymore . It 's not the Creoles , but the Americans , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightening their belts . Very few can recall the days of places like Valcour Aime 's Versailles . " " And a good thing , too . I was there once and it disgusted me . I remember how annoyed Eugene was because I was n't impressed . " Miriam paused , as if to make up her mind whether to speak or not . " I would like to sell Beau Jardin . I never liked it . " " Oh , no ! " Rosa cried . She had been working quietly at an embroidery frame . " Not that beautiful place ! " " Yes . I would like to free all the slaves and be rid of it . Every time I go there I despise it more . I drive past the fields where the people are working and I think , That woman there with the infant on her back was bought for a thousand dollars ; that man driving the mule wagon was bought for fifteen hundred dollars . ' And I can not stand it . " There was a silence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gabriel 's might also be disapproving , yet there was something about him that gave her full freedom to speak her mind . And she continued . " It 's hard to reconcile that feeling with the people I know so well . Eugene , after all , is not a villain . " " No , " said Gabriel , " he is not . " " He 's only like everyone else . Living here , he does what everyone else does . I understand that . "  | From the street a voice cried through the tall open windows , " Artichokes ! Figs ! Cantaloupes ! " " The Green Sass Man , " Rosa said . " Have you been buying figs from him , Miriam ? They 've been especially good this season . " " That old man , " Miriam said , ignoring the question , " has been buying his freedom as long as I 've known him . His master must make a good two or three thousand a year out of his sales . Oh , how I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , " What does Eugene say about selling Beau Jardin ? " " Of course he does n't see things my way at all . He wo n't hear of it . No one sees it my way except David , and even he writes to me now that we might need the place as a refuge when war comes . He 's become more and more pessimistic in the two years since he left . " " When war comes ! " Rosa cried . With pity Miriam thought , Her sons will have to go . " Yes , " she said , " David believes there is no stopping it . He says it 's only a question of when , not whether . " " Thanks to people like himself ! " Rosa cried sharply . " How clever he was all the time he was here ! Who could have had the slightest idea what he was doing ? " Her words cut the air . " It 's a wonder he got safely away . " " Feelings are very high . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miriam understood that this was a warning for her . " The other night at our meeting , our Jewish widows and orphans relief , some of the men almost came to blows . " " We Jews should stay out of politics , " Rosa pronounced . " We have enough of our own affairs to keep us busy . Look at that mess in the Albany Temple in New York , with the Orthodox fighting Rabbi Wise over women 's rights ! " She was out of breath with indignation . Miriam said , " I 'm sorry , I ca n't agree . " " Agitators on both sides are whipping people up too high , " Gabriel said soberly . " I go along with Isaac Leeser in the American Jewish Advocate . He thinks Jews ought to stay in the middle as peacemakers . " " It 's very hard to remain in the middle when you have convictions , " Miriam argued . " Have you read Uncle Tom 's Cabin ? David sent it to me from New York . It 's sold over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced at it , " Rosa said . " A sensational book , that 's all . It 's disgracefully exaggerated , and you must know that , Miriam . " " Probably so . Still , one often has to exaggerate to make a point . " Rosa 's voice became shrill . " I should think you 'd want to stay away  | from the miserable subject , Miriam . I understand you have convictions , but it seems to me you 've had enough trouble and should n't want any more . If you do n't mind my giving you some advice , I hope you do n't talk this way in front of your stepmother 's family . Frankly , I think it 's wonderful that they 've never humiliated you  --  not that it was your fault ? but still , he is your brother , and just seeing you must be a constant reminder . " " Of course you must know I do n't talk about these things except here , " Miriam answered with some heat . " Well , good , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery , while the North raises tariffs and enjoys all the financial benefits from it . " " Benefits ? " repeated Miriam , " Benefits . Money . " Gabriel intervened . " All the talk in the world wo n't change the fact that the system is bound to end no matter who wins . I say that over and over . " " Then you take war for granted ? " his sister cried . " The handwriting 's on the wall . The Republican party is being organized to oppose the extension of slavery into the territories . The next step is to eliminate it in the southern states . " Rosa was aghast . " And you think they have a right to do that ? " " No , I do n't think the national government has a right in law to do it . It 's meddling in business that belongs to the states . " " Then how , " asked Miriam , " would you eliminate slavery ? " " The states must do it themselves . And in time they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " In time , " Miriam repeated . " Meanwhile , " Gabriel said , " the law of the land is the law . " " Spoken , as David always used to say , like a lawyer . " She smiled , wanting to quiet the charged atmosphere . Gabriel did not return the smile . Instead he got up to stand with his hand on the back of a chair . He spoke softly , musing , as if to himself . " Sometimes I wish I were n't a lawyer at all . I wish I were a musician or a mathematician , dealing in abstractions . Everything quite clear and clean . I 'd erase " ? he made a broad , harsh gesture ? " I 'd erase everything emotional . Just facts , just facts . " He looked out of the window where a bee buzzed in the dangling wisteria . " And sometimes I think I 'd like to strike out to California  --  not for gold , I 'm not interested in that , just for something new . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A faraway smile fled across his face . He might have been feeling  | himself at the prow of the Sea Witch in high seas and gusting wind . " It set a record , you know : ninety-seven days from New York to San Francisco . " He broke off to rest a hand on Rosa 's shoulder ; she had been looking anxious . " Do n't worry , I sha n't abandon you yet , not till I see your boys grown and on their way . " " Then let 's talk of more cheerful things , " Rosa responded . " All right , my dear . You begin , " said Gabriel . " Well , " she said brightly , " is either one of you planning to hear Le Roi David ? I heard it once . Such lovely music ! Imagine that boy , only fifteen years old ! Louis Moreau Gottschalk . His grandfather was some sort of cousin to Henry 's mother , I think . " Every prominent or prosperous Jew , no matter where from , turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miriam thought with amusement . " That 's a cheerful subject . And I do plan to hear it . Now I shall leave you ladies to go on talking of cheerful things , " Gabriel said as he left them . " I like your hat , " Rosa said by way of reconciliation . " I 've given all my bonnets away . Only old ladies wear them anymore . Yes , the hat 's becoming . But you look tired . Not bad , mind you , but I 've seen you look better . If you ask me , you 're working too hard . " It is the work that saves me , Miriam thought , not answering . If it were not for the work , I should be completely without use or purpose . Rosa filled the teacups . " How do you like my new decorations ? You have n't said . " On a trip to the Crystal Palace Exhibition in New York , she had fallen in love with the Belter style . She had refurbished the old parlor with plaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chairs , covered in a pattern of golden bees on blue satin , stood around a large table topped with white marble . Carved flowers , grapes , and unicorns covered every inch of woodwork , and from the four sides of the room , tall mirrors reflected all this glory . " You do n't like it ? " Rosa inquired , continuing before Miriam could reply , " You can be frank with me . No , you do n't care for it , I see that . It 's not your taste . Perhaps it is a bit show-offy , but I had to have it . I 'm happy in this room . " " That 's all that matters , then , " Miriam said gently . " After all , one has to have something . I live alone , do n't I ? My brother and my sons are wonderful to me , goodness knows , but still , I 'm alone . " " Forgive me for asking , but I believe we 've known each other long  | enough and well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a woman as lively as you does n't marry again ? " Rosa set the teacup down with a click . She looked significantly at Miriam . " For the same reason my brother does n't . " " Why does n't he ? " " We 're all the same in our family . If we ca n't have what we want , we do n't take second best . You remember , I told you once . " " Ah , yes . He was n't Jewish . " " Was n't . Is n't . " " He 's still living , then ? " " Yes , and he would still have me . He 's wonderful , but I ca n't do it . Of course , if I should find another man of my own faith , as good a man as Henry  --  but I have n't , and as I said , we do n't take second best . " " And you say it 's the same with Gabriel ? " " Not exactly the same . You mean you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See what ? " " That he has never loved anyone but you . " Rosa regarded her with a curiosity that was almost prurient . " He could never obligate himself to another woman while he felt like that about you . " Unlike that old lingering taunt of Eugene 's , this apparently was fact , and it was stunning . " Gabriel has told you this ? " Miriam whispered . " Let 's say I wormed it out of him . " Immediately , then , Miriam thought of Andre . That some other man should be entranced by her as she was  --  no , as she used to be  --  by Andre ! Suddenly Rosa was alarmed . She clapped her hand to her mouth . " You wo n't dare let him know I 've told you ? I do n't know why I do these things . It just slipped out . I swore I 'd say nothing . He was sorry after he 'd said it and I promised him I 'd never tell . " " Trust me , Rosa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would bring up such a subject with Gabriel ? " " Oh , dear heaven , what an awful conversation this has been ! Let 's talk about something else quickly so we can forget it . Tell me some gossip instead . " " I do n't know any . I do n't hear much since I 've been spending afternoons at the office . " " Well , I know a bit . Andre Perrin is finally coming home . What do you think of that ? I was beginning to think they had settled perma-  | nently in Paris . But I hear he did n't get his money out of that beautiful house in the garden district . Such an extravagance , to build it and never use it ! " So Rosa chattered on about the new neighbor across the street and the rabbi 's wife and the dressmaker 's charges . But Miriam , nodding or shaking her head in the right places , was only half with Rosa , the rest being divided , torn between forces of home and children , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of Andre , who was coming home , having perhaps forgotten her entirely . And if he had not forgotten her , what then ? Presently , she got up and left . The carriage was waiting at the door . " Maxim , " she said , " there 's some property I want to see before we go home . " And she directed him to the garden district . Past Urania , Thalia , and Euterpe streets they drove , past towers , stained-glass windows , and serene lawns . It was a different world from that of the Vieux Carre  --  an American world . " Here , Maxim , stop here for a minute . " It had been a long time since she had seen the house . With a queer sense of satisfaction she noted how it differed from the others on the street . White and classical , it stood apart in an airy grove of mimosa trees . For a few minutes she sat in the carriage just looking at it , at a child who ran around from the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which lace curtains hung in what must be a lovely room , where a man and woman slept together . The horse flicked its tail and stamped , recalling her to herself . " Home now , Maxim , " she said . " Very pretty here , Miss Miriam , " Maxim observed , feeling chatty . " I had to go past Adele Street this morning for Miss Emma . She had an errand . You would n't believe it 's the same city as this , with the slaughterhouse and all the smells . Those Irish sure is dirty people . " Everyone wanted to look down on someone else . Maxim in his fine suit , driving his owner 's fine carriage , could feel himself superior to any poor Irishman who had no fine suit , no fine carriage , and no master to provide him with either . Curious indeed . Ferdinand and Emma were having coffee on the verandah . " You stayed a long time , " Ferdinand said . " Yes . Rosa and I talked after the business was over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long " out of things , " he was eager for every crumb of news , however unimportant it might be .  | " Oh , religion , home furnishings , war ? " " War ! " Ferdinand was indignant . " There 'll be no war . We left all that behind in Europe . " " Gabriel thinks there will be . So does David . But , " she ventured boldly , " I do think if women were to run the world , there would not be . We 'd find other ways to solve things . " " Women , my dear ? " Ferdinand gave his daughter the same smile he gave to little Eugene and Angelique . " Women ? Surely , if man with his strength and intellect ca n't manage affairs any better , what makes you think women can ? Why not entrust affairs to children while you 're about it ? " And who has been keeping this house together since Eugene lost his sight and you lost your money , she thought angrily . Vain , ignorant man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with such pathetic bravado . Let him talk , she thought , and did not reply .  | Now in autumn a cooler breeze swept in from the Gulf , and the sun , ceasing to scorch , poured out a benevolent warmth . In the side garden where Miriam sat with an unread book , the first yellowing leaves lay on Aphrodite 's shoulder ; on the dry grass an overripe persimmon fell , splashing its sweet thick juice , to which at once a bee came buzzing in a perfect frenzy . The gate clicked . Mildly vexed by the intrusion , she turned to see who the intruder might be . " Miriam . I 've just arrived . I came as soon as I could , " said Andre . So often in imagination she had contrived this meeting , fancying a chance encounter on the street or at some formal , drawing-room occasion , or even , foolishly , a tryst in a forest as in a German opera  --  always toying with such fancies and discarding them , embarrassed at their futility . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she felt other than dull wonder that he was there at all . " So much has happened to you since I went away . . . . Your brother . Oh , Miriam , in my heart I cried for you . " " And you knew about Eugene ? " " Yes , long ago . Emma wrote to Marie Claire . " " Marie Claire " hung in the air between them . " And how is she ? your wife ? " Whether in the saying of the name there was any sharp intent to hurt either him or herself , she could not have said . " She has n't come with me . She has had some recitals . Her teacher is enthusiastic . Well , at any rate , she wants to stay there a while longer . " So they are drawing apart , she thought maliciously , and was ashamed of the thought . " But I had to come back . I 'd been away long enough . We 've taken a house in the Pontalba Building . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | These perfunctory remarks  --  what did they mean ? He looked the same , with the same brightness about him . Did he remember their parting here in this place , how they had clung to one another ? Perhaps not . Time flows , changing , changing as each moment passes . " Would you like to see the house ? " Andre asked now . She had a need to walk , to move , to do something with the churning that was inside her . But she spoke primly . " That would be very nice . " With morning church over , the streets came to life as people streamed toward their Sunday amusements , the cock fights , the horse races , the minstrel shows , and the taverns . " This much has n't changed , I see , " Andre remarked . " I suppose the Protestants still fume over these merry Catholic Sundays ? " " I suppose they do . " " Well , I see no harm in amusing oneself , regardless of the day . Gloom never made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cathedral children clustered about the ice cream stand . " That has n't changed either . " " No , " Miriam agreed . They were making conversation . She felt the strain of stepping so gingerly around the only question of importance : Are we the same , or it have time and separation left their mark ? Andre remarked on the new cathedral . " A sumptuous building . " " Yes , thanks to the generosity of Judah Touro . " " We read about his will in Europe . Most extraordinary ! All those charities , the Jewish Hospital here , and orphan homes and help for the poor of Jerusalem . Remarkable . " ' " Gabriel says if Touro had died ten years ago he would have left nothing at all to any Jewish cause . Gabriel had great influence on him , you know . He was one of the people who brought him back to his faith . " " How is Gabriel ? Still not married ? " " Still not married . " In some odd way she felt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still more illogically , her very existence as the object of his love were her fault . And she went on , thinking aloud , " He has been a great help to me , a right hand since Eugene 's accident . "  | " Ah , but you 've had too many burdens ! " Andre exclaimed . " Far too many . " Pausing a moment before unlocking the door , he surveyed the square with obvious admiration . " Except for Andrew Jackson capering on his horse , one might think oneself on the Place des Vosges in Paris . " He led her upstairs into a tall salon with a Louis XV black marble fireplace . Automatically they walked to the windows ; in these rooms one would always walk to the windows . Below , in the square , crepe myrtle spread pink autumn flowers . To the right , one saw the levee and the glistening river . They stood quite still ; the silence ticked . What am I doing here ? Miriam thought . She began to speak in a high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lind arrived . P. T. Barnum brought her from Cuba . There were ten thousand people waiting . Such a crush ! She stayed here in the Baroness Pontalba 's house . " " Did she ? " Andre was behind her , not touching ; yet in the air around him there was an aureole of warmth which covered her back and shoulders . " Yes , " she said , " yes , she was here a month . They sold the tickets at auction for two hundred dollars and more . " The words rushed . " Perhaps Marie Claire will be like her someday . " Why speak of Marie Claire ? Andre replied , " Marie Claire has a pure voice , but it 's a little voice . She will never be a Jenny Lind or an Adelina Patti , although she does n't realize it yet . " " I 'm sorry , " Miriam said . The grave , plain child sang her heart out in Papa 's parlor . The drab young bride stood with Andre . Aunt Emma falsely chirped : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes . Sorry that she will not have what she wants so badly . It 's a terrible thing to want something you know you will never have . " " We did n't come here to talk about these things , " he said . She put her hands over her face . " I am all confused . I do n't know . " He laid her head on his shoulder . His fingers moved in her hair , loosening the sturdy pins , undoing the chignon at the back of her neck so that the slippery hair fell to her shoulders . Her heart slowed ; she could feel it pulsing steadily and strongly . Something rose in her that she had never felt before ; a flower opened and spread ; a river ran ; a wave lifted to a crest . His hands released the  | fastenings of her dress and she stood quite still , with closed eyes , allowing him to do what he wished . Wire hoops and twenty yards of yellow cloth fell to the floor . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale mauve mounds of her breasts swelling above the shift before it , too , fell . Her face was opalescent ; it swam in the mirror , the shadows under her eyes were like tear stains , while her lips turned upward slowly , slowly , into a wandering , gentle smile . Lightly he lifted her , easily carried her , and in a high , white lovely room , laid her down on the bed . Now his head rested on her shoulder . With her free hand she stroked his cheek , on which the thinnest ray of afternoon light , having slid through the drawn blinds , tipped the fine hair with gold . What a beautiful thing was his hand , with its fingers lying loose in sleep ! Each nail , smooth as glass , bore its pale crescent . Such tenderness , such skill in that strong hand ! In a wonderful languor she stretched her arm , smelling a lemon scent on her warm skin , feeling the bloom of her own health . A small quickening breeze swept in , waking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured . " No , I was drowsy , but I did n't sleep . " " You were thinking , " he reproached gently . " You think too much . " At this instant , at this reminder , anxiety shattered her peace . " I was remembering how often I wondered how it would be when you came back . " " Well , now you know . You do n't have to wonder anymore . " " I feel as if these years had n't passed at all , as if you 'd left only yesterday . " He kissed her eyelids . " I want you to be happy . . . happy . " " If only we never had to get up , if we could stay in this room like this . " " Dear Miriam , we 're here now , do n't spoil it . " " I do n't want to , but . . . " " But what ? " " If only there were no Eugene or Marie Claire ! " Two pairs of her stockings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a chair . They reminded her of  --  of Eugene 's woman . Am I then no better than she ? " You 're worried about them ? We 're taking nothing away that anyone wants . Certainly not Eugene , after all you 've told me. "  | " But Marie Claire ? " " It does n't matter , I tell you . She cares about her voice and nothing else , certainly not about me ! And if she does n't care , why should I ? " " Do you know , you probably wo n't believe me , but it 's true , I always saw my life touching hers one day ? " " Do you often see ' things ? " Andre teased . " Not often , " she said soberly . " But sometimes . For us I see only a blank , a dark blank . " " You 've listened too long to the servants . Superstitions . Listen to me . " He held her closely . " Always listen to me . Think of yourself going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guide , I 'll keep you safe , I 'll keep danger away . " She sighed . " You do comfort me . Even your voice comforts me . " " That 's what I want to do . " He kissed her . " You 'll come again ? I shall have to be away a great deal  --  my family 's place , and business in the North  --  but never for very long . You 'll come again ? " " Oh , yes , oh , yes I will . I will . " So it began .  | Now in the last year of peace there were some who saw what was coming and others who denied it , even though it was scrawled across the sky . John Brown had seized the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry . Hailed in the North as a defender of human liberty , he was daily condemned as a vicious agitator when merchants and planters met over lunch at Maspero 's Exchange . There they spoke , too , of men like David Raphael , wondering that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent a family . And they were sorry for his relatives . They quoted politicians who were saying that secession was inevitable unless some " reasonable compromise " could be effected and soon . In lowered voices and somber tones they spoke of Englishmen murdered in the Indian Mutiny at Lucknow only a few years before . The Mistick Krew of Comus organized a Mardi Gras parade that year as splendid as any ; the French Opera House opened with a spectacular season of Donizetti , Massenet and Bellini ; Adelina Patti sang ; the new gaslights were installed in the grandest houses ; and women , parting their hair in the center , madonna-style , had themselves photographed . Yet perhaps it was not ignorance but the fear of war which engendered this gaiety and roused Eugene from his indifference . " It 's too long since we had guests at Beau Jardin , " he said one day . He frowned . " Why have we not done it before ? " " We were conserving , " Miriam reminded him with some resentment . Not once had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 'll invite people in time for the grinding season . " That meant a week of lavish entertainment , of escorting visitors through the sugar mill , drinking hot cane juice and rum , while the slaves toiled twenty-four hours a day until the cane had all been ground . " We 'll bring everyone upriver on the Edward J. Gay , do it in fine style  | while we 're about it , " Eugene said . He became enthusiastic . " I shall want a fine menu , chowders and turtle soup , pigeons , whatever you can think of . And very likely we 're low on Madeira . It 's so long since I 've checked . Will you take care of that ? And the guest list , too , since ? since I ca n't write ? " She fetched pencil and paper . " We 'll begin with Gabriel and the sister . " " Rosa will be in Saratoga , " she reminded him . " Well , Gabriel , then . He 's a cool sort , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eulalie , Pelagie , and any of her children who want to come . Oh , yes , put Perrin down , Andre Perrin . I have n't seen him since he 's been back in town . He never comes to call ; you 'd think he 'd be more friendly . " Miriam 's pencil rested ; she controlled her trembling hand . " If he 's not that friendly , why invite him ? " " Oh , well , I 've no grudge . I do know he travels a good deal , so maybe that 's why he has n't come round . I always liked him , he 's clever , goes all over the world , which I wish I 'd done when I was still able . " " So he 's very likely away somewhere . I 'll find out for you . " " Do n't bother . I can find out myself . Put his name down . " Andre Perrin . The letters shaped themselves into spaces on the paper . They looked up quizzically , startled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piazza after dinner the men smoked and talked . The drone of their voices coming through the long open windows was in competition with the harp , which Pelagie 's daughter , Felicite , was playing in the parlor . Miriam 's thoughts moved like troubled wanderers looking for a place to rest . They moved from Angelique , who , pretending to be attentive to the music , was probably wishing she were as old as Felicite and could wear her hair up , back to Andre on the piazza . She strained to hear his voice among the others ' , but it did not come . After three days they had still not been alone together . Men and women bathed separately in the bayou . In groups they went driving through the countryside ; in groups they dined and played cards . Occasionally her eyes had met his ; then , remembering how Pelagie 's adoration of Sylvain had been so naked on her face , she had turned away . She thought curiously : Gabriel 's face is covered up . Nothing is revealed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course not . Then it  | must be very hard for Gabriel tonight .... How strange that two men who loved her should be sitting there together ! How strange to be having these thoughts at all ! She , Miriam , the proper-seeming wife of a respected gentleman ; the mistress of this family home , gleaming and orderly in its traditions ; the mother of that manly boy , already old enough to take his place with the men after dinner ; the mother to be an example for her daughter .. . What would the world  --  the world in which she had to live  --  say of her if they knew ? Her children . . . she would stand shattered before them . How they would suffer ! And she passed her hand over her perspiring forehead . " I 'm thinking , " Pelagie remarked , " of how Marie Claire used to play for us . It 's so strange that she stays abroad . It must be very hard on a young husband . " " I suppose it must be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looks very well , do n't you think so ? " " Very well . " " And you do , too , Miriam . I do n't know when I 've seen you so blooming , so healthy and pink . " Miriam moved closer to the window , giving as excuse the heat , but needing really to remove herself from Pelagie 's remarks . " I have enormous respect for Rabbi Wise , " Gabriel was saying . " He feels religion and politics ought to be separate and I agree . " " Well , Wise , " Eugene replied , " Wise is against slavery , and of course I do n't agree with him there . But when he says he 'd rather break up the Union than go to war , there I do agree . " " There 's no question that if war comes , it will be the abolitionist Protestant preachers who brought it about . " Miriam recalled a time when she had thought constantly about those questions ; yet at this moment they meant nothing ; she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fixed idea . " I 'm told that at the State House they predict crisis , " Eugene was saying . " They say if a Republican is elected President we shall secede . " Another voice was heard . " Then there will be war . " Other voices joined . " We are short of everything : wagon factories , ammunition , tents , everything . " " Can you imagine abolition here ? It 's enough to make your flesh crawl ! Hordes of them taking to the roads with no place to go , nothing to eat , except what they can steal . "  | She felt a touch on her shoulder . " It 's a perfect night , " Andre said . " Too beautiful for such depressing conversation . Would you like a walk or a row in the skiff ? " She raised her eyebrows , as if to say , We ca n't do this . But Andre countered lightly . " Any lady who wants to come is welcome . The boat holds two . Shall we take turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miriam 's chair scraped abruptly as she stood up , reminding her how he had drawn her away from the talk on that very first night . " We started out so cheerfully , " Andre said . " But they always turn to politics . Let 's look at the stars . They 've been here long before there was a North or a South and will be here long after . " The moon , faintly red , bled pink into the white sky . In the middle of the lawn where the decorous sound of the harp almost faded out of hearing , it was met by the poignant thrum and twang of a guitar . Over in the cabins a man was singing of ancient longings and transient delights ; one needed no words to recognize both longing and delights . On and on Andre and Miriam moved with identical steps . She felt the motion of his legs in unison with her own . The path to the bayou was thick with a hundred years ' worth of fallen pine needles , on which feet made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Live oaks spilled streamers of gray moss like old women 's hair . " The moss is sorrowful , " Miriam said . Andre was not to be drawn into her mood . " To begin with , it is n't moss at all . It 's related to the pineapple family , and that 's the symbol of welcome . " He helped her into the boat . So still was the surface that the trees along the shore made a motionless reflection , scalloping a deeper black against the opaque bayou water . Andre dropped the oars to let the boat drift and took her hand . For a long time they sat without speaking , joined by the tightening contact of their hands . " I wish there were someplace for us to go tonight , " Andre said . She dared then to say what she had been holding back . A woman should never take the initiative ; a woman should wait to receive . " I wish for more than tonight . To see ahead . " And when he did not answer , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we going ? " " Ah , do n't ! I ca n't bear it when you 're unhappy ! Listen to me . Remember that every day brings something new . When we first saw each other you were choked with tears . You could n't have foreseen , that night , what 's happened between us since then , could you ? "  | " That 's true , " she admitted . " I 'm not a superstitious man , but I 've seen so many curious and wonderful turns and twists that I never give up hoping . " He stroked her hair . More than his words , his fingers calmed her . His compassion made her want to believe that in some miraculous turn of affairs all impediments between them might be swept away . Presently he took the oars and turned the boat back to the landing , soothing all the while in his bright vigorous voice with talk of New York and Washington , of theater and amusing personalities . They walked back up the path toward the house . In deepest shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stopped and he pulled her to him . She trembled and , leaning against him , gave him all her weight , so that , half lifted , her feet barely grazed the ground and she was held to him by arms and lips . At last he said , " I have n't told you , I have to go north again next week . " " Again ? Must you ? " she cried , thinking , I sound like a wife . I cling like a wife . " I have to . I have business that has to be taken care of quickly . The war is coming , you know . I could n't stand any more talk of it inside there tonight , but they 're right , it 's coming . " " And who will win ? " " Who can say ? The North has more men and more money . The South will have help from Europe because of cotton . But who can say ? " All thought of issues and principles , all private secret allegiances , washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She controlled her voice . " How long will you be gone this time ? " " It depends how things work out . A couple of months maybe , but I 'll be back , you may be sure of that . Meanwhile , when you pass the Pontalba , think of me , remember that the place is waiting for us . Do you promise ? " She understood that he was aware of her fear and that he would admire her for covering it up with gallantry . " I promise , " she said . " Good ! Then , let 's go inside . " The brush raked her hair , snapping sparks . Through the mirror she saw the bed waiting and thought with relief that she would be asleep when Eugene came in after a late night at cards , so that she would not even be aware of his entry . How many thousands of hours they had lain  | together in the dark intimacy of that bed without touching ! And she thought that , but for the constraint of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  so natural and simple for Andre instead of Eugene to walk through that door and lie down in that bed . Someone knocked . " Come in , " she called , expecting Fanny . It was Eulalie . Her skirts flounced through the door with such speed that the taffeta crackled . At once she began to speak , like a child who had run to deliver a message and dared not forget it . " I want you to know that I saw you ! I saw you and him tonight . I heard every word you both said . " Miriam 's heart slowed . A heart was supposed to beat faster from shock ; nevertheless , she felt hers beat slowly , felt its hard pulse pounding . She laid the brush down and waited . " I was sitting on the lawn when I heard your voices quite clearly on the path . I certainly did n't stoop to eavesdropping , if that 's what you 're thinking , " I 'm not thinking anything . " Cool . Icy cool . Say as little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that you 're terrified . " I think , " Eulalie said , clipping the words , " that you are a disgrace . A disgrace . " A spray of her saliva struck Miriam 's cheek . " Perhaps there is n't enough decency in you to know that you are . " Miriam collected her thoughts , " If you choose to misunderstand ? completely misunderstand  --  what you say you heard , then there 's nothing I can do about it , is there ? " Eulalie 's laugh was the victor 's laugh , scornful and careless . " There 's nothing to misunderstand , The Pontalba ! So that 's where you go on your afternoon walks , the fine lady with  --  with gold bracelets ! " She will cry this through the house and over the city . My children will hear of it and hate me . " No wonder they moved the state capital away from New Orleans ! A modern Sodom , they said . Not fit for legislators , they said , and it 's true when women like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment Eulalie had no more words . There is a streak of madness in her , Miriam thought , as the red flush , like a burn or a disease , stained the woman 's neck , Perhaps it was that , before all else , that had kept the young men away : a streak of madness . " What do you think your father will say , your father who thinks the  | sun rises on you ! And my mother , who has treated you like one of her own daughters ! And this is how you repay them ! " Now I have gone as far as I can go in this life of mine , they will do what they want with me . Still she held on . " Is that all , Eulalie ? Really , there 's no point in continuing this , since you have made up your mind , " " Do you know what people will think of you ? That you 're a  --  a whore ! Yes , a whore ! " Surely this is the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . She stood up and slapped Eulalie with a light , humiliating sting . " Do n't use that word to me ! What do you know of whores ? Or of love ? Or anything else ? You hate the world ! You 're a poisoned woman , you hate yourself . You 've been my enemy from the day I came to your house . I was a child , but I knew it even then . So now you 've got a weapon ! Well , do what you want with it , I ca n't stop you ? " " I could hear you at the end of the hall , " Eugene said furiously . " What the devil is going on ? " Suddenly the walls revolved and the floor tilted upward . " I need air , " Miriam said . She stumbled to the verandah ; she could hardly speak . " Eulalie will be glad to tell you what 's going on . " From below came the sound of music and the voices of men still at cards . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few minutes had done . She thought again of her children . They were Eugene 's children ; he could take their mother out of their lives ; the law said so . Life has its way of surprising us , Andre had told her tonight . Float with its current , it 's easy , he had told her . But this current could dash her to pieces on the rocks . And that hard beat of her heart resumed . How long could a heart beat like that without failing ? Later  --  how much later ? Ten minutes , half an hour ? ? she became aware that Eugene was alone in the room . " You can come back in now , " he called . " Sit down . " She was thankful that he could not see , for she knew that terror was written on her face . " Well , " he began , " that was quite a story ! Quite ! The woman 's a poor , sneaky creature , but still I suppose she could hardly have invented it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could not bear to look at him ; instead , she looked down at her nails , the pink shells of her innocent nails . She sighed . " It 's true . " And she waited for his fury . Instead , the door to the hall , which had been ajar , was flung wide open and the children came in . My God , she thought , he has told them already ! Or he will tell them . He will condemn me in front of them , and they will despise me . They will be disgraced . No man of family will want to marry Angelique . In the temple on the Sabbath people will turn to stare  --  Her mind raced , aching like a winded runner . " Mama ! " cried Angelique . " Why have n't you been downstairs ? They 're playing the piano , and we 've been dancing ! " The child 's vigor illuminated her skin so that it glowed like ivory . " Mr. Perrin has been teaching me to waltz , he says I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris ! " " Does he indeed ? " said Eugene . Tensed for his next words , Miriam expected storm . But he only summoned the child to himself . " Come here , Angelique . " He smoothed her shoulders . " Lace . What color is it ? " " The lace is white , of course . My dress is blue . " " Very pretty , I 'm sure . We must get you a velvet one for the holidays . And have you been dancing , too , Eugene ? " The boy assumed a manly air . " No , that 's for girls . I do n't dance . " His father laughed . " That 's right . First learn to ride and shoot . I must remember to find a good gentle mare for you . You 're outgrowing the pony , Blaise tells me . Yes , you 'll have time enough for dancing . Now , both of you , go to bed . And close the door behind you , please . I suppose , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your children gave you quite a fright just now , did n't they ? " Miriam had sunk into a chair with her face in her hands . " You expected me to rage . " Eugene 's voice was light , almost amused . " Remarkable ! You surprise me ! I 'd have sworn you did n't have enough blood in you ! Andre Perrin . A handsome fellow , or was when I could still see . But I should have thought Carvalho more to your taste . I believe I told you so once , did n't I ? No ? " This mockery was worse than a righteous , angry assault . So lightly does a cat play with a fluttering , shrieking bird before he kills it . " On the other hand , " Eugene reflected , " Carvalho 's moral code would never allow him to tinker with another man 's wife , however  | tempting . Too bad ! It would be so much less complicated . He 's a solid citizen , he stays in one place , whereas the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of the fact that he has a wife , even though she is four thousand miles away . " " Oh , my God , tell me what you 're going to do and get this over with ! " " What did you think I was going to do ? Play the outraged husband ? Make a dramatic scene before the children ? Put you out of the house ? " She could not answer . " So ? I 'll tell you what I 'm going to do . I 'm not going to do anything . " Miriam looked up in disbelief . " Oh , of course , I could easily do any of those things . After all , the law 's on my side , the whole society 's on my side . But I do n't choose to . I 'm not that much distressed , not that concerned . You see , I probably understand more about the world than many men do . " Yes , you ought to , you with that woman ... . " My one concern is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . Your son and daughter have a distinguished name , two centuries old , and nothing must soil it . " " Then they wo n't ever know ? Ever ? " " Certainly not . They will grow up with dignity and standing . They are all I have . All I ever will have , " he added bitterly . The breathless thudding of Miriam 's heart began to dwindle . Thank God , oh , thank God . Then she felt a queer and totally unexpected moment of compassion : The man gave care to velvet dresses and gentle mares . . . . But  --  Eulalie , she thought next . The fear came stabbing back . " Eulalie ? " The name came out of her mouth with a quaver . " Eulalie is to keep still . Permanently still . Actually , I 've nothing to threaten her with , but I 've threatened her , all the same . She respects me , she 's maybe a little afraid of me . She will say nothing , you can be sure of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room as it had used to do . " Perrin , of course , will leave here in the morning . " " In the morning ? " " What did you expect ? I do n't want him in my house ever again . A man has that much pride where his wife is concerned , even when he lives the way we do . But the world does n't know how we live , and no man is going to make an ass of me before the world . "  | " Will you  --  is there going to be trouble between you ? " " I 'm blind , remember ? If I were n't , there would be plenty . " Eugene gave a scornful whistle . " And if it were n't pitch dark night , and if I were n't a gentleman , I 'd throw him out right now . But he 'll be gone before you come downstairs in the morning . You understand that ? " " I understand . " " And that his name is not ever again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed , and do n't snivel and toss all night . I want to sleep . " She did not " snivel , " nor did she toss . Instead , she lay still with her hands folded between her breasts until , suddenly remembering that this was the position in which a corpse was laid , she brought her hands down to her sides . The midsummer air was thick and blue , hard to breathe , but she drew on it deeply , forcing it into her lungs , clenching her fists , forcing courage . She must try to separate her feelings , to put some order into a murky tangle of despair . There was the aftermath of fear . There was the frustration of being at the mercy of the despised and pitiable Eulalie . Yes , and loneliness , looming and towering ahead : never to see Andre again ? Never ? And shame : Would I want my daughter to do what I have done ? No . I want her not to have to do it , not to need to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the most recent of her brother 's hortatory letters , each with its message meant to inspire , but which succeeded only in arousing a futile restlessness . He had a new cause : women 's rights . He had enclosed a sheet of clippings about Ernestine Rose , rabbi 's daughter , abolitionist , and vigorous champion of women 's rights . Indeed there had been fury in her speeches , searing , unforgettable phrases : " A slave from the cradle to the grave . . . Father and husband , master still . . . The right to her person , her property , and her children . " They had everything to do with Miriam , these searing phrases . And at the same time , as she lay there in the stifling dark , they had nothing to do with her . It would be better , she thought bitterly , if David would stop his bombardment of ideas . What did he expect her to do , leave home and go out preaching ? Eugene stirred , mumbling in his sleep . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andre , too , slept . Long before first light Miriam got up and with soundless steps went out to the verandah . The chill that precedes dawn raised prickles on her arms and shook in the trees . A lone bird twittered and was still . Silent ,  | mysterious , gloomy woods and fields lay in the muffling darkness . But for once they held no fear ; no crawling things or swooping things or human enemies could threaten out there ; fear and threat lay inside this house . And that old wish , the one she had felt on the first sight of this place , came surging back : to strike out across the fields , through the woods , over the hills , and go . Suddenly dawn broke . The sky exploded with light . Cascades of amethyst and scarlet sprayed upward from the rim of the earth , scattering into shreds of lavender and tender pink . And now a choir of birds in fullest song gave proper praise to this magnificence . But one small wounded creature saw nothing in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its own small heart . Miriam was still standing there when the front door opened below and Andre came out . Without a backward look he stepped into the waiting carriage and was driven away .
