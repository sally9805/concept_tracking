txt IN 1916 , U.S. trade with the Soviet Union totaled $479 million . That was the high for the next 56 years . Now some businessmen and analysts wonder if trade between the two nations will revert to such a modest level . In the wake of President Carter 's currt on grain sales to Russia and his tempo . racy ban on high-technology exports , experts say it could be some time before U.S.-Soviet trade returns to the pitch of the last several years , when total annual exports to Russia have been as much as $3.4 billion . Just how long It will take to restore U.S.-U.S.S.R. trade to its recent high levels is a matter of debate . " I really think we 're done in terms of trading with the U.S.S.R. , " said Robert Russell , counsel for Sen. Stevenson 's ID. , I.11.1 Senate International Finance Subcommittee . " I think it will be 50 years before we resume trading with Moscow , except for grain . " FRED HUSZAGH disagreed . " I do n't see us foregoing those markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Dean Rusk Center , which analyzes international trade . " I see us trying to normalize those relationships as quickly as possible . " And many businessmen would n't guess about the future , including Charles Levy , vice president of the Emergency Committee for American Trade . " I think probably there are only half a dozen people in the United States who know how long it will last , " he said . For now , U.S. grain exports to the Soviet Union will be limited to the a million metric tons a year specified under a five-year agreement that expires next year . AND EXPORTS OF high-technology products to Russia  --  items ranging from oil-drilling hits to computers  --  will he halted completely for four to six weeks while U.S. export policy is reviewed . When those shipments are resumed , the new rules seem sure to place much more stringent limits on what technology is allowed into Russia . Nearly anything that could remotely be put to military use is likely to be banned . Carter 's action was in response to Russia 's invasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than the Soviets . While taxpayers foot a $2.25 billion bill to support the price of grain and protect shippers from huge losses , Russia may make up the missing 17 million metric tons by getting U.S. grain through communist block or third-world nations , some government officials say . AND WHILE American firms recover from lost technological business , possibly with more government aid , the Soviet Union will shop the international technology market for replacements that experts say wo n't be very hard to find . Most trade affected by the embargo springs from the early days of detente , when the Nixon administration , fostering better Soviet relations , worked to improve trade . Beginning with a massive grain sale in 1972 , U.S. exports to Russia have grown markedly from the pre-detente level of $217 million in 1971 , with interruptions only for short-lived embargoes not as sweeping as the one announced last week . The tightness of the trade limits led to worries about the future of U.S.-Soviet trade . " I think exports to Russia will go to zero , " said Russell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to happen . " WHEN AND IF the embargo Is lifted , Russia 's demand for U.S. grain and technology might be diminished , both from its forging of new trade alliances during the embargo and from wariness of another cutoff . The latter reason might also dissuade American businesses from becoming too deeply involved in Soviet trade arrangements , Huszagh said . " Companies like Control Data or Sperry Univac will not make the kind of investments there like the Germans or Japanese have as long as there is national security adviser 7higniewl Brzezinski or someone like him using trade as a weapon , " Huszagh said . Others were also critical of the use of the embargo as retaliation . " There are doubts among American businessmen that a policy of using trade as a weapon is going to be effective , " said Scott Ai ken , a spokesman for Armco Inc. , whose recently announced $353 million joint venture with Japan 's Nippon Steel Corp . to build an electrical steel mill in the Soviet Union was left up in the air by the embargo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold on technology , " he added . " There are just any number of people who can supply this kind of competence and equipment . " Robert Molder , spokesman for the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association , also criticized use of an embargo as a foreign policy tool , saying , " What we 're doing by restricting exports of American equipment Is enlarging foreign suppliers ' markets and giving them a foot in the door . " Huszagh predicted that as businessmen , farmers , and the American people see what they have lost because of the embargo , " They are really going to rattle their cages " for a trade resumption . At the same time , despite finding other suppliers , Russia will want to renew trade with the U.S. , Huszagh says , because " by using U.S. products , you get a better feel of who the enemy is . " MOREOVER . HE added , the Russians " are always going to be , in a number of areas , consumers , rather than suppliers , of their own needs . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole Soviet bloc as a trading entity , " he said . " It 's a big market . "
