In the 1960s , vocations for priests and nuns wavered and plummeted as the Catholic Church underwent profound change . Entire seminary classes graduated without a single ordination . Now plays , books and movies ranging from " The Thorn Birds " to " True Confessions " are re-examining the struggles of faith within the priesthood and the nunnery . " The timing ' s right . It ' s like Vietnam . People had to sit on it for a while before they wanted to talk about it , " said Mary Gilligan Wong , an ex-nun and one of two authors who visited Boston recently to recount personal storiesfrom that era . Wong , author of " Nun , " and Paul Hendrickson , whose book is titled " Seminary ; A Search , " were part of the baby-boom bumper crop of aspiring priests and nuns in the ' 50s that swelled enrollments in Catholic prep schools and high school-level seminaries to record levels . They and other teenagers were isolated from society and prepared for the vows of " poverty , chastity and obedience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never experienced . Hendrickson calls it " the kiddie ministry . " Given today ' s climate of teenage sexual activity , consumerism and spiritual uncertainty , Wong ' s and Hendrickson ' s documentations of growing up in this vanished region of Roman Catholicism before The Second Vatican Council read as exotically as reports from Atlantis . Paul Hendrickson has pink glasses , silver hair and sensitive , boyish features . He ' s likable and insightful , with a preference for questions over answers . One can ' t help thinking he would have made a compelling priest . His superbly written book , " Seminary ; A Search " ( Summit Books ) , is suffused with a sense of loss and nostalgia . The search referred to in the title is his effort to discover why , now that he ' s happily married and a successful writer for the Washington Post , his years in the seminarycontinue to haunt him . " Wherever I go , almost whatever I do , I find that the seminary comes softly clacking along behind , like a child ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he attended for seven years , like hundreds of others , no longer exists . Of his class of 20 at the Missionary Servants of the Most Holy Trinity in backwoods Alabama , only one is currently a priest . For good Catholic boys in Hendrickson ' s Illinois home town 30 years ago , becoming a priest was the highest calling ( and the surest way to make a devout mother proud ) . " We were the best and the brightest , " he recalled in a recent interview . They were also among the youngest . At the tender age of 14 , Hendrickson and his classmates left home , except for summer visits , for 13 years of gruelling preparation for the priesthood , surrounded only by priests , aspiring priests and plaster saints . The assumption seemed to be that a boy would go bad unless he was sealed away from society . Life in the seminary , according to Hendrickson , was both rewarding and bizarre , combining the primitive exuberance of a spartan boys ' summer camp with the self-denying mysticism of a medieval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I went to high school 400 years ago , ' " Hendrickson said . The boys ' days were ruled by bells - four dozen a day - regimenting 3 1/2 hours of prayer and 8 1/2 hours of study each day . Many of the boys went on to become outstanding scholars . Hendrickson credits the tough schedule with fostering his own drive for perfection and his ability " to beat 60 minutes out of an hour " - handy attributes for his current profession of newspaperman meeting deadlines . He also developed solid moral values that have stood up well over the years , he said . The truth is that Hendrickson loved the seminary . And yet , after seven years , a mere six months before professing his vows , he dropped out . So did almost all of the boys in succeeding classes . Ten years later , the seminaryclosed its doors . What happened ? " You can take a glass , fill it to the brim with water , rest a thin piece of cardboard on top , turn it over , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hendrickson said . " Then all of it will pour out . " He wonders if the rapid reforms of the 1960s and attempts to modernize the Catholic Church didn ' t result in the sudden unexpected collapse of some fundamental assumptions - that the Church could change , just like other institutions , and therefore was not already divinely perfect , just like other institutions . When Hendrickson left , after a year of spiritual wrestling , he was a wreck . It was four years before doctors took him off the medication that helped him through this period . In the two decades since , he has been in and out of a first marriage which he was emotionally ill-equipped to handle , has confronted his worries about homosexuality , and has pursued both therapy and a search for spiritual continuity . " On my best days at the Post , " the Pulitzer Prize nominee said , " my job is the tiniest bit priestly . I write something which produces some gleam of light in the world for the little old lady who reads it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p . ' " He has concluded , without bitterness , that leaving the seminary is the most positive moment of an overall positive experience . Mary Gilligan Wong also came from the Illinois heartland and entered a similarly intense prep school . Although she tells basicly the same story about the same period of time in her memoir " Nun " ( Harcourt Brace Jovanovich ) there are many differences between her telling and Hendrickson ' s . This is partly because they are different people . While Hendrickson projects sensitivity , Wong communicates stability . She ' s the kind of woman you wouldn ' t hesitate to leave your kids with . This is appropriate for someone whose choices in the narrow 1950s were between becoming a mother like her mom or a teaching nun like her aunt . As she watched her mother struggle with five children born at intervals of a year or two , Wong had little trouble seeing the convent as the more glamorous option . Also a product of the " kiddie ministry , " she responded to recruiting in her Catholic school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same early age , 14 , with similarly childlike motivations . After a bout of sibling rivalry , this was a way of being the " special daughter . " Wong followed her journey through to a conclusion , taking vows as a nun . She even had a hands-on role in helping to rewrite the rules of her order in the late 1960s . Unlike Hendrickson , Wong does not romanticize the Church or seem to miss the old days . She almost casually demystifies the convent , recalling the bread-and-butter customs of this sanctum sanctorum from which laymen were banned . ( However , she has fictionalized the name of her order and had a lawyer go over the manuscript . ) Living in a total institution , their personalities were hammered into self-denying humility . To foster submissiveness , novices had to ask permission before taking a drink of water at a fountain . Sisters were taught to dress under their nightgowns and even to forswear exercise , lest they pay too much attention to their bodies . Humility demanded that they constantly search their souls for faults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on every occasion . Wong counts herself among the last generation to have experienced it in its medieval form , and much of what she recounts no longer exists because of sweeping reforms . Perhaps because her 10 years with the order spanned a transitional period , her re-entry into the secular world seems to have been relatively serene and guilt-free . " It was like I ' d spent all those years in the woods with my girlfriends . When I left , it was a wonderful time of discovery . . . The people who suffered the most are those who left in the 1950s or early 1960s . They were the ones who were spirited out of the convent in the middle of the night with no goodbys . " When Wong left , she had plenty of support , and company . Her first lover was an ex-priest . There has been much reform in her old order . " Some of the nuns I ' ve met since are the gutsiest , most liberal women I know , " she said . She said the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuns adjust to the relative freedom and indepedence of the new rules . While Wong was a nun , the world changed , opening up more roles for women than existed when she entered . One of the benefits of the nunnery , she thinks , was that it preserved her options by keeping her from settling into a too- limiting marriage . " I avoided a lot of conditioning . I didn ' t have to spend hours waiting by the phone for some boy to call or picking out a dress for a date . " In contrast with ex-priests , who often have trouble adjusting to being " just a man " after their exalted status as priests , Wong has been wildly upwardly mobile in the eyes of society as an ex-nun . " I had much more power after I left , " she said . More money , too . Now a clinical psychologist with a private practice , Wong , her two children and her husband , another psychologist , have a house with an ocean view in Encinitas , a California neighborhood where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a BMW are parked in the garage . There are things she misses about being a nun , of course . The sense of community , a closeness to the seasons , meditative silence . But , she added , " The nuns I meet today are pretty busy , too . " Wong likes answers more than questions and has come to two conclusions . One is : " follow your heart . " The other : " To make a contribution to the world , you don ' t have to sacrifice . " Like Hendrickson , Wong is now only an occasional churchgoer and calls herself " a cultural Catholic .
