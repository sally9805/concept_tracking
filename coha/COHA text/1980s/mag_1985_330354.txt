" My parents are letting go of some of their ways , " insists Joo Hee Yoo , 13 , who came to Los Angeles from South Korea ten years ago . " They are beginning to understand that America is a place of freedom . " Maybe so , but the rules for Joo , who now goes by the name Jennifer , and her two younger sisters would strike many U.S. youngsters as unduly restrictive . No telephone calls to or from boys . No curling irons or pierced ears until age 15 . No hair spray and makeup until after high school . " When you are a student , you should look like a student , " says her mother Hae Sun Yoo . " That is hard to tell children when society contradicts that here . " She and her husband have the solution . " When our daughters complain , ' Why ca n't we do this ? ' we explain to them they are Korean , " says Hae Sun Yoo . But Jennifer is not totally swayed . Says she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an education . " <P> While other 18-year-olds agonize over which pretty dress or funky pair of shoes to buy , Juniace Sene Charles worries about " what this month 's electricity and water bill are going to be . " The petite teenager , who came to Miami with her mother , younger brother and sister from Haiti two years ago , is the family 's financial mainstay . Every day when classes end at Edison High School , she rushes to her job at Wendy 's on Biscayne Boulevard . Her take-home weekly salary of about $75 is augmented occasionally by her mother 's earnings from babysitting . " I 'm chief of the household , " she says . Juniace is fiercely loyal to her family , but determined to make her own life : " I 'm going to college , and I 'm going to be an agronomist . Here in America I can make it . " <P> Dressed in light cords and deck shoes , with sunglasses dangling from his sweatshirt , Son Nguyen , 18 , seems like any other carefree high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me today , she would be shocked , " confesses Son , who fled Ho Chi Minh City at age eight with a younger brother , his older sister and her husband . " I would n't be her boy anymore . I would be an American stranger . " Still , within the two-story brick house he shares with eight other people , Son becomes a model Vietnamese youth , industrious , responsible , deferential . In that household , Vietnamese is spoken , Vietnamese food is prepared , Vietnamese customs are followed . Son 's mother has not been permitted to leave Ho Chi Minh City , and after a decade of separation , he often wonders how he would greet her . With an exuberant American-style hug ? Or with a formal , respectful hello ? " I 'm so changed now , " Son says , " that if I faced her , I would n't know what to do . " <P> These conflicting tugs of direction are a perplexing constant in the lives of millions of youthful American immigrants . Growing up in two cultures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame and pride , guilt and satisfaction . It can be both a barrier to success and a goad to accomplishment , a dislocating burden or an enriching benison . First-generation Americans have an " astonishing duality , " declares Harvard Psychiatrist Robert Coles , himself the son of an English immigrant . " They tend to have a more heightened awareness both of being American and also of being connected to another country . "
