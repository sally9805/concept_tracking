May it be Thy will that the Temple be speedily rebuilt in our days . . . <P> That plea to God , recited three times a day in Jewish prayers , expresses a yearning that makes Jerusalem 's Temple Mount potentially the most volatile 35 acres on earth . Though 19 centuries have passed since Roman troops obliterated Herod 's gilded Temple , the Mount remains the object of intense Jewish reverence . But for the past 13 centuries the same trapezoidal tract has also been Islam 's holiest site after Mecca and Medina : its Al Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock honor the spot whence the Prophet Muhammad is said to have ascended to the seventh heaven . Christians too hold in awe this place where Jesus walked . Now a controversy has arisen over whether , and when , a new Jewish Temple should be built . <P> Temple reconstruction was no issue until 1967 , when Israel captured the Mount and the Old City . Eager to preserve peace , Israel continues to allow Muslims to administer the site . They permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , nor will they consider allowing even the simplest synagogue or church . The merest hint of rebuilding the Temple is considered an outrage by the Prophet 's followers , who , in the words of an official at Al Aqsa , " will defend the Islamic holy places to the last drop of their blood . " <P> Jewish sensitivities also hinder reconstruction . Israel 's Chief Rabbis forbid Jews to set foot on the Mount lest they accidentally step on the site of the ancient Holy of Holies , where only the high priest entered , once a year . In addition , there are various views over how and when a new Temple could or should be raised . The Babylonian Talmud offers conflicting opinions , but Rashi , the great medieval sage , insisted that the Temple must descend directly from heaven when the Messiah comes . On the other hand , tradition holds that God 's biblical command to build the Temple is irrevocable , and the Jerusalem Talmud says Jews may construct an intermediate edifice before the Messianic era . A 1983 newspaper poll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to rebuild ; a mere 3% wanted to wait for the Messiah . <P> Next week Israel 's Ministry of Religious Affairs will sponsor a first ever Conference of Temple Research to discuss whether contemporary Jews are obligated to rebuild . However , several small organizations in Jerusalem . believe the question is settled . They are zealously making preparations for the new Temple in spite of the doctrinal obstacles and the certainty of provoking Muslim fury . <P> These groups eschew violence but offer no explanation of what should be done about the Muslim shrines that now occupy the holy ground . They point out that animal sacrifices and other aspects of Temple worship are so ingrained in Judaism that they take up a third of the 613 biblical commandments , plus major portions of the Talmud and the daily ritual . Temple restoration is also a fixation for literal-minded Protestants , who deem a new Temple the precondition for Christ 's Second Coming .
