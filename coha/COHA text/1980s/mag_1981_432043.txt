 | Until a fortnight ago in San Diego , 15-year-old Elaine Zayak had never made a major mistake in competition . But during her two-minute routine at the National Figure Skating Championships , she actually stumbled during a triple-toe , double-loop combination to finish fifth in that part of the program . " When I put her to bed her eyes were red and swollen , " says Elaine 's mother . The youngster met next morning with her coach , Peter Burrows . " I want to add that jump to my routine tonight , " she told him . Burrows was incredulous . Adding the move would mean that Elaine would have to perform seven triple jumps in her four-minute program , something that no woman had ever accomplished . That evening Elaine put on an electrifying show , complete with the seven perfect jumps , and waltzed off the ice as the new U.S. women 's champ . " I had to show people that I just do n't miss , " she said later . And then she giggled . New Breed ' : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many superlatives to heap on the Paramus , N.J. , prodigy . Her predecessors were all quite different : Peggy Fleming was a graceful ballerina ; Dorothy Hamill , an athletic imp , and Janet Lynn combined the best of both . " But Elaine represents a new breed of skater , " says Burrows . " Physically , she 's very strong . She is capable of doing combinations that have never been done before . " Last year 's reigning queen , Linda Fratianne , managed only two triple jumps in her silver-medal performance at Lake Placid ; at the 1981 Nationals , thirdplace finisher Lisa-Marie Allen attempted only one ? and came crashing down on her knees . Now Elaine is working on a 31/i-revolution jump , which demands that the 5-foot , 2-inch tyke leap still higher to complete the move . " I want to be the next Olympic champ , " she says . It 's a ridiculously costly goal : the life of a figure skater is like self-imposed slave labor . Elaine must spend five to six hours a day on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a twentyminute drive from home . She must endure endless hunger pangs , or as her choreographer , Mary Lynn Gelderman , chided when Elaine broke off a bit of chocolate , " Over the lips , onto the hips .... Elaine , do n't . " But if she cheats on her diet , she never seems to let up on her work . " You work hard and get closer to a goal and there 's nothing you can do but keep going , " says Elaine . As for being cut off from normal teenhood , she scoffs , " Aw , kids just get into trouble . I can live without that ! " Like other adolescent sports stars , Elaine finds herself teetering between two worlds . Her physical ability has catapulted her prematurely into the adult world when right there , sitting on her bed , is " Le Monk , " an ancient stuffed monkey that must ? absolutely must ? be in the audience to watch her every competition . " There are times when we tell her she must skate one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Gelderman . " You can see the frustration on her face . Being a kid , she wants to be somewhere else . " Since her triumph in San Diego , the adult demands have intensified : appearances on TV , kids demanding her autograph , fan letters stacked on the kitchen table . When she was watching " General Hospital " one afternoon last week , the phone did n't stop , as one reporter after another inquired , " May I speak to Elaine , please ? " Asked how she feels about this attention , Elaine said with a grin , " I guess you can say I 'm on the top ... or whatever . " Then her eyes locked back onto the TV set . Elaine began skating in a typically casual way . Her mother had some shopping to do one afternoon and impulsively decided to drop off Elaine ? then 3 ? ? at an indoor rink . Soon Mrs. Zayak 's weekly indulgence became Elaine 's obsession . Private lessons began when she was 8 . The instructor decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished next to last . " Then she wanted to enter her in the Middle Atlantics that fall , " says Jeri Zayak . " I did n't want the heartbreak of another next-to-last finish . " Elaine came in fourth , and rose swiftly through the figure-skating ranks . At 13 she blazed into the senior levels , and a year ago she came from nowhere to finish fourth at the Nationals . " It was n't until I was 12 that I began to believe I really had a shot at being the best , " says Elaine . " Before that it was just a lot of fun and wanting to be like Sonja Henie , which , " she adds with a giggle , " I still do . " All the while , the expenses mount . Elaine 's father , Richard , runs a tavern and works seven days a week to help pay the bills . Ice time alone averages $4 an hour , or roughly $125 a week . The family must also pay for the coach and the coach 's expenses on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $25,000 to $30,000 annual expenditure is just part of the price . " The house needs painting and we ca n't afford it , " frets Mrs. Zayak . " Sometimes I worry about what our neighbors must think of us . " She also worries about her 16-year-old daughter , Cindy , who often is housebound while Mrs. Zayak chauffeurs Elaine around . " But what can we do ? " she says . " You ca n't just stop . " Elaine could recoup the expenses only by turning professional , but that 's a long shot ? and a long time away . Gamble of Nerves ' : The pace and the pressure will only grow . At the World Championships in Hartford , Conn. , next week , Elaine hopes to place in the top five . Then , until the 1984 Olympics , Elaine will have to defend her national title while trying to improve her world ranking . " Figure skating is a gamble of nerves , " says Peggy Fleming . " Elaine 's never had pressure before . " Fleming also wonders if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has lost that flow and grace that some other girls have , " says the gold medalist . " But it 's her style and it works for her . " Elaine has heard this before . " Nobody likes a winner , " she notes . " They said Dorothy was too fat and Linda did n't have any presentation . So I do n't have any style . Well I 'm not going to be made up and have a nose job . I 'm just going to be me , zits and all . " @#
