The phrase " inside the Beltway " has become a part of America 's political language , given a boost by Ronald Reagan and George Bush , who use it to explain why they succeed when the Washington policy elite says they will fail . <P> Commentators like James J. Kilpatrick toss out the phrase to register contempt for a federal complex preoccupied with its own navel . William Safire says the phrase connotes something " of interest to tea-leaf readers of Washington goings-on but ( is ) strictly a yawner to the World Out There . " Author Ben Wattenberg defines " inside the Beltway " as the " exponential expansion of what used to be the Georgetown cocktail party  --  elitism that has lost touch . " <P> The phrase is at once geographical and conceptual . The Beltway is a 66-mile highway that encompasses the District of Columbia and parts of Maryland and Virginia . Some 1.5 million people live within its confines , sustained by Government jobs , contracts , consultancies and the endless tasks of explaining and influencing the federal behemoth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America today , " says the President 's pollster , Richard Wirthlin , whose studies show these citizens far beyond the norm in education , income and political involvement . They are shielded from most economic shocks by the deep pockets of the U.S. Treasury ; the deficit may be alarming , but the Federal Government is not about to close down . Wattenberg found that during the 1980-83 recession , the number of practicing lawyers grew from 32,000 to 39,000 , trade association employees from 40,000 to 50,000 . <P> What really matters is the state of mind created by this superfunded environment . Reagan and his aides still see themselves as outlanders locked in a battle with legions of old liberal Democratic bureaucrats and bleeding- heart journalists who built Big Government and , in the words of White House Communications Director Pat Buchanan , " have n't been right about an important political issue since John Kennedy . They are out of touch  --  and frozen . " <P> " Ronald Reagan is King of the Beltway now , " counters Congressional Scholar Norman Ornstein . Reagan can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Ornstein insists that members of Congress are very much in tune with their own districts and states since they live and die on that political ground . <P> Yet even Ornstein confesses that something odd happens when all of this ambition and money come together in the 257-sq. - mi . Beltway cooker . Being the focus of national news creates an unwarranted sense of self-importance . Economic security diminishes sympathy and understanding . The concerns of Pittsburgh and Bakersfield and a thousand other places grow more and more remote . <P> Wirthlin is not surprised . He has found the same " cocoon " in corporate life , where a group of talented people gather their ideas from the same information base and debate them with one another day after day . In that situation , seedlings of misconception can often grow to mighty oaks before reality intrudes . <P> How the Beltway mind works was illustrated the other day when New York City Mayor Ed Koch came to Washington and dined with the resident media . He was chided about the comparative records of subway crime in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a master at . His voice rose like a buzz saw .
