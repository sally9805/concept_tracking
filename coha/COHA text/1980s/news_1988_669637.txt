' ' Thank you , ' ' we replied , and left the office , ecstatic over the prospect of a three months ' summer vacation abroad . The flight , at that moment , was somewhat incidental . However , Isabel said , as we walked up Nicollet Avenue , ' ' What do you suppose he meant by outside seats ? ' ' // // ' ' I ' ve no idea , ' ' I answered , ' ' but perhaps they are window seats ; I don ' t know anything really about planes , outside seats , or whatever. ' ' // We dropped the subject and in our enthusiasm over being in Venice , Rome , and Paris , we gave little thought to our transportation to London until the day of our flight. // That day dawned , rainy and tumultuous . We went by car to LeBourget Field , hoping the flight would not be canceled . For some time we sat in the small shed-like terminal waiting eagerly for decisions about weather and the flight . Finally a favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two young men , Americans , approached Isabel and me , saying , ' ' Are you the two girls who have the outside seats ? Because of the inclement weather , would you like to trade with us ? ' ' // A uniformed official was standing near and we asked him , ' ' What are outside seats ? ' ' // ' ' Seats in the nose of the plane , in front of the pilot and mechanics. ' ' // ' ' Would we have any protection from the weather ? ' ' // He said simply , ' ' I ' ll be with you in a minute . ' ' Returning , he had in his arms two sheepskin-lined coverall suits , two helmets , earmuffs , goggles . We gave one look at the equipment and told the inquiring Americans that we would keep our reservations . Then Mr. Chandler ' s words rang in our ears - ' ' excellent seats , outside seats on the plane from Paris to London. ' ' // I began unbuttoning my full-length leather coat , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official said , ' ' Keep your coat on . These coveralls go over your garments . ' ' He literally stuffed us into those airplane coveralls . All was well until we tried to walk . We simply could not lift our legs . We shuffled , two lumbering bears , dragging our feet through the mud , often slipping back two steps for every forward move . By the time we reached the metal ladder into the plane , locomotion was almost nil . Hanging onto the railing on each side of the ladder , we lifted ourselves , step by step , into the plane. // We steadied our shuffling gait up the inclined narrow aisle by holding onto the backs of the inside seats provided for the eight or 10 less fortunate passengers . Finally we reached the door to the open cockpit , and there saw the greatest problem of all . We would have to roll over the backs of the seats belonging to the pilot and the mechanic , then over the backs of the seats in the nose of the plane . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but enthusiasm and desire accomplished for us this almost insurmountable hazard . When after an awkward struggle we gained upright positions in our seats , we looked at each other triumphantly . I don ' t recall being strapped in . I do remember that we fitted into the nose of that plane without an inch to spare. // The pilot and mechanic took their seats and as soon as they saw that we had regained equanimity , the pilot instructed us to give him our handbags , which we wouldn ' t see again until we landed at Croydon Field , London . He explained the necessity for this regulation since each of us had , for a close neighbor , an engine and a propeller . If anything got loose , it could easily fly into the propeller and cause an accident . One thing we were sure about was that we wouldn ' t get loose . Our heads and shoulders swiveled , but there was no room for body motion. // Then we were off . There was no discomfort in the ascent or at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first the nose of the plane worked its way along a ravine-like opening between two gray-black cloud cliffs , precipitous walls that hugged both sides of our little plane . Companioning with these shadowy clouds , as we did for a long time , was not terrifying but fascinating . Eventually we came into the open , leaving the long ravine behind . The sky was blue , the air cool and fresh against our faces , invigorating like a midwinter sleigh ride in Vermont. // A nudge on our backs ( strong enough to get through coverall , leather coat , tweed jacket , and sweater ) called our attention to the framed map the mechanic was holding . His finger located Beauvais , and we knew that the fancy little hatbox we were seeing below us was in reality Beauvais Cathedral . Not long after this , we were enveloped in opalescence , making our way into and through an enormous cloud , flying totally blind . This experience over , we saw again clear blue sky above and dainty bits of cumulus cloud drifting around us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French countryside with its clearly defined walls , highways , rivers , was as neat and trim as patterned linoleum . We were probably flying 2 , 000 feet above it. // Our highest altitude of the whole trip was 3 , 000 feet , which we attained over the English Channel . This height , we were later informed , was a safety precaution , for , from that altitude , the pilot was convinced he could guide the plane to land on either French or English soil should an emergency occur . The Channel itself , with its different hues of green , blue , violet , indicating shallows and depths , made a lovely surface for the craft moving slowly in both directions . Over the Downs of southeast England , great herds of sheep feeding and moving in unison almost convinced us that a large woolly blanket was drifting gently over ' ' meadows trim with daisies pied. ' ' // The engines roared on , the propellers whirred , and soon we sighted Croydon Field . We settled down there as smoothly as we had risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never exceeding a 90-mile-per-hour speed , and usually traveling more conservatively. // Doubtless our inside companions had busied themselves profitably with maps and attempts to identify landmarks . There had been little of that for us . We had identified with the elements : wind , sky , clouds , and with a plane that was proving man ' s dominion in the air. // We shed our paraphernalia at Croydon . After recovering our handbags and later our hearing , we spent the evening at a London theater . Our bodies were there ; our thoughts were still drifting with the clouds . We had had an unforgettable experience , a four-hour flight from Paris to London in the nose seat of a Handley Page plane , in the year 1921. // //
