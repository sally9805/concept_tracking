Last August , it was bought by Advanced Telecommunications Corporation , a Houston company selling discount long distance . And last week , Advanced Telecommunications itself announced plans to merge with TA Communications Inc. , an Atlanta concern. // The long-awaited shakeout in the long-distance business has begun , and little companies with big high- tech names are among the first to go , often in lucrative takeovers. // <> <> Thinning of the Ranks // According to the Yankee Group , a Boston consulting firm , the companies offering long-distance service will shrink to 20 by 1990 , from 400 today . Nearly all the current players buy discount long-distance service from other carriers - mainly A.T. &; T. - and resell it at a profit. // Most of the companies in the industry are small , serving one town . They are getting out while the getting is good , escaping the rising costs now associated with being a long-distance competitor. // Many are being gobbled up by larger resellers like TA Communications that are seeking to add to their customer base . Other resellers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the industry , are moving into other telecommunications services and scrambling to build their own telephone networks. // " Resellers are starting to look toward merger and acquisition partners for elements they may be lacking and to assure their long-term viability and profits , " said Arthur Evans , a New York consultant who is representing two resellers seeking merger partners . Among those elements , he said , are sufficient traffic volume to provide economies of scale , financing to build long-haul networks and enough qualified engineers. // <> <> Growth Followed 1981 Ruling // The resellers sprang from an F.C.C. ruling in 1981 that sought to increase competition in long distance by allowing the resale of A.T. &; T. ' s long-distance WATS service , in which the discounts grow with greater use . Lured by the promise of easy profits with little capital , the industry attracted swarms of investors. // For many of the small resellers , the prime source of trouble is equal access , under which telephone users can select their long-distance carrier merely by filling out a card . In return , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digits to connect with a long-distance carrier other than A.T. &; T. // With equal access , the resellers must invest heavily in modern switching equipment and in marketing their services. // At the same time , their costs are climbing because the discount they get for access to the local telephone network is disappearing as equal access is introduced city by city. // <> <> Lesser Cost Advantage // Also , most analysts expect lower prices for regular long distance in coming years , eliminating some of the cost advantage that resellers enjoy. // WATS ' s own survival is uncertain . Critics charge that WATS violates Federal law against discriminatory pricing in telephone rates because WATS calls go over the same lines as regular long-distance calls but WATS is generally available only to the largest users . The Federal Communications Commission is investigating , and some analysts expect regulators to eliminate some WATS discounts or to scrap WATS altogether. // " For the resellers that rely heavily on WATS lines , the future is pretty bleak , " said Naomi Kalmus , an analyst at International Resource Development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an industry of 400 small companies , bankruptcy does seem to be inevitable , at least for some. " // <> <> Example in Atlanta // In most major cities , resale companies were organized by wealthy local businessmen with little experience in telecommunicatiozns. // In early 1982 , for example , Jack Phillips , Richard Beauchamp and Steven Raville , three Atlanta business partners , were attracted to the business when a soon-to-retire telephone company engineer came to them with this proposal : For $400 , 000 , they could lease a calling switch from the local phone company , buy its discounted WATS service in bulk , then resell it at a profit to businesses and homes that could not afford regular WATS or that wanted special features. // The company became TA Communications . Mr. Phillips , now TA ' s chief executive , had been an auto importer and dealer ; Mr. Beauchamp , now chairman , still heads a refrigerated freight carrier , and Mr. Raville , co-chief executive , was an attorney. // " I didn ' t know anything about telephones other than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But business is no different in selling minutes on a telephone than in selling spark plugs. " // <> <> 1. 5% of a Big Market // According to International Resource Development , resellers sold $700 million in long-distance calls last year , or about 1. 5 percent of the total domestic long-distance market . Last year ' s level was up from $150 million in 1981. // International Resource projects that resellers ' sales will jump to $1. 7 billion by 1986 , but says that would be divided among fewer companies. // A.T. &; T. , local Bell telephone companies and competitors like the MCI Communications Corporation - which itself resells A.T. &; T. services to complete calls to locations that are not served by MCI ' s network - are expected to garner most of the long- distance revenues. // Most analysts agree that A.T. &; T. ' s regular long-distance rates will fall and competitors ' rates will rise as the F.C.C. puts in place its policy of pricing based on costs . The agency is trying to remove many of the big subsidies rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to keep the cost of local service low . <> <> Comparison of Rates // As the differences between rates narrow , the resellers ' big selling point - lower rates - will disappear. // In 1983 , a reseller that wanted to maintain a 20 percent discount from A.T. &; T. ' s regular long-distance prices could buy WATS service for 33 cents a minute and resell it for 35 cents , for a 2-cent profit , according to International Resource . That compared with A.T. &; T. ' s regular charge of 44 cents a minute. // The research group expects the F.C.C. to lower regular long-distance rates faster than WATS rates through 1986 . By then , it says , the profit on that same minute of calling time will shrink to six-tenths of a cent if the reseller maintains a 20 percent discount . If the reseller raises prices in an effort to maintain profits , it risks losing customers. // <> <> A $70 Million Takeover // Among the larger mergers and acquisitions that have occurred , United Telecommunications Inc. , an independent company based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a major Dallas- based reseller , in June for about $70 million in stock . The Lexitel Corporation of Birmingham , Mich. , and LDX Inc. of St. Louis announced their merger in July . And Ford Aerospace and Communications paid an undisclosed amount in May for 70 percent of Starnet , a reseller in San Diego. // Some of the resellers do not rely solely on WATS . Bigger ones have lowered their costs by leasing special flat-rate private lines from A.T. &; T. or one of its competitors . Before equal access , they paid only 55 percent of the cost of plugging into local networks that A.T. &; T. paid . But in cities with equal access , they must pay an equal charge. // Like other major resellers , Allnet , which has acquired two smaller resellers so far this year , is expanding into specialized business services , such as radio paging , call forwarding and market research . Moreover , the company is building a $25 million microwave telephone network to lessen its dependence on A.T. &; T. and other suppliers. // " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we carry will be on a network that we either own or lease on a long-term basis , " said Melvyn J. Goodman , Allnet ' s president . " And you need diversification into products and services that are going to have better margins in order to be profitable. " //
