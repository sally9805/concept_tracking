If anyone knows , it would be Seikaly . For the last three seasons , the 6-foot-10-inch center has been on the receiving end of Boeheim ' s riveting lectures and impromptu critiques . They have come during practice , during games , after games and sometimes through the news media . The two have had a sometimes warm , sometimes frosty relationship , one that has occasionally driven Boeheim to frustration and Seikaly to angry outbursts. // As Syracuse prepares for another run through the Big East schedule , Seikaly says there has been a change in his coach. // " He ' s letting us play with more confidence now ; he ' s a lot more postive , " Seikaly said in an interview last week . " In my first three years here , whenever we played any team , whether it was Canisius or St. Bonaventure , he would always say , ' St. Bonaventure is a great , great team , they ' re going to beat you if don ' t come ready to play . ' This year , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You go out there and beat them . ' That ' s a different confidence that he has in us. " // If there has been a mellowing in Boeheim , the credit must go to a phenomenal campaign last season when Syracuse went 31-7 , winding up with a Final Four appearance and a 1-point loss to Indiana in the national championship game. // The team ' s performance muffled Boeheim ' s critics , at least for now. // " He ' s gotten his respectability , he doesn ' t need to prove to anybody anything anymore , " Seikaly said . " I think that ' s why he ' s a little more relaxed - on us. " // But Boeheim , who has the fourth-highest winning percentage among active coaches , admitted he is haunted by his team ' s 74-73 loss in last spring ' s title game. // He is not consoled by the thought that this year ' s team might be better than last year ' s. // " You never can get that one back , " Boeheim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . I dream about it , I always will . The other night , I woke up thinking about the last four or five minutes of the game . I haven ' t seen the film but I know every play. " // Boeheim may get another chance at it because Syracuse may have the ingredients for a repeat performance . With two games remaining before the conference opener with Boston College , Syracuse goes into tonight ' s game against Morehead State with an 8-2 record . The losses were to North Carolina , 96-93 , in overtime in the Tipoff Classic , and to now top-ranked Arizona , 80-69. // " I think the two early losses have really helped us , " Seikaly said . " They prepared us for what to expect from top-caliber teams . We know that they ' re going to put a box-and-one on Matt Roe , trying to take his jump shot away , they ' re going to try to pack it in to take our inside game away , they ' re going to try to take Sherman out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With three starters returning from last season and a talented bench , Syracuse appears to have the answers to nearly any call . Whether they ' ll fit together in time - or at the right time - is another matter. // " This team is still dependent upon younger players in order to establish itself , " Boeheim said . " I ' m talking about Matt Roe , Earl Duncan , Keith Hughes and Stevie Thompson : four sophomores . What the other guys are going to give you is there , they ' ve already proven themselves in everyway you can ask , in tournament play and regular-season play. " // Sherman Douglas , the 6-2 junior guard , may be the most intelligent backcourt player in the country and one of the most tenacious competitors . " I said at the beginning of the year that I thought he couldn ' t play any better than he played last season , " Boeheim said . " But he ' s playing better . " Douglas is averaging 17. 5 points and 7. 2 assists a game this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 7. 6 assists. // In Derrick Coleman , the 6-9 sophomore forward , Syracuse has a tough rebounder and a versatile scorer with unlimited potential . Regarded by Boeheim as the team ' s best ball-handler after Douglas , Coleman is averaging 13. 2 points and 10. 9 rebounds and may be turned loose before the season is over. // But the foundation of the Orangemen this season is Seikaly . In three seasons , he has progressed from being a mechanical offensive player to being one of the nation ' s best all-round centers . His scoring average during the last three seasons has increased from 8. 1 to 10. 1 to 15. 1 points a game . Seikaly ' s current average is 15. 2 , and he has an opportunity to become the second player in Syracuse history to top 1 , 000 points and 1 , 000 rebounds. // Douglas , Coleman and Seikaly will carry Syracuse to the tournament , but the support players will determine how well they do once they get there. // " There ' s three guys who are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boeheim said , " but we need the other people . Our bench is still a concern. " // One of the questions facing Syracuse is how to replace Howard Triche and Greg Monore. // While neither player was a talent on the order of Douglas , Coleman or Seiklay , each was a consummate role player . Triche was an excellent defender , a dependable outside shooter and solid ball-handler . Monroe was a steady ball-handler , a good defender and a steady 3-point shooter. // " Greg and Howard were balance , " Boeheim said . " Sherman , Derrick and Rony are very emotional players , and you need that . But Greg and Howard were good defensively , they were good ball-handlers , and they could shoot . They really fit in with these other three guys . Now , we ' re trying to fit four guys into those two roles. " // Stevie Thompson , the 6-4 sophomore swingman , is a good athlete , but is not an accomplished shooter and has been victimized on defense. // Derek Brower , who played so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a miserable start . Keith Hughes , a 6-7 210-pound sophomore forward , is perhaps the most talented player off the bench , but lacks experience. // While Boeheim juggles the pieces , defenses have unashamedly cheated down on Seikaly and Coleman . Seikaly has complained about not getting the ball enough , though in recent weeks he has come to understand that defenses are not letting the ball come through. // Roe , a 6-4 guard from Manlius , N.Y. , is a 56 percent 3-point shooter and for the moment at least has solved Syracuse ' s problem at the No. 2 guard position . Earl Duncan , a 6-3 guard from Los Angeles who sat out last year as a freshman because he failed to meet the N.C.A.A. ' s minimum academic requirements , has played poorly since the season began and lost his starting job to Roe. // " I think there ' s potential for this team , but right now we don ' t have the stability we had last year , " Boeheim said . " Things bother us , adversity bothers us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get to where we were last year remains to be seen. " //
