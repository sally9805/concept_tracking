In 1974 John Wayne , in exchange for publicity for a new film , agreed to submit to what columnists call a roasting by the Harvard Lampoon , of which I was then a slavish new inductee . He was brought into Cambridge on an armored personnel carrier ( one member 's father had military connections ) for a press conference pitting his manliness on the street against Harvard 's indoorsy insulation . A whey-faced cineaste in the Harvard Square Theatre audience asked him , " Do you look at yourself as an American legend ? " to which the Duke ad-libbed , " Well , not being a Harvard man , I do n't look at myself any more than necessary . " This week the late-summer media will briefly turn crimson : Harvard , an American legend that is always willing to look at itself , is celebrating its 350th anniversary . It is n't even a nice decimal-age centennial ; and as yogis and Yalies will point out with their infuriating calm , on the long arm of history 350 years make a mere fingernail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bells is summoning pots of filial donations to an already corpulent endowment and provoking pained genuflection from the press . Prince Charles is coming , and President Reagan is n't , which seems appropriate since Charles better suits the Harvard typecast : the boulevardier-royal . Fireworks and the Boston Pops will force even beleaguered townies to think again of all those Learned Fellows , and the hagiographic haze last applied to the Statue of Liberty on its 100th birthday will engulf the dubious , the envious and the admiring alike . Over the years editorial cartoonists have variously depicted Harvard students as tuxedoed playboys , greasy eggheads , scroungy Bolsheviks and raccoon-coated boosters with X 's in their eyes from drink . Though popular with the admissions office , the " achiever " image is ambiguous , since it describes types as diverse as Buckminster Fuller and Henry Kissinger , or even Cotton Mather , the prototypical high-minded Harvard can-doer , a child prodigy and later the most influential speaker of his day , but I 'll bet you secretly think he 's tedious . Some partisans cherish Harvard 's olderthan-thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open-minded , deep-voiced bastion ( ideally played by Gregory Peck ) that is always among the first to house innovations like meritocracy and legal case study . The university 's avuncular latitude so sponsors diversity and self-motivation that its undergraduates can go uneducated if they like . Others gnash their capped teeth before job interviews and cry that Harvard reserves for its own the best seats in Congress , the New York Stock Exchange and at the David Letterman show ; that Harvardians confer lunch on each other and any surviving Brooks Brothers while South Africa swelters and you carry heavy UPS parcels for a living . Even poor or lunkheaded alumni ( who exist , never mind how I know ) can  | present their indigence as a beautiful choice in life , since they could have written their own ticket . Still , many Harvard graduates hesitate when asked where they went to college , and murmur , " In Boston , " or , if pressed , " Well , in Cambridge , " as if to forestall the intimidation they think attends the utterance of H @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women to pussyfoot here , to ostentatiously understate when their duty is Veri tas ? Is it modesty ( just a theory ) or fear of resentment ? Have they been through something ? Case study may help . I grew up in blue-collar Cleveland , where no one was obliged to ponder the Harvard mystique ; it was a mythical hot spot like Beverly Hills or Shangri-La ( no ethical comparisons implied , though it would be intriguing ) . My twin brother , Stephen , and I were recruited to apply by watchful old grads from the tonier East Side ; our Jungian doubleness must have seemed to the admissions office a fun way to get its scholarship-distribution roughage . Our ambitions were nebulous ? Stephen wavered between the Navy and becoming Woody Guthrie ; I just wanted people to have a crush on my depth ? but being bundled into this Bentley excited us , although one elderly neighbor offered us cosmic perspective by saying , " Harvard ? ... like Harvard beets ? " It also spooked us . Sight unseen , our classmates might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Caucasians ' Caucasians who incinerated the bumptious with their repartee and posed for Pringle-sweater ads while translating the Song of the Humpback Whale into investment advice . Strapping pre-senators : We and our patient , Joad-shaped parents drove from Ohio and blearily arrived at Harvard Yard around midnight , circling the block repeatedly without finding a way in . A good-bad caffeinelike hope gripped me as we parked illegally , for here among the strapping presenators were smallish cowlicked teens with wrinkled windbreakers and regional accents , all restlessly up late . Still , the buildings were as ponderous and maroon as unabridged dictionaries , and there were Kennedys in there somewhere , and champion ice skaters , and Pinky Bhutto . We guessed that most of our education would come from classmates : our freshman roommates were Chinese , Mormon , Jewish , Peruvian , pre-med and a preppy who I gathered was dating a long-late ex-president 's **31;817;TOOLONG . Everyone seemed to play soccer and then word games into the small hours or argued whether an ostrich egg constitutes the largest single cell . At meals ( ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshman Union ) , people offered their first names : Laetitia , Clayton , Kendall , Sherrod , Barclay . I noticed that one places knife and fork together on the edge of the plate when one finishes eating . The chandeliers were made from antlers of animals Teddy Roosevelt himself shot . Touring the Hasty Pudding Club , I saw framed photos of eminent men under the legend , " From the Pudding to the Papacy . " Closer examination showed it read , " From the Pudding to the Presidency " ? JFK , FDR , Teddy Roosevelt again and John Quincy Adams ? but I was still grabbed . Suddenly I felt the steamroller of privilege , that pinned-under-others ' - good- fortune feeling you get watching " Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous . " One classmate collected vintage autos , another had an array of medieval weapons in his room . They were all friendly , though , and ? except for the underage laser designers ? poised and articulate . I wondered if I could even win Miss Congeniality in this pageant of potential , and horripilated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during Frisbee , because I 'd never heard of him . The air surged with mass first-date humidity and the dull clacking sound of soft young antlers in nervous ritual combat . One with-it prep observed , " I know you went to public school because I can see there 's a comb in the rear pocket of your jeans . " I put on a Rachmaninoff record as I unpacked , hoping to win points , only to hear a snide passing voice in the hallway remark , " Not Rachmaninoff , come on ! " At the first lecture I attended , a young woman rushed the stage to shout , " But what is poetry for ? " Luckily , the Psycheout of the Innocents could n't last . Its own strain bred solidarity , and up welled reassuringly banal water fights and decorative outdoor toilet-paperings . The wary circling gave way to mutual excitement , a kind of blanket joint venturesomeness that may explain the well-tended graduates ' grapevine later . B. F. Skinner , whom I know about now , might say a helpless duckling-style imprinting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a cult , at boot camp or at any other college . Anyway , I relaxed and drank in the tourist attractions : " Look , the bridge where Faulkner had Quentin Compson commit suicide ! Longfellow died over there ! That library was built for Harry Widener , who died retrieving rare books off the Titanic ! Robert Lowell rides this elevator sometimes ! Norman Mailer punched someone on that green ! There 's the Fly Club , where young FDR conceived the New Deal after being rejected by the Porcellian ! Did they really used to throw red-hot pennies out the windows to burn street urchins ' fingers ? Is that sherry those Episcopalians S 0 C I E T Y  | are drinking ? Do you call those things crew boats ? Hey , Leonard Bernstein ! " Certainly some took it lackadaisically , especially those trim quiet Yankees whose parents and grandparents had gone there . Their photos in the freshman register hinted at the difference : those from private schools relaxed in woodsy settings ( land they owned ? ) while their sandy hair blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their studio-limbo mug shots . As time went by the stiffness passed , the thawing Trilbys understood that getting in was the tough part and the final selection of courses brought a martial tedium to the proceedings . Harvard offered plenty of not-for-credit Activities for those whose Achieving included a Fun prospectus . Most vociferously fun was the Lampoon , a lavish if unofficial extracurricular publication that sat as apart from the college as its arcanely jokey Castle ( donated by San Simeon builder William Randolph Hearst ) did on its own traffic island in Freedom Square . The Lampoon was regarded as " sick , " and it certainly made light of illness and death in a way only those experienced with neither have the luxury to do . I was cretinously transfixed by its delft tile , brass and Oriental fixings , and its fast-talking , determinedly jaded members epitomized the type unformed youth likes to be approved by ( like everything else , you had to compete and be selected to get on ) . I let the Castle possess me , as any eerie old house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the office was the stylish open-ended loiter , carried on in shifts as if to break a Guinness record for gross sexual patter conducted by virgins . The magazine came out sporadically , almost as a sideline to the forest-of-Arden hanging out . Inadvertently vandalized : The Lampoon was accused of racism , too ? one of its covers showed a black shoeshine boy polishing the shoes of the statue of John Harvard . Was it elitism , or about elitism ? Also unpopular were its plate-breaking dinners and its hundredth-anniversary party in 1976 , which featured a tree decked with cooked lobsters , a specially hired and inadvertently vandalized train , a garish gift limousine to John Kenneth Galbraith and George Plimpton and the Grucci family 's fireworks . For a rebel and prodigal son , the club resembled its father when it entertained . Harvard offered no theater-arts major , but students organized and performed more than 40 campus productions a year . The scene ranged ( range is a Harvard specialty ) from Gilbert and Sullivan ( some Cliffies did n't shave under their arms even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disheveled productions of foreign or at least foreign-seeming plays in the Experimental Theatre ( I sat through the annual classic in the original Greek , but I skipped Artaud 's Theatre of Cruelty ) . Individual houses took stabs at Shakespeare and musical comedy that no one forced them to take ( you still had to try out and be selected ) . Most well funded and hence most publicized was the Hasty Pudding Show , the anachronistic burlesque theatrical in which men play the women 's parts . As uneasy as it makes some , it 's preserved as a sentimental remnant of Harvard 's earlier all-male , prenuclear idyll , but I relished it as a fully equipped workshop where I could practice fervent farcical constructions . Theatrical comedy was my interest ? it could have been bivalves or Russian or electrical filaments ? and I found my version of a lab in which to learn it . For that kind of education , academics seemed secondary , but I did think I breathed the Pure Serene in some small ( all right , no exam ) seminars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Becket and Oedipus in successive breaths and then go for home on how we so hate the unfamiliar we falsify the present to make it bearable . One of his writing students got so involved he actually walked back and forth on the conference table improvising beatnik poetry while Alfred listened with a glazed respect for all living things . Poet Elizabeth Bishop called everyone flatteringly by Miss or Mister , even when their poems were about red-hot testicles or ballads of the shootin of RFK . Her mild strength thrilled me , since the most Plathian torrents rated only " Oh my " from her , and when Alfred did his hilarious imitation of weary Mrs. Micawber ( " I will never leave you , Micawber ! " ) , I wondered if he was thinking of our verse plays and our stream-of-consciousness novels . Like many of my tutors at Harvard , they let you feel lofty ? or aloft , at any rate ? and if it was an absurd sojourn , they were the only ones who suffered . Moving sidewalk ? In the end , Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early Erich Segal would have you think . Like skiing and the liberated Lacoste shirt , anyone can shop for it now . The Blondest and Blandest have dutifully if murmuringly rendered seats on the gravy train to the Best and Brightest , including everincreasing proportions of public-school students , blacks , Hispanics , women and even home-taught goatherds ( two currently enrolled brothers ) . However , once on the socially Darwinian " invite " list , does ambition make elitists of them all ? Are its grads building more stately mansions ( as per alum Oliver Wendell Holmes ' swank order to his soul ) or just buying them ? Did he who made Cap Weinberger make thee ( Helen Keller ' 04 , say ) ? Did Harvard in fact ever make anybody ( I do n't look made ) , or just channel the already-rolling orange into the Select basket ? It opens doors , but is it a moving sidewalk ? Still , the remote Bushmen of the Kalahari use connections ( " I know who can fix that spear for you " ) and death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't see Harvardians on the space shuttle , or MTV , though John Reed ( ' 10 ) is buried in the Kremlin . Stanford , Yale and other colleges share or even outstrip Harvard 's excellence , the University of Virginia has a nicer lawn , and even the Army can make you All That You Can Be . Harvard has influenced the course of American history and thought , but I 'm convinced other things must have , too . If you think about it right before bedtime , it all seems a tad inconsequential , and all the intramural kvelling , especially when decked in this week 's cocktail parties and symposia , seems Lilliputian . What about the imploding universe ? Still , old , good Harvard is giving itself a party of selflove , and as the first Harvard man I ever looked at said , " Love means never having to say you 're sorry .
