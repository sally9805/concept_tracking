 | 1982 has been a remarkable year for the future King of England . On June 21st Prince Charles and his wife , the former Lady Diana Spencer and now the Princess of Wales , welcomed their first child , Prince William of Wales . The child 's birth and christening brought joy not only to the British , but to those millions and millions of people around the world who had watched the wedding on television . So it is , of late , that the Prince has been pictured mostly as a new husband and a new father . Though these roles are incredibly important to him , he has throughout the 16 months since his marriage  | kept up with his work ? doing those things that he must do as Prince of Wales and those things that he wants to do . And one project that Prince Charles has wanted to see successfully completed in 1982 may , if tides are right , come to pass . Since 1975 the Prince has hoped to see the grand old British ship the Mary Rose raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Channel near Portsmouth where it went down in a skirmish with the French . That skirish took place more than 400 years ago in 1545 . And the then King of England , Henry VIII , watched as the pride of his fleet sank . Prince Charles does very few private interviews . Yet because of his enthusiasm for the Mary Rose project he heads the Mary Rose Trust , the organization that is trying to raise money to raise the ship and to find a permanent museum for it once it has been raised , he agreed to talk to writers Jo Foley and Anne-Marie Sapsted about the project and other things . The writers were invited to Highgrove , the Prince 's home , for the talk . Here is their report : Highgrove House stands in the picturesque Cotswold countryside , just outside the village of Tetbury , a two-hour drive from London . It is an attractive house , though not as grand as most would imagine . We were greeted by the Prince 's equerry his personal assistant and escorted along a passageway to the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious that a family was in residence . Though we did not see the Princess of Wales nor baby William , we did spy a box of disposable diapers and a large . navy-blue pram . The kitchen , close by . was a hive of activity and obviously a cheery place for people to gather for a chat and tea . We were taken into a warm , comfortable drawing room . There was the faint aroma of fresh flowers mingled with the scent from a bowl of rose petals . The room was decorated in yellow , pale green , and beige . Lots of tall windows overlooked a garden . The view stretched to a park where , the Prince told us , he has planted lots of trees since taking over the house in May 1980 . When the Prince entered , we stood up to be introduced . He shook hands and we sat down to talk . Coffee had been served . At the start , he told us how he first became interested in the Mary Rose project . " It was Lord Mountbatten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on August 27 , 1979 who suggested I go look at it in 1975 , " the Prince said . " I was in a.rough old boat with a few keen divers and we jumped off to have a look . At that stage there was absolutely nothing down there . ' here was little to see ? only odd timbers sticking out of the mud . " Since that time more than 26,000 dives to the ship have been made by a largely volunteer diving force . And a total of 13,702 artifacts have been brought up . The remains of the ship itself are to be brought to the surface momentarily . Since his first dive , the Prince has kept a close watch on the project that intrigues him . " It 's intriguing because it has this combination of diving and something historical , and generally I was interested in archeology and history . For me. anyway . there is something riveting about swimming around and touching something that goes so far back and is part of our maritime heritage . " The Mary Rose is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet the Prince thinks there are more challenging risks ? among them getting gold out of the HMS Edinburgh , the British ship that went down in the Barents Sea " To go down there in a diving bell . says the Prince , " live there , and then get out and dive into a wreck wondering whether the thing is going to collapse ? the Mary Rose is tame compared with that . " Then there 's the Transglobe expedition headed by Sir Ranulph Fiennes . " I spoke to Ranulph Fiennes the other day and he was fairly confident he was going to get hack at the end of the month . The trip was successfully . completed on August 29 , 1982 . That 's an astonishing achievement , " says the Prince of Sir Ranulph 's attempt to circumnavigate the globe following the Greenwich meridian line that crosses both Antarctica and the Arctic . Another challenge the Prince mentioned : climbing Mount Everest . " I do n't think it matters how many people have climbed it , it 's still incredibibly hard . Those sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're brave enough . I know that one of my limitations is clinging to the face of a rock thousands of feet high . . . one of the things I 'm not particularly good at . " But I find that overcoming physical challenges and danger is incredibly helpful toward overcoming things normally ? facing moral challenges . I think as I get older the challenges I go for will be not so much physical as spiritual , and they arc equally , if not more , important . In some ways I envy my  | brother Prince Andrew being able to go and do what he did in the South Atlantic . Prince Andrew was a helicopter pilot during the Falkland Islands war . I never had that chance to test myself . It 's terribly important to see how you react ? to be tested . " Aside from the challenge , the Prince feels the Mary Rose is important to Britain 's naval and maritime heritage . " I have a very strong feeling for history and have always been fascinated by it , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite young and that contributed to a great awareness of the past and its relevance to the future . " Things like the Mary Rose remind us in a small way of Britain 's great heritage as a seafaring people . We are the only big island in Europe , the only ' aircraft carrier ' off Europe , and we have a major responsibility in a maritime sense . I think the danger is that our priorities are clouded by all sorts of other things . As an island I think the more people learn about our reliance on the sea , and the Navy , the better . We are faced with problems that other people , who are not islanders , do n't have . We should never forget that . Take the South Atlantic Falklands conflict for instance . . . unfortunately we have to learn these things the hard way , and it is so sad . " All through his life , the Prince seems to have opted for challenges . Did some of the challenges ever frighten him ? " Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standing in the door of the airplane=you get enormous butterflies in your tummy . Steeplechasing is petrifying , but also extremely exciting . . . elating ? when you 've done it . The thrill of having achieved and overcome your fear of the unknown , or of hurting yourself , is all in the mind . You can overcome it if you talk to yourself about it , which I try to do . At the same time I think you 'd be silly if you are n't a bit apprehensive about things like diving . I do n't do enough to get complacent but there are always people who do , and that 's when things go wrong . " The Prince 's enthusiasm for the Mary Rose ? and history ? is not yet , of course , shared by his son . " I think we 'll wait until my son is a little bit older before we take him to see the Mary Rose so that he can appreciate it . . . there is a danger of pushing too fast . Five and above is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found with my godchildren , for instance , that five is the cutoff age at which they appreciate things . Below that , they do n't . The thing to do , if you ca n't do it yourself , is to find somebody who makes the subject particularly interesting . I remember how , as a child , people made me enthusiastic about a particular subject . " Charles tried to pass on this gift for arousing children 's enthusiasm , by , as he says . " writing a ridiculous story . The Old Man of Lochnagar for my brothers . The Mary Rose is the sort of thing that appeals to children because it makes history come alive . " The Mary Rose has made history come alive for a lot of British women too . According to the Prince ' . " There are plenty of women divers , and a lot of women involved in the Mary Rose project ? Margaret Rule , for example , the archaeological director , inspires people . She 's a really intriguing character , knows her stuff , conveys her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what women are expected to do , I still feel all the same ? and at the risk of sticking my neck out ? that one of the most important roles any woman could ever perform is to be a mother . And nobody  | should ever denigrate that role . How children grow up , what attitudes they have , are absolutely vital both from the social point of view , and for the future . And all this stems so much from the role the mother performs . " I know it 's awfully difficult nowadays because women want to work , and have to do so , to earn enough . It is very hard . But the role of a mother is so terribly important . " One of the nice things about the Mary Rose is that it combines business with pleasure . But it 's not so much fun , say , as ordinary diving off the west coast of this country where the water 's a lot clearer and warmer and you can actually see the wrecks . I remember diving in Colombia in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coral , and I spent hours in my cabin chipping away , and out came these silver coins . I 've dived a lot in the Virgin Islands , the Caribbean , places like that , which are very nice . " There are things as I go along that I find I 'd like to do ? one is ballooning ? and somebody says , Oh no , you must n't ' . They are saying this increasingly . It 's always a problem to find the right balance because I could easily demand that I do these things and to hell with everybody else . But it 's important to be aware of those who are going to take the rap ? if something happens to me . One 's got to be fair to them I think , not to make life impossible . I try to be reasonable , though I 'm not always . ' Many of the things I 've done ? diving , parachuting , things like that ? I never found particularly hazardous . Everyone else has . I 've always had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , I must try to set an example , lead from the front , show that I 'm prepared to do the things you expect other people to do . The only reason I did the parachute training was because I was made colonel-in-chief of the Parachute Regiment and I could not look those chaps in the face as their colonel-in-chief without having done the initial training . It 's something very primeval , in a funny way , like ... kings always used to lead their troops into battle , and I suppose it 's a hangover from that , that I have ? personally . You must lead from the front ; it 's one of the vital aspects of leadership . I think this is what a lot of journalists found when they went to the South Atlantic Falklands . I 've been told by army , navy , and air-force officers that the journalists saw them , perhaps , as upper-class twits , ' but in the end journalists found things were very different . Whereas not one officer got killed on the other sidethat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you talk , make speeches , it 's what you do that matters . So if I 've done those apparently dangerous things , well ... I 'm one of those people who feels I ought to do them . I ca n't just have my name on the top of letters . It 's very important to do things . . . because I think it helps the chaps working in the field . "
