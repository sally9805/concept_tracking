LOVE STREAMS Directed by John Cassavetes Screenplay by Ted Allan and John Cassavetes <P> Of all the women who have given up at least a portion of their careers for marriage and children , Gena Rowlands may have got the best deal . For her husband John Cassavetes makes small , eccentric movies almost entirely comprising sublime ( or would-be sublime ) actor 's moments that he parcels out among family and friends . In recent years he has seen to it that his wife gets a very fair share of these . The result is that with such pictures as A Woman Under the Influence , Minnie and Moskowitz and Gloria she has had an opportunity vouchsafed few mainstream actresses these days : she has been allowed to create a true screen character . <P> Vulnerable , brave and loopy-a panicky paradigm of middle-age desperation-this creature is again on glorious display as Sarah in Love Streams . In it , Cassavetes also creates an answering male character , Sarah 's brother , who has taken up womanizing in an attempt to ward off the chill he feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful characterization , partly because such males have become a clich , but mostly because Cassavetes , the obsessed film maker , does not really understand certain less exalted obsessions that may distractingly come upon a man . His character neither fully focuses nor finally explodes . <P> Rowlands ' Sarah does . She is a woman of excess , whose efforts to rid herself of that quality are , needless to say , marred by excessiveness . She loves her husband and daughter to pieces , and when we meet her at a divorce hearing she is sweetly , distractedly explaining that she can not be too precise about times and dates when her mate can visit their child ; they have this busy schedule flying about the country , visiting sick and dying relatives . Later , trying to forget her troubles by touring Europe , she is undone by excess baggage . <P> Naturally . Landing finally at her brother 's place , she decides that the cure for his glum raffishness must be pets on whom he can practice a responsible form of loving . Forthwith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goat , an affably neurotic dog and a pair of miniature horses that trot , puzzled but agreeable , through the house . It is as she tells her psychiatrist : " I 'm going to get my balance . Then I can go back to being obsessed with my family . " <P> When she is not present there are-a familiar problem with Cassavetes-too many approximations of a scene 's emotional point , too many claims on an audience 's indulgence . Yet no matter how far the mind strays , one never feels safe in letting it slip away completely . You can never tell when Rowlands is going to do something astonishing . It is the unpredictable grace and goofiness of her behavior , the subtle complexity of emotions she generates , that finally overcome all obstacles to enthrallment.
