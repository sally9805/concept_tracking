Stockholm 's metropolitan council decided last week that driving in the congested city is not a right but a service akin to public transportation and that drivers should pay for the privilege . So the council will charge owners of private cars or motorcycles a $45 monthly fee for using their vehicles downtown on weekdays between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m . The permit would also let holders ride the subway and buses . <P> If passed , as expected , by the city council , a higher governmental body , the measure will take effect in October 1990 . It will probably cut the estimated &lt; 195,000 cars that jam the capital daily by only 6% to 8% , but could bring in $50 million a year in revenues . After deducting enforcement costs , the remaining monies would be used to develop mass transit .
