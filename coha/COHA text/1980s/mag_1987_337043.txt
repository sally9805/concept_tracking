The Christmas season is a traditional time for parents to take their children to the movie theater for a little animated fun . This year Walt Disney has reissued its classic Cinderella , and Filmation is coming out with a sequel to Carlo Collodi 's classic tale called Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night . Both represent an increasingly rare breed : animated movies made in the U.S. <P> Almost unnoticed , much of America 's animation business has moved offshore , primarily to Japan and South Korea , in search of lower costs . Since 1980 , the number of unionized U.S. animation workers has fallen from 1,650 to 1,250 , and Lou Scheimer , president of Filmation , contends that his Pinocchio could be the last all-American-made animated movie . Filmation may soon join the ranks of animation companies that produce most of their TV cartoons overseas . <P> Walt Disney executives insist they will continue to make animated movies in the U.S. , but not all their TV shows . Disney 's new Duck Tales series is animated in Japan .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
