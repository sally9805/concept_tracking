Mel Brooks created a psychiatrist character who cured his patients of aberrant behavior by telling them : " Don ' t do that . " Over and over , as you read Sherri Daley ' s memoir , " High Cotton : Love and Death on Wall Street " ( Norton , 304 pages , $18. 95 ) , you want to take her aside , splash some cold water on her face , give her cab fare to get home , and tell her , " Don ' t do that . " This is the story of Ms. Daley ' s liaison with a dynamic cotton trader . Not just any cotton trader , but Philip Hehmeyer , who was president of the Cotton Exchange when he took his life in 1982 . Emotions were also commodities in which he traded , and from the earliest days of their affair , he warned Ms. Daley that he wouldn ' t allow himself to become seriously involved . " It won ' t work and it ' ll hurt , " he told her , absolutely accurately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an answer ; some people thrive on rejection . Cotton is both the villain and the hero of this story , and it ' s too bad Ms. Daley isn ' t more interested or more skillful in describing the daily organized frenzy on the floor of the exchange , where young men grew rich even as they burned out . It was in the early 1970s that Mr. Hehmeyer , after a tour in Vietnam , a stint on a Memphis newspaper , and two years managing a bar in St. Thomas , took a job as a runner for a cotton broker . A seat cost only a few thousand dollars in those heady , pre-regulated days , and he was soon the youngest member in the history of the exchange . On days when the market was up , he was a fabulously rich man . On other days , when the market was down and he was short , he had to do such things as sell his apartment to cover his margin . Worshiped by a peer group of fellow Southerners , he thrived on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic Jaguar to lavish parties at elaborate country houses . He had the best champagne and the best cocaine . He bought a boat and named it " High Cotton "  --  a Southern expression for being in the money . Ms. Daley was among the emotionally walking wounded when she met Mr. Hehmeyer at a party in 1976 . Her marriage to her college sweetheart had ended in divorce , and her affair with a married man fizzled when he went back to his wife . Ms. Daley was bowled over by the remoulade of alcohol , money , power , speed ( chemical and rpm ) , sex , tension , drama , nonchalance and assurance . But it would be hard to imagine a greater misalliance . Here was Phil Hehmeyer , this incredible Roman candle of a guy , dominating the days and illuminating the nights for the numbers of people he needed around him . And here was Sherri Daley , the most clinging vine in the pre-feminist nursery of female stereotypes , wanting only to be the one woman of a one-woman man . Ms. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convey what must have been Mr. Hehmeyer ' s manic allure . The pranks and quirks she cites place him somewhere between a fraternity charmer and a pain in the neck  --  more like a boozy Uncle Mame than one of the most charismatic men of his generation . She tells us that he shouted at the moon and talked people into going sailing in winter or playing croquet at sunrise . He demanded silence of strangers in elevators if the Muzak was playing Vivaldi . And once he walked across a dance floor and interrupted Ms. Daley ' s conversation with Margaux Hemingway to say that Ms. Daley was the most beautiful woman in the room . Much of this conduct , of course , occurred under the influence of controlled substances . But Mr. Hehmeyer ' s antics , whatever their source , are not what make this book hard to forget . What sticks in the mind is the uncompromising depiction of a lonely woman ' s obsession . We ' re talking serious moth and flame here . He began to treat her abominably and she couldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally ripping her protection from her body so she would become pregnant , Mr. Hehmeyer insisted that she abort the resulting baby . When she returned , alone , from the procedure , he locked her out of the apartment . She hurt her hands and bruised her knees beating them against the door until the building staff removed her . Mr. Hehmeyer ignored her , and took up with other women . She responded by sleeping with his best friend and having his baby . Even this act of self-assertion turned out to be a sham . Mr. Hehmeyer showed up at the hospital , and she writes : " The only time I felt real was when I was with Philip . Everything else was fantasy . " When Mr. Hehmeyer shot himself he left a note on the kitchen chalkboard : " Someone had to do it . Self-awareness is silly . " Ms. Daley had not seen him for several months ; her reaction was immediate . " Philip had promised he wouldn ' t go alone , " she writes . " I felt betrayed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your attention as it feeds your frustration . You can ' t help but think how different so many lives might have been if , at so many turning points , Ms. Daley had gone to see Mel Brooks ' s shrink and taken his advice.  --  - Mr. Gannon , a former special assistant to President Nixon , is now a segment producer for " Late Night With David Letterman.
