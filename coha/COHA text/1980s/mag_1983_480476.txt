A run-in with shoes to run in. imm-FIVE million Americans run for exercise . These include everyone from casual lopers of suburban blocks to devotees of the so-called ultra-marathon ( fifty , count ' em , folks , fifty miles ) . All these people need protection of two different sorts . First , they need physical protection . The typical runner with two feet lands on each foot 800 times a mile , with a force equal to three to six times his or her body weight . Even the casual runner of one mile a day will need to absorb over 10,000 shocks each week . The second need for protection relates to that area of the body north of the feet where the wallet resides . About eighty shoe manufacturers are vying for a share of the one billion dollars runners Timothy F. Bannon , a writer and attorney , lives in Connecticut . His last article for Harper 's , ' ' The Board Game , " about the culture of corporate directors , appeared in December 1982. spend on footwear each year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) has the consumer had so many models of running shoes from which to choose ( three to four hundred ) and so little information on which to base the choice . Running-shoe advertisements are written in a medical-technical Esperanto that does n't convey much actual information . Features such as a " revolutionary Bio-Kinetic sole , " a " unique polyamide netting , " or a " Foster Cradle " may not be nearly as advanced as the Saganesquc jargon used to describe them implies . As it turns out , the " Bio-Kinetic " sole is merely the bottom , or outer-sole , of Osaga 's $29* shoe , the Pacer . If it is revolutionary , the revolution is fairly widespread , since every running-shoe company makes * All prices are either store prices as determined by a survey of retail outlets in the eastern states or , for shoes that may not yet be generally available , the manufacturer 's suggested retail price . 87 soles with exactly the same chemical composition . The studs on the outersole of the Pacer are intended to dissipate the shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other running shoes . Adidas 's " unique " netting is found around the midsoles of the Atlanta ( S49.95 ) , the Oregon ( $42.95 ) , and the Lady Oregon ( $42.95 ) . The midsole , which is simple to explain , is the cushion between the harder rubber outersole and the surface within the shoe ? the insole ? on which the foot actually rests . The polyamide netting , by way of contrast , is impossible to explain and no attempt to do so will be made here . The ads say it will make your legs feel better . As for the " Foster Cradle , " it is a feature of Reebok 's Victory G ( $69.95 ) that is promoted as a mechanism to cushion the subtalus joint . The subtalus joint is , presumably , located in or near the foot . No further information about the " Foster Cradle " is supplied in the ad . A spokesman for Reebok also was not sure where the subtalus joint is , but said the " Foster Cradle " is a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best source of objective information about running shoes used to be an annual survey published by Runner 's World , the largest of several monthly magazines devoted to running . By its nature and provenance , the Runner 's World survey celebrated the differences between shoes of various companies and price ranges . It did not put these differences in perspective nor emphasize essential similarities . By 1981 , the Runner 's World survey contained the results of eleven different scientific tests of more than a hundred different models of running shoes and rankings of the shoes according to performance in categories such as shoe weight , traction , and permeability . By referring to charts containing test results , a prospective shoe customer could tell that the Puma Nite Rider ( $34.95 ) , on the forefoot impact test . had a score of 11.8 times the acceleration caused by gravity , with a mean deviation of 03 HARPER'S/ MAY 1983 0 88 ? 1.31 . This put the Puma Nile Rider in fourth place on this particular test , notwithstanding its unfortunate allusion to the Ku Klux Klan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result the Runner 's World survey became controversial . Some shoe manufacturers claim that the rankings were less related to shoe quality than to the amount of advertising space a company bought in Runner 's World . For whatever reasons , Runner 's World no longer conducts its tests . Instead , its Annual Shoe Survey now rates only the shoe preferences of the magazine 's readers as determined through a subscriber poll . In other words , while it no longer contains any technical data ? helpful or not ? the survey is at least straightforward in its inducement to manufacturers to advertise in the magazine . T HE sophisticated runner should know that , in the argot of the trade , he is not looking for shoes at all . Rather , he seeks a pair of " flats , " a term presumably intended to distinguish running footwear from something else that , since it is not flat , is ill suited to running . The runner who is actually intending to train vigorously for weekend racing may need two pairs of shoes ? a sophisticated training flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing flat ? another $35 to $50 ? for competition . The difference between a racing flat and a training flat is only a matter of a few ounces , but it is also the difference between Mart Dillon and Chester . Racing flats , intended for use in occasional footraccs , sacrifice the protection of shock-absorbent material in favor of lightness for speed . Routine workouts in racing shots almost certainly will maim the user . What is billed as a running flat may be available for $19.95 under the house label of a discount shoe store . This type of shoe is derisively termed " foot covering " by manufacturers of " serious " running shoes . And , in fact , the very cheapest shoes probably do provide insufficient protection for any but the most casual runner . Sad to say , if your weekly miles exceed fifteen , you probably ought to pay at least 530 a pair for shoes . Industry insiders acknowledge that there are no meaningful differences between the low-end models of the " serious " running-shoe companies , such as Nike , Brooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiger , Saucony , Converse , and Reebok . If you run about twenty miles a week at the most , have no aches or pains doing so , and are not plagued by any physical anomalies ? high arches , weak ankles , bad knee cartilage ? a shoe in the $30 to $35 range from any one of these companies should get you around just fine . But inspect your shoes carefully before buying . While there is n't much difference between models , there can be big differences between individual shoes at the low end of the price scale . All manufacturers devote most of their promotional budget to publicizing the sophistication and complex technology of their top-of-the-line , or " flagship , " shoes . None makes any mention of the fact that at least their lower-end shoes come from the Orient , where uncomplaining South Koreans turn them out in great numbers , in some cases virtually without any supervision or input from the manufacturer whose name and logo will be stitched on by the time they reach the stores . A T THE opposite end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Balance 990 ? the first running shoe with a suggested retail price of $100 . By introducing this shoe last year , the New Balance company broke a barrier as important to running-shoe marketers as the two-hour marathon is to the people who wear their products Competitors were quick to term the 990 a marketing gimmick . New Balance denies this . Though it admits that not every runner needs a hundred-dollar shoe , it claims that the 990 in fact has many valuable features . Chief among them is a special carbon rubber heel pad ( the heel portion of the outersole ) that makes it more wear-resistant . Here we come to the essential dilemma of " add-ons " that run up the price of running shoes . Many of them arc not worthless . A heavy runner on hard surfaces can use extra heel protection . On the other hand , these features add far more to the price of the shoe than they actually cost the manufacturer . Take , for example , the Nike Odyssey ( $79.95 ) and the Nike Equator ( $59.95 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( yes , that 's what they 're called ) that come with the two shoes , you 'll find that the only difference between them is that the Odyssey has an " Air-Wedge " and the Equator does not . The " Air-Wedge , " another heel protector , costs thousands to promote and about three dollars to make . My advice regarding most of these gimmicks is , when in doubt , do without . Twenty bucks for an " Air-Wedge " is four or five movies . On the other hand , a single visit to the orthopedist is four or five " Air-Wedges , " so if you 're feeling aches and pains , swallow your annoyance and shell out . Of all areas of running-shoe design , the most remarkable profusion and ballyhoo involve heel stabilizers , in all of their remarkable in carnations . The purpose of a heel stabilizer is both straightforward and laudable . It is intended to limit the heel 's movement within the shoe . Small sideways sliding motions of the heel get translated up the lower leg to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kneecap . As a rule , heel movement itself occurs because of excessive ankle roll either inward ? known as pronation ? or outward ? supination . Before the running boom , there were probably more people who thought that pro-nation and supination were hand gestures accompanying the Catholic Mass than who worried about irregularities in their stride . But to inhibit heel movement and generate consumer enthusiasm , the shoe companies have invented a complete er , makes good , sturdy shoes . However , they do not have the comfort or flexibility of almost any of the other shoes on the market . None of these generalizations can withstand the final analyses , which must be made by you at the store . Running specialty shops ? not a term intended to include national running-shoe chains ? can be very helpful in selecting the right shoe . Unlike the national chains , which seem to be staffed by high school students working their way through expensive cocaine habits , specialty shops are usually managed by experienced runners who keep up to date on running-shoe technology and are willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit . Since shoes do not cost any more at a specialty shop than at the chains , it is worth the effort to find one and patronize it . W HAT happens if , after all this , you begin running in your new shoes and they are not quite right ? If the shoes really hurt , you can try to take them back . In any event , stop running in them . But if the problem is simply a matter of a little absent je ne sais quoi , you will not be concerned for long . For all of their scientific gadgetry , running-shoe manufacturers still turn out shoes that , for the moderate runner , last only four to six months . There is no technological reason for this . The design of running shoes is in the hands of marketers , and a feature like durability , which you can not see , is hard to sell . Then , too , a shoe that lasts twice as long is a shoe that needs to be bought only half as often . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this may change . Already some manufacturers are experimenting with jazzy " wear plugs " that you can buy instead of replacing the entire shoe . But , in general , if your current pair of running shoes is n't completely satisfactory , you need n't worry . You 'll soon have a chance to buy another . ? by Frances Taliaferro The Natural Mau , by Ed McClanahan . New York : Farrar , Straus and Giroux , 229 pages . $11.50 . C ARNAL knowledge ! In simpler times , it was the business of adolescents to acquire it , but not before they had experienced years of longing , yearning , and free-floating horniness . One scanned the adult world for clues to the mystery of life , intimations of carnality that might transform ignorance into experience .

Now the novel of sexual initiation has become a respected subdivision of the Bildungsroman , and now curious adolescents no longer need it because they are swamped with information . But no amount of media coverage will make it any easier to be an adolescent .
