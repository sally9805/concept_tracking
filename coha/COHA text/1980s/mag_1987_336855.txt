There is nothing wrong with House Speaker Jim Wright that being President of the United States would not cure . <P> He has an understandable power itch , which provoked him to jump into the Nicaraguan peace negotiations , where he should not have been . Then last week he stepped out in front of his own colleagues a bit in his eagerness to announce that Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev would appear before a joint session of Congress in December . A Communist leader , by pedigree a determined foe of democracy , has never appeared in the sacred well of the House , and a goodly number of members from both parties have doubts about Gorbachev , glasnost or not . <P> What drives Wright , just as it drove his notable mentor , Lyndon Johnson , is the natural desire to be the most powerful Democrat in the capital . Since his party controls the Congress , he can , with adroit maneuvering , often play President , and then , who knows ? As it did for L.B.J. , history might propel him toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view with interest . <P> But for the moment , Wright 's position in Washington is saturated with acid . Since he became Speaker a year ago , he has unwisely poured out his contempt for Ronald Reagan in dozens of not-so-private gatherings around town . Wright has called the President a " liar " and worse . White House aides , no strangers to bile , whispered again last week , " Jim Wright is a mean-spirited snake-oil salesman , and nobody wants to deal with him . " On the Nicaraguan flap , Wright and Secretary of State George Shultz grandly staged their own truce negotiations , but that hardly dispels what one Congressman calls a " reservoir of bitterness " against the Speaker . Some of that is normal in the election season , but it seemed to go beyond all bounds last week when Georgia 's Newt Gingrich stormed through Florida calling Wright a " genuinely corrupt man " and comparing him to Mussolini . Even given Gingrich 's right-wing fervor , that is startling stuff . <P> It is not startling that Wright has developed disdain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so immersed in the mechanics of legislation and so convinced of their own virtue , find Presidents , who sit at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue , to be woefully ignorant and out of touch . A little contact always seems to prove the point . Three decades ago , when Dwight Eisenhower was ending his two terms , Johnson , the Senate 's majority leader , flared up just like Wright after visits to the White House , though Johnson was far more cautious about who heard him . " That man does not deserve to be President , " L.B.J. roared one night back in his Capitol office , even after Ike had poured him a generous portion of Scotch and soda . Poor old Ike , Johnson recounted , did not know where legislative bills were in Congress or even what was in them .
