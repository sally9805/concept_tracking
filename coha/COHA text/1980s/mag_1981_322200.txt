PATCO loses another round , and so do air travelers <P> The decision may have been the final blow for the former air controllers . The Federal Labor Relations Authority , which grants unions the right to represent a given group of workers , last week revoked that status from the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization . The FLRA ruled that PATCO " willfully and intentionally " violated federal laws by striking three months ago and , as a result , " is no longer a labor organization . " It was the first time that a union representing federal employees has been decreed out of existence , though the precedent is clouded : the bulk of the union 's members who struck have already been severed for violating the no-strike oath in their employment contracts . Said Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis : " The ruling reaffirms a basic principle of our democracy , that no person or organization is above the law . " <P> Union President Robert Poli vowed that his union would appeal the decision to the federal courts . " We are still PATCO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A federal court in Washington agreed to hear the case this week and has granted PATCO a temporary delay of the ruling . But some of Poll 's members are pessimistic . Robert Westra , a former controller at Chicago 's O'Hare Airport who is now trying to support himself as a carpenter , pronounced the decision " incredible . " He saw only " a 5% hope " that he will be able to return to work . That slim possibility is based on the faith that , as O'Hare Striker Andrew Price put it , " the system ca n't possibly survive without us . " <P> In fact , it seems that the system can survive without the controllers , albeit at a lower level of air traffic . The time required to rebuild the system is taking a toll on the nation 's airlines and , most visibly , on the patience and stamina of the traveling public . Three major airlines ( Delta , TWA and United ) reported last week that third-quarter earnings had slumped as a result of the reduced air traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that region 's travelers , decided to fold its wings at the end of the month after eleven years of operation . The shutdown will mean layoffs for 400 employees . A company announcement partly blamed " the decline in traffic and revenues because of the ongoing PATCO strike . " The airline had been forced to cut scheduled flights by 25% as a result of the firings . Air New England 's celebrated clientele , which had long used the airline for transportation to Martha 's Vineyard , Nantucket , Cape Cod and other resort areas , are being picked up by Provincetown-Boston Airline and New York Air . <P> The greatest burden on passengers thus far has been an increase in the number and length of flight delays caused by the strike . During the first three weeks of October , takeoff waits of more than 30 min. occurred on 649 flights , a tenfold increase over the same period a year ago .
