According to Lord Palmerston , nations have no permanent allies or enemies , only permanent interests . That maxim contains a warning the Bush Administration should heed as it deals with the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam . <P> It has been more than 14 years since the last Americans were lifted off the embassy roof in Saigon , a televised vignette of ignominy that is still replayed in the U.S. 's memory . Now Viet Nam has suffered its own setback : after more than a decade of trying to defeat a rural insurgency in Cambodia , a Vietnamese expeditionary force has given up and gone home . <P> For years the U.S. has demanded just such a withdrawal as a precondition for the normalization of relations between Washington and Hanoi . Viet Nam hopes that diplomatic recognition by the U.S. and removal of the trade embargo will end its isolation and lead to an influx of Western aid , trade , credits and technology . Many Vietnamese recognize that their political and economic system is a shambles . Some officials admit privately that they can run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration is upping the ante . In addition to pulling out of Cambodia , Viet Nam must contribute to what Washington calls a comprehensive settlement of the civil war the departing occupiers leave behind . By the Administration 's definition , that requires the inclusion of the murderous Khmer Rouge in a coalition , along with two non-Communist Cambodian factions and the current Vietnamese-backed rulers in Phnom Penh . <P> Most of the world condemned the Vietnamese attack on Cambodia in 1978 as an act of aggression . But whatever Hanoi 's predatory motives , the invasion had one positive consequence : it ended the genocidal rule of the Khmer Rouge and drove them into the jungle . There they lurk today , hoping to return to power in the new round of fighting that has become almost inevitable since an international peace conference broke down in Paris in August . ) <P> Washington 's tacit backing of the Khmer Rouge may have contributed as much to the diplomatic impasse as did Hanoi 's support of its stubborn Cambodian clients . That sad symmetry is beginning to look like the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Bush Administration 's first major foreign policy debacle . <P> Diplomatic recognition means just what it says , recognizing a government as a fact of life . Yet the Bush Administration seems determined to treat Viet Nam as something different , an object of permanent hostility . <P> The Vietnamese think they know why . A joke is making the rounds in Hanoi : Viet Nam has done everything it can to lure the Americans to open an embassy there , and nothing has worked ; the only option left is to declare war on the U.S. , then immediately surrender and count on the beneficence that Americans show those they have defeated . <P> Whatever blame the Vietnamese bear for the collapse of diplomacy and the prospect of new bloodshed in their region today , they are unquestionably responsible for the only war the U.S. ever lost . " That war cleaves us still , " said George Bush in his Inaugural Address . " But , friends , surely the statute of limitations has been reached . The final lesson of Viet Nam is that no great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Like Palmerston 's , those were wise words . But the Administration has yet to apply the lesson to Viet Nam itself .
