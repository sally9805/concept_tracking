EVERY SUNDAY MORNING DAVID Nelson 's family attends church on nearby Williams Mountain , where his father Larry , a coal miner , was born 39 years ago . Inside the small Advent Christian church that his father and mother Joy , 36 , helped build , David joins his brother Stephen , 7 , and his sister Nancy , 13 , in a Bible class . Later in the day , the family drives an hour and 15 minutes to another Advent Christian church at the top of a distant and twisting hollow . David 's parents , who are licensed to preach , lead the service , which lasts nearly two hours . <P> Tears well up in Joy 's eyes as she stands at the pulpit one Sunday evening offering testimony to all that God has done for her family . David sits in the pew behind Nancy , combing his sister 's curly blond hair , inattentive to his mother 's preaching . Nancy blows bubbles with thick pink gum . Stephen lies across a nearby pew , asleep . " Boring , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing the final hymn . <P> " It 's hard having two preachers for parents , " says David , who feels the twin yoke of religion and strict parental supervision . David describes the biggest lesson he has learned from his parents . " Not to cuss or go to beer joints or girly bars . Well , they have n't told me not to go to girly bars , but they would n't like it . They do n't like for us to do anything that a Christian would n't do . If I did that , they 'd kill me . " <P> Prenter , W. Va. , where David lives , is a tiny coal camp of a town some 40 miles and a mountain pass south of Charleston . A single paved street runs through the town . One-story look-alike houses with green shutters , rickety porches and peeling paint are squeezed between the road and the steep hills . No traffic light . No police station . No firehouse . No school . That is ten miles down the road , where Prenter Creek empties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pudgy , serious , persistent boy , there was never any question that he would be a coal miner like his dad , who came back from Viet Nam in 1971 and followed his father and grandfather into the coal mines . When David was younger , Larry took him for his first look at the mines . " He was ridin ' me around , " David recalls , " and I looked up and there was this big ! mountain covered with coal . I thought about working there someday . " <P> His choice is more than a mere wanting . It is a profound longing , a matter of identity . David 's younger brother Stephen wants only to play football for West Virginia and go on from there to play professionally , even if it means leaving the hills and the coal mines . David wants his father 's identity , his land and context . <P> He may not be able to have it . Last winter David 's father , like many other miners , lost his job . Unemployment pays him less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be a coal miner , " David says , " if they ai n't shut down . " <P> Even at his age , David understands that workers are being replaced by machines that can mine more coal more cheaply . His father has been laid off twice , the previous time for three years , so David worries about coal 's future as well as his own . " I 'm afraid , " he says , " that later on the dead trees and plants wo n't be able to produce coal and everybody will be losing their jobs . "
