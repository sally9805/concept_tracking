i lICKATRIl COOK A story by Anne Tyler 1 ODY TuLt. , always had a girlfriend , one girl after another , and all the girls were wild about him till they met his brother , Ezra . Something about Ezra just hooked their attention , it seemed . In his presence they took on a bright , sharp , arrested look , as if listening to a sound that others had n't caught yet . Ezra did n't even notice this . Cody did , of course , although he never showed it . An Indian-faced man with smooth black hair , with level , balanced features , he could manage , when he tried , to seem perfectly blank , like a plaster clothing model . Meanwhile . his ragged , dirty , unloved younger self , with failing grades , with a U in deportment , clenched his fists and howled , " Why ? Why always Ezra ? Why that sissy pale goody-goody Ezra ? " But Ezra just gazed into space from behind his clear gray eyes , from under his shock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private thoughts . You could say this for Ezra : he seemed honestly unaware of the effect he had on women . No one could accuse him of stealing them deliberately . But that made it all the worse , in a way . Cody half believed that Ezra had some lack ? a lack that worked in his favor , that made him immune , that set him apart from ordinary men . There was something almost monkish about him . Women never really managed to penetrate his meditations , although he was unfailingly courteous to them . He was likely to contemplate them in silence for an inappropriate length of time , and then ask something completely out of the blue . For instance : " How did you get those little gold circles throughyour ears ? " It was ridiculous  --  a man reaches the age of twenty-seven without having heard of pierced ears . However , it must not have seemed ridiculous to the woman he was addressing . She raised a finger to an earlobe in a startled , mesmerized way . She was spellbound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus ? Or his innocence , perhaps . He was a tourist on a female planet , was what he was saying . But he did n't realize he was saying it , and failed to understand the look she gave him . Or did n't care , if he did understand . Only one of Cody 's girlfriends had not been attracted to his brother . This was a social worker named Carol , or maybe Karen . Upon meeting Ezra , she had fixed him with a cool stare . Later , she had remarked to Cody that she disliked motherly men . " Always feeding , hovering , " she said ( for she 'd met him at his restaurant ) , " but acting so clumsy and shy , in the end it 's you that takes care of them . Ever notice that ? " However , she hardly counted ; Cody had so soon afterward lost interest in her . You might wonder why he went on making these introductions , considering his unfortunate experiences  --  the earliest dating from the year he turned fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , he lived in New York s City and his family lived in Baltimore ; he T. did n't really have to bring these women home on weekends . In fact , he often swore that he T. , would stop it . He would meet somebody , marry her , and not mention her even to his mother . But that would mean a lifetime of suspense . E He 'd keep watching his wife uncomfortably , 54 suspiciously . He 'd keep waiting for the inevitable  --  like Sleeping Beauty 's parents , waiting for the needle that was bound to prick her finger in spite of their precautions . He was thirty years old by now , successful in his business , certainly ready to marry . He considered his New York apartment temporary , a matter of minor convenience ; he had recently purchased a farmhouse in Baltimore County with forty acres of land . Weekends , he traded his slim gray suit for corduroys and lie roamed his property , making plans . There was a sunny backyard where his wife could have her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with children . He felt rich and lordly . Poor Ezra : all he had was that disorganized restaurant , in the cramped , stunted center of the city . Once , Cody invited Ezra to hunt rabbits with him in the woods behind the farm . It was n't a success . First Ezra fell into a yellow jackets ' nest . Then he got his rifle wet in the stream . And when they paused on a hilltop for lunch , he whipped out his battered recorder and commenced to tootling " Greensleeves , " scaring off all living creatures within a five-mile radius  --  which may have been his intention . Cody was n't even talking to him , at the end ; Ezra had to chatter on by himself . Cody stalked well ahead of him in total silence , trying to remember why this outing had seemed such a good idea . Ezra sang " Mister Rabbit . " " Every little soul , " he sang , blissfully off key , " must shine , shine . . .. " No wonder Cody was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he slept at night , he ground his teeth so hard that his jaws ached every morning . He pictured the woman as dark and biblical , because of her name : Ruth . Shadowed eyes and creamy skin . Torrents of loose black hair . Cody had a weakness for black-haired women ; he did n't like blondes at all . He pictured her bare-shouldered , in a red satin nightgown , and he crumpled Jenny 's letter roughly and dropped it in the wastebasket . The next day at work , Ruth 's image hung over him . He was doing a time-and-motion study of a power-drill factory in New Jersey . Joining object K to object L : right-hand transport unloaded , search , grasp , transport loaded . .. He passed down the assembly line with his clipboard , attracting hostile glances . Ruth 's black hair billowed in the rafters . Unavoidable delays : 3 . Avoidable delays : 9 . No doubt her eyes were plum-shaped , slightly tilted . No doubt her hands were heavily ringed , with long , oval fingernails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , there was a letter from Ezra . It was an invitation to his restaurant this coming Saturday night . Oh , Lord , not another of Ezra 's dinners . There would be toasts and a fumbling , sentimental speech leading up to some weighty announcement  --  in this case , his engagement . Cody thought of declining , but what good would that do ? Ezra would be desolate if a single person were missing . He 'd cancel the whole affair and reschedule it for later , and keep on rescheduling till Cody accepted . Cody might as well go and be done with it . Besides , he would n't at all mind meeting this Ruth . roDY followed Ezra to the far corner of the restaurant , where a RESERVED sign at upon a table . Jenny and their mother were n't there yet . Jenny , who 'd arrived on the afternoon train , had asked her mother 's help in shopping for a dress to be married in . " I hope they wo n't be late , " Ezra said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? " " Well , no problem if it 's only pot roast . " " It 's not only pot roast , " Ezra said . He sat in a chair . His suit had a way of waffling around him , as if purchased for a much larger man . " See , there 's this cook , this real country cook , and pot roast is really not the right name for what she does . It 's more like ? " " Here they come , " Cody said . Jenny and her mother were just walking across the dining room . Jenny 's lipstick was chewed off . Pearl 's hat was knocked crooked and her hair was frizzier than ever . " What took you so long ? " Ezra asked , jumping up . " We were starting to worry . " " Oh , this Jenny and her notions , " said Pearl . " Her size eight figure and no bright colors , no pastels , no gathers or puckers or trim , nothing to make her look fat , so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question took them all off guard . It was true , Cody saw . There were five plates and five crystal wineglasses . " How come ? " Pearl asked Ezra . " Oh ... I 'll get to that in a minute . Have a seat , Mother . " But she kept standing . " Then at last we find just the right thing , " she said . " A nice soft gray with a crocheted collar , Jenny all the way . It 's you , ' I tell her . And guess what she does . She has a tantrum in the middle of Hutzler 's department store . " " Not a tantrum , Mother , " Jenny told her . " I merely said ? " " Said , ' It is n't a funeral , Mother : I 'm not going into mourning . ' You 'd think I 'd chosen widow 's weeds . This was a nice pale gray , very ladylike , very suitable for a second marriage . " " Anthracite , " Jenny told Cody . " Pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . In other words : coal . Our mother thinks it suitable to marry me off in a coal-black wedding dress . " " Uh , " said Ezra , looking around at the other diners , " maybe we should be seated now . " But Pearl just stood straighter . " And then , " she told her sons , " then , without the slightest bit of thought , doing it only to spite me , she goes rushing over to the nearest rack and pulls out something white as snow . " " It was cream-colored , " Jenny said . " Cream , white  --  what 's the difference ? take this one , ' she says , and it 's not even the proper size , miles too big , had to be left at the store for alterations . " " I happened to like it , " Jenny said . " You were lost in it . " " It made me look thin . " " Maybe you could wear a shawl or something , brown , " said her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't wear a shawl at a wedding . " " Why not ? Or a little jacket , say a brown linen jacket . " " I look fat in jackets . " " Not in a short one , Chanel-type . " " I hate Chanel . " " Well , " said Pearl , " I can see that nothing will satisfy you . " " Mother , " Jenny said , " I 'm already satisfied . I 'm satisfied with my cream-colored dress , just the way it is . I love it . Will you please just get off my back ? " ' Did you hear that ? " Pearl asked her sons . " Well , I do n't have to stand here and take it . " And she turned and marched back across the dining room , erect as a little wind-up doll . Ezra said , " Huh ? " Jenny opened a compact , looked into it , and then snapped it shut , as if merely making certain she was still there . " Please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ezra asked . " Not on your life . " " You 're the one she fought with . 1 ca n't persuade her . " " Oh , Ezra , let 's for once just drop it , " Cody said . " I do n't think I 'm up to all this . " " What are you saying ? Not have dinner at all ? " " I 'm on a diet , anyhow , " Jenny told him . " But this is important ! It was going to be an occasion . Oh , just ... wait . Wait here a minute , will you ? " Ezra turned and rushed off to the kitchen . He returned immediately with a small person in overalls . It was a girl , Cody guessed  --  a weasel-faced little redhead . She followed Ezra jauntily , almost stiff-legged , wiping her palms on her backside . " I 'd like you to meet Ruth , " Ezra said . Cody said , " Ruth ? " " We 're getting married in September . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , congratulations , " and kissed Ruth 's bony , freckled cheek , and Cody said , " Uh , yes , " and shook her hand . There were calluses like pebbles on her palm . " How do , " she told him . He thought of the phrase " banty hen , " although he had never seen a banty hen . Or maybe she was more of a rooster . Her brisk , carroty hair was cut so short that it seemed too scant for her skull . Her blue eyes were round as marbles , and her skin was so thin and tight ( as if , like her hair , it had been skimped on ) that he could see the white cartilage across the bridge of her nose . " So , " he said , " Ruth . " He had the strangest feeling of loss . It was as if someone had died , or had left him forever  --  the beautiful , black-haired Ruth of his dreams . t T WORK that next week , charting the steps by which power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , dark Ruth fade from the raf-ters and hallways , until at last she was com-pletely gone and he forgot why she had moved him so . Now a new Ruth appeared . Skinny and boyish , overalls flapping around her shin-bones , she raced giggling down the assembly line with Ezra hot on her heels . Ezra 's hair was tousled . ( He was not immune at all , it appeared , but had only been waiting in his stubbornly trustful way for the proper person to arrive . ) Ruth 's lips were chapped and cracked . Her nails were bitten into tiny pink cushions and there were scrapes and burns across her knuckles , scars from her country cooking . Cody called his mother and said he 'd be down for the weekend . And would Ruth be around , did she think ? After all , he said , it was time he got to know his future sister-in-law . E ARRIVED on Saturday morning bringing flowers , copper-colored roses . He found Ruth and Ezra playing gin on the living-room floor . Ruth wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was so absorbed in her game that she hardly glanced up when Cody walked in . " Ruth , " he said , and he held out the flowers . " These are for you . " She looked at them , and then drew a card . " What are they ? " she asked . " Well , roses . " " Roses ? This early in the year ? " " Greenhouse roses . I especially ordered copper , to go with your hair . " " You leave my hair out of this , " she said . " Honey , he meant it as a compliment , " Ezra told her . " Oh . " " Certainly , " said Cody . " See , it 's my way of saying welcome . Welcome to our family , Ruth . " " Oh . Well , thanks . " " Cody , that was awfully nice of you , " Ezra said . " Gin , " said Ruth . er in the pocket of his shabby lumber jacket , and he and Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving the rice dish , Ruth said ; that always made the Arab family happy . She ran her fingers through her sprouty red hair . Cody , walking on the other side of her , felt her shift of weight when Ezra circled her with one arm and pulled her close . In the restaurant , she was a whirlwind . She spun and pounced and jabbed at a chicken casserole as if doing battle , while Cody watched her from a corner well out of the way . " Is this chicken some regional thing ? " he asked . " Taste , " she snapped , and she speared a piece and held it out to him . " I ca n't , " he said . " Why not ? " " I feel too full . " In fact , he felt full of her . Every spiky movement  --  slam of pot lid , toss of head  --  nourished him . It came to him like a gift , while he was studying her narrow back , that she actually wore an undershirt , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could make out the seams of it beneath the brown plaid . He filed the information with care , to be treasured once he was alone . The restaurant opened and customers began to trickle in . The large , beaming hostess seated them all in one area , as if tucking them under her wing . Then , when the first real flurry was over , Ruth and Ezra settled at the scrubbed wooden table in the center of the kitchen , and Cody joined them . Ezra ate some of Ruth 's chicken casserole . Ruth lit a small brown cigarette and tipped back in her chair to watch him . The cigarette smelled as if it were burning only by accident  --  like something spilled on the floor of an oven , or stuck to the underside of a saucepan . Cody , seated across from her , drank it in . " Eat , Cody , eat , " Ezra urged him . Cody just shook his head , not wanting to lose his chestful of Ruth 's smoke . They left the restaurant before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They took a roundabout route home , down a quiet one-way street , to drop Ruth off at the house where she rented a room . When Ezra accompanied her up the front steps , Cody waited on the curb . He watched Ezra kiss her good-night ? a bumbling , inadequate kiss , Cody judged it ; and he felt some satisfaction . Then Ezra rejoined him and galumphed along beside him , big-footed and blithe . From time to time , he hummed a few bars of something underneath his breath . When they were almost home ? passing houses totally dark , where everyone had long since gone to sleep  --  what should he do but pull out that damned recorder of his and start piping away . It was embarrassing . It was infuriating : " Le Godiveau de Poisson , " once again . Depend on Ezra , Cody thought , to have as his theme song a recipe for a seafood dish . He walked along in silence . hoping someone would call the police . Or at least that they 'd open a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one did . It was so typical : Ezra the golden boy , everybody 's favorite , tootling down the streets scot-free . ? HE FOLLOWING weekend , Cody drove Ruth out to see his farm . " I have seen all the farms I care to , " she said , but Ezra said , " Oh , you ought to go , Ruth . It 's pretty this time of year . " Ezra himself had to stay behind ; he was supervising the installation of a new meat locker for the restaurant . Cody had known that before he invited her . This time he brought her jonquils . She said , " I do n't know what I want with these ; there 's a whole mess in back by the walkway . " Cody smiled at her . He settled her in his Cadillac , which smelled of new leather . She looked unimpressed . Perversely , she was wearing a skirt , on the one occasion when jeans would have been more suitable . Her legs were very white , almost chalky . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , and her tattered sneakers were as small and stubby as a child 's . When they reached the farm he showed her around the grounds , where she stared a cow down and gave a clump of hens the evil eye . Then he led her into the house . He 'd bought it lock , stock , and barrel  --  complete with rickety furniture and kerosene stove . " I do plan to fix things up , " he told Ruth , " but I 'm waiting till I marry . I know my wife might like to have a say in it . " Ruth removed a window lock easily from its crumbling wooden sash . She turned it over and peered at the underside . " I want a wife very much , " said Cody . She put back the lock . " I hate to be the one to tell you , " she said , " but smell ' that smell ? Kind of sweetish smell ? You got dry rot here . " " Ruth , " he said , " do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Huh ? " " Your attitude . The way you put me off . You do n't think much of me , do you ? " he said . She gave him an edgy , skewed look , evasive , and moved away . " Oh , " she said , " I like you a fair amount . " " You do ? " " But I know your type , " she said . " What type ? " " There were plenty like you in my school , " she said . " Oh , sure ! Some in every class , on every team  --  tall and real good-looking , stylish , athletic , witty . Smooth-mannered boys that everything always came easy to , that always knew the proper way of doing things , and never dated any but the cheerleader girls , or the homecoming queen , or her maids of honor at the lowest . Passing me in the halls not even knowing who I was , nor guessing I existed . Or making fun of me sometimes , I 'm almost certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freckly face and my old red hair ? " " Laughing ! When have I ever done such a thing ? " " I 'm not naming you in particular , " she said , " but you sure do put me in mind of a type . " " Ruth . I would n't mock you . I think you 're perfect , " he said . " You 're the most beautiful woman I 've ever laid eyes on . " " See there ? " she asked , and she raised her chin , spun around , and marched out . She would n't answer anything else he said to her , all during the long drive home . T WAS a campaign , was what it was  --  a long and arduous battle campaign , extending through April and all of May . There were moments when he despaired . He 'd had too late a start , was out of the running ; he 'd wasted his time with those unoriginal , obvious brunettes whom he 'd thought he was so clever to snare while Ezra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewel . Lucky Ezra ! His whole life rested on luck , and Cody would probably never manage to figure out how he did it . Often , after leaving Ruth , Cody would be muttering to himself as he strode away . He would slam a fist in his palm or kick his own ear . But at the same time , he had an underlying sense of exhilaration . Yes , he would have to say that he 'd never felt more alive , never more eager for each new day . Now he understood why he 'd lost interest in Carol or Karen , what's-her-name , the social worker who had n't found Ezra appealing . She 'd made it too easy . What he liked was the competition , the hope of emerging triumphant from a neck-and-neck struggle with Ezra , his oldest enemy . He even liked biding his time . hiding his feelings from Ruth till the most advantageous moment . ( Was patience Ezra 's secret ? ) For of course , this was n't an open competition . One of the contestants did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cody , " Ezra said , " it 's been MING in his New York apartment , Cody went through the day 's mail . He scanned an ad for life insurance . He ripped open an envelope marked AMAZING OFFER ! and found three stationery samples and a glossy order blank . One sample was blue , with LMR embossed at the top . Another had a lacy PAULA , and the third was one of those letters that form their own envelopes when folded . The flap was printed with butterflies and MRS . HAROLD ALEXANDER III , 219 SAINT BEULAH BOULEVARD , DALLAS , TEXAS . He studied that for a moment . Then he took a pen from his shirt pocket and started writing in an unaccustomed , backhand slant : Dear Ruth , Just a line to say hey from all of us . How 's the job going ? What do you think of Baltimore ? Harold says ask if you met a young man yet . He had the funniest dream last night , dreamed he saw you with someone tall , black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , I certainly hope it 's a dream that comes true ! He signed the letter Lux , Sue ( Mrs. Harold Alexander III ) and sealed , stamped , and addressed it . Then he placed it in a business envelope and wrote a note to his old college roommate in Dallas , asking if he would please drop the enclosed in the nearest mailbox . The next morning he began another letter , on the sheet headed PAULA , In a curlicued script , he wrote : Dear Ruthie , You old thing , do n't you keep in touch with your friends anymore ? I told Mama the other day , Mama that Ruth Spivey has forgotten all about us I believe . Things here are not going too good . I guess you might have heard that me and Norman are separated . Ruthie stay clear of those pale blond thoughtful kind of men , they 're a real disappointment . Go for someone dark and interesting who will take you lots of places you 've never been . I 'm serious , I know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter he mailed from Pennsylvania , where he visited a packing-crate plant the following Tuesday . And on Wednesday , from New York , he sent the blue sheet with LMR at the top . Dear Ruth , Had lunch with Donna the other day and she told me you were going with a real nice fellow . Was kind of hazy on the particulars but when she said his name was Tull and he came from Baltimore I knew it must be Cody . Everybody here knows Cody , we all just love him , he really is a good man at heart and has been misjudged for years by people who do n't understand him . Well , Ruthie , I guess you 're smarter than I gave you credit for , I always thought you 'd settle for one of those dime-a-dozen blond types but now I see I was wrong . I 'll be waiting for the details . Love , Laurie May " You went too far with that last letter , " Ruth told him . " I do n't know what you 're talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watching her cube meat . She slammed her cleaver on the chopping board . " Do you realize , " she asked . " that I went ahead and answered that first note ? Not wanting someone to worry , I sent it back and said it was n't mine . there must be some mistake . And would 've sent the second back , too , only it did n't have a return address . Then the third comes ; well , you went too far . " " I tend to do that , " Cody said regretfully . Ruth slung the cleaver with a thunking sound . Cody was afraid the others  --  only a couple of salad boys , this early  --  would wonder what was wrong , but they did n't even look around . Ezra was out front , chalking up tonight 's menu . " Just what is your problem ? " Ruth asked him . " Do you have something against me ? You think I 'm some Garrett County hick that you do n't want marrying your brother ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cody said . " I love you . " " Huh ? " This was n't the moment he had planned , but he rushed on anyway , as if drunk . " I mean it , " he said , " I feel driven . I feel pulled . I have to have you . You 're all I ever think about . " She was staring at him , astonished , with one hand cupped to scoop the meat cubes into a skillet . " Ruth . I really , truly love you , " he said . " I 'm sick over you . I ca n't even eat . Look at me ! I 've lost eleven pounds . " He held out his arms , demonstrating . His jacket hung loose at the sides . Lately he 'd moved his belt in a notch ; his suits no longer fit so smoothly but seemed rumpled , gathered , bunchy . " It 's true you 're kind of skinny , " Ruth said slowly . " Even my shoes feel too big . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You have n't heard a word I said ! " " Over me , you said . You must be making fun . " " Ruth , I swear ? " he said . " You 're used to New York City girls , models , actresses ; you could have anyone . " " It 's you I 'll have . " She studied him a moment . It began to seem he 'd finally broken through ; they were havinga conversation . Then she said , " We got to get that weight back on you . " He groaned . " See there ? " she asked . " You never eat a thing I offer you . " " I ca n't , " he told her . " I do n't believe you ever once tasted my cooking . " She set the skillet aside and went over to the tall black kettle that was simmering on the stove . " Country vegetable soup , " she said , lifting the lid . " Really , Ruth ... " She filled a small crockery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , " she said . " Eat . When you 've tried it , I 'll tell you the secret ingredient . " Steam rose from the bowl , with a smell so deep and spicy that already he felt overfed . He accepted the spoon that she held out . He dipped it in the soup reluctantly and took a sip . " Well ? " she asked . " It 's very good , " he said . In fact , it was delicious , if you cared about such things . He took another mouthful . Ruth stood over him , her thumbs hooked into her blue-jean pockets . " Chicken feet , " she said . " Pardon ? " " Chicken feet is the secret ingredient . " He lowered the spoon and looked down into the bowl . " Eat up , " she told him . " Put some meat on your bones . " He dipped the spoon in again . After that , she brought him a salad and a basketful of rolls  --  a recipe from home , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she watched him . When she brought him more butter for his rolls , she leaned close over him and he felt the warmth she gave off . She sat down next to Cody , hooking her combat boots on the rung of his chair and hugging her ribs . Cody cut into a huge wedge of pie and gave some thought to food to its inexplicable , loaded meaning in other people 's lives . Could n't you classify a person , he wondered , purely by examining his attitude toward food ? Look at Cody 's mother  --  a nonfeeder if ever there was one . Even back in his childhood , when they 'd depended on her for nourishment why , mention you were hungry and she 'd suddenly act rushed and harassed , fretful , out of breath , distracted . He remembered her coming home from work in the evening and tearing irritably around the kitchen . Tins toppled out of the cupboards and fell all over  --  pork ' n ' beans , Spam , oily tuna fish , peas canned olive-drab . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She whimpered when she burned things . Her only seasonings were salt and pepper ; her only gravy was Campbell 's cream of mushroom soup , undiluted . And till Cody was grown , he had assumed that roast beef had to be stringy  --  not something you sliced , but a leathery dry object that you separated with a fork , one strand from the other , and dropped with a clunk upon your plate . Biting into Ruth 's flaky , shattering piecrust , Cody considered his mother 's three children ? Jenny , for instance , with her everlasting diets . And Cody himself was not much different , when you came right down to it . It seemed that food did n't count with him ; food was something required by others , so that for their sakes  --  on dates , at business luncheons  --  he would obligingly order a meal for himself just to keep them company . Yes , only Ezra , he would say , had managed to escape all this . Ezra was so impervious  --  so thickheaded , really ; nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his mother 's cooking or his own . He liked anything that was offered him , especially bread  --  would have to watch his weight as he got older . But above all else , he was a feeder . He would set a dish before you and then stand there with his face expectant , his hands clasped tightly under his chin , his eyes following your fork . There was something tender , almost loving , about his attitude toward people who were eating what he 'd cooked them . Like Ruth , Cody thought . He asked her for another slice of pie . ORNINGS , now , he called from New York , often getting her landlady out of bed ; and Ruth , when she an- swered , was still creaky-voiced from sleep or was it from bewilderment , even now ? Reluctantly , each time , she warmed to his questions , speaking shortly at first . Yes , she was fine . The restaurant was fine . Dinner last night had gone well . And then ( letting her sentences stretch gradually longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) she told him that this house was starting to wear her down  --  creepy boarders padding around in their slippers at all hours , no one ever going anywhere , landlady planted eternally in front of her TV . This landlady , a widow , believed that Perry Como 's eyebrows quirked upward as they did because he was by nature a bass , and singing such high notes gave him constant pain ; she had heard that Arthur Godfrey , too , had been enduring constant pain for years , smiling a courageous smile and wheeling about on his stool because the slightest step would stab him like a knife . Yes , everything , to Mrs. Pauling , was a constant pain ; life was a constant pain , and Ruthhad started looking around her and wondering how she stood this place . Weekends  --  Friday and Saturday nights  --  Ruth tore through the restaurant kitchen slapping haunches of beef and whipping egg whites . Ezra worked more quietly . Cody sat at the wooden table . Now and then , Ruth would place some new dish in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every mouthful was a declaration of love . Ruth knew that . She was tense and watchful . She gave him sideways , piercing glances when he forked up one of her dumplings , and he was careful to leave nothing on his plate . Then on Sunday mornings , yellow summer mornings at her boardinghouse , he rang her doorbell and pulled her close to him when she answered . Any time he kissed her , he was visited by the curious impression that some other self of hers was still moving through the house behind her , spunky and lighthearted and uncatchable even yet , checking under pot lids , slamming cupboard doors , humming and tossing her head and wiping her hands on her blue jeans . DO N'T understand , " Ezra told them . " Let me start over , " said Cody . Ezra said , " Is this some kind of a joke ? Is that what it is ? What is it ? " " Ruth and I ? " Cody began . But Ruth said , " Ezra , honey . Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy suit that Cody had bought her to go away in , and high-heeled shoes with slender straps . Her freckles stood out sharply . She said , " Ezra , we surely never planned on this . We never had the least intention , not me or Cody neither one . " Ezra waited , evidently still not comprehending . He was backed against the huge old restaurant stove , as if retreating from their news . " It just happened , like , " said Ruth . " You do n't know what you 're saying , " said Ezra , " Ezra , honey ? " " You would never do this . It 's not true . " " See , I do n't know how it came about but me and Cody .. and I should 've told you sooner but I kept thinking , oh , this is just some ... I mean , this is silly ; he 's so sophisticated , he is n't someone for me ; this is just some ... daydream , see ... " " There 's bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel real bad about it , Ezra . " " Pm sure understand in a minute , " he said . " Just give me time . Just wait a minute . Let me think it through . " They waited , but he did n't say anything more . He pressed two fingers against his forehead , as if working out some complicated puzzle . After a while , Cody touched Ruth 's arm . She said , " Well , Ezra , goodbye , I guess . " Then she and Cody left . In the car , she cried a little  --  not making any fuss but sniffling quietly and keeping her face turned toward the side window . " Are you all right ? " Cody asked . She nodded . " You 're sure you still want to go on with this . " She nodded again . She took off one of her gloves , already gray at the seams , and crumpled it into a ball and blotted both her eyes . Near Penn Station , Cody found a parking lot that offered weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling by train , but worth it for Ruth 's sake ; she 'd never set foot on a train before . She was already perking up . She asked him if he thought there 'd be a dining car  --  an " eating car , " she called it . Cody said he imagined so . He accepted the ticket the parking attendant gave him and slid out from behind the steering wheel , grunting a little ; lately he 'd put on a few pounds around the waist . He took Ruth 's suitcase from the trunk . Ruth was n't used to high heels and she hobbled along unsteadily . " I hope to get the knack of these things before long , " she told Cody . " You do n't have to wear them , you know . " " Oh , I surely do , " she said . Cody guided her into the station . The sudden , echoing coolness seemed to stun her into silence . She stood looking around her while Cody went to the ticket line . A plump young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand . " Cody Tull ! " she said . " Um ? " " I 'm Jane Lowry . Remember me ? " " Oh , Jane ! Jane Lowry ! Well , good to see you , how nice to ... and is this your little girl ? " " Yes , say hello to Mr. Tull , Betsy . Mr. Tull and Mommy used to go to school together . " Cody said , " Well , what a ? " " Remember the day I came to visit you , uninvited ? " she asked . She laughed , and he saw , in the tilt of her head , a flash of the young girl he had known . She lived on Bushnell Street , he remembered now ; she had had the most beautiful hair , which still showed its chips of gold light although she wore it short now . " I had such a crush on you , " she said . " Lord , I made a total fool of myself . " " You played a game of checkers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My brother . " " You had a brother ? " " I certainly did ; do . You played checkers with him all afternoon . " " How funny ; I thought you only had a sister . What was her name ? Jenny . But I 'd forgotten you had a brother . " Cody opened his mouth to speak , but it was his turn at the window . And by the time he 'd bought his tickets , Jane was gone . He did n't see her again  --  though he looked for her on the train  --  but it was odd how she 'd plunged him into the past . Swaying on the seat next to Ruth , holding her small , rough hand but finding very little to say to her , he was startled by fragments of buried memories . The scent of chalk in geometry class ; the balmy , laden feeling of the last day of school every spring ; the crack of a baseball bat on the playground . He found himself in a summer evening at a drive-in hamburger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its hot , salty smell of French fries , and all his friends horsing around at the curb . He could hear an old girlfriend from years ago , her droning , dissatisfied voice : " You ask me to the movies and I say yes and then you change your mind and ask me bowling instead and I say yes to that but you say wait , let 's make it another night , as if anything you can have is something it turns out you do n't want ... " He heard his mother telling Jenny not to slouch , telling Cody not to swear , asking Ezra why he would n't stand up to the neighborhood bully . " I 'm trying to get through life as a liquid , " Ezra had said , and Cody ( trying to get through life as a rock ) had laughed ; he could hear himself still . " Why are n't cucumbers prickly anymore ? " he heard Ezra ask . And , " Cody ? Do n't you want to walk to school with me ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childish wrist awkwardly angled ; he saw him running for the telephone ? " I 'll get it ! I 'll get it ! " ? hopeful and joyous , years and years younger . He remembered Carol , or was it Karen , reciting Ezra 's faults  --  a motherly man , she 'd said ; what had she said ? ? and it occurred to him that the reason he had dropped her was she ? really had n't understood Ezra ; she had n't appreciated what he was all about . Then Ruth squeezed his hand and said , " I intend to ride trains forever ; it 's so much better than the bus . Is n't it , Cody ? Cody ? Is n't it ? " The train rounded a curve with a high , thin , whistling sound that took him by surprise . He honestly believed , for an instant , . that what he 'd heard was music  --  a tune piped , a burble of notes , a little scrap of melody floating by on the wind and breaking his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
