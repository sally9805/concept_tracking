Bikini-clad women sipping vodka on an ocean liner in the Caribbean . Crates of computers being unloaded in Hong Kong harbor . A cruise ship offering three- month tours with elegant accommodations . These are not the images people conjure up when they think of the Soviet menace . But the Soviet Union 's fleet of about 2,500 merchant ships , now the world 's sixth largest , has been invading both cargo and cruise markets around the world , underbidding competitors by 40% and more . In the past two decades , the Soviet Union has doubled the number of its ships and tripled the tonnage of its fleet . Meanwhile , the U.S. , which is ranked No. 8* worldwide , has sold or scrapped 75% of its ships and reduced its tonnage by nearly a third . <P> Some nations see the Soviet practice of underbidding liner conferences , which are legally accepted price-fixing cartels , as deliberately predatory . When Britain took the Queen Elizabeth II out of commercial service to send troops to the Falkland Islands in 1982 , the Soviets moved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruise market from 10% to 42% . In France , about 80% of imported oil is carried by Soviet tankers , while French ships transport less than 1% . Even the Japanese have been hurt . Since 1981 , the Soviets have snatched an estimated 10% of the cargo trade between Japan , Australia and New Zealand . <P> Soviet ships can afford to underbid other fleets because they are state insured , fueled by cheap domestic oil and manned <P> by sailors who work for one-fourth the $1,110-a-month wages of U.S. merchant seamen . Even when the ships operate at a loss , they provide the Kremlin with badly needed foreign currency ( more than $2 billion in 1984 ) . Their military usefulness is indisputable . Several Soviet liners are equipped with side ports for vehicles , which are of little use on a cruise but of great value for troop carriers . <P> The Soviet cruise fleet now ranks third worldwide , with 36 vessels of 1,000 tons or more , compared with the U.S. fleet , which has dwindled to six . Sailing from Genoa , Tilbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15% to 20% below those of most Western ships . Travelers give Soviet cruises high marks . A group from Lisieux , France , who sailed the Norwegian fjords on the Leonid Brezhnev in May , was enchanted by everything from crew members , who danced " Russian , " to inexpensive vodka , and frog 's legs for dinner . <P> Soviet ships were barred from U.S. ports as a result of the 1979 Afghanistan invasion . But in Europe , saying bon voyage under a Red star is no longer a novelty . Western companies sending cargo overseas have also jumped aboard cut- rate Soviet ships . Their governments have been slow to respond to the Soviet merchants ' tactics . The Japanese , the Australians and several West European nations complain that the Soviets have broken understandings on shipping policies and rates . None , however , has found a means to enforce the pacts . For now , maritime nations seem likely to find that ships flying the Hammer and Sickle are an increasingly dominant presence in their ports . <P> FOOTNOTE : *The top ten shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece , Japan , Norway , U.S.S.R. , United Kingdom , U.S. , France , Italy . Several are so-called flags of convenience , used by shippers to hire low-paid foreign sailors .
