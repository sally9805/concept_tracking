txt " SIX O'CLOCK and All 's Well " Is a fluctuating look at , what goes into , and comes out of , a typical local nightly broadcast . It 's so revealing , I 'm surprised to see it on TV . It 's so revealing , you may watch it and never again be quite so naive , quite so believing , alma what you , see on TV news again . That 's because it gives you a remarkable behind-thescenes look at what you do n't see on TV news  --  the shortcuts , the manipulation , and the way reporters tend to shape a story by deleting some bits of information and staging others , all in the name of better broadcasting . It 's a funny , almost satirical look through the TV , News Looking Mass , a peek at the Wizards of Oz , n rare opportunity to notice that the Empe ? or-Reporters we all depend on to tell us the whole truth and nothing but are actually wearing very few clothes . And not dealing with the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 p.m . Friday on WPM-Channel 11 , Robert Spencer focuses on WABC 's Eyewitness News operation in New York . It 's May , 1977 , with Roger Grimsby and Bill Betttel coanchoring , but it could be any Tv newsroom in any big station in the country . The struggle , we hear , is the same . It 's the reporters ' need  --  some of them  --  to feel like good , responsible journalists versus Tv station managements ' need to be good , responsible bottom-line businessmen in light of the public 's need ? so the insidious News Doctors say  --  to be amused and entertained . First , the businessmen . The news director of WABC is clear about his priorities , and he 's only too happy to tick them off for Spencer 's eager camera : Production . Style . Brevity . Those are the most important things , Ron Tindiglia believes , and those are the things on his mind . The size of that mind is revealed , I think , in subtle ways , and it 's that subtlety and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " work so well . ' ' there 's not that much time for II reporter to study a story , " the voiceovcr of management reveals . " We give them about two minutes . . . . " PETER BANNON LS II %YAM News reporter , and he wishes that his editors cared more about content . About quality . About giving a reporter time to do his homework . I think you will be surprised how candid he is when he explains very matter ? of-factly that in Ills business , a story 's value and content are rarely discussed . " We 're never edited for content , " he says . All his bosses care about i5 " how long it is ... and is it exciting . No one edits in television for content , and it 's a mistake . " But is it a mistake ? Not from a management point of view . They want the largest audience possible , mettle way to get that , the News Doctors assure them , is to be brief , be entertaining , be exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the " fascination valpe " of a story . He likes stories with high fascination valties . And if the sonic of the weightier journalistic considerations get lost in the shuffle , well , that 's show business . " Journalism might have to bend its definition for TV ... , " Cooper says . BANNON KNOWS he must bend , too , If he 's going to make it in TV journalism . As the TV news consultants say  --  and Bannon does a terrifyingly good Imitation of them , " the medicine men of TV " he calls them ? he must learn to relax . To relate . He must be active , appear Involved . He must be brief , and above all , he must not clutter up the airwaves with facts . Facts and details take up airtitne , and they only get in the way . Bannon may make fun of the news analysts , but he has learned their lessons well . ' " The more facts you put in , " he says , " the less effective you are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this film because he does n't preach , he does n't lecture , he just shows us the way it is . And the way it is is different , very much more human , than you might expect . In one segment , tie first shows on a feature report by Eyewitness News reporter Milton Lewis about 1111 under taker who owns racehorses . THEN WE CO hack In time and follow Lewls as he sets up the story . and I do mean set tip . It would be nice , he thinks , to have a shot of the guy , Ray Meachem , driving to the racetrack in his hearse . Only Meachem does n't take hiS hearse to the racetrack . Lewis asks him to drive around the block instead . He knows he can get what he needs that way . Later , Lewis is trying to get what he needs in a one . on-one interview with Meachem . Ile 's frustrated be . cause Monello ' ) is freezing on camera . ' fhere 's no time for Meachem to thaw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want from you is .. . . " Another wooderful sequence involves reporter Gloria Rojas , who , like her colleague Bannon , is candid about her job in a way that newsreporters seldom are . We follow her and her crew as they cover a breaking news assignment , a ( lead body found at Orchard Beach . She has gotten a few lines of wire copy but that 's all . At the scene she directs her cameraman to shoot the body . " I do n't ( is pictures of open dead bodies , " he says . " Why not ? " " I loot like to do it . . . . " take from a wide angle : " she says quickly . " But take it ! " A MOMENT LATER she 's interviewing the police captain . She asks for a description , identifying marks , and then in the must innocent , unassuming voice possible : " Do the handcuffs 011 him mean anything . . . in terms of a crime , family , drugs ? " The police captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . Please , he says , no mention of the . yictint 's possible involvement in the Purple Gang . On the news that night , we see Rojas report . There is no mention of the Purple Gang . Though much of the hour is high on fascination values , it does : sake a rather chilling statement toward the end . " The revolution will not he televised , " a voice says . Television is not good at riling people up , at getting them to march . Indeed , " ' Television may be the best instrument of big government and capitalism that has come along in a long time because it gives the impression that everything is OK when maybe it is and maybe it 's not .
