Diana , Princess of Wales , turned 26 last week . She celebrated in a private room at a London restaurant with Prince Charles , Prince Andrew and his wife . The British tabloids , however , toasted Diana 's birthday in a very different way . WHAT HAPPENS IF CHARLES AND DI DIVORCE ? bannered the sensationalist Sun across a two-page spread . " It 's unthinkable , " noted the paper in considerably smaller type . " But anything goes with the royals these days . " Declared the rival Daily Express : " She 's 26 today , far from shy and surrounded by Hip Hoorays who dance and joke with her till dawn . " <P> The royal family has never lacked for ink in the British press , especially ! in the flashier tabloids whose rival scoops are sometimes mountains built from one grain of fact . Diana , in particular , attracts headlines : over the course of her six-year marriage to Prince Charles , she has been reported pregnant countless times , has spent a king 's ransom on clothes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been feasting on an unusually large banquet of negative stories about the younger royals , including once unthinkable innuendos about ( gasp ! ) Diana 's marital fidelity . <P> Rumors of a rift between the pensive , polo-loving Charles , 38 , and his much younger , more pop-oriented wife have been played up in the papers for months . After spotting Di at rock concerts and discos with a number of male escorts , reporters zeroed in on a single putative love interest : Philip Dunne , 28 , a London bachelor who works at the investment banking firm of S.G. Warburg . Never mind that Dunne already has a pretty girlfriend named Katya Grenfell . Young , successful and with a vague resemblance to Actor Christopher Reeve ( Superman ) , Dunne fit the role perfectly . POW ! SUPERMAN PHIL IS DIANA 'S NEW PAL blared the News of the World . <P> In true British tabloid style , no detail was spared . Several papers gleefully reported how Dunne and the princess danced until dawn at a wedding after Charles had left . Nigel Dempster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Daily Mail on Sunday that Di spent the weekend with Dunne and other guests at his family 's country home while both his parents and Charles were away . When Diana was photographed at a David Bowie concert next to a handsome man , several papers trumpeted that it was Dunne . It was not ; Di 's companion turned out to be an officer in the Queen 's Household Cavalry . The mistake did not deter at least one paper from offering some friendly advice . " Have an early night , Diana , " urged a Star columnist . " We really ca n't have a Princess of Wales hoofing it around town with a clutch of eligible escorts , while her two small children are left at home with their dad . " <P> Palace correspondents claim that Diana has shed her early shyness and credit her new high spirit to her sister-in-law the Duchess of York , formerly Sarah Ferguson and known in headlines simply as " Fergie . " Already 26 when she married Charles ' younger brother Prince Andrew last year , Fergie arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a relaxed , fun-loving demeanor . Di and Fergie made the papers at the annual Ascot races last month when , giggling , they prodded acquaintances from behind with their umbrellas . Later , when Princess Michael of Kent walked by , Diana reportedly greeted her with a wolf whistle .
