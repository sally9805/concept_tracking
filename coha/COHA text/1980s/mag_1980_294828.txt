Reagan confronts low growth , high inflation and steep interest rates <P> " I think that we are at a very major watershed in this country . The chips are down . We either make a significant turn at this point , or we are going to be fighting economic stagnation for the next decade . " <P> <P> The speaker was Republican Economist Alan Greenspan , but the sentiment was shared by each of his colleagues on the TIME Board of Economists , which gathered last week to examine the economic outlook for 1981 . To a man , the board agreed that the weakened U.S. economy simply can not endure many more shocks and setbacks like those that have afflicted it for the past two years . The tone of the meeting , the fourth and final of a troubled year , was similar to that set by David Stockman , Ronald Reagan 's designated new budget director , and New York Congressman Jack Kemp . Three weeks ago , they sent Reagan a 23-page memo in which they called for the declaration of a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Those two words already threaten to become what might be called the economic hallmark of 1981 . <P> There was worry aplenty at last week 's meeting about how much time the incoming Administration will have to return the economy to longterm , noninflationary growth . While board Republicans argued that the Reagan strategy of deep cuts in both taxes and Government spending is crucial to economic recovery , Democrats on the board considered the approach both impractical and politically naive . They feel that it could wind up actually quickening the tempo of economic upheaval and causing even more inflation . <P> Looming over every current discussion of the U.S. economy is deep concern about the nation 's increasingly mercurial interest rates . The prime lending rate that big commercial banks charge their best corporate customers jumped last week to 21.5% , breaking the 20% peak of last April and heightening fears of a renewed economic downturn . The economists on TIME 'S board predicted that the rate is likely to go as high as 23% early next year . <P> For this and other reasons , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months ago as a period of at least slow recovery from 1980 's slump , will be another year of recession . Board members differed on the timing and severity of a 1981 decline , but agreed that a contraction is now all but unavoidable . Yet they believed that the 1981 slump will not be as sharp as this year 's , when the GNP in the second quarter declined at an annual rate of 9.6% . Republican Conservative Monetarist Beryl Sprinkel , chief economist for Chicago 's Harris Trust &; Savings Bank , predicted that the economy will show about 3.9% real growth on an annual basis for the last three months of 1980 and then increase at a 4% yearly rate during the first quarter of 1981 . Then he sees business slipping back into a recession during the six months between April and October . <P> By contrast , Liberal Democrat <P> Walter Heller , a former economic adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson , warned that the economy is already weakening , and will wind up registering around 2% in real annual growth during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity during the first three months of 1981 will decline approximately 1.5% and remain essentially stagnant for the following quarter .
