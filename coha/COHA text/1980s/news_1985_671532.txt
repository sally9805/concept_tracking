By the time the lock is reopened - perhaps by Nov. 6 - the owners of more than 70 ships stranded by the accident will have lost about $350 , 000 in revenues for each ship. // The accident here is the second to rock the St. Lawrence Seaway in less than a year . Last year , a lift-bridge jammed at Valleyfield , Quebec , causing an 18-day shutdown and costing shippers a total of more than $40 million in lost business. // // Mounting Worries // As a result , there are mounting worries that the seaway , portions of which are more than a half century old , is fraying at the edges because of inadequate maintenance. // " It ' s very worrying , " said Frank Nicol , manager of marine operations for the Shipping Federation of Canada . And although T. Norman Hall , president of the Dominion Marine Association , a group of 16 companies operating 133 ships in the seaway , thinks the latest episode is a " freak accident , " he still suspects " something screwy. " // Answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future investigations by Canada and the United States , which jointly administer the seaway , officially opened by President Eisenhower and Queen Elizabeth in 1959 .

The St. Lawrence Seaway Authority , the Canadian agency overseeing the seaway , says traffic through mid-October is down 25 percent from last year , which itself was down by more than 20 percent from 1977 , the best year . The agency predicts traffic growth for the rest of this century will be less than 2 percent , compared with average growth of 5 percent over the first 25 years. // This year , the seaway ' s operating deficit was expected to widen to $10 million to $12 million ( Canadian ) , from $2. 6 million last year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the Canadian Government carries through on its threat to recoup a $37 million surplus the seaway accumulated during better years , the effect could be a fare increase as high as 28 percent. // " The seaway is becoming noncompetitive , and any increase in costs is just going to exacerbate that problem , " said Donald S. Rothwell , president of the Great Lakes Waterways Development Association , an organization of industries dependent on seaway shipments . <> <> Poor Grain Harvests Cited // Many of the seaway ' s problems have resulted from poor grain harvests in Canada , and a contracting steel industry , although it has also been hurt by marine technology and economic factors. // Canadian grain shipments account for one-third of the traffic . But both this year and last , Western Canadian farmers have been beset by droughts , locusts and rainfall at harvest time . In addition , Canada is facing increasing competition for grain sales . Also , Washington ' s recent subsidization of grain exports could steal traditional Canadian markets. // Iron ore shipments from Quebec and Labrador to American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeing to join their northern neighbor in what is mainly a Canadian waterway - also fell to 17 million metric tons last year , from more than 20 million in the 1970 ' s , as the steel industry slumped. // Marine technological change has also hurt , particularly the big increase in ship sizes . The newer , larger ships are much better suited for carrying containers , which can be more easily and quickly transferred to and from trains and trucks at ocean ports . <> <> No Alternative for Canada // Particularly for its grain shipments , Canada has no alternative to the seaway in shipping to such destinations as the Soviet Union , which is believed to have purchased four million tons of Canadian wheat just before the collapse of the seaway wall . America does have alternatives . American grain once shipped via the St. Lawrence has dropped to 2 million tons annually , from as much as 9 million tons a decade ago .

America , with two , collects the remaining 27 percent and foots the bill for that portion of costs. // James L. Emery , administrator of the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation , the American seaway agency , is fighting the declining traffic by insisting on no fare increases in the jointly administered portion , at least through 1986 . <> <> Self Supporting // But the Progressive Conservative Party Government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has taken the view that the seaway should be self-supporting as soon as possible .

While fees on the joint portion of the seaway can not be increased without Washington ' s agreement , Canada is free to raise fares on the Welland Canal portion , which it administers independently. // The accident in the Welland canal has spurred a careful scrutiny of the physical health of the entire seaway . Mr. Emery has asked Congress for $40 million to do all the concrete repair work on the American locks at one time , rather than piecemeal. // For the Canadians , who have tended to fix just what needs fixing at any given time , such a comprehensive program would be much more expensive , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
