On chatting and busing <P> Ever since the landmark Miranda decision in 1966 , police have been prohibited from formally interrogating any person they take into custody if he invokes his right to remain silent until his lawyer is on hand . But does that mean officers can not try to maneuver a suspect into speaking up about his crime in , say , casual chitchat ? Yes indeed , the Supreme Court said last week . In a 6-to-3 ruling in a Rhode Island murder case , the Justices declared that Miranda bars " any words or actions ... that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect . " <P> In the case under question , the court upheld the conviction of a man who , his lawyers argued , had been the victim of a police ploy to get him to incriminate himself . The defendant , Thomas J. Innis , was picked up by Providence police several days after he killed a cab driver with a shotgun , which he subsequently hid . On the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the handicapped children at a school near the arrest site : " God forbid one of them might find a weapon with shells and they might hurt themselves . " Innis spoke up and directed the officers to the shotgun . His conviction at trial was overturned by the Rhode Island Supreme Court on the grounds that key evidence , including the gun , was obtained improperly . <P> While supporting a broad definition of what constitutes interrogation , the court in last week 's ruling decided that the police had not infringed on Innis ' rights . In the majority opinion , Justice Potter Stewart observed that the patrolmen had no reason to think Innis was unusually disoriented or particularly susceptible to observations about the welfare of the handicapped children ; the officers ' " offhand remarks " therefore should not be viewed as a form of interrogation or its " functional equivalent . " Two of the dissenting Justices , Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan , felt the remarks should indeed have been read as an appeal to the suspect 's conscience . But Justice John Paul Stevens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a " plain departure " from Miranda 's principles . <P> In another key decision , the U.S. Supreme Court last week affirmed a lower-court ruling that rejected a plan to bus children between Atlanta 's predominantly black schools and the mainly white institutions in nine surrounding suburban districts . The decision , which was not accompanied by a written opinion outlining the court 's reasoning , was a blow to the flagging hopes of school-integration supporters that the Justices might be receptive to cross-district busing plans now before various federal courts . The advocates argue such broader plans are necessary because the white flight to the suburbs has left central-city school districts so heavy with minorities that integration becomes meaningless . <P> Undeterred , the Justice Department asked a federal court in Houston three days later to integrate the city 's school system with 22 surrounding districts . The agency argues that Houston 's situation differs from Atlanta 's because some districts in the Atlanta case had set up desegregation programs , while so far integration efforts in the Houston area consist of a voluntary-busing plan that the Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
