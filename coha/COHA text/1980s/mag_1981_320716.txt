MCI battles with AT &T; <P> A Lilliputian among telephone companies ( 1980 revenues : $205 million ) , MCI has spent most of the past decade battling the industry 's Gulliver , AT &T; ( 1980 revenues : $50 billion ) . Not only that , but the tiny competitor has often been successful . Since its founding in 1968 , MCI has steadily chipped away at Ma Bell 's lucrative monopoly in long-distance business calls . Now , with the help of American Express , it is aggressively entering the long-distance market for household phone calls . <P> In an experiment begun last month , Amex is offering MCI 's cut-rate telephone service to about 120,000 of its 9.5 million cardholders . Early interest has been encouraging . The MCI offer has drawn three times the usual response for a direct-mail campaign . The new agreement will enable American Express to move deeper into the communications business , where it has already been active through a cable TV partnership with Warner Communications . It will also help MCI by giving the company a new market for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " With its cardholders , American Express can fill our phone system for the next couple of years . " <P> Washington , D.C.-based MCI was founded by McGowan , 53 , a Harvard Business School-trained entrepreneur who correctly foresaw a market for cheaper long-distance phone service using new microwave technology . In 1972 , MCI began selling business clients its telephone service between a few heavy-traffic cities , including New York , St. Louis and <P> Chicago . The calls are beamed by microwave among the 3,200 communities in the MCI network , then transferred to local Ma Bell lines and carried to customers . <P> Modern technology and lower overhead have dramatically reduced the cost of long-distance calls for MCI 's clients . For example , a 4-minute daytime business call between New York and Boston costs Bell customers $1.74 , but those who use MCI only $1.28 . <P> The new company , though , had to file long pleas with the Federal Communications Commission and wage endless court battles with AT &T; before its service could be established . In landmark decisions in 1969 and 1971 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break Ma Bell 's 50-year monopoly on long-distance calls . Last June a Chicago federal court ruled that AT &T; had to pay MCI $1.8 billion in damages , because the telephone giant would not allow it to use AT &T; lines to relay calls between 1971 and 1975 . It was the biggest antitrust judgment ever , and AT &T; has appealed the ruling . <P> On the basis of its success in attracting 85,000 business customers , MCI is now going after private clients . Since last March , MCI has used sometimes stinging advertisements to attract 200,000 new household customers . Example : " If you 're still using Bell for long-distance calls , you must be one of their major stockholders . " <P> Subscribers pay a $5 or $10 monthly fee for access to the MCI telephone network . <P> By punching 22 digits ( twice as many as the usual eleven ) on a push-button phone , customers are connected with a computer that routes their calls along MCI 's microwave relay system .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
