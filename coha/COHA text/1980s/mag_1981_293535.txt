MACBETH by William Shakespeare <P> The Vivian Beaumont Theater at Manhattan 's Lincoln Center is the dramatic equivalent of Russian roulette . It is played with breathtaking regularity at this house , which in 15 years of fitful existence has never had any precisely defined aesthetic goal or financial stability . As a result , the persisting apprehension is that any given season , even any given production , may be the last . <P> After Joseph Papp relinquished his caretakership in 1977 , the theater was dark for three years . Relit this season under the overall command of Richmond Crinkley the Vivian Beaumont is gambling on name-brand appeal involving such diverse talents as Woody Allen , Edward Albee and Ellis Rabb . One of the group , Sarah Caldwell. best known for staging operas , makes her Broadway directorial debut with Macbeth . While this production may not kindle a blaze of excitement it is engaging enough to pose no threat of killing off the Beaumont . <P> Caldwell stresses the lust for power and the power of lust . Her casting emphasizes the second even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and so full of animal magnetism played the two key roles Philip Anglim , best known for his work as John Merrick in The Elephant Man brings to his Macbeth the boundless energy of a fledgling Henry V. The shapely Maureen Anderman makes Lady Macbeth a hot-blooded sex symbol . One can visualize the pair being written up in the gossip columns as smart society 's latest darlings and very much on the rise . <P> This sort of approach does have its drawbacks . The desolating pathos of madness is missing from Anderman 's mad scene . Nothing in Anglim 's countenance suggests that he has " supp 'd full with horrors " But the political core of the play remains intact . Macbeth is a politician 's tragedy . It is full of the cagey schemes and ruthless deeds by which men seek to attain and hold power , and of the cruel downfall which they court . <P> Caldwell is willing to sacrifice some of the Shakespeare text for pageantry and graphic effects . The guests at the feast where Banquo 's ghost appears are seated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Da Vinci 's The Last Supper , thus carrying resonances of sacrilege . <P> The crowned heirs of Banquo , foretold by the three witches , march with a stately heraldic tread across a narrow catwalk that spans the upper rear stage like a suspension bridge . In these and other scenes , the director groups and separates her players with a painter 's eye Individual playgoers may cavil at some of the liberties that Caldwell takes with Shakespeare , but few could deny that she represents a fresh , colorful and audacious directorial presence in the theater. - By T.E .
