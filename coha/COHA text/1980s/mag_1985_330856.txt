As the founder and owner of ComputerLand , William Millard , 53 , built a billion-dollar business on an old-fashioned notion : it is better to be feared than loved . Since the firm 's start in 1976 , Millard has ruled his 1,100 employees and more than 800 franchisees with an autocrat 's hand , making unilateral decisions and railing against anyone who challenged his judgment . Until recently , that style worked wonders . ComputerLand ( 1984 sales : $1.4 billion ) is the world 's largest chain of computer stores , with 820 outlets in 24 countries , including China . Profits are expected to reach $20 million this year . Millard , who is probably worth more than $500 million , should be a contented man . <P> But the hard-driving entrepreneur is now in retreat . Last week , in a coup engineered by angry franchisees , Millard was forced to step down as ComputerLand 's chief executive officer . He and his daughter Barbara , 27 whom Millard installed as president last November , relinquished all day-to-day operating control of the Oakland-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 95% of ComputerLand , is also scrambling to overturn a March verdict in which a California jury awarded 20% of the company 's shares to a group of investors that includes a former employee . The judgment ordered Millard to pay $115 million in punitive damages for refusing to deliver stock owed to the investors . It was one of the stiffest such awards in California history . Millard must post a $25 million bond by early November to appeal the ruling . <P> Millard 's corporate empire has been sagging as well . ComputerLand faces fierce competition from rival retailers like Entre Computer Centers . With a computer-industry slump slowing sales , ComputerLand 's franchisees besieged Millard and his daughter to reduce their royalty fees , which range from 5% to 8% . Some franchisees claimed that ComputerLand has not honored its pledge to sell computers at cost to franchisees . When the franchisees threatened to sue to enforce the company 's contracts , the Millards felt they had no choice but to give up control of their firm . <P> Former ComputerLand executives insist that Millard 's imperiousness created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says Henry Fiur , a senior vice president from September 1983 to March 1984 : " There was n't the possibility of democracy at ComputerLand . It was a one-man show . " Franchisees voice similar complaints . Says William Sadowski , who operates three + ComputerLand stores in suburban Chicago : " It 's because of Bill 's arrogance that all the problems came about . " <P> The task of solving ComputerLand 's woes now falls to Ed Faber , 52 , who served as president from 1976 until he retired in 1983 . The former Marine Corps captain was salmon fishing in Redding , Calif. , on Sept. 27 when Barbara Millard called to ask him to become the new chief executive . Within a day Faber had accepted , and last Monday he was in Chicago for a meeting of some 170 of the most disgruntled ComputerLand franchisees . <P> Moving quickly to address their complaints , Faber said that he will announce by the end of this month a plan to cut royalty fees , at least temporarily .
