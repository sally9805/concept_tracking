Mom always said it was the devil 's music . So why should n't the father of ' 50s rock ' n ' roll look like every white kid 's slumber-party dream of Satan ? A slim body , supple as sin . Wavy hair , drenched in Valvoline and just full enough to hide those telltale horns . A face already etched with pain and promises . Cocoa-color skin drawn taut over Jack Palance cheekbones . A smile that offered a great time on the way down . Chuck Berry might sing about School Days and Johnny B. Goode , but teens knew that his songs  --  from the opening guitar riff through the four-on-the-floor chorus to the florid finale  --  were siren calls to cut class and feel good . " You know my temperature risin ' , the jukebox blowin ' a fuse , / My heart beatin ' rhythm and my soul keep a-singin ' the blues. / Roll over Beethoven . Tell Tchaikovsky the news . " <P> The news quickly became history , and Chuck Berry made both . For he defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' n ' roll . His twangy blues guitar fused  --  indeed , electrified  --  rhythm and blues and country music , even as his popularity helped desegregate early rock . His lyrics rollicked with internal rhymes , subversive satire and a wit that bent and broadened the language . He demolished the pop-music wall that had long separated singer and songwriter ; now a man could perform his own compositions and do it with amazing sass . He could do wrong too , and here again Berry was a pioneer . Through decades of one-night stands , too much monkey business and a few command performances in stir , he fixed the image of the rock artist as outlaw . <P> If a statesman is a politician with a paunch , then an elder statesman of rock is an outlaw who has honorably served his time . Next week Chuck Berry turns 61 . But last week rock 's black prince saw his time come again . It began with a standing ovation at the New York Film Festival for the world premiere of Chuck Berry : Hail ! Hail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irreverent documentary with enough bop-till-you-drop golden hits to leave the springs broken in every Lincoln Center seat . On Tuesday Berry was back in his hometown of St. Louis to preside at the movie 's local opening . On Thursday he showed up in Los Angeles to have his legend buffed with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame . And all week he was happily promoting Chuck Berry : The Autobiography ( Harmony Books ; $17.95 ) , an unghosted , unfettered reminiscence about Berry 's family , his music and , for seekers of the salacious , the " naughty-naughties I would commit from time to time .
