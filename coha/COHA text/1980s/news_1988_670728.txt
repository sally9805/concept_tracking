Those who remember the raucous Oscar ' s Salt of the Sea on Third Avenue , a budget-priced , assembly-line fish house ( " Table 48 , Schwartz party ! " ) , will be astonished to see the decorous establishment that now occupies the premises . Called Le Laurier , it is a posh all-seafood restaurant of burnished teak , polished service and often precious food : this is about as different from Oscar ' s Salt of the Sea as Donald Trump ' s yacht is from the Circle Line. // Comparisons with the city ' s most celebrated seafood restaurant , Le Bernardin , are inevitable . For one , they are both designed by Philip George , who worked in a less grand space at Le Laurier . It has the same warm , corporate look with a coffered ceiling , inset lights , well-separated tables and soft leather banquettes . Noise is effectively muffled but at an esthetic price by uncomely beige fabric panels the size of a double bed . The most striking visual elements are the twin aquariums , filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining rooms The French-born chef , Patrick Pinon , who previously ran kitchens at La Recolte , the Garden City Hotel on Long Island , and Maxim ' s , clearly is capable of turning out splendid dishes to justify the $49 prix fixe ; at the moment , however , he seems to be straining , trying to dazzle customers with handiwork rather than delight them with clean flavors. // Examples of his letdowns are a warm lobster salad inscrutably dressed up with an acidic orange dressing and sliced artichokes , which enhance neither the texture nor the flavor . More jarring is a contrived entree that combines sauteed sea scallops , salty duck " ham " ( cured duck breast ) , wild mushrooms and garlic cloves . Among the successful starters are the scallop and shrimp terrine with a bright sauce of creme fraiche , Armagnac , minced truffles and tarragon ; a glistening tartar of tuna with an herb vinaigrette , and translucent slivers of raw fish ( ingredients change but often include tuna , salmon and snapper ) slickened with a lime-and-ginger sauce . The frothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lentils that add an interesting texture . The very proper service staff goes through the motions with discreet competence . Wines are well in tune with the menu , although a bit overpriced. // The chef ' s best efforts among entrees are those that carry the least baggage , such as the sauteed black bass strewn with chanterelles and stippled with green peppercorns ; red snapper over a bed of minced vegetables and a sherry-vinegar-sharpened herb sauce ; lobster meat tossed with plump morels in a potent lobster-stock sauce ; roasted halibut in a blanket of thinly sliced potatoes with a truffle sauce , and one of the best bouillabaisses in New York , replete with turbot , John Dory , rascasse ( a Mediterranean white fish ) and Dover sole. // The waters get murky when the kitchen experiments : a nicely cooked scrod in a robust garlic-powered sauce was crowned with a salty mound of stewed squid ; perfectly good grilled tuna with onion compote had an irrelevant tomato-and-celery coulis . And matelote of sole and sea bass - the French term generally refers to a lusty wine-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste , with the fish , mushrooms and scallions artfully arranged on a flat plate with too little sauce. // Desserts are the most consistently good offerings . Highlights include a trio of fruit tartlettes ( strawberry , raspberry and pineapple ) each with its own sorbet ; superb chocolate marquise cake with pistachio sauce , and pecan cornets filled with coffee ice cream and ringed by coffee sauce. // Le Laurier is clearly not trolling for the old eat-and-run Oscar ' s crowd ; it ' s going after a much more challenging catch . To have a sporting chance , though , the chef needs to steady his culinary rudder . Ecco ! // It didn ' t take long to figure out why Ecco ! , the Old World Italian restaurant on Chambers Street , is so popular with Wall Street traders . After a meal during which my dinner party was bullied , shouted at and patronized , a dinner guest who happened to be a stockbroker shook his head and said , " This is just like working on the floor of the stock exchange ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulgar service was not the worst of it : the food is undistinguished as well. // Ecco ! , with the same ownership as Campagnola on First Avenue near 73d Street , is not without some charms . The long rectangular room is rich with handsome old wood , an ornate turn-of-the-century bar , high-backed booths and period posters . The loud , animated scene befits the setting , but dealing with the staff is something else again. // The first evening , a captain wearing a bow tie and a look of exasperation suddenly appeared and , without even saying hello , started barking the daily specials . He had an air of impatience as we ordered , and when one guest hesitated to reconsider a dish , he grumbled , " Yeah , yeah , be right back , " then disappeared . When he returned , I asked for a pinot grigio , to which he barked , " Don ' t have it . You ' ll have the Gavi . " He then shouted the order at one of his minions , who promptly forgot about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited a half-hour ( wineless ) , combined cold , bready mussels ; good garlicky ribbons of marinated eggplant ; pallid tomato salad , and tasty shrimp with artichokes . The kitchen will not make half orders of pasta but will split full orders . Penne with a creamy tomato sauce cut with vodka was al dente and tasty although tepid ; spicy spaghetti with scallops , calamari , mussels and shrimp came in a good , peppery tomato sauce , and tortellini with peas and mushrooms in a cream sauce was tasty . Fusilli in a smoky tomato , onion and pancetta sauce , however , had tell-tale signs of having been reheated in mixed batches : some of the pasta was undercooked , the rest overcooked. // During all my visits , we waited much too long for entrees , but one night when it ran to more than 40 minutes , we asked one of the captains about it . He contended it was our fault because we had not ordered our entrees at the same time as our appetizers - which we had - and walked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in white wine was overcooked one evening ( better a week later ) , steak " alla Ecco ! " with garlic and rosemary was tough and bland , and veal with artichoke , a special , was forgettable . Better choices were the thick , tender veal chop ( light on seasoning but top quality meat ) and lamb chops with garlic cloves and rosemary . Chicken scarpariello ( with sausage , mushrooms , garlic and rosemary ) was an oleaginous mess : they didn ' t even bother to remove the brittle bay leaves. // For dessert , there are a good heavy-duty cheesecake , a flaky napoleon and a fudgelike chocolate cake that would sate most chocolate fiends. // It ' s hard to imagine why anyone , even combative Wall Streeters , would put up with such a boorish place , even if the food was superior . The next time I ' m hungry downtown , I ' ll invest elsewhere . <> <> Le Laurier <> <> * <> <> 1155 Third Avenue , near 67th Street , 879-1199 . <> Atmosphere : Formal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> Service : Proper and professional . <> Recommended dishes : Seafood terrine , tartar of tuna with an herb vinaigrette sauce , mussel soup with green lentils , sauteed black bass with chanterelles , red snapper with minced vegetables , lobster with morels , roasted halibut in a blanket of thinly sliced potatoes with a truffle sauce , trio of fruit tartlettes and sorbets , chocolate marquise cake , pecan cornets with coffee ice cream and coffee sauce . <> Price range : Dinner : $49 prix fixe . <> Credit cards : All major cards . <> Hours : Dinner : 6 to 11 P.M.
