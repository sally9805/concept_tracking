Like Gary Hart ( ( NATION , May 18 ) ) , I am an angry , defiant man . Having endured the shallow Reagan Administration , I do not believe the nation can afford another political debacle in 1988 . So I am angry that Hart would take the Democratic presidential nomination so lightly . I defy him to convince me that his behavior was not selfish and stupid . <P> Carl McFarland Jr . <P> Seattle <P> It is unbelievable that Senator Hart has been forced out of the race for the presidency of the U.S. because of a trifling indiscretion . Do Americans really insist that their leaders be models of sexual morality ? What the world expects of a U.S. President is a dedication to bringing about nuclear sanity . <P> Gulur S. Hiranyappa <P> Bangalore , India <P> One of the most fascinating aspects of the Hart affair is the reaction of other public figures . They downplay the importance of qualities like judgment and integrity and say we should focus on the issues . Well , we are not electing an issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line in this matter is that Americans do not want a President who cheats on his wife . <P> R. Wayne Porter <P> Russellville , Ariz . <P> King Solomon must have had Lee Hart in mind when he wrote , " Her price is far above rubies . " <P> Ben Morris <P> Kentwood , La . <P> In response to Betty Friedan 's comment that this is the last time a candidate will be able to treat women like bimbos , I say male politicians will treat females that way as long as women continue to behave like bimbos . <P> Roberta Breeden <P> Hinsdale , Ill . <P> What the Miami Herald did was despicable . Freedom of the press has got out of hand . Its power to intimidate and destroy is frightening . <P> Mary Hilbert <P> Freeland , Wash . <P> Hart 's political demise raises questions about the qualities a leader needs . A leader accepts responsibility for his errors and does not whine when the press exposes the truth . A leader does not avoid a fight if he believes he is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that voters / will judge him by his deeds . Did the media cause Hart 's downfall ? No , because he never was a leader . <P> Jerry Holderman <P> Irvine , Calif.
