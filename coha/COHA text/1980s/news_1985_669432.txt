If ' ' nuffin else , ' ' as Twain ' s character Jim would say , the tale set off a peck of trouble when it hit the street 100 years ago. // Twain ' s admonition to the contrary , famous folks from Louisa May Alcott to Ernest Hemingway stepped forward to trumpet Huck ' s literary virtues and moral failings. // Twain , to his credit , predicted ' ' The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn ' ' would be a ' ' handsome success ' ' because of the ruckus . Readers , it seemed , ' ' laid low to see what wuz gwyne to come of it. ' ' // ' ' All modern American literature comes from onebook by Mark Twain , called ' Huckleberry Finn , ' ' ' wrote Hemingway . ' ' If Mr. ( Samuel ) Clemens ( Mark Twain ) can not think of something better to tell our pure-minded lads and lasses , he ' d best stop writing for them , ' ' wrote Alcott. // // Well , what has come of Huckleberry Finn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction , ' ' according to T. S. Eliot - is continued controversy . Since its initial United States publication in February 1885 , this acknowledged masterpiece by one of America ' s best writers and humorists has become an American classic as well as a literary lightning rod for moral critics . While initial objections cited the novel ' s violence and ethical laxity - ' ' veriest trash , ' ' wrote the Concord ( Mass . ) Public Library when it banned the book shortly after publication - modern critics have called the book racist , particularly Twain ' s repetitive use of the appellative ' ' nigger. ' ' // Now in the centennial year of the novel ' s publication - as well as the sesquicentennial celebration of Twain ' s birth in 1835 and the 75th anniversary of his passing - the debate continues . It is a literary argument suddenly revived by the recent disclosure of a letter written by Twain offering financial assistance to one of the first black students at Yale University . Written in the same year that ' ' Huck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the first real evidence that Twain vigorously opposed racism. // ' ' I do not believe I would very cheerfully help a white student who would ask benevolence of a stranger , ' ' wrote Twain to the dean of the law school , regarding black student Warner T. McGuinn , ' ' but I do not feel so bad about the other color . We have ground the manhood out of them , &; the shame is ours , not theirs ; &; we should pay for it. ' ' // The Yale scholar who authenticated the letter , Shelley Fisher Fishkin , says : ' ' Twain ' s brutally succinct comment on racism in the letter is a rare nonironic statement of the personal anguish Twain felt regarding the destructive legacy of slavery. ' ' // But other observers are not so sanguine . ' ' The letter is simply an attempt by Yale University and Twain to soothe their racist consciences , ' ' says John Wallace , a member of the Chicago Board of Education and one of the most outspoken critics of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the amount of damage done by the novel to black children , it ' s a drop in the bucket. ' ' // Already this latest disclosure is becoming a flash point in the longstanding debate begun by some educators and civil rights leaders during the 1960s that despite Twain ' s use of irony , ' ' Huckleberry Finn ' ' is objectionably racist and should be removed from mandatory reading lists and school libraries . While few libraries actually ban the book today , several school boards consider it offensive to blacks and object to its use in classrooms. // According to the American Library Association ( ALA ) , at least a dozen incidents of censorship involving ' ' Huckleberry Finn ' ' have been reported within the past five years alone . The two most recent attempts occurred in Chicago . In one instance , a local alderman and parents attempted to remove the novel from a public school ' s reading list . In the other , some civil rights leaders and educators threatened to picket a recent stage adaptation of the novel at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , and it still has the power to raise emotions , ' ' says Judith Krug , director of the ALA ' s Office for Intellectual Freedom , which monitors book censorship around the country. // Hailed as the first American novel written in natural speech - Twain ' s mastery of several Midwestern dialects including ' ' Missouri Negro dialect ' ' is legendary - ' ' Huckleberry Finn ' ' facilely reads as a picaresque tale of a Missouri teen-ager and a runaway slave who escape all attempts at ' ' sivilizing ' ' and raft down the Mississippi River . But unlike Twain ' s earlier children ' s story , ' ' The Adventures of Tom Sawyer , ' ' ' ' Huckleberry Finn ' ' is largely considered to be a sophisticated satirical censure of a nation ' s racial policies . Scholars point to Twain ' s unique literary device - portraying a racist society through the eyes of a boy too innocent to challenge the system. // ' ' Huck and Jim really stand as a reproach to a dominant society , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twain . ' ' They are two very truthful people that may offend people even today . ' ' Other observers , however , insist that Twain ' s use of irony is too subtle and that his characterization of Jim , the runaway slave , is a distorted portrait of American blacks. // ' ' Huck Finn is one of the most grotesque examples of racism ever written , ' ' says Mr. Wallace . ' ' It is not funny and not ironic , if a majority of the population believes it. ' ' // Calling the book ' ' adult entertainment , ' ' Wallace has lobbied to remove it from use in several public schools . ' ' By injecting the word ' nigger ' into the classroom , you induce a catastrophic reaction in children , ' ' he says . As an alternative , Wallace , a former elementary school administrator , has published his own version of the work , ' ' The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , Adapted , ' ' in which ' ' objectionable ' ' terms have been deleted or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist that the novel is not racist , that Twain ' s language is historically accurate , and that Jim is not only the most noble character of the book but also the first black hero in American fiction . Reviewing the Goodman Theatre production in the Chicago Defender ( the oldest and largest black publication in Chicago ) , one critic wrote : ' ' I think that it is time that as African-Americans , we must mature . ' ' Meshach Taylor , the black actor who played Jim in the Goodman production , called the novel ' ' the best indictment against racism in the US that I had ever read. ' ' // ' ' The novel is an attack on racism , not a racist tract , ' ' says Stewart Gordon , director and adapter of the Goodman production . ' ' Everything is from the perspective of a teen-age kid . The battle is between ( Huck ' s ) good heart and a deformed society . ' ' Mr. Gordon says the book has traditionally received a ' ' bad rap ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s story. // ' ' Twain started ' Huckleberry Finn ' as another boys ' book , ' ' says Twain biographer Kaplan . ' ' But he soon realized the darker side of his story . The book is actually a real education of conscience ' ' - for the author as well his protagonist. // Twain ' s early brushes with prejudice and censorship are well known - early in his career Twain was unable to get published some newspaper articles about anti-Chinese racism in San Francisco . But Kaplan maintains that one can not ' ' make Twain out as a crusader against racism . ' ' Using William Dean Howells ' s description of Twain as a ' ' desouthern-ized ' ' Southerner , Kaplan says that ' ' in many ways , Twain ' s own education parallels that of Huck Finn ' s . Both learn that everything is not as it seems. ' ' // While Twain overcame many of his own racial prejudices acquired in his Southern boyhood , Kaplan says he remained a ' ' deeply conflicted man ' ' who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as racism and the Industrial Revolution. // Kaplan cautions against any ' ' cultural lollypopping ' ' of Twain during this centennial year . Celebratory events planned around the country include a summer-long festival in Twain ' s home town of Hannibal , Mo. , a five-month exhibit at the National Geographic Society , a three-day conference at the University of Missouri , and the issuing of two commemorative editions of ' ' Huck Finn ' ' by the University of California Press. // ' ' For a long time we took Twain at his word that he was simply a funny man , a genial humorist , ' ' says Kaplan . ' ' But really his greatness and his durability came from his clear vision of things , even his anger. ' ' // //
