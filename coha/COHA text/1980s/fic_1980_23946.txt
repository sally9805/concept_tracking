GOOD MORNING TO YOU , LIEUTENANT A short story by Larry Heinemann W E CAN STAND at the crest of the town 's one good hill , James , you and I , and pause to get quiet and comfortable and still , and listen to the night sounds . At this late hour of the night the tranquil murmuring hum of the river , cascading over the rock-and-cement spillway under the bridge , yonder , is almost the only sound to be heard . That constant rush of water is the hush that has lulled many a strapping newborn infant to sleep in its time . That hush is the last sobering sound heard suddenly , abruptly , in many a death-bed room , as clean and even and smooth as the curl in the neck of a glass cider jug . But that is not the only night sound to be heard in that town . James . We can sit on the thick slate curb , under the parkway walnut trees , and hear the squeak of wicker chairs ; the tumble of ice melting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the whisper of bedroom conversation that is all hisses , and the snapping and popping of buttons ; women flapping and fluttering their light , summery dress fronts like bellows ; the shrill squeal of children racing through swirling clouds of fireflies with quart canning jars , a game better than tag ; the sudden crackle and crunch of someone rumpling a beer can , then a clatter of cans ; someone spitting on dry pavement ; the snick snick snick of the tails of a loose pack of town dogs on the schoolyard blacktop . Then the sound that all but stops the others , even the dogs  --  the tap , step-tap , tap , step-tap of that gimpy kid wounded in the war , that guy Paco , who washes dishes by hand at the Texas Lunch , that greasy spoon across the way from the Greyhound depot . All those night sounds bristle , brushing back and forth under the trees , and everyone who 's sitting back , listening , hears . And you and I hear , do n't we , James  --  the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the giggles , the clear click of the cast-brass tip of Paco 's cane . And that girl , with the rooms across the hall from the head of the stairs at the transient hotel where Paco lives , listens too . ( The girl , James  --  her name Cathy  --  small-breasted and bony-armed , built small like a smooth-faced , tallish boy , and whenever Paco sees her she is wearing a man 's dress shirt with the cuffs rolled a time or two to the middle of her forearms , the shirttails loose at her thighs , a collar as stiff as a military uniform tunic . ) Nearly every night the girl will sit on the broad , dusty sill of the alley window over the head of her bed with her small , clean feet drawn up under her , and lean her cheek against the filthy screen . She listens to the river the way a meditative person will gaze into a bonfire , but she does n't pay it so much as a never-you-mind. ; does n't give it so much as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perks her ears with a deliberate and uncanny intentness , listening ever so keenly for the sharp click of Paco 's black hickory cane on the asphalt , and the sure and steady slight off-rhythm of his walk  --  tap , step-tap , tap , step-tap . Her moist sparkling eyes will dart this way and that around the room , and she 'll glance out the window , rubbing the cool , smooth , nut-brown skin of her knee ( her whole body as brown as toast , James ) with the breezy heat of the tin-and-tar back-porch roof rising in her face , and she 'll try to count the courses of smoothed herringbone brick in the alley below . She will absentmindedly stare at her own fingers as she strums a limp gold anklet with manicured fingernails . In her mind she will see Paco 's hands , bleached-white and water-wrinkled , the sweat-soaked shirt clinging to the hard flat of his stomach : will see that glazed-over , glossy look in his eyes , which in most people is simply work weariness . E VERY NIGHT when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change to the mellow , hollow thump of the stoop , she will uncurl herself and crawl crab-like across her bed . She will primp on the move and brush herself down , using her fingers for a whisk , smoothing down that lime-or peach- or cocoa-colored dress shirt I opened a couple of buttons at the neck ) , and strike a pose leaning against the warm wood of her door . Sometimes she will hold the door open just so far with her head leaned into the hall as though she 's dripping wet and does n't want to drip on the hallway rug , but the front of that shirt will be nearly all unbuttoned , and there 's enough light shining down her front to be teasing , enticing . And sometimes she will put just her head in the light , with her body to one side , and she 'll have a glittering gleam in her eye as though she does n't have a stitch on . And you 've got to know , James , that some nights she does n't , but those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because being buck naked when she smiles that smirk down at Paco makes her feel so goosey and juicy and naughty , and sometimes she ca n't help but giggle . She will wait for Paco to come in the front , and stop at the bottom of the stairway and stand stoop-shouldered , leaning so heavily on that goddamned cane some nights it will bow . She will wait for him to raise his eyes and look up through the railing rungs , and see her in the dim amber light of the hallway ( the light shining on the smooth , browned skin of her legs and face , looking like dry oval slivers of yellowed , antique ivory ) . She will stir slightly , waiting for that look in his eyes that is unmistakable in a man who has notbeen with a woman for a long time . And Paco will nod , almost imperceptibly , and then will begin the race , the struggle to get to the top of the stairs before she slips back into her room and closes the door . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he can get so much as the tip of his cane in the door before she shuts it , he may come in . ( " You can fuck me , Sugar . " ) And Paco has struggled up those stairs many a night , ass-whipped tired , his legs tingling and throbbing , wobbly even , his feet sore and sweat-soaked , and that goddamned lye-soap rash on his arms as red as rope burns . Washing dishes by hand ai n't no pleasure and it ai n't no joke , James . But tonight , getting in Cathy 's doorway does n't happen . No , no . Tonight he comes up the street and into the hotel , hits the stairs , and just keeps coming . Tonight Paco has been sitting on the damp hard clay of the riverbank down by the spillway , listening to the skinny-dippers horsing around in the sand-bottomed shallows , downriver from the railroad trestle , drinking beers with Jesse ( that lanky , rangy cat with the brown ponytail ) half the night , waiting for the air to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . He limps up the hallway to the left with his skeleton key in one hand and his black hickory cane in the other , works the door open , steps in , and closes it behind him with a slow and heavy click ( as firm and final a sound as we are likely to hear in that hotel . James ) . The hall light vanishes from the room except for a flat , slender sliver of light under the door not any bigger than a piece of oak lath . Paco squeezes his head against the warm and sticky door , squeezing his eyes shut from the pure relief of being home , taking a bit of a breather . Paco 's got a still and stuffy , smothering little room , with a crumbling 8 x 10 lino . leum sheet , a ragged mahogany dresser with the veneer shredding to splinters , and a coffee-colored bedstead with a brown bedspread . There is a scum of dust in all the corners , and fuzzy , flowered wallpaper you would swear was flocked if you brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his darkened room , peeling off his T-shirt , unbuckling his belt and unzipping his fly , scooting his pants down , skivvies and all . Then he flops back on his creaking bed , the way drunks do . His head and arms Loll this way and that , and his legs hang over the edge of the bed with the balls of his feet brushing the floor . He sets his hands wide on the raspy , grayish sheets , stares hard at the curling chips of paint above his head . then takes a good long breath , and with a sudden , sharp exhalation , lifts his legs onto the bed . And it 's god-awful painful , James . Sometimes the pain shoots straight up his legs and thighs ( he can hear the pins grinding against the bone ) to his back and arms and fingers , up to his eyes ( oh , the grimacing squint wrinkles he will have ) . The very tips of his fingers tingle as though someone has pricked them . He takes a long moment to settle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small of his back just so among the lumps . The air is hot and heavy around him , and the sheets are as itchy and scratchy as snapping-dry flannel . ( Everything has been warm and sticky and uncomfortable all day , every day , and all the night through , for weeks now . Bread wo n't rise right . Beer foam looks pale and greasy and slippery . Your clothes bunch thickly at the crotch and cling to your back and down under your arms , for instance , and folks are awkward and ill-tempered most of the time. ) w E CAN TAKE a pause now , and lean down over Paco 's thighs and knees and calves . James , you and I. even in this little light of his room ( there is a slice of moon , the I0-watt back-porch light . and the glow of the yellow hall light reflected into the room under the door ; this faint , burdensomely warm and oppressive light that gives his room a welcome and intimate air nonetheless , as still and smothering a place as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights , unrelieved by comfort ) , if we lean down . I say , we could see the many razor-sharp , razor-thin surgical scars , the bone-fragment scars ( going every which way ) the size of pine-stump splinters , the puckered burn scars ( from cooked-off ammunition ) , looking as though he 'd been sprayed with a shovelful of glowing cinders , the deadened , discolored ring of skin at the meatiest part of his thigh where the Bravo Company medic wound the twisted tourniquet , using Paco 's own bandanna , though the time for a tourniquet had long since passed . The sallow , thin-faced medic slapped the crook of Paco 's elbow to get a vein , and Paco and half the company could hear him grumble , " Come on , you dumbshit grunt motherfucker , give me a goddamned vein , " and Paco 's arm stung like a son of a bitch , and the medic 's dog tags jangled in Paco 's face ( the same as his old man would rattle the buckle end of his belt in Paco 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we looked at Pace 's arm we could see the scar of the gouge at the inside of his forearm the size of a pencil stub where the catheter ripped loose when those geekfucking , shit-for-brains Bravo Company litter-bearers dropped Paco down a rain-slick footpath , litter and all . ( " You goddamned bullshit fucking Bravo Company Jesus Christ I hope you motherfuckers all die shit ! " ) We could lean down and take a good hard look , and see all that , James , even in this little light . We could back away , now that we know what we 're looking at , and those scars will seem to wriggle and curl , snapping languidly this way and that , I swear , the same as grubs and night crawlers when you prick them with the barb of a bait hook . It is only an illusion , James , a sly trick of the eye . But that is the way many a frightful thing in this world comes alive in the dimmest , whitest moonlight , the lowest lamplight . He lies on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get as comfortable as the muggy air and sweaty-filthy sheets and teasing , tickling ache will allow , but out his window , just the other side of her window , kitty-corner to his , he hears the girl , Cathy , and she 's honey-fucking the everlasting daylights out of some guy ( Marty-boy , she calls him ) . There 's no mistaking that sound , the bed squeaking effortlessly and meekly . t Fucking the girl is something Paco has dreamed over and over , James , sprawled spraddle-legged spread-eagle on his creaking , coffee-colored bedstead bed with the filthy brown bedspread , with this flaccid cock flopped to one side of his aching thighs  --  oh , how his legs would ache on those nights  --  his pubic hair fluffy and prickly , almost crackling in the heat , like dry grass . ) Paco does n't have to strain any to hear , because his bed is shoved alongside the wall under the window . He can slide his hand and arm out the window  --  over the dust and blistered nicotine streaks and coffee-cup rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of her hair . Cathy sighs slowly and calmly and soothingly involuntary and contented , Paco thinks to himself  --  brimful of peace and pleasure . Now , Cathy hai heard Paco fiddle with his key in the lock , heard him fumbling around in his dingy little room , smelled the very beer on his breath . ( She thinks his room is depressing  --  faded wallpaper , no telling what the motif was , and that tacky , shabby linoleum . And he 's a dingy , dreary , smelly , shabby , shabby little man . ) And now , with each slippery thrust , she stretches her thin little neck and exhales audibly toward the window . She pulls on Marty-boy 's pale , shuddering hips , clawlike , with sedately manicured nails , and sways from side to side as though she were cooing and cuddling an infant ( with her thin , pinkish lip between her teeth and a slap-happy 64 grin on her face , as though to say , I get a nice little kick from teasing that gimp , but fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paco sweats up a storm trying to wish himself sober , trying to wish himself up and out of his bed and straight to the foot of her bed . He wishes Marty-boy some skinny primary-education major from a teachers ' college just outside of town 1 to hell and gone . He lies on his back , smelling the starched linen and eau de cologne , the pungent tin-and-tar porch roof and the rank sweetness of their sweat . He stares up at the darkened ceiling and the curled chips of paint that hang down as thick as a shedding winter shag . Then suddenly , abruptly , he remembers Pfc . Randy Gallagher 's Bangkok R and R tattoo of a red and black dragon that covered the inside of his forearm from his wrist to his elbow ( that tattoo a goddamned work of art , everyone said , a regular fucking masterpiece ) . p ACO SEES THAT TATTOO , then suddenly , abruptly , remembers the rape of the VC girl , and the dreams he has had of the rape . He winces and squirms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not choose but to remember . Gallagher 's got this girl by the hair . She is n't just any girl , you understand  --  not some dirt farmer 's wife or one of those god-awful ugly camp-following whores ; she is n't some poor son of a bitch 's tagalong sister pestering people with her whining , and she is n't some rear-rank slick-sleeve private ( who does n't know dismounted , close-order drill from shit and Shinola ) who pushes a pencil or wraps field bandages and smiles big and pretty when the Swedish photographers shoot through on the grand tour . No , James , she is as hard a hardcore VC as they come ( by the look of the miles on her face ) . She had ambushed the First Platoon 's night Listening Post just shy of first light , shot two of them dead , and the company was hunkered down , wet and sullen , waiting for a medivac helicopter  --  dust-off we called it  --  and a couple of body bags . And Gallagher was nibbling from a bar of Hershey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily chlorinated canteen water , watching her squatting on her haunches , wolfing down a C-ration can of ham and eggs some fucking new guy had given her  --  she wolfed it down with the plastic spoon and her thumb  --  and finally Gallagher had had enough . He muttered something about only one way to cool out gooks , and the next thing you know , James , he had her by the hair and was hauling her this way and that the spit bubbles at thecorners of his mouth slurring his words ) through the company to his brick-and-stucco hooch off to one side of the clearing that 's roofless and fucked-up with mortar hits up one side and down the other . Paco sees wiseacre ( " fuck-you-up-boy " ) Gallagher haul that girl through the night laager by the hair of her head ; sees this dude and that dude peel off from their night positions and follow across the hard , bare clay , smacking their lips to a fare-thee-well  --  there 's a bunch of dudes in that company want a piece of that gook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps a bedroom . The whole time the girl looks at that red and black tattoo out of the corners of her eyes like a fretted , hysterical dog . She can only see the slick-sweated tail curled and twisted and twined this way and that around itself , and the stumpy , lizardlike legs the long , reddish tongue curls around the snout and head and long curving neck and forelegs , but she can not see that much because of the way Gallagher has her by the hair ) . ( Take your hand , James , and reach around to the top of your head , grab as much hair as you can in one hand and yank , then press that arm tight against the side of your head and look over at your arm out of the corners of your eyes . That 's as much of Gallagher 's arm as the woman sees . ) The hooch is claustrophobic with thick walls and small rooms , and smells like an old wet dog . Gallagher and the others smell sourly of issue mosquito repellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rot . The woman smells of jungle funk and cordite  --  gunpowder , James  --  and piss . If the zip had been a man we would not have bothered with the motherfucker , you understand that , do n't you , James ? Gallagher , or whoever , would have grabbed that son of a bitch by his whole head of hair  --  that zip staring at the twined and twisted and curlicued red and black tail of that Bangkok R and R tattoo , knowing it would be the last thing he 's likely to get a good clean look at in this life . Gallagher would have dragged him over to that hooch , jerking him clean off his feet every other step , snatching his head this way and that for good measure  --  long , filthy black hairs coming loose in his sweaty hand  --  Gallagher grumbling through his teeth about the one and only fucking way to put the chill on gooks . We would take him straight around to the side , hold him straight-backed against the beat-to-hell brick-and-stucco wall  --  his toes wiggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes that big and his poor little asshole squeezed tighter than a four-inch wad 66 of double sawbucks . We would pound on that poor cocksucker till his face was ragged , till our arms were tired . " Anybody else want a poke at ' im ? Goin ' once . Twice . Three fucker ' times . " Then someone would hold him while Jonesy pulls out his pearl-handled straight razor just as slow and catlike and quiet as a barber commencing to trim around your ears , James . Jonesy would flick that sucker open with a flashy snap , showing that puffyeyed , bloody faced zip four inches of the goddamnedest Swedish steel he 's likely to come across , and then just as slow and calm and cool as you would halve a melon , James , Jonesy would slit that zip 's throat from nine to three . He would n't be cutting him the way he snipped ears ; would n't cut him the way he whittled booby-trap tripwire stakes for Paco ; no , he 'd cut him with a slow sweep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those long-handled scythes ; that barebacked , bare-armed motion with the sweat popping on their arms and the yellow wheat laid back in thick armfuls . Beautiful and horrible . The razor cut would bleed horrible abundance , the zip 's life gushing from his neck with him watching it , not hardly believing  --  his face wax-white  --  bleeding in terrific spurts . It would be as though he 'd been garroted , good and proper hard , only the razor cut would hiss and bubble and gurgle the way a garroting simply can not . You 've got to understand , James , that if the zip had been a man we would have punched on him , then killed him right then and there , and left him for dead . So Gallagher is hauling the woman off by the hair and she 's looking just as hard as hard can be at that red and black dragon tattoo . And she 's naked from the waist up , but nothing much to look at so no one is much looking at her , and she 's flailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swinging her legs , trying to kick him in the balls , but Gallagher 's doing a pretty good job of blocking her punches and holding her back ( was a wrestler , Gallagher was ) . She 's screaming in Viet and no one can understand , but can figure out pretty well , " Pig . You pig . GI beau-coup number-ten goddamn shit-eating fucking pig . I spit on you . " Gallagher 's dodging and bobbing and weaving , and chuckling , saying , " Sure , Sweet Pea , sure . " Gallagher pulls her ? arms flailing , legs kicking , screaming that hysterical bullshit at the top of her lungs . And everybody in the whole ballpark knows they are n't going in there to argue who could throw the blandest brush-back pitch  --  Lyle Walsh or Dub Paterson . Even Lieut . John Ridley Stennett ( Dartmouth , 1967 ) knows for a refreshing fucking change . Good morning to you , Lieutenant ! HEY TAKE HER right into the side room , and there is n't much of a roof , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ass end of some bullshit furniture littered around . You walk on the stone parquet floor of that mortared hooch , James , and the crumbs of red roofing tile and whatnot crunch underfoot , like picture-window glass will grind and snap and squeak underfoot . That hooch is a ruin , James , a regular stone riot of ruin . Gallagher and the girl and Jonesy and Paco and the others stand in the brightening overcast ( more like bright , hazy glare ) that makes you squint involuntarily , as though you 're reading fine print . Jonesy takes a long stretch of black comma wire and whips a handful of it into the open air . It loops high over the ridge pole and comes down , smacking Paco in the leg . Gallagher and Paco hold the girl down firmly while Jonesy ties her wrists together behind her back , then hauls on that wire the same as if he were hoisting the morning colors , just as crisp and snappy as The Book says . Well , James , she 's got to bend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over this raw plank table about the size of a kitchen table . The girl is scared shitless , James , and shuddering , glossy and greasy with sweat , and chilly , and she 's half tempted to ask them as one human being to another not to rape her , not to kill her , but she does n't speak English . There 's considerable jostling and arm-punching and jawing back and forth , everyone forming a rough line , so just for that moment Paco gets to stand there and take a good long look . A peasant girl , not more than fourteen , say , or sixteen . And by the look of her back she has worked , hard , every day of her life . She 's not beefy , though . None of the Viets are big . Is n't their nature most likely , but then sharecropping does n't tend to turn out strapping , hale and hardy offspring . Ask anyone who knows shit from shit and Shinola about farming and he will tell you that sharecropping is a long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dumbest dumbshit on the face of this earth , who knows just enough to follow a horse around with a coal shovel , knows that sharecropping sucks ; knows you ca n't spend your time leaning on your hoe handle or the porch pillar and make a living sharing your crop with yourself , much less the Man . Who knows , maybe Viets enjoy being thin and frail , gaunt and rickety , rheumy and toothless . May be . They get along well enough on forty-and-found  --  what they can grow and what they can find and it 's a long , hard row to hoe , James . Viet sharecroppers eat rice and greens and fishheads , and such as that  --  whatever they can catch ; whatever they can lay their bare hands on . Jonesy steps up behind the woman , takes out his pearl-handled straight razor with a magician 's flourish  --  acting real gaudy and showy the way he could  --  and slits her flimsy black pants from the cuffs to the waistband just the same as you 'd zip a parka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoists her up another notch or two for good measure until her shoulders turn white ( clear on the other side of the laager Lieutenant Stennett hears the comma wire squeak ) . Gallagher steps up behind her , between her feet , unbuttons his fly , and eases his cock out . He leans on her hard , James , rubbing himself up a hard-on , and slips it to her . Then he commences to fuck her , hard , with his big meaty hand pressed into the middle of her back . Gallagher and Jonesy start to grin and want to laugh , and a couple of dudes do laugh , because no one in the company has had any pussy for a month of Sundays I except for Lieutenant Stennett , but he has n't been in this man 's army a month of Sundays ) . And when Gallagher finishes , Jonesy fucks her , and when Jonesy ' is done half the fucking company is standing in line and commences to fuck her ragged . The girl bites the inside of her cheek to bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low and narrow doorway , drinking warm and bitterly sour canteen water and warm beers ( they 've been saving ) , smoking cigars and jays , watching one another while they grind the girl into the rubble . Her eyes get bigger than a deer 's , and the chunks and slivers of tile and such get ground into her scalp and face , her breasts and stomach , and Jesus-fucking-Christ she 's got her nostrils flared and her teeth clenched and her eyes are squinted and tearing from the sheer humiliating grinding pain of it . ( Paco can remember feeling her whole body pucker down ; can feel her bowels , right here and now , squeezing as tight as if you were wringing out a rag ; can see that huge red mark in the middle of her back ; can hear her involuntarily snorting and spitting : can see the broad smudge of blood on the table as clear as day ; can hear all those dudes walking on all that rubble . ) There 's dudes still ambling over to the end of the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out coaching , taking their turn , hanging around the side of the building , after ? some getting back in line again and again . And clean across the clearing  --  way the hell on the other side of the laager ; way the fuck out in left field on the other side of the moon ? Lieutenant Stennett squats on his steel pot with his knees up and his back to the doings in that hooch , making himself a canteen cup of coffee . The dudes at the quiet end of the line hear the feathery hiss of the thumb-sized chunk of C-4 plastic explosive , and the clank of the green bamboo twig he stirs it with , but do n't you know , James , they do n't pay it so much as a never-you-mind . The lieutenant hears the grinding , raucous laughter behind him ; hears that raw-wood table squeak and creak , creeping across the floor , shoved at and shoved at the way you might pound at the edge of a kitchen table with the heels of your hand . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder and see that line formed and that bit of commo wire looped over the ridge pole . He knows what 's what in that hooch all right , all right  --  he may be a fool , James , but he ai n't a stone fool . He works his shoulders , trying to work that damp , rawboned and rainy sweaty feeling of sleep out of his shoulders . He keeps his back bent and his head slumped , tending his hissing little C-4 fire , stirring the caked and lumpy thousandyear-old C-ration instant coffee furiously with a knotted bamboo stick until you would think he was going to wear a hole in it , if you did n't know any better . Well , good morning to you , Lieutenant ! Is the coffee fried ? A ND WHEN EVERYONE has had as many turns as he wants ( Paco fascinated by the huge red welt in the middle of her back ) , as many turns as he can stand , Gallagher takes the girl out behind that bullshit brick-and-stucco hooch , yanking her this way and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we notice long black hairs on the back of his arm ) . He 's holding her the way you 'd grab some shrimpy little fucker by the throat  --  mother-fuck-you-up street-mean and businesslike  --  and he slams her against the wall and hoists her up until her gnarled toes barely touch the ground . But the woman does n't much fucking care , James . She 's bloody up one side and down the other , as though someone had taken a handful of splinters and whatnot and smeared and ground them into her scalp and face and chest , and such as that . There 's spit and snot and blood and drool all over her , and she 's pissed herself . Her eyes have that dead stare to them , and she does n't seem to know what 's happening anymore . Gallagher slips his .357 Magnum out of its holster and touches her deftly just under the breastbone and says , " Who 's it ? Who 's it ? " just like tag , in a clear resonant voice , and jerks her once and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then he lays the muzzle to her forehead , between her eyebrows . He holds her up by the hair and works his fingers on the pistol grip , not to fuck with her more , but simply to get the best grip ( a .357 is n't a metal-shop , hand-crank zip gun , James ) . The girl 's glaring eyes watch the red and black tattoo of the dragon , and she 's near enough to his band to purse her lips and kiss the knuckles . And then in the middle of all this  --  dudes grabassing and fooling around  --  he squeezes off the round . Boom . The pistol bucks , and Gallagher 's whole body shimmers . Some of the fucking new guys flinch , and Lieutenant Stennett positively jerks his arms and splashes himself with scalding water . Smoke rises from the pistol and his hand in a cloud ; in wisps . If you had been listening close , you would have heard the ring of metal on metal , the same way you can hear a 105 howitzer ring with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you whacked a thirty-foot I-beam with a ten-pound ball peen  --  a sound you feel in every bone in your body from the marrow out . With her head so close against the hooch we hear the simultaneous shot and clack and clatter of bone chips against the brick and stucco . The slug and the hard , splintered chips of brick ricochet and strike her in the meatiest part of her back , between the shoulder blades . She is dead in that instant I and I mean stone dead , James ) , and just that quick there is blood all over everything and everyone , and splinters of bone and brick stuck in our clothes and the bare skin of our arms and chests and faces . The girl 's body lies in its own abundant blood ; her hands and fingers flutter the same as a dog 's when it dreams . Paco remembers the spray of blood and brick and bone chips on Gallagher and Jonesy , and everyone , as thick as freckles , and it sparkles . He remembers that quick tingling itch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen . He remembers the brown blood stains down the front of his trousers for days afterward . He remembers Gallagher turning to us , and us making a path when he walked away , and hearing him say loud as if we were in an auditorium ( the timbre and resonance of his voice reverberating superbly ) , " That 's how you cool out gooks . " Most of us shake out of our reverie and walk away , too , but some of us stay , staring down at the bloody thighs , the filthy bottoms of her feet , the slumped head , and her flat , mannish face  --  that is both counting coup , ina way , and dumb , dull , and curious fascination . The whole expression of her face is drawn to the dry , drooping lips . We look at her and at ourselves , drawing breath again and again , knowing that this is a moment of evil , that we will never live the same . ( It has even begun to dawn on Lieutenant Stennett , the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other side of the laager with his back as round and smooth as a black beach pebble , minding his p 's and q 's like there was no tomorrow , still stirring his coffee . ) Soon enough we hear the thack thack thack , thomp thomp thomp , whap whap whap of the Huey dust-off chopper . It circles once around the laager , then comes upwind and lands . One by one we back away from the girl and the hooch , and go help load the body bags . By that time the girl -- whatever her name was ? is still . When the dust-off is loaded , it rises and is gone . Lieutenant Stennett gets the word to hit the road . We saddle our rucksacks and turn away from that hooch and leave that place , and never go back . Perhaps the girl 's body was found later , and buried , but we would never know . Paco sprawls spread-eagle in his bed in his one-room room , itchy hot and stinking drunk , thinking about Gallagher 's tattoo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dust-off medics gave us . Cathy and Marty-boy are still fucking up a storm an arm 's reach away , Cathy sighing contentedly , and Paco 's cock is iron hard , and his groin aches . His knees and scars , and such , ache and throb . He knows he 's not going to get any sleep this night ( it is n't the first and it wo n't be the last , but not because of the heat I. And he 's lying on his bed listening to Cathy finish ( " Oh , Marty-boy , that was just super ! " ) , and he can not help his hard-on .
