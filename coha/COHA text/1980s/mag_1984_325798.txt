A panel shoots down Star Wars <P> A year after President Ronald Reagan unveiled his proposal for stationing a U.S. missile defense system in space , the basic feasibility of the idea continues to generate superheated controversy . It has been soundly endorsed by two Pentagon scientific commissions , which contend that advances in laser and other directed-energy technology make zapping enemy missiles from space a viable defense strategy . Last week the results of an inquiry into the notion were announced by a nine-man study group of the Union of Concerned Scientists , an organization based in Cambridge , Mass. , that supports a nuclear freeze and has been critical of the nuclear-power industry . The group 's unsurprising verdict : the Star Wars space defense system envisioned by Reagan is technologically " unattainable . " <P> Achieving the degree of effectiveness that would provide a shield for the entire U.S. population , the panel said , depends on the ability to intercept Soviet missiles just after they have been launched , when their heat-emitting rocket engines provide a distinctive radar clue . No such " signature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detection is further complicated after the booster phase , when the rocket fires multiple reentry vehicles , including some decoys . Even if only 5% of Soviet missiles penetrated the space shield , the group argued , as many as 60 million Americans would die . <P> The Soviets already have several means of foiling attempts at booster-stage interception . For example , the U.C.S. panel said , the Soviets could increase the power of their weapons ' rocket boosters , cutting their burn time from a present average of 5 min. to as little as 40 sec . " We know very well how to defeat these defensive systems , " says Henry Kendall , an M.I.T. physics professor and U.C.S. chairman . " We do n't know how to build them . " Further work on the project , the U.C.S. scientists contend , will destabilize the strategic balance , which depends on both sides being equally vulnerable to attack . In addition , it would almost certainly force the U.S. to abrogate the twelve-year-old antiballistic missile treaty with the Soviets , dealing a blow to nuclear-arms-control efforts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfazed by the union 's scathing report . Retired Army Lieut . General Daniel Graham called it the product of " those Charles River boys who say it ca n't be done . " The Administration is continuing to press for an initial funding of $1.8 billion in next year 's defense budget , currently before Congress . Over the next five years , it wants the U.S. to spend a total of $26 billion on the project .
