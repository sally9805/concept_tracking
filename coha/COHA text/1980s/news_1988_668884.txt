Atty . Gen. Edwin Meese , a prominent federal judge , a well-connected Washington lawyer and a former attorney general are key figures in an extraordinary bankruptcy case filled with charges of conspiracy , political manipulation and conflict of interest . At the center of this growing legal storm is what would have appeared to be a fairly routine contract dispute between a little-known developer of computer programs and the Department of Justice . But the court record amassed since INSLAW Inc. filed for reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws in 1985 discloses an increasingly angry battle over whether Meese and others in the department conspired to drive the computer firm out of business . Meese and other top officials have denied that they mistreated the company , but a federal bankruptcy judge two weeks ago awarded INSLAW $8 million in damages and legal fees after finding that the Justice Department had abused it through " trickery , fraud and deceit . " Other developments also have sparked unusual interest in the case : - The bankruptcy judge , George Bason , has charged that he was not reappointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part because his rulings in the INSLAW case infuriated Justice Department officials. - Leonard Garment , a senior partner of Dickstein , Shapiro and Morin and one of Washington ' s most politically powerful lawyers , has been accused of forcing a lawyer out of the firm because the attorney was too aggressive in pressing INSLAW ' s case. - Lawyers from Garment ' s firm have acknowledged that E. Robert Wallach , who along with Garment represented Meese during his confirmation hearings in 1985 , acted as a go-between in an attempt to settle the case . Although apparently not improper , these contacts have come to the attention of a special prosecutor investigating Meese ' s and Wallach ' s roles in two other cases. - D. Lowell Jensen , a longtime friend of Meese ' s who is now a federal judge in California , has been accused of using his influence while at the Justice Department to cancel INSLAW ' s contract because he had helped develop a different software system years earlier . In turn , department officials have accused Judge Bason of being biased against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " preposterous " ; and Jensen has questioned the quality of INSLAW ' s product . The relatively small company at the center of the dispute is largely the creation of William Hamilton , a stocky , bearded computer expert who once worked at the National Security Agency , the Pentagon ' s top-secret intelligence arm . In the early 1970s , after leaving the agency , Hamilton developed a computer program to assist prosecutors in keeping track of their cases . Called PROMIS ( Prosecutor ' s Management Information System ) , the program was first developed for the U.S. attorney ' s office in Washington and later refined by the federal Law Enforcement Assistance Administration for use by local prosecutors . Hamilton , 47 , formed a nonprofit company to conduct the research , paid for by government grants . In 1981 , when the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration was dissolved , Hamilton incorporated a private company-INSLAW-to market the PROMIS program . It was his contention that though the original , federally financed version was the property of the government , he and his colleagues had made enhancements with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program commercially . The potential for sales was vast . PROMIS already was the best-known program for organizing prosecution caseloads . Hamilton also expected to branch into supplying software to manage court systems , private law offices and probation cases . In March , 1982 , INSLAW signed a $10 million contract with the Justice Department to install the original version of PROMIS in mini-computers in the department ' s 20 largest offices , including Chicago , and to develop a separate program for use in word processing machines in 74 smaller offices . This was by far INSLAW ' s largest contract . If it went well , the prestige seemed likely to help the company expand its business sharply . It did not go well . The first sign of trouble came only eight months later . The Justice Department asked Hamilton for source codes that would permit the department itself to install both the basic PROMIS program and the privately funded enhanced version . Hamilton refused , arguing that some of the software was private property . But he gave in when the government threatened to hold back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government withheld payment on $1. 77 million in costs and fees . It also refused to honor a promise to negotiate payment of licensing fees for use of the enhanced software and stripped INSLAW of the contract involving the smaller U.S. attorney ' s offices . The company filed for bankruptcy in 1985 . By 1983 , Hamilton had become convinced that his difficulties at the Justice Department were not accidental . His suspicion focused on one of the project ' s managers , C. Madison " Brick " Brewer . Hamilton had fired Brewer nearly a decade before from the position of counsel at his nonprofit development company , and he believed Brewer was out for revenge . Brewer never had told superiors at the Justice Department that Hamilton had fired him , court testimony later showed . Brewer testified he thought Hamilton was a " very troubled individual " who had a distorted view of reality . Elliot Richardson , the attorney general under President Richard Nixon who had resigned rather than fire special prosecutor Archibald Cox , was retained by Hamilton . Richardson set out to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being persecuted . For nearly three years , Richardson met with virtually every senior Justice Department official besides Meese in an unsuccessful effort to get them to investigate Brewer ' s activities . Richardson ' s " last-ditch " effort was a second meeting in December , 1985 , with Jensen , then the No. 3 official in the Justice Department who was appointed a federal judge in July , 1986 . " I told . . . ( Jensen ) that I could only conclude that the performance of the department had been scandalous , " Richardson said in a deposition during the bankruptcy proceedings . Jensen ' s response was " noncommittal , " Richardson recalled . But Jensen acknowledged later in a deposition that he volunteered to Richardson that he didn ' t think much of the PROMIS computer program . In fact , Hamilton would later charge in court , Jensen ' s feelings against PROMIS were far deeper than anyone realized . As a district attorney in California in the early 1970s , Jensen had helped develop DALITE , a computer system that unsuccessfully competed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jensen opposed awarding the Justice Department contract to INSLAW in 1981 and took extraordinary interest in the computerization of the U.S. attorneys ' offices . One Justice Department official , William Tyson , who managed administrative matters , would tell Hamilton and a departmental colleague that a " presidential appointee was biased " against PROMIS . But he later insisted it was not Jensen . For Richardson , the chances of settling the case without litigation seemed dim . He introduced Hamilton to Leigh Ratiner , a partner at Dickstein , Shapiro and Morin , a firm with more resources in Washington to conduct a court case and far more clout at the Justice Department . The source of the law firm ' s influence was two men : Garment , an articulate Washington veteran who had been in Nixon ' s White House and was well-connected in news media and Reagan circles , and Wallach , a San Francisco lawyer who had been Meese ' s lifelong friend . Garment and Wallach had represented Meese during a difficult Senate confirmation process and had helped to clear him in a simultaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency , the Justice Department can not be sued for damages in civil court without its agreement . But on June 9 , 1986 , Ratiner filed a $30 million suit in bankruptcy court where it could be heard as part of the effort to recover assets of INSLAW . The suit charged that INSLAW had not been treated fairly in the PROMIS computer program contract and that there was an attempt to force it from reorganization under bankruptcy to liquidation . According to a motion filed by INSLAW last month , the inclusion of Jensen ' s name as a defendant triggered events that led to Ratiner ' s being forced off the case and out of his law firm . Shortly after filing the suit , according to the motion , Ratiner asked Wallach to try to intervene with Meese . Wallach told Ratiner he would be in San Francisco in August and would try to " desensitize " Jensen on the INSLAW case . But a little more than a month later , Wallach came back with a different message : Jensen had " queered " Meese on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer involved in the matter now that he was a judge , " he would always be involved . " According to the motion , Wallach said the Justice Department would " never settle with INSLAW . " Wallach asked that this inside information be withheld from INSLAW , which would have been a violation of ethics for Ratiner , so Ratiner passed it to Hamilton . Three weeks later , on Oct. 12 , the Los Angeles Times published a story on the lawsuit that detailed Jensen ' s alleged bias against INSLAW . At some point after that article , according to information filed in bankruptcy court by the Justice Department , Meese discussed the case with Garment . At about the same time , possibly the same week the article appeared , a five-member " Strategic Planning Committee " including Garment met . At Garment ' s instigation , according to the lawsuit , the group decided to ask Ratiner to leave the law firm . The next week , Ratiner told Hamilton he had been asked to resign and that he believed it was because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In January , 1987 , a group of Dickstein lawyers informed Hamilton that they thought he should settle the case for only $1 million . A week later , Ratiner told Hamilton he had resigned from the case and felt the law firm could no longer properly represent INSLAW . Hamilton then hired new lawyers , including Charles Work and Michael Friedlander of Chicago- based McDermott Will &; Emery , and reluctantly asked Bason to delay a trial on INSLAW ' s charges for five months . " The company ' s credibility in the marketplace had been virtually destroyed by DOJ ' s ( Department of Justice ) vendetta , " INSLAW charged in court papers , " and the only way to restore its credibility with prospective customers was to have a resolution of the case . " Bason later would charge in his ruling that if the allegations were correct , then Meese , Jensen and other top officials " have all been engaged in an effort to obstruct justice in this case by depriving INSLAW of legal representation in this case just before a scheduled trial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s the mildest and also the cleanest word I can use-to suggest that there was any interference by Meese " in the law firm ' s decision to ask Ratiner to leave . " No. 1 , Meese wouldn ' t ask me to do anything like that , " Garment said . " No. 2 , I wouldn ' t do it . And No. 3 , if he did ask me , I ' d tell him to go to hell . " Garment acknowledged that he met with Meese around the time the newspaper article was published to discuss " two or three entirely different matters in the foreign-policy area . " But he said he did not recall discussing the INSLAW matter with Meese . " Any suggestion that the firm or I was involving in dumping the case , because of an express or implied threat by the attorney general or anyone acting on his behalf , or that we were doing anything spontaneously against our client to curry favor there , is a falsehood , " Garment said . Last July , Bason conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than two weeks , the arguments were laid out . They traced the allegations of bias in the handling of the contract , an alleged attempt to force INSLAW to liquidate its firm in bankruptcy and the failure , throughout years of allegations , of the Justice Department to conduct an internal ethics investigation called for in its own regulations . ( Other documents indicate that the Justice Department ' s Office of Professional Responsibility began a review of at least Brewer ' s activities in late 1986 or early 1987 . Such a review can lead to disciplinary action , a recommendation there be a criminal investigation , or a finding the charges are without merit . The department has announced no results in the review . ) On Sept. 29 , Bason ruled in favor of INSLAW , charging the Justice Department used " trickery , fraud and deceit " to steal INSLAW ' s computer software program . " The failure to even begin to investigate is outrageous and indefensible and constitutes an institutional decision by the Department of Justice at the highest level simply to ignore charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , Bason awarded INSLAW a total of $8 million in computer licensing fees and legal costs . Justice Department officials have said they would appeal . For Bason , this was the biggest case he tried in nearly four years on the bankruptcy bench . Instead of renominating him to a 14-year term on the bankruptcy court , a panel of judges selected a former Justice Department official to take the post . Bason appealed in a letter to U.S. Court of Appeals Chief Judge Patricia Wald : " A number of lawyers and others have suggested to me there may be a more sinister , hidden force behind what has happened . . . . They suggest that somehow the Justice Department has undertaken to influence the judicial selection process as a means of retaliation against me for my recent rulings in INSLAW . . . . " Bason then filed suit in U.S. District Court in Washington to try to keep the job . The court rejected his plea . CAPTION : PHOTO : Atty . Gen.
