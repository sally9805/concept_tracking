Those clever Icelanders . Who knew that they secretly craved glamour and attention , the thrill of camera lights and sound bites ? And what better way to capture the limelight than to play host to a meeting of the two most powerful men in the world ? There were times last week when it seemed as if publicity-savvy Icelanders , not Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev , had initiated the summit that was not a summit strictly to promote their little island : Iceland the beautiful ; Iceland the restful ; Iceland , home of friendly blond-haired people with unpronounceable names who believe in elves . <P> But despite what often seemed like a trade fair for Iceland , the summit was an international magnet attracting a constellation of groups competing for attention and airtime : peace demonstrators , the families of refuseniks , Jewish activists , and summit perennials like Waluliso , 73 , a fixture at last year 's Geneva meeting , who wanders around the streets in his trademark bed-sheet toga , with plastic laurels around his head , shrieking for the need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced , the Icelandic government enlisted the services of one of its foremost emissaries , Miss Iceland , who is also the reigning Miss World . Holmfridur Karlsdottir , a blue-eyed nursery-school teacher , was called back from a trip to Singapore to dress up Reykjavk by traipsing around wearing a **31;18377;TOOLONG T shirt . " It 's fabulous for Iceland ! " she exclaimed . " It 's the best publicity we could ever get . " She was the soul of congeniality , but she adamantly refused to pose in a swimsuit . Prime Minister Steingrimur Hermannsson , on the other hand , showed no such reluctance . Hermannsson , who often takes a midday dip , was interviewed by television reporters while wearing only his swimming togs . <P> A round of official Icelandic receptions was politely turned down by the U.S. and Soviet delegations ; both pleaded the burdens of work . But with a news black-out in effect much of the time , reporters bore no such burdens . The Icelanders essentially put on a huge trade show for their captive audience of some 2,000 journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school was transformed into the " Iceland Center , " complete with a generous spread of local delicacies ( herring , smoked lamb and skyr , which is said to taste like honey-flavored yogurt ) . Outside the press center , half a dozen honey-colored Icelandic ponies pranced in a light rain while their blue-blazered riders carried U.S. , Soviet and Icelandic flags on long poles . The government also arranged a three-hour fishing excursion and a free dinner at the country 's largest disco , Broadway . <P> By the time the U.S. and Soviet support staffs had arrived in Reykjavk , stores were already brimming with summit souvenirs . There were Icelandic wool sweaters with profiles of Reagan and Gorbachev ( $45 ) , scarves with the Stars and Stripes on one end and the hammer and sickle on the other ( $20 ) and all manner of Reagan-Gorbachev T shirts celebrating the great event ( $11.44 ) . Top of the line was a commemorative ashtray with real gold lettering ( $50 ) . Some of the stores opened their doors on Sunday to satisfy souvenir-mad summiteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
