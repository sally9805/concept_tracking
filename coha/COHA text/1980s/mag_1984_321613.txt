Reagan 's decision widens rifts at home and abroad <P> The ambiguity and confusion that surrounded the Reagan Administration 's latest military moves in Lebanon quickly took on a life of their own last week . From Capitol Hill to the Mediterranean littoral and beyond , both friends and foes of the White House reacted with concern and dismay to what they saw as sudden twists and turns of U.S. policy in coping with the increasingly unmanageable situation in Beirut . In the process , rifts were opened between the Reagan Administration and Congress , between the U.S. and its closest Western and Middle Eastern allies , and even between President Reagan and some of his staunchest conservative supporters .
