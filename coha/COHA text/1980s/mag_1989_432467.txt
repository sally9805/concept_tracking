 | The Subterranean Abode of the demon dwarf Semar lies in the geographic heart of Java , on the fulminous , mountain-ringed Diyeng Plateau . Devout Javanese believe this cave is the center of the world , the most sacred place in creation . More than once Darmudji , its caretaker , had accompanied Indonesian President Suharto into the cave to meditate and pray ? or so Darmudji said , as he unlocked the small iron gate . By candlelight I crawled after him down into the chill , cramped darkness . Darmudji lit a packet of incense and joined his bony hands above his head . I supposed he intended to offer a prayer to the mischievous Semar , most beloved and purely Javanese of deities . Instead , reflecting the diverse faiths that have washed up on Java 's shores over centuries , the old man invoked the Hindu deities Brahma , Siva , and Vishnu , then Buddha , Muhammad , Adam , and Jesus Christ . Not long after , on northern Sumatra 's swampy coast , I observed another subterranean phenomenon . P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part by Pertamina , the government 's energy monopoly , was tapping a deposit of natural gas 10,000 feet below . A high-pressure mix of methane , ethane , propane , butane , pentane , carbon dioxide , and nitrogen gushed into a ten-story cooling tower . I stood on the steel scaffolding of the tower , one hand pressed against it , eardrums bursting from the roar . Inside , refrigerants reduced the temperature of the swirling gases to minus 260 ? F. Liquid gas flowed from storage into thermos-bottle holds of waiting tankers . " Basically , " explained Efren Rocha , P. T. Arun 's technical training coordinator , " it 's the same process as your home refrigerator 's , only colder . " And potentially almost unimaginably more volatile . The plant sits atop an estimated 14 trillion cubic feet of natural gas , one of the world 's largest fields . As training adviser Richard Burton put it only half jokingly , " One misplaced spark could rearrange the topography of northern Sumatra . " Two worlds , time apart , coexist in presentday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Mochtar Kusumaatmadja , former foreign minister , told me . " He is marginal man : one foot in the present , one in ancient traditions . But he is changing fast . " JAVA AND SUMATRA are but two of the more than 13,660 wildly beautiful islands of the Republic of Indonesia , a nation populated by 180 million people of some 300 ethnic groups speaking 250 different languages ? the fifth most populous nation in the world , after China , India , the Soviet Union , and the United States . Indonesia stretches across 3,200 miles of water , separating the Indian Ocean from the Pacific . On a map of the Western Hemisphere , it would reach from Oregon to Bermuda . The colonial Dutch exploited Indonesia for nearly 350 years but never united the islands under a central administration .

The Indonesian melting pot includes exquisitely refined Javanese , carefree Sundanese , artistic Balinese , seafaring Buginese , industrious Manadonese , and a dozen other " - ese , " including traces of the Portuguese , who claimed the islands for the West in 1510 . But finding a balance between unity and diversity has proved difficult . The nation is beset with staggering problems . Conflicts and divisions cut through Indonesian society . Chief among these is Java 's overwhelming political and economic dominance over the rest of the islands . " We call the Javanese the new colonials , ' " a Manado journalist told me . President Suharto ( like many Javanese , he goes by just one name ) is the central figure in this drama ? a personal and political force that binds the far-flung islands together . Son of a Javanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Dutch and rose to major general 's rank by the early 1960s . By 1965 his young nation was foundering on the spendthrift nationalism and political excess of its first president , Sukarno , and drifting toward takeover by the Indonesian Communist Party , then the largest Communist Party in the world outside China and the Soviet Union . Suharto moved swiftly , unseating Sukarno and taking command of the country . His very first action led to the liquidation of the Communist Party ? a bloodbath resulting in 250,000 to 500,000 deaths . A considerable number who died were ethnic Chinese . Twenty-four years later Indonesian Chinese schools , political parties , even Chinese ideograms are banned . The Chinese have been prime targets of the violence that periodically engulfs Jakarta . Yet they are the richest of all Indonesian groups , owning as much as 75 percent of the nation 's private capital . Suharto 's rule has been both ironhanded and subtle . After the massacre Suharto neutralized refractory political parties , opened Indonesia 's long-closed doors to foreign aid and investment , and proclaimed political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Order regime . The 1970s oil boom ( Indonesia has proven reserves of nine billion barrels ) provided the means for economic development . A team of University of California-trained economists known as the " Berkeley Mafia " provided the direction . Today blacktop highways twine through the mountains and jungles of Sumatra , Sulawesi , and far-off Irian Jaya . Some 136,000 new primary schools dot distant villages . Communications satellites orbit overhead , linking the 27 provinces with Jakarta , the nation 's capital . Rice production has doubled . Massive industrial projects like the P. T. Arun natural-gas facility testify to the title often given to Suharto : Bapak Pembangunan , the Father of Development . 105  | But 24 years is a long time in the political heat of equatorial Asia . Increasingly many Indonesians wonder aloud what will come after Suharto . Although a new generation of leaders , including young army officers more attuned than their elders to Western democratic values , waits impatiently in the wings , Suharto has not yet groomed a successor . " As a modern president , Suharto must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his closest advisers explained . " But he rules in the tradition of Javanese kings . The moment the king chooses a successor , the wahyu , the divine ruling power , National Geographic , January 1989 sia : Two Woi @#  | begins to slip away . So he can not do that. ? In the 1987 elections Golongan Karya ( known simply as Golkar ) , Suharto 's pervasive , army-backed political organization , won 73 percent of the seats in the House of Representatives . Suharto then appointed a hundred army officers to that body and all 500 members of the People 's Consultative Assembly . The two houses then reelected him to his fifth five-year term . By Javanese standards Suharto is a very old man . Yet in these , his waning years , his powers are being tested as perhaps never before . For the past four years economic growth has barely kept ahead of population growth . Per capita income has stayed at about $530 a year ? even lower than in the Philippines . The number of people underemployed is 40 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each year , far more than the new jobs available . About 50 percent of the population is under the age of 20 . EVEN MORE than in other developing countries , Indonesia 's politics are forged by the hammers of international economics . The 1983 oil-price collapse brought the loss of 28 percent of government revenues . Suharto slashed the budget , instituted sweeping tax and banking reforms , and devalued the rupiah three times in four years . Then the U. S. dollar nose-dived . Since Indonesia borrows mainly in Japanese yen , its foreign debt rose as the dollar fell against the yen . With additional borrowing the debt is now 50 billion dollars . Repayment consumes 38 percent of annual earnings , an index the World Bank considers dangerously high . Corruption compounds the problem . Long @#  | endemic , it embraces everything from simple pungli ( payoffs ) to complex international deals .

Suharto 's immediate family and various relatives and associates are among the beneficiaries . Indeed , to Jakarta wags Suharto 's wife , Tien , has long been irreverently known as " Madam Tien-percent . " The king of the cukongs is 72-year-old Liem Sioe Liong , a Fujian emigre who started out in the rebellion against the Dutch after World War II running supplies to a rebel colonel named Suharto . As custodian of the first family 's fortunes , Liem now bestrides a colossus of 190 companies with interests ranging from cooking oil to Krakatau Steel . I discussed corruption and other concerns with President Suharto in a private two-hour interview at his corn-and-cattle ranch in the hills of Tapos , south of Jakarta . A man of prodigious girth with the serene smile of a jovial deity , Suharto was voluble and immensely self-assured . He flatly rejected my suggestion that his family and friends may have benefited from his high office . " There is no such thing as favoritism , sir , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one eye closed . " I sought to lighten the moment . " Surely , Mr. President , " I said , " as a former soldier , you know that you must close one eye to take aim at the target . " Suharto roared . But his eyes were hard as ice . " Even with both eyes closed , I still can shoot ! " he replied . Suharto blamed " red tape , bureaucracy , 109  | hanky-panky , and irresponsible elements " for Indonesia 's " high-cost economy . " " We are trying to reorder and reform , " he said , adding significantly : " We will continue to do that , sir , so that we can become really competitive ! " And when the time comes for a peaceful transfer of power , what then ? " The constitution clearly stipulates the rules of succession , " Suharto said over telur asin ( salted eggs ) and lontong ( rice cakes in banana leaves ) .

" JAKARTA is capital and heartland of Indonesia , a rags-to-riches rijsttafel ? rice table of many dishes ? of eight million people . From on high this city on the north Java shore is a vast patchwork of mossy , orange tile roofs , green trees , and countless kampung ( villages ) . To the west lies a warren of huts and bubbling black-water canals where people bathe and brush their teeth while others defecate into the same water from bamboo scaffolds . To the east stretches leafy Menteng , a graceful , whitewashed quarter of Old World mansions and New World wealth . Down the middle runs ten-lane Jalan Thamrin , the nation 's principal boulevard and nerve center , lined with foreign embassies , luxury hotels , and futuristic glass-and-steel towers . Over all stands the 430-foot-high National Monument , a marble pillar with 77 pounds of pure gold on its crowning flame ? a symbol of the profligacy of the Sukarno era . In Jakarta 's streets runs Dr. Kusumaatmadja 's marginal man . Hybrid dangdut music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudspeakers in gaily lighted Taman Ria Park . Sinewy-legged becak ( pedicab ) drivers loll at curbside . Perfumed banci ( transvestites ) and WTS 's ( women of injured morals ) flirt with passersby . Sidewalk hawkers and fast-food peddlers pushing carts called kaki-lima ( five feet ) ? meaning two wheels , a stand stick , and the proprietor 's own two feet ? proffer everything from Gucci-like bags and Levi's-like jeans to sate ( kabobs ) and sop kaki ( goat 's feet soup ) . These people are part of an underground economy . Dr. Mary Judd , an American anthropologist , estimates that they represent more than a quarter of the city 's labor force . They toil up to 16 hours a day and consider themselves lucky . Their earnings average well above the $62.50 monthly base salary of university-educated government workers . By some estimates as much as a fourth of Jakarta is without housing .

" Say salamat sore ( good afternoon ) and give plenty smile . " If Jakarta is Java 's harsh , hard-scrabbling present , Yogyakarta , 270 miles to the southeast , is its past ? the seat of culture , repository of its mystical tradition . Not far away Our 4 ' , stand Borobudur , the world 's largest , most 1 magnificent Buddhist monument , and 112  | Prambanan , a soaring cluster of tenth-century Hindu temples . In Yogya itself ( as it is fondly called ) is the kraton , the sprawling palace of Java 's last sultan , who recently passed away at the age of 76 . He was a man so revered that snippets of his hair , fingernails , and clothes were offered up each year to Merapi and Lawu volcanoes and cast in the waters of the goddess of the southern seas . I called at the unpretentious home of His Majesty Prince Poerboyo , the sultan 's elder brother and the kraton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man emerged and extended a small , soft hand . " Poerboyo , " he said simply . " How can I serve you ? " " I would like to go through the kraton with you as my guide , " I told him . " I want to know what the sultanate means to you . " He made a small , gracious bow . Next morning we walked together through the kraton 's massive gates into a sun-dappled courtyard flanked by large , low , open-sided buildings called pendopo , some of them more than 200 years old . There was no sense of height , as in Western palaces : Star apple trees rose above the rooftops . The feeling was of spaciousness , antiquity , and peace . Prince Poerboyo pointed out a gong dating back to the 14th-century Majapahit Empire , Java 's golden age . " They can not make those any more , " he said . " They do n't know how to produce the sound : G-o-o-o-n-g ! ' " He shrugged . " Today : Gong . ' Finished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we examined the artifacts of Java 's past . In the throne room officials used to come and kiss the sultan 's knees . " The sultan abolished the big ceremonies , " His Majesty said approvingly . " He never used the throne after the Japanese invasion . " In one pendopo , palace servants sat on the marble floor , giving lovely carved-leather wayang kulit puppets their weekly airing and animatedly chatting with them as if they were alive . I recalled reading that years ago the announcement of a rare wayang kulit performance of Bharatayudha , the final cosmic battle of the gods , had provoked widespread fears that the drama might precipitate the end of the world ? and sure enough , during the performance , Merapi exploded . " Did that really happen ? " I asked . " Yes , " His Majesty replied . I pressed : " What do you make of it ? " He looked me in the eye , thought a moment , and chuckled . " Coincidence . " BETWEEN JAKARTA AND YOGYA stretches Java 's lush , rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trim green coffee and tea plantations that roll up the flanks of scores of volcanoes steaming and soaring into billowing thunderheads . Indeed , to a foreigner , Java is a primeval world of such 113  | astonishing beauty that it is hard to believe it is so beset with woes . But if the cities have their problems , they pale beside those of the island as a whole . More than a hundred million Javanese , nearly two-thirds of the nation 's population , inhabit the island 's 51,000 square miles ? more people than the combined populations of California , Texas , Pennsylvania , Illinois , Florida , and Ohio , jammed into an area just a bit larger than Louisiana . Java is one of the world 's most densely populated rural societies , and is likely to remain so . A family-planning program instituted in 1970 has been hailed as one of the most successful anywhere . Roadside posters proclaim its motto , " Duo anak cukup ! ? Two children are enough ! " But the population is still growing at the rate of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against time . We simply have to win it , " Dr. Masri Singarimbun , founder of the Population Institute at Gajah Mada University in Yogyakarta , said . " But how can you win ? " I asked . " Yes , " he replied , " that is the question . " PROGRESS sometimes creates more problems . " Our schools are turning out millions of children with six years ' primary education , " a Jakarta educator told me worriedly . " They 're spoiled for farming , but they ca n't afford higher education , and there are no jobs . So they hang out in gangs . Crime goes up . Respect for elders goes down . Society begins to unravel . "  | About half of Java 's people are farmers . Eight out of ten own land , in most cases not enough , or barely enough , to live on . Indebtedness is inevitable ? and this results in the sale of the land to industry , bringing still greater pressures on the land that is left . " Too many people bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering to the people , " says Dr. Otto Soemarwoto , director of the Institute of Ecology at Padjadjaran University in Bandung . " As population 116 grows , upland forests are leveled for settlements . The rains tear away the denuded soil and wash it down to choke the flatlands . More roads and houses are built . The soil becomes less permeable . Lowland water tables are n't replenished . Dry seasons become droughts ; rainy seasons turn into floods . " Human waste is dumped into the water supply and recycled back into the people . At least 60 percent of the population is infested with parasitic worms . " AFTER A LIFETIME of such conditions , Pak Manto had had it . The half acre he and his wife , Suminten , tilled outside the central Java city of Surakarta was barely enough to keep them and their three children alive . So seven years ago they boarded a government C-130 Hercules airplane for Balikpapan , on the eastern coast of Kalimantan , Indonesian Borneo . They then traveled by bus , truck , and riverboat 115 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rimba Ayu and the five-acre homestead the government had promised . " There was no water , " Manto , now 43 , told me in the dirt-floored house his family occupies in Rimba Ayu today . " The land was so overgrown we could n't see the house . I said to my wife , We better get to work . ' We 've been working ever since . " Manto and Suminten have survived a seven-month drought , a five-month-long jungle fire , an epidemic of Newcastle disease that killed all but two of their chickens , and a plague of rats that devoured their seed . But today they own a carabao , grow enough rice , soybeans , corn , and chickens for consumption and sale , and they 'll soon be marketing cloves , coffee , and hybrid coconuts as well . And Suminten , when I visited , was pregnant again . Manto 's fingers curled around his teacup like gnarled roots . " I 'm pretty content , " he grinned , silver front tooth gleaming . " I 'm just waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one of more than 700,000 Indonesian families who have been relocated through the government 's transmigration program from the overcrowded regions of Java , Madura , Bali , and Lombok to some 600 outer-island settlements . Each family is supposed to receive a tworoom house and five acres of land , as well as food , tools , seed , fertilizer , and pesticides.  | Transmigration minister Martono called it the " largest voluntary resettlement program in the world . " It is also one of the most controversial . Despite 400 million dollars in World Bank aid over the past decade , the program has made no appreciable impact on Java 's miseries , and the country is running out of arable land . " Today , " one Indonesian expert told me , - much of the land allocated can not even be described as marginal . " I they get back less than 3 percent . Parts of Although nearly 90 percent of Indonesians call themselves Muslim , the majority are nominal adherents who intermix Islam with other practices and creeds . Not so the Acehnese . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sumatra 's mountains and the Indian Ocean embrace the Prophet with militant zeal . Their land is Indonesia 's western terminus , its closest point to Mecca . The Acehnese were probably the first to encounter Islam 's proselytizing traders as early as the seventh century . Much of their bloody history since has been written in defense of the faith . In 1953 they even went to war against Jakarta , a six-year jihad that was brought under control when the government proclaimed Aceh a ' special territory " ? a state within a state where Islamic law prevails . Aceh 's defiance has left the region dirtpoor . Its natural gas , petroleum , rubber , and palm oil represent 15 percent of the nation 's export revenues . Embittered Acehnese claim Aceh remain rebellious ? and Indonesian Army units remain on alert nearby . " Islam is not closed to modernization , " Professor H. A. Hasjmy , head of Aceh 's nsajelis ulama ( council of scholars ) and former governor , told me . And that may be true . But Acehnese tend to be resistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can die doing that !

But they attribute that to Allah 's wrath , not lack of sanitation . " In Banda Aceh , the capital , the magnificent black-domed Mesjid Raya Baiturrahman ? Great Mosque ? looms over a blue reflecting pool . Beside it garbage is heaped in broken streets ; rivers are clogged with trash . I I  | Six hours to the east by car stands the modern installation of P. T. Arun . Its elegant hilltop employees enclave contrasts sharply with the filthy , overcrowded city of Lhokseumawe . The city 's population has doubled to 60,000 since P. T. Arun opened in 1978 , but its people hold fewer than a thousand jobs at the plant . " Our aim has been to employ as many Acehnese as we can , " insisted manufacturing manager James Winget , an American who has since been replaced by a Javanese . " But they simply lack the skills . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a produce market , " said one of P. T. Arun 's Indonesian supervisors , as we drove through the city . " All they ever ask for is , A mosque ! A mosque ! A mosque ! ' " WHEN THE SUN is high and hot , a chill wind hoots across the black rock summit of 10,308-foot Gunung Agung , the volcano the Balinese call the " navel of the world . " The mountain falls away in black lava ridges that look like dragon backs ? relics of the 1963 eruption that claimed more than 1,500 lives ? to green plains and blue seas and a view of far-off Lombok island 's own black smoking peaks . Gasping for breath after the steep climb , I stood on the summit and marveled at the impossible beauty of the scene .

Made 's ancestors had their roots in Hindu Java until the spread of Islam in the 15th century drove them with their nobles and priests to seek sanctuary across the narrow strait between the islands . There the faith was wedded to animistic magic and draped in splendid robes of ritual and art . Alone among islanders , Balinese turn their backs to the sea , which they deem profane , and look to the mountains .

" FATE has dealt more harshly with the people of East Timor , a province half the size of Maryland with 650,000 mostly Roman Catholic inhabitants . It was a forgotten remnant of Portugal 's ramshackle empire until the Portuguese armed forces seized power in Lisbon in 1974 and summarily freed their nation 's overseas possessions . In East Timor an organization called the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor ( FRETILIN ) prevailed over other hastily formed political groups , and in 1975 it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an Asian Cuba , he moved 35,000 troops into East Timor and proclaimed it Indonesia 's 27th province .

By Jakarta 's own figures , at least 100,000 Timorese have been killed in the fighting or have died of starvation and disease . Some 40,000 children have been left orphaned , abandoned , crippled , or maimed . And at least 600 civilians have simply disappeared . " Practically speaking , " Governor Mario Carrascalao told me in his office in Dili , the Timorese capital , " every family in East Timor has lost someone in this civil war . " Normally journalists are not allowed into the province , but I was granted a three-day visit in the company of a foreign-office 121  | official . The army refused access to the eastern part of the province , where FRETILIN is said to be most active .

Its hospital boasts 200 beds , a general practitioner , a pharmacist , two dentists , and a radiologist . The University of East Timor opened in 1986 . " The library has just 10,000 books , " the energetic Dr. Armindo Maia , a university rector , told me as we walked the corridors . " That 's not much for a university ? but it 's a start !

But Yosfiah neglected to mention that another command of 14 battalions ? 12,000 men ? was reportedly bivouacked in the east , where we were not permitted to go . More difficult to measure was a climate of fear that I felt where we did go . Former FRETILIN rebels talked as if reciting a script . Ordinary Timorese would n't talk at all . Outside Dili they cowered at the approach of our official jeep . Carrascalao offered an explanation : " We are in transition from horror to normalcy .

" We got into his red pickup truck and bounced down the packed-rock road and over a splendid new steel-girder bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @# road stopped abruptly at the foot of a wall rising to black rock pillars that frame the valley . Simanjuntak pointed to a distant 45-degree slope . " That 's the only earth around . The rest is solid rock . " He flashed a big cando grin . " So we 're going to switchback up that ridge . " How long before the road is completed ? " If we had the money , ten more years , " Simanjuntak replied . How long with budget cutbacks ? He shook his head . " Maybe 25 . " The most primitive people in the province are the Maskona tribe , who inhabit a region known as the Bird 's Head at the island 's western tip . Their land is impenetrable jungle karst pocked with sinkholes and ravines , separated from the coast by 7,000- to 10,000-foot peaks . Until a decade ago the Maskona fought brutal tribal wars , killed outsiders who trespassed on their lands , and lived in tree houses 40 feet above the jungle floor . Then Christian missionaries began to change traditional ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the tribe is by air ? and that 's how the missionaries came . I went in on a missionary resupply helicopter and landed among a cluster of thatch-roofed huts on the flank of a mountain the Maskona call Very High Stone . Some 500 tribesmen clustered around the chopper . John and Linda Price , Americans from the Christian Bible Church who are studying the tribal language , bade me welcome and led me to the barkwalled hut that would be my quarters for the night . What I hoped to learn was just how Indonesian these people had become . Maskona tribesmen crowded around to tell me . They had obviously been reached by politics . Musa Rocomna , the wiry , tattooed tribal kepala ( chief ) , wore a yellow Golkar cap . I asked Rocomna if he had heard about the Second World War . " I never even heard about the first one , " he replied . A bright-eyed 16-year-old named Efradus served as spokesman for the group . " Eight years ago we did n't know what country we were in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaya , electricity , movies , TV , or money . " How had the government made its presence known ? " They came three years ago and told us not to kill the missionaries , " Efradus recounted . I asked him who the president of Indonesia was . " Pak Suharto , " he answered promptly , using the short  | familiar form of bapak , the formal word for father . His smile lit up the hut . " He 's the big kepala ! " WHAT IS IT that holds this extraordinarily diverse nation of Indonesia together ? Over lunch in his office Emil Salim , the minister for population and environment , proposed the Five Principles , the Pancasila . I professed National Geographic , January 1989 Two I4b 1  | skepticism . " Consider Korea , China , Germany , " he explained . " Each is one people divided by nothing but ideology . Now think of us , who are so many different peoples , with so many disintegrating forces at work . " Pancasila is like a star , " Salim continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars in the sky , and 180 million Indonesians . What if they all wanted to follow a different star ? Our nation is still very young . It 's constantly changing . But I know that all of our people agree upon the same star ! " Only once before have these islands come under the sway of central rule ? the Majapahit Empire in the 14th century . An immensely gifted leader named Gajah Mada had been responsible . And I realized then that young Efradus had it right . It takes a big kepala to hold this land together ? a really big kepala . And I wondered : After Pak Suharto , who in the world might that kepala be ? c , January 1989 127
