The new portable computers are handy chips off the old block <P> Last summer , when Adam Osborne , former computer columnist turned entrepreneur , put his Osborne 1 computer on the market , small had never seemed so beautiful . Despite its graceless design-a cross between a World War II field radio and a shrunken instrument panel of a DC-3-the 24-lb. machine combined most of the features of a fully loaded Apple or Radio Shack computer . Better yet , it was completely portable . Sales immediately took off , and some 30,000 units have been sold to date . Osborne carry-along machines are already being used in courtrooms ( lawyers ' briefs can be recalled on the screen for a quick read ) , in the wilds of Kenya ( to gather zoological research ) and in war-torn Afghanistan ( U.S. Freelance Writer David Kline used one to file news reports ) . Where no electric socket exists , the machines operate on portable battery packs . <P> Now more and more companies are jockeying for a slice of Osborne 's success . Last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a dozen U.S. and foreign manufacturers were hawking portable computers that fit on the decks of pleasure boats , under airline seats , into attach cases-even in the palm of the hand . Four of the new machines were Osborne imitations featuring built-in video , detachable typewriterlike keyboards and luggage-type carrying handles . While several models improved on the Osborne 's eye-straining 5-in. screen , only one-manufactured by Non-Linear Systems Inc. in Solana Beach , Calif. , and sold by Kay Computers-matched its price , $1,795 . Osborne still retains the distinction of having produced the Volkswagen of computers . <P> At the pricier end of the market , Grid Systems of Mountain View , Calif. , offers the Mercedes-Benz version . It has a thin , flat screen , folds into a sleek 9-lb. magnesium package and slips easily into the bottom half of a briefcase . The Compass Computer , as it is called , packs considerable storage capacity-enough to handle the wordage of a long novel . " It 's a truly stunning engineering achievement , " says one industry analyst . Equally stunning , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cheapest hand-held machines , like Radio Shack 's new TRS-80 PC2 ( $280 ) , are likely to be the most popular , despite drawbacks . Their tiny , one-line display screens are better for solving engineering problems or showing long strings of numbers than for serious writing or business programming , and their calculator-type keyboards are much harder to master than those of larger desktop computers . But they remind some users of the proverbial dog walking on its hind legs : what is surprising is not how well they work , but that they work at all . One U.S. insurance company is considering buying 25,000 of Matsushita 's $380 HHC model to let its salesmen calculate premiums right before potential customers ' eyes .
