Dear Abby : The letter from the mother of a girl who had been taken advantage of by people for whom she baby-sat reminded me of a job I had in college . A young couple got my name from a friend of mine and asked me to sit with their two children until midnight . They picked me up at my dorm , and when we got to their house I was informed that I was spending the night there so they wouldn ' t have to drive me home in the middle of the night ! Being the polite person I was taught to be , and needing the money , I slept in a nightgown the lady loaned me and spent the night there . The next morning the husband drove me back to my dorm where I found a dozen messages from my boyfriend back home . He was livid because I had been out all night . ( He never did believe my story . ) Also Taken Advantage of Dear Also : It may not help you much to be told now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may find themselves in a similar predicament : Do not allow yourself to be manipulated . Speak up . Say , " I ' m sorry . This isn ' t what I agreed to do , and I am unable to accommodate you . " Period . Learning assertiveness early in life may not be easy , but it will be a valuable lifelong asset . Dear Abby : I have a beard , which I keep nicely trimmed and well-groomed . When I recently applied for a job as a salesperson in a large retail store , I was told that if I wanted to work there I would have to shave off my beard . ( I didn ' t like the idea , but I agreed to shave off my beard if they decided to hire me . ) Abby , this company is saying that bearded salesmen are not acceptable , but if bearded men want to shop there they will be glad to take their money . I think companies that practice this kind of discrimination should be boycotted . What is your opinion ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beards are attractive , but I am not setting policy for employees in a place of business . To refuse to hire a man because he has a beard is a form of discrimination , but it is the employer ' s right to hire salespeople who best represent the company ' s image . The ball is in your court now . If you want the job , shave your beard . And if you don ' t want to shop there , it ' s your right to shop elsewhere . Dear Abby : I must disagree with those who think applauding in a house of worship is disrespectful and unacceptable behavior . Hogwash ! When my son was married , half an hour before the wedding we had a violent rainstorm that cut off all the electricity at our church . Of course , that meant there would be no organ music , so our priest instructed the guests to applaud the bridal couple as they entered and walked down the aisle . I don ' t believe God was offended . Claire in Ontario , Canada  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank-you notes , letters of sympathy , etc. because you don ' t know what to say .
