While city officials say there are few , if any , employees with only these minimum qualifications , the city is reviewing the staffing procedures for the 385 day-care programs that receive municipal funds. // The review began soon after seven employees of such centers in Manhattan and the Bronx were arrested earlier this month on charges of sexual abuse . <> <> Fingerprinting Planned // // The minimum age and educational qualifications for employees are among the matters under review , according to Doby L. Flowers , head of the Agency for Child Development . Miss Flowers said that starting Oct. 1 , the city would also fingerprint all day-care employees to check for prior criminal records. // " We are reviewing all our policies and procedures , " she said in a recent interview in her office at 240 Church Street . " It ' s a problem that everybody ' s concerned with. " // Under current policy , the hiring and screening of the 8 , 200 day-care employees are done entirely by the community organizations that run the 354 centers and 31 home-care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rejects the community organizations ' choices . No criminal checks are made . <> <> A 20 Percent Turnover Rate // // " We have always said to the centers , ' They are your employees and you must do the background checks , ' " Miss Flowers said . She said the agency had no other way to keep up with the 20 percent turnover in employees every year. // The centers are licensed by the city ' s Health Department , which sets the criteria for both the personnel and the buildings. // According to Dr. Mark Rapoport , deputy commissioner of health , day- care teachers must have the equivalent of a bachelor ' s degree in early-childhood education . Teachers ' assistants must be at least 18 years old and have high school diplomas . Teachers ' aides must be at least 18 years old and be able to read and write at an eighth- grade level. // Dr. Rapoport said the department required no other qualifications for employees of a licensed day-care center . He said the building requirements involved such things as proper electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qualifications // // Although she did not have exact figures , Miss Flowers said that many , if not most , workers hired at city-financed centers had more than the minimum qualifications . She said salary incentives encouraged many aides and assistants to continue their education after they were hired. // Depending on education and length of service , teachers ' salaries range from $15 , 359 to $22 , 699 a year . Assistant teachers earn $12 , 450 to $16 , 284 , and teachers ' aides $11 , 900 to $13 , 563 . Most teachers ' aides work only part-time and are paid accordingly. // Miss Flowers said education alone could not guarantee qualified workers. // " It ' s hard to say what the threshold level for employees should be , " she said . " There is no one type of person who is a child abuser . There are people at all levels of credentialing who would not make good child-care workers. " // But some employees and officials at the Eisman Day Nursery , at 124 West 95th Street , said they believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // // " I frown on having such a low minimum , " said Jean Chung , who has been the director of the city-financed nursery since 1969 . " At 18 years old , what experience does the person have ? If they have an eighth-grade reading level , how can they write progress reports on the child ? " // Teachers ' aides and assistants are responsible for some programming in the day-care centers , and they work in tandem with teachers . Aides are never left in charge of a class , though assistants may be , Miss Flowers said. // Miss Chung said that all 10 day-care employees at Eisman had at least some college credits and that she did not hire anyone , regardless of the job , without at least a high school diploma . She is responsible for screening and hiring all employees and said the task was difficult. // " I almost never know instantly that someone is the right person , " she said . " It ' s a 50-50 chance . It ' s a stranger you ' re working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubbling and interested in young children when you interview them or they ' ll never make it. " // Miss Chung said she checked the employment histories and educational qualifications of applicants and then forwarded her recommendations to the nursery ' s board . There is a 90-day probationary period for newly hired workers . <> <> Care in Hiring Applauded // // " It took a couple of months before Miss Chung could decide on me , " said Linda Lowenthal , who has worked as a teacher ' s aide at the nursery for five years and has more than 10 years ' experience in private and public day-care centers . " They checked out all my credentials . But I was glad , because it meant I was being hired by a reputable place. " // Nicomedes Sanchez , chairman of the Puerto Rican Association for Community Affairs , said his organization used similar screening until the Praca day-care center that it ran in the Bronx was closed Aug. 2 after two teachers ' aides and a teacher ' s assistant were arrested on charges of child abuse. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our practice to give preference to anyone from the community , " Mr. Sanchez said . " So most of us had a least a neighborly knowledge of each other even before employees were hired . " <> <> No Guarantees on Screening // // Even with criminal background checks , there is no guarantee that employees who might abuse children will be screened out . Only one of the Praca employees arrested this month had a criminal record , according to Edward McCarthy , a spokesman for District Attorney Mario Merola of the Bronx . The suspect with the record , Jesus Torres , a 29-year-old aide at the center , had a narcotics conviction. // Barbara Killiebrew , a teacher ' s assistant at Eisman , started working at the center as an aide 14 years ago , when she was 19 and just out of high school . She has since taken courses in early-childhood education at New York University and City College. // " I wouldn ' t necessarily say the standards are too low , " Mrs. Killiebrew said . " I ' ve seen situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nap time till they were so tired you couldn ' t get anything done . And I ' ve seen people with no degrees who were great. " // //
