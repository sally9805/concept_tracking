But the revolutionary talks of reconciliation <P> The tension hung heavy over Zimbabwe Rhodesia early last week , almost as if the bloody seven-year civil war were still raging . In Salisbury , armored personnel carriers rolled through the streets and clusters of armed Rhodesian soldiers gathered nervously on the corners as helicopter gunships swooped low over the city . Out in the bush , at the Alpha cease-fire camp , Sergeant Roy Rowley of the Rhodesian African Rifles noted grimly : " Now I know what it 's like to be waiting for the end of the world . " <P> For many of the 212,000 white citizens of the breakaway British colony , the election results announced last week indeed marked the end of their world . Robert Gabriel Mugabe , 56 , the implacable , ascetic revolutionary and guerrilla leader , had won by a landslide . In three days of balloting for 80 black seats in the 100-member House of Assembly , Mugabe 's Zimbabwe African National Union ( ZANU ) had swept up 57 seats and 63% of the popular vote . Mugabe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa 's postcolonial history . Lord Soames , the British-appointed Governor , immediately asked him to form a government as Prime Minister-designate . The news sent thousands of jubilant blacks streaming into the streets , singing , dancing , crowing and wildly flapping their arms in emulation of Jongwe - the Shona word for Mugabe 's campaign symbol , a rooster . <P> But there was little rejoicing among the whites .

Said a Salisbury secretary : " How can we accept what we have fought against for so long ? " Some white Rhodesians talked bitterly of " gapping it " - their Rugby-derived term for emigrating . <P> Belying his image among whites as a fanatical Marxist , Mugabe issued an eloquent call for peace and reconciliation in his first address to the nation . " It is time to beat our swords into plowshares , " he declared . " There is room for everyone in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all Zimbabweans . " Mugabe pledged not to impose any sweeping nationalization of private property and promised to bring members of other parties into a broad-based government . <P> One of his initial moves was to reforge his old links with Joshua Nkomo , 62 , his former co-leader in the Patriotic Front guerrilla alliance . Running on a separate platform , the bulky , jovial Nkomo had won only 20 seats , mostly in his Matabele tribal stronghold . He accepted Mugabe 's invitation to join forces with him in a " national front " coalition . Nkomo was reportedly offered Zimbabwe 's figurehead presidency , but he may hold out for a Cabinet post .
