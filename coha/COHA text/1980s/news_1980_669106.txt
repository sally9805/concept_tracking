" It ' s been done , " said the woman from Australia. // " Get in line , " said the TV broadcaster from Canada . " A dozen companies are ahead of you . Everyone in Hollywood wants to be the first to make a film here. " // We were in the Hotel Peking , sitting at a curious sidewalk cafe on the passageway between the old and new wings of the hotel . In looking at the people at the tables , it was not hard to tell which ones lived and did business in the Chinese capital and which were visitors. // " Isn ' t it exciting being here ! " said the woman from San Francisco . She was a magazine writer , a visitor , and , like me , one of 10 journalists being shown around . As she glanced at the tables , a grin of elation became stuck on her face. // The woman from Australia regarded her curiously , then looked back at the man from California . " It ' s been done , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretarial service out of her rooms on one of the upper floors of the hotel and prepared business contracts . " The Chinese have already made a version of it . A Spaniard  --  or maybe he was Italian  --  played Bethune. " // " But that was a Chinese version , right ? " the Californian asked . " When you say ' Sean Connery , ' you ' re talking international version . What could be better for them ? They get their story to the whole world ! " // The Californian , one of our group , had already gotten the travel pieces he would file from the trip . Now he was playing promoter  --  even though he lacked the promoter ' s wild certainty that his schemes would come true . " Will they want script approval ? " he asked // " Of course , " said the Australian woman . " He ' s a very valuable martyr . You think they ' re going to let Hollywood mess it up ? " // " The Chinese want to modernize , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who renewed his visa every 90 days . " You can ' t modernize without foreign exchange. " // The man from California sat back and shook his head. // " What do you think all these people dream about ? " asked the Australian woman , nodding her head toward the tables behind her. // The sidewalk cafe served as the gather- ing place of Peking ' s foreign community . Large groups , almost exclusively men , circled the tables , talking like the Californian of deals they were promoting and obstacles they encountered. **28;6393; v. <> e were in the place because the magazine writer from San Francisco had arranged to meet the broadcaster there . " Oh , it ' s exciting being here ! " she kept saying . She looked out at the tables of foreign residents and kept asking the German businessman , who sat beside her , what their nationalities were. // " Those are the Eastern-bloc boys , " he told her , pointing unobstrusively . " Those are the French. " // " Can ' t you tell ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ve all got those handsome French noses. " // Someone asked the German what would happen in China . He jut shook his head . " How do they modernize their agriculture ? " he asked . " Really , it ' s impossible ! One harvester in one day can do the work of 1 , 000 people . If you put a harvester on a commune , you need a driver . But what do you tell the 999 workers that are replaced ? Go play cards ? There ' s unemployment as it is ! " // " The problem is how to break out of traditional ways , " the German continued . " It ' s so difficult to pay for the machines ! " // The Canadian broadcaster said , " I think China has run out of luck . " But perhaps he was just tired of the loneliness of his life , tired of repeating the same analyses to transients like us. // " people are starving on communes less than 30 miles from here , " the German businessman said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stood in front of the hotel , demanding food. " // The broadcaster mentioned the resentment of students . " In Shanghai , " he said , " I found myself defending Mao to a bunch of 19-and 20-year-olds . They thought he ' d betrayed his own revolution. " // " Wish I ' d seen that , " said the Australian woman. // The food writer from New York had persuaded the broadcaster to rate the best restaurants in Peking . This produced a story for her , and she was feeling good about China . " I ' m rooting for them ! " // " So am I ! " agreed the magazine writer from San Francisco. // ( Of all the places I ' ve visited , I felt I understood China least . Perhaps I did not even really understand what was going on here . Still , it seemed to me that if I could capture the sound and feel of this place at this moment , I would have a word-postcard more meaningful than a photo . It would be a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I caught the talk right , I would remember that it was not important . The important thing was that we were all English-speakers , Western strangers in the East . And for a few minutes we could come together and nourish each other with blarney and putdowns and punditry and so assuage our sense nof not quite fitting in China . And we could then go back out there into it renewed. ) // " I fell such a wonderful humanness and striving among these people . " The magazine writer said . " It ' s exciting ! " // The Australian woman raised a skeptical eyebrow. // " But it is ! It **28;6423; is <> exciting ! " // " What ' s so exciting about it ? " asked the Australian woman. // " Usually the world just goes along , " the woman from San Francisco explained . " But every now and then there ' s a place where things are really happening , where decisions are being made , where the best people are . Right now that ' s this place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , grinning at each of us . " The people in this room are going to change the face of China , " she explained . " That will change the face of Asia  --  and then of the world. " // " Well , well ! " said the Australian woman . She craned her neck and surveyed the tables . " I ' ll have to remind myself of that ! " // " You don ' t change China , " the broadcaster said . " It ' s been here 4 , 000 years ! I ' m not even sure Mao changed it much. " // But the woman from San Frnacisco was not really listening , for she had what she wanted out of China . " I ' ve been wondering what my China story would be , " she said , smiling .
