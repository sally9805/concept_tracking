When the South African Parliament reconvened in Cape Town last week after a two-month recess , the government of State President P.W . Botha was expected to offer a bill to set up a national council of blacks and whites that would advise him on social and political matters . Though the council 's recommendations would not be legally binding , its creation was supposed to be a conciliatory gesture to the country 's 24 million voteless blacks . As it turned out , the government was not ready to offer such a bill , and there was speculation that Botha had decided not to do so until he received private assurances from black leaders that they would be willing to serve on the council . So far , apparently none have agreed to do so . <P> Instead of the goodwill gesture , the government released a list of 8,551 people who have been arrested since the current state of emergency was declared on June 12 . Some critics claimed that the real number of detainees was closer to 12,000 , but the official figure was high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The list , declared the Progressive Federal Party 's Helen Suzman , was a " terrifying indictment of the government 's inability to maintain law-and-order . " <P> In the meantime , following a legal challenge by the country 's leading English-language newspapers , the government conceded that two of its emergency orders concerning the press had been promulgated improperly , and were therefore invalid . One order forbade the press to cover actions of the security forces , and the other banned journalists from black residential areas . The directives were thrown out by the court because the government had failed to announce them in the official gazette or by public proclamation , but had simply dispatched them by telex to the South African Press Association . The government can still put the measures into effect whenever it chooses by following the prescribed procedures . <P> As time passes , the chance of racial compromise seems to be getting slimmer . Scarcely two months ago Western leaders still hoped to persuade Botha to release Black Leader Nelson Mandela , who has been in prison for 24 years . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tutu , the Nobel peace laureate who is due to be installed on Sept. 7 as Archbishop of Cape Town and head of the Anglican Church in southern Africa . Two weeks ago Manpower Minister Pieter du Plessis gave Tutu a " friendly warning " that his calls for sanctions against South Africa " border on high treason . " Last week Andries Treurnicht , head of the far-right Conservative Party , joined the chorus by demanding that Tutu be " dealt with immediately . "
