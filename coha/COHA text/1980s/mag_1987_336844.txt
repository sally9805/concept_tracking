To Claudia Draper ( Barbra Streisand ) , love is felonious assault , and she has the open wounds to prove it . Her mother 's plaintive " I love you " may be a threat or a curse . Her stepfather 's caress may have been foreplay to child abuse . Her ex-husband 's ardor may have sheathed sexual brutality . Indeed , the smothering affections of all people may have driven Claudia nuts . That is why she sits edgily in a New York City courtroom , at a hearing to determine if she is competent to stand trial on a manslaughter charge . Claudia is a $500-an- hour call girl , and her " victim " was an aging john  --  one more man who believed that pain is at the core of love . <P> At its best , Nuts is a picture that has much to say about the corrupting power of possessive love . But as adapted for Streisand by Tom Topor and veteran Screenwriters Darryl Ponicsan and Alvin Sargent , it too often surrenders to the banalities of its genre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm O.K. Because Society Says I 'm Not O.K. " movie . The protagonist is not insane , merely misunderstood by those who impose rules she refuses to play by . Every time an authority figure declares she is incompetent , her sanity is supposed to be affirmed . This is no-risk psychodrama . And no drama as well , because Claudia 's moral superiority is too easy to spot . <P> Ignore this considerable defect , and you can take solemn pleasure in Director Martin Ritt 's familiar craftsmanship . You can enjoy the strong performance by Richard Dreyfuss ( as Claudia 's public and private defender ) . You may even smile at Streisand 's straining to create another movie metaphor for her own fettered Hollywood eminence . Claudia , like Yentl before her , is a smart , sexy woman whose place of respect the boys in power want to deny . Streisand , who has both power and respect , might be advised to use that leverage on a project less conventional and complacent than this very mixed Nuts .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
