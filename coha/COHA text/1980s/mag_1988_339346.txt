May 1980 . With only a few primaries remaining , Ronald Reagan had the Republican nomination sewn up . Yet one challenger , George Bush , doggedly stayed in the race . Bush 's campaign manager and best friend , James Baker , pleaded with him to withdraw . Bush refused . Finally Baker announced at a press conference that Bush was pulling out of the California primary because of lack of funds . Bush , in New Jersey , was shocked when he learned from reporters of Baker 's statement and immediately flew to Houston to confront his campaign manager . The incident came close to ending Bush and Baker 's friendship . But Bush 's retreat ultimately helped him win the vice-presidential spot . It also helped Baker get a top job with Reagan . <P> Eight years later , Baker is philosophical about the ' 80 campaign . " We 've been through 30 years of good times and bad times together , " says Baker of Bush , " and they 've only strengthened the friendship and understanding between us . " <P> James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush has going for him . Since stepping down as Treasury Secretary , Baker , 58 , has played a crucial role in reviving Bush 's once listless campaign with cool efficiency and uncanny political instincts . Baker brought order to a chaotic campaign that had been run by a committee of six senior advisers . " We 're making decisions and sticking with them , " he says . " They may not always be right , but they 're being made . " Yet Baker is no dictator . A tactful Texan , he never fails to seek advice from his lieutenants and listens carefully before making a decision . <P> Though he is a workaholic who puts in 14-hour days at the office , Baker exudes serenity . He is apt to crack jokes at his daily 7:30 a.m. staff meeting and has started a " most outrageous tie " competition , encouraging the driven and serious topsides of the campaign to try to outdo one another in flaunting garish neckwear . <P> Working out of an office two blocks from the White House , Baker commandeers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pins marking the movements of Bush , Dan Quayle , Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen . His desk is a conference table that seats twelve and is stacked with Baker 's ubiquitous " things to do " lists . He makes or takes up to 100 phone calls a day , speaking with Bush about 16 times . His only break comes with a lunch of cottage cheese and tuna with Tabasco sauce . Once an avid ham-and-eggs man , Baker now watches his cholesterol . <P> Like Bush , he is a son of privilege . But the native Texan Baker  --  a man who can look natural wearing an elegant suit while chewing a wad of Red Man tobacco  --  manages to display the image of Eastern polish mixed with Southwestern earthiness that Bush looks silly trying to project . The family law firm , Baker &; Botts , which his great-grandfather joined in 1872 , is one of the largest and most prestigious in Houston . Baker was educated at the Hill ! School in Pennsylvania and at Princeton , earned a law degree at the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-nepotism rules at Baker &; Botts , he practiced corporate law at Andrews &; Kurth.
