Viet Nam attacks rebels , bombs civilians and goads Thailand <P> Each year , when monsoon rains sweep in from the Indian Ocean , three separate guerrilla armies emerge from their sanctuaries to challenge the 180,000 Vietnamese troops who have been occupying Kampuchea since 1979 . And each year , when the parched rice paddies sprout nothing but stubble , the Vietnamese seek revenge , rolling out their tanks in an effort to eliminate the 45,000 armed " nationalists " opposed to the Vietnamese-backed government of President Heng Samrin . But this year the Vietnamese have instigated something more than the usual rite of spring . In their most deadly and deliberate offensive yet , they have been training their guns not only on the insurgents but on unarmed civilians and even on neighboring Thailand . <P> The latest Vietnamese assault has forced 45,000 Kampuchean civilians who live in camps along the 450-mile border with Thailand to flee across the frontier ; according to some reports , 90 people have been killed and 300 wounded . Said State Department Spokesman Alan Romberg : " We are appalled that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The U.S. has already sent an emergency grant of $1.5 million to the Red Cross , and last week it announced that it would immediately begin airlifting into Thailand a number of Redeye antiaircraft missiles , followed by new 155-mm extended-range howitzers . <P> The Vietnamese apparently plan to obliterate the main camps of each of the three resistance groups in turn . Two weeks ago they demolished Phnom Chat , a border settlement loyal to the Khmer Rouge , the largest of the insurgent groups . Three days later , and 70 miles to the northeast , they leveled O Samach , which is also known as Sihanoukville for its 30,000 followers of Prince Norodom Sihanouk , who was deposed in 1970 . The next Vietnamese target will probably be the camps of Ban Sangae and Nong Samet , which house 96,000 civilians and serve as a center for the Khmer People 's National Liberation Front . That group is led by Son Sann , 71 , who is perhaps Kampuchea 's least-tarnished and therefore ( to the Vietnamese ) most threatening nationalist leader . <P> At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Thai territory , directing artillery fire at Thai villages and shelling a highway . The Thais angrily responded by sending F-5E fighter planes to dislodge Vietnamese soldiers and by dispatching a note of protest to the United Nations , charging the Vietnamese with " unprovoked and blatant acts of aggression . " In Bangkok , the ambassadors of Viet Nam and the Soviet Union , which supports Viet Nam , were summoned to the foreign ministry for a stern lecture .
