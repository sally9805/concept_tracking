 | It wasas the complaint of a master dissembler , a note repeatedly struck whenever Peter Sellers talked about himself : the actor had vanished into his role . Yet he was a stranger only to himself . To millions of movie fans who roared at his prolific gallery of comic characters , Sellers was unmistakable and inimitable , a fount of mirth in any guise . By the time of his death last week , after suffering his third major heart attack at 54 , the great impersonator had proven himself the most versatile comic actor of his generation . Sellers 's sudden emergence in 1959 in ' The Mouse that Roared " and " I 'm All Right , Jack , " established him as a pivotal figure in British comedy . His three roles in " Mouse " evoked comparison with Alec Guinness in " Kind Hearts and Coronets " and the vintage English comedies of the ' 40s and ' 50s . The rigidly leftist labor leader he played in " I 'm All Right , Jack " showed a subtler side to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's zanily irreverent " Goon Show " * presaged the antiestablishment comedy of the ' 60s . The absurdist humor later popularized by director Richard Lester and Monty Python 's Flying Circus is foretold in a classic short that Sellers and the Goon squad made in 1959 called " The Running , Jumping and Standing Still Film . " Sellers made more than 50 films , and frequently his vehicles were unworthy of his talent . In such forgettable efforts as " Undercovers Hero " and " The Bobo , " his virtuosity is spinning in a void . Only under the direction of Stanley Kubrick and Blake Edwards did Sellers 's talent blossom into comic immortality . In his tripartite stardom in Kubrick 's " Dr. Strangelove , " Sellers sent up Wernher von Braun as the eponymous mad scientist , spoofed Stevensonian liberals as U.S. President Merkin Muffley and paid homage to Alec Guinness as the unflappable British Group Captain Mandrake . Perhaps his most brilliant and original performance was as the lascivious , oft-disguised playwright Clare Quilty in Kubrick 's earlier " Lolita . " Masquerading as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mason 's Humbert Humbert with a monologue of Nabokovian innuendo that is one of the most unnervingly funny set-pieces in movie history . Slapstick : But it was as the imperturbable Gallic schlemiel , Inspector Clouseau , in Edwards 's five " Pink Panther " movies that Sellers won his greatest following . Nonchalantly leaning against a spinning globe that in turn spun him out of the room , he proved a rival of great silent clowns in physical slapstick , and he fractured the language ( rheeum for room , beump for bump ) with the most hilariously unlikely accent of his myriad-voiced career . Clouseau made Sellers a millionaire , but he came to feel constricted by the character . It was the tricky role of Chauncey Gardiner in last year 's " Being There " that brought him back into the critical limelight . Chauncey was obviously a creature close to Sellers 's heart , a chameleon whose personality is totally formed by the mediadrenched environment . There was a ghostly pathos in Sellers 's affectless portrayal , a tinge of melancholy that was an essential part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actor , called " Will the Real Peter Sellers ... ?

Superstitions : Half Jewish ( on his mother 's side ) , half Protestant , Sellers was the son of variety-show troupers , spending much of his childhood in theatrical boarding houses . His mother coached him and nursed his ambition : after she died in 1967 he said he remained in psychic communication with her , consulting her for advice . In his stardom , he became an eccentric , often controversial figure , shy and reclusive in private , whose love affairs and four marriages nonetheless made him a staple of the scandal sheets . On the set , his perfectionism and superstitions earned him a reputation for difficulty ? no one , for example , was allowed to wear green or purple ( " the color of death " ) in his presence .

He kept his distance at his home in Gstaad , Switzerland , but the compulsion to work continually drew him back to the movie set . Though doctors warned him that his weak heart required rest , Sellers could never slow down . For his last movie , " The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu , " he not only played multiple characters but took over the direction of the film . " I ca n't do anything from within myself , " Sellers once said . " I have nothing to project . I 've got so many inhibitions that I sometimes wonder whether I exist at all . " These are not the words of a clown hiding behind his masks , but of a man who only found himself in his masks .
