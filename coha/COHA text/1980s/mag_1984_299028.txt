THE BASILEUS QUARTET Directed and Written by Fabio Carpi <P> Harmony is the wan hope of age , the last dream to which it may reasonably aspire . Virtuosity is callow youth 's callous expectation , the ambition toward which its bursting energy and blustering strength heedlessly compel it . That is why , dearly as they may love their offspring , parents of prodigies are so happy to see them off to college and career . May they achieve their hearts ' desires - but please , God , on their own time . <P> This being so , imagine the consternation of a distinguished chamber ensemble , rich in years and adoring reviews , when their first violinist is felled by a heart attack . Their alternative is retirement or filling the empty chair . Brief experience with the former is not encouraging . After years of letting the group set their tones and rhythms , the remaining bachelors find their loneliness difficult . And without the calming core with which music provided their lives , they are restive . The appearance of Edoardo Morelli ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a superb musician . He is a handsome and energizing presence on the stage and in their lives . He can find women , pot or a high-stakes poker game wherever they go . He reminds them all of their lost youths and awakens their unused parental instincts at the moment when most people are gratefully abandoning them . Eventually , without malice , with quiet but unfailing good cheer , he will destroy them all . <P> The first to fall is Guglielmo ( Michel Vitold ) . A repressed homosexual ( and , more significantly , a repressed romantic ) , he can not hold his true nature back when Edo , as he renames their prodigy , appears . What drives him mad is not open acknowledgment of his secret , but the boy 's indifference to it . What 's all the fuss , Edo sleepily wonders , about the central issue of his would-be mentor 's life . The next to go is Diego ( Omero Antonutti ) . Encouraged by youth 's unconscious example , he vainly seeks to reclaim the woman he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy might be moved by Diego 's plight , but just at the moment he is involved with a girl revolutionary he smuggled across the Austro-Italian border . Alvaro ( Hector Alterio ) , his sexuality dampened by illness , his ego padded by wry self-awareness , endures , but only as accompanist to the boy when he sets forth on a soloist 's career , still blithely unaware of the damage he has done . <P> Nor should he be . In Fabio Carpi 's unsentimental , indeed comic view of what would usually be presented as dark doings , youth need not apologize for its selfishness . And age has no choice but to accept it with whatever rue and wit experience has granted it . <P> Visually unexceptional , narratively straightforward , Carpi 's film is neverthe-less intricately worked out psychologically . It plays like a lovely chamber piece , and its actors work with a good musical quartet 's instinctive politesse and self-effacing skill , muting individual flights in deference to total effect . Carpi may never be a Beethoven of the cinema , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough of those making movies these days .
