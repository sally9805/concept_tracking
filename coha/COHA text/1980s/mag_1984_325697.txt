Two surveys of black privation <P> At first glance it certainly looked like a great year for American blacks . Staring out from newsstands for much of the year were three compelling examples of how far they had come in 1983 : Vanessa Williams , the first black Miss America ; Guion Bluford Jr. , the first black American astronaut in space ; and , of course , Presidential Candidate Jesse Jackson . <P> However , according to the National Urban League 's annual survey , " The State of Black America , " released last week , these were the exceptions in a year otherwise notable for its stunning lack of progress for most of the country 's 28 million blacks . Declared Urban League President John E. Jacob : " Black America is in desperate straits . " <P> The Urban League 's statistical portrait was one of intractable joblessness and poverty , even in the face of a robust national recovery . In December , the national unemployment rate fell to 8.2% , the lowest in more than two years . But for blacks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the unemployment rate was a dispiriting 17.8% . <P> Almost half of all black teen-agers who wanted to work were unable to find a job . <P> Moreover , the percentage of black families at or below the Government 's official poverty line - $9,862 for a family of four-was almost three times that of whites , the worst rate since 1967 . Half of all black children live in families with incomes below the poverty line . Black America , Jacob said , remains " buried in a depression of crushing proportions . " <P> Economic burdens were particularly heavy in the black households headed by women , 42% of the total . <P> More than half of these women lacked a high school diploma ; three-fifths did not have jobs . The poverty rate for these female-headed black families : a worrisome 45% . <P> The Urban League 's bleak findings were bolstered by another report released the same day that dealt with job discrimination . In a survey of major companies in the Boston area , the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ) found blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally better educated in Boston than in most other areas of the U.S. , they are disproportionately concentrated in lower-paying jobs . Not one of Boston 's electric , gas and sanitary-service companies has minority sales employees . <P> Even custodian jobs in investment firms are , according to the EEOC , " totally segregated . " Fumed Regional Director Thomas Saltonstall : " This is n't Baton Rouge in 1864 . It is Boston in 1984 . The situation is appalling . "
