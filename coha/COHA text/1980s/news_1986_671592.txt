Augusto Pinochet , " but they want , above all , to avoid a split within the institution. // " So they want to try to convince Pinochet to make his own decision to step aside , " he said . " The problem is that no one in the army is capable of saying that to Pinochet. " #1989 Vote for Single Candidate As now contemplated under the 1980 Constitution , the voting scheduled for January or early February 1989 would approve or reject a single candidate proposed by the four military commanders . That candidate could be General Pinochet , who is commander in chief of the army as well as President . He would serve an eight-year term and step aside in 1997 for a freely elected president . A congress would be freely elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require revising the Constitution , which was written by Pinochet supporters . Many changes proposed would have to be submitted to a plebiscite , a process that would take at least a year , according to experts on Chile ' s constitutional and legal traditions. // Political opponents take the position that 1989 is too long to wait for a democratic transition . But General Pinochet has rebuffed demands for talks on the issue and has thus far emerged unshaken from recurrent demonstrations , work stoppages and a surge of violence by a small leftist guerrilla force over the last three years. // The United States , despite the Reagan Administration ' s recent shift to public criticism of the Pinochet Government , has indicated that it accepts the 1989 schedule as the earliest time a change will be possible , barring unexpected events , according to Administration officials . They said it had come to see the military leadership around and immediately below General Pinochet as the key to accomplishing this . <> <> Intermediate Steps Urged // Ambassador Harry G. Barnes Jr. is focusing his efforts on showing United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties , reducing human rights abuses and ending restrictions on the press . At the same time , American officials would like to convince the largest opposition front to support a presidential candidate acceptable to the armed forces. // The final part of the United States policy equation , according to officials in Washington , is based on the hope that Pentagon officials can convince senior Chilean Army generals of the need to persuade General Pinochet to make plans for giving up power. // Only slight indications of a military willingness to allow open elections in 1989 have come to light . For example , the navy and air force commanders , Adm . Jose Toribio Merino and Gen. Fernando Matthei , have said they are willing to consider revisions in the Constitution , which is taken to mean changes in the 1989 vote plans . <> <> Plans to Export Kiwi Fruit // General Matthei was also thought to be sending a message related to the transition question when he declared recently that he planned to become an exporter of kiwi fruit in 1989 . The present Constitution would allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who want a peaceful change hope to appeal to what they regard as the traditions of the Chilean armed forces . The Chilean military ' s philosophy has been that it should intervene in politics only when constitutional order appears threatened. // Despite the hundreds of people killed in the aftermath of the 1973 coup and the arbitrary detention , torture and occasional unexplained killings that have occurred since then , most of the Chilean opposition still speaks of the military with some regard. // " There is no anti-institutional attitude here against the armed forces as happened in Argentina , " said Gabriel Valdes , a former foreign minister who is president of the Christian Democrats , the largest political party here . <> <> Fear of Disorder Seen // He said the majority of Chileans wanted to avoid " disorder , inflation and social tension " such as occurred under the Marxist-dominated Government of President Salvador Allende Gossens from 1970 to 1973 , as well as the " system of repression , torture and exile " that followed. // Armando Jaramillo Lyon , who leads the small Republican Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven-party Democratic Alliance , said : " We have to conduct the democratization together with the army . But the army is very frugal about talking. " // As politicians and military experts point out , the traditions of the Chilean military make it unlikely that it will succumb easily to pressures from either the political opposition or the United States. // The army ' s policy , according to military experts , is one of unquestioning acceptance of a strict , vertical command . This , together with its tradition of not taking sides in political questions , has made it difficult for the army , once in power , to take up the issue of how to withdraw , unless the order comes from General Pinochet . <> <> Reshuffled Upper Ranks // The general recently reshuffled the upper ranks of the army in what was seen as an effort to insure the loyalty of those around him .

Gustavo Leigh Guzman , a air force commander who was removed from the junta by General Pinochet in 1978 after he publicly criticized the slow pace of democratization , said General Pinochet , who is 70 years old , has gradually retired generals closest to him in age and seniority , those who might be more inclined to demonstrate independence . General Sinclair , he said , is 10 years behind General Pinochet in seniority. // " That creates a certain docility , " General Leigh said . Several Envoys Have Failed Washington officials said their decision to look to the Chilean Army to promote change was a result of the failure of a succession of high-level civilian envoys since 1981 - including Jeane J. Kirkpatrick and two assistant secretaries of state - to accomplish anything significant. // A State Department official who deals with Chile said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Chile " to make their case to Pinochet that we would like to be helpful but that he has to straighten things out and start a serious democratic transition. " // " No one believes any longer that going down there and making a rational argument will have any effect , " the official added . <> <> Pleased by General ' s Visit // American officials were pleased , however , when the Army Chief of Staff , Gen. John A. Wickham Jr. , visited here last November and was warmly received by General Pinochet. // " He was the first visitor whom Pinochet did not lecture to , " said a Pentagon official in Washington. //
