Relieving rheumatoid arthritis <P> For Adele Lojko , 59 , the eight steps leading from the sidewalk to the front door of her suburban Boston home were a barrier as forbidding as the Great Wall of China . Often confined to a wheelchair with severe rheumatoid arthritis , she had to be carried up and down the steps . But now , after many years of needing assistance whenever she came or left , Mrs. Lojko proudly navigates that once insurmountable hurdle by herself , needing only a cane . <P> Mrs. Lojko is one of ten Boston and eleven San Francisco-area rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with a new program of radiation therapy that has produced promising results in relieving both pain and stiffness from this sometimes crippling disease . Radiation therapy is one of the standard treatments for Hodgkin 's disease and other cancers of the lymph nodes ; in the past 25 years , it has helped raise the cure rate for Hodgkin 's disease from 30% to 80% . While refining their techniques , Hodgkin 's researchers noticed that irradiation also seemed to relieve arthritis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaplan , 63 , one of the pioneers in Hodgkin 's treatment , then devised a similar therapy for rheumatoid arthritis victims who had failed to respond to conventional treatment , which included use of cytotoxic ( cell damaging ) and anti-inflammatory drugs . <P> Using a high-energy X-ray beam , researchers at Stanford administered a total of 2,000 rads of radiation ( less than half the dosage for Hodgkin 's disease ) to the lymph nodes of the neck , chest , abdomen , thymus gland and spleen . Patients were treated five days a week for five weeks . Within a month , all the patients started to improve ; six months after the irradiation , disagreeable symptoms such as morning stiffness , pain and swelling within the joints were all significantly reduced . <P> Researchers at Harvard used a larger radiation dose ( 3,000 rads ) , but the radiation was administered at intervals : three weeks of treatment would be followed by two weeks of rest over a four-month period . While the symptoms were relieved for up to a year , the results were not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaps between treatments . Harvard Radiation Therapist James A. Belli , 50 , says patients ' response depends on how far their disease has advanced . " If the joints have not been structurally altered , " says he , " the pain is almost completely eliminated . " Side effects were transient and similar to those experienced by Hodgkin 's patients : fatigue , sore throat and occasional diarrhea . <P> Rheumatoid arthritis is one of many autoimmune diseases , in which the body 's immune system attacks its own tissues . In rheumatoid arthritis , the body responds as if the joints were a foreign element , using different types of white blood cells to attack and destroy the supposed invader . Though researchers still hope to develop drugs that control the body 's immune system , radiotherapy may provide interim relief for some of the nearly 6.5 million Americans suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. -
