Valentine 's Day has always sent lovebirds flocking to the florist . Right after Cupid 's departure , though , flower sales used to shrivel up . No longer . Flowers , once an ornament reserved for special occasions , have become a year- round staple on many shopping lists . Now , no better reason for buying a bouquet is needed than that the sun is shining , or that the sun is not shining . Sandy Taylor , owner of Plaza Florist &; Gifts in Urbandale , Iowa , has noticed the trend . Says she : " Lots of people buy flowers on the way home from work . When we sign the card we ask , ' For what occasion ? ' They say , ' No occasion . ' " <P> Business has blossomed for dealers in floral products in recent years . U.S. retail sales of cut flowers have increased from $2.9 billion in 1981 to $3.7 billion in 1985 . Revenues for FTD , the long-distance delivery network , have been growing by more than 10% annually , reaching $551 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no more of an extravagance than buying a loaf of bread . John Culbreth , who works in Atlanta 's bureau of recreation , picks up some fresh-cut varieties while he does his shopping at the DeKalb County farmers ' market . Says he : " I do n't know the names of what I 'm buying . I just know how they look . " People are buying flowers to decorate their homes , brighten up their offices or cheer up pals . Michael Goldberg , a Chicago financial analyst , sent flowers to a college friend who had failed a test . <P> One reason flowers are selling fast is that they are now available in so many places besides traditional florist shops . They are sprouting in grocery stores , in malls , on street corners . The Cincinnati-based Kroger chain has put flower sections in almost 60% of its 1,351 supermarkets . At the Apache mall in Rochester , Minn. , Bachman 's , a prominent Minnesota florist , runs a row of well-stocked kiosks called the European Flower Markets , where customers can shop without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York and other cities , traffic-dodging vendors hawk $2 bunches to motorists who are willing to roll down their windows . <P> This wide availability triggers impulse buying . Says Flor Deleo , president of the Miami Flower Exchange : " You walk into a supermarket , see the flowers , and they 're attractive and inexpensive . You grab a bottle of wine for $2.99 . What 's $2.99 more for a nice bouquet of flowers ? " Trying to cash in on impulse purchases , 7-Eleven convenience stores in South Florida sell single long-stemmed roses alongside the soft drinks and beer . <P> The growth in the number of customers who buy flowers frequently has given rise to a new type of store . So-called stem or bucket shops let the buyer be the florist . Each fresh-cut variety is put in a vase , and customers are left to create their own arrangements . Florist Gwen Moore has opened two bucket shops called the Blossom Broker in suburban Denver . Says she : " People can walk right into the cooler and do their own thing .
