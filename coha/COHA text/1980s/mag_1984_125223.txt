Trailing the Washington Federals 16-13 with 4:06 left to play last Saturday , the Oklahoma Outlaws took over at their own seven-yard line . Oklahoma 's 5-2 record had been built on blind faith , acts of God and Doug Williams , and they were fresh out of acts of God . Rain had fallen intermittently on RFK Stadium ( each Oklahoma win had come in the rain , the great equalizer for the Outlaws , who are n't talent rich or even talent middle-class ) , but now it had stopped . Ninety-three yards later , though , Doug Williams sufficed . The Outlaws won 20-16 on an eight-yard Williams touchdown pass with : 57 left and now stand at 6-2 , the best expansion-team record in the USFL . Considering the circumstances , Oklahoma coach Woody Widenhofer should be up for governor and Williams in line for sainthood  --  as in St. Jude , patron of lost causes  --  because the Outlaws are n't so much a team as a miracle . // The first play of that final drive was a short pass to running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ball hit his hands and forearms , spun off , then glanced up into his eyes as he groped for it in vain . It must have been upsetting to watch it flutter away again . Yet Widenhofer clapped as if to say , do n't worry , you 'll get the next one . This was only the latest headache for the coach , a bearish , 41-year-old workman who sports a droopy mustache and has Pittsburgh written all over him . // On New Year 's Day , Widenhofer was still the defensive coordinator and assistant head coach for the Steelers , for whom he 'd worked through 11 seasons and four Super Bowls . That afternoon the Steelers had been embarrassed by the Raiders in the NFL playoffs , and Widenhofer had just returned home from L.A. and gone to sleep when the phone rang . On the line was the **26;581;TOOLONG manager of the Outlaws . " Woody , this is Bill Tatham , Junior . " // " Huhwahhuhwah , " mumbled a befogged Widenhofer into the phone . // " Woody , how 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outlaws ? " // " Oklahoma who ? " said Widenhofer . " I thought it was a crank call , " he says now . // " I told him he had 48 hours to decide , " says Tatham with a grin . // The 29-year-old Tatham seems to revel in issuing ultimatums . The Outlaws play at the University of Tulsa 's Skelly Stadium , where they 've averaged 19,802 in attendance for five home dates . Capacity at Skelly is 40,235 , and it has no more parking than you 'd find at a Broadway theater . " We will play in a major league facility , " Tatham says , " somewhere . We 've talked to five other cities . There has been a feasibility study done for a domed stadium in North Tulsa , but we want a commitment . By June . At the latest . Our Number One priority is to survive . Our Number Two priority is to stay in Oklahoma . " // Tatham 's grandparents had much the same view in 1934 when they left Sallisaw , Okla. for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months pregnant with his father , Bill Sr. , who was to make a few timely investments around Fresno . Bill Sr. owned the Portland Thunder in the World Football League . That was n't a timely investment . Nevertheless , last May he bought a USFL franchise , which he planned to locate in San Diego until he found he could n't get a stadium lease . This time Bill Jr . was old enough to take over the reins , and he pulled hard . // The Outlaws ' general manager was Sid Gillman , the 72-year-old Obi-wan Kenobi of such NFL brains as Al Davis and Bill Walsh . Gillman gathered some 150 players for the Outlaws ' training camp , and he thought he had Jerry Rhome , the Washington Redskins ' quarterback coach and a former Tulsa All-America quarterback , as his head coach . // Tatham Jr . fired Gillman in December . " We had different ideas as to which direction we were going , " Tatham says . The bottom line was that Williams , with a five-year , $3 million contract , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oklahoma has the second-lowest payroll in the USFL : $2.1 million . Gillman had wanted looser purse strings . He now calls Tatham " The Boy Wonder . " Says Tatham , " I like Sid . Really . But it was the golden rule  --  the guy with the gold makes the rules . " // Tatham boasts that the Outlaws " were within 10 minutes of signing " the San Diego Chargers ' Dan Fouts . But , luckily , that is not what happened . Fouts is a quarterback who depends on precision play by his teammates . Williams , who learned the ropes with the struggling Tampa Bay Bucs , knew how to ad-lib . With Gillman out , Rhome thought he would be in control . " But we just wanted a man to coach the players on the field , " says Tatham . So Rhome stayed in Washington . Enter Widenhofer , just 11 days before the Jan. 15 start of training camp . // Widenhofer knows defensive football and he loves character . There 's a lot of it in linebacker Terry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anderson , who help fill the inside lanes in the Outlaws ' sturdy 3-4 . And the Outlaws have defensive backs worthy of the name . They lead the league with 19 interceptions . The best of the secondary is free safety Kelvin Middleton , a rookie from Wichita State . Middleton intercepted two passes and knocked Federals quarterback Mike Hohensee out , and out of Saturday 's game , with a smashing tackle on a blitz in the second half . " The defense just tries to give Doug a chance to win the game , " says Middleton . // The Outlaws have won four times on their last possession in a game . Houston led Oklahoma 28-20 with four seconds left and the Outlaws at midfield before a Williams Hail Mary found Alphonso Williams six yards deep in the end zone . Normally flawless Michigan turned the ball over eight times in a driving rainstorm and lost to the Outlaws 20-17 . On the other hand , in ideal weather the Outlaws were strung up by the Arizona Wranglers 49-7. // The rain held off until after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a 17-14 overtime loss to the Denver Gold . Oklahoma had recently signed punter Bob Boris , who had won a court case against the USFL and its underclassman ineligibility rule . Boris promptly lost the Denver game , dropping two center snaps inside the Outlaws ' 10-yard line . Later , he was asked if he felt like Curt Flood ( the plaintiff in the landmark 1972 baseball free-agency case ) and therefore had been nervous in the game . Boris said , " Who 's Curt Flood ? " Did n't Boris know ? " I do n't know and I do n't care , " he said . Three days later , Boris was gone . // That Oklahoma was down 16-6 to the winless , woebegone Federals in the fourth quarter was n't anything to write home about , either . But , as Williams says , " I learned it 's not how you play the game  --  it 's who wins . " He completed 24 of 45 passes  --  seven were dropped  --  for 333 yards and two touchdowns. // " The players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's nothing new , but here they even ask me about personal matters . I 'm only 28 years old , but I look around and see how much I 've grown . Next year , when we get some more players in here .... " Like maybe Tulsa resident and NFL All-Pro receiver Steve Largent , who does the Outlaws ' color for KJRH-TV . His Seattle contract is up next year . For now , Mel Gray , 35 and nursing a bad hamstring , and A. Williams , 22 and out of Nevada-Reno , who caught a 43-yard scoring strike Saturday , are Oklahoma 's deep threats . " You can only be as good as those around you , " says D. Williams . // The best of his six completions in the final drive was a third-and-seven 19-yarder to fullback Sidney Thornton , the third option , to Washington 's 25 . On the previous down , Federals linebacker Mike Muller had dropped an interception , and Williams had looked toward Heaven . The winning touchdown pass was a sideline throw to tight end Ron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit Wheeler right on the money . // Williams was a .500 quarterback ( 33-31-1 ) in five years with Tampa Bay . Without him , the Buccaneers are 5-47 lifetime , so Williams was a .500 quarterback for a .100 team . He has improved and is now a .750 quarterback for a .250 team . No quarterback can keep up that pace . The Oklahoma Outlaws are a good bet to come back to earth unless , of course , Williams keeps getting help from way upstairs , rain or shine .
