Although in college she concentrated on piano , art history , Latin , and French , and at 25 won a national playwriting award , at 35 in Guatemala she was collecting boxes of insects for Chicago ' s Field Museum . In my parents ' sojourns in the Philippines , France , Japan , Cyprus , Lebanon , Portugal , Spain , Thailand , Nigeria , the Virgin Islands , less exotic Chicago , Philadelphia , New York , Washington , and finally Coconut Grove , although they were not scientists , they had ample opportunity for entomological investigations . Yet I don ' t remember complaints about bugs. // // Frankly , I find mosquitoes and flies merely annoying but wasps terrifying , though last spring , moving into a ramshackle farmhouse which wasps inhabited before we did , I learned a limited laissez faire . Still , I grew up regarding insects with curiosity . And I get lost in insect books with all the Latin monikers and homier common names - aquatic puyralid moth , pale-legged tree-fungus beetle , two-tooth longhorn , constricted flowerbug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sharp editor would have bluepenciled the surfeit of adjectives. // Only at 28 did I meet cockroaches I remember . We had just moved to Washington . At a dinner party in historic Georgetown , our host with a grand gesture lighted the candles on the table , and lo , the walls danced an avant-garde ballet of jointed legs and graceful antennae. // ' ' The best houses in Georgetown , ' ' said my mother , ' ' have roaches. ' ' // Or , as poet Elizabeth Follin-Jones updated it , ' ' The best roaches have houses in Georgetown. ' ' // Farther out in Cleveland Park , we entertained May beetles , June bugs , ants in July , yellow jackets in August , crickets in September . Sometimes too many . But no roaches. // Meanwhile , my own children were developing their interests in insects . . . At 6 , Alexander brought me a miniature tyrannosaurus which explored his fingers , probosis crooked , gray armor crenelated , arched , and spiked , its el-bows/knees right angles as it stepped up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crept up my pencil tip , antennae waved at me , while cycles of unfinished work - larvae , pupae , wet-winged thoughts - buzzed , gestated on my desk . But I thanked him for his fine assassin bug , insect-sat it for an hour , only later read that they can sting . This didn ' t. . . // A fortnight in an unfinished and unscreened house on St. Thomas , where every evening the extensive collection of moths on the ceilings was different and always amazing , almost prepared me for Malaysia. // There are 200 species of dragonflies in the Malay Peninsula , my 1956 encyclopedia informed me , at least 900 species of lepidoptera , and insects ' ' diverse beyond computation , and many groups are imperfectly known. ' ' // I computed and knew , however imperfectly , many in the course of 362 humid days and nights scented with jasmine , curry , and fish in the east coast village of Sungai Karang ( meaning ' ' river of shells ' ' ) . Little house lizards called chi-cheks were kept busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped in the back door . ( The rooster , auburn and bronze , stalked through the front door , followed by a black hen which frequently laid a speckled egg on my pillow . ) The iridescent emerald beetles were surely too huge for chickens or lizards , as were the brown millipedes ( disconcerting but harmless ) and the red centipedes ( deservedly infamous ) which scuttled under the inch-high crack between doors and floors. // While interesting to observe , neither insects nor chickens fulfilled me emotionally . I loved Malaysia , yet it also marks a frequently lonely period in my life , especially until I learned to communicate in Malay , and until I met other writers . We had no phone , and though the village postman would steam up on his red motorcycle with letters from my favorite editor , otherwise mail seemed to cross the Pacific by sea turtle and the jungles by rhinocerous hornbill. . . // But exciting trips compensated for occasional loneliness . The jungle clearing where I went camping with Alex-ander , then 13 , and Wan , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and large Cecropia-like moths came to our candles . At dawn we found prints of a tiger . Dawn also brought hordes of fat , furry wasps with orange cummerbunds . Each day more of them swarmed to our sunlit clearing and mistook the flowers on my sarong for real . Quickly switching to plain beige clothes , I fled to the shady trails wasps ignored. // But I don ' t remember one cockroach . Until Penang. // Alexander and I traveled all day by rickety intercity taxi from Sungai Karang west across the Malay Peninsula , north by overnight train , by ferry west to the island of Penang , and by pedicab in all directions until we found a $2-a-night hotel . The room was large and airy , with two clean beds and a welcome overhead fan . Washroom was across the wide central hall . The hall had a table and two chairs . After a day of exploring the island , inhabited mostly by Chinese Malaysians , and a supper of sea cucumbers , shark fins , and noodles , Alexander - a wonderful traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple and lane and trail - soon fell asleep . The other hotel guests also turned in early . I sat at that bare hall table half the night writing. // But I was not alone for long. // The cockroach hovered like a lend-lease dirigible , five inches long plus extensive feelers , then slowly walked down the wall and onto the other chair . All evening it sat ( or stood ) beside me , six feet ( or hands ) poised to scurry elsewhere . Since its species predated vertebrates and would outlive man , I could not repudiate its right to a seven-inch span of space , shared time , and the fire of the kerosene lamp. // Furthermore , I admired its ability to decamp : When threatened , run , survive in the crack , be patient , hide from the searchlight of sun , later resume your station. // As it did the following nights as well , keeping me under observation , or merely keeping me company .
