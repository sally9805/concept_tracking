' ' Because China is developing , Hong Kong will be for Asia the entry into China , ' ' predicts the director and chief manager of the Bank of East Asia . ' ' There is no other major financial center on the ( Asian ) continent. ' ' // Mr. Li is also vice-chairman of the 59-member Drafting Committee of the Basic Law determining Hong Kong ' s future . He says , ' ' I can tell you that China is very sincere in its commitment to Hong Kong and to accommodate Hong Kong people . . . . China needs so much capital . It needs Hong Kong. ' ' // // It is , of course , in the interest of a banker ( and , most probably , a man who will be a leader of the future Chinese city of Hong Kong ) to spread the news of Peking ' s accommodativeness . For , at the moment , most observers here agree , it would take only one word - spoken carelessly , negatively , and by a high-level official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankers and businessmen say about the financial atmosphere in this colorful jewel of a city as it enters the twilight of 150 years of British rule . They are cautiously optimistic , however , that Peking is now showing abundant good faith and backing up that faith with financial commitments in Hong Kong . <> <> The 1997 factor overshadows all // ' ' Things are very calm now , although there are still uncertainties with the PRC ( the People ' s Republic of China ) , ' ' says Peter Wrangham , general manager of the gigantic Hong Kong &; Shanghai Bank - the private bank that actually issues most of the currency for this curious economic entity. // Almost all banking , investing , construction , and commerce in Hong Kong is defined by one word : 1997. // That is the year that China replaces Britain as ruler of this haven of laissez faire capitalism. // Chinese leaders have said repeatedly that they will honor their agreement to leave Hong Kong ' s economy untouched for 50 years beyond ' 97 . But , skeptics wonder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communist central planners to want to ' ' direct ' ' the economy ? // It is not clear that there is enough confidence in the future for developers to invest today in , say , a new high-rise office complex , knowing that the leases will go past 1997 and it may take that long or longer for a decent payback. // Putting to rest such questions is what was behind British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ' s expeditious negotiations and agreement with China in 1984 on the future of Hong Kong . For at that time the Hong Kong property market was collapsing , confidence was eroding , the Hong Kong dollar was deteriorating , and inflation was soaring - all because of mounting uncertainties over 1997. // After the Sino-British agreement , and after the Hong Kong dollar was pegged to the United States dollar , confidence began to return. // What has kept the investment and business climate relatively stable since then , bankers and businessmen here say , has been Peking ' s confidence-building measures , along with Peking ' s apparent realization that casual statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good-faith gestures is one big reason for all the ceremony attached to Chinese Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang ' s visit to Britain last week . It is a way of showing that the two powers that signed the accords on Hong Kong ' s future are improving their relations and thus ensuring a smooth transition . <> <> Why China and Hong Kong need each other // ' ' China represents opportunity , ' ' says Verne McKay , general manager for Asia-Pacific of the Royal Bank of Canada . ' ' But those who think Hong Kong will continue as it is are betting one way . Those who do not are betting the other way . Whoever calls it right is going to win a lot of money. ' ' // Mr. McKay ' s own prediction is that ' ' by 2007 , Hong Kong will be the economic center of China. ' ' // Mr. Wrangham of the Hong Kong &; Shanghai Bank says that ' ' people feel they have to have a reasonable presence here to reach the China market. ' ' // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bank of East Asia sees the situation this way : China needs investment capital , which flows into Hong Kong mostly from the overseas Chinese communities in Indonesia , Singapore , Thailand , and Malaysia. // China ' s need for Hong Kong is based firmly on past experience . One of the main reasons that China allowed Hong Kong to remain a capitalistic entrepot after the 1949 communist takeover is that it served as China ' s almost exclusive source of foreign exchange and vitally needed goods for the mainland. // For years , Hong Kong has been China ' s top export market , and the $2 billion-plus trade surplus that China has been running with Hong Kong provides an estimated one-third of China ' s annual foreign-exchange earnings . Li notes , moreover , that some 60 percent of foreign direct investment in China in recent years has come from Hong Kong. // In the post-1949 era , the saying went , if China had wanted to take Hong Kong it could have done so with a telephone call. // At present China maintains 14 banks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has in recent years stepped in and bailed out several Hong Kong business enterprises and investment banks . And Li says the head of the Bank of China has indicated that its ' ' sister banks may go public ' ' soon. // All of these , he notes , are good signs . <> <> The jitters persist // Not wanting to disrupt the flow of money into Hong Kong , says Mr. Li , Peking is unlikely to do anything to alter Hong Kong ' s economic ground rules . He notes that ' ' if they don ' t treat the Hong Kong Chinese well , it will be a bad face problem. ' ' // Hong Kong , say Li and almost everyone else , is the test case for Taiwan . If China cracks down , Taiwan will remain aloof ; if China takes a live-and-let-live attitude , then Taiwan may be encouraged to begin reunification talks. // Assuming capitalism is allowed to flourish , there are benefits to Hong Kong in the merger with China , too . In 1984 China surpassed Britain and West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Li notes that ' ' during these days when protectionism is a rising threat to our export sector , the importance of China as a major export market is increasingly vital. ' ' // Charles Sin , vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange , says he believes that ' ' China is doing its utmost . It is putting its money where its mouth is . I feel the Chinese are 100 percent genuine in trying to maintain the status quo in Hong Kong . . . . Not only will they wait until 1997 , but there will be no changes for another 50 years . That is as long as anybody can guarantee anything. ' ' // So why are there still qualms ? When the Hong Kong-based Far East Economic Review ran a cover story saying Hong Kong ' 86 is a ' ' jittery city , ' ' many business leaders were upset. // ' ' It was not helpful , and it was not true , ' ' says banker Wrangham. // ' ' Foreign interests , ' ' points out Eric Nickerson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' are confident about what is happening in the PRC . The biggest concern is on the local level. ' ' // Foreign investment , however , is only 10 percent of the Hong Kong economy , Mr. Nickerson notes . <> <> The confidence-building game // Local Chinese , most economists and bankers admit , are still hedging , making arrangements to live elsewhere and send their capital elsewhere if Peking reverts to its old capitalist-bashing ways . There are no statistics on human or capital flight ; they undoubtedly persist. // But the mainland Chinese are not the only ones involved in the high-stakes game of confidence building . The new architectural wonder of this city , the space-station-like headquarters building of the Hong Kong &; Shanghai Bank , was built in part to show faith in Hong Kong . Similarly , the Bank of China is erecting an I. M. Pei-designed tower here that will be the tallest building in Asia. // The bank towers are meant to demonstrate that Hong Kong has a future as dynamic as its past . But architecture alone can ' t keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurances from Peking . As 1997 approaches , the jitters may come and go , especially , some observers say , at the turn of the decade when the countdown will really begin. // Even after the changeover is accomplished 11 years from now , there will still be questions . But if mainland China has continued to liberalize , by then the fundamental question about whether communism can tolerate laissez faire capitalism may be moot. // A T-shirt for sale in some of the ubiquitous shirt shops shows two Chinese junks - one large , the other tiny - approaching each other at sunset . The rather tenderhearted caption reads : ' ' Hong Kong 1997 . Don ' t worry , we still love you. ' ' // //
