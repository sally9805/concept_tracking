The question comes from the Rev. Donald Wildmon , head of the National Federation for Decency : " Where is the TV show about a modern home with decent people ? " The glib answer is : Nowhere . Ordinarily , a crusade to purify the tales shown on the tube would deserve only that short shrift . But Wildmon 's question begs for a more thoughtful response , if only because TV 's gory and jiggly tales are not the only ones that are conspicuously short on niceness . The same can be said of most all the world 's fiction , narrative or dramatic , trash or quality . <P> True , ostensibly decent people turn up now and then in literature , but they almost never get depicted as being swept away by impulses to sweetness . They are more often set up for a comedown . On one end of the literary spectrum , Hamlet might have been a pleasant fellow if Shakespeare had not handicapped him with that belief in ghosts , plus suicidal and homicidal tendencies . On the other end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind up falling all over himself every time he tries to fetch a pail of water . In truth , the world 's literary and theatrical output , from high drama to nursery rhymes , is as violent and vice-ridden as yesterday 's news . Poet Ezra Pound may have had something of the sort in mind when he said : " Literature is news that stays news . ' ' <P> Storytellers , like journalists , have never been much for emphasizing the sweet , the decent , the well behaved . Odysseus , to pluck an early example from Homer , was a wife-neglecting troublemaker if there ever was one . Even in the inspired stories of the Bible , people seldom behave very well , beginning with Adam and Eve and proceeding to Cain and Abel and the folk in Sodom and Gomorrah . Contemporary fictions create their own mischief : Portnoy , for example , spends precious little time collecting for the United Fund . <P> Can nothing be done , then , to satisfy what might be called the niceness market ? Surprisingly the answer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Literature of Niceness to supplement the not-so-nice real thing . In a society that is overloaded with writers , there must be imagination enough to contrive sunnier alternative life-styles for many of the fictional characters who otherwise will endure in the pain , anguish and futile passion imagined by their authors . Why , for one instance , should n't King Lear be seen in some truly golden retirement years , preferably in an adults-only community ? And why not a tale in which Othello and Desdemona kiss and make up ? Imagine Lady Macbeth joining the Gray Ladies . Or Molly Bloom enrolling in needlepoint class . Or Sir Clifford Chatterley making a successful pilgrimage to Lourdes .
