txt TEHRAN  --  Out of the blue , the unsolicited phone call came at 9:10 a.m . Sunday : " This is the United States embassy , Be at the embassy gate at 10 a.m. for an interview with the students . " An hour later , under the curious gaze of a couple of dozen demonstrators clustered around a sign that said " No more false news , " the big wrought-iron embassy gate opened just wide enough for a person to squeeze through . &hind; us , it was quickly chained and padlocked again . Inside the embassy compound , there was n't much worth looking at  --  the usual anti-American posters , piles of debris stuffed into corners , ab ig black Buick off to one side with its hood up . ANOTHER REPORTER and I were handed small poink slips , special guest passes issued by the " public relations department " of the militants who have controlled the embassy since Nov. 4 . There was no sign of the 50 or so hostages , nor would there be during the next two hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rare and , regarding the hostages ' immediate future , disheartening closeup look at the philosophy and psychology that makes the militants tick . The most important point to emerge from nearly two hours of conversations was that they do n't feel isolated . THE SEVERAL hundred student militants at the embassy are determined to have their way , and confident that they enjoy the whole-hearted support of millions of " oppressed people , " including American blacks and Indians . They have not dropped their fundamental demands : ' ' The hostages will be freed and forgiven after the shah and the property of the Iranian people are returned . " Not even those hostages who are obviously innocent will be given their freedom , the militants said , unless cleared by an Islamic court to be set up some time in the future . Though the former shah is living on an island off the coast of Panama , the students appeared utterly convinced that the U.S. has the political power , as well as the moral duty , to have him sent back to Iran . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetoric , moral and religious self-justification , and exceptionally bitter criticism of President Carter , Carter was repeatedly called ' ' the devil , " a seeming reflection of the Islamis fervor that underscores the militants ' political activism . " Is n't he worse than Hitler and Nero and the worst criminals in history ? " asked one of their leaders . SOME OTIIER major points that emerged about the conviction of the militants were : ? They claim world-wide support and feel politically invincible : " No game like any economic blockade can have any effect . " ? The hostages ' hands are no longer tied , and they are in " the best condition possible , " so the captors believe they are acting humanely , Nothing was said about the emotional // Inside the U.S. Embassy with the Iranian militants // state of the hostages after 10 weeks in captivity . ? They are neither Marxist nor terrorist , as Carter charged last week , though they might support a revolutionary movement that had incidental Marxist participation . ? The superpowers , the Soviet Union as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so are the NATO alliance and the proposed SALT agreement . ? The American press consistently distorts events in Iran because it is tinder the thumb of a cabal of government officials , Industrialists , and Zionists . IT QUICKLY became evident that the student militants share a strict Islamic vision that eventually a world will develop in which " humanity will reign over weapons , and religion will rule over the world . " There was no hint whatever in the conversation that they felt the holding of hostages by armed guards might represent a deviation from their self-assured " humanistic " outlook . Led by several young people in semi- military clothing , we entered an outbuilding that once served as the embassy 's commercial library and proceeded through narrow corridors to a ground floor room marked " Interview Room Three . " AcOUSTIC TILE ON the walls and ceiling soundproofed the windowless room . It was furnished with a few chairs and a cloth covered table in front of two posters . One showed Ayatollah RuhoIlah Khomeini , and another exclaimed : " Down with the imperialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the side . A huge banner dominating one trail said , " We differentiate between the United States corrupt government and fair , honest Americans , " There was a general air of bustle and organization in the building . Young people moved quickly through the corridors , peeking in from time to time . First we spent all minutes with " Mary , " the interpreter , a stocky young woman in a voluminous cream-colored scarf , who , inexplicably , later changed from a green military jacket to a long cloth coat . MARY SPOKE accented but excellent English , with only an occasional slip . She is rumored to have spent her grade school years in the United States , while her father worked for tin engineering degree at the University of Pennsylvania . Her main point , expressed with considerable heat , is that the American press systematically twists news of Iran , especially when it says the hostages are badly treated . Repeatedly she insisted that the embassy militants would win the support of the American public if events were n't filtered through the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned with one of the young men who occupied a key role in the embassy takeover . HE . TOO , WORE the militants ' uniform , a green military jacket . His name was not given  --  only that he was on the students ' central governing committee . In his ** the young man had a dark intelligent face , and neatly trimmed hair . He spoke softly but intensely and wilhout hesitation . No question seemed to surprise him . His eyes were downcast throughout the interview . At one point he took a stack of snapshots of horribly mutilated bodies Ipresumably they were supposed to be victims of the shah ) and spread them out before us as if he were playing solitaire . A QUESTION ABOUT Carter 's accusation last week that the students were actually Marxist terrorists seemed to drive hint into a rage , although his tans remained matter of fact and brusque . " Carter 's dirty face , the dirty face of America . is being exposed to all the people of the world , " he replied . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly what the shah did : He called ow people terrorists . ... The Carters , the Nikons , the Kennedys , they always insulted the freedom-seekers of Iran . " The reply lingered on for 10 more minutes , and in it he laid hare the militants ' conviction of world-wide support for their struggle : " WE SHOWED THAT the will of the people can not he played around with by superpowers . When the people are persistent , no potter can resist them . " No game like any economic blockade can have any effect . " Time and again the militants ' leader evoked Islam as a cornerstone for a new world order ? " Islam . the religion of love , of praise of Gout , of freedom , of life . based on struggle against ? paressien , until the destruction of evil and the great devil , the United States .
