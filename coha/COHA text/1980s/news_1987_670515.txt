" You hear talk all the time that ' s wonderful language , " said Mr. Lois . " Street talk makes for sharp , punchy language. " // He gleans further material from Knicks games at Madison Square Garden , where he says he hears exchanged among the boisterous fans " the best repartee in the world. " // With the sounds of Harlem basketball and Knicks games buzzing in his brain , he once landed the Wheatena account for his agency with the slogan : " I know I feel meaner when I eat my Wheatena. " // " It was in my head from the streets , " said Mr. Lois , 52 years old , the creative director who also dreamed up " I want my Maypo ! " and , later updated , " I want my MTV ! " // Keeping in mind the high-priced creative energy that flows each day inside the offices of advertising executives like Mr. Lois , Theodore Baird , an English professor at Amherst College who had begun his teaching career in the city , told his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , he knew precisely what city he would be working in and on what street : Madison Avenue. // Is that still true ? Is it the world of advertising that attracts today ' s poets and playwrights ? Does Manhattan serve as their language laboratory ? Would " Out , damn spot ! Out , I say ! " be the lead-in , for example , to a detergent commercial ? // " I don ' t think Shakespeare ' d be good enough , " Mr. Lois said. // " I don ' t think he ' d like the deadlines , " said Jerry Della Femina , chairman of Della Femina , Travisano &; Partners Inc. , who was seated in a Manhattan restaurant not long ago when he came up with the headline for a condom ad : " I enjoy sex , but I ' m not ready to die for it. " // " I don ' t think he could persuade anybody , " said John Lyons , the creative director at Ketchum Advertising . " He was too long-winded. " // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably would be working on Madison Avenue , " said Howard Gould , a 24-year-old playwright who makes his living as a copywriter expounding the virtues of such would-be staples as Dr Pepper and Jell-O Mousse. // If theater and other literary forms are , if not in decline , then often no longer financially viable , then Madison Avenue indeed produces the literature for a society with a 30-second attention span . At the least , nowhere else does each syllable bring in more realities then in the multibillion-dollar world of advertising , where copywriters now earn up to $400 , 000 a year for their odes to the necessities and luxuries of modern life . <> <> ' Poets of Commerce ' // " In a very broad sense , " said Stephen A. Grayser , a professor of marketing at the Harvard Business School , " the creative people in advertising could be characterized as the poets of commerce. " // Every day , at a thousand different agencies , large and small - only a handful still actually situated on Madison Avenue - copywriters such as Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tofutti , in ways very different from the poet or fiction writer . They rarely work alone , preferring to team up with art directors. // " It ' s very , very different from writing plays , " said Mr. Gould , who works for Young &; Rubicam Inc . " It ' s hard in its own way . In a play you have a long period to get an idea across . Here , you ' re selling a product instead in a very compact punch. " // Like many of his colleagues , Mr. Gould , who majored in English at college , got into advertising by happenstance . During his senior year , Alan H. Zwiebel , a creative director at Young &; Rubicam , came to his school on a recruiting trip . Mr. Gould signed up for an interview at the suggestion of a friend , also an aspiring playwright , who went to work for Y. &; R. after college . <> <> ' A Way to Have Fun ' // Having no portfolio , Mr. Gould brought the play he had written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Messiah . " He ' s a very funny writer , " Mr. Zwiebel said. // " Alan asked me why I wanted to go into advertising , " Mr. Gould said . " I said I didn ' t know . Alan told me he originally wanted to be a painter but couldn ' t make any money at it . He said advertising was a way to have fun , come in every day and make money . I said , ' That ' s as good a reason as any. ' " // Jamie Seltzer is also a copywriter - a hot copywriter , according to some in the business - who earns a salary well into the six figures at Chiat-Day Inc . She landed a job in advertising after a career in serendipity - as a paramedic , a yoga instructor , a model , an assistant film editor and an assistant to an eye surgeon . Ms. Seltzer has worked on such accounts as Bazooka bubble gum , Pan American World Airways and a California toilet paper called MD. // " I never read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My language comes from how I talk. " // But the eternal debate rages - are they writers , or aren ' t they ? <> <> ' I Think We ' re Writers ' // " We ' re not writers , " Mr. Della Femina said . " We ' re salesmen . It doesn ' t sound as glamorous as calling ourselves writers and artists , but it ' s more true . If people ever talked the way advertising sounded , they would be put away. " // David Altschiller , 45 , who discovered advertising after he renounced his mother ' s dream that he become a doctor , takes the high road : " I think we ' re writers . We ' re understanding the human condition and selling to it. " // In fact , Mr. Altschiller , chairman and chief executive officer of Altschiller Reitzfeld Inc. , keeps on his desk the complete works of - you guessed it - William Shakespeare . He says it gives him inspiration . The city is definitely an idea laboratory for Jim Patterson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction writer who has produced six novels. // Mr. Patterson prowls the city ' s neighborhoods constantly , listening and sometimes talking to strangers . Everything and everyone is material . A young man who was playing the electric piano on the Upper West Side came in for an interview after Mr. Patterson dropped his business card in his hat one day . " We had a talk for an hour or so , " Mr. Patterson said . " He didn ' t feel this was the right environment for him. " // His agency has invited everyone from Martin Scorcese to Mayor Koch in for discussions - all in the aim of keeping the creative juices flowing. // George Lois , the creative director who goes to Knicks games , said the key to being a good advertising professional is more a matter of timing and listening that real literary talent . Being a success is being 30 days ahead of everyone else , he said. // " It ' s a semi-weird talent . " It isn ' t Joseph Heller and Norman Mailer . Joe Heller was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He talks about the fact that he was a lousy copywriter. " // So that was Heller . But what about Shakespeare ? // Well , take Polonius ' s famous line : " Neither a borrower nor a lender be. " // He ' d never get the Chase or Citibank account with that one , anyway. //
