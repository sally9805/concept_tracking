Bonnie Brewster is n't what you would expect in a boxing trainer . For one thing , she 's a woman . She does n't work fighters ' camps and corners either ; she trains recreational boxers . And she peppers her lessons on footwork and upper-cuts with personal philosophy . " Stand on your own two feet , " she yells while teaching the proper boxing stance . " It 's the same as in life ! " // There are a handful of female boxing trainers around the country , but Brewster , 35 , is the first to work at Gleason 's Gym , the venerable boxing haunt on Brooklyn 's waterfront . The gym did n't open its doors to women until 1986 . At the time , Brewster was working as an actor and a writer . She has appeared in soap operas ( The Guiding Light , One Life to Live ) , movies ( All That Jazz ) and regional theater productions . In 1985 she received an Edward Albee Foundation grant for playwriting , and she has written for several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brewster visited Gleason 's to research a story . She became so enamored of boxing that she decided to scrap the story and become a boxer herself . Brewster had been athletic all her life , but this was her first venture into such a brutal  --  and all-male  --  sport . // She started taking lessons at Gleason 's three to four times a week with Hector Roca , one of the gym 's most respected trainers . At 5 ' 3 " , 120 pounds , she had the right kind of body for boxing  --  short , stocky and strong  --  and trained under Roca for a year . " But it got to the point where Hector was n't showing me moves that he was showing the men , " says Brewster . " It made me angry . " // She tried to find another trainer , but her favorites were busy with pro fighters . So Brewster started watching boxing films and amateur bouts . She broke down the moves and began teaching herself the sport . Occasionally , she would consult Roca to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brewster 's boxing education convinced her that the gym needed a trainer who worked exclusively with serious recreational boxers , especially women . A year and a half ago she approached Bruce Silverglade , co-owner of Gleason 's , about becoming one . " I thought it was a great idea , " he says . // She attributes Silverglade 's enthusiasm partly to his business sense . " Boxing is at a low point in its history , " says Brewster , " and that decay has created a window of opportunity for women . The gyms are desperate for money . " // Brewster trains 17 women and three men in one-on-one sessions at Gleason 's . Among her students is Alicia McConnell , a seven-time national women 's squash champion . Brewster also teaches a coed class at nearby St. George Health &amp; Racquet Club . // Brewster and her students never duke it out , which means they receive the benefits of a boxing workout  --  getting in shape , learning technique and releasing aggression  --  without being punched . A typical hour-long session , for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , starts with stretching , jumping rope and shadowboxing . Then the students move to either the speed bag or the heavy bag . While Brewster yells out commands  --  one , uppercut , one , two , one !  --  her students pummel the heavy bag in three-minute rounds . They use jabs , uppercuts and crosses in various combinations . // Brewster 's advanced students join her in the ring for several rounds of noncombative sparring . She puts on heavily padded mitts and allows her students to slug away at them . To teach students to defend themselves , Brewster retaliates with light blows . // Although Brewster does n't punch her students , she has sparred with David Lawrence , president of Allied Programs Corp. , a New York City insurance company . While slugging away at Lawrence , who gives as good as he gets , Brewster wears custom-dyed magenta gloves , which have been autographed by Sugar Ray Leonard and Tommy Hearns. // She also slugs it out with her typewriter and recently finished a book on recreational boxing for women , which she hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a workout video and to conduct seminars on recreational boxing for fitness instructors . She would like to see recreational boxing become a mainstream participant sport . // It 's hard to imagine fitness freaks across the country exchanging running shoes for boxing gloves . But a few years ago , it would have been difficult to imagine a female trainer at Gleason 's Gym .
