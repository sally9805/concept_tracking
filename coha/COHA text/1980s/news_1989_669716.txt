Housewares , appliances , clothing , toys , cosmetics , records , even fashion boutiques fill six more floors of the two adjoining buildings . Not far away , on a local shopping arcade , fish sellers and vegetable stores are tightly wedged in between shoe shops and appliance dealers . The two shelves ringing an electronics store carry a display of dusty televisions. // // These are two ends of the maze that makes up Japan ' s distribution system . Japan has the highest number of retailers of any major industrial nation , most of them small shops . A manufacturer has to go through the most dense layer of wholesalers anywhere , with goods often passing through three or four hands before getting to the shelves. // The system is perpetuated by government policies that protect small shopkeepers and by business organizations that enjoy the benefits of controlled access . Huge companies have their own wholesalers and sometimes even retail outlets - electronics giant Matsushita has some 27 , 000 such stores. // The distribution system has become a major issue between Japan and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week to discuss structural barriers to reducing Japan ' s massive $50 billion trade surplus . The distribution system , Americans charge , acts to keep out imports , making it difficult for foreign goods to reach the Japanese consumer at affordable prices. // The reform of the distribution system is not , however , principally a US-Japan issue . The main force for change comes from within Japan - from large-scale retailers such as the Daiei group , from discount stores and all-night convenience chains such as 7-Eleven. // It comes from newcomers in the Japanese economy who , like foreign companies , are also locked out of the system. // And it gathers strength from Japan ' s oppressed consumers who are slowly waking up to the fact that they are paying the highest prices of any industrial nation. // Daiei , which aspires to be ' ' the Sears of Japan , ' ' is the leader of the rebels , symbolized by its feisty founder Isao Nakauchi . The Osaka-based company , started in 1957 , was the first to develop nationwide chain stores , building up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chains of convenience stores , supermarkets , and discount outlets. // The company proudly says it sold $1. 1 billion in imported goods in fiscal year 1988. // Daiei ' s greatest obstacle is the Large-Scale Retail Store Law , which is administered by the powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) . The law was passed in 1974 as a reform measure , supposedly replacing a license system with a simple procedure of notifying MITI of a company ' s plans for a new store. // In practice , however , the large retailer has to obtain the approval of its plans from the associations of shotengai , or shopping arcades , in the immediate area of a store . MITI enforces this ' ' consultation ' ' with ' ' administrative guidance , ' ' advising the store to make changes to meet shopkeepers ' demands. // Daiei negotiator Junji Kondo says this typically means bargaining with eight or nine shotengai associations simultaneously , offering to reduce hours of operation , floor space , or even the kinds of products sold , to get approval . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no next generation prepared to take over , resist the most , says Mr. Kondo . The entire process now takes an average of six to seven years and in some cases as long as 10 years. // The 1. 6 million small stores have a powerful ally in the ruling conservative party that depends heavily on the voter base and funding that they represent . In Japan , says Kondo , ' ' opening stores is not regarded as an economic issue - it is seen as a social and political issue. ' ' // In the battle for change , companies such as Daiei are happy to have support from America. // ' ' We would appreciate it if consumers would have more voice , ' ' says Daiei official Ryokichi Morishita . But lacking that , he adds , ' ' it ' s faster to have foreign pressure. ' ' // The large retailers , US companies agree , have greater will , as well as the display space , to carry imported products and to deal directly with foreign manufacturers. // ' ' The issue is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores , ' ' notes Bill Best , who headed a recent study of the distribution system by the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan . It found an overwhelming frustration among foreign companies with the barriers to entry. // Still , many foreign companies have had success . Some , emulating late entry Japanese companies , have gone around the maze by setting up their own direct sales networks . West Germany ' s BMW and Master Foods Mars candy division are the most recent examples of such success stories. // Others , like Procter &; Gamble , have done well by persevering to become part of the existing system . Ironically , the chamber study found many of those well-established Western companies are as reluctant as Japanese companies to have change. // Last week a MITI advisory panel issued a report on the future of the distribution system , the first major response to calls for reform . The system , the report asserts , is in a ' ' process of dynamic change , ' ' with the emergence of new structures of distribution , including those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' ' price gap ' ' caused by a lack of competitiveness. // Mr. Nakauchi of Daiei is skeptical of the impact of the report , but he credits MITI with making one step forward in finally accepting ' ' that the number of retailers will decrease . ' ' Economic and social forces , including the refusal of the next generation to enter the business , are reducing the number of stores athough they still number 132 per 10 , 000 people , compared to 65 in the US and 87 in France. // MITI ' s most concrete step is a revision of the administration of the large store law that will set time limits for consultation , shortening it to about two years. // ' ' That is not a drastic reform , ' ' retorts Nakauchi . Since MITI will retain its administrative power and has a vested interest in preserving that role , he says , ' ' the core of the problem is untouched. ' ' // The Japanese system ' ' is moving in a more open direction , ' ' says Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds , ' ' the key issue is pace. ' ' // //
