As disillusionment spreads , the Sandinistas face a new threat <P> For the celebration of the third anniversary of Nicaragua 's Sandinista revolution , the dusty provincial town of Masaya , 18 miles southeast of the capital city of Managua , last week was colorfully decorated with flags and posters . A band played revolutionary songs , and the crowds sang along . But there was little cheer in the speech delivered by Daniel Ortega Saavedra , a member of the all-powerful nine-man Sandinista Directorate . " Nicaragua is undergoing a silent , yet bloody invasion , " he declared . Ortega charged that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Honduran armed forces were supporting more than 2,000 rebels who have been operating along the border with Honduras . Since July 4 , he told his audience of 30,000 , the guerrillas had staged more than 18 attacks on Nicaraguan territory and killed more than 50 government troops . Ortega punctuated his statistics with repeated shouts that " this is not a figment of our imagination . " <P> Indeed it was not . The Sandinistas have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the first time since the end of the civil war that toppled right-wing Dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle in 1979 , the Sandinistas are being seriously challenged by armed groups of Nicaraguans who originally supported the revolution but who have become disillusioned with the regime 's strident Marxism , its disregard for individual rights and its increasing dependence on Cuba and the Soviet Union . The contras say they are fighting to fulfill the revolution 's original goals : political pluralism , individual liberties and a mixed economy . <P> The group responsible for much of the military action is the Nicaraguan Democratic Front ( F.D.N. ) , which claims to have 2,000 armed men who make regular incursions into Nicaragua from their sanctuaries in Honduras . Led by Jos Francisco Cardenal Telleria , a civil engineer , the F.D.N. has been especially active since March . Linked to the F.D.N. are many Miskito Indians who resent the Sandinistas for having forced thousands of them out of their homes along the Honduran border and into internment camps . The Miskitos are now in open revolt , and running battles with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past three weeks . The Honduran government has mostly turned a blind eye to the activities of the contras . <P> But the biggest threat to the Sandinistas comes from Edn Pastora Gmez , 46 , a flamboyant and popular former guerrilla leader known as Commander Zero . A hero of the Sandinista revolution , Pastora fled Nicaragua a year ago and eventually surfaced in Costa Rica last April . He passionately denounces his former comrades-in-arms as " traitors and murderers " and has called on the Nicaraguan people to " expel them from power . " For the present , Pastora 's strategy is to hope that his re-emergence will lead to the defection of other unhappy Sandinista supporters , and eventually divide the army so that he can come to power in what would amount to a coup .
