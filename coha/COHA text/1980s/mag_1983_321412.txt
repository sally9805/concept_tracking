Will they waltz away with yachting 's most hallowed prize ? <P> Imagine one of his myriad challengers actually kayoing Joe Louis in his prime , or a 20-game loser burning the ball past the lordly New York Yankees of the Babe Ruth era . For the sailing cognoscenti along the gilt-edged waterfront of Newport , R.I. , an upset of such proportions is a very real possibility . Not in anything so plebeian as boxing or baseball , to be sure , but in the patrician world of yachting , where , over the din of clinking champagne glasses , the chitchat is about fears that the longest winning streak in sports is about to end . After 132 years , the U.S. could finally lose the America 's Cup . <P> Such foul-weather forecasts have rattled Newport before . Yet ever since they first wrested the old silver mug from a fleet of the best yachts the British could muster in 1851 , the Yankee sailors have somehow managed to beat off all comers . What is different about this America 's Cup summer is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has got noticeably better , especially the yachtsmen from Down Under . <P> Neither the American yacht nor the challenger has yet been picked . But there is little doubt that when the two square off in the waters of Rhode Island Sound on Sept. 13 , the foreign contender will be a white-hulled marvel called Australia II that has set the yachting world back on its scuppers . The Australians seem to be doing everything right , beginning with a spectacular success at what has always been the heart of the American game : building yachts that are technologically superior to those of all their challengers . Measuring 64 ft. 7 in. from its snub-nosed bow to its raked-back stern , Australia II has the most radical keel ever to hang from the bottom of a 12-meter-yacht* . Though the Aussies ostentatiously drape a shroud over the keel when the boat is hauled out after each day 's sail-psych is everything in the America 's Cup competition-just about all of Newport knows what Australia H 's secret weapon looks like : it is bulging in the front , separates into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cross between a whale and the space shuttle . <P> The New York Yacht Club , custodian of the Cup and grand panjandrum of its defense , has howled that the radical keel is an infraction of the 12-meter rule , even though it passed muster earlier this year before keen-eyed measurers , including the club 's own tape man . With its lowered ballast and jetlike wings , the innovative yacht can slice through the water with less turbulence , turn virtually on a dime , and stand much more erect than its rivals when they beat into the wind , thereby drawing more power from its sails . Remarkably , all this seems perfectly within the rules . Even more remarkable , the new design has been working in Rhode Island Sound , where fickle winds and the backwash from the spectator fleet have broken many another seeming breakthrough .
