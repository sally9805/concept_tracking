That ' s the kind of thinking sponsors of limited partnerships hope will attract a significant part of the IRA market , particularly in real estate , equipment leasing , and oil and gas . In the relatively short time IRAs have been available to the public at large , the limited-partnership business has responded with a wide range of offerings aimed at this market. // To do so , however , the business has had to place new emphasis on a type of partnership it had not used much before and to make some other alterations. // // Still , limited partnerships are not for everyone , particularly for less-sophisticated investors - the minimum-asset standards of some limit them to upper-middle-income people and above - and some financial experts believe they may not be for anyone. // The most common form of limited partnership is the leveraged deal , which is made largely with borrowed money . This provides tax write-offs now and income later on , assuming the deal works out as advertised. // But using borrowed money in an IRA , where tax deductions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is considered ill advised. // ' ' It ' s rather pointless , ' ' one broker says . His firm sells limited partnerships to the IRA market , and he still doesn ' t like them ; hence he asked not to be identified . ' ' But you can have a limited partnership that isn ' t tax-sheltered at all. ' ' // It is this type of partnership , known as the ' ' unleveraged ' ' deal , that is attracting most of the IRA money today . Here , 100 percent of the money is raised before the real estate , oil well , or business equipment is purchased . Like leveraged limited partnerships , these are sold by brokers and financial planners . They have been selling pretty well , too . In 1982 , real estate limited partnerships that could be used for IRAs had sales of $979. 3 million , says Fuhrman Nettles , vice-president of Robert A. Stanger &; Co. , the Shrewsbury , N.J. , publisher of The Stanger Register , a guide to limited partnerships . Those 1982 sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnerships. // The next year , limited partnerships designed for IRAs had sales of more than $1. 9 billion , for 43 percent of that market . Last year sales climbed to $3. 3 billion , for a 58 percent share , Mr. Nettles said. // While a sales record like this indicates a fairly wide acceptance of limited partnerships as IRA vehicles , there are still some points to remember about them. // First , and perhaps most important , is the question of liquidity , or the ability to get your money out when you want to . When it comes to retirement accounts in particular , many people tend to watch them very carefully , more concerned over any negative performance than they would be with a general investment account . If things start to go bad with an equity mutual fund or a self-directed brokerage account , the customer can almost instantly retreat to a money market fund or time deposits at the bank . Even if the retreat is not a good idea from a long-range perspective , if it allows the individual to sleep better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limited partnership , however , getting out early may not only be bad strategy , it may also be impossible , at least without risking a loss of principal . Some limited-partnership deals take several years before they start to generate income . In the meantime , the customer is watching the value of his investment slide as management buys new properties and pays various expenses. // ' ' As far as IRAs go , I think limited partnerships are a very poor investment , ' ' says Jeb Brooks , president of Equity Resources , a Boston firm that provides a secondary market for private limited partnerships . ' ' The combination of high up-front fees and the lack of appreciation in assets for a minimum of a few years works against the investor . . . . In some deals , if you put in $1 , 000 , the day after your investment is worth $750. ' ' // Of the three most commonly used vehicles for IRA limited partnerships ( real estate , oil and gas , and equipment leasing ) real estate is considered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals . ' ' I would put equipment leasing and oil and gas well behind real estate , ' ' said Nettles . ' ' Until the price of oil and gas stabilizes , I ' d stay away from that one. ' ' // But even with real estate , financial advisers caution , investors should know something about how limited partnerships work and how the real estate market works and be able to compare offerings . In other words , these are for people who know what they ' re doing and have sufficient income to cushion unexpected problems. // For example , at Realty Income Corporation , an Escondido , Calif. , firm offering limited partnerships to the IRA market , investors are required to have at least $30 , 000 in annual income , plus $30 , 000 in assets , not including their home or cars . If they are not working , they are required to have at least $75 , 000 in assets , with the same home-and-car exclusions , says Gerard W. Delong , senior vice-president and national marketing director. // Liquidity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Any kind of investment in real estate carries a certain amount of illiquidity , ' ' he says . ' ' It ' s basically a different kind of situation ' ' from stocks or mutual funds . While the leases behind the Realty Income deals vary in length , they average about 20 years , DeLong says . The minimum is about 15 years , and they can run as long as 25 years. // Does this mean investors can not get out before 15 years ? Not necessarily , DeLong points out . His firm maintains an ' ' emergency pool of cash ' ' in every partnership , so that if an investor has some kind of emergency or hardship , he or she can simply write the firm and have a check sent back almost immediately. // Other partnerships are beginning to develop relationships with outside firms that maintain a secondary market in limited partnerships , says Mr. Nettles at Stanger . So if you can ' t sell your shares back to the original partnership , you may be able to sell them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still may incur a loss. // Otherwise , any earnings generated by the partnership are sent back to the custodian ( which can be the investor ' s own broker ) and can be passed on to other investments within the IRA or placed in a money market fund , where they await the next partnership offering . In any event , the earnings must be kept within the IRA to avoid withdrawal penalties and taxes. // If you choose or are forced to pull out of a partnership early , remember that you may end up getting out less than you put in . So it is important to check carefully the track record of the firm putting the deal together , to see what has happened to previous investors who left early . This won ' t guarantee what will happen to you , but it could be reassuring to know how the past record of a firm you are considering compares with some others. // //
