Charles Dickens died having finished only half of The Mystery of Edwin Drood , and that tantalizing incompleteness has prompted countless attempts to round off the novel 's Gothic plot . The story echoes Dickens ' familiar themes of unspoken sexual obsession , middle-class hypocrisy and the crushing burden of guilty secrets . It also contains some of his wittiest portraits of pomp and vanity . Fans of the book will look in vain for more than vague resemblances in the amiable musical version that opened on Broadway last week . Composer- Author Rupert Holmes has framed Drood within a Victorian music-hall pastiche , and the actors play both Dickens ' characters and the rowdy , self- mocking buskers of a troupe nearly as atrocious as the Crummles company in Nicholas Nickleby . Much of the rambling tale survives , but the wry tone , the hallmark of Dickens ' work , does not . <P> Taken on its own terms , however , Drood is vivacious , funny and richly tuneful , and it has an irresistible gimmick : the song and dance comes to a halt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The audience then votes to select the murderer and therefore the ending . This do-it- yourself detection has been honed since last summer 's tryout by Director Wilford Leach and Choreographer Graciela Daniele , the team that made a zonked- out Pirates of Penzance a 1981 Broadway triumph . Fully half of Holmes ' songs are instantly hummable , notably the sweet Perfect Strangers and the plucky Do n't Quit While You 're Ahead . The show 's style calls for singing and charm more than acting . That is just what it gets from Jazz Great Cleo Laine and Broadway Veterans Patti Cohenour , Betty Buckley and especially George Rose as a smug , unflappable M.C.
