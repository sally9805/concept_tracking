THE other morning the M.T.A. economy-lighted strobe train from Brooklyn , the D , failed to go over the Manhattan Bridge as it usually does , and instead borrowed the IRT ' s tunnel under the East River . Once in Manhattan , the D did a prodigious amount of backtracking and sidetracking so that , by the time it reached 42d Street , the first car had become the last and the last had become the first , and the passengers had become fuddled. // No matter . The motorman was a marvel of unflappable politesse and situational information . Never once did he say " have a nice day " at the stops the train did make . Instead , his wishes for the muchdelayed D-trainers progressed uptown from " Have a lovely day " ( West 4th ) , to " Have a great day " ( 34th ) , to " Have a fantastic day ! ( 42d ) .

The first thing I do every morning is to look out the window to see if the flags are flying over New York University : the red-white-and-blue American flag , and the purple pennant of N.Y.U. // I know if the flags are there , my day is going to be propitious . But if not , I must move with caution . For like Fate itself , the flags are unpredictable . Some days they are there ; others they aren ' t . Once I wondered : perhaps the Powers That Are make the flags flutter in the breeze of Greenwich Village only on Mondays and Thursdays ? Or on Tuesdays and Fridays ? So , I started to make charts . To no avail . One Monday the flags were there , the following Monday they weren ' t. // On a recent afternoon I passed the Main Building of New York University , and , on impulse , boldly walked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flags ? " I asked the first guard I encountered . He stared at me . Shrugged . Another guard joined us . He , too , was baffled . " Go and see Mr. Kelly , " another guard finally suggested. // The Mr. Kelly in question is the foreman of the daytime employees , and is to be found in the sub-basement of the building . I thought - for what reason ? - that I had to see this through , so I descended to the lower depths , asking directions as I went . Finally Mr. Kelly , a very pleasant gentleman , appeared from behind a door . Then I posed my question : I was poised for a hasty retreat. // Mr. Kelly listened . Politely , patiently . " Well , it ' s like this , " he said with a friendly smile . " I usually listen to the weather forecast . If they say it ' s going to rain or snow , or if there ' s going to be a lot of wind , I don ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " Oh . " When I returned to the main floor , one of the guards I ' d talked to asked me if I ' d found out about the flags . " Yes , " I said , and told him the story. // Then he , too said : " Oh . " Then he grinned . " Makes sense , doesn ' t it ? " Well , I guess it does . But just what about my daily oracle ? I suppose it ' s some consolation to realize that from now on I ' ll know what the weather is going to be like . . . STELLA K. HERSHAN //
