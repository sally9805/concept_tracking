In 1983 , three years before Corazon Aquino rode a wave of national anger to become President of the Philippines , one of the country 's most astute political observers made an eerily prescient assessment . " So she becomes the rallying point , " he said . " Immediately , corruption will increase . Everybody will feather his nest . At that point , she will be nudged to the side and be made a scapegoat for the mess . Then the military will take over . They will say , ' Well , we 've given you your chance . ' But they will have made sure she would fail . They will then throw her to the people , and they will come in as the great saviors of the republic . " The prediction was made by the President 's husband Benigno Aquino Jr . shortly before he was assassinated in August 1983 . And though he was talking about Imelda Marcos , his scenario was coming true last week for his coup-plagued widow . <P> As Manila 's financial district squeaked away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian Beirut , the President essayed a show of strength by reaching for the People Power that brought her to office . Still , in tacit disobedience to Aquino 's stand against a negotiated end to hostilities , her military did not so much quell the coup as reconcile with those who had come closer than ever to unseating her . Even before the latest coup ended , plots were being hatched for the next stage of the rebellion , one the planners are certain will bring about Aquino 's fall . As a government trooper who helped put down the mutiny said of the rebels : " Sir , they are not the enemy . " <P> Just as she has done after every other major coup attempt , the President displayed resolve and dispatch . Aquino peremptorily summoned the country 's Senators to Malacanang Palace and bluntly presented them with her declaration of a national state of emergency , the closest thing to martial law that the constitution allowed her to impose . At the People Power rally , Aquino , dressed in her trademark yellow , delivered her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political enemies of colluding with the mutineers . She specifically mentioned Vice President Salvador Laurel , opposition Senator Juan Ponce Enrile and her cousin Eduardo Cojuangco , a wealthy crony of Ferdinand Marcos who sneaked into the country a week before the uprising . <P> As many as 100,000 Filipinos showed up to wave banners and shout , " Cory ! Cory ! " However , it was reported that some participants were bused in from the provinces , and the government 's claim of a turnout of 1 million was hyperbole . But the crowd loved her performance . Said a bystander : " Now we can sleep at night . "
