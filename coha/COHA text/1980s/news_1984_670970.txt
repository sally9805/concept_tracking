" We want to see if the rule is working and what modifications might be necessary , " Mr. Easton said. // Part of the success in getting the regulation accepted by funeral directors , Mr. Easton said , is attributable to a commission program of acquainting the undertakers with the rule . It calls for fines of up to $10 , 000 for each violation , he noted . <> <> Free Booklet for Consumers // The Federal agency has also issued 81 , 000 copies of a booklet for consumers detailing its rules on funerals .

There may be a decline in prices , he said , but he cautioned against misinterpreting it , because it might reflect a continuing trend toward cremation , which usually costs less than burial. // There has not been a decline in embalming even though families are being told that it is usually not a legal requirement , Mr. Bohardt said .
