As the Industrial Revolution gathered strength in the 19th century , English workmen attempted to destroy new textile machines because they seemed to be taking away their jobs . Nearly two centuries later , some employees are using similar tactics against the new robots that are beginning to appear in more and more plants . <P> Gerrit Nijland , a professor of industrial robotics at Berenschot Management Training Center in The Netherlands , has just concluded a study of the acceptance of the automatons in his country , where 70 firms currently use robots . He found that the most common form of sabotage was to slow down the machines by feeding them parts in the wrong order , with the hope that management would be disappointed in robot performance . In other cases , employees repaired the machines incorrectly , mislaid essential spare parts or put sand into the robots ' lubricating oil . In one metal construction plant , production was reduced for more than six months because of worker resistance . Other companies are certain to face similar troubles , says Nijland , unless management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robots will have on jobs .
