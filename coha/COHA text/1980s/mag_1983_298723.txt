Senator Henry Jackson : 1912-1983 <P> Most of Congress had something to say about the downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 , but in the state of Washington , Senator Henry ( " Scoop " ) Jackson 's reactions had a double resonance : his constituents at the Boeing Co. built the 747 airliner , and during his 42 years on Capitol Hill , he had been more profoundly and articulately wary of the Soviet Union than any other national Democrat . Last week Jackson was recovering at home from a chest cold picked up during a trip to China , but on Thursday morning , he shrugged it off and drove into Seattle to talk to reporters about the aerial atrocity . It was " an act of barbarism , " he said , and could have been planned in advance . <P> But for all his characteristic harshness , he was , as usual , thoughtful and careful . The U.S. should not strike back militarily , he said , adding , " The strongest arm of response is the moral one , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United Nations ? Replied Jackson : " I would rather call a prayer meeting . " Afterward Jackson , 71 , went back to his wife Helen in Everett ( pop . 54,400 ) , the lumbermill town north of Seattle where he was born and raised . And where , a few hours after he got home , he suffered a heart attack and died . <P> " Jackson , " said Sam Nunn , his Democratic colleague from Georgia , " truly was a giant in the Senate . " He had decisively won six elections to the Senate , the latest last November , and had been the de facto leader of his party 's conservative wing . Jackson felt that his onetime comrades had turned too easy on Communism , or in some cases too hard on social programs , while he remained the archetypal cold war liberal , determined that the U.S. spend generously on guns and butter . " I do n't worry about ideologies , " he said . " I 've been called a Communist , a socialist , a conservative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contender for the Democratic presidential nomination . <P> His death surprised those who knew him . Jackson was fit and industrious , and never smoked . He had no history of heart trouble , and lived prudently . The habit of prudence was bred by his parents , Norwegian immigrants . Nicknamed Scoop after a comic-strip character who appeared in the Everett Herald ( which he delivered for years ) , Jackson practiced frankness young : in the third grade , asked what he wanted to be when he grew up , he admitted he wanted Warren G.Harding 's job . <P> He started at the University of Washington as the Depression began and returned to Everett with a law degree , taking a job with the new Federal Emergency Relief Administration . But his notions of public service were more ambitious . At 26 , he was elected Snohomish County prosecutor ; then in 1940 , a year after Mr. Smith Goes to Washington , Mr. Jackson was sent there for real , elected to the House . He caught the nation 's eye by speaking out early on against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1952 Jackson won election to the Senate over a Red-baiting Republican , and sat on the committee that grilled Wisconsin 's Joseph McCarthy in the 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings .
