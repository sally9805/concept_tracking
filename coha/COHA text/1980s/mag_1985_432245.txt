 | In the aftermath of the Beirut hostage drama , American television is caught up in a fierce controversy over its role in the crisis and its impact on presidential decision making . TV 's coverage of the 17-day hijack episode is coming under sharp attack from critics who charge that the networks allowed themselves to be used as propaganda tools by the terrorists . But the issues go beyond the behavior of television in the latest terrorist episode . More fundamental questions are being raised about the effect of the networks generally on decision making in America 's open democracy , particularly in foreign crises involving the possible use of military force . Specifically : Does saturation TV coverage of a dramatic development limit the President 's options ? Is the Chief Executive compelled to become so preoccupied with an event such as the TWA hijacking that other urgent government business is neglected ? In short : Does television put a democracy at a disadvantage in dealing with crises of this sort ? Zbigniew Brzezinski , national-security adviser in the Carter administration , says there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes to coping with hijackers and other hostage takers . On the basis of his experience as crisis manager during the Teheran hostage crisis and a close observer of the latest episode , he cites three reasons for his conclusion : " First , TV transforms essentially a political confrontation into a personal drama . The result is , you can not deal with it coldly in terms of the national interest but you must focus on the personal aspects . " Secondly , as the confrontation becomes a personal drama , the bargaining capacity of the kidnappers is enhanced . Concentration on accommodation by the American government becomes more important . " Thirdly , it humanizes the enemy . Therefore , you begin to make equations and equivalences , which dulls the sharpness of the possible response . " In the Beirut hostage drama , most analysts agree that the U.S. networks emerged as players shaping events more than as reporters simply transmitting the news . A senior White House official denounces the role of television as " abominable . " " TV probably is going to cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation like this sometime in the future , " he says . " I just think it 's awful . " Critics assert that the networks became unwitting accomplices to the terrorists by scrambling to provide them access to the American public and to interview the hostages under the guns of their captors . The competition reached such a point that several hostages described ABC facetiously as " the Amal Broadcasting Company . " The hijackers and Amal leader Nabih Berri skillfully exploited the opportunity to dominate U.S. television and especially the peak-audience evening news programs to pressure the Reagan administration to meet their demands . Amal even copied a White House policy for press coverage of major events by insisting that all interviews must be " pooled " by the networks , thus insuring maximum exposure . Why not nothing ? Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , during the confrontation , went so far as to call for a blackout in Beirut by U.S. news media . " It is a humiliation for the United States to have American citizens trotted out one by one , being forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think what the media ought to consider is not to carry anything , including the terrorists . " The networks are clearly on the defensive about their performance in Beirut , which one TV correspondent called " the theater of the absurd . " They contend that they actually contributed to the safety and well-being of the hostages . Once the hijackers allowed interviews , network spokesmen argue , the danger that they would kill their captives diminished . Some of the prisoners agree . They have indicated that they welcomed the interviews as a way of communicating with their families back home . One of them expressed that sentiment as he was on his way to freedom on the road leading out of Beirut . As he gave a thumbs-up sign to a CNN crew filming the departure , he said , " Thank the Lord we 're on our way . Thanks for all the coverage . " As for the charge that American television allowed itself to be exploited by the hijackers , John Chancellor , senior commentator at NBC News , offers this argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television networks had magically agreed not to cover the crisis as they did , I suspect that one of the terrorists ' demands would have been for a camera . " Some network officials concede that their coverage of the hijacking drama was  | excessive . In fact , one asserts that " the viewing public became bored with the story once the terrorists threw no more bodies out of the plane . " Drama and journalism . Still , whatever the final verdict on the role of the networks in the latest terrorist episode , there is a widespread conviction that television is a new phenomenon that , by its very nature , poses serious problems for democracies in managing crises . This is considered especially true for a government in the U.S. with its freewheeling press and strong bias against any constraints . The phenomenon stems from these arguments : TV is dramatic as well as journalistic ; it concentrates essentially on what can be filmed ; by use of communications satellites , it can transmit into virtually every American home instant visual coverage of dramatic events around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans as their principal source of news . NBC 's John Chancellor describes the special qualities and limitations of television this way : " You have journalism , which is thoughtful and considered , and you have what I call electronics , ' which is the use of our facilities to transmit pictures and words , but does not have a lot to do with journalism . " All this , say officials and foreign-affairs analysts , affects the conduct of government in three ways : 1 . In a crisis , television can dictate the national agenda by getting the public and the White House to focus on the crisis issue to the exclusion of virtually all else . That was evident during the 444 days of the Teheran hostage confrontation even more than during the 17 days of the Beirut drama . 2 . The President comes under pressure to react hastily in a crisis in order to avoid giving the appearance of being either passive or incompetent . To quote Lloyd Cutler , White House counsel in the Carter administration : " If . an ominous foreign event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisers feel bound to make a response in time for the next evening news program . " 3 . The President 's freedom of maneuver may be narrowed by television 's impact on public and congressional opinion . The Chief Executive may be pressured to embark on an ill-conceived action ? as President Carter did in mounting the failed Iran hostage rescue ? or he may find it more difficult to use military force in a situation where it is warranted . Code of conduct ? Austin Ranney , resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute , put it this way : " If there had been live television coverage of the Civil War , it would have ended in 1862 with the establishment of the Confederacy because it was a terribly bloody war and the North was losing most of the early part of it . " With all the misgivings about the effects of TV , the consensus among policymakers no less than among media experts is that it is a phenomenon that the United States government must learn to live with and , indeed , to use to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the price the United States pays for democracy , and there is nothing that government can ? or should ? do about it . White House officials say there is no intention of utilizing the government 's licensing powers to place restrictions on the networks or even to pressure them to police themselves . Outside of the administration , there are those ? including former National Security Adviser Brzezinski ? who are calling on the networks to adopt a voluntary code of conduct to govern their behavior in situations such as the Beirut hostage crisis . One element of such a code , some analysts suggest , might require TV to show on-screen notices that hostage interviews are being conducted under duress . At this stage , however , network executives flatly reject any such proposals . But some political observers believe that a repeat of the television orgy in Beirut could well force the networks to adopt a voluntary code of conduct rather than risk a government move to impose regulations in a crisis .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
