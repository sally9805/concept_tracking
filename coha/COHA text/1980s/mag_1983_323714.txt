War &; No Peace <P> THE NAKED AND THE DEAD ( 721 pp. ) - Norman Mailer-Rinehart ( $4 ) . <P> A 25-year-old Harvard graduate who fought at Leyte has written perhaps the best novel yet about World War II . <P> It is distinguished primarily for simple realism , a forthright , almost childlike honesty , a command of ordinary speech , a cool and effortless narrative style . The battle scenes are so vivid as to suggest War and Peace , the common soldiers as clearly visualized as Tolstoy 's peasants . Unlike Tolstoy 's masterpiece , it is all war , not only in the sense that there are no scenes of peaceful life poised against the scenes of war , but in the sense that a knowledge of the meaning of peace is absent from the characters . They seem never to have known anything else .
