At 52 , Maurice Sendak has become America 's master illustrator . Almost all of the 78 books he has written or decorated are still in print . Some , like A Hole Is to Dig , Where the Wild Things Are , Higglety Pigglety Pop ! Or There Must Be More to Life , and The Nutshell Library , are contemporary classics ; all are collector 's items . <P> Most of his drawings are in the possession of the Rosenbach Foundation in Philadelphia ; the few that come up for sale fetch prices of up to $12,000 each . For a man who describes himself as " a solitary and an agonizingly slow worker , " Sendak has had an uncharacteristically gregarious year . He oversaw the printing of his new book , Outside Over There , to be published this spring , aided in the production of his off-Broadway musical Really Rosie , designed sets for the Houston Opera 's version of The Magic Flute and is at work on the New York City Opera 's American premiere of Jancek 's The Cunning Little Vixen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookstores to sign copies of a coffee-table retrospective , The Art of Maurice Sendak , by Selma G. Lanes . In the midst of this hectic schedule he paused for breath in his bachelor retreat in rural Connecticut and reminisced with New York Bureau Chief Peter Stoler : <P> Maurice Sendak derives much of his creativity from two early sources , a photograph of his bearded patriarchal grandfather ( " I thought he was the image of God " ) and Mickey Mouse . " Mickey was born the same year I was , " says the artist , who has the beard of a prophet and the astonished look of Disney 's creation . " I keep acknowledging Mickey and my grandfather in my work . " Much of that work is filled with private references : the bakery of his Brooklyn childhood is the scene of In the Night Kitchen , where another early hero , Oliver Hardy , is hard at work . The child 's name is Mickey , in honor of Disney 's rodent . The fearful , cheerful creatures in one of his best-known books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'd say , ' You 're so cute I could eat you up . ' And I knew if my mother did n't hurry up with the cooking , they probably would . So , on one level at least , you could say that the Wild Things are Jewish relatives . " At first those relatives were not encouraging to young Maurice . He remembers being " a miserable kid who excelled neither scholastically nor athletically . " But he could draw , and he could read . When he was six , he collaborated on a book with his older brother , and when his big sister gave him books for birthday presents , he found a land as new as the one his Polish immigrant parents had sought .
