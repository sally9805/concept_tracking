By Nena Groskind I have an FHA-insured mortgage on which I am having trouble making the payments because I recently lost my job . Is there anything I can do to avoid losing my house ? - D.W. , East Boston The first thing you should do is inform your lender of the problem . Most lenders prefer to avoid foreclosure if they can , and yours may be willing to reduce or defer your mortgage payments until you get back on your feet financially . Barring that , the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) has a program designed to assist buyers with FHA mortgages who , for reasons beyond their control , are unable to meet their mortgage commitments . Under its existing " assignment " program , HUD will buy back the mortgage from the lender and work out new terms with the borrower - either reducing or suspending mortgage payments for a specific period . That assistance program is now in effect , but HUD wants to replace it with what the agency is calling a Temporary Mortgage Assistance Payments ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay off the outstanding mortgage ; instead , the lender retains the loan and HUD temporarily takes over the payments until the borrower is able to assume them again , or until HUD decides that a foreclosure is necessary . The borrower and the lender get essentially the same protection under both HUD programs ; the primary beneficiary of the switch to TMAP is HUD , whichavoids , or at least defers , the mortgage pay-offs that have cost the federal government an estimated $457 million since the assignment program began in 1976 . TMAP also contains a provision allowing HUD to recover the cost of the assistance provided to a borrower if the house is sold or if it is rented for more than one year . ( Under the existing assignment program , there is no recovery provision . ) The eligibility requirements for TMAP and the assignment program are essentially the same . The borrower must be at least three months behind in his/her mortgage payments and the lender must demonstrate that everything possible has been done to avoid foreclosure . In addition , the borrower ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. job loss , illness , etc. ) and there must be a reasonable prospect that the borrower will be able to resume full payments at a later date . In addition , the residence must be the borrower ' s principal residence and the borrower receiving assistance can ' t own any other property subject to another HUD-insured loan . The new TMAP program is awaiting final approval from Congress and the Office of Management and Budget and is expected to be implemented in late July or early August . I recently graduated from college and am interested in becoming a real estate broker . I have my salesman ' s license but have been a little discouraged by news reports about the dismal housing market . Is this a good time to enter the field ? - L.C. , Boston Not if you have difficult habits to support - like eating and paying the rent . On the other hand , if you have another source of income or don ' t have to worry about supporting yourself in the near term , this might be an excellent time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find one that is adding new people ) and gain as much experience as you can while the market is slow . That way you will have the preliminaries behind you and be ready to take off when the market does . When I rented my apartment I had to pay the last month ' s rent in advance . Under the new lease I just signed , my rent is being increased $30 a month . In addition , my landlord says I have to add $30 to the last month ' s rent payment he is holding . Can the landlord increase the amount of my last month ' s rent payment at this point , and if I refuse to pay , can he say I ' m in arrears in my rent and evict me ? - H.R. , Methuen My attorney says your landlord is within his rights in requiring additional payments to keep your last month ' s rent current with your prevailing rent as long as the increase comes at the beginning of a new rental agreement and not in the middle of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any other " valid and enforceable " condition of your lease , my attorney says , your landlord will have grounds to initiate eviction proceedings against you .
