The second half of the 20th century has been full of uneasy trade-offs and Faustian bargains . One after another , life 's most intimate and privileged matters  --  sexual relations , conception , birth and death  --  have been delivered to the unsanctified ground of science and commerce . The results may be welcome : the laboratory study of sex leads to treatments for sexual dysfunction ; technologies of fertility give hope to the childless ; mechanical organs offer the chance of longer life . But even as the gains are counted , the reservations mount . Even when the mind assents , the heart sometimes shivers . <P> For anyone but the central figures , and perhaps for them as well , mixed emotions are the only kind that seem fitting to bring to the New Jersey courtroom where a landmark case involving custody of a 9 1/2-month-old infant is being heard . Mary Beth Whitehead thought she knew herself in 1985 , when she contracted , as a surrogate mother , to bear a child for William and Elizabeth Stern . But her certainties crumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls Sara , the Sterns call Melissa and court papers call Baby M. In hours of emotional testimony last week , Whitehead told the court that the experience of childbirth " overpowered " her . Her husband said that after handing over the child to the Sterns , his wife cried hysterically , asking , " Oh God , what have I done ? " <P> The court battle over Baby M. will answer only a part of that question . In deciding the case , New Jersey Superior Court Judge Harvey Sorkow becomes the first judge in the U.S. asked to enforce a surrogate agreement . He could treat the case mainly as a contract dispute , rule that the contract is valid and award the child to the Sterns . Or he could opt to treat it basically as a custody battle ; then the best interests of the child would be the guiding principle . Custody is often awarded to mothers , but since Baby M. has been living with the Sterns at the judge 's order for most of the time since she was born , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost certain to be appealed . Yet even when the final court has its final say , the echoes of Whitehead 's anguished question will still hang in the air . If a society legitimates surrogacy , what has it done ? Has it imperiled its most venerable notions of kinship and the bond between mother and child ? Has it opened the way to a dismal baby industry , in which well-to-do couples rent out the wombs of less affluent women , sometimes just to spare themselves the inconvenience of pregnancy ? Yet if surrogacy is prohibited , has a promising way for childless couples to have families been denied them ? And what if the truest answer to those questions is also the most problematical  --  yes to all the above ?
