So Morris Albert 's Feelings is n't really Morris Albert 's Feelings at all . No , the treacly pop song that sold more than a million records in 1975 is really a rewrite of Pour Toi , a hitherto obscure French cafe tune composed nearly 20 years earlier by one Louis Gaste . That , at least , is what a nonmusical federal-court jury in Manhattan decided last July , awarding Gaste a settlement of at least half a million dollars . Gaste pronounced himself vindicated . Albert 's feelings were unknown . <P> Every so often , it seems , an aggrieved composer emerges from obscurity to lay claim to a particular pop hit . More often than not , somebody is ready to believe him  --  or afraid somebody else will . The melodic and rhythmic resemblance between a four-bar stretch of Jerry Herman 's 1964 classic Hello Dolly ( " Hello , Dolly , well , hello Dolly . It 's so . . . " ) and Mack David 's 1948 quotidian hit Sunflower ( " She 's a sunflower , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost Herman $250,000 when he indignantly settled out of court in 1966 . Ten years later , former Beatle George Harrison was nicked for $400,000 when a judge ruled that the 1970 number My Sweet Lord ( " Hare Krishna " ) closely resembled the Chiffons ' 1963 single He 's So Fine ( " Doo lang , doo lang , doo lang " ) . And in 1983 a Chicago jury ruled that the Bee Gees ' How Deep Is Your Love ( 1977 ) was a little too deeply influenced by a 1975 ditty called Let It End , by Ronald Selle . <P> Intentional homage , subconscious emulation or calculated rip-off ? For Selle 's suit against the Bee Gees , four bars of the two scores were blown up to display a suspiciously exact correspondence of notes ; on the witness stand , even Bee Gee Maurice Gibb could n't tell the two songs apart . The similarities between Herman 's song and David 's consisted of an identical series of ten intervals . And My Sweet Lord really does sound very much like He 's So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is this really irrefutable evidence of plagiarism ? Musicians , if not juries , know the question is not so easily answered . " We 're very childish in our notions as to what constitutes originality in music , " wrote the composer and music critic Deems Taylor in 1939 . " Suppose a play should open tomorrow in which one of the actors had the line , ' Now go to the door and stay there till we call . ' How many dramatic critics would point out that it was a direct steal from Shakespeare ? But it is . It 's straight out of the first scene of the third act of Macbeth . If a new symphony contained that much of a quotation from Beethoven or Wagner , the music critics would jump all over the composer . "
