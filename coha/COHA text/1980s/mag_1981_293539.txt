His deadpan style disguises a compassion for the peevish , the confused and the lonely . The Old Boys ( 1964 ) and The Boarding House ( 1965 ) had funny moments ; yet the novels ' deeper impressions were made by sympathy for the elderly and middle-aged attempting to preserve a fleeting respectability . The Love Department ( 1967 ) rollicked along on the efforts of a lovelorn columnist to stamp out adultery , but the book is remembered best for a punishing point : seducers can be staggering bores .

Tyte 's face , lean and handsome in the Leslie Howard mold , is known to millions of British telly viewers .

Behind his boyish smile , Tyte is one of the crawliest characters in recent fiction . He specializes in making a mockery of privacy . " Make-belief is all we have , " he tells another actor , a woman who plays the part of an infant murderer in a television play . Tyte 's personal script usually starts with the story that he was orphaned when his parents were killed in a train crash . In truth , Mom and Pop are in a retirement home that Francis never visits . Having eased his way on sympathy , he plays it by ear and keeps an eye open for opportunities . " ' You 'll bring your dragon brooch ? ' he said , speaking of their honeymoon . ' And your little sapphires and your seed pearls ? ' Surprised , Julia replied that jewellery could be a nuisance when you were travelling . ' I want to show you off . ' sHe smiled at her .
