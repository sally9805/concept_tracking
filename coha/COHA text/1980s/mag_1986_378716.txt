As scenes of terrorist carnage unfolded in Vienna and Rome , a spasm of racial violence shattered seasonal hopes of peace and goodwill across South Africa . For the country 's whites , all signs appeared to point to a new and ominous phase of killing , one that seemed to bear out recent warnings by the outlawed African National Congress ( A.N.C. ) that " soft " targets  --  meaning unarmed civilians , including whites  --  would no longer be off limits . Nonetheless , blacks suffered the brunt of the year-end violence . At least five people died in the township of Soweto , as militants fought with migrant workers who refused to observe a " black Christmas " boycott called by the militants to honor those who had died since the violence began in September 1984 . In Natal province , 58 blacks were killed when 2,000 Zulus and 3,000 members of the Pondo tribe , armed with spears , shields , clubs and shotguns , clashed in a Christmas Day battle sparked by tribal and political rivalries . <P> To blacks and whites alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas , as holiday shoppers crowded the gaily decorated arcades of the Sanlam shopping center in Amanzimtoti , 18 miles south of Durban . Outside an ice-cream parlor , a crowd of parents and children had gathered around a festive display featuring Santa Claus when a bomb hidden in a nearby garbage bin exploded . Within seconds , the scene of holiday merriment was transformed into grim mayhem . Five whites , among them a two-year-old child , were killed . In all , 61 people , including several blacks , were injured . <P> Until now , South African whites , who for the most part live in segregated enclaves that exclude blacks , have been well insulated from such violence . Indeed , of the 850 South Africans killed in the country-wide unrest in 1985 , only 15 have been white civilians . While many whites have been concerned about the black unrest and attendant violence , few felt immediately threatened . The Sanlam shopping center bombing has shaken that confidence . <P> With good reason . It was the third time in eight days that whites had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unidentified non-white youth threw a hand grenade under a van parked on a crowded Durban street , injuring eight whites . On Dec. 15 , six whites were killed when their truck hit a land mine as they drove along a road near the Zimbabwe border . The A.N.C . admitted that it had planted the device , as well as six others that have killed seven and injured eleven since November . Predictably , the government of State President P.W . Botha promptly blamed the A.N.C . for the Sanlam bombing . But the organization 's silence has led some analysts to speculate that the incident may have been the work of a militant A.N.C . offshoot . <P> Members of the right-wing Conservative Party hotly denounced the attacks and called for Botha to retaliate by cracking down on the rebels and their supporters . Later in the week Lesotho , one of the neighboring countries the South African government has long accused of harboring A.N.C . rebels , claimed that its territory had been raided by South African commandos who gunned down nine A.N.C . members and sympathizers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned the State Security Council , South Africa 's neighbors " must be urged to realize that if this menace is allowed to continue , all the people of southern Africa will pay a heavy price .
