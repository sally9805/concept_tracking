They are so promising that other clubs constantly ask for them in trade talks . They are so essential that the Mets constantly say no . They pitched in 120 of the Mets ' 162 games last season , won 15 , saved 28 and struck out nearly one batter every inning. // Frank Cashen , the general manager of the Mets , considered his twin assets this week and said : " I can ' t think of two guys who were so good so young since Rich Gossage and Terry Forster on the Chicago White Sox in 1972 . They are a pair of finds . Allen was signed out of high school in Kansas City by Ed Charles . And Reardon wasn ' t drafted by anybody coming out of the University of Massachusetts , so we signed him mainly to fill out a club in the low minor leagues. " // Both pitchers are right-handers with snapping stuff , and both began their careers as starters . But the similarity ends there . Allen is fresh-faced and outgoing ; Reardon wears a brooding look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell . Allen strikes out people with a sharp curve ; Reardon relies on a cannonball serve . Allen is 23 years old and has had two seasons in the major leagues ; Reardon is 25 and has had one . Allen makes $150 , 000 a year ; Reardon recently signed for $70 , 000 after threatening to boycott spring training . But both could earn more through bonuses if they duplicate their success of 1980. // They have also been portrayed frequently as jealous rivals competing for the chance to get into games in ninth-inning crises in order to win credit for the statistical plum , the save . They deny bitterness and insist that they are friends . But Reardon concedes that he complained last season about his role , because he felt that he was pitching in Allen ' s shadow. // " I was the tie-game man , " Reardon said . " He was the save-game man . Even if I was pitching in a game and we went ahead , I ' d be yanked for a pinch-hitter and Neil would come in. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average and innings pitched , and I had more of those than Neil . Yet , saves give you recognition . You ' re always reading in every preview of the Mets that Neil Allen is the big man in the bull pen and I ' m an also-ran . They used to say the same thing about Bruce Sutter on the Cubs , and yet Bill Caudill was the guy who ' d blow us away in games and didn ' t get the credit . <> <> Allen Had More Experience // " Joe Torre called me into his office four or five times to explain things . The big thing was that Neil had that one more year of experience . But Joe also told me that he was managing the team and would pitch anybody he wanted , so not to let it bother me . I won ' t let it bother me anymore. // " Joe insists he doesn ' t have a No. 1 guy and a No. 2 guy . Just two No. 1 guys in the bull pen . Besides , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ' s a lot of money . I used to make $3 , 000 in the minors. " // Allen also discounts the statistical value of saves and denies any hard feelings or rivalry . " We ' ve got to be happy with each other ' s success , " he said . " We can ' t control how they use us . It ' s healthy to feel that Jeff ' s right on my tail . He ' s after the saves , too , but there ' s no bitterness . I feel we ' re the best two young pitchers in baseball. // " Saves aren ' t important . Keeping your earned run average down is all that matters . Saves are gifts in some situations . There ' s even the one-pitch save . " <> <> Impressive Statistics // Last summer , pitching for a fifth-place team that often played cliff-hanging baseball , they handled pressure extravagantly . Allen didn ' t allow a run in 37 of his 59 appearances . During one streak of 18 games , he won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different pitchers . And he ended the season with 22 saves , fourth best in the league. // Reardon got credit for only six saves , but he won eight games in relief , more than any starter on the team except Mark Bomback . In one span of nine innings across five games , he struck out 15 batters . In another , he worked 29 innings in 17 games , struck out 25 batters and allowed only three runs. // Both pitchers became relievers when Torre got desperate for help . He sent Allen to the bull pen in 1979 after Skip Lockwood was injured . He watched Reardon in the Instructional League that autumn after Reardon had won 17 games as a starter , and he decided to convert him , too . The Mets ' bull pen , a disaster one year ago , suddenly grew tough . <> <> Allen : ' Revved Up All the Time ' // The prodigies were asked to give scouting reports on themselves , and Allen replied : " I ' m kind of outspoken and offbeat , clowning around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he ' s all inside . " " Neil ' s got a great curveball , " Reardon said , " and a screwball personality . He should have been a lefty . We are extreme opposites . " " Emotionally , " Torre suggested , " Allen is close to Tug McGraw . He ' s revved up all the time on the mound and if anybody gets a hit off him he wants to strangle the guy . He lost five games in a row when he was a rookie and sat crying in the locker room . I never saw that before. " // After his rookie season , Allen had no winter speaking engagements . But after last season , when his moods seemed part of an effervescent personality , he was booked for appearances almost every night. // " Neil doesn ' t pull outrageous practical jokes like Tug McGraw , " said Herb Norman , the Mets ' equipment manager . " But he radiates emotion . Reardon is still water running deep . Allen keeps his sadness to himself but shares his happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
