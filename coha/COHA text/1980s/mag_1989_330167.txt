For the third time in this century the old order is crumbling in Europe , and the world waits anxiously for a new one to be born . The transition promises to be long , difficult and hazardous . But rarely if ever has the vision of a peaceful and relatively free Europe stretching from the Atlantic to the Urals seemed so palpably within grasp . Thus 1989 is destined to join other dates in history  --  1918 and 1945  --  that schoolchildren are required to remember , another year when an era ended , in this case the 44-year postwar period , which is closing with the rapid unraveling of the Soviet empire . <P> Because events in Eastern Europe sometimes appear to be spinning out of control , the need grows more urgent to perceive and outline even the vaguest contours of the reshaped Continent to come . The crumbling of Communism in the East carries risks that might be avoided and offers opportunities to choose policies most likely to bring stability to a new European order . <P> Accordingly , TIME invited five experts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hungarian , a Frenchman , a West German and an American  --  to try and give definition to what Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev calls " the common European house . " During a six-hour meeting last week at an 18th century mansion in Brussels , the " capital " of the twelve-nation European Community , the group was asked to share insights on the future of Europe . The panel was not always in agreement but found consensus on some basic points : <P>  --  Gorbachev 's unprecedented attempt to democratize Communism and his drive for economic reform or perestroika have brought the Soviet Union to the brink of breakdown . As popular frustration rises , recourse to some form of more autocratic rule  --  either under Gorbachev or a successor  --  is increasingly possible . <P>  --  Instability is likely to prevail in Eastern Europe for years to come , but for all its problems , the region has a far better chance of building democratic institutions and a market economy than the Soviet Union , which lags decades behind its former satellites . <P>  --  The reunification of Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial threat in 19th century balance-of-power terms  --  but only if reunification is achieved within a European framework . <P>  --  The U.S.  --  and NATO  --  still has a major role to play in Europe , especially before more sweeping arms-control agreements come into force and before a new political equilibrium is established on the Continent . <P>  --  Western Europe should not be tempted into slowing or diluting its program of economic integration scheduled to culminate in 1992 . The European Community must remain a beacon and a model for reformist leaderships in the East . <P>  --  Eastern Europe 's emergence from 40 years of isolation may well come at the expense of the Third World , which will see Western concern and capital flows diverted to the transition from Communism . <P>  --  With the winding down of the cold war , national power will no longer be measured in military terms but in shares of world markets and in technological achievement .
