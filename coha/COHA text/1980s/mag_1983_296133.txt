A hat has the effect of making the human head a kind of residence . It gives the brain a dome and porch roof , and a strange little portable sense of place . It is a wonderful spot to look out from under , a sort of individual estate . A man feels at home in a hat , established . But wearing a hat is also like having the FBI set you up with a new identity in a different city . It can change you . <P> The subject here is the serious hat . Not the " fun " hat . Not the Greek fisherman 's hat . The writer Roy Blount Jr . has correctly remarked that no man should ever wear a Greek fisherman 's hat who is not 1 ) Greek and 2 ) a fisherman . In the same spirit , it is probably true that no man should wear a cowboy hat who is not 1 ) a cowboy or 2 ) President of the United States . <P> The serious hat is not a masquerade , not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like a middle-aged New York City account executive , he harbors a West Texan in his soul , the real interior galoot made manifest in the feathered Stetson that sits on the bar . The serious hat is the opposite of a disguise . It is a working piece of clothes and an adjunct of character . <P> Freud implied that a man putting on a hat was performing a phallic gesture . One historian of costume , James Laver , remarked that " epochs of extreme male domination have coincided with high hats for men . " What does that tell us about Abraham Lincoln ? Well , Freud is also said to have conceded that a cigar is sometimes merely a cigar . <P> But a hat does have psychological power . A man places the thing just on top of his brain , and the one takes emanations from the other . The ancient Egyptians would go to parties in an ornamental cone of perfumed wax . The wax would melt down onto the wearer as the party heated up . The hat responded to the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can also be dangerous : no other article of clothing has the potential to make a man look so ridiculous . There is the terror of the whisper : Why does he wear that silly little hat ? <P> The first problem that serious hats and hatters face is that most men tend to think they look idiotic wearing one . That is often true , but need not be . Fred Astaire may be God 's best human design for a serious hat ( or for something more problematic , like the straw boater ) . But even short fat men , who think that serious hats turn them into Nikita Khrushchev , can usually find one that makes them look better than they deserve . Oddly , women often wear men 's hats more handsomely than men do . <P> The second problem facing hatters is that , except in a metaphysical sense , the hat is far less necessary than it once was . Men confront the elements only briefly , as they walk through the parking lot . So hats and hatters live at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Off with their hats !

Then it is sighted only occasionally , resting , say , on Tom Wolfe 's head , or disappearing down the street on the pate of a doddering banker . But it usually somehow struggles back . Fashion makes great lazy circles in time .
