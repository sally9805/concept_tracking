txt Airline bonus games are staging a comeback . The games , which reward frequent fliers with free air travel or discounts , were early casualties - last month when the air-traffic controllers went on strike . As a result of the strike and the accompanying confusion , passengers scrambled to get any flight they could , and the " brand loyalty " that the games were supposed to inspire was diffused . But now that passengers are adjusting to the new airline schedules , which represent a 25% cutback from pre-strike-levels , frequent fliers are going back to their favorite airlines . The bonus games began in May , when American Airlines started its American Advantage program . American offers passengers who log 50,000 miles in 12 months a first-class round-trip ticket to anywhere the airline flies . American 's plan was copied by other airlines , and many of them sweetened the pot . Some securities analysts who follow the airline industry are skeptical about the games , and some players find that their employers wo n't let them keep the prizes for themselves . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. Plaskett , declares : " This is one of the most popular promotions we 've run . The response has been extraordinary . " Others Come Aboard United , TWA , Continental , Northwest Orient , Braniff , Texas International and Western have all joined in . " It 's like banks giving away ' toasters , " says Neil Effman , TWA 's senior vice president for airline planning . " One bank does it and everybody else has to . " Pan American World Airways , which is cutting fares sharply on all its domestic flights , also will offer a two-for-one promotion starting Monday and running through Oct. 24 . Any passenger who buys a ticket for a Pan Am trip in the continental U.S. during that period can use the ticket stub and a special boarding pass to buy two tickets for the price of one to any of 13 locations abroad . The foreign trips must be made between Oct. 25 and May 31 , but the holiday period of Dec. 15 to Jan. 15 is excluded . Destinations include West Germany , Australia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Travelers using the bonus tickets must be members of the same family as the purchasers . Players must sign up in advance to participate in most of the games . American Airlines automatically enrolled all members of its Ambassador Club and signed up other players through travel agents . Most of the other airlines took out advertisements in newspapers and in magazines read by frequent flyers . TWA , which lost passengers when it refused to go along with the half-fare coupon plan initiated by United in 1979 , has apparently learned its lesson . Not only did TWA match programs announced by American and United , but also it raised the ante . TWA offers a first-class ticket to anywhere in the U.S. or Europe for 50,000 domestic miles , and two economy tickets to Europe for 60 , - 000 miles . Neither United nor American flies to Europe , so both airlines are playing up the prospect of free trips to Hawaii . A player can aim , for intermediate goals under the American , TWA and United plans . On American , 12,000 miles earns one firstclass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discount on any ticket , and 30,000 miles earns a 50% discount . Smaller Lines ' Plans Carriers with smaller domestic-route systems have devised their own formulas , some of them quite complicated . With fewer domestic routes , " we 'd be at a disadvantage if we had a mileage program , " explains Thomas , Continental 's director of commercial-sales planning . So Continental chose a point system , awarding passengers a certain number of points for each flight . A Los Angeles to El Paso trip , for example , is worth 106 points , while Los Angeles to Indianapolis and Boston are worth 400 points and 500 points , respectively . For each 1,000 points accumulated , the traveler receives $285 of transportation on Continental . Braniff has a similar point system . Nine major carriers have joined in o ftering special fare promotions . " It 's like banks giving away toasters , " says Neil Effman , a TWA senior vice president . " One bank does it and everybody else has to . " Perhaps the most generous program was announced in July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any 10 domestic flights worth more than $75 each . Northwest " is giving away the store , " said Mark Lambrecht , United 's direct-marketing and promotions manager . Mr. Lambrecht worries that the major carriers " may have opened a Pandora 's box " and may have to increase their prizes to stay competitive with the smaller airlines . United 's " mileage plus " program is already offering double-mileage credit for flights between the Pacific Northwest and California because of competition from Western 's $50 travel pass , which gives fliers $50 worth of travel for five flights . Analysts Are Skeptical " It would take an accountant to figure out which program is best , " says Bill Single , an agent at Getz International Travel 's San Francisco office . One of the securities analysts who are skeptical about the programs , Robert J. Joedicke of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb , says : " I 'd be surprised if most businessmen would go to the trouble of filling out forms , keeping track of their mileage , and sending things in . If somebody is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited about a free trip to someplace else . " Still , each of the airlines offering a program'claims hundreds of thousands of players . H.R. , a partner in a major San Francisco law firm , signed up for the American , TWA , United and Western programs , though he does most of his flying on TWA . How does he deal with all the paper work involved ? " I give the stuff to my secretary and she keeps track of it for me , " Mr. says . The airlines are counting on frequent fliers ' concentrating on the game they feel they have the best chance of winning . Don Youngs , a Dallas management consultant , has signed up for the American and Braniff programs but is concentrating on American because that 's the line he normally uses most . " If you play both of them equally hard , you get nothing from either , " he says . Mr. Youngs has already accumulated more than 50,000 miles on American . " My wife and I have already made reservations for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , counting on racking up 50,000 more miles before then . Employers Spoil Fun Mr. Youngs is fortunate . His firm , Spencer Stuart &; Associates , allows employes who fly on business to keep any prizes they win . Some other companies are n't so generous . International Harvester and Boeing require employes to turn in any benefits to the company 's travel department . " Boeing 's paying for their tickets in the first place , " a company spokesman says . " It 's just fair that the benefits accrue to Boeing . " But some employes of companies with policies similar to International Harvester 's and Boeing 's are apparently cheating . " Our first winner did n't want his name publicized because he was flying on company business " and wanted to keep the prize for himself , says Ray Chanaud , Braniff 's vice president for public relations . " We tried to take his picture , but he would n't let us . " Airline-industry observers doubt whether the bonus-flight programs will generate any new traffic for the airline system , which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might redistribute passengers , " says Eva Davis Holman , an analyst at Donaldson , Lufkin &; Jenrette . " I suspect that passengers will tend to drift toward airlines that offer the most routes , " such as United and American . That 's what American 's Mr. Plaskett is counting on . " Brand loyalty is a laudable objective , but what I 'm really after is for a person to take one more trip on my airline than on someone else 's , " he says . Apparently , it 's working . Mr. Youngs , the Dallas consultant says , " I 'd get up an hour and a half earlier if I had to , to catch a flight on American . " But he has his limits : " If I had to loiter around O'Hare " in Chicago , the nation 's busiest airport , " I 'd take the most convenient flight . "
