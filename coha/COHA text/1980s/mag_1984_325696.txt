Conservatives change the course of a federal panel <P> For a brief moment last week it seemed that the members of the new Commission on Civil Rights might banish whatever bitterness they harbored from last year 's skirmishes and stand together . The commissioners answered Democrat Walter Mondale and others who criticized them as puppets of the Reagan Administration with a blunt statement : " The commission belongs to no one . . . and will serve no political ideology or special interest . That is the meaning of our independence . It is uncompromisable . " <P> That promising display of solidarity , however , was soon overshadowed by a blitz of controversial decisions and internal struggles . At a two-day session in Hunt Valley , Md. , the new commission 's conservative majority dominated the liberal members . By a 5-to-3 vote , the group decided to cancel an investigation of how cutbacks in student financial aid affected colleges where most students were black or Hispanic , and by a 6-to-2 vote , it came out against the Detroit police department 's use of numerical quotas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy over the commission first erupted last May , when President Reagan replaced three members with appointees who shared his opposition to racial quotas and busing . " We wanted our own people , " said White House Counsellor Edwin Meese . Two of the sacked members , Mary Frances Berry and Blandina Cardenas Ramirez , sued in federal court for an injunction forbidding their removal , arguing that the action violated the commission 's legal status as an independent body . More than 30 Senators and 19 Representatives lined up to sponsor a bipartisan resolution to have commission members appointed by Congress rather than by the President . After much negotiating , a compromise was reached : the new Civil Rights Commission would have eight members , four to be appointed by the President and four by Congress . Berry and Ramirez retained their positions , but the lineup resulted in a conservative majority . <P> Berry and Ramirez were the dissenters in the 6-to-2 vote that opposed the affirmative-action plan of the Detroit police department . The commission 's statement deplored the use of quotas , saying that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal rights to majority groups . <P> Said Reagan Appointee Morris Abram , a prominent Democratic lawyer : " Nothing will ultimately divide a society more than this kind of reverse discrimination . " <P> In a lively news conference at the end of the Hunt Valley meeting , Berry confronted Abram and Chairman Clarence Pendleton Jr. , an earlier Reagan appointee who had been in a conservative minority on the old commission . Said Pendleton : " I sat at this commission for 18 months and got beat up all kinds of ways . .. Now the new members are here , and we are going to do the best job we can for the American citizens . " Berry , who could hardly conceal her disdain for the chairman , said that the commission " is no longer the conscience of America on civil rights " and added , " I despair for women and minorities in this country .
