Winslow felt the weight of his years as he climbed heavily out of the dusty coach in front of the Mote Hall . He moved stiffly down the narrow lane that led to Pastor Gifford 's cottage , speaking briefly to those who greeted him . The brilliant May sunshine painted the thatched roofs of the village with gold , but he had no eye for the beauty of the lush countryside that day . I 'm like an old dog looking for a place to die , he thought wearily , then paused abruptly , for he had been a man of great zest , and the discovery that he had given up swept over him . He stood stock-still in the middle of the street , unaware of the whitewashedhouses of Bedford or the noisy flock of geese crossing the village green like a snowy cloud . He suddenly remembered the day he had stood on the deck of the Mayflower , just off Southampton , with Pastor Robinson  --  now dead . That day with the small band of believers , they had looked their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the sea . A lump rose in his throat as thoughts of them  --  Standish , Alden , Mullins , Bradford , and Captain Christopher Jones ! All gone now  --  and I 'm not far behind . " Mr. Winslow ! " A voice caught at him , interrupting his reminiscing . As he turned he saw Pastor Gifford approaching from the square with his nephew . " You 're two days late , " Gifford saidp51as he came to take Winslow 's hand . " We 've been concerned . " " Every coach was full for two days after the King arrived from France . " He shook his head sadly . " I 'd have been most happy to leave earlier . " " Come , Uncle , " Matthew said quickly , noting his evident fatigue . " These coach rides are enough to make a man take to his bed . I 'll accompany you to Pastor Gifford 's house . You can tell us the news on the way . " " I think I will take a little rest , Matthew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led along the street by Matthew 's gentle pressure . He said little as they made their way past the first group of cottages north of the Mote Hall , but gave a sigh of relief as they came to the small cottage of the pastor . " Wife ! " Gifford called out as they crossed the threshold , " We have a guest . " Gifford 's wife Sarah , a short , heavy-set woman of fifty , turned from the massive fireplace , her face lighting up at the sight of the older man . " Ah now , I 've been cooking for you for two days ! Sit you down , and you can have these meat pies I 've had to fight my husband and your nephew for ! " " Yes , sit down , Edward , " Gifford urged , pulling a heavy chair back from the table . " Sit you down , too , " he said to the younger Winslow . " You can lie down after you 've eaten , Edward , but first , tell us about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's the whole of it , " Winslow said heavily . He reached into his inner pocket , fumbled around briefly , then pulled a letter out . " A letter from your fa-ther . " As Matthew opened the letter , he heard Pastor Gifford saying , " Well , we knew it was coming , did n't we ? " " Yes , we knew it . " Winslow leaned forward , placed his brow on his fist and closed his eyes . " Aye , we knew it , John  --  but I do n't think any of us really have any idea of what it 's going to be like . " " In that you are probably right , " Gifford said slowly . " It 'll be a dark night of the soul for our people . " As the two older men spoke of the new order and the problemsit would bring to their small world , Matthew read the brief lines :  |p524  March 1660My son Matthew , Your request that we travel to England to meet your new bride is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fear you do not yet understand how ill your mother is . She is almost completelybedfast now , and I must stay at home to take care of her , except for those times when the neighbors sit with her . I do not even dare go to preach overnight at any of the9,11 , churches , for fear she will be gone when I return . She is quite ready to go home to the Lord . This morning when one of the good ladies asked her if she had any fear , she roused up , andher eyes had the same fire they had when I first saw her , andshe said right smartly , " Afraid ? How could I be afraid to go to Him whom I have loved and longed for these fifty years ! " She had memorized your letters word for word and only wishes that she might have seen your bride . But what has meant the most to her  --  and to me , my son !  --  is the portion of the last letter where you indicated your intention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your uncle in which he speaks of your interest in preaching along with good MasBunyan , have been the joy of her heart , and mine also . When we parted , Matthew , I said , " Be true to God and toyourself . " I can add nothing to that , except that your mother and I have great faith now in you , and that if we do not meet again on this earth , we will be reunited in a better Kingdom ! Gilbert WinslowMatthew blinked rapidly , his eyes burning as he read thelines , and he bit his lip as he folded the letter and stored it in his pocket . He had been over-hasty in his marriage , he knew , and the guilt of it bore heavily on him . The original plan had been for a trip to Plymouth with Lydia so she might meet his parents , then marry there . But there had been such objections from Martha Smith over Lydia making such a voyage in an unstatethat they had given up on the idea . " We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowing something of thepain he felt . But the trip was long and expensive . So the fivemonths of their marriage had served only to increase the pain Matthew felt over his parents . He shook off the thought and heard his uncle speaking of " the restoration of Charles to the throne . " The whole country isone big ball , John . You should have seen the excitement whenCharles came ashore day before last ! He came in a barge with two dukes . Mr. Pepys was with him , and the captain of thep53brigantine steered . There was also Mr. Mansell and a dog the king loves  --  and many others from his nest in France . A large crowd was there to meet him , including General Monk , who fell on him with all imaginable love and respect , thousands of horsemenit seemed , and noblemen of all sorts . The mayor of the town presented him his white staff , the badge of his place , which the King gave him again . " He gave a short laugh and a sardonic light came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John , the mayor gave him a very rich Bible , which he took and said , holding it up , ' This is what I love more than anything else in the world ! ' " " You do n't think he meant it ? " Matthew asked . " Meant it ? Him , with his fancy French whores in his cabin on the ship he 'd just left ? " Winslow shook his head violently and struck the table with a clenched fist . " The man 's an actor , I tell you ! Now it pleases him to play the benevolent monarch , forgiving his enemies  --  but mark my word , within months the gallows in England will bear the weight of those who were closest to Cromwell . " " What about you , Edward ? " Gifford asked quickly . " I would not be at all surprised to find myself among those pinpointed by Charles . " " But  --  you wo n't stay here , will you , Uncle ? " Matthew asked . " Stay here ? Of course I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of me that I 'd sell out what I 've lived for just to have a few more hours on this earth ! " " That 's very well for you , Edward , " Gifford nodded . " But I think for your nephew it might be best to return to Plymouth . " " I agree , " the old man said . " Well , I do n't ! " The face of young Winslow flushed and there was a stubbornness in the set of his chin that brought a sudden image of Gilbert Winslow to the older man . He watched as Matthew got to his feet and paced the confines of the small room in agitation , his trim figure alive with nervous energy . " What sort of man do you take me for ? A coward ? " " Now , Matthew , there 's no question of that , " Gifford soothed . He had grown accustomed to the quick , impulsive shifts in the young man 's behavior , so now he reasoned with him carefully . " First of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't your battle  --  except perhaps in prayer . Secondly , you are not alone now . If you were single , that might be a different story , but as Mr. Bacon has said , ' He that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune . ' You must consider Lydia . And thirdly , you must have been under constant burden concerning your mother . You must see that going back to Plymouth would be the wise thing to do . " " Perhaps so , but you forget one thing , " Matthew responded quickly . " You and I have had long talks , have we not , about my preaching ? Am I to leave that , too ? And do n't tell me there 's preaching to be done at Plymouth , Pastor Gifford ! I will quote you one scripture , and you tell me how I may without peril to my soul ignore it : ' He that putteth his hand to the plow and turneth back , is not fit for the kingdom of God ! ' " Pastor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he gave a short laugh and threw up his hands . " I leave him to you , Edward ! " " Well , that 's no good , either , " Edward smiled , and for that moment the lines of his face softened and he looked much like the young man before him . " The Winslows have always been fool-stubborn , and I see this one is no different . His father is that way himself  --  and so am I , I suppose . " Matthew stood there , so tall that his head almost brushed the rough beam over his head . He smiled down at Gifford . " It would be so much easier if it were a real war with swords and pikes , would n't it ? Just go out slashing and hacking  --  then you either killed or got killed . But this is n't like that , is it ? " " No , our weapons are not carnal , but mighty to God to the pulling down of strongholds , " Gifford stated emphatically . " And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realm of England will be set to crush every Puritan and Separatist to powder , and very soon . " There was a silence as Gifford 's wife came to the table with trenchers full of meat . " Well , " the younger man said , " Lydia is expecting me . " He took his uncle 's hand . " You 'll come to our house for supper tomorrow night , will you , sir ? " " Done ! " " Good day , then . I 'll read the book by Mr. Hooker before our study tomorrow , Pastor . "  |p55He  left the room hurriedly , and as the two men began to cat , Edward asked , " What 's your judgment , John , on that young man ? " Gifford chewed a morsel of meat slowly , swallowed , then said , " He 's either going to be a great man  --  " He paused , then with a shrug of his narrow shoulders , finished by saying , " He 's got the raw material , Edward , but the crucible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out . " " It would kill Gilbert and Humility if he failed , " Edward remarked with sadness in his old eyes . " He 's all that 's left of the House of Winslow , is n't he ? If he goes down , it 'll be like there never were any of us . " " No ! He wo n't go down ! " Pastor Gifford said suddenly , his usually mild expression twisted to an explosive anger . " This king may think to wipe us out , but he shall not do it , not by all that 's holy ! You and I have fought , but we are old . It 'll be young men like your nephew who 'll have to stand in the gap this time ! " " Amen ! " Edward Winslow agreed loudly . Then he looked at the door and said in a prayerful whisper , " Amen ! " The tiny house on the edge of town was like a doll 's house , having only one room for cooking , dining , eating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight feet square for sleeping . It had been used by one of the deacons , Matthew Prince , as a storage shed for his blacksmithing equipment , but he had agreed to rent it to the newlyweds very cheaply . It had been a delightful game for the pair , cleaning out the rooms , finding a few pieces of furniture and fitting them into every possible location . They set up housekeeping with a weddinggift from Edward Winslow , a small bag of gold sovereigns . " If it had n't been for your uncle Edward , we 'd be roosting on a tree ! " Lydia had laughed once as they tried to put a sideboard along a wall that was only two inches longer than the massive piece of oak furniture . He had dropped the end he was struggling with , picked her up in his arms and covered her face with kisses , crying out , " I 'd rather have a woman like you roosting in a tree than any other in a castle ! " " Matthew ! " she had cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes as she pretended to pout . She had always been a romantic girl  --  far too much so for her aunt 's tastes . Perhaps it was the French blood . In any case , she had somehow been able to maintain a balance between an inner life alive with imagination and the rigid creed and austere practices of the Pilgrim way . She had learned while very young to act out little dramas she made up only when alone , but even when she ceased to pantomime such things , she kept up a lively imagination . Those little dramas had been buried deep inside , but she had learned almost at once that the man she had married was at least as romantic as she , although he denied it vehemently . To outsiders , Matthew and Lydia seemed a rather conventionalyoung married couple . She tended her tiny house , sewed , cooked , and sat demurely by her tall , handsome husband through the four-hour sermons , and he went faithfully to work with the dusty books of Asa Goodman , looking as solemn as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage , their behaviorwould have been a scandal to the neighbors , not to mention the deacons and pastors ! They both had playful minds , and their verbal give-and-take , puns and jokes that would have been meaningless to anyone else , was a source of constant delight to both of them . Even now as he walked to the door and stepped inside , his heart beat a little faster at the thought of her . She met him at once , throwing her arms around him and pulling his head down for a kiss . They stood there for a long moment , savoring each other . Then he stepped back and pulled the letter from his pocket . " Uncle Edward is back . He brought a letter from Father . " She read it quickly , then looked up with apprehension . " It sounds very serious . " " I think it is . Father is n't given to idle words . " She bit her lower lip , then said quietly , " You feel very bad , do n't you ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then seeing her face grow tense , he took her in his arms and added , " Now , do n't you fret , Princess . It just could n't be . " " Do you think we should go now ? "  |p57He  released her and sat down on the single bench in the room . " Uncle Edward and Pastor Gifford say we should go . Notjust because of Mother 's illness , but they think there 's going to be hard times for all of us . " She nodded and sat down next to him . Taking his hand in hers , she spoke softly . " And what do you say , dear ? " He shook his head stubbornly , an expression she had learned to recognize . " I say we stay here . Where in America is there a man like Pastor Gifford or John Bunyan to sit under ? " " All right , we stay ! " she cried out ; then she jumped up and ran to the fireplace . " Oh , I 've burned the potatoes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Forget the potatoes ! Here I 'm trying to make the most important decision of our lives , and you 're worried about burned potatoes ! " " And you 'll be screaming like a madman when I put them in front of you for supper ! " she laughed . " Madman I may be , but not over burned potatoes  --  just you , " he returned , grabbing her and whirling her around the room . " Oh , Princess , " he said , holding her tightly , " I did n't know love could be so wonderful . " He looked into her glowing face and kissed her tenderly . " My love , I  --  " " Good day , Brother Winslow . " Matthew loosed his grip on Lydia so suddenly that she almostslipped to the floor , then both of them stood there with their faces flaming , staring at John Bunyan and Elizabeth , who had come up to the front door . " Oh  --  " Matthew stammered . " Why , Brother Bunyan , come in  --  we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of ringlets that had fallen wildly over her shoulders and moved toward Elizabeth . " Come in . Matthewand I were just discussing our future ! " " It 's a joy to see young love . I hope you 're enjoying each other like this when you 've been married as long as some of us ! " He put his arm around his wife and smiled down at her . Then he asked , " Well , Matthew , will you be going with me tomorrow to preach at Hinton ? " " Of course . " " Good ! " Bunyan gave the young man a smile . " I think youp58might say a few words this time , Matthew . " " You mean  --  preach ? " Bunyan smiled at his expression . " You have to begin , do n't you ? We all do . Come , Elizabeth , we must go . " " He 's a wonderful man , " Lydia murmured , watching them walk away . " So simple . " " Yes , but he 's a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departing pair . " Four children ! And expecting another ! Elizabeth'sfirst  --  and he may be in jail or deported . How can he face up to that ? " Lydia took his arm and said quietly , " We must pray , Matthew . And we must cling very close together . You know what I fear most ? " " What ? " " Not jail or persecution , but that we 'll be somehow di-vided . " " How could that be , Princess ? " he asked gently . " I would never leave you . " She stood there staring out at the disappearing forms of the Bunyans and seemed to be struck by something in their figures . " I do n't know how , but it 's what I fear . Do n't let it happen , Matthew ! " she cried , throwing herself into his arms . " Never ! " Matthew stated , smoothing her hair . " Let the world fall , you and I will stay together . " She put her head back and looked up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want , Matthew . It 's not too much to ask , is it ? We may miss out on the world , but we can ask God to give us that one thing , ca n't we ? Is that too selfish to ask Him for  --  to let us stay together as long as we 're on this earth ? " " No , not too much . " He led her back inside the small , dark cottage and pulled the door , shutting out the outside world with all its clamor and demands . And as it closed with a firm sound , he found himself wishing that it could be as easy as this always  --  just leave the world , find a snug hiding place with the one you love , and shut the door . But as he turned to her uplifted face , he felt a wave of fatalismgrip him . A cloud crossed the sun , cutting off the bright rays and leaving her a vague and indistinct shadow as she stood before him.  |p59Justice  Twisten lived in the largest house in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large chimneysrising high above the eaves . Plumes of white smoke rolled out of them , caught by the sharp September wind and twisted into a braided column against the iron-gray sky . Summer 's emeraldgreen lay buried under a dull covering of dead leaves that crunched briskly under the feet of the three men marching down the long lane from the main road . John Bunyan glanced at his companions , then lifted his gaze to the house which lay in the circle of a serpentine drive . " I wish your uncle were here with us , Matthew . He 's used to talking with lawyers and government people . " " There 's not much even he could do this time , John , even if he were able to come , " Pastor Gifford responded . " I have no hope of any mercy from Twisten . He 's always hated our faith . " Bunyan scraped the mud off his feet on the brick steps and grimaced as he gave the brass knocker a loud blow . " No , I suppose that 's true . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Very poorly . " Anger flew across Matthew 's face as he thought of his uncle jammed into a common jail in London . " He has weak lungs and that cold cell could be the death of him . " The Winslow blood flared up and he struck the moss-covered bricks with a clenched fist . " Curse them ! An old man like thatp60who 's served his country all his life ! " " But they 'll never forget he served Cromwell , " Pastor Giffordreminded them . " I hear the jails are packed with Fifth-Monarchymen and Separatists , but  --  " He broke off as the door opened and he announced , " We are called to see Justice Twis-ten . " " He 's waiting for you , " the tall , thin man who answered the door said . He led them across a large open room , down a broad corridor lined with a series of portraits of stern-faced men . " In here , please . " The three men stepped into a large book-lined study , dominated by a massive desk behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , portly man with a neck of a bull , his small eyes buried in the folds of fat lining his face . He offered no greeting . Pastor Gifford waited for a moment , then seeing that the man was not going to speak , said , " You sent for us , Justice Twis-ten ? " Still he waited , the antagonism in his piggish eyes gleaming ; then he said abruptly , " You know why you 've been sent for , Gifford . We 'll have no discussion ! " His high voice rose , incongruous in such a bulky form , and his fat face flushed as he added , " You are lawbreakers , and I 'll have none of it in this country . " " Sir , if I might  --  " " None of your smooth talk , I said ! You have been told of the Conventicle Act , and you can spare me your pleas for mercy . The law is plain ; it forbids the assembly of more than five people for any religious gathering . " He glared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bunyan , are a known felon ! " " I am no felon ! " " Quiet ! " Twisten roared . He heaved his bulk out of the chair and stood there , massive and dangerous , " You have been preaching at night to groups of people  --  we have information on this . And I warn you , Bunyan , if you are apprehended , you are subject to the full weight of the law ! " " Surely , Justice Twisten , " Gifford objected , " you would not classify a few simple preachers with murderers and thieves ! " " The law , Gifford , the law does the classifying ! " Twisten shot back as he leaned forward like a huge bear , resting his fistsp61on the desk and glaring at the three of them . " The same law that throws an old man like my uncle in jail with common murderers ? " Matthew raised his voice and took a step toward the justice in a move so unexpected that Twisten straightened up and stepped backward , alarm on his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyranny ! " " Matthew ! " Gifford warned , taking a firm grip on the young man 's arm , but he was too late . Twisten wheeled and moved across the room surprisingly fast for such a big man . He threw open the door and shouted , " Matthew Winslow , is it ? You will join your famous uncle the moment I hear one word of your defying the Act ! Now get out , all of you ! I called you here to tell you that I am set against you ! You had your way with the true servants of the King while that traitor Cromwell lived  --  now we 'll see who will bend their necks to the Royal Monarch , King Charles the Second ! Get out ! " Matthew made to move toward the justice , but his arms were pinned at once by Gifford and Bunyan . As they struggled to get him outside the door , he cried out with a ringing voice , " You godless dog ! Put me in the jail ! I 'll stay there until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give in to you ! " He was still raging as they cleared the front door . " You young fool ! What good did that do ? " Bunyan said roughly as he jerked the young man so hard his neck popped . " You expect me to stand there and listen to that  --  ! " " Shut your mouth ! " Bunyan interrupted fiercely . As soon as they were clear of the drive and back on the main road , he released Matthew and turned to walk rapidly toward the center of town , Gifford joining him . Matthew stood transfixed , then hurried to catch up with the two men who ignored him , speaking quietly only to each other . " No hope for mercy from Twisten , just as I said , " Pastor Gifford said despondently . He gave a quick sideways glance at the burly tinker beside him . " What will you do , John ? " " What God tells me to do ! " " But you know the end of that  --  I mean , if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Bunyan did not look at Gifford . His eyes were fixed on the horizon where small groups of scudding clouds broke the mo/notony of the gray sky . He seemed to be lost in thought and it was not until they were abreast the field where the lane turned to his cottage that he stopped and turned his eyes on Gifford and Winslow . " I 'm afraid , Pastor . " " You  --  afraid ? " Matthew asked in surprise . Never had a man seemed so filled with total dedication as John Bunyan , and he could not believe what the tall preacher was saying . " Yes , I 'm afraid , " Bunyan said simply . He smiled slightly , and his eyes were fixed on Winslow . " You 've often told me what a good imagination I have , Matthew . " " Yes ? " " Well , I do have more of that than most men , but it 's a curse  --  at least in this case . " He brushed his hand across his face in an odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisiblecobwebs . When he lowered his hand there was a vulnerabilityin his strong face that Matthew had never seen before . " Every night I have this dream  --  always the same . I 'm in a cell , a dirty , dank cell with filth everywhere . And in the dream I 've been there so long I ca n't remember when I came there , and there 's no end to it ! Every night is an eternity stretching out to the crack of doom  --  but that 's not the worst ! " " What is it , John ? " Gifford asked quietly . " It 's my family  --  my wife and children . " Bunyan brushed his hand across his eyes , and when he looked up Matthew saw they were filled with tears . " I hear them outside the cell , crying  --  especially Mary  --  oh , the thought of my blind one , what she may endure , breaks my heart to pieces ! " His companions stood there helplessly . Gifford glanced quickly at Matthew as if to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he said gently , " It 's asking too much  --  for a man with a family . Let the younger men do the front-line fighting , John . " " Stop preaching ? " " Just for a while . " " No ! Never . I spoke too quickly against you , Matthew , " he said with a faint smile . " I like what you told the justice ! What was it you said ? " He searched for it , then said , " ' I 'll stay there until moss grows up to my eyes . ' " He smiled and clapped Winslowp63on the back with a hearty blow . " That 's what you said  --  and it 's what I feel . " " But your family ? " Gifford protested . " What about them ? " " God will be the father of the fatherless ! " Bunyan exclaimed . He seemed to have shaken off the weight that had fallen on him . Squaring his shoulders , he looked fearlessly back toward Twisten'shouse . " God will not forsake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it'will be to His glory to be put in a cell , then by the grace of God that is what I will do ! " " Amen ! " Matthew cried . " And we will go to lower Samsell tomorrow just as we planned ? " " Yes ! Meet me at five . The people there will gather at the river , and we 'll preach in the dark if we have to ! " " I would not go if I were you , John , " Gifford spoke up . " Twisten is no fool . He 'll have you watched . " " Well  --  perhaps that 's so . " He thought of it , then said , " Scripture says that a wise man looketh well to his going . We will leave after dark , Matthew . That way we can be sure no one is following us . I 'm sure no one in the congregation will betray us . " " I 'll be there ! " Matthew exclaimed , afire with excitement . He waved quickly and ran off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't he , John ? " Gifford said with a fond glance at the young man . " He 's that . We could have used him in the Model Army . But this is going to be a different kind of war . If it were a matter of swords and gunpowder , Matthew would be the ideal warrior . That kind of hardship he could take . There 'd be plenty of danger and excitement  --  which is what he 's after . But his zeal is for adventures not for God . And this struggle is going to be different . Can he take persecution of another sort  --  jail , deportment , malice from high places ? " Gifford shook his head . " That would not be his strength , John . Until he truly comes to a personal faith , he wo n't be able to stand under it . We must try to keep him clear of it . " " We can try , but he 's young  --  and he 's got a cause . A holy war . " Bunyan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear scars from this , Pastor ! I pray young Winslow finds faith enough to support him ! " The two men fell into silence and made their separate ways home.  |p64Lydia  was caught off guard when Matthew came rushing in , his eyes blazing with excitement . She had been scrubbing the tiny floor of their single room when he burst through the door , crying out , " Lydia ! Come here ! " He seated her at the table and began pacing back and forth as he told her of the encounter with Justice Twisten and of the determination he had formed to join in the struggle against the tyranny of the crown . She smiled briefly , amused at the boyish quality of his excitement , but when he repeated Bunyan 's words , she sobered and raised a hand to interrupt him . " But , Matthew , you really are n't a preacher  --  not yet . " " Oh , I will be soon enough , " he said carelessly . " Sooner or later I 'll be accepted , and until that happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going tomorrow to Lower Samsell . I forgot to tell you . And we 'll have to go after dark  --  to shake off the sheriff 's men . " His eyes glowed at the thought , and he laughed aloud and pulled her to her feet . Lydia hesitated , then asked quietly , " Matthew , why are you doing this ? " He paused , arrested by the question , " Why  --  for honor , I suppose . Someone must stand against the tyranny of the King ! " " And for God ? " " Yes , I suppose ; for God as well ! " Catching her in his strong arms , he whirled her like a child . " Come on , you King 's men ! Try and catch us ! " She had sensed this reckless spirit in him from the first , and it had been part of his charm . There was something of the wild hawk in this spirit , something daring , and she loved that part of him . But a cloud fell over her face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " But , it 's very dangerous ! Sooner or later ... ? " He caught her hand up and kissed the palm . He looked so young as he stood there smiling down into her face . There was no cloud in his bright blue eyes . He was excited with the sheer adventure  --  much like at a game of chance or a closely fought contest with swords . Suddenly a fear shot through her , and she caught at him blindly , throwing her arms around his waist and holding on so tightly that he stopped short in surprise.  | " Why  --  what 's this ? " he asked . " You 're not afraid , are you , Princess ? " " For you I am , " she whispered , her voice trembling . " Why , you must n't be afraid , " he soothed , holding her close . " I can take care of myself . " He sounded so sure , so happy , and she drew back , dashing the tears away that had risen to her eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said with a serious look . She knew that his commitmentto God was not as strong as her own , and this troubled her . Always when she had thought about marriage she had thought of a man stronger than she , and in some ways he was . But his experience with God was superficial ; despite the capacity she sensed in him for a devout life of service , he had never been tested , never given himself to the arduous struggle of finding God in anything other than the ordinary ways . But she had . Bunyan ' s analysis had been accurate , for despiteher appearance ( her beauty caused some to think she was not at all spiritual ! ) and her rather flighty behavior at times , she had gone through a time that had brought her close to God . When her parents had died , she had been distraught , almost slipping off into derangement . No one knew how close she had come to losing her mind , but in that time of crisis , she had learned to pray  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Spirit . The strange people called the " Quakers " had risen about this time , led by George Fox , and all over England they had suffered persecution for their outlandish behavior . John Bunyan felt called to speak out against them , and was writing a book exposing what he perceived as doctrinal errors  --  one of them being a doctrine of " The Inner Light . " Although Lydia had no deep theological views , she had experienced something of the " inner light . " It had come suddenly , but only after long periods of desperate prayer . She had eaten little and would not have consciously called it " fasting , " but the experience came after several days of eating nothing . She had been alone in her room , lying across her bed , exhaustedby weeping and fear , and she cried out aloud , " Oh , God , I 'm so afraid ! Help me , please help me ! " And then she experienced something so different from anything she had ever known . She never forgot it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her poor , exhausted body suddenly seemed to be filled with light , accompanied by a sense of warmth that ran along her entireframe ! The fatigue and the stomachache that had plagued her immediately faded , and she felt warm and safe . Mostly safe , for that was her need . She had felt so alone ! For a long time  --  she never knew how long  --  she lay there resting in the warmth and sense of security . Then there came something into her mind that she could not understand . It was not a voice , and she heard nothing with her ears , but the words were there  --  deep inside , as if carved into her mind . Child , do you love me ? Would you let me into your heart ? Would you let me be in you forever ? With all her heart , Lydia yearned for love , for comfort and safety . She stretched her hands up as if reaching for her lost father 's comforting arms and cried out , " Yes ! Oh , yes , come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in . She could never explain it , nor did she ever try to . But it was like a door opened and someone came into the room , bringing health , joy , and peace inside ! She began to thank this Guest whose name she did n't know , lifting her small voice in praise . As she prayed , the presence of a mighty power filled her spirit , and she whispered , " Jesus , is it you ? " And in her heart there came an answer that swelled and grew until she could hardly bear it . Yes ! I am now in you , child ! She had lain there for a long time , knowing she was now different . Though she did n't immediately share this experience with anyone , one thing she quickly discovered : when she had troubles or fears , she could pray , and almost at once she was conscious of the presence of the Lord Jesus ! She longed to tell Matthew of this experience , but had not been able to do it . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her heart , she knew that he knew nothing of this kind of walk with God  --  and that frightened her . " Let 's pray , Matthew , " she said quietly . He looked at her in surprise . " You do the praying , Princess , " he laughed , " and I 'll do the rest . " Then he began talking excit/edly of the coming trip to Samsell , but failed to see the disappointmenton her face . He left the next night at dusk , and as he grabbed her in his arms and kissed her , his eyes gleamed with excitement . " Wait up for me , Princess ! " he whispered , kissing her fervently . " I 'll play the hare to these hounds of Twisten , and when I return , we 'll celebrate ! " " I 'll pray for you , " she said , fighting the fear that threatened to fill her . " Yes , you pray , " he said with a broad grin . Then he was gone . She went back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be hours before he came back , perhaps near dawn , but she was so burdened she fell on her knees and began praying with all her heart for him . She prayed until she was worn out , then fell asleep on the hard floor , one arm under her in a cramped position . When the loud knock came at daybreak , she aroused slowly , confused and heavy-eyed from sleep . " Lydia ! Lydia , wake up ! " She struggled to her feet , almost falling because of her numbed legs , and threw open the door . There stood Pastor Gifford  --  alone . She took one look at his face , then said quickly , " They 've been taken , have n't they ? " " Yes , both of them . " " I 'll get my cloak . " As she went slowly toward the small jail that sat perched on a bridge over the small stream , she listened quietly as Gifford told her how Bunyan and Matthew had been arrested and charged with breaking the law . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that never again would life be as simple as it had been when the sun had touched her face through the window that morning . The jail , which she had seen so often , suddenly seemed ominous , and a quick fear shot through her as they approached . But she called out , " God , be my helper ! " And as always , the peace came . Matthew will have to learn to pray ! she thought as she followed Pastor Gifford inside.  | " Elizabeth ? " Lydia knocked at the door of the Bunyan cottageand stood there shivering in the cutting November wind . She held a steaming iron pot by the handles , her hands almost numb from the icy cold that had fallen like a physical blow on the countryside . The door swung open and she stumbled stiff-legged into the room toward the small fire that flickered in the fireplace . " Mary , is your mother here ? " The blind eyes of the child swung toward her unerringly , and she said , " Yes , but she 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A look of alarm crossed Lydia 's face , and she said , " Well , I 've brought a pot of good strong beef broth . Why do n't you set the table while I go talk to her . " " Oh , that smells good ! " Mary shoved by the other children who had swarmed in close , looking like a miniature adult as she began setting the bowls on the table . As Lydia moved to the door that led to the sleeping room , she thought , Mary 's too young for such things . She 's never had a childhood . It disturbed her that the Separatists treated their children like adults . Her French father had been openly affectionate , and her mother had bent to his ways . The result had been a happy life while they lived , and ap69cruel shock when she had been taken into the strict world of her aunt . She moved in the dark sleeping chamber to the high bed and found Elizabeth on her back holding her stomach , her back arched rigidly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's forehead , whispering gently , " Elizabeth ? " The sick woman 's eyes opened slowly , and she moved to get up , saying feebly , " Oh , I  --  must have dozed off , Lydia . " Her face contorted suddenly with pain . " I must take John something to eat . " " No , you rest , " Lydia said , pressing her firmly back into the bed . " I 've made enough broth for all of us . I 'll take a big pot of it to John and Matthew . And I want you to eat all you can when you get up . " Elizabeth caught Lydia 's hand and held it to her face , saying softly , " I do n't know what I would have done without you , Lydia ! " She shook her head slowly , then said , " I want so much to have this baby  --  but it seems that everything 's gone wrong ! " " I know  --  but we must trust God . " Lydia pulled up the coversand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then paused and bit her lip . " I want to ask you something  --  do n't answer if you think it 's silly . " " It wo n't be silly , dear ! " " Well , I 've thought so much about my marriage , " she said slowly . " We were too hasty , Matthew and I. We should have waited at least until we could have seen his parents ! I wanted to , but Matthew was so insistent ! " She traced the design of the quilt that covered Elizabeth , then asked with some hesitation . " I  --  I 've been wondering , Elizabeth , about you and John , I mean  --  ? " " Why did I marry a man older than I with four children ? " " Yes ! " The lines of pain that etched Elizabeth 's face seemed to grow faint as she smiled , making her look younger . " You would n't believe how I fought against it , Lydia ! All my life I 'd had this dream of marrying some young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , and he 'd be successful ; then we 'd have a baby  --  and then perhaps one or two more in time . " She laughed then , and brushed her hair from her forehead . " Then came Johnp70Bunyan , with all his awkward ways and his four squalling children  --  oneof them blind ! What a time I had when I knew God wanted me to marry him and be the mother of his children ! " " How did you know that , Elizabeth ? " Lydia interrupted quickly . " How ? Why , I ca n't say , Lydia . I did n't hear a voice or anything like that  --  but I knew ! " She smiled and asked , " Do you think I 'd have married him in his condition if God had n't told me to ? No , somehow God let me know that my service for Him was to be tied up with John Bunyan , and that 's been my life . " She looked up at Lydia and asked , " You 've been having doubts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We married so quickly , and I thought that we had the same thoughts  --  but the last three months that Matthew 's been in jail have been  --  hard ! " " It would be hard for any man to endure that prison . " " Of course , but it 's doing something to Matthew ! " she said sadly . " Your husband is different . He 's been a soldier , and he 's had a hard life in many ways . But Matthew  --  why , he 's never had a trial in his wlxole life , Elizabeth ! " " But he 's so young ! " " Yes , that 's just it ! " Lydia shook her head in agitation and the problems she had struggled with overflowed as she said , " Maybe he 's too young for all this  --  and maybe we married too fast . I do n't know , but I can see him getting  --  he 's becoming bitter , Elizabeth ! You must have seen it ! " " Yes , I have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times . " " Last week he got so upset he  --  he blamed God for all the trouble ! " Lydia 's voice trembled and Elizabeth reached up and took her hand again . " He cursed and said that God was either asleep or did n't care what happened to men ! Oh , he caught himself , apologized to me . But it was his heart speaking  --  and I 'm afraid ! What 's going to happen to him , Elizabeth ? To us ? " Elizabeth asked quietly , " What was it you said to me a few moments ago , Lydia ? We must trust God . You will have to believe for Matthew until he can believe for himself . He must make it through this trial , for if he falls away now , he may never be God 's man ! "  |p71Elizabeth  's voice had grown strong and her grip bit into Lydia 's arm . " We must pray that at the trial , they 'll be set free . " " Yes , that 's been my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You must rest , Elizabeth  --  I 'll take the food to the prison . " " Come back and tell me how they are  --  and do n't tell John I 'm ill . Tell him I 'll be in tomorrow . " " All right . " Lydia returned to the large room , filled a smaller pewter pot with broth , wrapped a fresh loaf of brown bread in a cloth , and set out for the prison . It was not a great distance , but the sharp winds stung her unprotected face and hands like needles . There was a bite of sleet or snow in the air , and she shivered violently as she hurried along the frozen ground . Bedford was not noted for much , but its jail was the equal of any in England for a town that size . It sat beside the small river that touched the edge of town , a large two-story structure  --  three , counting the lower floor . The third floor held the rooms for Paul Cobb , the jailer , and his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , and was separatedfrom the rest of the space by solid iron bars . The lower floor , or basement , was used for prisoners as well , but it was so damp , being on practically the same level as the river , that only when the first floor was filled was it used . Fortunately , the number of prisoners had been low since the beginning of winter , so the twenty or so prisoners were kept in the more comfortable section of the prison . " Comfortable " was a relative term , since there was no fire of any sort to take the chill off the prisoners . They wore all the clothing they could get , and moved around like huge , fat bears in the confined space of their common cell . Two single windows set high in the wall let in light and air as well as snow and rain , and one set of double windows  --  heavily barred , of course  --  was set low enough in the wall so that by standing on tiptoe or on one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town  --  or from the other side , a view of the river . In early fall , this was pleasant enough , and there was keen competition for the space . But during the winter the freezing winds piled sleet and snow several inches deep inside the cell.  |p72Evervone  slept in every thread they could put on , and under all the bedclothes they could lay hands on . The bare stone floor , overed by a few wisps of straw , grew more evil-smelling day by day . Paul Cobb , a thick-set , balding man , came down the stairs at Lydia 's call , and as he opened the door , he growled , " Ye 'd best be sayin ' a word to thot hoosband ' o yours , Lydia Winslow . " I le pulled the massive door open and added as Lydia stepped through , " He had quite a row with old Jamison last night ! I had to step in and keep him from wipin ' up the floor wif the old man ! Ye 'd best have a word with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called out , " Winslow , here 's yer wife  --  maybe she can talk some sense into yer head ! " Lydia caught sight of Matthew at once , but he made no move to come to her . He was standing at one of the windows , staring moodily out at the brown river that purled around the town , and after one glance at her , he turned his back . John Bunyan caught Matthew 's action with one quick glance and tried to cover it by approaching her quickly , saying , " Well , well , what have we here ? Do I smell beef soup ? " He began busily helping her set the small table , keeping up a steady line of small talk . " Elizabeth did n't come ? Oh , well , tomorrow , then  --  my , look at this fresh bread , Matthew ! " He broke the loaf open and smelled it eagerly . " Ah ! Now that 's the way bread should be baked , I tell you ! And look at this cheese ? Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lydia let him busy himself with the food , and she stepped over to where Matthew was staring stolidly out the window . She took his arm and stood there , saying nothing until he finally turned and said , " Bloody cold today ! " " Yes . I 'll bring another blanket tomorrow  --  or maybe I can bring it later today . " " No matter , " he shrugged . " We 'll be out of this hole the day after the trial . " Bunyan looked up sharply at that , then shrugged and went back to slicing the bread and cheese . " Come and have a bite of this , Matthew , " he said cheerily . " I 'm not hungry . " " Oh , you have to eat ! " Lydia urged , and she pulled at hisp73arm , forcing him to approach the table . " I put some thyme in this broth  --  just the way you like it . " She ladeled out some of the hot stew into his bowl and set it in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to eat indifferently . Bunyan ignored that , and bowed his head . " Thank you , gracious God , for this good food , in the name of our precious Savior . Amen . " Matthew had the grace to look embarrassed , then grinned and said , " I 'm losing all my manners in this place . Pardon me , John . " Bunyan smiled and gave him a clap on the shoulder . Then he looked across the room and said quietly , " Maybe you ought to ask Mr. Jamison to have a bit of this fine stew , eh , my boy ? " Matthew gave him a sharp look , anger suddenly scoring his face . " That old buzzard ? He 's lucky I did n't pound him into the floor last night ! " Bunyan rebuked him at once , saying , " Matthew , he 's old and alone in the world . You 're young and strong and you have friends . Ca n't you be a little charitable ? " Matthew bit his lip , then got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked over to where a very tall old man sat hunched up against the wall , his face buried in his arms . " Here , Jamison , " he said , " have a bit of this good stew . It 'll warm you up . " The old man looked up , and when he saw who it was , he spat on the floor and buried his face again . " Well , that 's what you get for being a Christian in this place ! " Matthew snapped as he came back and sat down . " Ca n't blame the old man much . I 'm about to go batty in this place ! Be glad when the trial is over and we can get out of here . When will the trial come , John ? " " No way of telling . I 'm hoping Justice Twisten will schedule it in a week or two , but he 's vindictive enough to stretch it out till the crack of doom . " He bit his lip and shook his head . " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first baby is always harder on the mother , I think . " He gave a shake of his heavy shoulders , rose and smiled . " I 'll let you two have a little privacy , such as there is . " " Have some of this cheese , Matthew , " Lydia urged as Bun/yan moved across the room to speak to Jamison . " You 're so thin ! " He took a piece of the cheese , bit into it and chewed slowly . " I ca n't stand this place much longer , Lydia . " He spoke quietly , but there was a thick despair in his tone and she was appalled at the hollow look in his face , the fear that leaped out of his eyes . " It 's a time of testing , " she whispered softly . Putting her arm around him , she moved as close to him as the narrow bench would permit . She yearned to draw his head to her breast and comfort him as she did the smallest Bunyan , child , but it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're going to get through this , you and I. Remember the scripture , ' Whom the Lord loveth , he chasteneth ' ? This will make our marriage stronger than ever ! " He stared at her as if she were speaking a language foreign to him ; then a shiver ran through his thin frame . " I could stand anything , Lydia , I think  --  except these walls . " He gave a look that was almost wild at the massive stones that hemmed them in , and again a violent tremor shook his shoulders and she tightenedher hold . " It 's not the cold or the stench of this place , though God knows it 's miserable enough ! It 's not even being cut off from you . Oh , God , I could be happy in poverty  --  even in sickness , I think  --  if only I did n't have to be caged up like a dog ! " His voice rose higher so that several of the prisoners looked their way , and Lydia gave him a sudden hard grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dearest ! But it 's only for a little while ! " She hesitated , then drew his head down so that her lips were close to his ear and whispered something so softly that he missed it . " What 's that ? I ca n't hear you . " She pulled his head yet closer , and her breath was warm and soft as she murmured with gladness in her voice , " You must be brave , Husband , because you 're going to have a family ! " He sat there stock-still , as though he had not heard her , then slowly he turned and looked down into her eyes , which were brimming with tears  --  tears of joy . " A  --  baby ? " " Yes ! " He moved his lips but no sound came ; only his eyes reflectedp75his deep shock . Finally he smiled wanly , put his arm around her and kissed her , ignoring the guffaws from several of the prisoners . " A son ! " he said , and there was more life in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a daughter . " " Of course  --  it could be a girl ! " He sat there , and despite the abysmal surroundings  --  the stench and the frigid blasts of air that cut to the bone , the stares of the ragged prisoners and the gray , blank walls  --  Lydia 's heart sang , for it was the time she 'd prayed for . Never during their short marriage had she felt in perfect harmony with Matthew  --  not until now . They had laughed much and their minds were equal , and no couple , she was sure , could have been more fulfilled by the vibrant love they had shared . But she had always known there was a part of him she had not been able to enter  --  just as there was a part of her she longed to have him know , but he could not find it . Deep down she was aware that it was their walk with God  --  that private place , like a deeply hidden grotto where the spirit leaves the noisy world and meets with the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to share with Matthew . And deep within there was the lurking fear that the two of them , for all their bonds of body and mind , were strangers . Matthew lacked something , and while she dreaded being judgmental , she sensed a shallowness in his walk with God that kept them apart . But this moment had been one of total intimacy of spirit , and her heart cried out for him as he sat there holding her . This is marriage , she thought happily . But then he suddenly gave a start , looked around the cell with wild eyes , and when he turned to face her , there was somethingdistraught in his eyes  --  a fear that was mastering the joy that had flashed out when he had heard of her condition . " I 've got to get out of here , Lydia ! " he gasped , and with a moan he put his head in his hands . " How can I live with you having a baby  --  while I 'm cooped up like a dog ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We are God 's children , dearest  --  He will never forsake us ! " But it was as if she had not spoken , for he sat there with his face buried in his arms , and nothing she could say would bring him out of it.  |p76Finally  she arose and said , " I must go to Elizabeth . She 's having a difficult time with this baby . " Matthew raised his head and looked at Bunyan . Suddenly he motioned for the preacher to come , and Bunyan rose and stepped to where they stood . " John , Lydia is going to have a child ! " Bunyan ' s broad face beamed and he said heartily , " Is she now ? Well , that 's fine  --  fine ! " " No  --  not with me in prison ! And Elizabeth  --  she 's having a hard time , Lydia says . John , we 've got to get out of this place ! " Bunyan asked quietly , " Elizabeth is worse ? " " She 's not well , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the gray light that filtered feebly through the high window . His form seemed to be made of the same material as the walls  --  enduring , tough , and impervious to time or hard wear . But his face was not so , for as the light caught it , though his eyes , hidden in the hollow sockets of his face , evidenced deep pain , his features held such an expression of pain and sorrow that Lydia wanted to weep . Matthew stood there waiting for his reply , but when it came , it was not what he expected . " We must be faithful to God , my boy . ' He that loveth husbandor wife more than me is not worthy to be my disciple . ' Those are hard words , but our Savior speaks . You and I can bear the suffering to our own bodies , and Satan knows this well enough ! He will not attack us there , but where we are weak . And that is  --  that is our wives and our little ones ! " Matthew stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not provide for his own is worse than a heathen , " he quoted . " Does God expect us to let our loved ones suffer , those whom we 've vowed to protect ? " " He is the Father of the fatherless , and we must be faithful to His word . He will care for Elizabeth and my little ones  --  and He will take care of your dear wife and the little one to come . " Matthew stared at him , then turned with a bitter light in his blue eyes . " God is unfair ! " he said through clenched teeth , then wheeled and stalked stiff-legged to the window he 'd occupied earlier , staring out at the gray river that rolled heavily by the prison.  | " He 'll be better , " Bunyan whispered to Lydia as she stood there with tears in her eyes . " He 's young in the faith , and I was no stronger at his age . Pray ! Pray for him ! " Lydia was so full of fear she could not answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll take care of Elizabeth  --  perhaps she 'll be strong enough to come tomorrow . " She went home , walking slowly with her head down , impervious to the icy bite of the wind . A deadly spirit of fear more potent than winter 's blast was sweeping through her heart , and the tears that she could not contain rolled down her pale cheeks . She tried to pray , but the words would not come . So she walked beside the cold river , the dead brown grasses of summer breaking beneath her feet , and her heart rose up to God . She did not know what it was that she brought to God , but as the urgent cries of her soul ascended , somehow the presence of God came down , and the fear that had pierced her fled and she knew a peace in her spirit such as she had never known ! For many days this was her strength . Day after day rolled by , turning into weeks , then months , and there was no trial . Everything in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse that Lydia moved into the Bunyan house and with Mary 's help did all the housework . She was a comfort to Elizabeth , spending hours reading the Word of God , and the children came to look on her as a second mother . She made the short journey to the jail daily , for the state did not furnish food for the prisoners . This made the chore even more demanding , for neither she nor John Bunyan could bear to see those prisoners who had no family nor friends starve ; therefore , she brought as much extra food as she could . Matthew 's condition worsened almost daily . He lost weight at such an alarming rate that she feared for his life . His lungs were affected by the biting cold , and he developed a cough that disturbed them all . But even worse was the awful depression that gripped him . He spoke little , and seemed not to hear what she said most of the time . Her walks along the river grew longer , and she prayed fervently ; prayer built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry the heavy burden . Snow came , and on the second day when the earth wasp78muffled with white , Lydia left the Bunyan cottage and started for the jail . The heavy pot of soup dragged at her arm , and walking was difficult in the six-inch blanket of snow that covered the earth . She had turned the corner onto the main road that led to the jail , and as she lifted her eyes , what she saw sent a shock running through her so violent that she almost dropped the heavy iron pot . " Matthew ! " she cried out , struggling to run toward him , crying out his name , filled with wonder that he was free . Finally she set the pot down and ran toward him , her eyes so blinded with tears that she could barely see the tall figure so familiar to her . She fell into his arms and he caught her with aI1 powerful grip . " Matthew ! Oh , my dear ! " she cried out , holding to him as if she would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but at the same time strangely different , " Well , daughter , I am here . . . ! " She looked up , drawing back at once from his embrace . She saw a wedge-shaped face with wide lips , cornflower blue eyes such as she loved in Matthew  --  but it was not her husband ! He said , " I 've just come from my son , Lydia . We have much to pray about , you and I. " Then he smiled , and she saw the same courage and strength in the father 's eyes that she had fallen in love with in Matthew . " But first , will you allow me to have a father 's embrace ? For you are my daughter now ! " She gave a cry and fell into Gilbert Winslow 's strong arms as a battered ship comes out of a wild tearing storm into the peace and safety of a calm harbor !  | " She slipped away with the tide , " Gilbert Winslow said slowly . " Just as she had lived trusting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He sat relaxed in front of the cheerful fire that threw leaping figures on the walls of the small cottage . There was a quietness and peace in his voice that took away the sting of the news that Matthew 's mother was dead . He leaned forward to pick up the heavy iron poker , and Lydia 's eyes stung as she recognized in her father-in-law the easy grace and strength that she loved in Matthew . " It must have been terribly hard on you , Mr. Winslow . " " Hard ? " He looked at her with a starboard twist of his head , just as she 'd seen in Matthew a thousand times , then smiled and shook his head . " No , child , not hard . What was hard was watching her in pain from day to day . That last night the pain left , and we both knew it was time . She 'd always loved to watch the tide go out , so I picked her up and carried her to a clearing on the hill  --  the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . It was dawn , and just as the morning light came to turn the sea red , and the tide began ebbing from the shore , she turned to me , put her arms around my neck , and whispered , ' You 've been a good husband to me on this earth , Gilbert  --  but I must go now to my heavenly Bridegroom ! ' And then she put her head on my shoulder  --  and she left to be with Him ! " Sitting with her feet tucked beneath her , Lydia could notp80keep her eyes off her father-in-law . He looks far more like Matthew 's older brother than his father ! she thought suddenly . As he went on speaking quietly , she drew the brightly colored quilt around her like a cocoon , her eyes never leaving his face . Matthew is so much like him  --  but there 's something different , she thought . It was not long until she discovered what that difference was . Gilbert 's face was Matthew 's , but it had been refined by hardship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly with the soft , handsome features of the son . " I  --  I 'm glad you 've come , Mr. Winslow , " she said when he paused . " Matthew has been a good husband , but he 's changed since he went to prison . " Gilbert smiled at the first confession , then shook his head at the second . " He 's been like a wild hawk all his life , Lydia . He 'll dare anything , but you ca n't cage a wild creature without killing his spirit , I think . " " It 's killing him , that prison . " She threw the quilt back , got up and bent to pick up the heavy kettle . As she poured a cup of steaming water for his tea , she said steadily , " What do you think will happen to him ? " " If he stays in prison ? " He took the tea , sipped it carefully , then looked at her over the lip of the heavy cup . " He may not survive it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's very ill , as you know . That cough is bad  --  down deep in his lungs , and prison fever is quick and deadly as a serpent ! " She stared at him , hesitated , then asked the question aloud that she 'd never dared to frame to anyone . " Do you think he should give in to the Crown ? You realize he and Brother Bunyan can leave anytime they agree to obey the new law ? " " I know . " Gilbert turned the cup in his hands , seeming to find something fascinating in the plain surface . He sat comfortably in the chair , a strong figure even in repose . She had heard both from Winslow 's son and his brother how he had the daring of a buccaneer in his youth ; how he had been forced to choose between a place of prominence as the husband of Cecily North , daughter of Lord North , the beautiful aristocrat who had followedhim across the Atlantic , and the simple Pilgrim maiden , Humility Cooper . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repute , and would have risen in the world  --  but threw it all away to embrace the hard life of a poor minister on the rocky shores of Plymouth. 9p81She saw that strength in his hands , in his face , and in every line of his tall figure , and suddenly she thought , This is what I want for a husband ! This is what I thought Matthew was like ! He looked at her sharply , and said in answer to her question , " If he gives in to the Crown , he 'll live  --  but what will he have left ? A man who lets a king  --  or anyone else !  --  direct his soul may be alive physically , but he 's dead to the best that 's in him ! " " I 'm afraid for him . I 'm afraid for myself , for Mr. Bunyan , and for his poor wife and children ! " He rose and came to stand by her . Taking her hands in his he looked down on her for a long moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears , Lydia . I would be afraid , too , for Matthew is the last of his family  --  the last of the House of Winslow . " She smiled tremulously and said shyly , but with a note of triumph in her voice , " No , this child will have the Winslow name . " " Ah ! " A tender smile crossed Gilbert 's broad lips , and he embraced her , and the tender kiss he placed on her forehead broke down all restraint . It was as if she had known him all her life , and she leaned against him , clinging to him in her need as she had clung to her own father years ago . " I 'm glad you 're here , " she said again . " It gives me faith , and I know you can help Matthew . " He shook his head , saying only , " I trust that is so  --  but in one sense and in some things , a man must make his own way . We will try and we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I know  --  but he has such faith in you  --  and so do I ! " She laughed awkwardly and added , " Here you are fresh off the ship , and I dump all my care onto you the first time we meet ! " He said at once , " You 're not a weak woman , Lydia . No , indeed ! You know that thought that came to me , not five minutes after we met ? Here is a woman as strong as my Humility ! I never thought to hear myself say it , " he smiled . She was embarrassed by the compliment , but warmed all the same by his approval . " I must go to Mrs. Bunyan 's . Would you go with me , to pray for her ? " " Of course ! " The two of them made their way through the falling snow , and Mr. Winslow became an instant success with the small Bunyans . He knew all sorts of games it seemed , and he thoughtp82nothing of roughing with the little ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fireplace , and she watched in amazement while the tall minister got down on his hands and knees with the children . " He 's an unusual man , is n't he ? He loves children , that 's plain , " she whispered to Lydia . When the children were in bed , he spent a long time reading the Bible to Lydia and Elizabeth ; the Book of Hebrews , the eleventhchapter , and the ancient promises seemed to fill the small room with warmth . Finally he closed the book and prayed for Elizabeth and for her husband warmly and fervently . After he had left , the strength of his presence lingered somehow , and Elizabeth smiled at Lydia , saying , " He 's got a strength in him , that man has ! John will love him ! " " Who would n't ? " Lydia responded softly . " He 's the kind of man  --  " She broke off and Elizabeth finished , " The kind of man you saw in Matthew ? Yes , and it 's there , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his father 's blood in Matthew Winslow to win his battle ! " During the weeks that followed , Lydia thought often of Elizabeth'swords . But there seemed to be little to merit hope that Matthew would justify the thought . She saw no improvement in him ; indeed , the news of his mother 's death came as such a blow to him that even the strong encouragement Gilbert offered was offset . Gilbert 's presence was more of a blessing to John Bunyan , it seemed , than to his own son . The two men became fast friends at once , and Winslow spent most of his time at the prison studyingthe Scripture with Bunyan . Gilbert was captivated by the man 's vivid imagination , and often when Mary came to visit , he sat there listening to Bunyan 's stories as intently as she . " You ought to write a book , John ! " he often said . " I 'm no book writer ! " " You 're the best teller of tales I 've ever heard , " Winslow insisted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's almost like reading the Bible , in a way ! Think what it would mean if Christian parents had a story about a man who leaves his home and fights his way through difficulties to get to heaven ! " " They have the Bible , " Bunyan shrugged.  | " But , Father , your stories make the Bible easier to understand , " Mary protested . " There you have it , John , " Winslow laughed . " Wisdom from the lips of babes , eh , Matthew ? " " Yes , I suppose so . " Matthew sat on a pile of straw , picking at it listlessly . There was no life in his voice . Bunyan and Winslow exchanged glances , but said nothing . They had spoken quietly about the young man when Matthew was out of hearing , and agreed that if he gave in to the Crown 's new law , he would live , but would be forever scarred in his spirit . Bunyan picked up the story of Pilgrim and had gotten the hero into a terrible predicament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pastor Gifford rushed in , his eyes filled with excitement . " Twisten  --  he 's set a date for the trial ! " " When ? " Matthew wheeled from where he stood and leaped to the pastor 's side , showing more animation than they had seen in weeks . " A month from now , less a day ! " " Thank God ! " Matthew cried out , tears gathering in his eyes . " Yes , thank God , " Bunyan said ; then he added carefully , " Now we must pray for a verdict in our favor . " Matthew stared at him , then declared defiantly , " God will not leave us here to rot ! " He shook his head and laughed for the first time since Gilbert had come to Bedford . " It 's going to be all right ! You 'll see ! " When Lydia came later that day , she was taken off guard by the difference in Matthew . He embraced her , swinging her around in a circle in the old way , crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over ! " " Matthew , be careful , " she cried out breathlessly . " You 'll get your cough started again ! " " Devil take the cough ! " he grinned . " Let me get a breath of free air and that cough will leave one way or another ! " He carried on wildly all the time she was there . The activity did start his cough again , and she had to force him to lie down before he strangled . The two red spots which had shown in his cheeks a week earlier reappeared , and she knew his fever was up . That night when Gilbert came by to pray for Elizabeth , she said , " He 's better , is n't he ? "  | " Yes , I suppose . " There was a caution in Gilbert 's voice , and he added soberly , " But it will go hard with him if the verdict is n't favorable . " " Do  --  do you think that it will be bad  --  the verdict ? " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . I have to go to London to see my brother in two days . I 'll find out something from him . He 's in prison , but he still has powerful friends , and some of them may help . " After Gilbert left , Lydia made the mistake of mentioning his words to Matthew , and he grabbed at the chance eagerly . " Why , of course ! Uncle Edward will help us ! " " He 's unable to help himself , lad , " Bunyan said quickly . " You never have a cheerful word , do you John ? " Bunyan ' s efforts to prepare the young man for the possibility of bad news from the trial had not worked ; on the contrary , they had driven a wedge between the two that had given grief to the Bunyans as well as to Lydia . " John is just  --  " " I know what John is doing ! " Matthew snapped at her . " You 're a fine help , all of you ! Where 's your faith ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , that 's what I 'm doing  --  and the rest of you are digging my grave with your unbelief  --  ! " He broke off into a paroxysm of coughing and fought Lydia as she attempted to help him . " Leave me alone , you doubters ! " he gasped and withdrew into the farthest corner of the cell . He apologized the following day , but there was a constraint in him , and he had little to say to either of them . The only subject that he cared about was the trial  --  that and the return of Gilbert with good news . Lydia was at the jail the afternoon Gilbert came back . Bunyanwas standing on a bench , speaking out the window to a small group who had formed the habit of coming from time to time to hear him preach . Gilbert saw them as he approached , and he paused to listen as the strong voice of Bunyan carried easily on the cold air . The shivering listeners stood there , shifting from one frozen foot to another , beating their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none left until he prayed a final prayer and called out a cheery " God bless you ! " Cobb said as he entered , " Well , sir , here you are , ai n't youp85now ? I hopes it 's good news you be bringin ' to the lad . He 's lived for little else ! " Matthew saw his father enter and came to him at once . " Father , what did Uncle Edward say ? Will he help us ? " Gilbert pulled off his cloak slowly , not taking his eyes from Matthew 's face . There was something in his eyes that held the young man speechless . Finally he said , " Your uncle is dead , my boy . Gone to be with his Lord . " Matthew jerked as though he had been struck ; his face twisted and he dropped his head , turning blindly toward the wall . Lydia ran to him , and Bunyan said quietly , " I 'm sorry to hear it , Gilbert . He was a godly man . " " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's better off , John . He was very ill , and there was little hope of any sort of life for him . I think they would have executed him if he had lived until the next sitting of the court . " " No , surely not ! " Bunyan said , shocked at the thought . Gilbert leaned back against the wall , saying in a tired voice . " They executed Major-General Harrison last Friday . I was there . " " I ca n't believe it , " Bunyan said . " He was such a good man . " " But close to Cromwell  --  as was Edward . It was Edward who asked me to go . I 'll never forget it . He came to his death as cheerful as any man could do in that condition . He made a brief speech giving glory to God , making no reference to the shameful manner in which he was being treated by his enemies . After he was taken down , his head and his heart were removed and shown to the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beastly these people can be ! That 's why I can not grieve over Edward . He was spared that . I was with him when he died . He was anxious to go . " The shock of his uncle 's death hit hard at Matthew , causing him to speak only of the trial . Two days before the date which Justice Twisten had set , Lydia sat beside her husband , listening as he spoke eagerly of the day he would be set free . Finally he stooped , and she said , " I found something you might like , Matthew . " " What is it ? " " Oh , it 's just a poem . Your father showed it to me last night . A man he knew as a boy wrote it , and it 's become famous . "  | " A poem ? What does it say ? " Matthew asked listlessly . " It was written to a young woman by a man named Lovelace . It 's just the last verse that I thought you might like . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Stone walls do not a prison make , Nor iron bars a cage . Minds innocent and quiet takeThat for a hermitage . If I have freedom in my loveAnd in my soul am free , Angels alone that soar aboveEnjoy such liberty ! " She smiled up at him , saying with a smile , " Stone walls do not a prison make , nor iron bars a cage . " He stared at her soberly , then shook his head . " That 's pretty poetry , but it 's not life . " She sat there and for the first time she asked what had been in her heart for weeks , " Matthew , what if  --  what if things do n't go well ? " " What ? " he asked angrily . " What are you talking about ? " " I 've prayed so hard , " she said , taking his arm . " But even if you and John did have to stay here for a little while longer , it 'll be  --  " " It 's not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild look around at the walls . " Lydia , I 'll die in this place ! God wo n't let it happen ! " She changed the subject quickly , but her heart was filled with foreboding as she went home , and she knew that Gilbert felt the same . The hours crawled slowly by , but at last the day came for the trial . Every square inch of space was filled in the large hall used for trials , and in spite of the freezing cold , those who could not get inside thronged the outside . Justice Twisten sat on a raised platform , his beefy face stony as the case proceeded . " What is the charge against these men ? " A reedy-voiced clerk named Jacob Tillage read from a large sheet : " John Bunyan and Matthew Winslow , both of Bedford , are charged with a violation of the King 's law , being upholders and maintainers of unlawful assemblies and Conventicles , and for not conforming to the National Worship of the Church of England . "  |p87A  great hulking fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he gave a long , rambling testimony as to how he had followed the two and found them addressing a group of people . " Were they armed , any of them ? " Justice Twisten demanded . " Sir ? " " Were they armed , I say ! " " No , sir , they did n't have naught but Bibles ! " " Very well . " The testimony droned on and finally the justice said , " John Bunyan , you may rise and give your defense . " Bunyan was pale from his stay inside , but he spoke firmly and eloquently . A duel soon developed between him and the justice , and it terminated in Twisten shouting , " You will heed the laws of England or I will either see you hanged or you will be harried out of this land ! " " I will in all civil laws be obedient to my king  --  whom God knows I respect and pray for  --  but I will obey the voice of that King who is immortal when there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by your own mouth ! " Twisten cried out , getting to his feet in his anger . " You have not denied that you and Winslow were engaged in breaking the King 's law . On the basis of your own testimony and on the evidence presented to this court , I sentence you to perpetual imprisonment ! " A hum went over the court and he looked around the crowded room , adding , " Do not waste your pity on these men . They may leave prison at any moment  --  at any moment , that is , when they agree to obey the law . " Bunyan suddenly raised his voice and cried out loudly , " I will preach the gospel until the moss grows up to my eyes ! " " Be it on your head then , " Twisten said , staring at the two men . " You will stay in Bedford Jail until you promise to do your preaching within the limits set by the King ! Bailiff , take these two men back to their cells ! This court is dismissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilbert ? " Lydia asked wearily . She leaned her arm against the wall , placed her forehead on it , and bit her lip to keep back the tears . " It 's going to kill him , you know  --  he 's lived for this new baby . " " Too bad ! Too bad ! " Gilbert shook his head . He picked up his heavy coat and said as he pulled it on , " Yes , I 'll go . You 'll stay with Elizabeth ? " " Yes . " She straightened up and tried to put a little cheer into her voice . " At least Elizabeth is all right . She can have other children , the doctor said . Tell John that . " " All right . " " And tell Matthew  --  " She broke off suddenly and stared at the tall man so much like her husband . A question leaped to her lips , and she suppressed it , then seemed to be in fear of something . Finally she asked , " I do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  about the way he is ? " Winslow nodded slowly . " His mind is troubled . I worry about that more than his health . " " Yesterday he talked so wildly I could n't make sense of it . He talked about dying . I think he 's given up hope . " Gilbert nodded slowly . " He 's sick in body , but we must pray even more for his spirit , Lydia . " Winslow left the cottage and made his way along the muddyp89road , dodging puddles as he went . The first breath of spring had come , melting the snow and stirring the life that lay buried in the frozen ground . He looked at a tiny crocus shouldering a chip inside , vibrant with color against the dull winter earth , and thought of the dead child that all of them mourned . " Too bad ! " he murmured again . Cobb admitted him into the cell , and he went at once to where Bunyan and Matthew sat together on a bench . Bunyan rose at once , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He waited until Gilbert drew near , then he searched his face , and said quietly , " Elizabeth 's lost the baby . " Gilbert nodded . " Yes . I 'm sorry , John . " " Is she all right ? " " The doctor says she 's fine . She can have other children . " " Praise God ! " Bunyan breathed heavily , then went over to stare out of the window , alone in his grief . Gilbert sat down by Matthew , noting that he looked more worn and haggard than ever . The cough had gotten worse , too , but the mental state troubled Gilbert more . " It 's getting warmer , son . Spring is on the way . " Matthew shrugged , saying only , " I suppose I should have known it would happen . " Gilbert did not understand him . " What 's that , son ? " " I knew the baby would die . " " It 's a shame  --  but you must n't worry about Lydia . She 's very healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , sunk deep in his skull . He bore little resemblance to the vigorous young man he had been before his imprisonment . When he spoke , his voice was dead and lifeless as his eyes . " I ca n't believe anything anymore . " " You do n't mean that , son , " Gilbert said quietly . He put his hand on the young man 's shoulder and there was an urgency in his eyes and in his voice as he spoke . " You 've had a bad knock , but these things will pass ... " Matthew listened as his father spoke , but there was a sullen set to his shoulders , and finally he said , " Did n't you hear Justice Twisten ? ' Perpetual imprisonment ' was the term . You know as well as I that there 's no way out of this hole , unless  --  "  | " Do n't even think that way ! " Gilbert said quickly . " I know you 're sick and despondent and there 's the baby on the way . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man again . " " And if I do n't get out of here , I 'll be dead ! " Matthew snapped , a madness glowing in his eyes . Then he took a deep breath and said , " I 've decided what I 'm going to do , Father  --  and I know you and John will disapprove . You think it 's terrible for a man to give in , but it 's different with me . " " How is it different ? " " Why , you must see that John is a preacher  --  that 's what he 's going to do . But I 'm not . " " You were preaching the gospel , Bunyan tells me  --  and you told me yourself that you felt God 's hand on your life . " " Well , I did say that , but many young fellows take a try at preaching and find out it 's just a notion . " " Matthew , do n't  --  " " Do n't tell me what to do ! " Matthew cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched carefully , then came over to stand beside them . " I could n't help overhearing . " His fine eyes were filled with compassion and he said , " Do n't make a decision now . Wait until you 've had time to pray about it . " Matthew stared at them and a wild look came into his eyes , a look of madness , and Gilbert saw how close his son was to losing his mind . He said at once , " I 'll leave now , son . You try to calm yourself and I 'll come back tomorrow . We 'll think of some-thing . " He bade goodbye to Bunyan , begging him with his eyes to look after Matthew . He did not go to the cottage but walked along a little-traveled road , seeking God with desperation . Bunyanhad spoken to him of his son 's preoccupation with death , and it frightened him more than anything that had ever come to him . He prayed until finally he looked up and saw that the sun was setting , then turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the children , and he took over some of the chores so she could be with Elizabeth . It was late by the time the children were in bed and Elizabeth was asleep , but he sat beside her , telling her about his visit with Matthew . She sat there staring at the glowing coals in the fireplace ,  |p91then  said , " I 'm so tired of it all , I ca n't even think . " " I know . I  --  I 'm not sure it 's right , Lydia . " The strain had etched new lines on Gilbert 's face , and he shook his head in despair . " If it were my life , I 'd know what to do  --  but who can decide a thing like this for another ? " That was as far as they got , and he trudged on home wearily . He did not expect to sleep , but he did by some miracle . He had missed much sleep , and slept far past his usual early time for arising . A loud knocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one startled glance that the sun was high in the sky . " Gilbert ! Wake up ! " He staggered to the door groggy with sleep , threw the door open to find Lydia there with fear in her eyes . " He 's gone ! " was all she could say . Then sobs rose to her throat and she fell against him , weeping with abandon . " Matthew ? " he demanded . He had to wait until she could collect herself . Finally she drew back and wiped her eyes . " Yes ! He sent for Justice Twisten yesterday and agreed to obey the new law  --  so the justice releasedhim . " " Did he tell you this  --  Matthew , I mean ? " " No ! I have n't seen him  --  but when I got home from the Bunyan 's yesterday , his clothes were all gone , and I found this note . " Gilbert took the scrap of paper she thrust at him and read it quickly : " Lydia , I 'm going away . Please try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was written in a wavering hand and was not even signed . " He was almost mad yesterday , " Gilbert said , biting his lip , trying to think what to do . " And I think he was delirious with fever . " " Where could he have gone ? " Lydia moaned . " Well , he ca n't have gone far , " Gilbert said quickly . " Do n't worry , we 'll find him , Lydia . " But that was not the case , for after getting the word out to all the village , the best they could discover was that he was not in Bedford . Everyone knew him well from his connection with Bunyan , and it was not until the following day , after a sleepless night , that Gilbert came to the Bunyan cottage to meet Lydia.  | " You 've found him ? " Lydia cried , seeing no gloom on Gilbert'sface as he had worn since the previous day . " No  --  but the coach driver came back through  --  the one that drives the London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way through this time , but he has said that a man of Matthew 's descriptiongot on here in Bedford and was still on the coach headed for London yesterday . " " London ! Why would he go there ? " " I fear he 's making for the coast to get a ship out of the country . " Gilbert took her arm and squeezed it tightly . " I 'll go at once . Surely I 'll be able to find him ! All I have to do is check the ships about to depart . " " You must find him , Gilbert ! He 's out of his mind  --  I 'll go with you ... " " No , you stay here in case we 're wrong and he comes back , " Gilbert said . " I 'll not go on a coach ; that 'd be too slow . I 've alreadybought a fast horse , and I 'll be in London almost by the time the coach gets there . God willing , I may even overtake it ! " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . She touched her body unconsciously , and he knew she was thinking of the child that was to come . " God is still in control ! " " Amen ! " he said ; he embraced her , then hurried away , his mind whirling with plans . The hours crawled by for the next week , and although Lydia knew with her mind that the distance was too great for Gilbert to go and return in such a short time , she spent hours looking south down the Great Road . She ate nothing , but fasted and prayed until her face grew pale with strain . Bunyan urged her to eat : " God knows the intent of your heart , " he said gently . " You must think of the child . " On the sixth day , Pastor Gifford brought a note direct from the coach . It was from Gilbert : " I have looked day and night with no success . But do not despair . It may be that he left the coach and went on to a coastal town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely place for a man to take a ship for other lands . " He urged Lydia to keep her trust in God , and promised to write as soon as he found any trace of Matthew . Three weeks later Lydia looked up the lane and saw Gilbert walking slowly toward her cottage . There was something in hisp93air that brought a great fear into her heart , and she rose to her feet slowly . His face was very thin , and it bore the unmistakable marks of grief as he walked up to her side and said at once , " Lydia , my dear ... " She saw that he could not finish , and she said dully , " He 's dead , is n't he ? " " Yes . " Gilbert 's lips tightened , and he took her in his arms . " You must be mother and father now to the little one . " He drew hack and there was a fierce intensity scored across his strong features . " What happened , Gilbert ? " she asked quietly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's little to tell , child , " he said wearily . " I found no trace of him until a week ago . I had gone to Southampton first and found nothing . One of the men I met there was a ship 's carpenter named Lyle . He was waiting for his ship to be refitted . It took longer than he thought , and he came to Portsmouth where his family lives . I ran into him by accident , and he rememberedme at once . " " Had he seen Matthew ? " Lydia asked eagerly . Gilbert nodded slowly . " Yes . Lyle knew him from my description , and he told Matthew about my inquiry . " " What ? " Gilbert shook his head , his eyes cloudy with grief . " Lyle reported that Matthew said , ' There 's no one in this world who 'd want to find me now ! ' " " But what happened ? " " Lyle told me he took passage on a trading schooner Intrepid , Captain George Milton 's ship . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My dear , the Intrepid went down with all hands in a hurricane two weeks ago . " " Could  --  could there be a mistake ? " Lydia 's eyes pleaded with him , but Gilbert shook his head firmly . " I went to Southampton and talked to the owners . Another ship , West Wind , was in the same storm . She saw the Intrepid go down , but there was no way they could help . He 's gone , my dear ! " She looked up at him with horror and pain in her dark eyes . " Are you certain ? "  | " It would be torment to live on false hope , Lydia , much as I would like to offer some hope . I questioned the quartermaster who fitted out the ship , and he remembered Matthew well . He signed on and left with the ship . " Lydia shut her eyes and suddenly began to sway . Gilbert helped her to a bench in front of the cottage and sat down beside her , waiting until she had wept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to tell you what I think God has said , Lydia , concerning you and the child ... " The salt spray bit Lydia 's lips as she stood on the deck of the New Hope , a two-masted schooner , watching England fade as the ship plowed into the green-gray seas . " I know , child , " Gilbert said quickly . " It 's hard on the heart , leaving your home  --  but the New World will be a better place for you  --  and for my grandson . " That had been his plan , and Lydia was anxious to go  --  to find a new life for herself and her baby . The only relative she had in England was her aunt , and she had grown to love Gilbert Winslow as a father . He had no blood kin of his own , and this loss drew them together more than anything else . Now she expressed one flickering moment of doubt . " Gilbert , is it right  --  my going to Plymouth ? " He looked down at her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll never forget Matthew  --  not as long as his father is alive ! He put his strong arm around her and smiled . " It 's only a little while before we really go home , Lydia . But until that day comes , you and my grandchild need a place and a people . " He paused and looked westward , almost as if he could see Plymouth with his keen blue eyes . Then he looked down at her and said quietly , " The last of the House of Winslow , Lydia  --  that 's the precious burden you 're carrying ! " And then he led her to the jutting prow of the New Hope , where they looked out to the open seas to the future together.  |p97The  wedding day was clear and bright on the morning of April 2 , 1675 . Rachel Winslow smiled to herself as she peered into the polished mirror , murmuring , " Fourteen years old this day  --  an old woman you 're getting to be ! " She tossed the mirror on the bed with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a rush . Her mother looked up from the table where she was kneading dough , saying , " One would think you were the bride , the trouble you take prettying yourself up ! " The words sounded harsh , but there was little of that quality in Lydia Winslow . Plymouth folks had come to take almost for granted her numerous charities , and the daughter who came over to smile at her did not seem in the least alarmed . She reached out and tucked a raven black tress of her mother 's hair under the kerchief she wore and said carelessly , " I want to look nice for Joshua , Mother . He 's probably going to come by and ask me to marry him again . " Lydia did not miss the saucy look in Rachel 's hazel eyes , and she shook her head . " And you 'll turn him away as usual . You may be sorry for that one day , Rachel . He 'd be a good husband . " " Country 's full of good husband material , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of otherp98pesky varmints , too , but I do n't have to take up with any of them . " Lydia stared at her , knowing she ought to be outraged and shocked , but as usual she threw up her hands and laughed . " You are a silly girl ! " she said with affection . " Grandfather says I 've got more brains than the whole New England Confederation , " Rachel stated with a demure look . " Your grandfather is a wise man  --  except where you 're concerned , and in that area he has n't a grain of sense ! " " He says you 're the most beautiful woman in the Colonies . I guess he 's just prejudiced about you , too , Mother . " " Indeed he is . Now , get out of here , you goose ! Go help that poor girl who 's going to look as plain as an old shoe when she stands up next to you ! " Then she flung one last comment at Rachel as the girl was leaving : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's more than I can say for you ! " Rachel laughed and ran lightly down the road that sloped past Governor Bradford 's house toward the harbor , and took a right . She found Mercy Doolittle , the bride , inside the bungalow where she lived with her parents and five other children . " Oh , it 's you , Rachel ! " Mercy 's mother exclaimed . She handed the comb to Rachel , saying , " See if you can do anything with Mercy 's hair  --  I 'll go help with the cooking ! " " Well , the big day is here , girl , " she said , pulling the comb through Mercy 's hair with such force that the poor girl cried out . " Be still , now ! This is your last day of freedom , and that husband of yours will give you worse if you do n't mind him . " " Oh , Praise God and me , we 'll do fine . " Rachel smiled at the name of the bridegroom  --  Praise God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a fight with him , wo n't it , Mercy ? I mean , how can you scream with anger and yell ' Praise God ! ' at the same time ? " Mercy was a tall , homely girl , rawboned and awkward , but her good humor and kindness redeemed her for everyone  --  especiallyPraise God , who could not be convinced that she was not as lovely as a rose . The stocky , muscular man of twenty-two was a blacksmith and a tinker , had been known to drink a little too much on occasion , and his reputation as somewhat of a ladies ' man persisted in spite of his denials . In any case , the twop99were satisfied with one another and as Mercy put it , " So long as we suit each other , why , let others keep their noses out ! " Her one beauty was her hair , and as Lydia combed it into a shining fall of reddish gold , she asked curiously , " Mercy , are you afraid ? " " Afraid ? Of what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wo n't it be hard to do everything Praise God tells you ? " Mercy pulled away , turned and stared at her friend , and a smile touched her lips . " Why , it would be for you , I 'm thinking , you bein ' so smart and all . But most women do n't have a very strong mind . " This was commonly believed among most of the colonists , and Mercy elaborated on the doctrine . " Why , I heard tell of a lass once , and her father taught her all sorts of readin ' and writin ' . Well , one day she goes mad and strangles her daughter , she did ! Them at court said ' t was the learnin ' of readin ' and writin ' as done it , destroyed the brain , it not bein ' so strong as a man 's brain . " " I see , " Rachel smiled wryly . Mercy reached out and touched the cheek of the dark-haired girl , saying with a smile , " You 'll not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Rachel Winslow . Lord help the poor fellow who tries to get that job done ! " " No hurry about me , " Rachel said ; then she laughed and urged , " You 'd better get your finery on , Mercy , or Praise God will have to wait for his bride  --  and he 's not a man to wait for a woman long , is he now ? " She had just finished helping Mercy put on her wedding dress , a bodice dyed blue for constancy and an orange skirt . Some who came from England had the idea that the Separatists at Plymouth wore only black or gray , but that was only for meetingson Sabbath ; most of them loved bright colors and decked themselves out with finery on every other occasion . They heard the sound of singing and Rachel cried , " There they come ! " Soon the air was filled with the sound of song , and they went outside to be greeted by the marriage party . There were at least forty of them , every young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a church matter to the Separatists , just as Christmas was not recognized as a religious holiday.  |p100They  proceeded to the large open space in front of the CommonHouse , where the civil wedding was performed by Judge Haskell . A long prayer by Gilbert Winslow completed the ceremony . " Now , for the cake ! " Judge Haskell cried out , and he took up a large plain cake in his hands , and parted it by breaking it gently over Mercy 's head . He tossed it out to the crowd in fragments , and there was a wild scramble , for it was considered a fine thing to gather up a piece of bridecake and put it under your pillow and dream of whom you were to wed . As Rachel picked up a small piece , she heard a voice in her ear say , " Why settle for a dream , Rachel , when you can have the real man ? " She turned with a smile to face a tall fair-faced man with dark blue eyes in his large round face . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed at her and there was admiration in his face , but caution , too . " Well , you 've got enough poor devils wandering around moonstruck without adding me to the bedlamites . " " I thought you 'd back out , David Morris ! You 're no man ! " He stood there laughing at her , drinking in her fresh beauty and her wit , but like others , he wondered if it was quite right for a woman to be so witty . Well enough for a man to have sharp wit , but would it be wearing to have a wife who was so sharp ? He admired her , but she saw the same reservation she 'd seen in other men , and since she had no idea of marrying David Morris , it gave her pleasure to keep him off balance . Noticing her grandfather standing close , listening to their conversation , she left young Morris to take his arm . She pulled him away , saying , " Let 's go eat while the food 's hot . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said with a smile . " You 've spoiled me , Grandfather , " she laughed up at him . " When I find a man as handsome and as witty as you , I 'll submit at once ! " She looked at him with a smile , half-serious , for he was still a fine-looking man at the age of 75 . The auburn hair had some silver in it , but was still thick and smooth over his neck , and the lines in his angular face only made it look stronger than ever . His wide-set bright blue eyes , undimmed by age , gleamedp101from under bushy brows . He moved easily , his tall frame still strong enough to walk most young men into the ground . " You 'll have to settle for what you can get , girl , " he jibed with a sudden smile that made him look much younger . " You 're pretty enough , but you 've scared most of the suitors off with your pert tongue . " " If they 're afraid of a woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she retorted . He could never argue with her for long , this beautiful granddaughter of his . He had been the first to hold her after she was born , the only grandchild he 'd have on this earth , and although he 'd hoped for a grandson to carry on the family name , he had lost his heart to the red , squalling bit of humanity  --  part French , part English , and for fourteen years he had made her his chief interest in life , taking second place only to his loyalty to God . They came to the great table laden with roast venison , roast turkey , fricasse of chicken , beef hash , boiled fish , stuffed cod , pigeons , boiled eels , Indian pudding , succotash , roast goose stuffed with chestnuts , pumpkin pies , apple tarts and to wash it all down , beer , cider , claret , flip , brandy , and sack posset . As they ate Gilbert said , " I 'm going to the Indian camp to-morrow . " " Oh , take me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who wants to make a hard journey to a dirty old Indian camp filled with fleas ? " He laughed at the color which had risen to her cheeks . " You could n't intend to stop by and see Jude Alden , I do n't suppose ? " " Why , I suppose , since it 's on the way . . . " He smiled at her , knowing her as well in some ways as he knew himself . " You little minx ! Think I do n't read that devious little head of yours ? " " Can I go , Grandfather ? " " I suppose . Someday you 're going to ask me for something I wo n't give you ! " She smiled up at him , and he said impulsively , " You 're very much like your father  --  when you smile , I see him in my mind 's eye as clearly as I see you . " Her eyes opened wide , and she stared at the old man , forp102he almost never mentioned her father . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not so much as you look like your mother  --  which is God 's blessing ! " he added , and as always Rachel marveled that the only bitterness she had ever seen in Gilbert Winslow found its object in his son , Matthew . She had heard the whole story of his short marriage to her mother and his death . When her mother had first told her of her father 's sad end , she had cried for days , then ended up hating him . She never reasoned it out that she despised him for being a coward , or for depriving her of a normal family . Inside she kept her feelings buried , but it always shocked her to see her grandfather subject to any fault , and now she stood there marveling at this one flaw in his otherwise perfect character . He said hastily , " Be ready early , child , it 's a long trip . " He left , and all afternoon during the dances and festivities , Rachel could not help thinking of her father  --  even as Praise God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . As the custom was , the rosy-faced couple sat in bed dressed in their shifts , and the young people took turns standing at the foot of the bed throwing socks over their shoulders . The belief was that if a sock thrown by a girl hit the bride , or one thrown by a boy hit the groom , it was a sign of a speedy marriage . When Rachel threw a sock that hit Mercy square in the face , a scream went up , and she ran from the room with her hands over her ears to shut out the rather crude jokes that always accompaniedsuch a feat . She made her escape from the crowd and walked along the rocky beach . Soon she passed beyond the large rock where it was said the first of the Pilgrims set foot when alighting from the Mayflower . Weary of the wild singing and loud merry-making , she let the quiet of the isolated beach flow over her . The crashing of the surf punctuated the silence and the cry of the gulls melded with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time she made her way aimlessly , picking up a shell to examine its intricatewhorls , then tossing it back to the sandy beach . You 're very like your father sometimes . The words of her grandfathercame back to her , and she tried again to imagine what hep103had been like . There was no portrait at all , of course . Few people had such things , for they were expensive . The one portrait her grandfather had was a beautiful oil painting of his brother Edward , the older brother he 'd been so close to . Rachel 's mother had told her once that her father had looked very much like Gilbert and his brother . " All Winslow men look alike , they say . But you take after me . " She thought then of her mother , who spoke of her father in a general way , but Rachel could never get beneath the impenetrablesurface of Lydia Winslow 's manner  --  in this one matter . Once Rachel remembered saying in exasperation , " Mother , you never tell me anything important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of that conversation as she climbed the hill that led to the house she shared with her mother and grandfather , and her powerful gift of imagination brought it back to her as clearly as if it were painted on a canvas before her . She saw her mother 's smooth face suddenly break in some minute way , and her eyes dropped . Finally she said with just a suggestion of a tremor in her voice , " We had so little time , Rachel ! Just a few months , and then he was  --  gone . " " Did he love you ? " Rachel heard her young voice piping back to the present . Her mother looked up , her eyes moist as she whispered , " Oh , yes , child , yes ! He loved me at first  --  but later . . . " She had suddenly straightened up and said in a tone almost harsh , " He 's gone Rachel , and it grieves me to speak of it . " Rachel reached the house , a new " salt box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiny house he had built in 1622 , when he and Humility had first been married . She passed through the front door into a short entrance hall ; to the left was a combined kitchen and dining room , but she turned right into the common room where she found her mother entertainingMr . Oliver Bradford , the grandson of the famous governor , John Bradford . " Well , did you get the young folks married , Rachel ? " he asked , getting up as she entered . He was a robust man of 46 , slightly less than medium height , with brown hair cut short and warm brown eyes . He had always been partial to Rachel , andp104since the death of his wife , her willingness to spend time with his young children had made him value her even more . " Oh , they 're tied together forever , Mr. Bradford , " she smiled . " Happy as larks and poor as church mice ! " " Ah , but Praise God is so much in love , he 'd never notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in black , as she always was , but the sober garb only seemed to set off her beauty . Her cheeks were as rosy as a girl 's , as were her full lips . Many young women were put to despair when they took in her slender , rounded figure , for at the age of 32 , time seemed not to have touched her . Her grandfather had said once , " Rachel , if I did n't know better , I 'd think your mother was a witch ! It 's unearthly how she simply refuses to get old  --  why , she looks exactly the same as she did before you were born ! " Indeed , the dark beauty of Lydia Winslow had drawn men to her for years , but she had never shown the slightest interest in marriage . When Deacon Charles Milton had courted her in vain , Gilbert had said , " Well , Charles has looks , money , charm , and is a godly man , Lydia . If he wo n't do , who will ? " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry food to a hungry family . The church had become her life , and though many had said that an unmarried man like Gilbert Winslow would have trouble with her , she had spiked those guns by being a handmaiden of the Lord in a way that nobody could fault . " Did you manage to give the bride a touch with the sock ? " Bradford asked with a smile . " Yes , but I 'm waiting for a man like you or my grandfather to come along , " Rachel shot back . Glancing slyly at her mother , she asked innocently , " Did you two settle anything ? " Oliver Bradford had been slow in making his decision . It had been over a year since his wife died , but his sudden frequent calls on Lydia Winslow had been a little too obvious . Everyone in the settlement knew he had made up his mind to marry Lydia Winslow . His sharp-featured face flushed , and he answered , " We  --  have talked somewhat , but your mother is reluctant . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lydia followed him to the door , and they said a few words that Rachel could not catch.  |p105When  Lydia returned , she said , " You should n't tease people , Rachel . " " Why do n't you marry him , Mother ? " Rachel asked suddenly . She came to look closely into Lydia 's face , and then , seeing a trace of confusion , she added a question she had wonderedabout for years . " I 've wondered why you never married  --  but then , everybody has . Is it because you 're still in love with my father ? " " No ! " Lydia answered brusquely . " No , that would be foolish , Rachel . I shall never marry because I believe that God has called me to live a single life . " " Do n't you need a man , Mother ? " she asked , then flushed suddenly and stammered , " I  --  I mean ... " Lydia threw back her head and laughed , and it made a merry sound in the room . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you blush , Rachel ! " She put her arm around the young woman , a younger edition of herself , and laughing , added , " I thought you were much too grown up and ' advanced ' to be embarrassed by a reference to what the deacons call ' the intimaciesof the connubial bed ' ! " Then she saw that the girl was really stricken , and she stopped laughing , saying softly , " Most women do need a man , just as a man needs a woman , Rachel . But Paul says , ' The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord , that she may be holy in body and spirit . ' That is what I will do , Rachel  --  and it is not hard , for we have such a loving Bridegroom ! " Her mother had always had such a close and intimate walk with God that Rachel had learned more from just being around her than from all the sermons she 'd heard in church . Lydia Winslowcould pray and God would answer . Rachel had learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee or injured herself , she could run to her mother , and as she prayed and rubbed the injury , the pain went away . She never called it " healing " ; indeed , she never called it anything ; she just did it . Rachel had come to take her mother 's faith for granted , and never questioned her about it . " Well , Mother , what about me ? " Rachel asked suddenly . " I 'm going with Grandfather to the Indian Village , and you know I do n't give a pin about that . I 'm thinking a lot of Jude . "  |p106She  had always been an honest girl , and as Lydia looked into her eyes , she was thankful that her daughter had confidence enough in her to speak her heart . " He 's getting to be quite prosperous , I hear . How much land does he own now ? " " I do n't know . I told him once he just wanted all the land that joins his , and he got embarrassed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you care about , Rachel ? " Lydia asked quietly . Rachel stood there in surprise . The question had caught her off guard and it went through her quick mind . Finally she said , " I do n't know , but I want to do something ! " Lydia Winslow bit her lip , then said slowly , " That 's your father , Rachel . He was exactly like that . " " Am I like him , Mother ? " " You have some of my French impulsiveness , but it 's not that I fear . " " What then ? " Lydia gazed at her daughter steadily . " It 's the Winslow blood . Your grandfather may seem to you the most steady man in the world , but when he was your age , he was wild ! And my Matthew had the same restlessness . It sometimes skips a generation , Gilbert tells me , but you have it , Rachel  --  and that 's why I 've wanted to see you marry early . " " So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You laugh at that , but I 've seen it happen . Your father was for me all that I could ever desire  --  but the Winslow blood was strong , and  --  I lost him . I ca n't lose you , Rachel ! Not you , too ! " Rachel suddenly found her mother 's arms around her , holding to her fiercely as if to protect her from some sudden danger . Finally Lydia drew back and said gently , " Well , I 've wanted to say these things to you for a long time . Now you think I 'm just a nervous old woman worried about her only chick . " " No . " Rachel stared at her mother , and for the first time in her life , she saw her as a woman  --  not a mother , just as a woman , and it saddened her.  |p107Rachel  left the house when the east was barely tinged with the red light of dawn , and was delighted to discover John Sassamonstanding beside her grandfather , his bronzed Indian featuresa welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She ran to greet him , and in an uncharacteristic move he embraced her . It was a rare gesture ; women and men who were not related never embraced , but it was even more unusual for an Indian to show such feeling for a white woman . But John Sassamon was not a typical Indian by any means . He had been reared in a community of Christian Indians at Natick , fifteen miles west of Boston , and had studied at Harvard . Then in a crisis of identity , perhaps , he had rejoined his native Indians in the wilderness . He served as an aide to Philip Metacomet , the son of Massasoit . Philip had treasured the young man , and had broken into one of his legendary fits of fury when John had been led by the Spirit of God to return to Natick , where he was given the task of instructing young Indian converts . Rachel had practically grown up with him , for he had been assigned to study under Gilbert Winslow , and the two of them had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pastoral calls . They had sat together through the eternity-longsermons and studied the same books together , but herp108fondest memories were their times in the woods , He had made an Indian out of her , teaching her the forest arts of tracking , hunting , and a thousand other facts of the wilderness . She had cried for days when he left to go to Harvard , and beneath his stolid features she had seen that he was saddened , too . Now he stood there , embarrassed at their embrace , but with a glow of joy in his ebony eyes as he said , " You are a woman , Nahteeah . " She laughed as she heard his pet name for her , " little deer . " Gilbert said , " You two can renew your acquaintance as we travel . We 've got a long day 's journey . " The road to Middleborough , some fifteen miles southwest of Plymouth , was good enough for the cart pulled by one of Gilbert 's two horses , but past there they would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle . Rachel walked behind with John as Gilbert drove the cart , and after giving him all the news on what his old friends at Plymouth had been doing , she asked , " What are you going to do now that you 're through at Harvard , John ? " " My people at Nemasket have prospered in the Lord , Nahteeah , " he smiled . " I go to be their pastor . " " How wonderful ! " Rachel exclaimed . " That 's not so far . We 'll get to see each other often . " " That will be good , Nahteeah . I have missed you . " He laughed and said , " Do you remember when you were twelve years old and fell in love with me ? " Rachel laughed in delight at the reference . " I tried to get you to run off with me , did n't I ? And you said , ' I ca n't marry you because I 'm going to be a preacher ! ' " " What a pompous boy I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her a look and said with a peculiar tone in his voice , " You have n't chosen a husband yet , Mr. Winslow tells me . You are fourteen now , and one of our maids would be disgraced if she got to be so old without getting a husband . " Rachel looked away from him , glancing up at a squirrel chatteringangrily at the travelers for disturbing his peace . Then she said with a trace of embarrassment , " There 's plenty of time . " " Is Jude Alden still courting you ? " The question disturbed her , and she said shortly , " I see him sometimes . "  | " He does not love my people , Nahteeah , " John said quietly . " If you marry him , we could never speak to each other like this . " " He 's a good man ! If I did marry him , I would change his mind . " John gave her a sardonic smile , saying briefly , " That is the talk of a foolish woman , Nahteeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways before marriage when he is warm and eager to please her , how can she do it when he has captured her and has no need to satisfy her any longer ? " The statement troubled Rachel , and she changed the subject , but all the way to Middleborough she had turbulent thoughts about what John Sassamon had said . She had long been aware of Jude 's hatred for the Indians , but , despite her close friendship with Sassamon , had tried to ignore his attitude . His prejudice left no room for distinction between friendly and hostileIndians  --  all red men were " savages " to him . Such a perceptionwas not rare on the frontier , although there had not been an Indian war since the war against the Pequots in 1637 . But three tribes  --  the Nipmuck of Massachusetts , the Narragansett in the Bay area , and the Wampanoag led by Philip in Plymouth  --  were growing restive under the increasing pressure of white civilization . Living on the frontier was like living on a powder keg , for if war with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no militia or army to keep the tribes at bay . All morning they kept to a steady pace , stopping only briefly at noon to eat a simple meal of cold beef and bread washed down with cold water from a clear brook . They rested for less than an hour , then continued their journey , but this time Rachel rode in the cart and the two men walked in front . She listened as they talked over the matters of the ministry , and presently they spoke of the low spiritual state of Plymouth . " You young people must get tired of hearing old men say that the church here is n't what it was in our day , " Gilbert said . " But it 's true . Oh , there are little fires of true godliness breaking out in places , but I ca n't help remembering the first years here . " " Why is it so , Brother Winslow ? Why has the fire died down in the people ? " Winslow thought about the question , and finally said , " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in town situationsp110instead of having to wrest a life out of the wilderness . This generationhas never known desperate need . They grow up never knowing what it means to be imprisoned merely because they love God enough to put Him first  --  like John Bunyan . They do n't know what it 's like to have no land and no work and no say in how they are governed . It did something to us , John  --  the firstcomers , I mean  --  to live for weeks in wet misery on the open seas , then living in tents or holes in the ground , while cold and sickness ticked us off one by one . I remember one month that first year when we had to bury our dead by night so Indians would n't know how our ranks had thinned ! We ate ground nuts or grubbed for mussels to stay alive  --  and all for the sake of a vision of a Promised Land ! " John nodded . " I have often heard you say , Mister Winslow , ' God hears only desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as strong as it had been at dawn , causing Rachel to marvel again at her grandfather 's youthful body . " I fear the only way God will get the attention of our people , John , is for them to become desperate  --  as we were at the first . " " You think good times ruin the church ? " " Rev. Cotton Mather believes that . He said in a sermon last month , ' Religion begat prosperity , and the daughter devoured the mother . ' And he 's not alone , for Daniel Gookin showed me a letter from Judge Sewall , and the wise judge said , ' Prosperity is too fulsome a diet for any man  --  unless seasoned with some grains of adversity . ' " They passed through Middleborough that afternoon , and leaving the cart with a friend , proceeded on foot to Philip 's camp . It was growing late in the day when they walked into the collection of rude huts , made for the most part of saplings tied together with vines . The smell of cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once by Philip , sachem of the Wampanoags . " You have come , " he said , advancing to meet them . He held his hands palms up in the traditional Indian greeting , showing that he had no weapons . " We eat first , then talk . " They sat down in a circle inside his tent , which smelled strongly of fish , dog , and unwashed bodies , and Rachel made ap111show of eating . The food was some sort of stew in a great iron pot , and the guest simply reached in , pulled out a piece of meat or vegetable and ate it with the fingers . She avoided the meat , knowing the Indians ' weakness for young dog . She had many times seen a squaw knock a puppy on the head , dress it in a few deft movements and throw it into just such a pot ; although she had eaten such food , it never appealed to her . Philip was not physically impressive . He was small , and his slight frame was covered with stringy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a small mouth which he kept tightly shut . But he had not risen to be sachem over his tribe because of his appearance , but simply because he was by far the most intelligent of all his people . Perhaps crafty was a better word ; as Rachel studied the small Indian who was talking to her grandfather , she was struck again with the glittering eyes that illumined his face . She had always been somewhat afraid of the man , and now she felt a chill as he spoke angrily , making violent gestures with his hands . " You come like locusts , you white men , " he said staring hypnotically at the visitors . " Soon the People will have no place to put their feet . You talk about Great God in the sky , but is He only the white man 's God ? Does He not make the People as well ? " " He is the God of all men , King Philip , " Winslow answered quietly . " Then does He let one of His children rob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their sons ! He is cruel , this Jesus God ! " John Sassamon spoke up then in his clear baritone voice . " No , Jesus is not unjust . He died for the sins of all men , red and white . He longs for all His children to walk in love with one another . " Philip shot a malevolent glance at the young man , and fairly spat out his next words : " The white man robs us , takes our land and pushes us into the sea ! How can you call this love ? You have forsaken the People , and can see only the white man 's way ! " Philip 's thinly veiled hatred of Christianity , especially of the Christian missionaries who were pulling away some of his best warriors , was no secret . To Philip , John Sassamon was a turncoatp112of the vilest sort , and from that moment , he turned from the young Indian , ignoring him completely . " You have been paid for your land , King Philip , " Winslow said , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indiansnever understood ownership of land in the English sense . Their idea of signing a deed to real estate , usually in return for a specified number of axes , kettles , matchcoats , or mackinaws , was to share it with the palefaces , not to move out ; they regarded the price as rent , to be repeated every so often . Philip listened sullenly as Winslow pleaded with him , statingthe case for the white man in the fairest terms , but finally when all was said , it was obvious that the smoldering hatred in Philip was not quenched . " We must go before it gets too dark to travel , " Winslow said , and they took their leave of the surly chief , to hurry along the trail . " We 'll not get back to Middleborough by dark , " John remarked . " No , but we can stay the night with Alden , " Winslow said . They walked as fast as Rachel could go for two hours , but the sun was behind the low range of hills to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's farm . He was not expectingthem , but when they came into the clearing cut out of the large oaks where his snug house was set , he came out at Winslow 's hail . " Mr. Winslow  --  " he said , then peering behind caught sight of the two behind him . " Well , Rachel , this is a surprise . " He did not acknowledge John . Rachel went up to him and said , " Hello , Jude . Can you take in three tired travelers tonight ? You remember John Sassamon . " Alden hesitated , glaring at the Indian , then nodded . " Of course ! Come in and we 'll have some tea and a little bite of food . " They filed into the small house , and he put his musket down and busied himself with the food . He talked steadily , mostly with Winslow , but he was very conscious of his other two guests . He could not disguise his suspicion of Sassamon , and Rachel was grieved to see the covert glance of distrust he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . But he was most aware , she saw with some pleasure , of her.  |p113I  le listened to her grandfather , even made replies , but he could not keep his eyes off her . Rachel was accustomed to attention from young men , but as he poured the tea and they sat down to eat , she felt a sudden pride that he was so captivated by her . " God , we thank you for this food  --  Amen ! " Jude said quickly , and they were all caught off guard by the brevity of it . Gilbert laughed and said as he cut a slice of beef from the large portion in the platter , " That 's your grandfather speaking there , Jude . " He referred to John Alden who had courted and won Priscilla Mullins on board the Mayflower . " He was a devout man , but had no time for long prayers  --  or sermons , either ! I recall he said once to Governor Bradford 's face after a three-hour sermon , which was not one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fer goin ' to sleep , but yer should take note of the oyster . ' Well , Bradford stared at him , completely mystified , and finally he asked , ' The oyster ? Why the oyster ? ' And John looked him right in the eye and said , ' Because , sir , the beast knows when to open  --  and when to shut ! ' " Jude laughed louder than the others and said , " I believe it of him , Mr. Winslow . I miss him very much . " " So do I , Jude , " Winslow said quietly . He traced a figure on the table with his finger , then looked up and said , " They were a goodly people , the Firstcomers . " " Yourself , too , Mr. Winslow , " Alden nodded at once . " No , I was the black sheep , John . " Gilbert Winslow shook his head sadly . " I could tell you some of my sinful past that would curl your hair , if I so chose . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rachel piped up suddenly . " Please tell us about those times . " Winslow seldom spoke of his part in the settlement of Plymouth , but he did that night . He did not spare himself , for he had not been aboard the Mayflower voluntarily , but was fleeing from the King 's Justice . He told them how he had entered the service of Lord North , fleeing the life of a ministerial student at Cambridgeto pursue fame and fortune with one of England 's most powerful lords . He told of Lady Cecily North , the beautiful aristocrathe had fallen in love with , and Rachel longed to ask him more about her , but was afraid to interrupt . " I joined Bradford and the Pilgrims in Holland with one ideap114in my mind , " Gilbert said with a sad look in his fine eyes . " I was to ferret out William Brewster , one of the founders of the congregation , so I became a spy . " " A spy , sir ? I can hardly believe it ! " Alden exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human heart , " Winslow smiled . " But there is a worse thing ; I gained the love of a pure young woman in the group in order to get myself into the inner circle . " He went on to tell how when the choice had to be made , he had fought a duel with Lady North 's admirer , Lord Roth , and had killed him in a duel to protect the young woman and the congregation . " So I fled England on the same ship with the congregation , but I hated God ! " " What happened then , Grandfather ? " Winslow spoke slowly , seeming to live over the days when they had fought for survival , with what they called simply the general sickness , killing over half their number the first winter . He told how he had been profoundly influenced by the sacrificial lives of Bradford and others , and how he had finally found Jesus Christ as his Savior in a blinding blizzard , as God revealed himself . " Tell about the young woman , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put his chin on his folded hands , and thought . Finally he said , " She was the loveliest thing on God 's earth . " Then he turned his head and there were tears in his eyes as he said , " You are very much like her , Rachel . Very much . Oh , you do n't look like her at all , but her spirit has come to you . " He hesitated so long they thought he was finished ; then he said quietly , " All that was good about your father came from her  --  his generosity , his sympathy with the downtrodden , his wit  --  and all that was wrong came from me  --  from the Winslow blood ! " " No ! I do n't believe that ! " Rachel reached over and took his hands in hers , gripping them fiercely . " You must n't say that ! " The candle was guttering in the pewter holder as he finished , and he looked around in shock . " I ca n't believe it ! I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " I 'm glad you did ! " Rachel said , putting her arms around him . " It 's wonderful to have a hero for a grandfather ! " He laughed in embarrassment and got up , " Well the ' hero ' is dead on his feet . Shall I sleep in the loft , Jude ? " " Yes . Rachel can have the bedroom . But there 's only room tor two in the loft  --  " he turned a hostile eye toward Sassamon . " I will sleep in the barn , " the Indian replied impassively . Jude hesitated , then continued blandly , " I 've got to see to the new calf first . Just a few hours old , and can hardly eat . " Rachel glanced from Jude to Sassamon , whose face betrayed no hint of anger at Jude 's rudeness . She hesitated , as if making a decision , then turned back to Jude . " Let me go with you , Jude ! " she pleaded , just as he 'd known she would . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skipped over to go outside the door , calling back , " You sleep well , Gilbert Winslow ; I want to hear more about this Lady Cecily North ! " She heard her grandfather 's loud laugh as they stepped outside and took the path that led to the small hay shed fifty feet from the house . He opened the door and held the candle high so that she could see . " Oh , what a darling ! " she cried , and ran at once to stroke the tiny calf wobbling across the straw . " How beautiful ! " Jude Alden put the candle on a stool , and came to stand over her . " Yes , " he said with a smile . " A darling  --  and very beau-tiful . " She felt her cheeks grow warm , and confusion swept her . Alden reached down and pulled her to her feet , and she felt his strong arms go around her . As he pulled her close , she whispered , " No  --  Jude ! " But he said again , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time ! " She was intensely aware of his male strength as he tightened his arms , pressing her even more closely to his chest . " I think about you all the time , you know . Stuck out here by myself in this wilderness ! Every night I go to sleep thinking of you . " She began to tremble , filled with a fear of wrongdoing , but at the same time dizzy with the raging emotion that had suddenlyrisen in her . She lifted her head , and in the flickering lightp116of the candle , he saw her lips frame his name : Jude ! She felt he arms go around his neck , and she wondered at her boldness , but it was almost as if it were another , and not she herself , who was responding to his kiss . He released her slowly , and as she slipped from his arms , he said , " I 've never known a woman like you , Rachel . " She waited for him to say more , but he did not . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was something of a ladies ' man , and the thought shamed her . " I 'd better go inside , Jude , " she said quietly . Then he said , " Have you ever thought of marrying , Rachel ? " She stared at him , then said , " Every girl thinks of that . " Then the quick sense of humor came to her and she quipped , " You 'd better ask Betsy Small , Jude . Her father 's got a big farm he 's going to give for her dowry  --  big enough that you wo n't mind her being so thin ! " He smiled but said at once , " I 've got a bad reputation , have n't I , Rachel ? About women and about being ambitious . " " must confess that I 've been lax  --  but that 's over . About the second , I plead guilty . I see nothing wrong in having things . What 's wrong with that ? " " It depends on how you prosper  --  and what you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll spend it , " he smiled . " You think I 'd enjoy sitting around counting it ? No , I 'll work hard for a few more years , then I 'll live the good life  --  travel , go places , meet people ! " He had touched on a longing that she had never let another soul know of  --  her desire to travel , but she did not let a flicker of this yearning show in her eyes . Then he said , " What about you , Rachel ? What do you want ? " She bit her lip , then shrugged and said , " I do n't know , Jude . I suppose I 'm trying to find out . " He looked at her in the darkness and said , " Maybe we can help each other to find our way , Rachel . " " Maybe , Jude . " She turned and they walked out into the night ; then she went to her room and tossed fitfully on the straw mattress.  |p117The  next morning they left early and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of John 's hearing , " You decide on Jude ? " She stared at him , then laughed . " I would n't put it past you to climb out of the upstairs window and creep on your hands and knees to eavesdrop on us . " " I would if I thought it would help you , " he said simply . She took his hand and squeezed it , saying , " Tell me about Cecily North . " Then she added with an odd smile , " I do n't know about Jude . I 'll tell you as soon as I know . "  |p118Lydia  said nothing to Rachel , but for several days after her return from the Indian village , she was aware that something was troubling the girl . Finally when she and Gilbert were alone in the church after a service , she approached him about it . " You have n't said much about your trip to see King Philip , " she said as they sat down on one of the benches . " Were you discouraged about him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or later he 's going to give trou-ble . " " Rachel 's been very quiet since you came back . " " Oh , that 's a different matter , " he said . " She 's all tangled up about what to do with young Alden . They had some sort of meeting out in the barn , and she 's been all het up ever since . " " In the barn ! " He laughed and patted her shoulder . " Now , do n't get your feathers ruffled , Lydia . She told me some of it , and there 's nothing to worry about . They 're just circling around trying to decide whether to make a match of it or not . " She shook her head . " I wish she would marry him , Gilbert . " He shrugged and bit his lip . " I 'm not so sure I agree . He'sa good match , I suppose  --  he 's got land , and he 's a hard worker , but his walk with God is n't much . Pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather unchristian attitude about this Indian issue.  |p119nubs  John Sassamon dreadfully . I 'd like to see Rachel get a man ho puts God first . " They talked for a long time that night , and it was on the following Wednesday that Sassamon came by . It was late afternoon , and they did not hear his step . A knock at the door startled them all as they sat reading in the front room . " Who can that be ? " Gilbert muttered , as he went to answer it . " Well , John , come in ! " Sassamon entered and said , " Hello , Mr. Winslow  --  and how are you , Mrs. Winslow ? " " Hello , John , " Lydia smiled . " Come in , come in . " " No , I have to go see the governor right away . " He hesitated , then said , " I would like for you to go with me , Mr. Winslow . He may not believe what I have to tell him . " Gilbert looked hard at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the trouble , John ? " He shifted his weight from one foot to the other , then burstf r . " It 's Philip , sir ! " " What about him ? " " He 's organizing for war against you ! " " I knew it ! " Winslow cried . " The fool ! He 'll set the frontier on fire ! " " Will you come with me to see Governor Bradford ? " " Yes , of course , but is it certain , John ? " He pulled his coat from a peg and was shrugging into it . " How did you find out ? " " My brother , Matthew , has been to see me . He says that he was there when Philip came to his village . Philip promises that if the tribes all rise up together , the settlers will be wiped out and the land will be back in the hands of the People ! " " Come along ! " Gilbert barked , plunging out the door . " I do n't know if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better ! " Rachel and Lydia stayed up until midnight , waiting for them to come back . They had talked fearfully about the possibilities of a war , but it was late and they were sitting quietly , busy with their thoughts , when Rachel suddenly said , " I kissed Jude Alden in the barn , Mother . " Lydia almost laughed out loud at the confession ; it was much like those times when as a small child Rachel would thinkp120over some small misdeed for a long time , then come marching in to look her straight in the eye and announce it boldly . " Did you now ? " " Are you angry ? " " No , I do n't think so , " Lydia said with a smile . " Did you think I would be ? " " Oh , I suppose not . But it made me feel a little wicked , Mother . " She turned her clear hazel eyes on Lydia . " How do you know you 're in love with a man ? " " Why ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat and said , " I do n't think there 's any rule about that , Rachel . You just have to be sure you want to spend your life with him and that you respect him . " But that was not enough for Rachel , and she asked insistently , " But how did you know you were in love with my father ? " Lydia was trapped , and the pulse in her throat beat more rapidly as she said at last , " I ca n't put it into words , Rachel . You 'll just have to  --  to  --  " Rachel was staring at her mother , disappointed that there was no simple answer coming . Just as she was about to pursue the subject , they heard voices , and they got up as Gilbert and John entered . " What did he say ? " Lydia asked at once . " The governor ca n't believe that it 's so serious as John says , " Gilbert shrugged . " He wants John to keep an eye on the situation and let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry , and Rachel saw it . " There 's danger right now ! " he said grimly . " When Philip attacks , he wo n't send any announcement , I tell you ! " " I 'll work on it , John , " Gilbert said , and he put a restraining hand on the young man 's shoulder . " Governor Bradford is getting on , but I may be able to bring him around . " John shrugged . " It will have to be that way , I suppose . But be quick , Mr. Winslow . " " You 'll stay the night , " Lydia said and she went to get some cover for John . She gave it to him , and she went to bed , saying , " I 'll make you a big breakfast before you go home tomorrow . " " We will pray about it , wo n't we , John ? " Gilbert said , andp121gave the young man a firm embrace before he went to his own room . Before she left , Rachel said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought for one second that you were talking to us about this , he 'd cut your throat . " " You 're right about that . I 'll be very careful . " He turned togo with the blanket in his arms , then paused and said , " You 're very special in my heart , Nahteeah . I treasure the memory of our childhood days here more than anything else . " She stared at him , for he had always been reticent about his feelings . " I feel that way , too , John . But there 'll be more good days to come . " " I hope so , Nahteeah , " he said , then turned and left silently as a shadow . He was gone when they got up the next day , and Gilbert said ruefully , " He 's in a bad place , Lydia . I fear for the Praying Indians , converted to Christianity . They 're going to be in the middle if a war breaks out . Both sides will hate them . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lydia said , and as they spoke , Rachel felt a chill of fear , for there had been something fatalistic in John 's eyes as he had left her the previous night . Then she felt the two watching her , and Gilbert said , " It 'll be bad for Jude , too . He 's right in the middle of Philip 's territory . " He said nothing more , and the weight on her heart kept her subdued for the next few weeks . Lydia awoke and glanced carelessly at the calendar , little thinking that the date  --  April 10  --  would be any different from another day . She rose , dressed , and spent the first hour with her Bible , praying quietly while kneeling beside her bed . Then she hurried to the kitchen and put some bread in glowing coals left from the night 's baking , and by the time she had sliced the loaf , Gilbert and Rachel entered and sat down . When the simple fare was on the table , Gilbert said , " I must go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not doing well . Would you like to go with me , Lydia ? " " No , I 'll go later in the week , Gilbert . You tell her I 'll make her some of that good strong rabbit broth she likes so well . " " All right . I think I 'll stay overnight . Be back by noon to/morrow . " They bowed their heads and ate quickly . " What are you going to do today , Rachel ? " " I 'll help Mother this morning . Maybe I 'll go to see Mercy this afternoon . " Winslow gave her a sharp look , for she had been subdued , but he said nothing . After the meal he left , and the two women spent all morning cleaning house . It was almost noon when Rachel glanced out the window and said , " Why , there 's Grandfather ! I wonder why he came back ? " Lydia looked up in surprise from where she sat at the table sewing . " I ca n't imagine . Maybe he changed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " What broughtyou back  --  ? " The words were cut off as if a noose had tightened aroundher neck . The man who stood there was not her grandfather  --  but so like him she was speechless ! He stood there , his bright blue eyes searching her face calmly , and he had the same wedge-shaped face , the same broad cheekbones and wide mouth as Gilbert Winslow  --  only this man was in the prime of life . Lydia looked up to see why Rachel had broken off , and when she saw the two standing there , a fear ran through her. it She rose and went quickly to the door . " What 's wrong , Gilbert ? " She had no doubt that it was her father-in-law , for he had the same tall frame , and the shape of his head was so like Gilbert'sthat it never entered her mind as she stepped forward that it was anyone but him . Rachel stepped to one side , her eyes fixed on the man . He took one step forward and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brilliant sunshine and Lydia saw his features clearly for the first time . Her hand flew to her mouth and she felt terribly sick . She heard her heart pounding fast and hard , and the room seemed to sway . She closed her eyes and almost fell , but Rachel caught her , crying out , " Mother ! " and she backed away from the door until the edge of the table caught her . There was a sudden silence , and the three of them seemed to be frozen in place  --  or like a picture painted on a canvas . Lydia knew that as long as she lived she would see that scene : the brilliantp123April sun streaming through the windows highlighting myriads of dust motes that swarmed madly as if to escape the shaft of light Rachel , pale as old ivory , staring at the tall man who had stepped inside and stood looking at her across the small room . " I 've  --  come back . Lydia . " She tried to speak , but her inouth was so dry she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , the sound was harsh and brittle , cutting the intense silence . " I  --  we thought  --  you were  --  dead ! " Rachel gave a small cry , and Lydia saw the fear scoring her pale face . She moved quickly to stand beside the girl . Rachel placed an arm around her mother as if to steady her , but she herself was faint and dizzy with shock . Matthew , too , was trembling , his ruddy face , burned with the sun , gray with strain . But he swallowed hard , his words coming slowly . " You need to sit down , both of you . " He grabbed a chair in each hand and shoved them toward the two women , saying , " Please  --  sit down , Lydia ! " Lydia sat down heavily , for the shock of his appearance had robbed her of strength . She had seen a man almost sever his foot with an ax , and she had had the same lightheaded feeling as the scarlet blood had pumped out on the white snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nothing came . Her thoughts rolled wildly through her mind , but as she sat there , her breathing became more even , and she could feel her racing pulse slow to a normal rate . She opened her eyes , took a deep breath , and carefully looked at her husband 's face , repeating , " We thought you were dead . " " I thought of sending you word that I was coming , but Ihad no one to send . " Lydia stared at him ; then she looked up at Rachel . " This is your father , Rachel . " The two looked at each other , and neither spoke . Finally he said , " You are beautiful  --  " He broke off , bit his lip and said , " I 'd like to sit down myself , if you do n't mind . " He stood there , and for all the strength he radiated , a vulnerabilityfilled his face  --  a slight movement in his broad lips , just a trace of uncertainty in his clear blue eyes . Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not move , but stood there as if he expected to be ordered out of the houseLydia nodded . " Of course . " She watched as he pulled the third chair from the table and sat down . There was something ; eerie about him , for he was not the eighteen-year-old she had pictured in her mind for years , but a heavier man , stronger , with an assurance and steadiness in his gaze that was foreign to her memories of him as a youth . There was an air of authority in him , as if he were accustomed to being obeyed , yet his face bore a look of simple humility . His hands were brown and corded with muscle , and as he moved there was a suggestion of tremendouspower , ready to leap into action at an instant 's notice . He had a white scar that began over his right eyebrow and disappeared into his thick hair , and another on the side of his neck shaped like a fishhook . He was dressed in knee breeches and boots , a waistcoat of dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver buttons . His shirt was of white linen ; he held a felt hat with a wide brim and high crown . There was nothing to mark him as to profession , but the clothes , though not new , had been expensive . He let the silence run on as the women stared at him , enduringit quietly , and not taking his own eyes off them . " I know it 's a shock , my walking in like this . " He hesitated then said very quietly , " You ca n't know how I 've longed to see you all these years , Lydia . " " But  --  we thought you were dead ! " He stared at her , then nodded . " I suppose that would be natural enough , not hearing from me all this time . But I could n't write ! " Lydia twisted her hands together , trying to conceal the trembling , but the anger in her voice betrayed her as she said , " You let me think all these years that you were lost at sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lifting his head . " Why would you think that ? " She stared at him in disbelief , and her lips grew pale as she pressed them together . " You left on that whaling ship  --  I 've forgottenits name  --  but it went down with all hands ! " His mouth dropped open , and he tried to speak , but the words would not come . Finally he swallowed and said , " As God is my witness , Lydia ! I never once thought ! Why , I was signed top125go on the Intrepid  --  but at the last moment I changed my mind and took a berth aboard a schooner headed for Africa . I never knew  --  not until this minute  --  that the whaling vessel sank ! " He got to his feet and began to pace nervously back and forth , twistinghis head to one side in a familiar motion that Rachel had seen in Gilbert Winslow a thousand times . " By all that 's holy , I never thought of such a thing  --  not once ! " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost mad , Lydia , in that prison , you must remember how my mind was going . " " I  --  remember , " she said slowly , her eyes cold as steel . " That day , the day I sent for the justice , I was in a fever , maybe you remember that , too ? It seemed to burn what little will I had out of my soul ! So when I signed the paper promising to never preach again , I was numb . I think I went mad . I rememberBunyan trying to talk to me , but it was like  --  it was like I was under water , in a way . I was moving slowly , and I could n't see through the haze . " " Why did n't you come home ? " Lydia demanded , and such pain filled her eyes that he bit his lip and looked away . " Oh , why did n't you just come home , Matthew ? " " I wanted to , Lydia  --  and that was where I started . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew you and Father would never understand what I had done ! I suppose if I had been rational , I might have done it , but all I could think of was the shame of it ! So I wandered around for a while , and then the idea just came to me  --  to leave the country and get away from it all . " He stopped , finding it difficult to explain . Pulling a hand- ' kerchief from his pocket , he wiped the perspiration from his brow . " That 's what I did , Lydia , " he began again in a hoarse voice . " I went to the house , got my clothes and some money  --  then I got on the coach and left Bedford . Could n't bear seeing you . " Breathing heavily , Lydia waited for him to continue , but he said nothing more . Finally she asked , " And then ? Where have you been all these years ? " As he turned to face her , she saw something in his eyes she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't tell you now . You would not be proud of my life for the past fourteen years , Lydia . " Anger suddenly coursed through her and she got to her feet.  | " And that 's your explanation for deserting your wife and child ? " He flinched , but faced her blazing eyes steadily . " If there were a reason for my behavior , Lydia , do n't you suppose I 'd give it ? But I have none . " He straightened his heavy shoulders and implored , " I 've come to ask for your forgiveness , Lydia  --  and for yours , daughter  --  but do n't ask me to account for my life ! Forgiveme  --  that 's my only request . " Lydia stared at him for several minutes , and then she began to tremble violently . Rachel watched , dumbfounded , for she had never seen her mother lose control . " Forgive you ! " Lydia spat out . " Just like that , Matthew Winslow , you expect to walk back into our lives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Winslow 's head jerked as if he had been physically struck . " I can understand , Lydia  --  " " Understand ? You understand nothing ! " she interrupted . " Once I thought you dead , I was free from the anguish of your desertion . I could go on with life , forgive your memory , give myself to God . But here you are again , and  --  " Lydia stopped short , her face flushed . She breathed deeply once or twice , fought for control , then finished in a whisper , " Sin it may be , Matthew , but I can not pretend to forgive you when my heart can not accept you . I  --  I ca n't think clearly  --  " He got up at once . " I do n't wonder . " He picked up his hat and stood , a tall shape against the sun that caught him in a yellow beam . He started to speak , then shrugged . Rachel saw a dark look of fatalism cloud his eyes . He looked at the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He 's gone to Langley , " Rachel said . " He 'll be back tomorrowat noon . " " I 'll be on board the Carrington , just offshore , " he stated . " If he will see me , tell him to send word . " " I 'll tell him ... " She paused , not knowing how to address him . He gave her a slight smile and said , " You are indeed lovely , Rachel . " Then he wheeled and left without another word . Rachel watched him walk rapidly down the street until he was out of sight . She turned to look at Lydia , and said , " Mother  --  I ca n't believe it ! "  |p127Lydia  whispered , " Nor I , child . " She walked over to the door and stood looking down the street . Then she turned , her shoulderssagging , and she began to weep . " Mother ! Are you all right ? " Rachel ran to her mother and held her close . For a long time great sobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep breath , wiped her eyes , and pulled away . " I must go to Gilbert , " she said numbly . " I 'll go with you ! " " Rachel  --  would you mind if I went alone ? " Rachel sensed that there was a need in her mother that only Gilbert Winslow could meet , so she said , " Of course . You 'll have to hurry to get there before dark . " Ten minutes later Lydia stood at the door and in an unexpectedmove embraced Rachel , then said , " How do you feel , Rachel ? I wo n't leave you if . . . " " I 'm fine , Mother , really . It 's just so strange  --  to have a fa-ther . " Lydia glared at Rachel . " You do n't have a father . Matthew Winslow gave up all rights to that name when he ran away fourteenyears ago ! " " I suppose so  --  but it 's different . " Rachel shook her head . " No matter what he 's done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said gently , " Rachel , I have done my grieving over your father . To me he died before you were born . Now he comes back and begs for forgiveness . I hardly know how to forgive him . But I will not let him hurt me again  --  nor you ! " " Yes , Mother , " Rachel said quietly . " You must hurry ; it 'll be dark by the time you get there . " " We 'll be home early in the morning . " Rachel watched her mother until she was out of sight , then stood there , uncertain and filled with such emotion that she could not be still . She threw on a coat , and all afternoon she walked the shore , looking often at the ship that lay offshore , thinking of the tall man who had appeared out of the past . " My father . " She said the title aloud as she continued to look at the vessel until darkness began to descend . The fog soon swallowedthe ship , making it invisible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , filled with an emotion she could not identify  --  a mixture of hope , joy  --  and fear !  |p128Rachel  slept no more than the barn owl that kept calling all night . For three hours she tossed about on her bed , then finally rose and dressed . Her mind was confused , filled with wild thoughts and an emotion she could not define . She had long ago accepted the fact that she had no father , but for him suddenly to appear made her somehow angry . He could have come home before this ! she thought as she waited for Gilbert and Lydia to arrive . If he had loved me and my mother , he would have come ! By the time she heard the footsteps approaching the house , the hurt and bitterness had taken a firm hold of her mind . She opened the door , and saw at a glance that neither of them had slept . Gilbert 's face was pinched in a way she had never seen it , for he was a cheerful man , never gloomy ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embrace her . " You look tired , Rachel , " he said quietly . " I did n't sleep much . You two did n't either , from the looks of you . I 've got some tea ready . " She sat them down and as she poured the tea , she said , " It 's hard for me  --  but much worse for both of you . " Gilbert took the tea , stirred it slowly with his spoon , then tried to smile . " I feel very guilty , you know . Here is my only son come back from the grave , and I 've not been giving God the glory . "  |p129Lydia  sat down wearily , looked out the window where the morning sun was beginning to warm the earth . She shook her head and said , " Matthew is alive  --  not dead , and I feel soso ... " Gilbert gazed at her steadily and said , " It will take a while , my dear . " He sipped his tea , adding , " I 've sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But  --  what are you going to say to him ? " Rachel asked , frustration mirroring her usually cheery face . Her full lips narrowedunder the pressure , as she continued . " He ca n't expect to just step back into our lives as if nothing happened ! I ca n't just smile at him and say , ' Father , I 'm so glad you 're home , ' can l ? " Gilbert stared at his cup , then looked up at her . " I hardly think he expects that , Rachel . But I know what you mean . " Nervouslyhe bit his lip , then added , " Let 's wait until we talk to him before we try to make any decisions or form any judgments . " The next hour was a strain as each tried to occupy himself . But none mentioned Matthew 's name . Then as Lydia looked out the window she cried , " Here he comes ! " They all stiffened . Followingthe knock at the door , Gilbert moved stiffly forward , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps into the room , paused , then meetingGilbert 's gaze , said quietly , " Hello , Father . " The two women did not move nor speak , for they were caught by the tension that filled the room . Both of them looked at Gilbert 's face , now masking his emotions . Gilbert Winslow was not a man to hide his feelings ; that was one of his charms . His expressive features reflected his moods , for he had not formed the habit of concealing his emotions . When he was angry , his bright eyes blazed with a fury that most men could not match , and when he was filled with joy , the light on his face made all who saw him glad . But now his impassive face revealed no emotion . " Matthew , " he began , " this is a glad day for me . Welcome home . " The words were cordial , perhaps , but they were spoken in a careful , guarded tone , with little warmth . Matthew 's face , bronzed with an eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sudden light of expectancy thatp130had lurked in his eyes and on his lips . At his father 's words , his face had gone still , and he bit his lip , nodding slightly . " Thant. you , sir . " It was all so formal , painfully so , that Lydia said quickly , " Come in and sit down . " " Thank you . " He moved toward the table , sat down and folded his hands on the table . Gilbert sat down opposite him , but the two women remained standing . Gilbert looked his son in the face and said , " You 're looking well . " Then he suddenly struck the table and cried , " Matthew , why  --  ! " " Father , wait ! " Matthew implored , twisting his head to one side . The memory of that mannerism raked hard across Gilbert 's nerves , and he knew for a long time he would be seeing and hearing things he had forgotten . Matthew suddenly smiled , and though it was a bitter-sweet expression , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds at ease  --  all three of you . You 're all in a state of shock  --  and you 're all angry with me  --  " He held up his hand as Gilbert started to speak , and raised his voice as he said , " How could it be otherwise ? You are angry , Father , because I ran away from duty . Lydia , how could you not be bitter with a man who desertedyou ? And you , Rachel , how can you possibly accept a stranger as a father  --  a man who 's never done one thing for you that a real father would have done ? " The words struck all three of them like musket balls . Gilbert finally spoke , his voice edged with agitation and a trace of wonder . " You have picked up some discernment along the way . " This time a smile touched the corners of his mouth and he said , " In my case you are correct  --  but I will expect that as we spend time together , I will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Matthew said quietly , " You need have no fear that I 've come to move into your lives . " At his words a look of surprise swept across Lydia 's face , but he did not see it . " It took me two years to convince myself even to come back . I was ashamed , of course , and I had decided that whatever else I did , the one thing I would not be guilty of was inflicting more pain on you . " " What changed your mind  --  Matthew ? " Lydia asked . Shep131seemed to have trouble pronouncing his name , but the shock of his presence was lessening , and the tense lines on her face had softened . He hesitated , then gave a smile tinged with embarrassment . " I 'll tell you  --  but it sounds so weak , I 'd not expect you to believe it . " " I 'd like to hear whatever part of your life you will tell us , Matthew , " Gilbert encouraged him . " Lydia informs me it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but I think we deserve to know something ! You owe us that , I think . " Matthew bit his lip , then shrugged , saying , " Certainly . Father , if you want to know , I 'll tell you . " He got up and began to pace the floor , and his gait , his every movement brought back to Lydia and Gilbert the young man they had last seen fourteen years earlier . " As I told Lydia , I was delirious when I left the jail , and you remember that my mind was in bad shape at that time . The ship was bound for Africa , but for most of that long voyage , I was so ill they kept me in the hold , pretty much expecting me to die . Perhaps you do n't know this , but England and Spain are in stiff competition with one sort of merchandise  --  black slaves from Africa . Well , the Eagle made a good haul , but she was overtaken by a Spanish man-of-war and impounded as contraband . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board was tried and found guilty of smuggling ! " Matthew gave them a curious look , then said , " I was in a Spanish prison for nearly six years  --  which is as close to hell on earth as you 'll find on this planet ! " " I 've heard something of it , " Gilbert responded . " It 's a miracleyou 're alive at all , from what 's said of such places . " " I would n't be if I had n't escaped . There was a prisoner named Rolfe , Isaac Rolfe . He 'd been a soldier , a pirate , and just about everything else  --  but he got us out of that prison ! " " What did you do then ? " Rachel asked suddenly . She had been watching her father pace the floor , and there was a burning desire to know all about him . " Why , I joined with Rolfe , " he shrugged . " And for the next six years we did all manner of things that men in our condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fortune '  --  whichp132was a fancy way of saying we would fight on any side for any cause if there was enough gold in it for us . " He paused and hi , , brow furrowed as he thought ; then he added , " I must have been in half a dozen armies , and most of the time I did n't even ask what the war was about . " " There are worse things than being a soldier , " Lydia said . " Yes , there are , and I managed to discover one , " Matthew said bitterly . " Trading in human flesh  --  that was my next fine profession ! I joined with Rolfe to buy a schooner and we made the trip to Africa time after time , but it never failed to make me sick . We packed them in so thickly on the ship they had to sleep hugging each other , like spoons pressed together . And when the plague would break out in the hold , they 'd die like flies ! We 've thrown them over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , babies  --  ! " He walked to the window and leaned on the sill , staring out at the green grass and the swaying hills . He stood there so long that he seemed to have forgotten them . Finally Gilbert gave a quick glance at Lydia and cleared his throat . " What happened then ? " " What ? Oh , I took it as long as I could  --  " Matthew turned and looked at them with an odd light in his blue eyes . " Finally I sold my share of the ship to Rolfe and cleared out . I had enough money so that I could go anywhere , and for a few months I just wandered around , looking for something  --  but I could n't find any peace . " He smiled at Gilbert and said , " Here 's the part you wo n't believe . It sounds too much like a bad story . You see , ever since those days in that Spanish prison , something you told me once kept coming back . You may not remember it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Edward and I were leaving for England , you and mother were there . It was the last time I ever saw her . " " I remember very well , " Gilbert said quietly . " Do you remember that you started down the ladder , and you called out to me : ' Be faithful to God , Matthew  --  never fail Him ! Be true to God  --  and to yourself ' ? " " Yes , I said that . " " Well , those words came to me all the years I was in prison ,  |p133and  even while I was serving the devil in the wars and in the slave trade . But when I finally cut all my ties with Rolfe and was alone with nothing to do , those words got even stronger . I tell you , it was like losing my mind  --  the way they kept ringing in my ears ! So then  --  and here 's what I find hard to say to you ... " He seemed so embarrassed that Gilbert said , " Go on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then continued in a quiet ' voice charged with emotion . " I went back to England with no purpose , but one day I suddenly decided to go back to Bedford . It was like a dream when I got there , seeing the little house where we lived , Lydia  --  and the jail , of course ! I found out Pastor Gifford had gone on , but you know about John Bunyan ? " " Yes . " Gilbert smiled for the first time . " He 's become quitea famous preacher since his release three years ago . In great ' demand all over England . And he and Elizabeth have two childrenof their own now ! " " Yes , I know , " Matthew said . " I stayed with them for six months . He has n't changed , John has n't . The years in prison just made him pure gold ! But now I have to tell you both  --  I was a lost sinner when I went to stay with the Bunyans , but through their love and kindness  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed very difficult for him , and he laughed shortly . " I told you it would sound like a bad piece of fiction . Sinner gets converted and runs for his father 's house  --  after ruining the lives of the three people he loves most . " Matthew got up , wheeled and started for the door . He paused , turned and added roughly , " I wo n't trouble you , you may be sure of that ! " His departure was so sudden that they were stunned . Gilbertcalled out , " Wait  --  ! " But he was gone . " I  --  I do n't understand , Gilbert , " Lydia said in bewilderment . " Why should he be so  --  so ashamed to tell us he 's become a Christian ? " " It sounds too easy for him , I think , " Gilbert said slowly , rubbing his chin thoughtfully . " I can see how he feels , ca n't you ? He behaved shamefully , and now his pride wo n't let him believe that all he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it real ? His conversion , I mean ? " Gilbert turned to look at Rachel , then answered , " I don'tp134know , but in a way , it 's just as well he feels this way . It will give us all time to think , to try and sort this out . " " But , what will he do ? " Lydia asked . " I think , " Gilbert murmured softly , " he 'll spend a lot of time showing us that he 's found God  --  instead of telling us ! " Matthew 's words on leaving  --  I wo n't trouble you , you may 1,1. sure of that !  --  were followed so strictly that for the next month it was almost as if his sudden appearance had been a dream ! He did not return to the Winslow house , and they had to learn of his movements from others . " The gentleman with your name , Pastor Winslow , he 's your relation , is he ? " Martin Tillotson asked one day as Gilbert stopped by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , a small , polite man , very regular in his church attendance . He smiled and said , " I could see the resemblance between the two of you  --  a fine looking man he is , too , like yourself , if I may say so . " " Yes , Brother Tillotson , " Gilbert said quickly . " He 's my son . How did you happen to meet him ? " " Why , he took a room here last week , Pastor  --  but he 's been gone since that first day . Said he 'd not be in much . He did n't mention his business . " Gilbert did n't take the broad hint , for not knowing himself what Matthew was doing , he could not very well answer the innkeeper . He repeated the conversation to Lydia and Rachel . They too were perplexed . " Why did he come here if he was intending to leave so soon ? " Rachel asked sharply . " Everyone knows about it . Mercy asked me right out , ' Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was I to say ? The whole thing makes me feel so  --  awkward ! " All three of them felt that way the next Sabbath Day , when Matthew walked in and took a back seat in the small church . It was a small town , and every stranger was subjected to minute examination , but Matthew 's appearance sent a hum of whisperingaround the congregation , and several members were in danger of dislocating their necks trying to swivel around and catch a glimpse of the visitor . Lydia 's cheeks burned . Rachel turned to her mother andp135whispered , " We ca n't bear this , Mother ! " Gilbert took in the avid interest , noting the embarrassment on the faces of Rachel and Lydia . His own face was paler than usual , but he rose and called the congregation to order as if nothing had happened . They sang and several members gave interpretations of scriptures ; then Gilbert preached for an hour . No one dared to turn and stare at Matthew during the sermon , except Mrs. Lawson , who would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the congregation were not directed at their visitor , their interest surely was . Gilbert concluded the sermon , but instead of closing with a final prayer , he said in a steady voice , " We have a guest in our congregation this morning , my son , Matthew . Some of you who have been here for a long time will remember him . He was presumedto be dead for many years  --  but God in His mercy preservedhim . I ask you to welcome him back , and to join his wife and his daughter in thanking God for His tender mercies . " Then he prayed , and afterward several of Matthew 's old friends approached him eagerly . Matthew 's teacher , in his eighties , but with eyes as sharp as a bird 's , greeted the tall man , so unlike the small boy he had known . " Thank God , my boy ! I thank God ! " he exclaimed , giving him a hearty grip of the hand . " I 've never forgotten you , never ! It cut me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for all these years I 've had fond memories of those days when you came to my house  --  such a bright little chap ! " Then he suddenly reached out and embraced Matthew , weeping and patting him on the arm . Matthew looked over the old man 's head at Gilbert , his eyes misty as he said , " Why , that 's good of you , Mr. Morrison  --  and just like you ! I 've thought of you often . " Others came , and those who had moved to Plymouth after his presumed death came to be introduced . It was a strange moment for Matthew , who stood there receivingthe greetings of old friends and others , feeling like an imposter . But it would not have been quite so difficult if Mrs. Lawson had not raised her voice , saying loudly , " Well , now , Lydia Winslow ! What will it be like to have a husband again after all these years ? " Lydia flinched slightly at the impertinent question , but shep136managed to smile . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that God has seen fit to preserve my husband . " Then the awkward moment passed , and the crowd began to leave . Gilbert walked over immediately and said , " I 'm glad you came , son . " " We  --  expected you to come back , " Lydia said with some hesitation . Matthew gave her a direct look , then shook his head . " As I said , Lydia , I 'll not be a trouble to you . " Rachel had moved to stand beside Lydia . " Well , you ca n't just ignore us ! " she said sharply . Matthew smiled at her . " Rachel , I realize how awkward it is  --  especially for your mother  --  but I 'm leaving Plymouth today , so people will have to just wonder about our family . " " Leaving ! " Lydia said quickly . " But  --  where are you going ? " " I was going to stop by and tell you about it before I left , but  --  " " Come and have a bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will look odd if you do n't  --  and besides , I want to hear your plans . " They ate cold beef and bread , their usual Sabbath noonday meal , and Matthew related his plan . " There 's a big market for beaver in England . I 'm going into the trading business . As a matter of fact , I brought a wagon load of trade goods with me from England . I 'll be gone for a few weeks ; then when I get a shipment , I 'll come back and put them on a ship here at Plym-outh . " All three of them realized it was more than a business venture ; he was taking himself out of Plymouth to remove some of the pressure from the three of them . " Matthew , " Gilbert said , " you do n't have to do this on our account  --  " " It will be best , I think , " Matthew broke in , " if I 'm gone for a time . Give people time to get used to the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'll have to go permanently , sooner or later , you know . There 's no other way . " These weeks since Matthew 's sudden appearance had not been easy on anyone . All three had wondered how he could fit into their lives . It would not do for him to remain at the inn , separated from his wife and daughter . In Plymouth that wasp137simply not done , and in any case , it would have put an intolerablestrain on all of them . Breaking the awkward silence , Matthew stated , " I 'll call when I get back in a few weeks . " He left , and although the village had not stopped speculatingabout the strange and sudden appearance , by the middle of June most of them had given up trying to ferret the truth of the affair from the family . Lydia lost weight , Rachel noted , and was much quieter than usual as she went about her work at home and tended to the many charities she pursued . Rachel wanted to speak about her father to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort of inner journey and would only say , " We must continue to pray about it , " when she brought the subject up . On the last of June John Sassamon suddenly appeared , full of news . Arriving at the cottage , his first words to Rachel were , " I 've been with your father ! " Rachel eagerly pumped the young Indian for information , and discovered that her father had gone to John 's village . The two had met and become fast friends ; Sassamon could not speak highly enough of Matthew . " He is a good man , Nahteeah ! As good as his father ! " That was high praise , indeed , from the Indian ! He went on to add , " He is the most honest trader my people have ever met , but the other traders are very angry with Mr. Matthew because he gives a fair price and does not rob the People ! And he is as good as an Indian in the woods , Nahteeah ! I have traveled with him and he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his words , and Sassamon asked suddenly , " What is wrong between Mr. Matthew and you , Rachel ? " " Why , nothing , John ! " " That is the first lie you have told me in a long time ! " She bit her lip , ashamed to be dishonest with him , then said , " It is an old thing , John . My father did a bad thing years ago , and it still lies between us , I suppose . " " That is bad  --  for he is a good Christian , " Sassamon said vigorously . " I am disappointed for the first time with Pastor Winslow . He should thank God he has such a good son  --  and you and your mother  --  you have a good husband and father . "  |p138Rachel  had no answer , and John said , " I must go to GovernorBradford now . " " Is it bad news again , John ? " " Not good ! Philip is trying to get the other tribes more unhappywith white men . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think it will come soon , " he added . " You must be very careful , John , " Rachel continued . " He will kill you if he even suspects you are talking to the authori-ties . " He shrugged , " Do not worry about me , Nahteeah . " Then he smiled , saying earnestly , " You must learn to love your father . " Then he was gone as quickly as he had come . His visit left Rachel so shaken she could not concentrate on her work . She went to the beach , walking the rocky shores and thinking , wondering if John was right . " But I do n't hate my father , " she protestedto herself . Even as she spoke the words , she knew she was being dishonest . I 've never forgiven him for deserting me and mother ! she admitted . She walked home slowly , unhappy with herself . When she arrived , her mother had come back , so she went to where she was sitting outside in the sun . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What is it , Rachel ? " Rachel hesitated , then said with a vigorous gesture of her head , " I  --  I ca n't feel right about my father ! " she said . " No matter how hard I try , I still ca n't  --  can't --  " " You ca n't forgive him , Rachel , is that it ? " " Yes  --  but I want to , Mother ! Why is it so hard ? " Lydia shook her head , and looked out at the sea before she said with bitterness in her voice , " I 'm having the same trouble , Rachel . And it 's pride  --  nothing more . We 've been hurt , and we wo n't be satisfied until he suffers as we have ! " Rachel looked at her mother in amazement , for she had never known of Lydia bearing a grudge . " But , Mother  --  surely you do n't feel that way ! " Lydia suddenly put her fist to her mouth , pressing hard , and Rachel knew that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes ! I feel that way  --  and God forgive me ! But He wo n't , Rachel , because the Bible says that if we wo n't forgivep139those who 've wronged us , God will not forgive us ! " Rachel said slowly , " I want to forgive him  --  but I just ca n't ! " Lydia stared at her daughter and then before she rose to go into the house , she said slowly , " We 're finding out something about ourselves , are n't we , Rachel ? God blesses us with a miracle  --  andwe throw it back in His face ! I wonder how we will pray when we need God ? And I wonder if He 'll say , ' I gave you a blessing and you rejected it  --  now you provide your own miracles ! ' " Rachel watched her mother go inside . The rest of the afternoon she went slowly about her work , mechanically and duly , unable to forget her mother 's words . Whom would I call on if I needed a miracle ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slight breeze that stirred the trees and the far-off cry of a curlew.  |p140Jude  Alden was a contented man . He leaned against the rail fence and gazed off into the distance , savoring the knowledge that every blade of grass and every tree as far as the eye could see belonged to him . He glanced down at Rachel , then raised his arm and indicated a low rise of hills off in the distance . " There 's where the new plot begins  --  see ? There  --  by that line of timber off to the left . " " How many acres did you say ? " " Over three hundred in the whole tract . " Jude chuckled deep in his chest , and a broad smile crossed his lips as he said , " Old Taylor thought he 'd do me in on the swap  --  but I knew if I held out , he 'd get greedy and make a snatch for that worthless piece I traded for this . I let word get out that the new road to the north was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Taylor thought I did n't know it . Why , it was enough to make a dog laugh , Rachel , the way he came up so innocent and offered to trade me this place ! It was like taking candy away from a baby , I tell you ! " Rachel looked up with an uneasy smile at Alden as they walked back along the trail to his house . She was sure her grandfather would never approve of his methods . Besides , she could never understand the pleasure he got in trading , and now she asked curiously , " Does n't your conscience ever hurt , Jude ? Ip141mean , you traded the old man a worthless piece of rocky ground for one of the best farms in the area . " He stared at her in surprise , and the blank look on his face showed that he had never once considered such a thing a moral issue . He studied how to explain it to her , his sharp-featured face expressive . " Why , I 'd not treat a widow or an orphan this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading with me , he 'd best watch out for himself . It 's just a game , you see , Rachel ? I try to best him and he tries to best me  --  and that 's the fun of it ! " She thought about it , but her own sense of right and wrong was too limited to render judgment , so she shrugged and said , " Well , you own it , Jude  --  all this land . But I can enjoy the trees  --  and the birds sound just as sweet to me with their singing as they do to you . " He said little more as they made their way back to the cabin . Finally he smiled and said , " Now , you 're a woman , Rachel , and not able to think about business like a man . And that 's all right with me . I do n't want a wife to do the trading in the family . " " What do you want from a wife , Jude ? " she asked mischievously . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusionsweep across his regular features . He suddenly stopped , pulled her around and kissed her resoundingly . His lips were cold in the December chill , and the bulky clothes they both wore hindered him . " I guess I want a wife for that for one thing ! " he laughed , then kissed her again , holding her soft form tightly until she pulled away . " Come on , I 'll race you back to the house ! " She took off running , and was so light and fleet of foot that he did not catch up to her until they turned into the clearing where his house sat . She stopped suddenly and was not even breathing hard as she said , " You 've got company . " She lifted her hand to shield her eyes from the bright winter sun and bit her lip , adding , " It 's my father and John Sassamon . " He gave her an odd look . Then as they walked across the open field he said , " Nobody in Plymouth understands about your family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on , " Your father came out of nowhere eight months ago . He does n't live with you and your mother . He runs all over the country with those savages , and I suppose he 's made a fortune in beaver byp142this time . But  --  you never say a word about him . " " It 's a family problem , Jude . " Rachel shrugged and added only , " There was a falling out years ago , between him and my mother . " Jude shook his head . " I do n't like to say anything about your family , Rachel , but it 'd be a tragedy if your mother took him back . " " Why do you say that ? " She lowered her voice , for they were less than a hundred feet away from the house . " My grandfathersays he 's a changed man . " " Changed from what ? " Jude asked instantly . " This country is on the verge of an Indian war , Rachel . Philip is a madman ! And your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the Praying Indians he 's with most , Jude . He 's working with Reverend Eliot a great deal . " " Praying Indians ! " Jude muttered . " When the trouble comes , there 'll just be one kind of Indian ! You 'll see . And your friend Sassamon will be right with them ! " Rachel had argued this with Jude many times , but it was hopeless ; Alden , like many of the settlers who lived in the wildernessareas , had no confidence in any Indian . Sassamon stepped forward , saying , " Hello , Rachel . " She took his hand and gave him a warm smile . " This is a surprise , John . Hello , Father . You 're looking thin . " She took his hand also , and thought about the many months it had taken for her to do a simple thing like calling Matthew Winslow " father . " He had been to their house exactly four times over the past eight months , never staying the night anywhere except in the inn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of them had been able to feel very comfortable , though outwardly they appeared to be . " We 're like a bunch of porcupines ! " Gilbert had exclaimed in disgust one evening after Matthew left the house . " We just seem to be full of spines that keep poking somebody else in tender places ! " " Well , " Lydia said , " it 's not as bad as it was . We can sit down and talk now , at least . " " That 's just , wonderful , is n't it ? " Gilbert had growled . " I 'm actually able to sit down and talk with my own son ! "  |p143For  the first time in her life , Rachel had flared up at her grandfather . " Well , you 're as bad as she is ! He comes here and sits and you talk about nothing but some idiotic sermon ! It would n't kill you to bend a little and say a kind word to the poor man , would it ? " Gilbert and Lydia had stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe you 're right , Rachel , but there 's some deep wounds in our past . Scars that do n't heal all at once . But what about you ? I do n't notice as how you 're sitting on his lap , and if you said one warm kind thing to Matthew tonight , I missed it ! " Lydia had stopped the quarrel , saying , " We 're all guilty , Gilbert . The next time he comes , I  --  I 'll be more  --  gentle . " Now , standing there in the cold air , that scene flashed back to Rachel , and she made herself smile at Matthew . " We 've been disappointed that you 've not been back to the house . " Matthew 's face changed suddenly , and a warmth appeared in his bright blue eyes . " Why , thank you , Rachel . I 've thought of you every day . " Jude said , " Where you headed , Mr. Winslow ? " " John and I thought we 'd make a sweep around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can trap in , in the spring . " Jude frowned . " I 'd be careful if I were you . You know how jealous Philip is of his territory . " " Philip wo n't mind if we take a few beaver , Alden , " Matthewsaid easily . " Indians do n't mind sharing things . " Jude grew defensive then , for Winslow was actually saying that settlers such as himself made the Indians go on the warpath . " Well , I been hearing that the tribes are restless . You hear about the attack on that farm in Bennington ? " " Bunch of wild young boys drunk on whiskey , " John Sassamonanswered . " They were n't Wampanoags , either . " He turned and said , " I 'll be back this way in three days , Mr. Winslow . Where can we meet ? " " Why , right here , if Alden does n't mind . " " Of course . " There was not a great deal of warmth in Jude 's voice , but he could not refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are here for a visit . You 'll be wel-come . " " Lydia did n't come ? " Matthew asked Rachel . " Oh , yes . She and Grandfather are over at Pageville . There 's a little church there having a struggle and they visit when they can to try to help out . " " You 'll stay for supper , Mr. Winslow ? " Jude asked . " Yes , please do , Father , " Rachel said quickly . There had been a cold formality in Jude 's voice , and she had seen Matthew start to shake his head . He was surprised at her insistence . " Why , I think I will . " John was not included in the invitation , but as he left , he whispered to Rachel . " That 's my good girl ! You honor your father and you 'll live a long time , like the scripture says ! " He started to leave , then paused and said so softly she almost missed it , " God love you , Nahteeah  --  you 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left on silent steps and disappeared into the line of trees to the east of the house . Rachel spent most of the afternoon cooking , and to her surprise , Jude and her father walked around the farm talking , apparentlycontent with each other 's company . Jude was making an attempt , she saw , to get to know her father , and it gave her a warm feeling to see it . Gilbert and Lydia got back just as the sun , white as if frozen by the raw winter wind , slipped behind the tall oaks . They came inside the house and as they took off their heavy coats , Rachel said , " Did you know Father is here ? " Lydia stopped abruptly , turned and said quickly , " No , where is he ? " " Jude 's been running him all over the farm . " She laughed ruefully , adding , " You 'd think Father was interested in buying it , the way he 's looked at it . " Gilbert came to stand before the fireplace , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wry light in his eyes and he said , " Matthew would n't be interested in this farm  --  maybe in the man who owns it ? " Rachel flushed slightly , then said , " Mother , will you help me set the food out ? They went up to see a tract of land that Jude is interested in . Said he wanted to know what Father thought of it . "  |p145By  the time the table was set , the two men walked in . Rachel did not miss the way her father 's face changed at the sight of Lydia and his father . She could not say exactly what it was , but there was a certain sadness in his face that she had gradually come to notice . It was not gloom or despair , and few would even discern it , but now as she watched him enter , she saw his whole expression subtly alter . As his eyes fell on Lydia , she saw a longing in his face and a soft smile on his lips . He still loves her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jude 's face was flushed from the long walk , and he spoke briskly , saying , " Look at that food ! " He moved to the table , shook his head and said , " I have n't had a home-cooked meal like this since the last time you were here . " " Hello , Matthew , " Gilbert said , coming to take his hand . " You 've been away for a long time . " " Yes , " Lydia said quickly , coming to stand beside Gilbert . " We expected you back before this . " " I 've been on some pretty far trails since I was in Plymouth . " He hesitated , then added , " You 're both looking well . " Rachel interrupted , " We can talk while we eat  --  everything 's getting cold . " They all sat down and spent the most relaxed time any of them had had since Matthew 's return . Time had blunted the initial shock , so they were not constantly ill at ease just being with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it necessary to speak of ordinary things in a normal fashion . Jude kept the conversation going , and as the two women kept the food coming and the cups filled , he told Gilbert how he 'd been increasing his holdings . " Land will never be so cheap as it is now , Rev. Winslow ! " he exclaimed . " Now 's the time to buy up every inch of ground you can , because this country will be worth a great deal of money in the years to come . " The rest of them listened , saying little , and finally the meal ended . As the women cleaned the table and put the dishes away , the men sat around talking idly of local matters . Rachel came and sat off to one side , joined by her mother . Gilbert had been telling of the church close by . Then he turned to Matthew . " Deacon Lattimore tells me you 've been quite an encouragement to him , son . "  | " Why , I 've done little enough , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father smiled . " He thinks you 're quite a Bible scholar . Told us over and over how much he 's appreciated your visits . And I did n't know how much you 'd done to help with the Indian mission schools . " " Oh , John is responsible for most of that . I 've just been able to help a bit with the cost . " Gilbert saw that his son was embarrassed , so he merely smiled and said , " God will bless your work , I 'm sure . " At last Matthew went to sleep in the barn , and Gilbert and Lydia retired . Jude and Rachel sat before the fire talking for a while . Jude had been put in a mellow mood by the quiet evening , and he talked of things he hoped to do  --  not business matters , but of things he 'd never shared with her . His face grew dreamy , more relaxed than she 'd ever seen him , and he moved his hands expansively as he spoke of travel , of going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time she sat there , her feet curled under her , her head resting on her palms as she listened intently . Several times he said we when speaking of journeys and plans , and she smiled quietly , thinking of how carefully he 'd avoided any direct talk such as that for a long time . He got up to poke up the fire , then came to sit beside her ; she said in a whisper , " I love it when you talk like that , Jude ! " She made a lovely picture as she sat there , the golden firelightcatching fire in her eyes , her lips slightly parted . His blood was stirred , and he lowered his head and kissed her , then put his arms around her , holding her close . She allowed this , even went so far as to put her hand on his neck , her heart beating faster . Then just as she was drawing back from the increasing pressure of his lips , whispering , " Jude , we must n't  --  " the front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alden  --  there 's some kind of  --  " Jude and Rachel pulled away so rapidly that she nearly fell off the bench . Her hair fell in disarray and there was a look of guilt in the way they came to their feet , staring at Matthew who stopped suddenly , the words broken off abruptly . He stared at them , and for the first time in her life , Rachel saw the Winslow anger she 'd heard about since she was a child.  |p147Her  father 's light eyes blazed like blue fire , and he actually took a step forward so suddenly that Jude stepped backward and raised his hands ! " Do n't ! " Rachel cried , taking a step forward , and it was well she did , for it brought her father 's eyes to her , and she saw his wrath turn to sorrow as he looked at her . Then he pulled himself together and said , " There 's some sort of animal after the stock , Alden  --  a bear , I think . " Jude , welcoming the break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the wall , crying , " I 'll take care of him . " He left the room at a dead run , and Matthew turned without a word to leave , but Rachel said sharply , " Wait ! " " Yes , Rachel ? " She was suddenly angry through and through , and she didnot realize it was at herself instead of her father . She threw herhead back and it was his turn to see some of the Winslow wrath , i this time in the French blackness of his daughter 's eyes ! " I resent what you think ! " she said in a tense voice that quivered with rage . " I  --  said nothing , " Matthew answered . He stood there , a tall shape in the flickering light of the candle , the sharp planes of his face bolder in relief . She struck out at him ; it was not the embarrassment of the moment that drove her to a rage , but the buried resentment and anger at what she had felt from the moment of his return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire that blazed out at Matthew as she stood there . " You 're so holy , are n't you ? " she cried . " The father looking so offended that his precious daughter is kissing a man ! " Tears then flooded her eyes , and she dashed them away angrily , saying bitterly , " Well , what gives you the right to think anything ? Where were you when I was growing up  --  when all the other children had fathers  --  and I  --  did n't ! " Her voice began to break as sobs rose to her lips , and she took two steps that brought her up to him , staring up into his face with an anger she had never shown to a living soul . " Why did you have to come back ? " she cried . Then she raised her hand and struck him in the face twice , each time crying out as if he had struck her ! He stood there , the burning imprint of her hand on hisp148cheeks . His eyes held no anger  --  only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run on , so that the sound of a log breaking in the fire sounded very loud . Then he said so quietly that she almost missed it for her sobbing . " I ca n't blame you for feeling that way , Rachel , " he said . He hesitated , then added , " I never should have come to this place . " She turned blindly and ran to her room , not hearing the door close . For a long time she cried bitterly , until there was nothing in her but emptiness . Finally she got up and undressed and went to bed . As she pulled the covers over her , she thought of the sadness in his face  --  that face so much like Gilbert 's from whom she 'd never had an unkind word , and her throat ached with the pain of it all . Tomorrow ! Tomorrow I 'll make it right with him , she thought . All night she lay there , longing for the dawn . But he was gone , and Jude , not meeting her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited until she had a chance to speak with Lydia alone , and when she had told the whole story , her eyes filling with tears , Lydia took her in her arms . " You 'll have a chance to tell him you were wrong . " She hesitated , then added , " I have to tell him some things , too  --  many things . " Rachel and Lydia waited anxiously for Matthew to make one of his rare visits , but he did not come back to Plymouth . Two weeks passed , and the winter scored the land , closing the trails to travel . They did not speak of him , but he was not far from their thoughts . Lydia vacillated between a longing to recapture those lost years and feelings of bitterness that would spring up , locking her in a vise of unforgiveness . The weeks ran on into February . Then the settlement was shaken with a violence such as it had not known in years . Rachel and Gilbert were on their way to take food to a widow with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the cannon on the square when they saw a crowd milling around near the Common House , making so much noise that Gilbert said , " Must be trouble . " He led her in that direction , and they were met by Jake Mason , whose face was blazing with anger , red despite the freez/ing wind . " They killed ' im , they did ! " " Killed who , Mason ? " Gilbert demanded quickly . " Why , that young Indian  --  " Mason stopped at once , cast a quick look at Rachel , and said in embarrassment , " It 's bad news fer you , Miss Rachel ! " " For me ? " Rachel thought with a blinding stab of fear that it might be her father . " It 's the young Indian lad , you know ? John Sassamon . Murdered , he is ! " Rachel gave a sharp cry and followed Gilbert , who pushed his way through the crowd until they came to stand before a sled drawn by two large horses . The driver was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deacon of the church at Lenton , one of the magistrates of the town . He said at once , " We have much trouble , Pastor Winslow ! " " What happened , Mr. Holt ? " Gilbert asked . " Why , one of our young men found the body of Sassamon nigh onto a week ago . John Wingfield found him , and it was strange ! John and two others was passing by a frozen pond near Middleborough and they noticed something out on the surface of the pond . It looked like a man 's hat , and they found a musket close by . Well , a man 's not likely to leave them things in the dead of winter , so John took another look . And then he saw it ! " Holt shivered a little , and went on , his words being devoured by the crowd . " Right there under the ice was a face ! They ran to get an ax , and they chopped the body out , and it was John Sassamon ! " Gilbert felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one arm , asking , " He drowned , then , and the pond froze over him ? " " Well , so we thought , but Sassamon was an Indian . He would n't have been fool enough to cross the ice before it was hard . We took a look and seen a swelling on the side of his head , which could have come from a blow  --  but then we found out his neck was broken ! Now a man falling into a pond , he 's not likely to do that , is he now , Pastor ? " " Not likely . " " No , indeed ! " Holt said vigorously . " We began to think the lad had been murdered , and it made to look like an accident . "  | " No way to prove that , is there , Mr. Holt ? " The magistrate had the audience in his hand , and he savored the moment . " Not for most , I 'm thinking . Be sure your sin will find you out . ' " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? You did discover something ? " Gilbert asked . " Yes , Reverend , we did  --  and it was like this : An Indian who 'd been on the outs with King Philip seen the whole thing ! And he come to me and when he told his story , we arrested three men for the murder . And we had a trial  --  well , we had two trials , as a matter of fact , to be sure . One was made up of settlers and the other of Indians as can be trusted . " " What was your finding ? " " Guilty as charged  --  and sentenced to be hung , all three of them ! " Holt stared at the crowd and said solemnly , " And hear this , if you please  --  Philip was in a rage , and all three of the men denied it . They stood on the gallows and swore they was innocent . " Holt again paused , and despite the cold , his brow was beaded with sweat , and he pulled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand before he went on . " We hung two of them , but the rope broke under the last one , and he came to himself ! He confessed that all three of them had done the deed , and he swore Philip put ' em all up to it ! Well , we hung him again and the rope did n't break that time ! " A babble of questions rose up , but Gilbert 's voice rang strong and clear . " What about Philip ? " Holt stared at him , licked his lips , then shook his head . " That 's what I 've come to tell you , " he said . " Philip is on the warpath , and we got to organize  --  because when that red devil breaks loose , there 's not a man , woman , or helpless child in this part of the world who 's got a chance to live ! "  |p151S|pring  melted the icy covering of the land early , freeing the rivers by early March . It was one of the fairest springs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The memory of her last words to her father came to her day and night : Why did you come back ? She avoided his presence whenever possible . Lydia observed Rachel 's reaction . In turn she saw what Rachel 's rejection was doing to Matthew . It made her ashamed of her own resistance to him , suppressing the happy memories of their life together , but she could not seem to break out of her resentment . As long as she had thought him dead , she could manage to forgive him . But he was alive ! And no matter what changes had come about in his life , she could not get past her own deep bitterness . She longed to speak to her strong-willed daughter , but could not find a way . How could she help Rachel forgive when she herself could not ? June came , and Rachel grew restless . She walked the shores of the sea and followed the nearby paths through the woods , and she threw herself into the work of the church with an energy that both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of a trip to Swansea , a village only a few miles from Jude 's farm . Mercy and Praise God Pittman had moved from Plymouth in the fall , and the stocky young husband dropped by unexpectedly to ask a favor.  | " It 's time for the baby  --  and Mercy is asking for you to come and be with her , " he said to Rachel . " ' Course there 's some older married women there  --  but she 's partial to you , Miss Rachel . " Rachel said instantly , " Of course , I 'll come . " " But there 's talk about the Indians , Praise God , " Lydia said . " Why do n't you bring Mercy here to have her baby ? " " I tried , but she says she wants me around . I told her I 'd beat her into submission , " he joked , grinning , broadly , " but she knows she 's safe enough ' till the little ' un comes ! " Lydia resisted the idea , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raids , but Rachel got around her by getting Gilbert to agree . She had always been able to sway him , and when she put the request in the form of an opportunity to perform a Christian charity , he could hardly refuse . " You 're a fool where that girl is concerned , Gilbert ! " Lydia said angrily . " War could break out at any time , and you know it ! " Gilbert felt the rebuke keenly , but he had given his word , so when he and Lydia said goodbye to Rachel as she left with Praise God , he could only make one last plea . " Wait until next week , Rachel , and I 'll go with you myself . " She laughed and kissed him , her eyes bright with excitement . " Where 's your faith , Reverend Winslow ? God 's still in control , is n't He ? " She ran to Lydia , gave her a tremendous hug , whispering , " Do n't you worry now , Mother . Who knows , maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She left with Pittman , and when they were out of sight , Lydia stood there staring , her dark eyes filled with apprehension . " She 's been very unhappy lately , Gilbert . " " And so have you , Lydia , " he answered , looking intently down into her face . He made a restless movement with his shoulders , then said tightly , " The Lord has been very quiet to me lately  --  and after all these years of sweet harmony with Him , that 's very painful . I  --  I feel rebuked by the way I 've treated Matthew , Lydia . I had a dream about it last week . " " A dream ? " " Yes , I dreamed I was going into a beautiful house , and somehow I knew it was the house of God . I went through a door and there was a beautiful light , so powerful I could n't bear top153look at it , but I yearned to go closer , for I knew it was my Beloved ! So I tried to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it said , ' You are my son , but I will not accept you until you have been made pure ! ' " Gilbert stared at her , and there was such pain in his honest eyes that she wanted to weep . Then he added , " It does n't take a Daniel to give the interpretation , Lydia . I 've been saying that to my own son ever since he came back . " " You have n't been unkind , Gilbert  --  " " Not unkind ! " he cried out . " God in heaven ! Not unkind  --  is that all I can be to my son who comes back from the dead ? What if the father in the story of the Prodigal had been only that  --  not unkind ! Lydia , I should have brought forth the best robe and put a ring on his finger ! I should have shouted from the rooftop , Thismy son was dead , and is alive again  --  he was lost , and is found ! " Gilbert 's eyes were blinded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulders shaking with grief . Lydia was overwhelmed , and she sought the quiet of her bedroom , fell on her knees , and prayed as she had never prayed before . All day she stayed there , unconscious of the passage of time . The sun reached its zenith , then began its fall ; and still she called out to God . Sometimes her cries were out of the Bible , " Help , Lord , for thy servant perisheth ! " Her grief often struck her dumb and she simply lay on her face saying nothing ; then a prayer would rise up in her very innermost being , as she called out , the absolute certainty that she was in the presence of God flooded her spirit . Darkness came , and still she prayed . On into the night as the stars came out to make icy dots of light on a velvety sky , she waited for something . She seemed to be tied to the diurnal movement of the earth itself , and as the night covered the earth , so her spirit seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her child was born , the pain and grief , and all night long she struggled to give birth to something in her spirit . By dawn her strength was gone . She lay spent and drained on the floor , her hair wet with perspiration and her limbs trembling with weakness . She could not cry any longer , and as the ebony sky outside blushed into pale crimson , the room suddenly seemed to catch some of that light . Lydia did not lift her head , but she felt her heart strangely warmed , and her spirit became calm.  |p154She  felt as the disciples must have felt as the stormy , raging seas that filled their ears with blasts of sound suddenly fell silent and only a hush remained . For a long time she lay there , drinking in the silence , knowing that she was in the presence of the Lord God of all the earth . Then a message came , beginning as a whisper far away , but swelling louder until it filled her heart : Rise up , my love , my fair one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is past , the rain is over and gone ; the flowers appearon the earth ; the time of the singing of birds is come , and the voice of the turtle is heard again in our land . Never did Lydia forget that voice , nor did she forget the commandment that followed , for after the words of Solomon 's Song echoed sweetly in her heart , there followed a time which she knew she could never speak of on earth . Some things are too sacred for words . When she finally rose from the floor , her limbs were cramped with pain , but her heart was filled with a peace such as she had not known existed . All week long she walked with God , shut in with a holy presence , and the light on her face told Gilbert that she had passed out of her crucible . He was made sure of this when on Wednesday of the following week , he came home late in the afternoon to say , " Matthewcame in today with a load of beaver pelts . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said quietly , " Gilbert , I want you to go to Matthew . Tell him I want to see him . " He stared at her , caught off guard by her sudden announcement . " You mean -- now ? " " Yes . " He slowly got to his feet , a question in his eyes , but he said nothing . He had learned over the years that when his dark-eyed daughter-in-law made up her mind , there was nothing to do but stand aside . " I 'll go at once , Lydia , " he said , and left at a fast gait . She sat there holding the cloth for a while , her eyes fixed on nothing . Then she took a deep breath and said , " Amen . " Thirty minutes later she heard his footsteps on the walk.  |p155Her  heart quickened and she stood up . Then he was at the door knocking . " Come in , Matthew , " she said quietly , trying to suppress her emotions . He opened the door to see her standing beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him powerfully . He stepped inside , closing the door , then stood there waiting for her word . " You wanted to see me , Lydia ? " Her oval face was framed by a halo of dark curls , and the smooth planes of her features made her dark eyes seem enormous . Her full red lips trembled slightly , then she nodded . " Matthew , I want to ask you  --  to forgive me . " He stared at her , noting that she was trying to maintain her composure . " Why , Lydia , I do n't think  --  " " Please  --  " she whispered softly , " do n't say anything ! Ever since you came back , I 've been  --  terrible ! " Tears welled up in her eyes and she let them run down her cheeks unheeded . " I 've been so filled up with bitterness and hurt pride that God has had to break me ! And it 's not only that I 've been unjust , but I 've made Rachel feel the same  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood there quietly enough , but his emotions were chaotic . He shook his head , and wonder touched his eyes as he said , " Lydia , you have nothing to reproach yourself for . " " But I do ! " she cried out , and she raised her hands and came to him so suddenly that he caught her in his strong arms . She looked up into his face , and slowly she said , " I am your wife , Matthew  --  if you want me ! " A great roaring seemed to fill his head , stirring memories he thought had died long ago . She put her hands on his neck , and as she drew his head down , she suddenly cried out , " I love you , Matthew ! " He kissed her gently at first ; then exulting in her courageous offer of herself , he finally lifted his head and whispered huskily , " I 've never stopped loving you  --  Princess ! " The use of the old name ran through Lydia , and she laughed softly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said with a smile . " I 've lived on those scraps of memories from our love . "  |p156She  pulled closer to him , and pressing her face against his chest , she said , " No more ! Thank God , we can start over  --  and we 'll make better memories than any you 've ever dreamed , Hus band ! " Gilbert had waited at the inn for Matthew to come back , but when nine o'clock came , he gave an odd smile and glanced toward the hill where his house stood . Getting to his feet , he said to the innkeeper , " Brother Tillotson , I have a strong impression that my son will not be using his room tonight , so I believe I 'll use his bed . " He started up the stairs , then paused and called back with a gleeful note in his voice , " I do n't think my son will be requiring the use of this room anymore . I believe he 's found more suitable accommodations ! "  |p157For  two days after Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving all her time to Mercy , who was having a difficult time of it . The baby was not due for three months , but as healthy as Mercy had been , she was so ill she could eat little and had grown so weak that Rachel had to attend to her constantly . Praise God left to go back to Plymouth for a load of tools , and Jude came the next day . He found Rachel churning butter , and came to her at once . " Jude , I was hoping you 'd come ! " she said , and rose to greet him . He embraced her and gave her a quick kiss . Then she pushed him away with a smile , saying , " That will have to wait . How long can you stay ? " " Just until tomorrow , " he said , and then a worried look crossed his face . " You should n't be here , Rachel  --  and neither should Mercy . The savages around here are stirring up trouble , and when it comes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or child . " She laughed and squeezed his arm playfully , " Oh , you 're getting to be a regular prophet of doom ! Besides , all Indians are n't ' savages , ' as you call them . Sit down and tell me what you 've been doing . " They had a pleasant day together , and that night they satp158up long after Mercy went to bed , talking and laughing . He finally got up , and as she walked with him to the door , he suddenly stopped , turned and said earnestly , " I want to marry you , Rachel . " She stopped , taken aback by the suddenness of it . For one moment she stood there , then she said quietly , " All right , Jude . " He took her in his arms , kissed her more gently than ever , and said , " I love you very much , Rachel ! Very much ! " Then he released her and walked out of the room quickly , as if he did not trust himself . Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different life would be shortly , then she went to bed and slept a dreamless sleep . The next morning she arose and was fixing some gruel for Mercy when she heard the first cries . Puzzled by the voices , she put the skillet down and started for the door . When she opened it she saw a wagon loaded with women and small children careenwildly around the big oak tree in the yard . A bearded man leaped from the driver 's seat , and seeing Rachel , yelled at her , " Get these women into the house ! " " Indians are coming ! " a young woman carrying a baby answered , looking over her shoulder . " They 're killing everything in their path ! " Rachel 's heart turned to ice , and she deposited the child in the house . Running back to get another , she saw Jude running from the barn with his musket . " Is it Indians , Isaac ? " he yelled . " They 'll be here in thirty minutes , Jude , " the man answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hendersons and the Potters and God knows how many more ! My boys is coming  --  there they are now  --  but we 'll be hard put to it , Jude ! " " We 'll have to fort up in the house , " Jude nodded . He turned and saw Rachel , then came to her . His face was pale and set as he said , " Do what you can to help the women and chil-dren ! " " I can shoot , Jude ! " Rachel cried . " Grandfather taught me that . " " Good , " the older man nodded . " We 'll need everyone who can fire a gun . I got a load of ammunition and some extra musketsin the wagon ! " Two boys aged about fifteen came running up , completelyp159winded , and their father , whose name was Trowbridge , said , " John , I want you and Luke to load every musket we got . Come on , now , we got precious little time ! " They all began hauling the muskets and ammunition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jude and Trowbridge organized their little force as well as they could . There were four women , all of whom could load a musket , each situated so the shooters could reach the freshly loaded firearms easily . " They 'll be here soon , " Trowbridge said . He looked around at his wife and children , then said , " Let us give ourselves into the hands of God . " They all bowed their heads and he prayed a short prayer , then said urgently , " Me and my boys will take the downstairs , Jude . You two take the upstairs . You ought to be able to keep ' em off up there , but they 'll be trying to pot you first . " " Come on , Rachel ! " Jude said , climbing up the ladder leadingto the loft , when he placed her at one of the small windows . " They 'll have to cross that clearing to get to the house , and we can stop that  --  at least until it 's dark . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked quietly . He came to her , put his arm around her and they stood there in the quiet . " I do n't know , Rachel , " he said softly . " I been told all my life that God is able to do anything . Maybe He can get us out of this but I have to tell you , it 's a mighty small chance . " " I thought so . " " I  --  I 'm glad I asked you to marry me last night , Rachel , " he said . " You know what I thought about all night ? " " What , Jude ? " " I thought , That Rachel  --  she 'll make a better man out of me ! " He kissed her quickly , and she said , " I hope we have a life together , but if we do n't  --  at least we found each other . " Just then a shot rang out ; he wheeled and , picking up his musket , laid it on the sill and aimed carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't do us any harm ! " Rachel picked up a musket and laid it carefully on the sill . Her heart was pounding , and she wondered if she could send a man to death . Just then she saw an Indian painted in various hues running for the house , a rifle in one hand and a hatchet in the other . At his belt were several bloody scalps , and withoutp160hesitation she drew a bead on his chest and felled him with one carefully placed shot . Before she had a chance to feel sick , another Indian approachedfrom the far side , and she snatched up another loaded musket and hurried her shot . His leg was knocked from under him as he fell , badly wounded . A loud volley of shots erupted from the first floor , and both Rachel and Jude emptied their muskets , then loaded them quickly as the Indians withdrew . But they were not gone , and their hideous screams of rage cut through the morning air . For over an hour there was no sign of an attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , sounding like gravel as it struck . Every pane of glass was shattered ; a sliver of it sliced Rachel 's cheek , but she was unaware of it until she felt the blood running down her face , and even then had no time to do more than wipe it with her sleeve . As the shots continued to rake the house , driving them away from the windows , there was another rush , and this time three of the Indians managed to reach the house . They threw their weight against the stout oak door ; when it refused to budge they moved to try the windows , but were cut down at once by Trowbridgeand his sons . Again there was a lull . Rachel eased her head around the facing of the window . From a shelter of gum trees , a blazing arrow flew in an arc and fell to the ground a few feet from the house . " Get ready to run for it ! They 'll get the roof sure ! " Jude shouted . He was right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturb their aim , an arrow sailed high , and landed with a thud in the roof . The dry thatch caught at once , and within minutes Rachel and Jude were forced to climb down the ladder , blinded by the thick smoke . " We 'll have to take the fight outside , Jude ! " Trowbridge shouted over the roar of the blaze . " We 'll burn to death in this cabin ! " Suddenly the roof began to collapse , and wisps of blazing thatch fell past them to the floor . " I 'll go first and you come after me , Jude ! "  |p161Trowbridge  threw the door open and started to run out , but an arrow hit him in the chest . He dropped his musket to pull at the shaft , but another caught him in the throat and he fell to the floor lifeless . " Everybody out ! " Jude shouted , and they all made a rush at the door . Rachel ran to Mercy who was struggling to get to her feet , and by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the butchery was in full sway . One burly Indian had seized John Trowbridge with one hand and even as Rachel watched , he drew his war club up and killed the boy with one blow to the head . The other boy was trying to protect his mother from two warriors who were pulling at her , and one of them slashed him across the throat with a long knife , leaving him dead . The other Indian then turned to the woman who was on her knees clutching a small baby to her breast . She turned her face up , and cried out , " Please  --  do n't kill my baby ! " But the Indian gave a howl and killed them both . Screams of agony and fear scored the air . Suddenly a shout louder than the rest rang out : " Rachel ! Look out ! " Rachel whirled to see a tall , muscular Indian with red paint smeared all over his body running for her , a hatchet raised high . Jude came through the surging bodies to her right , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He swerved to meet Jude 's charge , making a wild sweeping blow with his hatchet . Jude parried it on the barrel of his musket , then swung the heavy butt around , catching the Indian with a blow that crushed his skull . " Rachel ! " Jude yelled and turned to her ; even as he turned , a bulky form on his left appeared  --  a short Indian with a heavy war club raised high . Jude caught a glimpse of him , but he was too late . The heavy head of the club struck him in the temple , and he dropped to the earth dead . As the short Indian swung around and raised his club to strike Mercy , Rachel instinctively did what she would never have dreamed of . She leaped in front of the woman who had fallen to the ground and faced the savage without a sign of fear . " In the name of Jesus Christ ! " she cried out in a voice that carried like a trumpet over the bloody yard , " I command you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking around to see who was calling out . They saw a young white woman standing over her friend . The most fierce warrior of their tribe held a club over her  --  and she was not afraid . But it was more than that . She had called on the name of her God , and although none of them were Christians , they were superstitious , and there was magic in what they were seeing . The short brave who had killed Jude was called Fox . He was not only the most valiant warrior among them , he was also as shrewd as his name suggested . He stood there , aware that the others were watching , and his Indian sense of drama overtook him . He gave a scream and raised his club , whirling it over his head and giving every impression of a man intent on killing . But the white girl did not move  --  did not even blink . She said again more quietly this time , " In the name of Jesus , I command you to leave us alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stood there staring at the girl . He was not as impressed with her God as he was with her courage . He had a contempt for most Christians , having seen enough greed in some of them to convince him that their religion was a sham . But one or two had been different , and he was curious . The blood lust had died down , and he suddenly said in broken English , " We take this one . " A heavy-set Indian leaped forward to grab her arm , but Rachel drew back and knelt beside Mercy . She looked straight at Fox and said , " You are a woman if you hurt this mother ! " The word she used was one that John Sassamon had taught her when they were children . It meant a womanish man , one who would rather be with squaws than with warriors , and it was a deadly insult . " If you ever want to rile an Indian , " John had said , " just call him that ! " She had heard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now she saw it . Something about the young girl telling Fox he was womanish tickled their fancy . They began to laugh wildly , like small boys , and it was a sight that Rachel would carry to her grave  --  those brutal killers smeared with the gore of children and women slapping their hands on their sides and screaming with laughter , taking up the word that she had used on Fox.  |p163Fox  himself would have killed a man instantly for such an insult , but the very weakness of Rachel , and the absolute fearlessnessof her demeanor somehow cooled his blood ; it was the kind of joke an Indian could understand . He said something she did n't understand , and two Indians , still laughing , came forward . They are going to kill both of us , she thought , but they did not . They helped Mercy to her feet , and then marched both women toward their camp , being especially careful with the pregnant woman . Fox came back to the rear of the war party and walked along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity . Finally he said , " You not afraid to die ? " " No . " For the first time in her life , Rachel realized it was true . Something had happened back there when she had called upon the name of Christ . Suddenly she was aware of a presence with her  --  perhaps the presence her mother had so often spoken of , the peace that settled on her when she prayed . Rachel had scarcely had time to pray , but she knew  --  amazingly  --  that she was not afraid . " Fox not afraid either . " He looked back toward the light from the burning house . " The man I kill  --  your man ? " She almost broke down then , thinking of Jude 's broken body lying on the ground , but drew herself up straight and said calmly , " He was going to be . " Then she looked at Fox and said , " Now he is with Jesus Christ . " He met her gaze for a moment , then said , " Your God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She replied at once , " He saved me , Fox . " He nodded , admiration lighting his black eyes . But he said only , " Yes  --  for now His medicine is strong for you . We will see . " He looked ahead , saying , " We camp here . You take care of woman . " Mercy was almost unconscious , but she was alive . Rachel washed her face with water from the river , and later they ate some of the half-raw meat that one of the Indians did n't want . He tossed it to Rachel as he would have to a dog . Her pride rose up , but she instantly thought , Do what you have to do to keep Mercy and yourself alive ! She almost forced the meat down Mercy 's throat , saying , " Eat ! It may be the last for a long time . "  |p164They  slept a few hours , then Fox prodded Rachel with his foot , saying with a gleam in his beady eyes , " Up  --  see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken up her name " Woman " to jibe at her insult . " What is your name ? " She stared at him . " Nahteeah . " He blinked and said , " Who calls you that ? " " My brother  --  john Sassamon . " He looked at her in a different way , and she had no way of knowing that Fox had hated Sassmon for leaving the old ways for the white man 's God , but he had come to admire him for his honesty and willingness to suffer for what he believed . " We go now , " Fox said , but he made the pace easier so that the pregnant woman would not die . In the days that followed , he came often to speak with the two women , and his influence kept them alive . They arrived the next day at a larger camp , and for several days they rested . Rachel had been afraid that the shock would kill Mercy , but miraculously she seemed to thrive on the scanty diet and the hard conditions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day she would say , " Praise God will find us , Rachel  --  do n't fear ! " Rachel was not at all certain , for the Indians were on the move constantly . Philip was in the camp from time to time , and there were long war talks ; then he would ride off again . Soon after , the band would move and raid another group of settlers or a small village , then move as far away from the scene of the raid as possible . Often Fox would come and sit with Rachel , and in some strange way the two grew into a strange intimacy . He often arguedwith her about religion , telling her that Jesus was too weak , but she never let him see a doubt . " Jesus has me here for a purpose , Fox , " she would say . Once she added to this , " Maybe to show you the way to the true God . " He rocked back and forth with silent glee , finally saying , " You want me to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man  --  Jesus men weak . " She never lost her temper , and he was impressed at the way she accepted the frightful hardships of camp life without a word of complaint . He also was waiting for her to beg for release , but she never said a word.  |p165She  worked hard all day , doing her share of the work , and the Indian women , who had been cruel at first , came to marvel at her patience . At first she could do nothing that they did with ease , but by the end of two weeks , she could keep a pace nearly equal with theirs , and they let her alone . At night she prayed  --  she and Mercy together ; then for long nights she prayed as sleep came and enveloped her . She had dreams of Jude for a while , but she was far too weary to grieve . She lost track of time , knowing it had been weeks after Jude 's death . Then one day Fox came to see her with some news . " We leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for her to ask where they would go , but she said nothing . " Maybe you think white men come  --  take you home ? No , we go far away  --  to Nipmuck people , very far away . " He waited for her to speak , then grew angry . " You die with us ! Never go home ! " She stared at him and said evenly , " Fox , my God has a million angels in His tribe . He could send one of them , and you would be helpless against him . " Fox reached out and grabbed her long hair , the first time he had touched her , and said angrily , " No one Jesus man can kill Fox ! " He let her go then , and shook his head . " We leave soon . " For the first time , Rachel 's faith wavered , and she wept in the darkness . And for the first time as she prayed , there seemed to be no answer . As she rose the next morning and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face , and he smiled and said , " Now you see that Jesus God is weak ! "  |p166News  of Philip 's raid swept through the country . They heard almost daily of new massacres after Swansea  --  Dartmough , Taunton , Middleborough and Sudbury . Fifty men were massacredin Lancaster , and forty homes were put to the torch in Groton . The Indians were set to move with Philip as their head , and New England was totally unprepared  --  strategically , mentally , and spiritually . A company of ill-trained militia would blunder out to be cut to pieces by an Indian ambush , and no one knew what to do . When the news of the raid of Swansea came , Matthew and Gilbert were stunned . Praise God came riding in wildly , trying to raise a party to go to the rescue . " They got my Mercy  --  and your girl , Master Winslow , " he moaned bitterly . " God forgive me for leavin ' her ! " " Are you sure they 're alive , Pittman ? " Matthew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we followed their heathenish trail , " he nodded . " They left the horse alive , at least , and I 'm goin ' to git my woman back if I have to go alone ! " " I 'll be with you in an hour , Praise God , " Matthew said . " We have to go tell Rachel 's mother ; then we 'll be leaving . " As they hurried to the house , Gilbert said , " We 'll have to raise a militia , Matthew . "  |p167He  said nothing , but when they went inside the house he went to Lydia and took her in his arms . " The Indians have raided Swansea  --  and Rachel and Mercy are captives . " He looked into her eyes and said , " I 'll bring them back , Lydia . Do you believe that ? " The shock weakened her , but she looked up into his strong face , trembling and whispered finally , " If you say so , Matthew . I 'll wait for you . " There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dressed in old leather clothing used on the trail , Gilbert argued with him . " You ca n't go alone , son . Let me go to the governor . He 'll have to act now ! " Matthew picked up a bedroll and started for the door , then turned and looked at Gilbert . They were so much alike , yet now there was a hardness in his son that the old man had never seen . Always he had been the strength of the family , and now he saw that his time was past . " What can you do , Matthew ? " The blue eyes glowed with the light of battle , and Matthew said , " Militia will never catch up with Philip 's band or any other Indians . But there 's one bunch who can catch them ! " Gilbert asked blankly , " Why , who can do that ? " " The Praying Indians ! " Matthew smiled grimly . " I 'll pick up a group of them and we 'll find out where the women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think so . Some of the Praying Indians have family who have n't come over , but they hear things . " Gilbert nodded , then said , " That may find them , but how do you plan to get them out of the camp ? " Matthew dropped his bedroll , walked to the wall and reached up . He pulled down Gilbert 's sword , the one he 'd used to fight Lord Roth and the mutineers who took over the Mayflower . He pulled it out of the sheath , held it up , and looked along the line of light that gleamed on the cold steel . " I 'd like to borrow this , Father , " he said quietly . Gilbert smiled , his eyes burning with a longing to go along . But knowing that he would be far too slow , he said , " Take it , my boy  --  and God go with you . " Matthew suddenly knelt before his father and huskily said , " Give me your blessing , Father ! "  |p168Gilbert  Winslow prayed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and then Matthew rose and was gone . The Praying Indians had learned to trust Matthew , but they were slow to respond to his call . " We are but a few , and Philip has the largest army of Indians ever seen since the beginning , " James Bearclaw said . " God will provide a way , James . He has preserved the lives of the two women , and I know that He will help us . Will you go if I promise there will be no battle  --  not for you ? " After discussion with the others , finally James said , " We will find the women  --  but you must take them yourself . " " A bargain ! " Matthew smiled , and later he told Pittman , " We have a chance , Praise God . " " How we gon na do it , Matthew ? The two of us against all them savages ? " " Not by might , nor by power  --  but by my Spirit ! " Winslow quoted . " Let 's find them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only four days to get wind of the camp . One of James Bearclaw 's relatives , a young man named Rookna , brought word , and James came immediately to Winslow and Pittman . " We know where they are , but the band is moving soon . Rookna says they are going to the Nipmuck band , and you 'll never find them if they get there ! " " Take us to the place ! " Matthew said , and in two hours they were on their way toward the west . They traveled hard all night and at dawn , one of the scouts came back with a word . " They are not two miles away , in a little canyon . Not very many warriors  --  butFox is there . " " Did you see the women ? " Matthew demanded . " Yes . They are there . " Winslow gave some instructions and they moved out silently . Praise God asked nervously , " I do n't think it 's going to work , Matthew . This Fox , he 's not stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's proud , and that 's what we 've got to play on . You just keep your hammer down on that musket . We 'll have to win by something other than muskets if we win this one , Praise God ! "  |p169Rachel  was walking down the path toward the rear of the band when she heard the shout ; she looked up to see Fox and the other warriors spanning out with their weapons drawn . " What is it , Rachel ? " Mercy asked . " I do n't know . Let 's get closer . " They approached the head of the canyon they 'd been walking through , and Fox gave them a savage look and waved them to a halt . He looked up at the sides of the cliff on his right , and then to the left . A thick growth of oak covered the lips of the canyon , and he could see nothing . Then a voice came from somewhere , a ghostly voice that floated on the morning air . Fox  --  you are a Woman ! It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this was no frail girl that called so strongly ! " Come down  --  and you will see what Fox is ! " the stocky Indian shouted . There was no answer for a moment , then suddenly an Indiancalled out something , and Fox whirled to see a man standing on the edge of the canyon wall  --  a white man . Instantly , Fox gave a command and several of his men leaped to go after the intruder , but halted abruptly when a volley rang out , plowing the dust at their feet ! Fox stared at the dust , then raised his eyes to the man on the wall of the canyon . " What you want , white man ? " " I want the two women , Fox ! " Rachel suddenly gasped , and shielding her eyes she stared at the man and breathed a word : " Father ! " Fox whipped his gaze around , then stared back at the man . " I have the women . We will have you , too , white man . " Again a shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's foot , not two inches away . He jerked the foot back involuntarily and then scowled . " That shot could have been in your head , Fox , " Matthew shouted down at the Indian . " I am not afraid to die ! " " I say you are ! " Winslow challenged . " You are a Woman , Fox , and all your men are cowards , able only to fight women and children ! "  |p170A  yell of rage went up , and Fox raised his hand for silence . " We soon see who is coward ! " " I will prove you are a Woman . " Matthew said , " Choose your four best warriors , give them a blade , and I will fight them by myself ! " Instantly a cry went up , and Fox knew he had no choice . He was leader as long as the others knew he was not afraid . If he did not take up this challenge , he would be challenged by every warrior in the band . " Come down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say anything for long . " The silence was broken only by the far-off cry of a bird . Rachel 's pulse quickened , beating like a hammer . Matthew disappeared , then in a moment came walking out of a group of trees a hundred yards down the road . He carried no musket , but there was a sword in his hand that flashed in the sun like silver fire . He wore no hat , his auburn hair catching the sunlight . Every eye was on the tall man as he walked easily along the trail , as blithely as if there were no band of armed savages lined up against him . " Fox , I give you good day , " he said , and then he smiled and nodded at Rachel . " You are all right ? " Rachel caught her breath , answering quietly , " Yes , we have been well treated . " Matthew nodded , then said , " Fox , you have been good to my people , and it hurts me to destroy your warriors . Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was a good try , and Fox smiled briefly . " That not what you say . Are you liar like other white men ? " Winslow suddenly whipped the blade through the air . It made a whistling sound and the suddenness of it startled the Indians . " This is a magic blade , Fox . It was my father 's blade , and he has used it to destroy our enemies . It is not like other blades , and I do not like to see young men die like sheep . But you are the leader . I wait for your men . " He turned , took five steps , then wheeled , with the sword held high over his head . Fox asked , " Who kills this man for our People ? "  |p171Every  single warrior cried out , but Fox was cautious . He saw something in the white man he did not like , and he wanted no mistakes , so he named four names  --  all of them tested warriors , not a beginner in the group . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground except for their knives , then began to advance on Winslow , who did not move except to lower his sword , leveling it at the group . As they approached one of them spoke , and they began to spread out as Matthew had known they would . It was what he himself would have done , had he been one of them . And it was the problem he had pondered night after night , for this plan had been born of desperation  --  the only thing he could think of with even a slight chance of success . He had no plan except to have no plan . The only thing he had in his favor was that these men had never seen a swordsmanI in action . They had no concept of the speed with which he could lower a blade and send it home , faster almost than a striking serpent . But not if they were behind him , and not if they threw their knives . But knife-throwing was not an art that Indians practiced . Now , like wolves , they began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rachel had to choke off . Her father looked so alone out there ! The savages who moved like cats to encircle him were strong , quick and totally devoid of fear , she knew well . How could he hope to win ? And he came for me  --  after all my hatred ! her heart cried out , and she uttered a mighty silent prayer to God for him ! Now was the time , Winslow knew ; the two braves on his flanks were almost out of his line of vision , while the other two before him stood three feet apart , their weapons ready if he turned to face either one . Always do the unexpected ! The words had been spoken years ago by the master who taught him his lessons with the sword . The best swordsman in the world  --  if he gets rattled  --  can be taken ! He did the one thing that could be done . Ignoring the two Indians who were moving to flank him , and paying no heed at all to the man on the left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunged his entire body toward the large Indian on his right !  |p172The  distance was critical , for if his enemy was too far away the sword would never touch him , and he would stand at full stretch , helpless . If the man were too close , the sword might catch in his flesh , and he would be cut to pieces trying to get the blade free . Now the power flowed through his leg , and with the speed of a lifetime of practice the tip of his blade leaped through the air with all the force of his body behind it ! The Indian was leaning forward balanced on the tips of his toes , tilting forward , and he could not believe that the white man was moving at him . Desperatelyhe tried to reverse his feet , but it was too late ! The stroke brought the sword into his body , penetrating the heart  --  then it was withdrawn as Winslow whipped his blade back , stained crimson and shouted , " You see , Fox ! The blade is magic ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stared down at the small puncture on his breast in disbelief . He looked across at Matthew and tried to say something , suddenly dropped to the ground  --  dead . Matthew saw that the savage on his left was paying no heed to him , and he did what he never would have done if the lives of the two women had not been at stake . He shouted and lunged with the same speed . The man had time to get his knife up , but the tip of Matthew 's blade rasped over it , entered the fleshy side of the brave who grabbed his wound and gasped . But he was made of strong stuff , for he threw himself at Winslow , who had no choice but to strike the final blow . But as the second Indian fell , he knew that he had turned his back too long , and even though he made a wild lunge to his left , he felt a line of fire run along his back as a blade ripped through his flesh . A cry of victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he knew that both men would be on him like animals . He had time only to roll over on his back before the sweaty body of one Indian fell on him . By catching the man 's forearm with his left arm , Matthew managed to divert the knife thrust that would have driven straight to his head . The sword was useless at close range , so he dropped it and with a mighty lunge of his body , threw the Indian off , and rolledp173to his feet just in time to see a shape to his left . He had no time at all to think , but simply reached out and grabbed for whatever part of the man he could get . The flesh was slippery but his hands closed on a muscular arm and with all his might he whipped the man around in a giant swinging motion and releasedhim . As the savage went flying through the air , Matthew reached down with one motion and picked up his sword , fell to his left in time to avoid the wicked slash that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove the blade into the body of the Indian who was off balance . As the Indian went down , Matthew whirled to find his last opponent rushing in , blade out before him . But suddenly he stopped short when he realized that his three companions were on the ground , dead or dying. t Winslow could have killed him where he stood , but he lowered his blade , and in the silence that suddenly fell on the scene , he looked at Fox and said , " There is no need for this man to die , Fox . He has proven that he is no coward . " The man cried out and ran toward Matthew 's blade in a suicidal rush , but Fox shouted to him , and he stopped . Fox stood there staring at the tall white man , then looked at the men on the ground . Matthew knew that if this small Indian gave the word , he would die with an arrow in his heart , but he did not move nor speak . The Fox said , " Take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox gave her one look . He moved closer to her and said in a voice only she and Mercy heard . " This Jesus man is strong . Few more like Him  --  maybe Fox become Jesus man , too ! " Then he said , " You go now . " For a long time he stood there watching Matthew and the two women as they faded away into the woods . They did not speak until Praise God and James suddenly appeared , and as Mercy wept in her husband 's arms , Rachel turned to her father . He was smiling at her . Suddenly she threw herself into his arms  --  and it was like coming home ! For a long time they stoodp174there . Finally he kissed her cheek and said , " Your mother has forgiven me and we 're together now . " She smiled through her tears and nodded . " Forgive me , Father , for being so  --  " He put his hand on her lips and said , " I 've found a daughter now  --  and we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cried . Great joy filled her heart as she said , " Oh , Father  --  let 's go to Mother now . " Three days later Lydia heard the sound of steps on the porch . " Mother ! I 'm back ! Father brought me back ! " As Lydia held the girl in her arms , she looked over at her husband and said with a smile , " I knew he would . " Then she held out her free arm and as Matthew came to her , she added with misty eyes , " These Winslow men  --  they do what they say ! "  |p177Miles  Winslow raised himself high in the stirrups and , shadinghis eyes from the brilliance of the midday April sun , stared down the road , then yanked his hat off , exposing a thick shock of yellow hair . " There they are , Howland ! " he yelped , and spurred his startled bay into a hard run toward a small clapboard house . His companion , though , only shook his head and continued the steady pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked with amused tolerance as he watched young Winslow pull his horse down , spring to the ground with the ease of a natural rider , and throw his arms around the pair who stood outside the neat white fence that enclosed the house . Not very dignified for Harvard 's newest scholar , Robert Howland thought . A minister ought to be a little more restrained . Howland was a solidly built man with heavy shoulders and a muscular neck . His square face and strong chin revealed a stubborn streak , which he tried unsuccessfully to curb . His light-gray eyes were wide set deep beneath a broad forehead . His light-brown hair was cut short , and his features were more durable than esthetic . He looked , in fact , more like a strong , active gentleman squire than an intellectual scholar . He came up to the fence , swung easily from his saddle , then waited patiently while young Winslow finished greeting the cou/pie . There was in Howland a strange mixture of deliberate thought and a sort of ponderous behavior , which covered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check . " Come , now , Robert , " young Miles said , turning the attention of the couple toward the visitor . " This is my father and mother  --  and this is my friend and teacher , Rev. Robert How-land . " " It 's a pleasure to welcome you to Salem , sir , " Matthew Winslow said warmly , and the hand he gave in greeting was as hard and strong as Howland 's own . " We 've heard nothing but your name since Miles arrived at Harvard . " Howland took in Winslow 's strong figure with approval . He had heard of Miles ' father by reputation , and the man 's appearancewas impressive . He was six feet tall with the strong , athletic figure of a man in his late forties . He was an older edition of Miles , the resemblance between the two so sharp that it caught Howland off guard . They both had the same sharp features , the light hair with the trace of reddish gold when the sun caught it , as it did now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winslow blood . " I 'm happy to meet you , Mr. Winslow  --  and you , ma'am , " Howland said in a deep , prideful voice that would shake the rafters had he cared to lift it . He nodded to the beautiful woman who looked small in the presence of the three large men . She still appeared too young to be the mother of a sixteen-year-old son . " Come inside , Rev. Howland , " Lydia Winslow said . There was a trace of coquetry in her voice and in her black eyes . Her dark beauty and expressive features still bore evidence of the French blood of her father . They entered the house , and for the next hour sat around the oak table , where Howland discovered the source of his young pupil 's wit and intelligence . He had " discovered " Miles three years earlier when the young man had come to Harvard at the age of thirteen . In their first meeting he had been astoundedat the breadth of Miles ' scholarship and at the same time warmly approving of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years he had nurtured the boy , who had becomep179known at the school as " Howland 's Student , " for the older man had been jealous of the lad , not trusting other instructors to do the finishing he felt necessary . Ordinarily this sort of monopoly would have been forbidden , but Robert Howland himself was on a special footing at Harvard . He was a close friend of Cotton Mather , and such prestigewas enough to permit Howland to do pretty much as he pleased . In all fairness , it was not his friendship with the titular head of the Puritan world , but his own brilliance that had made him a legend at the school . Cotton Mather had graduated from Harvard at the age of fourteen , but he had said often , " I got an early start , and Robert Howland got a late one  --  but if we had begun together , I have no doubt he would have eclipsed my record . " Sitting there at ease as he had rarely been on a first visit , Howland noted that Matthew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were combined in their son . " I 'm surprised you 'd think of leaving your position with Harvard to pastor a small church , Rev. Howland , " Matthew said at last . " It was a difficult decision , " Howland admitted . " But I 've grown too bookish over the last few years . The Lord has instructedme to go out where the harvest is white . Except for the time I 've preached for Rev. Mather , I 've been rather tied to my desk . " " Aye , a man needs to be with the people , " Winslow nodded . " My father says that there are too many people at universitieswho have more degrees than they have temperature ! " " Matthew ! " Lydia said sharply , " you should n't say such things to Reverend Howland . " " Oh , Father can say anything ! " Winslow laughed . " He 's ninety-one , you know , and he never was noted for his tact . " " I 've been anxious to meet him , sir , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than all of Harvard combined . " Matthew threw back his head and reached over to pound his son on the shoulder , " Son ! You 've got no more tact than any other of us bull-headed Winslows ! Imagine telling your teacher a thing like that ! " " It 's good to see a young man who honors his parents , Mr.p180Winslow , " Howland remarked , smiling at the young man . They talked a little longer and then Miles looked out the bay window and jumped to his feet . " There 's Grandfather and Rachel ! " he yelped and dashed out the door . Howland heard him talking excitedly and was amused at how the young man , who had gone to great effort to be dignified at Harvard , had now reverted almost to a wild , puppyish excitement in the presence of his family . As they entered the cabin , Miles said , " This is my grandfather  --  and this is Robert Howland , sir ! " Howland looked at Gilbert Winslow , and was in some awe of the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last living member of the Firstcomers  --  that intrepid band of Pilgrims who had come on the Mayflower so many years ago ! " I 'm honored , Mr. Winslow . I believe you knew my grandfather , John Howland ? " the minister said at once , and the hand that gripped his was still strong and without a tremble despite the years . " John Howland ! " The old man stared at him . " I did , indeed , and a fine man he was , too ! Your servant , sir . My grandson speaks highly of you . " Time had taken a fraction from his height , so that he was slightly beneath his son and grandson , but he still stood straight as a pine sapling . The cornflower blue eyes were undimmed , and the tapering face was browned by the sun . His voice was not strong as it had once been , but there was no tremor as he spoke in a thin , clear tone , and his movement , if not swift as those of his tall descendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to be pastor at Littleton , Father , " Matthew said . " They need a man of God there , " Gilbert snorted . " The last one they had had no more backbone than an oyster ! " He shot a glance at Howland and said , " My grandson tells me you know the Word , sir . I trust you will preach it undiluted  --  put the fire back in hell and the fear of God in those half-baked , lukewarm , imitations of Christians in that church ! " Miles laughed in delight , and gave Howland a sly wink . " Do n't beat around the bush , Grandfather ! Just come right out and say what you think about Brother Howland 's new charge ! "  | " Now you behave yourself , Gilbert Winslow ! " Lydia commanded , giving his arm an affectionate squeeze . " I think ReverendHowland can be trusted to take care of his church without your help . " Gilbert had opened his mouth to continue , but at Lydia 's words he shut it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still trying to make a gentleman out of me , Lydia ? You should know by now how hopeless that is ! " " Reverend , this is my daughter , Rachel , " Matthew said , and Howland , who had looked to one side to speak with Gilbert Winslow , turned to face the woman who had entered and was standing quietly beside her father . " This is Reverend Robert Howland , Rachel  --  the teacher Miles has been talking about for so long . " " Welcome to Salem , Reverend Howland . " " I 'm  --  very happy to meet you , Miss Winslow . " Howland had stammered slightly , for although Miles had talked almost constantly about his older sister , he had never once mentioned the fact that she was a strikingly beautiful woman . Why did n't the young pup tell me she was so lovely ! he thought with some irritation . He was a man who did n't like to be surprised , and it bothered him that he had been struck so forcibly with her beauty that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thirty-three , he was fairly hardened to the good looks of young women . Being one of the most eligible bachelors in the country , he had discovered , brought out the worst in most people . Almost everyone had a sister , a niece , or some girl who would make the perfect wife for him , and he had long ago thrown up a wall of defense against such ploys . But this woman shook that hardness , for she was without a doubt the most attractive woman he had ever seen , he admitted grudgingly . He gave her a hard stare , hoping to find some flaw , but was unable to do so . She was , he knew , thirty years old , but no one with eyes would have taken her for such . Why , she looks no more than twenty ! Howland thought suddenly . He took in the creamy smooth cheeks , like pale ivory , highlighted by a pair of almond-shaped eyes , hazel except for times when there was a greenish glint which gave her a saucy look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the white cap that perched atop her head . The simple gray homespun dress did not conceal the smoothly rounded form , and there was an intensely womanly air about her , despite the direct look and almost militant posture . " You 'll be staying with us tonight , " Miles said slyly . He had not missed the startled look that Howland had given his sister , and it delighted him that the self-assured minister was put off stride for a change . " I do n't want to be troublesome , " Howland replied quickly . " No trouble , sir , " Gilbert Winslow offered , " I want to talk to you about a few matters . " " Look to yourself , Reverend " Lydia laughed . " The Winslowsshow no mercy where theology is concerned . " " And this one is the worst , " Matthew stated , going to Rachel and putting his arm around her . " Got more scripture in her than most of these fools who call themselves ministers have these days , " Gilbert nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " He turned and left , and Rachel said with a smile , " I 'll look forward to seeing you this evening , Reverend Howland . " She followed her grandfather through the door , and the minister saw that they were chattering like two school children as they headed down the street . " I hope you wo n't be offended at my father , sir , " Matthew apologized . " He speaks his mind a little bluntly . " " I 've heard so much about him from Miles that I 'm rather intimidated , " Howland answered . " He 's quite an institution , is n't he ? " " We were n't sure how he would take the move here from Plymouth , " Matthew remarked . " But my business was here in Salem , and Reverend Findley died soon after we moved ; Father practically pastored the church for years  --  with Rachel 's help . " Miles nodded at Howland , adding with a smile , " She 's the best minister in the whole colony , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He shook his head in admiration and warned Howland with a grin , " Do n't get into a theological argumentwith her , I warn you . Aside from yourself , she knows the Scripture better than anybody I know . " " Can preach a better sermon , too ! " Matthew vowed.  | " ' Course she calls it teaching  --  but I tell you , Reverend , when she speaks to a congregation , it 's a thing to hear ! " Howland frowned . " I rejoice that she knows the word , but the Scripture says , ' Let the women keep silence in the church , " you remember . " " I 'm afraid Rachel has too much Winslow in her , " Matthew returned ruefully . He scratched his head , then shrugged his shoulders . " Miles is right , though , and I 'd advise you to steer clear of her . She has a way of being more logical than you 'd think for a woman so attractive . " " That 's what does it , Father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men do n't think she has any intelligence  --  or else they get all nervous because she 's a beautiful woman . Anyway , I 've seen some pretty fair Bible scholars get put flat on their backs  --  theologically speaking , of course !  --  and never knew what hit them ! " " You two hush ! " Lydia interrupted , then continued , more quietly but with force , " Rachel is a handmaiden of the Lord , Reverend Howland . She 'll never marry , so she says , because she can serve God better in the unmarried state , as the Apostle Paul puts it . And you 'll not find a woman in these parts  --  or a man either  --  who serves God so faithfully . " " That 's true , " her husband nodded . " The poor bless her , and her prayers for the sick  --  " He shook his head in wonder and finished , " Well , you 'll admire her , as we all do , but she is a problem for some of our ministers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sister 's good works , and I know you praise God for such a daughter . It will be my pleasure to become better acquainted with her . " Robert Howland got better acquainted with Rachel Winslow that evening , but it did not improve his disposition . The meal had been excellent , and he had enjoyed listening to Gilbert Winslow tell of the voyage on the Mayflower . It was almost as if a witness had stepped forward from the Scripture , for the Firstcomers were , of course , the heroes of the church in America , and to hear the old man say things like : " . . . so Standishsaid to me. . . ! " or " Then I went to Governor Bradford and told him it had to be so ! " These demigods  --  or so they seemedp184to Howland  --  had been Winslow 's friends ; he had known them intimately , and it was a wonder to hear it . Finally Gilbert Winslow said , " It was a grand crew , and I would to God that some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I think we have a goodly number of dedicated Christiansin our own day , " Howland said . " It 's a common mistake to think that people in earlier times were more spiritual than in our own days . " " Do you really think that , Mr. Howland ? " Rachel had said little all evening , but now she faced him directly across the table where they sat drinking tea , her hazel eyes gleaming , with a pronounced tilt to her chin as she shook her head . " You have been leading a sheltered life at Harvard . " Howland flushed , for he was not accustomed to being challenged  --  especiallyby a woman . " I think we are not so bad as many say , Miss Winslow . " " I think we are worse , sir ! " She did not raise her voice , but there was no weakness at all in her tone or her look as she began to speak directly to the tall minister . " Our Fathers gave up everythingthey had in the world , risked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of worshiping God . And what are men risking today ? Nothing ! " " Well , really , Miss Winslow , from a theological point of view , we are not in such bad condition . We have more members in our churches now  --  " " More members , yes ! " Rachel said instantly . " But what of the quality ? You are aware of the Half-Way covenant , I trust ? " " Certainly ! But  --  " " A covenant straight from the pit ! " she said directly , and Howland blinked at her bluntness . The Half-Way Covenant had been approved in 1657 by the Ministerial Convention in an attempt to settle a question that was both theological and social . Only members of the church could vote in the Bay Colony , and when the children of the first settlers grew to maturity , they were thought to be saints because they shared the covenant with their parents . But then their children came along , and most of them had no conversion experience of their own . The church was in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it meant that no man needed to be converted  --  but on the other hand , they could not vote if they were not admitted . A solution had been reached in the Half-Way Covenant , which permitted the children of members to belong to the church without a conversion experience . Howland replied with some fervor , " Certainly , that covenantis not the best answer , and Rev. Mather opposed it , but we must work within the framework of the entire church , Miss Winslow . " " The church , sir , " she debated , " is the bride of Jesus Christ , and no man nor any group can by agreeing together soil her garments ! " " You oversimplify ! " he answered hotly . " Jesus said , ' Ye must be born again . ' Are you going to say that the Savior ' oversimplified ' the conditions for salvation ? " she challenged . " Well  --  of course I 'd not say that  --  " " Then the Half-Way Covenant is wrong ? " Never had Howland felt so ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much by her enormous eyes as by her use of scripture and logic did little to make him feel any better . " I think you would need to do much research and study before you can draw that conclusion , Miss Rachel ! " he said lamely . " The conclusion is simple , sir , " Rachel insisted , ignoring her mother , who was trying to signal for her to stop . " Either men are saved by good intentions and moral living  --  or they are saved by grace through the blood of the Lord Jesus ! " She suddenly reached over and plucked up a Bible , placing it before Howland . " Show it to me in the Word of God , sir , and I 'll believe it ! " " I tell you , ma'am , it 's not so easy as that ! " Howland 's resonantvoice rose , filling the room , and his face was red . Suddenly the tension that had risen so unexpectedly was broken as Gilbert Winslow slapped the table and laughed . " By my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ! He was a dear fellow , John was . I knew him in England , you know , before we came to Plymouth . " Howland stared at him , his quarrel with Rachel forgotten . " I never knew anyone who knew him , sir . " " Well , I did , my boy ! " The old man smiled at the memory.  | " As a matter of fact , you would n't be here right now if it were n't for me . " " Sir ? " " Why , your grandfather went up on deck one night , and somehow managed to fall overboard . He caught a rope , though , and hung on for dear life . I came topside and heard him calling , so I got some help and we hauled him on board . " " I 've not heard of that ! " " Mr. Bradford tells of it in his history , " Gilbert said . " And he was much like yourself  --  in a physical way , though no scholar . A strong man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut us down in that first winter , it was just myself , Miles Standish , John Bradford and your grandfather who were able to stand up . John and I dug many a grave  --  and he never once complained , he did n't ! A good strong man and a faithful companionhe was , " Gilbert said softly , and then wistfully , " And I miss him to this day . " The old man 's words brought a peace to the room , and soon they left , after Howland promised to return the next day to visit with Gilbert . As they were walking back to the house , Miles said slyly , " I told you not to underestimate Rachel . " " I 'll remember that , " Howland said shortly . " She needs a husband with a strong hand , I think . " Miles thought about that . " Well , " he noted , " if there 's any man on this earth any stronger than my sister , I 'd like to meet him . There 's been quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean . But none of them measure up . " Howland did not answer , but he thought wryly , What the woman needs is a good beating . But he realized at the same time that his own admiration for her beauty would make such a thing difficult , so he put the whole matter of Rachel Winslow out of his mind.  | " Robert , all this talk of witches  --  what do you make of it ? " " The devil , sir , is not dead  --  and he will find an entrance if God 's people do not keep the door blocked . " The duties of his church kept Howland close to his village as a rule , but his one recreation in the two months since leaving Harvard had been angling with Gilbert Winslow . The young man had found that being a pastor required a certain amount of practicalexperience that no knowledge of Latin or Greek would solve , and he came at least once a week to fish with the aging man in the stream that wound its way through Salem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little until Winslow broke the silence with his question about witchcraft . He was not , however , satisfied with the answer , for he shook his head and said , " I mislike it , Robert . There 's something about the subject makes people behave stupidly . Why , would you believe that fool Putnam woman has spread the rumor that she lost all her children in childbirth because Rebecca Nurse put a curse on her ? And if there ever was a shrew it 's Ann Putnam , and if there ever was a saint , it 's Rebecca Nurse ! " " Aye , there will always be ignorance , Mr. Winslow , but Rev. Cotton Mather 's book Relating to Witchcraft documents the acts of witches well . It 's all there , the invisible world , all your incubi and succubi  --  all your witches and wizards of night and day.  |p188'Thou  shalt not suffer a witch to live , ' as the Scripture says . " The soft May breeze blew a lock of silver hair across Gilbert 's eyes , and he brushed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's needed is a dose of good old-time religion . That would purge all the silly notions people have of trying to live for God on Sundays and for the devil the other six days . " A laugh broke from Howland 's deep chest , and he pulled his cane pole up and began to wind up the line . " Things are always so simple with you , sir ! No grays  --  just black or white , right or wrong . " " Well , I 'm an old man now , son , " Winslow remarked with a smile as he took his own line in . " When I was your age I was just about like you , running around trying to split hairs on matters . But the closer I get to home , the more I see that living is not very complicated . Jesus said , ' Whosoever cometh not after me and forsaketh all he hath can not be my disciple , ' and that 's fairly simple  --  ' all that he hath . ' " Howland reached down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then as they walked along the side of the bubbling stream , he mused thoughtfully , " But yours was a different world , was n't it ? Things are much more complicated now than when you came to Plymouth . " " Men are born , they love , they die  --  and someplace along the way they either meet Jesus Christ and follow Him , or they do n't . " " You sound like Rachel , " Howland chuckled . " Or I suppose she sounds like you . All you Winslows are pretty much alike , are n't you ? " " A stubborn breed , Robert ! " Gilbert smiled . They made their way back to his house , and Rachel met them at the door , smiling at the pair . " More fish to clean ? " she asked , shaking her head . " Put them in the back and I 'll clean them when I return . I 've got to go over to Elizabeth Crowley 's with some food . " " I 'll clean the fish , " Gilbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go with Rachel , Robert  --  then come back and we 'll have these fellows for supper . " " Why , I 'm not sure ... " " Oh , come along , Reverend , " Rachel urged ; then she gavep189a little giggle , which surprised him . " I promise not to bite your head off or argue about scripture . " Howland had steered clear of Rachel since their disagreementon his first night , but now took the heavy basket of food she handed him , and they made their way through the village , talking about unimportant things . Finally he said , " I 've been wanting to apologize to you , Miss Winslow , for my sharp words . " She turned to look at him and smiled . " I 'm too straightforward , I know that . Forgive me , please . " Then the air was cleared and he told her of his church and the problems until they came to a small unpainted clapboard house on the edge of the village . Four children were playing in the yard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling her name and pulling at her clothing . It made a pretty sight , Howland decided , and he wondered  --  notfor the first time  --  why she had never married . She gave each of the children a piece of honeycomb from the basket , then led him inside . " Elizabeth ? " she announced . A small , worn-looking woman came to the door and paused at seeing the tall form of the minister . " This is Reverend Howland , from Littleton , Elizabeth . ReverendHowland , this is Mrs. Crowley . " " How d' you , sir ? " the woman said in a small voice , then turned to say , " Jamie is took bad , Miss Rachel ! " " Let 's see , " Rachel stated , and the three of them entered the room where a small boy , not more than four or five , was lying on a bed almost hidden by the covers . His face was red , and he was breathing roughly and unevenly . Rachel sat down beside the boy , started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . " Reverend Howland , will you pray for Jamie ? " " Why , surely . " Howland stepped forward and prayed briefly , then stepped back , his duty done . " I trust the Lord will be merciful on your boy , Mrs. Crowley , " he murmured quietly . It always made him feel inadequate , praying for the sick , and he had done little enough of it at Harvard . As the pastor of a flock , it was different , however , and it was one of the things that drove him to talk with Gilbert Winslow.  | " Please , Miss Rachel , " Mrs. Crowley whispered , " wo n't you say a prayer , too ? " " If you like , Elizabeth . " She reached into a pocket and pulled out a small object . Howland leaned over and saw that it was a small vial . Opening it , she put a drop of oil on her finger , closed the vial , then replaced it . Softly she touched the boy 's forehead with the oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a long while she said nothing at all , then she said , so softly that he barely caught the words , " Lord , what is your will for Jamie ? " Howland was mystified ! He stood there staring , and the silence was so heavy it almost had substance as she continued to wait . The boy did not move and she did not speak again  --  for what seemed like a very long time . Then he saw her head nod , as if she were agreeing with something someone had said . " Lord , we ask you to heal this child . " The boy 's eyes fluttered open . He focused on her and said in a tiny voice , " Hullo , Miss Rachel . " She stooped and gave him a kiss . " Hello , Jamie . " " I 've been sick . " " Yes , but you 'll be fine now . " Rachel rose and there was a peaceful look on her smooth face as she moved past Howland . " I 'd not let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let him have anything very heavy to eat until tomorrow . " " Bless you , Miss Rachel ! " Mrs. Crowley cried out , wiping her eyes with her apron . " God bless you  --  and you , too , sir , " she added as they left the house . They made their way along the street , everyone they met greeting Rachel by name and nodding to Howland . He waited for her to say something about Jamie , but she did not . Finally he said , " You think the child is  --  no longer sick ? " " Jamie ? " she asked in surprise , looking up at him . " Oh , yes , he 's fine . " Then she asked , " Why do you ask ? " " Well  --  " He gave an embarrassed grin , and despite his manner , which was sometimes heavy , she saw that he had humor . " I suppose that I 've had so little success in praying for the sick that it startled me the way you prayed  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking how clear her eyes were , and confessed , " I 'd not be able to do that ! What if he did n't get well ? What would people think ? "  | " I do n't mind what people think , Reverend Howland , " she returned firmly . " God did n't call me to be popular , but to do His will . And the instant you start doubting God 's word , you 're already a failure , are n't you ? " He thought about her words , then shook his head . " Well , doubt comes to me , I confess . Do n't you ever wonder if your prayers will be answered ? " " God has never refused to answer my prayer . " He stopped short and stared at her in disbelief . An elderly couple passed , stopping to turn around and stare at them standing there in the middle of the street . " God has answered every one of your prayers ? " he asked , doubt threading his speech . " I never heard anyone say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth countenance calm and possessed . Her full lips turned up in a smile and she seemed amused by his doubt . " Did n't you teach the eleventh chapter of Mark at Harvard ? " " Why , of course ! " She began to quote it , and her voice was filled with a certainty that held him still . " Jesus answering saith unto them , Have faith in God . For verily I say unto you , That whosoever shall say unto this mountain , be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea ; and shall not doubt in his heart , but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass , he shall have whatsoever he saith . Therefore , I say unto you , What things soever ye desire , when you pray , believe that ye received them , and ye shall have them . " He stared at her , then said , " But  --  surely that 's symbolic ? " " I try to think the Lord Jesus meant exactly what He said . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk . Finally he broke the silence . " I 've never known anyone who saysthat God answers all their prayers . " " Yes , you have ! " He stared in surprise at her certainty , and she laughed . " You know my Grandfather . " " He says that , too ? " " Yes , and my mother . " " I ca n't believe it ! "  | " Reverend Howland  --  " " Please , call me Robert ! " " I like that name ! " she smiled at his invitation . " Well , Robert , I do n't know if I can explain or not , but I 'll try . Years ago , " she began , a distant look filling her dark eyes , " I watched Mother as she prayed , and I saw how God always seemed to answer her . But I had n't experienced that power for myself . It took a crisis  --  a desperate situation  --  to bring me to the realization of my own need for Christ and His power to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's expression intensified as he became drawn into the drama of Rachel 's story . " Yes . I was caught in the middle of an Indian raid on a small village near Plymouth . Someone I cared a great deal about was  --  " She paused , groping for words . " Go on , " Howland encouraged gently . Rachel took a deep breath . " Well , in the midst of all the shouting and burning and bloodshed , something happened insideof me . I called out to the Lord , and He answered  --  really answered  --  and miraculously saved me and a friend from certain death . " Howland let out a long , low whistle . " We were held captive by the Indians for some time , but in some ways I was less captive than I had been all my life . I had been adhering to a ' form of godliness , ' as the scripture says , without experiencing its power . At last I knew Christ 's presence for the first time , and saw Him answer my prayers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that  --  had been a secondhand experiencefrom my mother . " " Is that why you 're so set against the Half-Way Covenant ? " Robert grinned , remembering their last spirited encounter . Rachel laughed lightly . " Let 's not get into that again ! Let 's just say that afterward , I knew Jesus Christ for myself . And since that time He has always answered my prayers . " " But how ? " Howland was still mystified . " Grandfather taught me to pray , and the one thing that makes him different in his praying is that he never asks God to do anything unless he 's sure it 's God 's will . " " I do n't quite understand , " Howland frowned . " How can he always know God 's will ? God may choose not to reveal it . "  | " Then he waits until God does choose to speak . So that 's the way I pray . When we were with Jamie , I was asking God to reveal His will . " " And God told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Howland was skeptical , as he always was of those who had visions and personal words from God , always prefacing their remarks with God told me to say .. . She did not answer immediately . Her face was still as she thought how best to tell him how it was with her . " I do n't hear God , not as I hear you , " she admitted . " But there is a spirit in man , is n't there ? And did n't the Lord Jesus tell us that His Holy Spirit would teach us all things ? " " Well , yes , but I do n't think that means  --  concrete things . " " Why not ? " she asked simply . " Do n't you think Jesus is interested in the things we do ? Does n't He care about Jamie more than you or I ever could ? " " Yes , God cares , but  --  " " He said , ' My sheep hear my voice , ' did n't He ? " All this was making Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change the topic , but she did not notice his agitation . " I asked God if it was His will to heal Jamie  --  and in my spirit I felt that He said yes . So I simply prayed for what God already wanted to do . And he is healed . " Her eyes filled with tears , and she whispered , " Praise the Lord , for His mercies are everlasting ! " All this was a far different thing from studying a dusty book on the subject Praying for the Sick , and Howland was certain that the woman was a victim of rank emotionalism . He had been carried away by the charm of the family ; now he suddenly resolved to spend less time in their company . But he was committed to the fish supper , so he went with her to the home of the local pastor , Reverend Samuel Parris . Parris lived in a small brick house in the center of the village . As they approached the house , a black woman opened the door . " Hello , Tituba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home ? " " Yes , he with Miss Betty . " At that moment a thin man with close-set eyes and a harried expression entered the hall . He was followed by two **26;15110;TOOLONG , and I was rocking slightly , shifting on my legs , gettingmy whole body into my arms . " It may be only those years with Anson that you need to understand . They were celibate years , I gather ? " " They were that . " He sighed , deeply and inexplicably , a slight tremor runningthrough his body . Then I took more oil and moved up to his thighs . " It was thirteen years ago . I was fifty and in a crisis of faith . The episodic nature of my life and my imaginings during my rise to prominence had kept me in a state of mind where action , purely political and secular , focused my thoughts and behavior . It had been many little steps , circumscribedintrigues , but then I found myself close to arrival , and it was almost like a certain illness , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let alone tie them . Christ still moved for me , in the sacristy and in the host , but His presence now felt perfunctory , and I began to wonder if I was imagining it . " Then a letter came , very much like the box that you received , an invitation to a high school class reunion in Utah . I put it aside , but in a few days went back to it , fingered it , and studied its embossed lettering . It had been thirty-three years , and I did not recognize the names of the secretary or class president . Even the name of the school , Nativity , printed in gold lettering at the top of the creamy linen paper was distant and odd to me , an emblem from a life that seemed so foreign that I wondered if I had possibly made it up or dreamed it . " I thought it over , really not considering it at all at first , but as I thought of it , thought of college and the seminary , the loose ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tentative at first , until I began to feel that tying them up might be possible . Nativity , the letters in the stone above the large door , and then the classrooms , the dust of the playground , the smell of incense , the vaguely remembered shape of the goblet that I held carefully in myp61role as altar boy , the hands of the old priest , Father Ghinty , taking it from me and raising it . And then the boy 's bathroom , the stall doors , blue uniform pants in a pile on scuffed shoes , pocked white legs rising out of them . And names  --  Eddie Condra , Cora Cooper , Burl McGee  --  faces , and the veiled figures of the nuns , their beads swinging and clacking along their narrow hips . " And in a while , what I thought was most of it , at least the exact flavor and feel of it , was there for me , and I decided that I would go , and by going I would find and understandthose pieces from my past that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I laid my work off on subordinates and applied for a week 's recuperative leave . While deciding on my packing , I came across my old school sweater and cap . I remember I held them to my face and smelled them . " The school and grounds of Nativity had not changed much . I arrived three days early on a Thursday , and after I had checked in to the old hotel in the town center and changed into civilian clothing , I rented a car and drove out to the school . The distances seemed shorter , and I lost my way a few times , but when I reached the right neighborhoodI found my way easily , though there was nothing , no landmark , that was familiar . It was summer ; the school was empty and deserted , and I walked among the low rectangularbuildings that housed the classrooms , standing on my toes and looking through windows . The old church was open , and when I entered it I was shocked to see that it was no longer a church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frames was familiar ; what had . been stained glass was now plate . " Christ , I should have known better , should have got a hint from the way I let memory flood in selectively , pushingsome away , letting my eyes rest only on what warmed me , pausing at the door of the boy 's bathroom , but not entering . I roamed the school and grounds for an hour or more , and I found my spirits rising . Before I left , I went to the new church building , lit a candle to the Holy Mother ,  |p62and  knelt and prayed with a seriousness that I had not experienced in years . When I left I felt clean and wholesome . " The night of the party I dressed carefully , wearing the dark suit of my calling and my stiff linen collar . I brushed my hair , smiling at the beginnings of gray at my temples . My stomach was flat then , and in the carefully tailored suit I was wearing I looked fit and healthy . I was right in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had indulged in just a hint of vanity , having my nails manicured the afternoon before . There had been only women in the beauty parlor , some muffled laughing that a man , a priest , would go there and do such a thing . " In the failing light of the evening and the bright and colored artificial lighting that flooded out of the old church windows , Nativity was transformed and hardly recognizable . I parked my car close to a row of classrooms , and as I passed the drinking fountains and numbered doors I heard the sound of recorded music , popular songs from years ago , and noted the loops of colored streamers that had been hung from the low outdoor ceiling of the passage . There were forty or so people standing in groups and alone on the gymnasium floor of the old church when I entered it . Long portable tables , covered with various molds , dips , and plattersof food , lined the walls , and there were four couples dancing , stiff and slow in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various class objects , sweaters , banners , and sports uniforms , hanging from nails on the walls . A woman of my own age greeted me , standing at a table at the door when I entered . I did not recognize her . " Father . Johnny ? Is that you ? ' she said , and came up to me fluttering , holding a white nametag in her hand . She smiled , somewhat conspiratorially . " Well , look at you now ! ' And she pinned the tag to my lapel . " Hello , Jan , ' I said , reading the name on her tag . " She steered me into the gym , and after I had gone to a table and gotten a drink , I stood awkwardly to the side , feigning interest in the dancing couples.  | " The room was filled gradually as the party progressed . People came up to me briefly , winking and introducing spouses . I recognized some of them vaguely , but had no memory of time spent with them . Then , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright-colored sports jacket , I saw Cora , recognized her and remembered her instantly . In a moment her head turned my way , her face brightened , and I saw her mouth form my name . She pulled the sleeve of the man beside her , bent to him and spoke briefly , and then the pair turned from the table and approached me . As they were coming , I looked over their shoulders , and on the far side of the room , alone beside a makeshift case of trophies , I saw and recognized Burl ; he seemed as thin and delicate as he had been over thirty years before . " I was illegitimate . The one you thought my mother was my aunt , ' Cora said . She had gotten free of the man she was with , and we were standing alone to the side of the gym floor . The man was not her husband , just an acquaintance . She had never married . " Cora 's illegitimacy was only the first revelation of the evening , a shocking one indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been my very closest friend . I 'd visited her house , spent most of my free time with her , and to learn now that the life she had lived was false , her mother not her mother , did an odd thing to me , strangely falsifying my own past , something I had put away and only now thought I was regaining . " Did you know it then ? ' I said . " Of course I did . I think most everybody did . We were both outsiders , you and I. Is n't that why we stuck to-gether ? ' " I did n't know what she meant . " Why did n't you tell me ? ' I said . " I thought you knew ! ' she said . Most everybody did . Do n't you remember how they shunned me , shunned us ? They thought we were both dirty , foreign and odd . ' " I was stunned by Cora 's revelation , and after we had spoken of it and got beyond it , I was saddened that therep64seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our years together , of things we 'd done . They were coming back to me , in their detail , in her presence . But I felt they were nothing for us to speak of . They would be hurtful in light of this new knowledge , a learning that would make them somehow inauthentic . In any story there would be the line , that I had not known , and this would make the story itself libelous , tainted and unwholesome . Just as I had reached her , had reached some centering in my past , all had begun to dissolve . " We freed each other , when we could do so with grace . It was clear that Cora did n't want that , but it was clear too that she understood . I saw pain in her eyes as she turned away , and when I caught her looking at me from across the room later , I tried hard not to look back . " I spent some time looking for other involvements then , but all I found were strained . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most I saw a look in faces and eyes that was troublesome , off-putting and vaguely disapproving . For an hour I could not find Burl in the gathering , but then he appeared again , alone as before , standing near the entrance to the gym . His eyes fell when I caught them , but in a moment his head rose and he looked at me , his eyes large and glistening . " I have to talk to you , Johnny ... Father , ' he said . " I had crossed the room to him . He had not watched meas I approached , but I could tell he knew I was coming . " Talk , ' I said . I 'm listening . ' " He glanced around us , a little furtive . There was a coupleacross the room who seemed to be watching us , their heads close together , talking . I saw another who seemed to be doing the same . " Not here , ' he said . He was shaking slightly , his arms hanging awkwardly at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glancing quickly over at it . " They 're watching , ' he said . Can we go outside ? ' There was a plea in his voice , a slight elevation in his tone.  | " Of course , ' I said , and followed his thin body out of the room . " In the passageway there were people coming and going , couples laughing lightly and talking with animation . Burl glanced at them . This is no good either , ' he said , and he quit my side and went to the classroom door closest to us and rattled the knob . The room was locked , and I watched him go to another door , try that also , then drop his hands in frustration . " Burl , ' I said . Over there . The boys ' room . ' " He glanced sharply at me , a stricken look in his face . I saw his Adam 's apple bob as he swallowed . Then he took his lower lip in his teeth , turned from me and crossed to the sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter , and disappearin the darkness . I looked around me , found that the passage was now empty , and went to the boys ' room and entered also . " Burl , ' I whispered when I got inside . There was only a dim , yellow night-light glowing in the ceiling . The porcelainon the low sinks and urinals showed in the yellow wash ; the stalls were no more than vague outlines in the dark . The light made the place seem dirty , and I felt grit under my feet as I shifted them , getting my bearings . " Here . ' I heard Burl 's muffled voice in the darkness , the sound coming from a stall to the back of the room . I put my hand out , feeling along the doors , and when I got to the stall beside the one from which his voice had come , I pushed the door on its silent hinges . What light there was entered , and I could see the dirty yellow porcelain of the bowl , the low black seat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seat . It was so low my knees almost reached my chin . " Burl ? ' I said . What is it ? ' and felt the breath of a foot shuffling under the side of the stall separating us . " Johnny , it 's been hell , ' he said . This is a small town . All these years . You were smart to get out of it . ' " I remembered Burl , thin as he was now , almost thep66same size it seemed . He was always apart , a loner , more left alone than desiring it , I thought . Never even the butt of jokes or tricks , there had been a sadness about him that could not be lifted , even in part , by the high quality of his schoolwork . Even the nuns shunned him , grudgingly acknowledginghis intelligence , the cool , conventional exactnessof his answers and papers . And as his disembodied voice drifted under the edge of the stall wall , I remembered something else , a day after school and the two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch of small , rigid flesh , the lights dim as they were now , a sliver of late afternoonsun slicing in at a high window . " Burl , ' I said . I do n't understand . ' But I think I was beginning to understand , something at least , at least that the thing that concerned him had to do with that day , a day buried and forgotten , childish and insignificant , and only rising up as the hint of a smile crossed a face , at times , over the years ; nothing really , a raw , ignorant experimentation of two schoolboys , a moment of guilt , snubbed and forgottenand never even spoken of in the confessional . " They knew , ' Burl whispered , a choke in his voice . They all knew ! ' " Knew what ? ' I said , the question only a suggestion that he continue . " They seen us . Over the edge , ' he said . Some kids ; I do n't know who . ' " And I imagined their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring , their dirty hands , and their eyes looking down at us , so close , from above . They seen us , to use Burl 's words . He had lapsed into the poor grammar of childhood , and now he was talking again . " And they told everybody ! And they have n't let me forget it yet . ' " There was a silence ; I was about to speak . What differencecould it make ? It was years ago . I was a priest now , almost a bishop . " Bless me , Father , ' he said , for I have sinned . My last confession was ten years ago . I ..  | " Stop it ! ' I said , sharply . " I disobeyed my mother seven times , and in those years I have been with men . I had bad thoughts against associates .. " Burl , ' I said more gently , but with insistence . That 's enough now . You must stop . It 's all right . ' " It is not all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I could hear his choking breath , the scrape of his shoe against the gritty floor . " We sat there . And there was finally no good solace that I could give him . He spoke somewhat abstractly , about the way people had treated him , muffled laughter and whispers in public places . He said that he had gone out of town , but that it had followed him , possibly not the particulars of the thing , but some advanced sense of who he was , what he was , so that he was not quite taken seriously . " I thought of the women in the beauty parlor , their laughter as my nails were manicured . And as he spoke , I thought he had become the thing he feared , had taken on some permanent guilt or self-fulfilling expectation , and that maybe the cause was forgotten , by everyone but him . I was n't sure though , and I could not find a way to soothe him . " He left in a while , making his way quickly out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I reached the passagewayhe was gone . I went and looked for Cora , but she was gone too . The party was over , only a few stragglers standing in corners of the gymnasium talking . " Even now , as I tell the story , I feel the overblown nature of the thing , the burgeoning of insignificant details that lead to an arrival in a childhood bathroom and an event that stands , in every world but my own , as no more than a cipher . For how many did a thing like this occur ? Who has not been furtive and experimental in this way ? The whole thing rings hollow in any significant scheme of things . All I know is that when I got back to the hotel , had removed my neat and careful vestments and had turned the light out and gotten into bed , the thing began to flood in on me , all thosep68years that had formed a ground of origins and become fixed were now like a diorama , rotating slightly on some platform , until ego 's center among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself as a loner then , but one who had come to that state out of some fate or choice . I was to be a priest . I knew this by the time I was twelve years old , and that resolution is what had set me apart , a celebrated oddity , good at studies , adequate at sports , invited to parties , vaguely respected by nuns and priests , aside , but also above the crowd . But now the remembered looks and glances of fellow students took on a new significance . They seen us , ' he had said . They all knew . ' And it was possible that had I not stood alone , had not flaunted my calling , I would not have become that odd spectacle , a boy who plays with other boys who would soon become a priest who would eventually listen to the sins of others in confessional . The looks and glances in my memory now became derisive , cheapening , and I saw myself as a ludicrousfigure , a pompus fool among the normal . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's slow crushing under the weight of lurid accusation , so how could I have known the half of it when it came to my own place in things ? Each remembered event was changing now , and I began even to question my time in seminary , a place only a few miles from Nativity . I had been a loner there as well , a student whose concern was with Church politics rather than theology . And I thought now that it was possible that what I took as a certain austerity in my figure was yet again a ludicrousness . They seen us . ' Had that seeing traveled to the seminary as well ? " And so the platform of the past , the figured matrix I only realized as I regained it was what I stood upon , twisted and warped even as I called it up from memory . And that changed me . I had a lapse of faith that was permanent . I saw the novitiate of my past as little more than a joke for others , and in seeing that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke as well . I was an inauthentic figure , anp69image of a lie , all the more profound because it was a public one . When I took my vows of office , a year later , I ignored the words . Now I am successful as a politician . I say my daily Mass with charts and appointments in my head . That evening at Nativity could have been avoided . That 's a romanticand nostalgic regret . What it brought me to is so large that I try not to think of it at all . It would be a constantdespair . If I were you , I would n't go back . "  |p70When  I returned from the Bishop 's place , it was close to midnight and I was tired . But before I went to bed I got the box out again and shuffled through its contents . I put Melchior 's card aside , together with the letter from Anne and Carl , those messages from the past , and while I was puzzling at the ticket stubs and looking at Lorca 's two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had sent me , two weeks after her leaving . It had been a note really , a few hasty sentences , and her parents had received one of their own at around the same time . Dear David , the note had said . Maybe you 'll never forgive this . I do n't know . I had to leave . I ca n't really know what to say to make it easier . Take whatever you want . I 'll not write again . Lorca . The envelope was postmarked Phoenix , Arizona.  |p71I  never did hear from her again . She left most of her clothes ; some boxes , heavy and taped shut ; and a variety of folders and never-used wedding gifts . The folders containedpictures of flowers mostly , ones she had cut out of magazines for her drawings . The one she kept gardenias in went with her . I took very little when I left , just enough to set up house . I set Lorca 's note aside in my mind and took up the brighter , actual one from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good life in Northern California . I read it through , and then got paper and envelope and wrote a brief note to them , putting in please forward below the address . Then I dropped the letter in the chute in the dark hallway outside my apartment door . The next few weeks were spent getting the last details of my affairs in order . I wrote a letter to the Bishop and cards to a few other customers , those that I had some firm relationship with . Anson 's money , which he had transferred into my name in the weeks before his death , was safe in bank certificates . I cashed one in , for five thousand , and depositedthe money in my checking account . Then I arranged for a car lease and notified my landlord and the movers . There was really very little to move , and I decided on storage in New Jersey . I finished quicker than I had anticipated , and spent my last week free of tasks . I walked the streets of this city that I had grown to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving , and each thing I saw again took on the history of my years in New York , already touched with the beginnings of nostalgia . The day before I left , I received a letter from Anne . I was just going to try to call them that evening . I could almost hear Anne 's voice in the mute words on the page , slightly formal as it had been , but fruity and welcoming . She hoped I could stay for a while , we could talk about the old days . Carl had some part-time work at the college , but he was not all that busy and could find time . There were three children now . I wrote a quick postcard in answer . It said I could make it inp72about a week . I 'd call from the road . After I 'd dropped the card in the chute in the hallway , I fixed a drink . The living room was bare of everything now , so I sat at the kitchen table . I wondered what the town would be like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California . I wondered what they would be like now , if they would be in any way like I remembered them . Lorca was sitting in a chair in her white shorts and halter , her hair gathered above her neck in a loose bun held up with numerous bobby pins , a few wet strands stuck against her cheek and ear . Her legs were wet and shining with perspiration . The faint red clay dust from the court had soiled her white socks and her calves above them . She was leaning back in the chair , white wicker and cushioned , and her legs were spread , her thighs resting against the poles of the chair arms . Her nose glistened , and there were droplets of perspiration on her dark eyebrows . She was smiling , her eyes focused above my head . I heard Carl moving in another room and felt Anne 's fingers digging into my shoulders , searching along the muscles . " That 's good , " I said , lifting my chin up , seeing her forehead as she leaned over me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moving her fingers up to my neck . " This is possibly one of the best days , " Lorca said . She turned her head to the window , through which the sun streamed , then back a little as Carl entered the room carrying a tray with glasses of iced tea . " It would be better if the tennis had been a little better , " he said . The four of us laughed , and he handed a glass to Lorca and one to me , glancing over my head a little sharply at Anne . The women were much better players than we were . It was tennis that had gotten them together in the first place , and they suffered our participation with them in it . Most of the good rallies were between them . They did n't much like doubles at all , but would let us in on it occasionally . Anne let go of my neck and went to a chair . We talked ofp73the day , particular rallies , the poor shape of the college courts , the emptiness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was just checking musculature , his spinal alignment , you know , " Anne said . Lorca laughed , but a little awkwardly , and Carl lifted his hands in mock frustration . He had a way of gesturing that was odd , as if each time he was just learning to do it . " Nevertheless , " I said , " it sure felt good . " The afternoon wore on . We talked of examinations , and Anne and Carl talked of their move . He had landed a job working the ski slopes up north , repairing them in summers , ski patrol during the season . Maybe he could pick up a little part-time teaching , intro to philosophy or something , at the junior college . Anne would try to find something in physiotherapy when they got set up there . Carl had plans for a few weeks of climbing in Yosemite . I still had a few courses to finish during the summer . Lorca was done , but she had no job at all yet and was n't looking . Her drawing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , she had gotten a few pieces , some flower drawings , into a traveling show sponsored by a bank , one of those with branches throughout the West . But nothing had followed that , and now she was working with paints as well as pen and ink . She had only studied in a formal way in a few elective courses at the university . What she had to learn was made harder through a lot of trial and error . She was tenacious about the painting , though , and it had begun to absorb her . There was still some student loan money left , though not much . The free rent of the little house behind her parents ' helped , but I 'd have to get something soon , before summer 's end . " I 'm going to miss them , " Lorca said . We were back at the little house . She had showered , washing the sweat and red dust away , and now she sat in a chair in her robe , the strands of her long , black hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulders . Her look was slightly abstracted , her eyes unfocused wherep74they rested , a little to the left of my face as she spoke . I wanted to shake her , to bring her back from the edge of her reverie that had its object in Carl and Anne but was I knew larger than that and really unknown to me . For a while now she had been slipping , secretive and reticent . I would catch her at times in a posture of reading , finding she was not reading but looking a little above the page , her thoughts elsewhere . " I 'll miss Anne at least , " she said . " We can visit them . " " Yeah , we can do that , " but there was no conviction in her voice at all . " There 's something bothering you . Something else . " " No , " she said . " No , there 's nothing . " " Do you want something ? " I asked . She shifted in her seat , as if the robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its folds that bothered her . Her chin tipped in a lovely way of hers , and her eyes moved back to my own , the hint of a smile touching the corners of her mouth . " I want a rub , " she said . " Something to fix my bones . " And she uncurled her legs and got up from the chair and opened her robe and let it fall at her feet , stood naked before me for a moment , then turned and walked to the bed and stretched out on her stomach on the cover . I turned the light down to the lowest bulb then and moved over to her and began to work her . Her body was lean , but her buttocks and breasts were soft and full . I could see the bulge of her flattened breasts below her armpits , as she stretched her arms up above her head . I pooled oil in my palm , then ran my hands from the back of her knees up her thighs , cupping the lobes of her buttocks from below , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I slid to her thin waist , pressing my thumbs along the structure of her sacrum . She moaned deeply , and when I looked down I saw her toes curling . I worked her back and shoulders , digging in slightly where the muscles were tight and bunched , and when Ip75reached her neck , I slid my fingertips around her head to the temples , rotating the skin in small circles . Then I saw that she was covered and glistening with oil and that a small sweat had risen from her pores , and I moved back to her feet and began to massage her in earnest . She had her face buried in the cover , her shoulders pushed up a little , and in the dim light the curve of her back looked like the body of a dolphin , almost as dark as that , her relaxing muscles elongating under the sheath of her dark skin . There was , through her muffled breathing , some sense of articulation , as if she were talking in some deeply gutteral language , words mixed with moans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fingers between her toes , pressed into the pads , cupped her arches in my palms , held her ankles and pulled her legs back . Then I worked beyond her ankles , holding and moving her muscular calves . I was thinking about what I was doing , watching her body as it relaxed , but I had no idea what she was thinking about at all . She brought her head up for air once , stretching her neck out , and then returnedher face to the blanket . I saw her buttocks tighten as she moved , then relax again , the dark place where her thighs entered the cup of her pelvis opening . And in a while I had my pants off and was on my knees behind her , entering her , holding her oiled waist in my hands . She was up on her extended arms , her head elevated again . I could see the cowl of her hanging hair , but not a bit of her face . She seemed to be looking into the wall in front of her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her waist to her spine , digging in again , massaging , and when I held her buttocks I was reaching into the muscles there also . Finally she shuddered and collapsed , and I was stretched out upon her , my hands still moving , rubbing her as she had wished . Lorca . I remember a sunny disposition , a lilting laugh , and a lean body moving with certain grace over the court . I remember a hand touching a small spit curl , and a brow empty of all care . In the summers we went into the moun/tains , and she was inquisitive and open . She was committed to her studies as well as her drawing and painting , and her glasses slid to a perch near the end of her nose while she was reading . She liked music , though she admitted to knowing nothing much about it . She seemed to have no secretlife at all , happy to live in the little house behind the one in which she was born . I remember how well it had all seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awoke in the oily sheets , I found a note from her saying that she was at the library . It was Sunday , but exam week was beginning and the universitywas open . In the early afternoon , I went to meet her , to surprise her , but she was not there . She was at home when I returned , cooking dinner , cheerful , but slightly abstracted . She had taken a shower and was in her robe again . Her hair was wet , and she looked very much the way she had the night before . She was turned away from me , workingat a chopping board and talking . She said she had met someone , had found a job at a dress shop in Hollywood . " That 's great ! " I said . " At the library ? " " Oh , yes ! " she said , and when she turned to me I was startled by her flush.  |p77There  were two goats , a pair of swans , four cats , a German shepherd , a tall Afghan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet the yard behind the house seemed in a strange way orderly . It was large and hilly and bordered by a hedge of tended plantings and indigenous growth  --  cactus , clipped-back yucca , privet , and some desert flowers twined in among them . There was a small pond in a lower tier of the yard , a small oval set under the limbs of a young redwood , and here the swans drifted against each other in small circles . The last border of the yard was the house itself , a large ranch-style structure , and a door from the kitchen led into the yard , into a profusion of potted and hanging plants , birdbaths and feeders . Abbey was up on the pony , her legs hanging free of the stirrups of the tooled western saddle , her hands cupped over the horn , and leaning forward . She wore a long , color/ful caftan , hitched up to her thighs ; she was barefoot and her toes almost touched the ground at the pony 's sides . She had rushed ahead of me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already mounted . " Do you like Oozo ? " she said , arching her back and smiling . " That 's his name , Oozo . " I entered the yard and moved toward them , the Afghan watching me ; she was poised beside a birdbath , the small pond at her right shoulder . When I got between the two goats , the male moved into my knee , butting hard against it . " He does that all the time , " Abbey said . " He does n't want you between them . " I pulled up , and the male skipped around in front of me , banging into the side of the female , pushing her off toward the house . " It 's a nice pony , " I said , and she lifted the reins , heeled him lightly in the flanks and turned him in a tight circle . She was ten years old , but dressed and acting like an adolescentgirl a few years older . Her ears were pierced . Long hoops hung from them , and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she said . There was a ruckus at the door behind me , and when I turned I saw a girl and boy , about seven and nine , I thought , rush into the yard and come up to me . The boy grabbed me around the waist , hugging me , his grip tight and his head pressed into my side . " Hi , David , " he said . " You 're David . " He held me , pushing into me , making no move at all to let me go . I saw the girl reach out and pull at his shoulder . " He does that all the time , " Anne said . She was standing in the doorway , as lovely and young looking as I remembered her in my past , though I thought I noticed some lines of care at the corners of her eyes . " Let him go now , Coppie ; that 's enough . " I had gotten to Sharonville late the night before . The drive cross-country had been very much like a dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped away from me . At a turnpike rest stop a little to the east of Cleveland , I picked up a young man who was hitchhiking at the onramp . He was a boy really , no more than sixteen , and he sat stiff in the seat beside me and was awkward and reticent in our brief snatches of conversation . I took him to the other side of Omaha and on into the plains , where he left me at a help wanted sign at a gas station a little off the highway . He was thin and fair and looked weak to me , and once in a room we shared , him sleeping on the smaller bed beside my own as Anson had in his last days , I awakened in the middle of the night to see him standing at the window . He was hunched over , leaning against the glass . It was raining , and I could see his thin shoulders shake as he wept , quietly and privately , looking out into the parking lot . I remembered the look of Omaha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but west of that city it had gotten hot , and I had been driving during the nights , sleeping in small motels in the daytime . It seemed no more than a trip through diminishing lights , those coming up in the windshieldand those set back in mountains and desert . Faint country music on the radio , breakfast at two A.M. Still , time had passed , a week almost , and though the passage had been dim , I had recognition of a great distance between where I now was and New York City . And the distance was more than one of space . I felt out of my recent past completely , not forward into some future but in some kind of suspension , not yet in a distant past , not anywhere yet , though I felt the sight of Carl and Anne could push me in that direction . The town was small , and though it was only ten o'clock when I entered it , it was fast asleep . On the way in from the highway , I passed what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching , a ramble of low adobe-like buildings , copies of that in a modern style , on a piece of barren land with blacktop drives running fromp80building to building . In the town center the only lights were those in the windows of a bar , a few cars parked in front of it . There was a bright moon , and beyond the center I could see the low foothills , and in the distance the shadowsof the larger mountains that ran all the way to the Pacificcoast . I had seen no place to stay on the way in , and there was nothing apparent in the town center , really an intersection of two streets with a dozen or so stores near their joining , so I decided to call Carl . There was a brightly lit phone booth to the side of the door of the bar . I had called once from the road , two days before . A child had answeredand taken a message . When Carl picked me up , he was wearing the same dark winter coat I had remembered him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not that cold here in Sharonville . We embraced briefly by the side of his car . He pulled away quickly and took my hand and shook it , and when he stepped further back I noticed the coat and mentioned it . He looked the same , still lean and straight , and only the faint strands of gray in his dark hair suggested that he had aged . We spoke briefly , and I followed him in my car . It was only eleven when we got to his house , but everyone was asleep , and there was only a dim night-light illuminatingthe glass-walled living room where I was to bed down . He had inflated a large , thick air mattress , placing it close to the curve of a grand piano that stood in a corner . We spoke briefly again when he brought blankets and pillow . He suggested a brandy , in a whisper , but I said , " Let 's not wake them up ; we can talk in the morning . " He showed me the bathroom , beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we said good night . I awoke in the morning with a slight pain in my shoulder , and when I shifted my body against it I found that the mattress had lost air during the night and that I was resting in the middle of two large billows of air , the side of my body on the floor itself . As I rolled over in the waves , I caught a glimpse of the naked back and buttocks of a woman , and knew even before I was completely orientedp81that it was Anne . She was standing beside her bed , holding a garment in front of her , and her image was reflected in a mirror in the hall outside her open door . She was not moving ; I thought she might be thinking , planning something . She had the body of a young girl , dark and perfect skin , her buttocks firm and elevated . I could see a good portion of the small single bed beside her legs , and I wondered about it vaguely . Watching her , I caught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when I looked back the mirror was empty . The room I was in was large and rectangular . There was a massive stone fireplace , freestanding , two thirds of the way down the rectangle in the middle of the room , to the side of which I could see a dining room table . I guessed that the kitchen was beyond the other side . The long wall to my left was sliding glass doors , and beyond them lay a redwooddeck . Drapes were pulled over the glass doors at my end of the room , keeping the morning sun out . The furniture was heavy and Spanish , couches and coffee tables well out from the walls in various groupings . Along the wall behind the piano at my head was a stereo setup and shelves of records and books . The other long wall of the room was hung with paintings and prints , neoprimitive Indian works mostly , and there were wooden shelves bolted to the wall below them on which rested various pots and urns . A glass door near the dining table was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed stiffly to the bathroom , I could feel a pleasantbreeze against my legs under my robe . There were familiar things in the bathroom , an open white wicker shelf unit containing them . Oils and lotions I remembered from college , colognes and perfumes that Carl and Anne had worn even then . In a clear crystal jar on the rack was the green , organic look of marijuana . I lifted the jar 's top and confirmed it . I remembered a brush and comb , a specific brand of bobby pin , the smell of herbal soap . I dressed myself among these familiar scents and some unfamiliarones , talcum and kid 's toothpaste . There was a small window in the bathroom , and I could see the yard be/yond it . The swans sat in a morning mist in the small pool , and the pony stood half asleep among hanging planters . I could see movement in the short wing of the house that was the children 's quarters , lights brightening as curtains were pulled aside . When I reached the table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the smaller girl , Dana , who lifted her head brightly from her cereal bowl as I approached . The boy was not there yet , but I could hear him talking in the kitchen beyond the wall . Just as I was sitting down , I heard Anne call my name , then felt her hand on my shoulder , her hair and then her lips as she kissed my cheek . After she had brought out juice in a stone pitcher , and eggs and sausage , she joined us and made careful introduction of her two daughters . " Where 's the boy ? " I said . The girls laughed , Carl looked straight ahead , and Anne shifted a little in her chair . " He does n't eat breakfast , " Dana said . " He 'll gulp somethingdown in the kitchen . " The girls giggled and poked each other , and after breakfastand the first tentative beginnings of the small talk that would get us to the larger things , we went out to the animalsin the yard . The driving force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporarily attenuated and lost in the muddle of events and reaquaintances during my few days with Carl and Anne . The intention itself , though it drove me , was nothing I clearly understood . There had been the arrival of the box , then the first tentative steps with Melchior . I knew it was all traceable to Anson and the painful yet liberating release from my ten years with him . The final year had been a kind of bondage of caring and tending , of trying to somehow right previous years , of settinga life that was passing into some order in which it could be understood . Not Anson 's life , I realized after his death , but my own . Perhaps it was the Bishop finally , his story that had perversely moved me . I knew my resolvep83had focused in the days after I left him for the last time . I would go back , that much was sure . But what I would go back to , what I expected and wanted , had no clarity to it at all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days before Carl and I left . Something about a woman at that dress shop , as I remember . " We were sitting in the living room after lunch that first day . Carl had put a quiet chamber music tape on the recorder , and large photographs of Yosemite were scattered on the glass coffee table around which we sat . It was Saturday , and the two girls were out , playing at the house of some friend . Coppie sat on the couch beside me , his head against my side , his thin arms around my waist , holding tight . I shifted a little at the discomfort of his squeeze , pattedhis head , and looked at Anne . " It 'll be enough for him in a while , " she said , smiling faintly and without pleasure . " Coppie , it 's almost time to feed the animals , " Carl said somewhat sharply , but the boy just pressed his head into me , snuggling closer . He was tucked under my right arm , and it was difficult for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch him would be to encourage him , so I lay my arm along the back of the sofa , straining a bit at the shoulder . Carl stared at the boy , unblinking , but I could n't read the emotion in his look , did n't know if he was angry or curious . " I 've never been there , " I said . " There 's Salt Lake City , I guess , but I have no picture of it . " " I do n't think it was there , anyway , " Anne said . " It was the clothes Lorca said she was buying , too casual and outdoorsyfor that . " For lunch we had a salad . I had seen a gathering of large ripe avocados and artichokes drying on a cart near the kitchen door , but we had not eaten them . Coppie had eaten with us this time , using his fingers , munching at the lettuce and onions like a small animal at my shoulder . He reminded me of what I thought Anson might have been like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidance of parents.  |p84Anne  had her legs pulled up under her on the couch across from me , and when she shifted and her legs parted I could see into the darkness between her knees . Carl shuffledthrough the photographs , looking for the one he had told me about , a day a year or so ago when he and others had made a continuous assault on El Capital , a sheer and rocky ascent in Yosemite . The photos were full of the shapes of huge rock pillars , cottony clouds , and slate sky . They were scattered over the glass coffee table and on the couch . " Here 's the one , " he said , and reached a floppy glossy across to me . His voice was slightly portentous , almost pompous , as he pointed out dots that were figures , like fly specks on the sheer rock face . I could make out hairs that were ropes , possible arms and legs . " Which one are you ? " I said , and he took the photograph back and studied it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Who are the other two ? " " Kip and Banyon , I bet , " Coppie said softly into my shoulder , and then released me and got up from the couch and headed for the kitchen . " Anyway , " Anne said , moving her hands  --  I noticed they had been gripped tight in her lap as she moved them  --  and running them along her legs , " the woman was buying many things , all of them bright and colorful , things that could be worn in layers , winter or summer . She told Lorca the colors were against the environment , to bring some variety and brightness with her into the place . Or maybe that was just Lorca 's idea of it . I 'm not sure . " " Utah ? " I said . " Right . Red rock , and dust , I guess . Lorca was taken with the idea . Or something . There was something about art involved in it , I think . " She fell silent then , glancing at Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass windows of the room . " And that 's it ? " I said . " No . Not all of it . It 's that she talked about it , was some/what insistent about the woman , their talking , and the clothing . She was a very old woman , as I remember . I thought she talked more about it than the situation warranted . " She shook her head and her long straight hair , not unlike what I remembered of Lorca 's , rustled on each of her shoulders . That evening we ate fresh Washington salmon , salad full of chunks of avocado , and cold artichoke . The children joined us , Coppie again sitting close to my side . Dana told me the names of all the animals , and Abbey asked me if I would watch her ride the pony again after dinner . " But to bed early , " Anne said . The girls scowled a little , but were soon bright and cheerful again . " This is like when Banyon was here , " Coppie said softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I said . " Just somebody who was here for a while , " Carl said . " Or Kip , " Coppie whispered again . " That 's enough now , " Anne said gently . " Eat your fish . " Coppie nuzzled against me , then picked up his fork again . I wanted to ask who Kip was , learn something about Banyon , but before I could ask anything Carl spoke . " Kip was just another guy who was here for a while . This is different , Coppie . " " Will Karla be here tomorrow ? " the boy asked plaintively . " Yes , tomorrow , " Anne said . " I 'll be here too , " I said , and the children laughed . Later that evening , when the children were in bed , Carl started a fire and we sat in the living room , drinking tequila from low stone mugs . Earlier , I had watched Abbey ride , steering the pony in various tight turns and mincing steps . Dana and Coppie had stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abbey 's toes touched the ground as the pony moved . The two goats had sidled up to us , as if they too were watching , and the dogs had lain close to each other as the twilight came on . At one point Coppie looked up at me.  | " This is like Banyon and Kip , " he said . " So it 's possible she went to Utah , " I said . Carl had put a tape on the machine , this time quiet jazz . There were lights in the room , but they were dim , and the wall of glass that opened onto the deck was opaque , the night only a blacknessbeyond it . I had been to the end of the deck , to the side of what I found was Carl 's bedroom . I could see a partition through the window , separating the room where Anne slept from his . There was a single bed in each . At the end of these odd sleeping quarters , a small deck cantilevered out from the large one , reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tub hot ? " Anne said . " Right . I gave it a push this morning , " Carl said . " Her mother did n't say anything about that in the note , just that she had heard nothing from her , " I said . We had n't as yet gotten to our past in the way that Melchiorand I had tried to get there ; there had been enough with the children and animals , seeing the place , and learningabout their current lives . Anne seemed to feel the weight of the children a little . Carl had his work on the ski slopes and those few philosophy courses at the college , but she had all she could do to stay connected to her therapy at the prison that stood at the foot of the higher mountains a few miles from the town . " What 's it like there ? " I said . " At the prison ? Oh , mostly old down-and-outers , arthritic . The doctor is a real hack . Not much that 's interesting , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd think it would be good , " he said . " You know , the underlife in some way . " He was speaking to me , but it was Anne who answered . " It is n't , " she said . I could tell she wanted to get back to Lorca . She spoke of a woman she had found there , a good player . But the courts were poor , she said , even worse than those at the college in L.A. She meant the ones we had gone to together , and she was beginning to get back there , mentioning things thatp87had happened , some of which I could recall , others that I had no memory of at all . " Remember the way our hands used to ache ? When they had us doing three-hour stints at the table ? You 'd do my hands for me , while Lorca and Carl were studying . " I remembered something of the sort , but only once . And yet she spoke of it as if it had been a common enough occurrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same program . " It 's getting late , " Carl said . " It 's early yet , " she said . " We have to get ready for Karla , " he said , " and the ducks . " " Is that much to do ? " she said . There was a certain quiet civility between them . They looked directly at each other when they spoke , but there was too much formality , and I could n't tell if my discomfortcame from that or from my not knowing what they were talking about . " What ducks ? " I said . " Who 's Karla ? " " Oh Karla ! " Anna said , stretching her body up a little and laughing . " She 's a photographer . Takes pictures of children . You 'll see tomorrow night . The ducks are for a dinner . " The time in the tub was pure California , or at least I saw it that way , a California that had started well after I left the place . We were old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but until that morning when I had glimpsed Anne naked in the mirror I had seen neither of them withoutclothing . And fifteen years was n't really accurate at all , though there was something about that span of time that brought me at least comfort . I had known them actually for only four or so years , the ones when we had been together in college . For ten they had only come up a little in memory . But we were in middle age now , or close to it , and it was as if our friendship had grown and deepened in that time that we had no real contact at all . It was like a familyp88friendship , one in which the early cementing carried one through as a matter of time only . I knew them really very little at all , but I felt I knew them as well as I had known anyone , better than I had known Lorca , possibly even Anson . Had I not found them again , it would have been otherwise , imaginings of what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But their behavior , their hand movements and the sound of their voices , had enough in it of what I remembered to make me feel that the changes were unimportant . It was as if we had all been transported here , placed in this steaming tub , from a time in which we felt we knew each other . These were at least my feelings ; I had no real idea at all of theirs . They were familiar enough with me , but the gesturesand idiosyncrasies that I saw and remembered as terms of familiarity had a way now of effecting a kind of closing off of the present , a turning only back into the gone past . It was difficult to place our naked bodies together , there in the hot tub facing one another , in any way that I could find appropriate . They acted about it as if it were a common thing . I felt that whatever it was , it could not be that . I remembered the Bishop and his figure of the turning platform ; we sat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floated on the steamy surface of the water . Through the steam that rose into the cool night , I could see Carl 's face only a few feet away from me , but I could not place his presence behind the familiar mask of it . " Ah , " Carl said , and stretched his arms on the flat of the deck at the edge of the tub . The wet hair down the middle of his flat chest looked pubic . I could see the shape of Anne 's hips below the water 's surface . When her foot touched mine , I shifted and moved away . I attributed the whole event to a new California , to that stream of larger life in which they had swum for many years . " Oh , " Anne said , sinking her nipples below the surface , the dark hair in her armpits touching into the steam at the surface of hot water . She had her arms up on the edge like Carl . Perspiration streaked her cheeks and neck . I believedp89that I was grinning foolishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam . Carl lit a thin marijuana cigarette , drew at it , and passed it across the pool to me . I sucked deep at the smoke , welcoming it . There were drinks and ashtrays on the wood at the lip of the pool . " Mn , " Carl said , after he had exhaled , lifting the joint that I had returned to him and reaching it across to Anne . She shook her head slowly , refusing it , and he moved it back , drew at it again , then passed it over to me . We sat in the hot water and smoked ; the glasses and ashtrays at the pool 's edge became vibrant , and the steam rose up into an even blacker night . Carl mumbled something about pleasure . In a while I saw Anne 's arms stiffen , and then she lifted herself up into the thinning steam above us . " Enough for me , " she said , and I saw her breasts dip away from her as she climbed from the pool , then saw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A little longer for me , " Carl said , watching her as she lifted her robe up from the deck and slipped into it . When he turned his head from her , it was as if he were canceling her presence out entirely . He smiled at me through the mist . It was a strange smile , one without any quality at all that I could determine . " Okay ? " he said . " Okay , " I said , and watched the swing of Anne 's hips , the water dampening the robe over her buttocks as she walked away , down the deck and into the darkness at the door . Karla arrived in the late afternoon the following day . She brought two children with her , two little girls , and a box of slides and a projector . Coppie had stayed close to me most of the day , looking up into my face and speaking with quiet anticipation . Karla would bring the pictures and the girls ; they could all play in the yard with the animals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did arrive , he stayed even closer to me , almost walking on the sides of my shoes as I passed from room to room , watching Anne inp90the kitchen , going out to see Abbey feed the swans . Carl had gone into town to get the ducks before the three showed up , and Coppie and I found ourselves alone in a house full of women . This seemed to unnerve him a little . I felt his head brush my elbow , his hand always insistent along my hip and leg . And from the time we all arose in the early morning , Anne had been touching me too . It would be her hand on my shoulder as she pointed things out , her hip striking against me as she passed by , and while I was sitting and eating or drinking coffee , or sitting in a chair on the deck in the crisp air , I would feel her fingers at my neck and shoulders , her searching massage as she directed the children , telling Coppie to give me some room , Dana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl did not seem to like it that she was touching me , but he did n't speak of it . I caught his look though and the way his jaw tightened . If the touching bothered Coppie , I was unaware of it . He only moved closer to my side , pressing and running his cheek against my shirt . When the time came for Carl to go for the ducks , he asked me if I wanted to go with him , and for some reason , though Coppie 's insistence was beginning to get to me and I could have used the freedom from him , I decided to stay behind . Carl simply nodded and then left , and I think from then on some small place hardened between us . It was not that he did n't continue to reach out in conversation in that passive way of his , but that he absented himself from most talk of the past , wanting only to speak of what he was doing now or what he had done in the past that was separate from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience with Anne and his children . He spoke of climbing and skiing , his music collection , a little about his teaching . I was in the living room . I could hear the children in the yard beyond the kitchen . Coppie had left my side when he heard loud laughter coming from the girls . Anne and Karla were somewhere else in the house . It was good to be alone ,  |p91briefly  at least , and I looked at the primitive prints on the long living room wall and lifted and turned some of the pots and urns on the shelf below them . One of the pots had a hunchbacked flute player on its side . It seemed very old but was almost completely intact , just a few chips at the base and rim and the once-vivid paint almost all still there , though faded . When I lifted it , I heard a sharp click and froze with it in my hands , thinking for a moment that I had broken it . But then I shook it carefully and found that the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something , in the long curved handle , something loose in the hollow , placed there intentionally by its maker . The flute player sat on a large brown rock , hunched over , his hump like a bag with something alive in it carried high on his back , pushing against his neck . The flute was long but only half visible , remnants of fingers on the stops ; the player 's elbows stuck out and his head tilted a little as if he were listening to his own music . There were other figuresthat his playing seemed to send around the pot . They were vague now , but they looked like children or old men , or animals . They were dancing to the music , their movementsanimated and in a kind of slow frenzy . They were close together and some were touching or holding on to one another , but they did n't seem in any way geared to touchdancing . Each was in his or her own world , that world possessedand structured by the tooting . And the flute player seemed above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot 's surface . There were a few markings that looked like clouds and birds , and his head was up at a level with them . This made him a kind of god , a figure half in heaven . But his feet were on the ground to the rock 's side , his toes gnarled and clearly gripping at the earth . His loins were indistinct now , the paint worn away , and yet they could be guessed at as massive , muscular , and made for travel . He was naked , but the dancers wore garments , even the ones that might have been animals . The pebble or flint in the handle seemed a kind of joke or at least a surprise to make you laugh , it was so bright andp92sharp sounding , and it broke the concentrated yearning to hear the music of the flute itself , turning the pot to see the player and the dancers . The bottom of the handle was affixedclose to the flute player 's head , the other end in the birds and clouds at the rim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pebble would rattle and ascend , a music without clear rhyme or melody climbing from the flute player 's mouth up and into the vaguer air of another world . " He 's Kokopelli . " Her voice was soft , but it startled me ; I had been so concentrated in my study of the pot . Then Karla was at my elbow , looking down at the hunchbacked figure in my hands . " It 's an Anasazi piece , " she said . " Carl got it on one of his summer trips . He said around Yosemite , but I would n't count on that . " " All of these ? " I said , looking along the shelf . There must have been ten pieces at least that looked like the one I held , various shapes , but the same color to the clay , similar-looking figures . " I 'd have to think so . They 're seven hundred years old at least . The sites are mostly in Utah . " We heard the children'svoices rise up a little from the yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised her hand , interrupting our conversation , and turned and headed for the kitchen . She was tall and rather striking . In her worn and tightfittingjeans , her black satin shirt and paisley sash , she looked like one of the models I had spent time with when I was with Anson , and noting this I missed Anson for a reasonthat gave me discomfort , a slight pang of guilt . If she thought I had no interest in women in that certain way , I could get close to her , and I was missing Anson as a tool . She had beautiful dark hair , like Anne 's , but hers was fuller and had a wave to it . Her face was bold , with heavy features that I found out later came from a bit of Indian blood of a tribe I have forgotten . She moved like a model , had that slight slump , loose in the hips , and had a way of gesturing boldly with her hands and arms . Her daughters ,  |p93one  Coppie 's age and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gestures , and they were also dressed beyond their ages . Both wore tight pants , had their hair done in womanly ways , and wore the kinds of slightly baggy shirts that hinted that there might be the shapes of breasts beneath them . Once in the yard with the other children , they acted their ages , but in the house with their mother and Anne and I they slipped around objects and sat in chairs with the kind of careful conviction of adults . " And what do you do ? " Karla said . She was seated besideme on the couch , her legs crossed , a thin gold strap of her heeled sandal cutting across a thin ankle . Anne was in a chair across from us on the other side of the glass coffee table . We were drinking herbal tea . " I told you before , on the phone , remember ? Physiotherapy , like me , " Anne said . " Mostly massages now , " I said . " I could always use one of those , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was acting provocatively , but in a friendly and formal way . Still , her comment seemed inappropriate , too familiar , and I felt I was blushing slightly . If she saw this she did n't acknowledgeit , but moved gracefully into her next question . " Where 's Carl ? " " Out for the ducks , " Anne answered . " And you 're a photographer ? " I said . " Yes , " she said . " I take pictures of children . " She looked over at Anne . " Have you decided about it yet ? " " Not yet , " Anne said . " I 'm not really sure if the girls want to . " " Abbey is almost too old already . " " For what ? " I said . " For the kinds of pictures I 'm taking . " I looked up at a slight sound and saw Coppie standing to the side of the fireplace . He was grinning , leaning forward a little , arms to his sides , and his slight body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , " he said . " He 's got the ducks ! " Then he turned and rushed out of sight , and in a moment we heard a door slam in the distance . " Better go see , I guess , " Anne said , and the three of us rose and went to the small section of deck that ran along the kitchen end of the house . Carl had the ducks lined up beside each other on a redwoodtable , and all five of the children were gathered around so close that Carl had to elbow between them in order to make his preparations . The children were smiling and touching each other , but they were quiet , slightly intensein their interest in what was going to happen . There were six ducks , all plucked , and it was clear from the parchment color and texture of their skins and the slightly elongated shapes of their bodies that they had been hangingand drying somewhere for quite a while . Their webbed feet were still brightly yellow and white , and their eyes were closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had been lightly brushed with steel wool . On the deck beside the table was a tall cylindrical tank , painted bright red , with a complex system of valves and gauges at its top . Coppie was standing close to it , glancing at it occasionally , being careful not to touch it . The tank stood in a braced structure , a kind of miniature dolly with small rubberwheels at its four corners . On the deck beside the tank was a large pile of coiled tubing , plastic and rubber , in variousbright colors . Beside the bodies of the ducks on the tabletop was a small kit of some sort , a heavy plastic containerthe size of a cigar box . There was not enough room around the table for all of us , and Anne and I stood back a little , looking over the heads of the children . As Anne leaned forward , standing on her toes , she put her hand on my shoulder . " This is some business , " Karla said , her hand on the shoulders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the children laughed . Carl looked up , aware of their interestin the things that he was doing and was about to do . His expression was blank , but I noted what I thought was ap95certain intensity in the lines at the edges of his eyes . We were close around him and attentive , but he gave no sign at all that this pleased him . He stepped to the end of the table and rolled the tank a few feet away from it . Then he reached toward Coppie , not touching him , and urged him back and to the side . I realized that I had not seen him touch Coppie even once since my arrival . The tank turned slightly as it came to rest on its wheels , but I could see no marking of any kind to indicate what it might contain . Then Carl opened the small kit that sat beside the ducks and reached in and withdrew a ball of what looked like thin nylon twine and six long and blunt needles , each with a small shut-off valve attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Coppie looked up at him , startled , and then rushed into the kitchen . We could hear a clatter as a door slid open and then another . While we waited , Carl took the end of the twine from the ball and gathered the feet of the nearest duck in his hands ; then he looped the twine around the sticklike ankles and knotted it . When Coppie came back with the scissors , he cut the twine string , leaving a length of ten feet or so gathered in a loose circle on the table at the duck 's bound feet . He proceeded then to tie the legs of each of the ducks , leaving the same length of twine for each . While he fussed with the dead birds , I noticed that Abbey and Dana were getting restless . He was taking a long time , moving his hands in slow and methodical ways , and they were shifting from foot to foot , each glancing away from the table at times , watching birds and the slight wave of the trees . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . Karla 's girls might have been restless too , but they did not show it in a way that children usually did . The small one , Beth , stood with her hip slung out a little , her hand resting on it . She watched the table , but she seemed to be posing in some way . She would turn her head slightly , move her hand to adjust her hair or touch away some invisible speck from her cheek . She , like her sister Nina , had a smile on her face , butp96the smile was somehow inappropriate to the circumstances , not a smile of delight or interest but one of boredom , or bored seductiveness , or wistful memory of something intimateand private . They both seemed perfectly at ease where they were , as if they were not really there at all . When I looked down from their faces , I saw that Carl was finished with the tying and was beginning to insert the needles under their parchmentlike skins somewhere near their groins . Coppie flinched at each insertion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the table as he watched . After he had taped the needles in place , Carl went to the piles of colored tubing on the deck and brought six lengths of it back with him . Then , as he attached an end of a tube to each of the valves protruding from the ducks , he began to talk . His voice was soft but unhesitant . It was almost as if he were delivering a lecture of some sort . " Freeing the skin from the fatty layer beneath it can be done in various ways . The skin can be cut away with a knife , the fat then scraped free with some instrument . Or one can cook the duck using copious amounts of pepper to dissolve the fatty layer . Neither of these ways is the best way ; with both of them the skin can be damaged , making for an unattractive presentation at mealtime . The best way is with air , inflating the skin slightly , causing it to pull away from the fatty layer gradually and without any serioustrauma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good bet . I , however , like to use helium ; it 's lighter and makes for a cleaner job . " I glanced at Anne , whose smile was broad and fixed and slightly panicked , then at Karla , who I thought had not really been listening at all . She was watching her girls at the table across from us , measuring and judging their poses . " Daddy ! " Dana said in a frightened and slightly whining voice , and Carl looked up at her and smiled broadly in a vacant way.  | " Almost finished , dear , " he said . I would have thought he was speaking to Anne , his voice was so formal and adult , but he was looking a little to the side of Dana 's face . When each duck had its tube attached to it , Carl affixed the other ends of the tubes to the complex of valves and dials at the top of the cylinder . Then he asked each of us to take a duck , being careful as we carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and around the deck to its longer section that ran outside the glass wall of the living room . He gave these instructions very slowly , but with no falter in his voice at all , as if he had memorized them . There were eight of us , and only six ducks , and Anne and I stepped back from the table , letting the others lift them . The deck was broad , but there were a lot of us and the lengths of tubing and twine dripped and looped over most of the surface of the deck and up from it to the tank and ducks , and the going had to be very slow and careful . Carl was slightly ahead , pushing the tank , but he glanced back every few feet , checking for twists and warning us when he saw pending difficulties . The children stayed in front , Karla behind them , and Anne and I stayed as far to the side as possible , pressing against the outer railing of the deck as we moved along . Those carrying ducks had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the progress was unnatural enough so that they bumped into one another from time to time , shifting the ducks up or down in their hands as tubes and twine brushed against each other or against those on ducks carried beside them . There were brief outcries of exclamation , quick words of warning , and these were mixed with Carl 's measured instructions and guidance . Karla and Carl seemed equally uncomfortable with the slowness of the pace , and the slight jostling of the children had a way of forcing them to walk like children too , their steps abbreviated , their torsos tight , and their arms moving almost in adolescent gesture . Even their faces looked a little childlike , their lips pursed and their eyes bright and moist . Karla 's children no longer moved likep98models , and even Anne and I , though to the side and slightly disengaged from the progress , stepped awkwardly , our fingers running along the railing 's surface . In a very long time we reached the turn of the deck and made our way down the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of that length Carl instructed Karla and the children to spread out at equal intervals and place the ducks on the railing of the deck . This too had to be done with care , making sure that tubes were not tangled . When the ducks were in place , the duck carriers stepped back from them , lifting their feet from the coils of tubes and the hanging twine , until they had made their way to the glass wall of the living room . Then as we watched him Carl set to work with the final steps in the process . The bodies of the ducks rested on the railing , a good five feet between them , their heads hanging from their limp necks visible on the far side and on ours their yellow , webbed feet . There was about the same distance between us as well , where we stood in a row with our backs to the sliding glass doors that formed the long wall of the living room . Only Coppie was out of order . He stood tight against me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it like a handle , his head cocked to the side , pressing into my hip . When I looked down into his hair , I saw he was watching Carl . He was shivering slightly ; I could feel his body vibrate along my leg . When I looked to each side and down the line , I saw that the rest , except for Anne , were watching Carl as well . Anne was watching me and Coppie , and I thought I saw something slightly desperate in her look . Then I heard the hammer , and when I looked back I saw Carl raising it and bringing it down . He was tacking the terminal ends of the twine attached to the duck 's ankles into the top of the railing . The tacks were small , and after he had started them he wound the ends of the twine around them under their heads , then drove them in . When he had finished with this he moved back to the cylinder in its dolly and adjusted it , tracing each tube that ran from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making sure that each tube was free of the others . Then he turned to each duck and opened the shut-off valves attached to the needles . When he had checked the last duck in the line , he turned toward us and smiled . " This is it , " he said , and then he returned to the cylinder , his back to us . I saw him bend down over the system of cylinder , tubes and gauges , then saw in the way his back tightened and shifted that he was making adjustments . When he was finishedhe rose up a little to the side of the cylinder and stood erect , his left hand resting on the metal knob at its top . Then he slowly turned the knob , and I could hear the beginningrush of the gas as it flowed into the tubing . In the first moments the ducks remained the same , limp and flattened and hanging over the sides of the railing , though the tubes began to writhe and stiffen along the deck 's surface . Then I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one their heads began to come to the horizontal in the air , their necks thickening . One at the far end began to rock then and roll slightly from side to side as its body swelled to an oval . In a moment , all the ducks were rocking . I felt Coppie press tight into my hip and watched the ducks come up , their limp ankles dragging along the railing until they seemed to be standing , their yellow , webbed feet doing an awkward tap on the wood . Then they were in the air , their dangling feet inches above the railing . They rose up , not quite in unison , until each reached the end of its tether , the thin nylon line tacked into the wood , and as they reached that terminus and the line snapped taut they bounced a little and drifted to either side , their feet kicking , their heads rotating on their stiff , inflated necks . They moved toward each other in their drifts , but they did not reach each other . Their heads turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact , and then rotated back to look at a place above us over the roof and into the sky . Then they began to settle in their bobbing . They looked like nothing but inflated ducks , plucked oval animals , as thep100late-afternoon breeze pushed them against their lines , their beaks lifting and scenting , their webbed feet bound and touching where they hung , standing in the air , against the sky and clouds . " Kip and Banyon ? " Her voice came muffled out of the blanket and the edge of the pillow against which she had pushed her face . It was dark now , only the light of a candle illuminating her body and the white towel that crossed over her hips , covering her buttocks , where she lay on her stomach under my hands . I could see a duck bobbing through the high windowof Anne 's bedroom . The deck was illuminated with spots , and the ducks had been drifting there in clear view throughout the late afternoon and evening . I knew that the backyard had lights as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animals . We had sat with them , watching them eat their early dinner , and I could hear the faint sounds of Anne in the kitchen , the clack of dishes and silver . I was n't sure where Carl was . I worked her lower back and the backs of her thighs ; that 's what she had asked for . The oil I used was a mix of clarified animal fats , scented with a perfume that smelled vaguely oriental , very subtle , but tart as it heated in the friction and came through . Her words were mixed with moans as I held her waist in my hands , then pressed my thumbs in toward her spine . We would see her slides in a while , and then the children would go to bed and we would eat our dinner on our laps in the living room , cold leftover salmon with mayonnaise , and would drink tequila . In the beginning she thought I had more in mind than the rubbing , and when I came into the room to find her alreadyundressed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body was tense , the muscles in her shoulders and legs visibly bunched . She had shaken her hair out to cover all of her head , and I could see nothing of her face and features . But now she had swept her hair back . Her ear and cheek were visible , and I knew where her mouth was and couldp101see the edge of her brow . I had touched the creases below her buttocks , had run my fingers close to the cleft , and when I had done nothing but that , had pressed her only for her deep comfort there , she had relaxed and spread her legs slightly and given in with trust . Now she was talking . " Kip and Banyon ? " She seemed reluctant to start at first , as if her embarkation would take her to places she would rather not arrive at , to things of unpleasantmemory . I kept pressing into her , and before long her faltering ceased and she was telling me details . " Kip and Banyon were here earlier , at different times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . I think they were each here for a year or so . It was before I came . Maybe I was here at the end of Kip 's stay ; I 'm not sure . There 's talk among some in the town still , I know , but because of what I do with my pictures nobody talks to me about it , or about most anything , for that matter . I 'm sure I 'm talked about as well . This is a small town , very tight and conservative . A woman without a husband , doing what I do , well , it 's no wonder . " Banyon was the first of the two . And I think he had known them vaguely from somewhere , had known Carl at least , and he came for a brief visit and stayed a whole year . Then , when he left , it was Kip , I guess in the same circumstances . Both were about the same age as Carl and Anne . In the town they thought it was a menage both times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kip was a carpenter or handyman of some kind . I believe I recall seeing him in the town once when I first got here . He looked like a drifter , was silent and guarded , a little frail and wild-looking . " I thought of Anson as she described her recollection of Kip , and pressed , almost involuntarily , close to her crotch , sexually close to it . But she only grunted softly and moaned and opened her legs a little more . I had her trust and I did not further abuse it . " Not a menage because I came across them , together with Carl , in Yosemite about three summers ago . That was a strange coincidence . I was there taking pictures for ap102travel mag . I hardly knew Carl and Anne at all then , had only met and talked to them briefly at some art opening here in the town . I recognized him at a distance though . He was with the other two , outside , somewhere in the park itself , and he was touching both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other two had been swishing a little , but they stopped that when he saw me and talked to them . It came to me very quick that they were sleeping together and that they had probably been doing that when the two were here in Sharonville . I knew right away that the one was Kip , and guessed that the other was Banyon . They had a girl with them . " Luna was her name . She was about seven years old , very thin , and a little awkward , I thought  --  serious and formal when they introduced us . They all seemed to be keeping an eye on her . One of them always went with her when she moved away , went to look at a tree or rock or some tourists moving along the paths . Carl did n't have much to say , but the other two were effusive . He told me that he came here most every summer . The three of them climbed those large rock pillars in the park . Anne was n't along this trip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were his children . " I had a hat and scarf , some sunglasses and some other things in my bag , the kinds of things I always carried when I was out shooting , in case I ran across a kid I wanted to shoot . I 'd been doing kids for a while already then , and I asked if I could shoot Luna . " I do n't think Carl liked the idea at all . But things were touchy , tentative I thought among the four of them , as if they were out together for the first time in this grouping , and Kip and Banyon seemed to get a kick out of the idea , and Carl stopped after a few beginning objections . I got a couple shots of the girl sitting on a rock , pretty good ones as it turned out . I think I 've got them with me . " And that 's about all of it , I guess . I took the pictures of the girl , we all had a Coke together , and then we said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've never spoken of it to Anne . Really , we 're just casual friends . The kids go to the same school . She 's shown some interest in my photographs . We do n't socialize much at all , just when the kids get together . Carl acknowledged our meeting only once , in front of Anne . He did n't mention the other two or the girl , and I got it that he wanted to close the subject off once and for all by noting it . " " What about those pots in the living room ? " I said softly . I was moving my hands over her left scapula , feeling the edges of her trapezius , working in toward her upper thorax . I had leaned down over her , and my mouth was close to her ear . I felt her breath against my lips when she answered , smelled something fruity . " Nothing about that , " she whispered . " But they do n't come from Yosemite . You can bet on that for sure . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materialized for me in the way I imagined a character developing and then becoming fixed for an author writing a novel . He too now seemed to be who he was , and not that memory of him that I had held vaguely for many years . And what he now was made me question my memory of him in the past entirely . Perhaps there had been some inkling of the base of his character for me then , but search my thoughts of him as I might I could not find it . And I did not think , either , that he had changed , that he was fundamentally different from the Carl I had known then . I could only think that I had not really known him at all . We had sat with the children while they ate , and I had seen him watch their mouths move , their fingers tear the flesh of the chicken from the bone . Not one of them alone would have appeared ravenous at the trough , but together , and in the fact that there was no clatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or flavor to divert us , the sounds and sights of their feeding was almost frightening inp104its energetic , desperate insistence . Even Karla 's girls , Beth and Nina , had abandoned their veneer of sophistication . Wisps of their hair hung , disheveled , from their pins and combs , they had milk mustaches , and their silk shirts were stained with grease . Karla and Anne were talking across the table as the childrenate , but Carl was watching them , and I watched Carl . He had a faint smile on his face , and I took it that he was finding some satisfaction in what he saw as their gluttonous pleasure . But I did n't think it was that . It was more desperate , more needful , as if eating were their only sure place of satisfaction , temporary and fleeting . Even Coppie was drawn into the feeding . His eyes closed as he swallowed , forcing the half-chewed gobbets down his throat . I do n't think he was hungry , but was only reaching for the momentarysafety that the others seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from their plates , pieces of flesh in their teeth , their cheeks smeared with fat , and they would look at the ducks bobbing in the air through the glass wall . It was twilight , and the ducks were aglow in the wash of the low sun . The light had tricked their eyes into opening ; they were small glittering stones now above their burnished bills . But Carl never looked at the ducks . He had his chair slightly back from the table . He was no longer the center of attention he had been while stringing the ducks up . The children ate and ignored him . The women looked at each other and talked . Anne 's eyes went to the children at times , but I could see no surprise or outrage in them , rather a deep , sad resignation , as if she recognized this as their only real solace and bore it because of that in silence . I watched Carl , but he did not know this . His mouth was moving , and at first I thought he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chewing . But then I saw that the timing was all wrong and that he was talking , rehearsingsomething , silently shaping words . When he paused and nodded and pursed his lips and then moved his mouth again , I saw it was a conversation . When I saw his eyesp105focus , I realized that he was talking to someone no more than a foot from his face . When the children 's meal was finished , Karla began to set up her projector and arrange her slides in the carousel on the now-cleared dining table . Rather than turn the lights on the deck off , Carl pulled the thick drapes across the wall of windows , closing off our vision of the floating ducks . The children were left to play while Karla was getting ready , and Anne took down the print that hung on the wall at the end of the dining room , providing a screen . I had no idea of what to expect from the slides , but I did know that it involved pictures of children and that there was some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be involved in it . Beth and Nina had acted blase about the showing , but Dana and Abbey had brought the subject of the pictures up from time to time . Coppie would step aside when the pictures were mentioned , look away , or interrupt , urging another subject entirely . He would pull at my sleeve or lean against me , as if he wanted to keep me away from the slides as well . This all seemed odd because of his excited anticipation of Karla 's coming earlier on . I did n't know what to make of it . When the white square on the wall was adjusted to a proper height and focus , Carl went to the yard and called the children in . The girls gathered around the table and found seats . Anne sat down as well , and so did I. Coppie stood at the side of my chair , his head brushing from time to time at my shoulder , and Carl moved to the light switch on the wall . The room went dark , and Karla clicked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman sitting in a white wicker chair in a yard , under a large flowering tree . She was at a distance , and her features were not clear . She was dressed in a billowing flowered dress that fell to her feet ; she had a large feathered hat on her head , and over her shoulder a small parasol . Her left arm was raised , holding what looked like a long cigarette up to her mouth . Her legs werep106crossed , and her black patent leather shoes were visible at the hem of her dress . There was a massive car parked beyond the fence of the yard , a good distance on the other side of the tree . " That 's Beth ! " Dana said . " Of course it is ! You 've seen this before , silly , " Abbey said in the darkness . It was indeed Beth . When I knew it , the size of the car gave it away . It was not gigantic at all . It was the tree , the chair , and the figure that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car was normal . " It was something with distance and scale I was trying , " Karla said from above us where she stood at the projector . " I thought the car was interesting . " There was a click , and another slide appeared . This and the next few were of Beth and Nina together . They were photographs of the children in dress up clothing : dresses that trailed behind them ; women 's high-heeled shoes , in which their feet were swallowed up ; hats sliding down to their ears ; even fur pieces draped to their waists . And strings of artificial pearls and long , looping earrings . In each they wore makeup , too much of it , applied in a childlikeway . They were standing in bedrooms , on porches , and out in yards . They were not posing , but seemed to have been caught candidly in their play . Still , there was a slight hint of staginess in the pictures , and it was clear that they were dressed for the occasion of them . Karla commented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat vaguely of the girls becoming women by putting on their garments . Coppie grew restless as she spoke , and I felt his hand running very lightly over my shoulder and along my arm . He was making little sounds in his throat , something between swallows and breaths . Then the clothing in the photographs became tailored to the children 's size , the dresses and shoes began to fit , and pieces of lingerie replaced blouses and skirts . They began to appear in bedrooms exclusively , lounging in beds or inp107armoires , half dressed and strangely provocative , the bright , clear eyes of their childhood betrayed by postures and what I took to be instruction in looks , head tilts and makeup . They gazed out from under carefully arranged hair . Their eyes lowered to reveal light rose and blue on their lids . Their wet lips were moistened now with lipstick rather than the animal fat that I had seen on them at the table earlier . They would have been women but for the fact that in every picture there was an object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were children . " It is all intentional , " Karla said , softly and seriously . " Yes , I can see that , " Anne said without expression . Nobody laughed or pointed . Beth and Nina spoke somewhatarchly , in the way the models had spoken to me when I was with Anson , about poses and lighting . Karla hummed her approval . " Do you want to do that ? " Anne said in the darkness . " I do n't know , " Dana said , and Coppie said " No " at the same time . Abbey laughed at that , but her laugh was tentative and quickly cut off . I heard Carl shift his weight and grunt quietly in the distance behind us . " Look at this one , " Karla said , and clicked another slide into view . It was a photograph of a large bathroom with a large lounging chair in the middle of it on a wine-colored carpet . The chair was tan and covered in cut velvet . To the left in the background , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a dressing table covered with bottles of perfume , ointments and powders in various crystal containers . They were reflected in the mirror above the table , appearing in such abundance that they suggested a kind of surfeit . Both Beth and Nina were in the chair , and on the floor besidethem there was a green teddy bear , with green , sparklingeyes , sitting with his legs spread and his arms gathered across his chest . The two girls were dressed only in silk teddies , one black and one red , with matching high-heeled shoes . They both wore earrings and each had stringsp108of fake pearls and other beads , long rows hanging to their hips . Their legs were pulled up in the chair , and Nina had her arm around Beth 's shoulder . She was leaning into her , her arm across her body , her hand resting on Beth 's knee . They both had their hair pulled tightly up and piled on their heads , affixed there with bone combs and jeweled stickpins . Their makeup matched their garments , red and black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of red bubble gum , I thought . They were both smiling innocently . On Beth 's shoulder , to the side of the strap of her teddy , there was a black speck on her alabaster skin , a large fly , its wings slightly elevated , luminous and translucent , even the wires of its legs , pressing small indentations in the soft white turn of her shoulder , clearly visible . Karla went on with the slides , and I began to feel my eyes begin to ache from the sight of them . The girls remainedquiet , intensely interested in what they were seeing . I would forget that Coppie was at my shoulder , but then I would feel his touch again and remember him . Near the end , a slide came up that was different from the others , less polished in technique , hastier in setting . I heard Carl shift in his chair behind me when it appeared . " Who 's that ? " Coppie said , his voice dry and raspy at my shoulder . " Somebody I shot a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girl sat on a large rock in an open place . There were trees in the distance behind her , but none close enough to give shade . She had a large floppy hat on , and she held a pair of what looked like fancy rhinestone-studded sunglassesin her fist across her chest . The hand that held the glasses and the whole arm were slightly hazy in focus , and I guessed she had snatched the glasses off a fraction before the shutter closed . The hat was tilted back on her head , not as it should have been worn , and the whole of her thin face and forehead were visible in the frame . The palm of her other hand rested flat on the rock to the side of her worn jeans . She wore sad little blue strapped sandals , cheap andp109frayed , and her toenails were torn down to the quick . Her shirt was a drab check , and strands of her bone-white hair stuck out from under the hat , brushing her shoulders . She was about seven years old . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling across the ground in front of her , more than one , but I could tell that she was not looking at the source of them . Her eyes went directly into the lens , into the dining room where we were sitting , into our eyes , and the look was powerful in its focused vacancy . She was not looking at us , but through us , not into us in a visionary way , but through to a world of total inaction and mistrust , a world in which there was no single thing to be measured against another for value . I thought it must be a gray world , one that could offer nothing . Worse was the resignation . Her look and posture , the empty defiance of the snatched-off sunglasses , her mutilatednails , her palm on the rock without function , her hair that seemed drained of color , and those blasted and washed-out hazel eyes , all gathered into an image that was beyond despair . There was nothing any more of the past in her . I could not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ducks floated , straight in the air from their tethers now . There was no breeze , and though they rotated to face each other and look in on us , they were no longer drifting to the side at all . Some were higher than others . It was a staggered line , and as I looked out the glass wall at them , I saw that the lower ones had deflated slightly , and that the twine tacked to the deck railing below each of them was no longer taut in the air , but was hanging in limp loops . Carl saw it too . " The skin 's leaking a bit . That 's good , " he said . " The pores are opening , " and he pushed himself to his feet and went out one of the sliding doors to the deck . I saw him go to the cylinder and reach for the valve at the top . Then the ducks slowly rose again , until the linesp110were taut and each floated at the same level , bobbing slightly when they reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their webbed feet settling , only the black sky now behind them , the trees invisible on this moonless night . I watched them , and even after Carl had come back in and seated himself again , I kept watching them . I was avoiding Karla 's look , which I felt was on me . Anne was sitting next to her on the couch , and I was in a chair across from them , low mugs of tequila over ice on the glass coffee table between us . Carl sat in another chair , faced so that he could look at all of us and see the ducks from the corner of his eye at the same time . The children were in bed now . It was close to ten . The cold salmon sat in a dish with plates and silver beside it on the tea caddy that Anne had rolled in . I could smell the hot bread in the straw basket beside the platter . " You know , it 's really Coppie I 'd like to photograph , " Karla said . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fat chance , " he said . " I did n't think so , " Karla said . " It would be interesting though . " Anne got up and began serving the salmon . " They 'll be ready by tomorrow morning , " Carl said , looking out at the ducks . Their bodies were fully oval again , smooth in their inflation . " Did you know that Lorca stole clothing from the store ? " Anne said . " Who 's Lorca ? " Karla said . " His first wife . " Calling her that rung hollow . There was no second , at least not yet . I had no idea what she was trying to get at . " I knew that , " I said . " She took colorful things , after that woman had been there , the old one , casual western wear , bright knits and paisleys . " Anne shifted in her chair , handing the basket of hot bread across to me . Her eyes were bright with the in/formation , but the shape of her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wondering where she might have hidden them . " How much ? " I said . " Oh , a lot ! " she said . " I guess a whole wardrobe , you could say . It was just before we left L.A. though , and I never saw them . I 'm not sure about it all . You know , it was shocking , and we were leaving . She sent me one letter after that , but she did n't mention them . It was an odd letter . " I knew about two dresses only . " What was odd about it ? " I said . " Well , I do n't know ; it was very vague . There were no details in it at all . Not a bit like Lorca . " " What was she like ? " Karla said . Her question hurt my eyes in its quick inappropriateness , all the more since she addressed it to Anne . I thought I had then a hint of the flavor of what I found wrong about her photography . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of the situation . " Hair the color of that wine rug in your pictures , " Carl said . I looked sharply at him , but he was looking at the wall across the room , his eyes unfocused . Her hair had not been that color . It was black , like Anne 's , but I thought he was sure about what he said , though he was wrong . I had the mug of tequila at my lips , and over it I could see Carl rolling a marijuana cigarette on a sheet of yellow paper on the coffee table . I hesitated to drink . Dinner had been quick and perfunctory . Carl lit the joint and drew deeply at it , then handed it to me . I put the mug down , took it and drew at it , then reached it across to Karla , letting the smoke stream out of my lungs . We were through with talk about Lorca and the stolen clothing now . There was some brief talk about Karla 's pictures , talk in which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl turned in his chair and checked the ducks . I could see that two of them were lowering again.  | " I 'll give them a few minutes , " he said , speaking to himself . " Too much with the ducks ! " Karla said , and she and I laughed , Anne joining in , leaning back in her chair and looking over at my shoulders and at my neck . She licked her lips , her tongue like a bright pink arrow . " Ooo , this is powerful ! " she said . " It is that , " Carl said . I saw Anne was drifting in her high . She was looking along my shoulders and arms , studying my clavicle , my chest . Her lips were moist and her eyes wide and swimminga little . " The ducks , " Carl said . I heard the words completely formed in my head , audible , before they entered the space between us . They bounced a little when he spoke them , and I turned my head past Karla and Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two in the middle were no more than a foot from the railing now , and the slight movement of their feet suggested that they were reaching down , like parachutists , searching for a foothold in landing . I watched the loops in the twine and had to pull my head away with the muscles in the side of my neck to avoid gettingfixed in gazing . Anne was already talking , gesturing , and I came back to her in midsentence. " ... what she did . And it was preparatory for some change or leaving . She backed off from our friendship . Something about painting . " " Lorca again ? " I said , and Anne looked at me . Then her eyes lost focus and she grinned , losing the train . I felt Carl rise to his feet , and when I turned I saw he was heading to the glass wall , a little stiff-legged . He went out a sliding door and moved to the tank . The ducks shot up in the air , their tethers quivering , and bobbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll send them to outer space ! " Karla said . Then Carl came back in , took the bottle of tequila from the glass table , and filled all our mugs . " How about a tub ? " he said , his words a little too loud inp113the temporary silence in the room . Anne was on her feet and heading for my chair , and when I looked across at Karla I saw she was slumped , her head on the back of the couch , her eyes gazing up into the beams of the ceiling . No one responded to what Carl had said , and he sat down carefully in his chair and crossed his arms . Anne circled behind my chair . I saw her hand touch the back of it at my head , then felt the tips of her fingers at my shirt collar , then at my neck , a drag of nail below my ear . " Sure , " she said . " In a few minutes . " " Sure , " Karla said , her voice rising above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thumbs press into the muscles at the base of my neck , smelled a perfume from the distant past , and heard something deep , moist , and despairing in her throat . The steam rose in a thick , perfect cylinder from the hole in the far end of the deck , thinning and then dissipating into the black night well above our heads . It was cool , and when I removed my pants I felt the pleasant bite of it high on the backs of my thighs . My groin dampened immediately as I faced the tub . I could see the two women , ghostly , through the steam , and then the curves of their naked bodies , neuter and unformed , as they stretched and moved and lowered themselves into the hot water . Carl was already in up to his neck , his head bobbing in the mist at my feet . I stepped down and in then , the water like a hot wire wound around each leg and ascending as I went in . The tub was small , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groin entered , my legs struck against other legs , which shifted away or pressed into my own as I sat . Then I was in up to my chest , and settled . I was still high , but the shock of the air and then of the water had brought me back a little , and I wanted to talk . I felt there was more to say , more to find out and get clear between us . But the mist , though I could see through it slightly now , could see the three heads beside and beyond me , swallowed up the words that were spoken , each sen/tence seeming to end in a slight moan , and conversation was impossible . I picked out the words Lorca and ducks and thought I heard Kip once , but I could n't be sure if it was a name or a click in somebody 's throat or a slap of small waves against the wood . I slipped deeper into the water , feeling the ripplesagainst my chin , and thought of my head like a duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across from me were . Karla said something I could not make out at all , but it sounded like an invitation . It had a warble in it and a seriouslaugh . I think Carl spoke , but the steam confused directionand timbre . I know Anne laughed in that strangely despairing way that I had come to hear from her often since my arrival . I recognized her hand on my own on the tub side . And then all movement and talk ceased . I felt a knee hit against my own , but it moved away . I put my head back and gazed up into the steam . I thought I could see the hard blackness above me . I had no idea whose leg had touched me . The heat of the water had deadened my senses . But my arms were alive . I could feel the wood along the decking beside the pool . I took what I thought was Anne 's hand and held it . My head was free of my body , and I was glad for the dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my staying and leaving , so it was that Anson had finally reached out to me in his final weeks . " You 're leaving , " Coppie said . " You 'll miss the ducks . " And before I could answer he was on his feet and beyond the room , something of Anson 's tone and weakness left in the air behind him . " He always does that , " Abbey said , " leaves before you can talk . " In the tub we had drifted into a kind of somnolence . My part had been to make no move , and the leg that touched my own had soon enough moved away . It grew too hot in a while , and one by one , like dreamers , we had lifted our bodies up in the rising steam , then shivered against the cold on the decking above the tub . Before I rose in the morning , Karla and her children hadp116departed , and when I moved to the breakfast table I saw through the wall of windows that the ducks were gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a morning 's work , preparing the ski slopes beyond the town in anticipation of the winter snow and activity there , though it was more than six months away . Anne said he would be back by afternoon , but I told her I found I could n't wait , that I would have to be heading south . I embraced her at the door and asked her to say my good-byes to Carl . The girls had hugged me and then gone somewhere in the house , but over Anne 's shoulder as I held her , I could see Coppie standing beside the fireplace . He was watching intently . " You do n't approve of the pictures , do you ? " Anne said into my neck . " No , " I said . " I 'd keep the girls away from her . " I felt her head move against my cheek . And then she said that she had not said all there was about Lorca . There was more at least of the flavor of it , maybe some hints about what had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought we could have gotten closer to the mystery , things about the way she was in those last days before they left . " Maybe so , " I said . " What about Kip and Banyon ? " " That 's no mystery at all . You can see it in Coppie . Andthe girls too . But we do n't speak of it . I ca n't yet . " " And the girl in the photograph ? " I said . " What abouther ? " " I never saw that one before , but I think that ripped it for me . I wo n't let the girls get involved with her . I do n't think they really want to anyway . " I did n't persist . She seemed to know nothing of what Karla had told me about Yosemite , and when she released me and I could see her face again , I saw that her eyes and lips were moist and that she wanted something else before I left . I 'd given her Melchior 's New York address , telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no other place that was home for me just then , but I 'd felt a need to keepp117in touch , have a place that she could reach me at least . I 'd given it to her privately , while Carl was out of the house . I had n't checked it with Melchior before leaving . I 'd kept a box number in the city , but I did n't figure to be checking it for a long time . " What is it ? " I said . " I do n't know . I 've been moving around it for years , I think . Carl and I. It 's mostly the kids . You saw the way they ate ? Mostly it 's Coppie , that nervousness . None of this is good for them . It 's not good for me either . " " I 'm sorry , " I said . " What will you do ? " " Oh , I do n't know . I do n't know what to do . " " Would money make any difference ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No . Nothing like that . You see this place . Carl gets whatever 's needed . I do n't know how . " " Maybe it 's those pots ? " " Maybe it is , " she said . " He tells me nothing . " As if he could hear our interchange , Coppie moved from the fireplace and came out to the door . We were standing apart when he got to us , holding each other 's hands . He did n't say anything , but I felt his arms gather around my waist , his head press into my hip . He held fast , but only protested slightly with his grip when , after a few long moments , Anne reached down and pulled his arms away from where he held me . He just stood back then and looked up at me , and there was something in his face or posture or in the still mechanics of his hips and shoulders that reminded me of Anson . It was well after the winter , the early morning after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when I woke the windows were glazed over . Anson slept in the cot besidemy bed now , and when I rose to the narrow space between us , I felt his hand at my thigh , his fingers tugging weakly at my pajamas . I looked down at him , his sunken face and the slight protruding of his nose . He was so thin that it was hard to find the configurations of his bodyp118among the crumpled sheet folds and tucks of blanket . But his eyes were still clear and bright . " Get in here with me , will you ? " His voice was raspy and without verve . And then I had him in my arms in the narrow cot . It groaned as he did as I lowered my weight down beside him . His knees touched my knee and his thin chest was like a fragile bird 's nest against my own . We said nothing , and he did not weep for anything in his life . I gave him what I could , which was holding him . I could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some way silently , when he sighed and pressed his face into my shoulder I knew that it was not for nothing . This was the first time , I think , that I had ever touched him . Oh , beyond massage , a handshake , or a brief embrace of greeting . It was too late , I knew , for what it might have been , and I knew too that the might have been was never really a possibility . Knew then , I think , that it had probably never been possiblewith Lorca either . And then it was I who wept a little , a thing Anson mistook and about which I did not disabuse him ; it gave him some comfort . In the beginnings of that last year , Anson 's illness was not apparent to others . The social gatherings and the work went on , and though his weight began to slip and his clothingloosened , most took it as a change in style , and I think I noted that there were other young men , those fresh from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I would see them at parties , lingering at respectful distances , their collarsresting away from their necks , their pants a little baggy at the knees . The women , I think , sensed it ; their looks grew curious and unsettled , and they came to both of us when we were standing alone , came in pairs and stood closer to us than they had before . Their health seemed more robust when they gathered around Anson , and his wit and energy seemed stirred by this , so that their groupingwas always animated , the women leaning close to Anson , touching him on arm , shoulder and cheek , as he spoke and made them laugh.  |p119The  other men , his business acquaintances and friends , noticed nothing . Anson was doing new and marvelous things with his designs , drawing dresses that were thought of as something on the brink of the new in the industry , and the men seemed hungry for his secret , exhilarated to be in his company . Anson drew in the mornings , napped in the afternoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social events . I took him to doctors , but all they could speak about was infection . They gave him antibiotics , but he had reactions . They said massages would n't hurt , but they began to pain him a little when I pressed too hard , and after them he was exhausted , and so I limited myself to few and only those in which I used my palms superficially . Anson ceased to talk under them . He would fall asleep halfway through . I persisted beyond the point at which I should have stopped , beginning to realize too late , and desperately , that there were things he might have told me earlier on had I pressed him . I had no idea what these things might be , but as I felt the coming closure of our time together , I recognized the ten years of it as something that I really did not understand . We had been young in our joining , young men sharinga bachelor pad , two youths in a period of moratorium , and that was fine . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no conventional device left to justify our bonding . We had moved in view of middle age together , almost there , and I felt that not to understand the years between us was to in some way have wasted them . And so I tried to push the words from him , going on too long , until sadly he had to tell me . And when he told me , his face and voice muffled by the towel , I knew from the half-despairing tone in his voice that the rubbing had been some kind of surrogate , for him at least , and that he knew that I did not understand this but might when he spoke of its ending . And I did understand it , but I think now that our use of it was different , mine more complex than his , deeper and having more to do with fundamental things , a mire below the physical . But I am not absolutelyp120sure of this , of Anson 's feel in the feeling of being massaged . One morning , Anson asked me to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small pearl at the end of it . " It presses into my lobe when I sleep ; I think it wakes me . " Where did you get it ? " I said . " I think you said it was California ? " He was sitting on the edge of his cot , swallowed in his pajamas , his arms resting on his knees , his thinning hair sticking up in twisted spikes . " No , " he said . " It was Utah . " I got some alcohol and a cotton swab and sat on the cot beside him . When I lifted his lobe , I could see a crusty substance in the loop of the fastener . I twisted it carefully on the post , and the crust broke and fell in tiny bits to his leg . " It was no place to get an earring in those days . I mean you could n't go into some jewelry store and get it done , a boy could n't . But there was a place outside of town , a woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think there were stories too about abortions being done there . It was no hangout , just a house , and a middle-aged woman . She did it with a needle she held under a match . I remember I thought her clothes were strange , leather and a lot of emblems and chains and such . It did n't hurt much , and I bought the earring from her . But this is n't the one . I got this one from Maudie . " The fastener came away easily , but when I pulled the post out it was moist with a clear liquid . Then I swabbed both sides of his lobe with alcohol . " Utah , " he said . " Maybe I should have stayed there . " " Not a chance , " I said , and touched his shoulder and shook him lightly . He lifted his head then and smiled wanly up at me . The bitter winter faded and the first tight buds of spring began to push their delicate colors from their encapsulated husks . And with the slowly rising temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those days , the fall lines passed from Anson 's renderings into first cuttings and pinnings , crude and primitive joinings of fabric that were like premature births , featureless but with promise , like the first growth of spring . Anson removed little of what he had worn in winter , and I remembered him standing in his open overcoat watching a model who had her side to him . Only that one side of her was draped in heavy patches that when sewn together would be a fall cape . Her other shoulder was dressed in cotton , bright colors , vertical stripes falling in many pleats to her knee ; she wore sneakers and her legs were bare . It was too warm in the room , and there was perspiration on her brow . Anson , however , was shivering , and he pulled his heavy coat closed , gripping it in his fist in front of him , as he moved around her , making suggestions . She was clearly uncomfortable in the weight of the heavy fabric , but I saw her watching him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knitted her brow . Summer came , and the men who came to parties in that season wore appropriate and gay clothing that was no term of sexual preference in those days but a matter only of style . Barney , a bright and measured model who had a taste for his female counterparts , stood awkwardly in flowing shirts and pocketless pants . He told me he preferred the winter tweeds , cordovans , and flannel . He had a chiseled face , and though he might have been a friend I could n't bring myself to press the truth about Anson and me . Most of the other men , designers and models , wore those feminineclothes called unisex with a certain flair and comfort . Only Anson and I were different , I in the casual and nondescriptclothing that still hinted of California , Anson only slowly unpeeling , still in sleeveless sweaters that had grown baggy , heavy cotton shirts , and wool socks . Along with the sap of the new season there was fluid coming from Anson in places other than his ear , small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corners of his eyes . He had little vanity , but hep122kept a small mirror on the table beside his cot , and in the mornings he would carefully clean his face with cream and tissue , and I would help him swab the small eruptions on his neck and chest . He took to wearing makeup , a light blush , and once he asked me to buy him smaller clothes , a few shirts and trousers . I did that , but in a week he had recededeven further , shrinking beneath them . And then the last weeks came , and in them I began to feel as if I were his husband , an incompetent and bewilderedman with a dying wife , one who pulls himself togethereach morning and manages . I would rise into sounds of his stertorous breathing , see the night 's drainings near his carotid pulse and clavical . I would move to the kitchen carefully and with my head hanging . Not to wake him . Slow with the coffee and the click of metal . And when the sun entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note the groan of bed and body , measure his sighs and movements against the previous day 's . I would look at the stacks of plates , saucers and cups , the shapes of shakers and colanders , implements hung on hooks . Everything began to look different , poignant with history . Then I would go into the bedroom and tend him . Early on , we went for brief walks as the weather warmed . There was a park a block away , and Anson would lean lightly on my arm . We crossed only when the street was empty of cars , and we would sit for a few minutes on a park bench , listening to the birds and watching the traffic . On the way back home , I 'd stop for brioche and yogurt , and we would eat it in the kitchen , with a cup of fresh coffee . Then Anson , when he was up to it , would work a while on his drawings . In the late morning and early afternoon he 'd nap , and he would be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had found Anson in bed with a man , I had never seen a hint of physical affection between him and another beyond the warm casual , and when the visitors began to come to our apartment , this aspect of his behavior continued . The men only held his fingers in gentle hand/shake or put their cheeks against his briefly in formal greeting . He had called a friend and asked him to pass the word , to say that Anson felt he probably would not be going out any more now and that he would welcome visitors . I brought flowers and arranged them , had a woman come in to clean the place , stocked coffee , wine , cheese , some fruit and cookies . I organized the kitchen and living room , puttingthings in their proper place and order . Anson asked me to hang some of his most recent drawingsin the living room , and when the visitors began to come I saw the point of this ; the drawings gave them something to talk about in the face of Anson 's appearance , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that he would not be coming back from it . Though the drawings were of women and men in clothing , they were not really fashion renderings . There were buildings and other structures in the background , and it was these that the eye went to . Anson 's old way with history , that unsentimental past that I had seen in The Chief bar so long ago was there in them , refined over the years into an exquisite fixing . I looked at them when I felt the need to fight against my own beginning nostalgia , that which was coming on as the fact of Anson 's leaving became increasingly apparent . The men who came brought things , drawing pads and pencils , small boxes of fine candy , potted plants , art catalogues . Anson received them in the living room , fully clothed and carefully groomed . The men would sit in a tight circle around his chair , laughing lightly and talking with animation , denying everything they knew . They would touch each other to make a point , touch Anson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall , and never stay for very long . They were mostly lean and delicatemen , but beside Anson they looked robust . I would see the moisture in their eyes when I took them to the door . Some would touch me on the arm familiarly in their leaving , look at me knowingly and try to smile.  |p124In  those final days , Anson received many cards and some long letters . Most of the cards were ones with no printed messages inside of them , museum cards with fine historical illustrations and handwritten notes inside . The letters mostly said that the writer found it impossible to come visit , business and distance , but I think we both knew that the real reasons were otherwise , fear of contagion , fear of contact with the dying . None of the letters came from women . All of the women we knew came in person , and unlike the men they were not guarded in their behavior . Some wept openly when they saw Anson , smiling through their tears , dabbing at their makeup and squeezing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even spoke with him about his illness , asking questions , drawing Anson into animated talk about doctors and medicine . They stayed longer than the men did , and the gifts they brought were mostly useful things , seldom things to eat or look at , handkerchiefs , soft pillows and towels . They came mostly in groups of two or three , models in gay summer clothing who knew each other both professionally and socially , and most in their stay spent some private time with me in the kitchen over coffee . Being in our home seemed to relax them with me even further than before . They seemed to feel even safer , and many poured out their hearts to me , speaking of wishes for major changes in their lives while there was still time . They spoke of sex intimately , of their dissatisfactions with men and what they wanted that the men they knew could not give them . I listened to them , watching them , fascinatedand in a passion that was so deep I could feel it in the roots of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees . And in the ways they sat facing me , the ways their knees opened slightly and their breasts hung forward against the fabric of their blouses , the way their hands shaped the holding and touching they longed for and described , I felt that sad , false intimacy , but a sensuality beyond what I had ever experienced . They pressed the whole lengths of theirp125bodies against me at the door in parting , but I knew they only felt free to do this because they thought they knew I would not rise up against them . And I did n't rise up . Somethingin me , though I wanted what their talk had brought me desperately , checked me . The fabric of our clothing was like a real wall between us . They really did n't know me any better than I knew myself , any better than I knew Anson or he me . I would have hoped , in those last days , for more talking , for something , any little thing that could have brought me closer to an understanding . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anson did say , laughing at the absurdity of it , that he would miss me . And he talked also , in reminiscence , about things we had done together , places and events . Still , there was nothing really that came close to the root of it , and I began to wonder if there was a root . Maybe it was just the years themselves , us and our comings and goings . Maybe it was only habit and trite dependency . I said these things to myself , but I did not believe them . I thought of Lorca and knew there was no real difference . Anson talked of Maudie some , and that seemed to be a blessing . His eyes would brighten in the memory . He spoke in detail of her bees , her miniatures , what she had done for his art . There seemed nothing of nostalgia in his talking , just a pure pleasure in reminiscence . Then Anson died . I knew it by the silence in the cot besideme when I woke in the morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the end . There had been few visitors , and by nine o'clock Anson was ready for bed . We talked a little , lying beside each other , when the lights were off . But though I searched that talk later for significance , there was none that I could discover . It had been about the visitors , medicine that I would pick up for him , a gift of a thirties fashion book that he had enjoyed receiving . I could n't remember how the talking had finished , whether it was Anson or I who had fallen asleep first within it . There were no last words that have stayed with me.  |p126The  woman came and took Anson to Utah . The cot remained in place for a few days , and I left the drawings hanging in the living room where I had affixed them temporarilyto the walls . I ordered Anson 's clothing in the closet and in his drawers , but for a while I did not pack it . And there were cups and saucers with the dregs of coffee still in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resting on the edges of open shelves . There were smears of lipstick on the rims of some of the cups , and I used them for my own coffee in the first few mornings , placing my lips over the red smears as I drank . It was only after a week that I cleaned the place thoroughly , longer still before I had any sense that I 'd be leaving . Then it was that Anson faded , ever so slightly , and images of Lorca rose up , opaque shadows at first , but growing stronger as the days and weeks passed . We had lived in that small house behind her parents ' house , it seemed to me as I began to think of it as a way against our possible commitment to one another , our taking on of a real and separate life together . We had not started out wrongly . From the very beginningthere was a certain passion between us , acquisitive and for details . Mine was for anatomy , names of body mechanicsthat had soon enough spilled out its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to know flowers , the exoticones in that city , and the names of trees lining the freeways . Then I turned it to anything : small pinwheels at a carnival ; automobiles , the workings of which had frustrated me as an adolescent ; the way fabrics were woven ; variety in the chemistry of herbs . Lorca 's passion was for literature , the details of its spectacle , and the ways objects and events in it could echo in her life . I would speak of the way somethingworked , name all its parts , and she would place it in a context in which its workings could have significance , and had in a novel or in a poem , and how that significance was related to our own , to her own at least , and mostly in the past . The world , in our beginning , was rich ; I gave it voicep127and name and Lorca gave it context . And while that contextwas not always in the present , it was enough for both of us . It generated a certain closeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it . I knew nothing of her real past within its own prosaic frame , but I did not know this . She was drawing all along , even beginning to paint , but she seemed to hold this secondary , relatively unimportant , and I saw no passion in it . And there was that other passion too , limpid , though we were unaware of that . It seemed fired in ways we did not think about by our proximity to her parents ' house , the flicker of lights there and the shadow movements of her mother and father as I entered her . They were no more than fifty feet away from us , and while they might have thought vaguely about what we might be doing , the lights off , the flicker of candles that they could see , they would n't have had the images , the vision of their daughter who remainedyoung because she still lived there , and of a young man , their son-in-law , who was not their child , the two playing the adult game , no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was our unspoken feeling of it , was why I think we sometimes laughed like little children playing with matches . Lorca may have had some passage in mind at such times , some similar dance of characters to place us . I watched the way her muscles moved , gauging the distance to the house over and over . It was sexuality in a story , and what we did not find at all within it we found around it . We did not know that it was mostly vacant , not until the end at least , but it was too late then . Lorca stole some dresses . Our marriage had been no accident of time or proximity ; we courted methodically . But there had quickly come that time when we felt that we knew each other deeply . The evidence was quick thought and a kind of common perception . We laughed at the same unfunny things , we articulated structures that others seemed to miss , we felt we were attuned in the same ways to the world 's flow . We lived behind her parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late together , and Ip128was raw in my profession . Then the stolen dresses came , heavier than the clear air we felt we lived in . They were a missed opportunity , maybe , for a better closeness . At least I saw things this way . I 'm not sure about Lorca . It was winter , a time for fall clothes in California , but the two dresses were for summer , cottons and paisleys , and not from the shop Lorca worked in . They had her in a cage in a too public room in the women 's section of the county jail . It was a lesson , somethingpossibly good for adolescents , but she was too old for it . Her father had some influence . He had paid the shop immediatelyand made some phone calls . They detained her only until we came to get her , then let her go with a warning . She was in the cage in her own clothing , and before they let her out they gave her father the dresses he had paid for . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to a metal trash can in a corner and stuffed them into it . I was at the bars , and though I saw her eyes as she watched her father I could see no real expression in them . " Nice dresses , " I said . " But you goofed the season . " She looked at me , but there was no intimacy or sharing in her eyes . " It was because I wanted something , " she said . " Who from ? " " You would n't understand , " she said , and though I touched her hand at the bar I could feel nothing in it . It was cool and relaxed . I stroked it and she did n't move it . Much later I was to remember the feel of it and to think that it was like the feel of Anson 's hand when I held it in his last days . It was n't until after Anson died that I thought of it again , thinking that it might not be the same at all and that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , the real constant in the two events . The stolen dresses brought the beginning of the end , or at least marked it . But it was a slow ending . It was no drawing apart , but a growing recognition that what we thought was closeness was other than that . It was many good things , but it was not that . And what that was , ourp129frustrated search for it , or at least mine , is what kept us together , the search moving away from the personal entirely , becoming almost philosophical , then returning at the end , for me at least , as an abasement of knowledge , not about us , but about myself . We did things with Carl and Anne . I thought about Melchior on occasion , moody and nostalgic in that sense that with him things had been right I thought . Anne spent private times with Lorca . Carl and I acted like friends together . There was the dress shop and my massages . And there were long evenings spent in quiet conversation , playingcards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in California , the longing even in that undramatic , western fall . Then Lorca left suddenly , but not before the end . We had been lingering , and when she left I knew it , knew we 'd been fixed in inertia and that there would have been no marking of the ending otherwise . There was some time afterward that I do n't really remembervividly , the move from the little house , a settling of affairs . Then , after a while , I met Anson and that other thing began . Lorca and Anson . Each was afterward like a puppet standing knee-deep in the folded contours of my troubled brain . And after both of them left they were figures on strings , hitting against each other lightly , the strings twisting , then spinning out away from each other , but never far enough for me to lose them . I always found a way to tug them closer , considering , not knowing . They were on the shifting platform of the Bishop 's diorama , the light changingits focus as the platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dark hair obscuring her features . Each was in the middle of a gesture , a hand uplifted , a hip slung , or a chin pointing , and each seemed ready and on the brink of speech . But there was thick glass between us , and even had they changed to animation and language I would n't have heard them . At least I saw it all this way , and in seeing it was shocked at my imagination , my fancy . It was something about my life I was after , nothing to bep130gained or gotten at through metaphor . I acted as if I were in literature , one of Lorca 's analogues , or in Anson 's past which , also like literature , was only a story for the mind to work as it saw fit . And now I was heading south , down to the roots of my own past , at least that part of it that had been moving me since Anson 's death . So far , with Melchior and Carl and Anne , I was not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see my own posture a little more clearly and for what it was , a little cool , as Anson had once joked of it , a little distant and without connection . Still , that may have been a part only of awkward reconnection . So far the kind of world the Bishop had warned me about , its powers to change me should I enter it , had not been there , or at least I had not noticed it if it was . I felt I wanted that . Unlike the Bishop , I saw my life , my years with Lorca and Anson , as a kind of uncentered drifting , and anything that would correctthat seeming I 'd welcome . At least , that 's the way I saw it , recognizing that I might be totally naive , a middleagedPollyanna , and in for more than I wished . Lorca . I remember the titillation of the little lights , diffusedthrough our curtains , from the main house . Our own candles , dim and at a distance on counter and bookshelf . Lorca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back arched and her head elevated , and I am behind her , holding her at the waist and entering her . I see her hands make fists , gripping the coverlet , feel her knees walk open a little . I can not see her face at all . Her long , hanging hair cowls it completely . Though in her and moving and holding her , I feel I am trying to somehow keep up with her , to get to where her indistinguishable sounds tell me she is going . It is as if she will soon ram her face into the wall , will go through the wall , that I will drop out of her as she heads away from me . Her hips will slip from my oily hands . I will be left in the posture of one who has dropped a large urn , his hands still shaping it in the air , his head down , looking at the shards . And when I look up , past my distended sex , I will see thep131final closure of the wall her body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressing against the intractable wood where she has passed . I will feel my sex falling , my muscles and head sag , imagining what a sad and comic sight I would be for anyone standing beside me who cared to look . I was haunted by glimpses of things I half remembered as I passed them : a street on the left , ending in a blind glow of afternoon sunlight but beginning in familiar roofs and facades , stores and parking lots . I had spent two nights on the road , one in Yosemite and one in San Francisco , and had made the last long leg to Hollywood in a single day . In my hours in Yosemite I had seen El Capitan , that huge rock obelisk that Carl , Banyon , and Kip had ascended , and I had walked through open places among rocks and trees where the picture of the girl might have been taken , though it might have been miles from where I was . The park was beautiful , but for me a moody feel hung over it ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , and what had been furtive for Carl there added a mystery , not a titilating but a strangely frightening one . I realized that fear could well have played its part in Anne 's decision to remain with him for so long , even after she knew it was time to be leaving . I hoped I had precipitated something while with her , but I found I feared that possibility at the same time . I found a shop that handled Indian artifacts , but there was nothing there that looked like the ones in Sharonville . Reaching the street we had lived on and turning into it , I saw that the white paint on the curbs was chipped and that the numbers in front of many of the houses were worn away . At the end of the block the hedge lining the sixth fairway of the golf course was ragged and untended , and when I got closer I could see that the fairway itself was brown and burned out . I parked in front of the house , the third from the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The white lintel was flaking , as were the windowsills , and the door was scarred and cracked atp132the hinges . The sun was behind her , coming through from the back of the house , when she opened the door , and I could not see her clearly . " David ? " she said , no real surprise in her voice at all , and stood aside so I could enter . The house had n't changed much , the same heavy furniture and the same lamps and carpeting . When I got past the glare , I could see clear through to the other end , to windows in the dining room through which the little house was visible . Lorca 's mother was much the same as well . She still had bits of her sporty carriage , though by then she must have been in her midsixties . She moved a little stiffly , but I suspected that was a simple awkwardness in my presence . " Sit down , " she said , opening both her hands , indicating I should choose my place . I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evenings , and she sat on the couch across from me . I saw the lines at the sides of her eyes then and the way the flesh hung a little at her neck . There was a pot and cups on the coffee table between us , and after she had poured she held up the cream pitcher , looking at me , and I nodded . I leaned forward and took the cup from her hand . " I 'm sorry about Jack , " I said . Her eyes blinked and she looked away . " Oh , that was three years ago . Almost . " Her eyes returned from the window . " But why did you come west ? " she said . " I sent you everything I could dig out . " I saw the cardboard boxes piled in the room beyond us , a carpet rolled in a corner . " I do n't know , " I said . " Ready for a change , I guess . Something . You said in your letter that you were moving , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's right . Since Jack died the neighborhood has gone down . It 's time to get out . " I could tell it was more than that . There had been a sureness in her in the past , a way of speaking and acting ,  |p133that  was now gone . I knew I had things to ask her , but I despaired of answers even before I spoke . " You wrote that you 'd heard nothing at all from Lorca . Have you ever heard where she might have gone ? " " You know as well as I do , " she said , her shoulders rising a little in a halfhearted shrug . " Only those letters we got in the beginning . The one you got and the one we got . Jack and I. Did n't they come from Phoenix ? " " Do you think that 's where she went ? " I was only goingthrough the paces now . She knew no more than I did , and that was clear to me . Still , I had to get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world can know ? There was nothing I found in the little house after you left . She could have done . But there was nothing said about that at the dress shop , as I remember . " I caught a brief remnant of concern in her eyes and the British locution , a holdover from fake language at the tennisclub . Her hands were fidgeting with her cup and saucer ; a little of the coffee had spilled to her fingers . I looked down at my own hands and saw they were not too steady either . I was bringing things up unfairly . " Do you want to see the little house ? " she said , and she rose to her feet , settling the matter before I could answer . She left me at the back door , handing me the key that hung on a hook beside it . The little house was dark , the shades drawn and the curtainspulled across them , and only after I had bared a couple of windows could I see that the place was almost empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of end tables remained , pushed into a corner , and there were a dozen or so cardboard boxes resting , helter-skelter , on the floor . I opened a few of them , finding only Lorca 's things : books , some old clothing and school notes . Then I saw my name on the side of one of the boxes and went to it , opening it and spreading its contents around me where I squatted.  |p134The  box contained remnants and tag ends of my life with Lorca , things she had saved that dealt with both of us . There were ticket stubs and programs , notes I had left for her , pieces of clothing that I had bought her as presents . There was even a worn deck of cards that we had used in games with Carl and Anne , and there were two sticks of incense , wrapped carefully in tissue , which I opened and sniffed , the faint remaining smell bringing her back to me briefly . Her mother had packed this box . At least I guessed she had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a shame I thought , but I was n't sure at all that I believed that . It was at least a shame for her mother . I 'd had no right to come here , to bother her in this way , not even a good reason for it . I 'd really expected nothing . It was just a necessary stop . To see the little house again , to return before I went further . When I got back to the house , Lorca 's mother was in the living room , sitting as she had before , looking down at her cold cup of coffee . She glanced up at me as I entered the room . " Did you find anything ? " she said . " No , " I said . " There 's nothing . " She nodded , touching the edge of her saucer , then moved her hand to the side of her nose and absently rubbed it . " Well , I 'll be leaving , " she said . " Pretty soon now . What will you be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Is there anything at all ? Before I leave ? " " I wish there were . For my own sake , but there 's nothing . I do n't know any more than you do . " I felt her last words as a little accusative , saw her eyes sharpen as she looked over at me . But that did n't last . She sighed and her eyes unfocused again . She lifted her cup , looked into it and put it down . I left her at the door , and when I got to the car and looked back she was still standing there , the last of the sun/light at her back obscuring her features . I lifted my arm in a wave before I got in , and I saw her hand reach her chest for a moment and then fall back to her side . I made a U-turn at the end of the block , and when I passed the house again I saw that she was still standing where I had left her.  |p139If  in the passage of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some instant I could turn and return into my own past again , could find them there , each in the clarity of all that specific detail , what would the quality of that be like , recognizable , a dream come true that was never the way it was ? Nostalgia : the Bishop had warned me against it , and still I had places to go . Utah this time , down into his past , possibly that of Anson , the wished for of Lorca 's , that was at least in link with my own , those undiscoveredreasons for her leaving and my return . I wanted all friends and lovers to be together , in some hive of activity , of answers to which I had no questions . But of my ways with men and women , that was an understanding that I could not fear to search for , that possible changing , as for the Bishop , of my whole life . Brief little wedges so far , momentsof quick revelation , with Melchior , with Carl andp140Anne , but nothing much lighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an earring , unclothed bodies in a circular pool : nothing final , no real turning of the diorama . I lingered . There was so much change along the coast and in L.A. and San Diego that it was hard for me to keep my bearings . New buildings everywhere ; low , gentle ridges of hills along Route 1 ripped away and replaced with condominiums ; fresh , major arteries in the freeway system . Gulesarian 's was now a parking lot , and when I found the place where Anson and I had lived , there was new aluminumfacing on the old brick and the street was under repair . I parked a block away and walked in front of the place a few times . The ground floor was now a fast-food joint , and the windows that had faced the street from our apartmenthad been ripped out and replaced with awkward bays . I found The Chief , on a relatively unchanged street , but there was a different name over the door , and when I went inside I found myself under the gun of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lifted a beer to Anson , looking at the place where the Chief had taped his drawing up . The Chief was no longer there . It was a young woman in knit stockings and a short , little skirt who waited on me , perfunctorily , not meeting my eyes or smiling . I searched for the place where Carl and Anne had lived , near the university , but I could n't find it . Lorca 's dress shop was now a record store . I lingered for a week in that sprawling city , a place that I had known intimately but now hardly recognized . I shopped for rougher gear , camping equipment I thought I might need , and had the car serviced . I took in a few movies , watched television in bleak motels , went to the restaurantsI remembered that remained . Food was awkward in my mouth , like childhood dishes that are too sweet or bland when tasted again . Then I headed for San Diego . The Naval Hospital was very much the same , but though I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even managed to find my way into the corpsmen 's barracks where our cubicles had been , finding the same paint , the same layout and furniture , I could not call nostalgia up , and stood blankly in spaces I could not feel I had ever really been in . I even went to Tijuana , but that was no good either . Then I found myself , on a sunny day , sitting on a bench in Balboa Park . There was a strong , soft breeze blowing , carrying a faint scent of the zoo with it , a pleasant smell , and I was eating something from a vending wagon , drinking a Coke . It had been two weeks since I 'd left Lorca 's mother at her door , and though I knew I 'd been lingering , holding back , I had not really articulated that to myself . The park was full of people . It was Saturday , and as I watched the strollers and sightseers , I caught a glimpse of Anson . He was standing at the brink of a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt myself tensing and rising from the bench as he turned . He even looked like Anson when I saw his face , but when he walked from the eucalyptus shadow , I saw he was a younger man by far , hardly more than a teenager . I went back to my hotel then and packed up . I had lingered long enough . I spent the night in a barren little town the other side of Needles , in a small motel . There was nothing odd about the town itself , just one of those places with no visible industry , no reason other than a few remnants of long-gone tourist trade for its existence  --  dusty streets , haphazard boarding of shops , weeds growing in the baselines of an abandoned ball field . Few people were in the streets or in cars when I entered the place at five , too early for lights in the windows of houses . At the end of the short main street I saw a sign , a broken wooden arrow pointing the way : Motel 1/4 mile . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the place , a brief , boxy rectangle , six identical doors with identical windows beside them . In front of each room , on a cracked concretep142slab , was a metal chair with a garbage can beside it . The hacked-off trunk of a dead tree stood at roof level in front of one of the rooms . There were no cars at all , only a dusty pickup , and that in front of a room at the far end of the building , marked Office above the door . The doors of the rooms had been painted a deep red once , the window frames , matching the metal chairs , an olive green . The paint had oxidized , and was now a worn pastel . It was as if the whole place had once been colorless , like a black and white photograph that was then tinted . The sky over the roof was still black and white , low storm clouds holding dry desert dust . " Is anybody here ? " I said . The screen door below the Office sign was opaque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond it was open . I heard a shuffling , like paper , and the scrape of a chair , then a cough or a word spoken . When I opened the door , she was on her feet , putting something away in a metal box at the desk ; the lid of the box kept me from seeing what it was . Her body seemed young , short , economical , and wiry , but when her face came up I could see she was over sixty . She just looked at me . " I 'm just in from Needles , " I said , though that was a littlemisleading , and I wondered why I had said it . " Needles ? " she said . " Yes , " I said . " Do you have a room ? " She came from behind the desk , a small metal office desk ; the room was no real office but just another motel room with the furniture removed . There was an old refrigerator in the corner , two metal chairs like the ones outside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept her hand on the metal box . " Oh , sure . Plenty of them , " she said . " Do you want a waterbed ? " " Oh , no , " I said . " Just a room . " " That 's good . There certainly are n't any of those here . " It was a joke , but she did not laugh or smile.  |p143She  took me to the room , the one with the dead tree trunk in front of it , and handed me the key . I gave her the twenty dollars ; there had been nothing to fill out . " Is there a restaurant , a place to eat ? " " Oh , no , " she said . " There 's nothing like that here . " " How about Needles ? " I said . " Needles ? I would n't know about that . I 'd guess so . " " Okay , thanks , " I said , and she turned and walked back toward the office . I was only in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went back to the car to unload what I needed and saw the back of her head through the small rear window as the truck pulled out to the roadway . I had to turn against the dust that rose up , and when I looked back she was gone . I went down to the office and opened the screen door . The inside door was still open , but there was no one there . After I had unpacked the trunk and taken my things into the room , I laid what I had on the bed and chair and took inventory . If I needed other things , I felt I 'd better get them soon . I had no idea what was ahead of me . I had my leather work bag , one small suitcase , and a small duffle . I 'd brought a suit , a few white shirts , socks and underwear . The rest of the clothing was the rough wear that I 'd purchasedon the way : jeans , sweatshirts and workshirts , a pair of outdoor boots , tennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , figuring it might be nice to sleep out when I got into the right country for it . The sheaf of Anson 's drawings lay on the bed , as did the box Lorca 's mother had sent me . I took my ditty into the small bathroom , stripped to the waist , and washed up . Then I got the one smudged glass I could find , poured out a shot of bourbon , and went and sat in the metal chair in front of the room and sipped it . The sky looked angrier now , the clouds had darkened , and though I could see the low roofs of the small town in the distance , beyond them the air was dust- or rain-filled , opaque . In a while I got up and walked clear around thep144building , but there was nothing to see . The ground was empty all the way to the horizon on all sides ; only the small-town buildings rose up from it , and they were low , and the sky seemed to be pressing them down into the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could feel it stinging against my arms . I went inside then and got my wallet and jacket , figuring I 'd better find someplace to eat . When I got to the main street again , it seemed to me that there were more buildings boarded up than I had noticed before . There were no cars at all on the road now , and though the dark sky had faded in the last remaining sunlightbefore dusk , there were no lights in the windows of houses down side streets that I passed . When I reached the town 's far side , I found the highway turnoff and accelerated in the direction of Needles , which was no more I judged than a few miles away . Soon it was raining , only large and well-spaced drops , but enough to smear my windshield , and I had to slow down . In twenty minutes I realized I must have taken the wrong road out . Real dusk was beginning now , and though the road was straight and flat I could see no lights or buildings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found nothing , and took a narrower road that wound off into the desert on my left . In five minutes I saw the lights of a gas station , slowed down , and pulled in at the pumps . The pumps were lit , dim coronas of light reflected off my hood . I reached over and rolled the passenger window down and saw lights and movement in the office beyond the pumps . After what seemed a long time , the door opened and a figure in coverallscame out . At first I was startled , thinking it was the woman from the motel , but as she approached I saw that this one was a little younger , taller , and smiling in a way the other had not done . I leaned over toward the window . Halfway to the car , the woman stopped and looked up . There was a sharp crack of thunder , and the sky opened , the rain coming down immediately in heavy sheets . She turned in it , judg/ing the distance back , then shrugged and bent into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I called out in the roar the rain made . Her face and hair were flooding with water when she reached the door ; drops bounced from her brow in through the open window and onto the seat . " What ? " she called out . " Needles ! " I yelled . She shook her head , then lifted her rain-soaked arm and pointed back in the direction from which I had come . BeforeI could speak again , she turned and ran back toward the office . I looked through the rain , following her , hoping she would come back again or give some other sign . The windows of the office were sheeted with rain , and I could not see in to her once she had entered . Then , in a few moments , I saw the lights go out , then the lights of the pumps themselves . I turned around then and headed slowly back up the road . The rain was already running in shallow rivers at the shoulders , and I could make no more than fifteen miles an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another twenty minutes , but came to nothing . When I found my way back to the motel , it was still raining . There were no lights in the building at all , though it was no more than eight o'clock . The next morning I bummed a cup of coffee from thewoman in the office . She gave it freely but without a smile . " Good dinner ? " she said , as I took the cup to the door . " Not really , " I said . " I could n't find Needles . " " It rained hard , " she said . " Right , " I said , and left . Back in the sad little room I bathed , dressed , and prepared to leave . I 'd gotten a local map in Needles , and I ran my finger over it , tracing the way northeast , figuring the regional byways against empty spaces on the small atlas that I had brought with me . The atlas showed empty areas of desert , but on the local map there were veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was overp146half full , and I would n't have to stop for an hour or more . When I reached the highway again , I headed northeast , away from Needles or the direction in which I thought it was ; I was n't exactly sure after my trouble the night before . It seemed that Needles was a hard place to get back to , and I felt as if some door or other had closed behind me once I had left it . I was glad I was n't heading back or trying to . Not yet , at least . There were no signs at the place where I entered the highway , but I knew from the map that I would pick up the road I wanted in a short time . I drove slowly ; the blacktop on the road was rough , the shoulders narrow , and when I found the turn I wanted , I had to drive even slower . I settled on a comfortable forty miles an hour , flipped on the air conditioner , and shifted in the seat until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the name of the town the woman had taken Anson 's body to and Anson 's sketches of Maudie 's house ; he 'd kept them all those years , and they and just a few other things were all I had kept of Anson 's belongings . There were things in storage with my own things , but I had n't gone through them with any care . The town was small and not on the general maps , but I found it on the local , sectional ones I 'd looked over . It was southeast , just over the border in Utah . I figured to get there in the morning . I would camp out under the stars tonight . The air was clear , the clouds gone , and though it was hot , it was dry and there was a light breeze stirring in the few growths poking up out of the desert . And the desert would fall away soon ; I could see higher country and green , I thought , in the distance . Of Lorca , I had absolutely nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the name of the Bishop 's school , Nativity , but could figure no help at all from that . I had some resolve , but no real place to put it . When I left the desert and started up into low hills and pine , I found a road that took me a little south but still east . I would avoid the Grand Canyon , then head due north , upp147into the bottom of the state . I ate breakfast and lunch in small gas station restaurants , ones without tourists , almost empty , just a few men , an occasional woman , people with lives I had no idea about . I stopped at a park in a small town , another wasted place like the one near Needles , and spread out maps and Anson 's sketches on a picnic table and studied them . No one was in the park , and though I sat there for most of an hour , few cars passed by and not a single figure walked the streets . I heard a few sharp birdcalls , ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky far to the north . When the sun began to sink , I left the place , driving slowly to the outskirts of the town , and looked for a campground , but I could n't find one . Finally I settled for a short hike up into fir trees off a winding dirt road , and set up camp in a clearing . The sky was in view above me ; there was no moon , and the stars were cold and brilliant . Though I had put the tent up , I slept outside , gazing into the sky , letting the sight soothe and help me to sleep . In the morning I made instant coffee , using the car 's lighter socket to heat the small element , and was back on the road by seven . At ten o'clock , I came to the gates of Utah . The terrain had leveled , the road straightened , and I saw the two white obelisks a good mile before I reached them . Even at a distance I could make out the fashioned structuresat their tops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one standing at each side of the road . As I got closer , I saw the web of grating that was a gate between them and the large iron letters of Utah spanning across below the tips . When I came to a stop at the gates , a man in green fatiguesstepped out from behind one of the pillars . He had a rifle slung from his shoulder . He came to the gates , opened them enough to get through , unslung his weapon , and moved carefully off to the side of my left fender , then motionedwith his barrel . I could see he was saying something , but my window was closed , and I could not hear him.  |p148When  I looked to the gates and pillars , I saw that three more men had appeared , all with weapons . One was dressed like the first man ; the other two , their hair pulled back tight and tied in ponytails , were clearly Indians ; their dress was less military , and they had fringe and beads at their sleeves and necks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windshield . The structures at the tops of the obelisks were stone beehives , extremely stylized , almostabstract in their hard-edged compartments. " ... roof of the car . " I heard the end of a sentence as I rolled the window down . " Get out and put your hands on the roof of the car . " I did what I was told , keeping my hands in view and in front of me as I opened the door and slipped out . The other three were standing well away from each other , and they had their rifle barrels leveled at me . I turned my head from the roof and started to speak when I was in position . " Not yet , " one of the Indians said and then moved over to me and frisked me carefully . I felt my wallet slip from my pants pocket , and for a moment I tightened , suspecting that this might be robbery . They kept me where I was for a good five minutes . I heard a car door open , the crackling of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the side and watched me while the two Indians went through my trunk , glove compartment , and backseat . No one threatened me in any way , but they were all very efficient and serious and I could tell they 'd done this many times . It was getting hot . The sun reflected brightly off the roof of the car and into my face , and I could feel sweat bleeding out on my brow . Then I heard the car door slam , my own truck lid close , and the sound of the crackling radio was cut off . After a brief silence , the spokesman , in a softer tone now , told me it was okay , I could move and turn around . When I did so , I saw that the rifles were slung again and that the four had relaxedtheir postures . I did n't speak , but they must have seen the questions in my face.  | " It 's pot hunters , " one of the Indians said . He was tall and broad , and he spat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what that is , " I said . The uniformed men stood a little away from the Indians , but it was clear that they were all committed in this thing together . " Better to let it be , " the spokesman said . " They come up this way is all ; we watch for them . You can go through . " The two Indians were already working the gates open . When I was back in the car and driving through , I saw the two Jeeps , both with long aerials , off to the side of the obelisks . They had thick and studded off-road tires , and there were tubes of roll bars spanning over the cabs . I could n't figure how they could catch anybody , clustered in one place like this , but then I did n't know the terms at all . Pot hunters . I 'd never heard that , but I did remember something . There were Carl 's pottery pieces on that shelf in Sharonville . Kokopelli , Karla had said , and something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrain changed immediately , from the green and trees of the other side to red rock , sand , and low scrub . Four large soaring birds , buzzards or hawks , I thought , rode currents down the state line , high in the air to the left . They seemed to tip in toward Utah when they got close to crossing . Before I 'd gone a hundred feet , I knew I was in another state entirely . I found the house that Anson had sketched with very little difficulty , and to my surprise I found the place , I was sure , where he had gotten his ear pierced . It was now no more than a rambling shack on the far side of the town , a mile or so out on a back road . There were four motorcycles parked in the dirt in the small yard , one of them with a dark leather jacket draped as an insignia over the saddle . I could read the jacket 's inscription as I drove slowly by ; Pot Warriors , it said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the window beside the door , there was a smallp150broken neon sign , E RS , with the glass tubes curved in the shape of a crude ear under the letters . It had taken longer than I had expected to get to the town . The roads were not well marked . At one place , what I thought was the road in ended in a sawhorse barricade , and I had to backtrack for a few miles . Just when I thought I was lost and would have to find someone for directions , the road I was on turned and dipped down a little , and I saw the first buildings , set in no clear order , well back behindovergrown yards . The town itself was even more wasted than the one I 'd stopped in outside of Needles . The difference was that it was not on flat land , but set deep in a canyon , ringed almost totally with huge red rock pillars , dusty-looking , that seemed to suck up whatever sunlight washed over them . I could see large birds soaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their heads down and searching  --  drifting over the town itself , over the buildings and the tall dead trunks of the numerous oaks and old maples that spiked up in careful rows along the town streets . It was clear that the trees had been planted , in some lost time , had needed care and had not gotten it . Now they had been topped , some at thirty feet or more , and some had what looked like man-made objects set in the stubs of their hacked-off top branches , organic-looking figures , some facelike , others like limbs and viscera . I saw few people , and no children , a few motorcycles and old half-primed cars in the yards before the houses . Windows were broken , peeling paint and cracked shingles . The only open business-placesthat I saw as I searched for Anson 's house were a gas station , a rundown-looking coffee shop , and what I took to be a kind of general store . I did not explore the town , but only took what slow turns I needed to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed much . The vacant lot across from it was still there . The street it was on seemed totally abandoned , vacant places where houses had burned or been demolished , boards on the windows of those remaining.  |p151A  very short street really , a dead end , with cement fracturedinto dirt where it petered out at a thick wall of twisted vines and brush . I sat across from the house in the car , at a place where I thought Anson himself might have sat , working on his sketches . The steps , porch and door were the same , though one of the porch pillars was leaning , and the porch itself dipped down a little at its center . There was nothing but a dark vacancy in its windows . I could evoke no presence at all of anyone having ever lived there . I suppose I had thought something might come to me when I got there , something I could use in some way , but nothing did . The house had no real history for me at all . It was Anson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it for a long time , trying to imagine Maudie standing at the door , picturing what might be inside , what living room and bedroom might look like , I could not get beyond its real deadness , into his history or hers , and through that back to myself somehow . At least the place was not haunted for me , not in the way it had been in Anson 's story of it . It seemed final now , unimportant , and glancing from it to the sketches on the seat beside me , they too began to deaden , losing what had been of the presence of Anson and his past and self in them . I suspected that at least was a gain for me , though the loss of it hurt me . Could it be such closure of romance that I was after ? To go back in order to get rid of Anson , what I thought I held of him in memory , to eat away that dreaming in the face of hard reality ? The house had been old even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . And now it seemed the house was ready to crumble , the pillars to fall and the porch to sink into the earth . I could come back in a few years and find no remnant . Would that be better , be enough for me ? I felt disgusted in my now specific frustration . I knew less of what I was after than before I 'd begun . Where there were plantings , flowers , along the sides of the porch in the sketches , there was nothing now . No bees moved in the air that I could see . Oh , Maudie , I could sleep my way into death with you . Ip152have no child to begin again , no Anson or Lorca . What I think I want is still beyond my understanding . I loosened my grip on the steering wheel , my palms coming away sticky , as if some residual of oil had worked its way to the surface . I flexed my hands and looked at them , the muscles still prominent along the fingers . I had touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not since Karla 's body was under my hands in Sharonville . I needed that again and itched for it , my hands on Lorca 's body this time , if I could find her . I started the car up and did not look back at the house as I pulled away . I found the cemetery on the other side of the town , a littleup in the barren foothills beyond a closed up school of some sort . The school was fenced around , barbed wire strands at the top of cyclone webbing . Maybe it was a school that Anson had attended . There were broken and boarded windows there too , and along a high wall below windows I could see a faded complex of once colorful graffiti , what now looked like vague animal shapes , broken words , a progress of some kind , attenuated as it receded to a distance . There were a few trees in the cemetery , not stumps this time , but young trees , growing wild . The place was untended , the fence of white picket that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bleached out to a powdery grayness . There was a place to park , under a tree , and I pulled in and got out . The cemetery was small and bound with the remnants of fence ended by a row of straggly low bushes ; there was a portion of it , over a low rise , that I could not see from where I 'd parked , the tops of gravestones getting close to the ground in that direction , until they disappeared beyond the rise . Above the ragged young trees , I could see the red rock towers , the birds still floating among them , not too far in the distance . At their tops they thinned into blunt and spikey figures , slabs of cracked and twisted eruptions rising hundreds of feet into the bleak sky . Lower down they werep153thick and sheer , at places large as the sides of massive buildings . They seemed to lean in a little over the cemetery and the town , and though the sky was clear and cloudless there seemed insufficient light . I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floated , appearing suddenly , then drifting out of sight , entering crevasses , then gliding out again , always returning . I started with the closest row of stones and worked my way along . The carvings were simple , only a few severe messages and crude angel-shapes . Most often just names and dates , no clear ethnicity in the names that I could determine , short lives mostly ; few seemed to have lived beyondseventy . I did n't find Anson , or even Maudie , and I began to wonder if there might be another cemetery and if I should check that possibility . I did find a fresh grave , the earth newly turned and mounded along its length . The gravestone was bright and more modern than the others . I did not recognize the name , Corabina Ramholst , and the dates meant nothing to me . She had died three weeks ago . I looked at the grave site for a while , wishing it read differently , then I proceeded down the row . I had my head lowered , reading along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the cemetery 's ridge and heard the scuffling sound . I looked up , but it took me a moment to find the source of it . The stones were higher on the other side of the ridge , the plots clearly older , and I had to move to the side a bit before I found the kneeling figure . He was on his knees in front of a large stone , one in a tight gathering , an older family plot I guessed , deep in a corner of the cemetery . He had a paper taped over the stone , and he was rubbing it . I could see the muscles in his broad neck rolling as he worked . He wore a T-shirt and jeans and was hatless . Though there seemed nothing ominous about him at all , the cemetery and the town were unsettling , and I moved quietly toward him , a little anxious and not at all sure of myself . There were stones between us at times as I madep154my way down to him , and then I was to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than twenty feet away . I relaxed a little then , though I felt a flush rise in my cheeks . I shuffled a foot to get his attention , so as not to startle him . I saw his back stiffen , but it was the ridges in his neck that had relaxed me . I knew , before he turned on his knees , that it was Melchior.  |p155We  sat in the small kitchen of Melchior 's Airstreamtrailer , miles from the cemetery and the town , at a place where a dirt road ended and a small river ran . There were shade trees growing along the river 's bank , willow and tamarisk , and I could see the gentle waving of a few green leaves outside the little window across from me . Barbarahad brought me the letter and was now at the stove working at our dinner . It would be shad and small pieces of shad roe . " But this is a small house , " she said , and then she laughed , that laugh that I remembered and liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table between us and was shuffling through them , looking for the ones he wanted me to see . In the letter , postmarked only six days after I had left them in Sharonville , Anne said she had heard from Lorca . " Out of the blue , " she wrote . And now that Carl wasp156gone  --  " not coming back . That 's true . I 'm not kidding "  --  she was taking the kids and heading out to find her . " She sounds okay . She says she has something to tell me . I hope you get this letter sent ahead . " She did n't say where Lorca was exactly , but she mentioned a place called Manti . " That 's the other side of Dark Canyon , " Barbara said . " To the right of it on the map from where we are now . It 's a big national forest or something . I looked it up . " " What 's up with The Heat ? " I said . Barbara laughed , glancing over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melchior said . " Working the summer at some hotel in the city . He gets to wear a uniform ! " Though it felt odd to me that I was with them here , Melchior and Barbara seemed in a way relieved . They had come in from the south as I had , though by a different route , and the wasted , barren nature of the place had touched them too . They spoke of not seeing many people , of finding their maps inadequate . Melchior commented on the weirdness of the town where I had found him , the motorcyclesand the empty roads . " It does n't seem like America , " he said . " Certainly not like the West Coast , right ? " " It 's not my idea of a loose vacation spot , " Barbara said , flipping the shad fillets and pressing them down in the pan with a spatula . " But the cemeteries have been great , " Melchior said . " Take a look at this one . " He moved the pile of rubbings aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it coveredmost of the small table . The part that was taken from the stone itself was hard to separate out at first , but after Melchior had run his finger along the outline of it I could see what it had been before he 'd painted it . It was halfway between a child 's face and a skull , and the wings that had flanked it on the stone were still in evidence . Melchior had changed them though . They were now wings of hair , feathered back behind the face 's head . He had added hair above the wings and brought some wispy strands down to the cheeks , so that the facep157now seemed the part of a face that was visible behind a wild wig or fashionable teased cut . The hair was not unlike what I had seen on the heads of some of the models I had known when I was with Anson . But the properties of the face that were skull-like made the head of the figure sickly or at least in some way wasted . He had added a neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and narrow shoulders and breasts , and where the breasts swelled , low and a little aged , he had added a hint of ruffles , the beginning of some gown or other . The whole thing was done in pastels , ones that clashed slightly in clearly intentional ways . One ear lobe was visible , a little bluish , the dot of an earring embedded in it . It was a skillful , beautiful and unsettling thing that Melchior had done . I was surprised at it , and I told him that and how much I liked it . " From the morgue , I think , " he said . " Remember that ? I think that started it . I 've kept my eyes open since then . " " He 's been doing it for a long time , " Barbara said . " It 's good , huh ? " " As far as I know , it 's very good , " I said . And now there was another thing . Had Melchior mentioned this when I had seen him ? I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been doing it when we were in the Navy . I would have known about that , unlesshe had a part of a secret life he kept from me then . Not very likely . Still I thought of the Bishop 's warning of the past . " When did you get the time these years ? " I said . " I took it when I could . Barbara and Paul and I took little summer trips , New England and the South . A lot of graveyardsin this country . " He touched the edge of the pile of rubbings draped on the chair beside him . " This is only two weeks ' worth , this time around . " " He was in a show once in New Jersey . He and a few others , mostly women . Pictures of flowers ; you know , at a community center . " " Why Utah ? " I said . " The fish is almost ready , " Barbara said , and Melchiorp158got up and cleared away the rubbings and took them to the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began setting the table with plates and silver . " You mentioned it the day you visited us . We never thought of the place at all , but then we started to check out maps . It seemed a good place for our summer trip . " " Did I ? " I said . I could n't remember , but I must have mentioned something about Anson , the fact of the woman 's taking his body here . Had I mentioned Anson to them at all ? " Did I mention Anson ? " " I do n't think so , " Melchior said . " Who 's that ? " We ate our dinner and talked about what we might do next . " We 're free and easy , " Barbara said , and Melchior nodded . I filled them in a little on the letter , told them who Anne and Carl were and that I 'd been married to Lorca . They said I 'd mentioned her before . Barbara had the maps out on the table before we were finished eating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave my car , but Melchior said he had a hitch and that the Jeep could pull it easily . " I do n't know about the roads though . " " We can try it anyway , " Barbara said . " I 'd rather ride with you than follow , " I said . When we were finished eating and cleaning up , Melchior and I went down the few feet to the riverbank and had a smoke . It was dusk now , and the night birds were coming out , sitting close to us in the limbs of the young green trees and singing softly . The river was running low , but quickly , and we could see the streambed , lined with smooth rocks , through the clear water . On the other side , beyond the bank , there were older cottonwoods growing , and up the rise beyond them , and fixed against the darkening sky , we could see the barren structures of the huge rock formations of Dark Canyon . They looked like silhouettes , backlighted as they were now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bled through , rounding the red rock into ominous fig/ures , giant body parts in vague gestures . They seemed poised , ready to move toward us , unseen , when darkness finallycame . I could hear the birds twitter just above my head , and it was they who helped me pull my gaze away and back to the running river . We smoked , and Melchior talked just a little about San Diego again , then talked in some detail , and with quiet enthusiasm , about his rubbings and painting . It was something he would have done full time , had he been able , had he gotten any encouragement . He had from Barbara , and he suspected that that was why he 'd married her in the first place . He thought too that had she known , early on , how important they were to him , his life might have taken a differentcourse entirely . She would have stayed with him anyway . He might have become an artist . I told him that he probably was one . He laughed and shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him that I envied him , that doing massages only loosened others , gave them something . It came to me that I had been a watcher , a surrogate , and no participant . I did n't mention this , but Melchior seemed to know my thoughts or at least my sad feelings in thinking them . He did n't put aside my praise of him , but touched me in a while on my shoulder . We set out in the morning , three abreast on the wide front seat of the Jeep , the Airstream and my car hitched to the rear of it behind us . We were a strange caravan , but the Jeep was new and had plenty of power , and Melchior seemed to know the right way to drive it . For the first hour , the road was blacktop and the trees high enough to prevent our seeing very far ahead . It was a twisting and descending road , but the turns were wide and gradual enough to allow our caravan to pass with ease . At times we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limbs . Then in a while the trees began to thin out and shrink in size , and the rock became a constant presence through the windshield . When we reached the edge of Dark Canyon , the road turned from blacktop to dirt and began to descend quickly ,  |p160becoming  in less than a mile a vague and little used cut . We were down among the rock formations before we had any good sense of their size and scale in the larger scheme of the canyon . We had paused only briefly at the lip , and most of our concentration had been given to the sight of the initial steep descent . There were tire tracks visible in places , deeper ones where occasional spurs cut off from our way as we went down . The going was slow and careful , and Melchiorhad to keep his eyes in the side-view mirrors to get us through places where the rock came close up against our passage . Then we were down on the canyon floor ; the road leveled out , though still descending , and its twists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock and red dirt valleys , and in one of them we saw a huge hawk drop down and lift a running jackrabbit from the stubble of the valley floor . When we stopped to rest and got out , there were hawks and what I was sure now were buzzards , high and drifting at the pinnacles of the rock formations , against the rust-colored sky . It was hot , and twice the Jeep overheated . We had to wait for it to cool , and Melchior had to add water to the radiator . We saw no one the whole day , but once we saw the shape of a low rectangular dust cloud across a valley in the far distance , and were sure that it was the trail of some vehicle moving on a dusty road . The rock slabs and obelisks that rose around us were variousin size and shape . All were massive and barren , but wind and blown sand had shaped them differently into enigmaticfigures , some half organic , others like violent dream images of tilted and fractured cathedrals . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but these soon gave way and we were left only with massive and dusty red rock . As the day passed and our way wound and straightened and wound again , we seemed to be going deeper into the endless canyon and constantly descending . But then , around three o'clock , I was sure we had reached the bottom . Here the spaces were tighter ; there was red rock all around us , and we had to lean well out of our windows inp161order to see to where the slab walls tapered into spires , hundreds of feet above us . It was still early in the afternoon , but the red rock blocked the sun and deep shadows bled into the narrow trail . There were scratches on the sides of the Airstream now , rusty streaks where we had scraped against and crumbled the dusty rock surfaces as we moved slowly between them . In places , the road had no shoulder at all , and our tires crunched through small alluvial fans that spilled into our path from the base of the rock slabs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock were some kind of oxidizing metal . Once I had stood against it , to the rear of the Airstream as I guided Melchior through , and where the trailer had scraped it there was a redder rock underneath . I touched it , and a handful of powder and chalky chunks came away . They grew hot in my hand as I held them . My back was burning , and I realized the red dust had come away on my shirt where I had leaned . " You 're a mess , " Barbara said , as she dusted off my back with her hand . " This is hot ! " she said , and went quickly to the trailer to wash up . We found the canyon bottom in another hour , a small circumscribed arroyo , a miniature canyon : slabs of rock all around us , but a rough and flat area , enough room to pull the caravan off what remained of the road . Large boulders , many dead-end cavelike entrances into slabs at ground level and ones vaguely visible in shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . The Jeep , the Airstream , and my car , each were covered with a red dusting . It was so thick on the car 's windshield that I could n't see in at all . Though it was only four-thirty , we ate a light dinner . Melchior kept shifting in his seat , and Barbara reached to her neck often and rubbed it . It was too hot in the trailer , though now that the sun was sinking there was some relief , purer air and the remnant of a breeze outside . " I 'm stiff all over , " Melchior said . " And my neck 's killing me , " Barbara groaned.  |p162Melchior  worked at his sandwich with little enthusiasm . " Do you think maybe we can sleep outside ? It 's too close in here . " " We can try it , " Barbara said . " Maybe we can get the bed out . It unhitches for cleaning and such . " " The bunk comes out , " Melchior said . " How about a brandy ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the bottle . The three of us sat on a large stone boulder , drinking . Melchior could n't find a good place for himself and kept getting up and stretching . " Let 's look around , " he said finally . " I ca n't sit still . " We started out along the roadbed , hoping to find its exit and more open space , but when we had gone a few hundred yards we saw that there was no immediate end to the rock enclosure we were in . When we returned , Barbara was out of sight in the Airstream . We could hear the clatter of dishes . Melchior suggested we explore the rock itself a little , and we headed out again , in different directions . I found a spur that I had seen earlier , and decided to check it . In no more than a hundred yards I found the cave . It was set in the broad face of a slab of sheer rock . To the left of the slab wall the valley opened up and the road widenedand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spur had left the main roadway was too severe , and we would never have been able to get the car and Airstream around it , to get beyond rock that way . I had to climb over a pile of loose stones and small bouldersto get to the cave 's mouth , and as I went up I could tell that some of the rocky leavings were freshly turned , probablyshoveled from the cave itself to widen the opening or in search of something . Inside the cave the air was still , a little dank , and cooler . I could not see to the end of it , did n't have a light and had no idea how far back the opening went . A few feet in , where there was still enough light coming from outside to see , I found a piece of khaki strapping of some sort , a beer bottle , something that glimmered ( a piece of broken glass ) , and beside it a shell casing . There were freshp163shovel cuts in the cave 's floor and ones I took to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vicious-looking cuts , withoutapparent motive or any care in them . As my eyes becameaccustomed to the dark I went further in , and in a few feet I found a place where real , serious digging had been done . Here there were deep holes , excavations , but I found nothing but dirt and stone . On my way out , and near the fan of rock rubble that spilled from the cave 's mouth , I found a rough circle , darker red than the rock over which it washed . It flaked off at the corners when I touched it with a finger , bits of it getting under my nail . When I got below the spew of rubble , I saw another shell casing , this one still brassy and fresh . " I found a cave , " I said . We were back together again , standing beside the Airstream . " I found three of them , " Melchior said . " Somebody 's been fucking around . " " It 's the Anasazi , " Barbara said . " Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven hundred years ago or more . I read about them in the guidebook . " " The fucking shovel marks and beer bottles were n't , " Melchior said . Barbara laughed . " Did you find any shards and things ? " " I think I found some blood , " I said . It was a double bed , on a platform that was hinged at the center . We worked the mattress around the corners and managed with just a little trouble to get it through the door . The platform was easier , designed for such exit . We found a relatively flat place and set it up ; then while Barbara and I made it , tucking the sheets and blankets in , Melchior unhingedthe upper bunk and got it out as well . We found a slight rise for it ; it had no legs , and we figured to get it as close as possible to a level with theirs . When we had it in place it was ten or so feet away , slightly higher , and at an angle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Melchiorp164threw his arms up , laughed , then winced as the gesture caused pain in his tight shoulders . " That fucking wheel jumps a lot . " " Right , " I said . " But what about the pillow cases , sheets and blanket cover ? " Barbara stood behind Melchior , rubbing his neck and shoulders . She was slightly taller than he was and looked even larger , standing on a rock behind him . " His mother , " she said , smiling over Melchior 's shoulder at me . " She always wanted a girl . " The sheets and pillow cases matched the blanket cover , bold flower-figures in bright colors , with butterflies and golden bees among them . Some of the bees were sucking at the flowers ' cups , and there was a snail or two climbing up green stems . There was plenty of white space between the figures to set them off . There was not a single color on the fabric that was like those dour ones around us , and the bed seemed to glow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright light out to the shadows that were now lengthening on the dull red rock of the massive slabs around us . " This is almost like Bambi ! " Melchior said . " Or Flower and Thumper . " " I 'd say Dumbo , " Barbara said dryly , and we all laughed . Later , when the sun was almost gone but the bed still glowed , Melchior got a lantern out and placed it on a rock between our beds . Barbara showered in the Airstream and then Melchior and I did the same . They wore matching pajamas , but we were all too tired to joke about that . I wore a pair of loose cotton shorts and a light robe . It was still not completely dark , but it was darkening . There was not a single bug or moth around the lantern light , and just a hint of a breeze . I sat on the bunk bed , my bare feet on the rock beside it , knees almost to my chin , drinking a last brandy and smoking . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up behindp165his head . Both were lying on their backs on top of the blanket cover in their pajamas . " Would you like massages ? " I said . I spoke quietly , but my voice sounded loud to me in the still evening . " It might be good . " " That would be just swell , " Melchior whispered , and Barbara sighed . " I told you about that , did n't I , B. ? In San Diego ? " " You did , " she said . " I could sure go for that . " It was sweeter there and then than it was , this time , in memory . It had been practice in those early days with Melchior , my concentration then on anatomy : muscle groups , ligaments , and tendons . But the memory had its power , because I was learning then , was making the first steps into mastery , was beginning to understand purpose . I could have easily let it slide and been nostalgic . Melchior was really the first man I knew well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , felt in a strange way that I could not understand , that I knew her better than any other woman . Part of that , I was sure , was that there was not even a hint of sexuality between us , though with her I did n't wear the mask that Anson had provided me with for others . I think I loved her very purely . I know I wanted the feel of her body under my hands . I sat on my bed , smoking , drinking my brandy , and began talking . I spoke of The Heat , Melchior 's mother , that day of the trophy and the cake . I spoke softly , working to get at humor we could share gently . Just a few light chucklesand smiles . Then I turned to the past , the smokers in San Diego , then forward to Barbara 's meeting with Melchior . Somewhere in the talk , I moved over to them , helped them to take their pajamas off and get settled on their backs . I had gotten my bag from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found their places slowly , I got the bottles and towels out and put them on a level stone beside the bed . The sun was almost completely gone now , and the lantern seemed to glow brighter . There was its light , thep166glow still on the coverlet , late dusk light on the rock , the massive walls of red stone , only shadow figures forming a dark cathedral around us . Then they were doing the talking , reminiscing , telling me and each other tales of their time together , long and lazy stories without revelation , though containing bits of new understandings , nothing jarring , brief and minimal discoveries that when added up might come to something . I started with Barbara , time only for the back of her body ; we would need our sleep . And there was no flinching in her at all when I touched her , beginning with her feet and calves , the backs of her knees , the shapely large tendon of her lower thigh . Melchior lay on his back beside her , talking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . He did not look at me , but upward into the sky . When I lifted my head I could see that it was full of stars , was a ragged and brilliant circle outlined by the vague presence of the rock high above us . She groaned when I reached the backs of her upper legs , my finger edges brushing the fatty softness of her buttocks . She was no longer listening to Melchior 's story . It droned on softly , and though I picked out bits of it I was well into her and let him talk on for himself only , which seemed right and good . Her lower buttocks were like thick cream , but higher up , at the insertion of muscle at her hip cup and spine , there was a tightness that needed working . She opened her legs slightly , and I could see the strands of black hair in her crevice . When I reached her thin waist , her buttocks tightened , then relaxed as I got beyond her sensitivity . She was ticklish there , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I moved her , her legs closed slightly , touching my knee where I knelt between her thighs . The movement relaxed her spine , and that was clearly the reason for it . The wings of her scapulas had alreadyreceded when I reached them . Her face was buried in the pillow , and the pillar of her neck was smooth and without tension . My fingers touched her ears with oil as Ip167reached the apex of her spine , where it entered her skull . I touched the skull sutures through her still-damp hair . " Just for a few years , when I was a child , " she said , " we lived north , in Saint Paul , Minnesota , while it was still a manageable city . I had a girlfriend there with a tall , serious father ; I think now that she must have been a Swede . She told me a story about when her father was a child , what he used to do then , and why , around Christmas , they ate fish and how it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , on his stomach , and it was Barbara who was on her back , naked , her brown-tipped breasts evident in the starlight , mottled a little with shadowscast from the lantern . Melchior was silent now , and we were listening to Barbara . Hers was a more formal story , one to be heard and understood . I had Melchior 's thick thighs in my oil-slippery hands . The towels I had used to wipe Barbara down shone in the starlight on the low rock beside the bed . The flower and bee figures on the cover were dimmer but still apparent . One bee dipped his feet into the cup of a blue gardenia beside Melchior 's elbow . There were no sounds in the night at all , no bird or animal , only a light breeze , the shift of the lantern flame , and Barbara 's voice . I dug deeper , moving his muscular flesh , feeling the tributaries of blood flowing through it , his pulse , diastolic , pausing , constant . " As a child her grandfather had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , and landlocked as he grew up , he missed it , the flavor of holidays and what his own family did then . " Her father lived on a farm , far from the city , in his growing up , and the farm was near a small way station where the train that made its slow progress cross-country from east to west stopped briefly to take on water , a steam engine train . " In the winter , on the day before Christmas every year , as her father remembered it , his father would take him to the siding where the train pulled off for a few minutes.  |p168They  would stand calf-deep in the snow . The straight rails running out in both directions to the far horizon were no more than a slight rise in the earth , covered as they were by the white blanket , and they could see only the small snowcoveredwatering shed and a few spiky winter trees when they looked out over the empty expanse of whiteness . It was bitter cold , and their collars would be up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him . It was very silent , only the sharp clack of a few blackbirdsin the skeletal branches of the trees . " Then the train would come . They would see its approachfor a great distance , well before they could hear it . It was a white cloud only to begin with , as it kicked up snow from the drift-covered rails , plowing along . Then they 'd see the smoke , gray , rising out of the snow cloud . They 'd hear it , a rumble under their feet in the beginning , then the whistle , muted as it sounded in the billows and smoke . The man would come out of the watering shed then and wait with them , looking every so often to make sure the suspended hose was in the right position . Her father would step back a little as the train got closer . It looked much larger than it was , swollen in its snow cloud halo . Her grandfather always stayed put , waiting . " Then it was there , scraping and pulling up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spewing steam , coughing and blowing , a terrible racket , blackbirds in rollingsnow clouds , bare branches shaking , and then a deep sigh as it came to an idle and the water was pumped in . " They would go to the side of a boxcar , and when the door slid open , her father would see the blocks of ice , steam rising from them as the outside air entered , and the wooden box would be handed down to her grandfather . " Christmas Eve . Snow falling in heavy flakes out the dining room window . Grog and salted herring . And a large platter of fresh oysters , alive on the half shell , on a farm in the center of Minnesota , turn of the century . " But her story stayed with me because of another thing , something that happened a few years later , when I wasp169around twelve . We were visiting friends of my parents in Madison , Wisconsin . It was winter , though not Christmastime , and we were snowed in on their friend 's farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they took me out in the evening to smell the wood smoke from the chimney and watch it drift into the icy air . The man had met us in Madison , to guide us out to his place , and had made a stop at the small airport , where I saw him load a large refrigerator box into his car . Halfway out to his farm it had started to snow , and the last few miles it was a blizzard . We arrived around noon , and by six we could hardly see the curves of the cars under the drifts . When we had watched the smoke for a while , we went back into the house . All the adults were gathered around the large kitchen table , smiling and laughing , looking down at the ten small lobsters that were ready on the plates . The man had them flown in from Maine for the occasion of our visit . I remember the way the shells cracked , the smell of the seaweedthey had been packed in . Lobsters in a blizzard in Madison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thirteen years later , at a dance in Philadelphia , I met my love Melchior . He was drunk and in some disturbance or other , and I noticed the strange sense of goodwill in his drunkenness . He seemed to be only half in it , wanting to do vibrant and good things , but feeling that all he had to show for himself was his physical , farm-boy strength . He was familiarlyviolent with objects , pushing people around in his great strength with a smile on his face . Not angry at all , looking as if he wished to have similar feelings in sobriety . " They threw him out , and since the girl I had come to the dance with had taken up with a young man there , when I left to go home I was alone . And there was Melchior , sittingat the same bus stop bench I arrived at . We got to talking , and we have been talking ever since . " I think it was not a matter of love with us in the beginning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a romanticobject to be learned about , rounded out , and tamed.  |p170There  was never that progress into familiarity in which the one fallen in love with is changed from hero into husband or wife , faintly disappointing by comparison . But there is this story , and it says something about romance , about the past and nostalgia , and maybe it accounts for our good beginning . " On our first date , Melchior took me to the house of a black family for dinner . He knew the son from the Navy ; both of them had worked in the pharmacy , and the young man had asked Melchior over to meet his parents . " The mother of the young man was from Washington State and she still had family there , and one of them , her father I think , worked as a loader for some commercial airline . What he had loaded and flown out fresh for the family that very morning were giant crabs , right out of the water in Washington . We sat in North Philadelphia , in an Easterndining room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As fat as chickens , better than lobster , huge chunks of crabmeat dipped in butter . Melchior was smiling . He was very impressed with himself . It was a good beginning . " The last thing in this cycle happened after we were married and on the road one summer looking for graves . We were in Massachusetts , on Cape Cod . We got in late , a small town just below the tip . All the stores were closed , except for a small one , and that had been hit by the rush of weekend tourists and had very little left on the shelves . We settled for frozen pizza . We were staying in a small cottage-colony , a family business , and in the office I got the loan of some packaged hot peppers from the woman who owned the place . She inquired about our dinner , and I told her about the pizza . " I was just turning the oven on in the little kitchen , when I saw her walking toward our cabin from the office . She was carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could knock , and she reached the bag out to me with a smile . There was a pheasant in it . Scalded in a bucket and plucked , roast pheasant instead of frozen pizza our first night in.  | " I have no understanding of this story beyond the obviouslinks between its elements . It 's not so much a matter of incongruity as it is one of pleasure in surprise and then the experience , over long moments , of eating and talking . I ca n't help but think , though , that it 's a measure of how I came with my past to Melchior . He loved this story when I first told it to him . He figured that the crabs capped it , that the pheasant in Massachusetts was a kind of sweet coda . I guess I can see it that way too . " He had entered the stream of accident from my past . With the crabs he had been motivated to please me , somehowknowing in a way he could not really know that he could please me by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life before him . He liked to romanceit that way at least . The pheasant made him sure of it . Now he had two accidents that were like my two . Together , through my telling him about it , we had the four of them . " My , what a sweet tale , I think sometimes . Bringing the past this way into the present . Such accidents of the past . Maybe shad roe here in the wilds of Utah is another one . Surely the congruence of events that brought us together here is . Let 's say that the roe is too . " By the time I had finished with Melchior 's body , Barbara had finished her story and was deep in sleep . I lifted myself from their bed then , and by the time I had returned to my cot I could hear by his breathing , his faint snoring in the quiet night , that Melchior was asleep as well . He had listened to Barbara 's talk with a certain satisfied intensity , and at times , when I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the stars . I took another brandy , another cigarette , and sat at the edge of my cot , my feet on the now cool rock . How I enviedthem , I thought , realizing as I thought of it that it was an idea and not really a feeling . I had had a chance with Melchior too , with that drunkenness that Barbara had spokenof , but it had been too early for both of us then , or too late , and what it might have come to had it not been earlyp172or late was not at all clear to me . I knew that the way I turned and twisted my past was not the way Barbara had addressed hers in the story . I wanted to right something , to alter and correct ; her nostalgia was sweet and pure , tough in that she wished nothing from it but its accuracy . But there were analogues for me as well , though larger and vaguer ones : my marriage to Lorca , my time with Anson , relationships with men and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat as I realized that once again it was I who had been the agent for mild revelation , agent only and not participant . I flexed my fingers , pressed my feet down on the cool stone . It had been weeks since my last massage ; these had been thorough and careful ones , and my wrists and palms ached a little . I took hold of my own naked legs under the folds of my robe , but my hands could not feel formal enough . There was nothing , right then , that I could do for myself . I could only lie down , pull the blanketup over me , and go to sleep.  |p173It  was the feel of a light breeze stirring the hair on my leg , the heat on skin over which the hairs tickled , that woke me up in the morning . I must have kicked the covers off in the night , and when I rose to my elbows I saw my naked leg , half of it in shadow , bare to the thigh on the coverlet . Turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slabs around me , and when I glanced at the bed I could see how it shone in the rumple of flowered sheets , lighting the bee figures up . Barbara and Melchior were not in the bed , but just as I rose and put my bare feet on the cool , shaded rock to the side of my pallet , I heard them , laughter and what sounded like splashing . I got to my feet , slipped my shorts on , and followed the sounds . The pool was no more than fifty yards from our encampment . It was fed by a slow , narrow stream , three thinner tributaries running from it on the down side . Wep174must have missed it in our reconnoitering because it was around a tight corner , through a narrow gap in the rock , and because the stream that fed it was so level and quiet . The way to it led through the same red shale that surroundedour encampment , but the pool itself was formed in granite , very white and smooth . The splashing that I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their waists , Melchior chunky and pink , Barbara , her small breasts waving above the surface , darker , and just as happy . He was hitting the surface of the pool with his palms , splashing her for her pleasure , watching the water wet and then dry quickly on the white rock surrounding it . " David , it 's wonderful ! " Barbara said . " Warm on the surface , and cool , cool down below . " Her breasts elevated as she raised her arms in gesture , not a trace of modesty , false or otherwise in her clear eyes . " Come on in , man , it 's fine ! " Melchior said , and so I stepped out of my shorts and lowered myself into the warm and then cool water . " What have you been doing in here ? " I said . I had squatted a little , standing on the balls of my feet , lowering myself in up to my neck . I was looking between Barbara 's breasts . " Would n't you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little sheepishly behind me . The pool was big enough for four more people , but we stayed within arm 's reach of each other , changing places as we dunked our bodies and shifted to see the rock formationsrising close on all sides from different angles . There was a smooth ledge in one place , and we took turns sitting on it while the others splashed each other and threw water up into their own faces . I felt feet and knees brush against my own at times , but there was enough drift on the surface to keep it opaque , and I was never sure who they belonged to . There were small deposits of sand at various places near the lip of the pool , and we used handfuls of it to scrub each other 's backs . We must have spent an hour or more there ,  |p175and  when we got out and stood at the side in the air , I could see a faint aura of steam around Melchior and Barbara as the hot sun quickly evaporated the droplets of clear water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bristle and flex everywhere . I do n't think I ever felt more ready to begin a day . When breakfast was ready we decided to eat it outside , on a card table a good distance from the Airstream . Melchiorand I had folded up blankets and sheets , dismantled our two beds and worked them back inside , into their places . Then we brought out chairs and covered the table with a bright striped oilcloth . When we had set it with silver , cups , saucers and plates , we helped Barbara carry breakfast out . There was juice in a stone pitcher , fresh ground coffee with milk warmed for cafe con leche , scrambledeggs and sausage , toast and bagels , cream cheese , butter , and lox that Barbara had saved , tucked back in the bottom of the small refrigerator , as a surprise for Melchior . We lounged in our chairs , sipping the last of the coffee and talking when we were finished . It was seven-thirty in the morning by this time , and the sun was still soft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the high stone pillars , not yet shining full from above us . Shadows fell , hard-edged and large on the ground and stone , and some cut in across our table . It was an easy matter to move the head or arm a bit , when it grew a little too hot , to get the part into the cooler shadow . We talked about their son Paul a little , about the Airstreamand how much they were enjoying its amenities , the pleasure of the new Jeep . But mostly we spoke of the place we were in , the soundness of our sleep last night and the pool . Melchior wondered about the caves we had found , the source of the tire ruts running off into the distance , and Barbara told us more about the Anasazi . It seemed there were people called " pot hunters , " she said , who were runningthrough this state and adjoining ones , ripping these old caves off , taking what they could get of value . " It 's a real problem , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the caves . The space was just too big , and there had been violence . " A little like the Old West , " she said . " Gold rush . Valuable old pots and shards . " I thought of the dark , ragged circle I had found at the cave entrance and remembered what Karla had told me and the vessels along the wall in Sharonville . Melchior seemed ready to get more information about the Anasazi from Barbara , but he quickly let it drop as he looked at the stone rising around us . The way the light now lay on the massive red rock slabs was a better subject , and we picked out figures and faces on the rock 's surfaces , noted particular formations , and talked and joked about them . Once we had cleaned up after ourselves , put the table and chairs back inside and washed up the dishes , Melchior and Barbara got out brochures and maps and began studyingthem at the small kitchen table . Barbara seemed to be the real navigator , and I went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then sat on a rock for a last cup of coffee before we departed . I had a place in the shade , close to the rise of a broad wall of rock . I could feel the slight sunburn on my arms , how they and my legs under my pants were comfortably cool now that the sun had left them . I could not really understand yet how things had changed , my mood and the actual progress of events that had started well before I had entered Utah . Coming into Utah had at first seemed the real beginning of some kind of descent into a past of the kind the Bishop had spoken of so long ago , a place where I had literally never been , but one in which things might be revealed to me  --  Anson and Lorca , an understanding of myself through possible revelationsabout them . Now I thought back to Carl and Anne , realizing that the descent had started there and that I had begun to feel an edge of ominous and depressing expectation ever since my arrival in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that town beyond it as a kind of crossing , then the gates of entrance , and then that wasted and some/how frightening town of Anson 's origin , its emptiness and decay , motorcycles , dead tree stumps , and the cemetery . But then I had found Melchior squatting and rubbing the stone , and since then something in my spirits had lifted , a weight that I had not recognized in my arms had gone out of them as I had my hands and fingers in the oil , feeling the give and resilience of tissue as I massaged Barbara and Melchior under the stars . There were new things to deal with  --  the absence of Anson 's grave , the letter from Anne , the reconnection to Melchior again , his gravestone art . I had been watching him , trying to figure him out , but that had been lost in my quick awareness of his insouciance . I had come to believe that there was nothing that bothered him , not in the way at least that I was bothered ; his past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might have told me about it , both recently and in our years together in San Diego , seemed a book that was fully open to him . He had nostalgia , but of an appropriate kind , a kind that did not seem to prevent him in any way from going forward . He had Barbara , and I suspected that was the crucial thing . They were perfect together , whatever that might mean . And as I twisted these thoughts , extending their serpentinemaze , then turning them back on each other , fanning and constricting them , forgetting the rock I was sitting on , losing the feel of the cool shade , I recognized that it could be seen as a matter of syntax , at least as a symptom . They were direct about things ; she asking , he answering . She reminding , and he executing . Tasks at hand , whether ideas or the practical matters of activity . She was a wonder ; it was true . But they were also a wonder to me together . Had there been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in San Diego ? I remembered his tentativereaching as he searched through photos on the couch that day as we overlooked the city from the Palisades . I had thought it nostalgia of a kind that wished for reclamation , that needed , as I felt I now did , to discover something hiddenin the past , something to right the present . Now I sawp178that it was not that at all . It was discomfort born only of the desire to connect up with me in the present . It was a way into the present , begun from our only common ground at first . Had it been I that had asked him to bring the pictures out in the first place ? Was n't it I who had lingered too long in the past ? Once we had started out for The Heat 's trophy , it had gotten easier . Once we had things to do together in the here and now , our references to the past were centered , for Melchiorat least , though I was not at all sure about myself . Taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I had kept noting the changes in his body , his developed vocabulary , referring them constantly back to another time . I think it was Barbara who had brought me completely forward finally , brought me to that place where I could accuratelysee him as he was , now , in the present , and not as some aberration or mutant development of a truer self that I had known before . Did I think of myself as truer also ? What could I be now , then ? I was torturing the syntax again , but I held underneath that twisting the feel of the quickly relaxing sinews of Barbara 's body under my oily hands the night before . I had felt I 'd touched her in a perfectpresent then , that she had trusted fully in the knowledge that though the touch had sexuality in it , it was itself that completion . It led to nothing other than what it was . She had spread her legs to my touch not as an invitation , but for fulfillment . Her deep , quiet moans had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble getting our caravan around the tight turns that would take us beyond the immediate enclosureof those rock towers among which we had spent the night . At places the rock came up tight against the traillike road again ; there were no shoulders at all , and the road seemed even narrower than it was because the rock tended to taper in , hanging over us , until in places there was no more than a sliver of light entering a hundred or more feet above us . Melchior drove , and Barbara and I walked to the rear ofp179the caravan , calling out and directing as Melchior got too close to the rock . He had to back up at times , which was difficult with my car as a second trailer , and once we had to jack up the rear of the car and push it off the jack to shift it away from a protruding bulge of rock at a turn . The trailer had a long , dusty scrape along one side of it by the time we had gotten through . When Melchior wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was superficial , something that could be feathered out easily and spot-painted ; it had not gotten below primer to metal . The road straightened enough then , though rocks still came to the edge of it in places , and Barbara and I were able to get into the Jeep beside Melchior . By ten o'clock we were back into relatively open spaces and were beginning to climb slightly . There was still nothing but red rock , scrub of pinon , yucca , occasional juniper , sand and dry soil all around us . The sun was high , and it beat down brightly on the hood of the Jeep . We wore sunglasses , and Melchior wore a visor . It was a little too small for him , and we joked about the way he looked in it , though we all kept our eyes on the road and the strange landscape , the dead and primitivemoonscape through which we slowly traveled . " They say there 's wildlife here in the brochures , bobcats , coyotes , even black bears , but I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutal and barren . " " Maybe high , where the trees start , " Melchior said . There were plenty of birds though . We could see them when we leaned forward in the cab . They soared and roosted high up at the top of the rock slabs that we passed among , and some drifted down , almost to our level at times , in search of living things on the canyon floor . Barbara had marked up maps , and she held them in a ragged pile in her lap , fingering through them , opening and folding them back on themselves , studying and reconnoiteringas we moved slowly along . The roadway had widenedslightly , was twisting again , and when we came to spaces where we could see for some distance , we noted that the rock slabs and obelisks a long way off seemed to bep180sinking down into the earth as we rose to elevations that were almost as high as they were . The air cooled a fraction as we ascended , and I could feel it on my arm where it rested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in four-wheel drive now , had downshifted as the pitch of the incline increased . We made a turn around a pile of large red boulders and saw the first trees , greener than they really were , seen against the barrenness of the landscape that still surrounded us . They were mostly fir trees , tall and sinewy , growing very close together , sun filtering through their branches , making them look a little dusty . " This is Manti-La Sal , maybe , " Barbara said . " I do n't think so yet . " Melchior glanced over at her lap , then back at the road . " Could be it 's beginning , " I said . " I do n't know . " " The Beehive State , " Melchior said , gesturing to both sides of the Jeep . We were passing through a miniature meadow , no more than a brief dip in the road , a place of scrub growth , but with scraggly flowers , wild roses I thought , in places at the road 's edge . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' cups . The petals were pale pink , washed-out , but the bees were bright in their banded colors . " Could those be gardenias ? " Barbara said , pointing away from the roadside to a gathering beside a low rock formation . " I would n't bet on it , " Melchior laughed . " But they do look like our sheets . " " They are , " Barbara said . " Imagine ! " It was one o'clock now and we were still climbing . The red rock formations had given way completely , and we could see trees and other green growth in every direction . In the distance , in some places , the rock slabs were still visible , but our view of them was most often cut off by the tall firs . The sun was still overhead , but much of it was caught by the trees , softening it , and there was a cool breeze . I 'd brought my arm inside the cab , and Barbara had dropped a thin sweater over her shoulders . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive to the touch of air . In two more hours , by three o'clock , we had reached levelerground , but at a high altitude this time ; the firs had shrunk in size , were thinner , fuller as the spaces between them increased . We had come across a few other roads intersectingour own , raw new roads that headed off through the sparse terrain , then dipped and turned and disappeared . There was rock and moss on the ground now , patches of wildflowers here and there . We moved through small meadows that had trickling streams meandering through them . There were low rock formations in the distance , but they were white and gray now , no longer red and dusty . Barbara exclaimed at one point , calling out " sheep ! " but by the time Melchior and I had looked where she pointed there was nothing there . It was after a tight turn in the road , a slight dip as we moved down into a broad meadow where the road straightenedfor a few hundred yards , that we came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything man-made that we had encounteredsince leaving the town two days before , the first thing other than beer cans and rifle casings , and I felt the Jeep lurch , the weight of the Airstream and car behind us push ahead for a moment , when Melchior pulled his foot back from the pedal . He did n't touch the brake , but let us coast down the slight decline . The car was to the side of the road . The hood was up , and as we approached we saw the figure of a slight man leaning against the right front fender , facing the road . He heard us before he saw us . His head turned our way . Then he moved quickly around the front of the car and out of sight , blocked off from our vision by the raised hood . Beforewe got there he was back in sight again , this time edgingout into the roadway tentatively , raising his arm and hailing us . Melchior pumped at the brakes , slowly bringing the Jeep and the weight pushing behind it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear of the car , and Melchior engagedthe hand brake and got out . We watched him walkp182slowly to where the man stood , then the two of them went around to the front of the car , out of our sight . We could hear some talking and some tinkering , then we could hear nothing . We waited a few moments , and then I opened the door on my side , climbed down from the Jeep , and headed for the raised hood . Before I got there , Melchior and the small man rounded the car 's front again , and a third man , larger and behind them , came into sight as well . He was wearing bib overalls , dark blue , stiff and brandnew , and under them a white short-sleeved dress shirt . His hair was silver , combed back from his forehead in a tight pompadour . The legs of his overalls had ironed creases , razor sharp , down the front , and they were slightly belled and . a little short where they approached the tops of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shoes were black low-cuts , dress shoes with plain toes , and before my eyes traveled up from them and back to his round , flushed face , I knew , even as the thought of it disoriented me , that the Bishop had returned to Utah . " David , my son ! " he called out as I approached him . The flesh at the corners of his eyes creased as his mouth moved into a broad smile . " This is chance ! " he said , and he reached to the shoulder of the smaller man , urging him forward ahead of him . Melchiorshifted to the side to let them pass . " This is my friend Burl , " the Bishop said when he reached me . He put his free hand on my shoulder , pressed both of us , turning us toward each other , formalizing our introduction . " Burl , you remember , I told you about David ? " If it was chance that had brought me together with the Bishop again , chance of the same quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was nothing to be wondered at in it . But I knew it was not that , knew that the precipitator in our meetings had been myself , my own sad meanderings , and that they were growing away from that sadness as we had come together again , at least insofar as attitude was concerned . I was feeling better , atp183least in the new community of our traveling , though the quality and direction toward destination were still in question . I had not thought of Anson , or even Lorca , in many hours of the days now , and the oddness of that struck me fully as we worked on the Bishop 's car . I had headed into Utah for answers to both relationships , but once there it had become not future revelations that held me but the quality of immediate ones , relationships that in this place had a way of remaining jettisoned from the past . There was nothing for it but to leave the car . The coil had failed , and wires running from it had been burned away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caravan , of hooking the Bishop 's car to the rear of my own , then we pushed it off into the meadow , transferred the Bishop 's and Burl 's belongings to the backseat of my car , and locked theirs up and left it . " It 's a rental , " the Bishop said . " Let them come and get it . " The Bishop and Burl climbed into the Airstream . It was five o'clock and the sun was beginning to sink . Melchior pulled away slowly . We 'd decided we would drive on for only a little while , would look for a place where there was water , hopefully another meadow , a good place to spend the night . We drove on for a half hour , then found our meadow , one smaller and more cozy than the one in which we had discovered the Bishop , this one with a narrow stream running through it , fir trees at its perimeter , level ground covered with moss and occasional stones , larger boulders lining the stream 's edge in places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began , and it was a simplematter to pull our caravan out into the mossy surface . We got fifty yards from the roadway , among a stand of tall , thin aspens , before we stopped . The Bishop and I sat together , I on the ground , he in a folding director 's chair , among the aspens , no more than twenty feet from the Airstream . He had brought out a bottle , a full liter of the best Martell , from a leather case in which he carried quite a few of them . There was a place forp184large snifters in the case as well , and he had passed them around to all of us . Melchior , Barbara and Burl were sitting at a card table a good distance from us , playing canasta . Melchior had gotten the oil lamps ready , and one rested beside the leg of his chair , the other on a rock where the Bishop and I sat . Neither was lit . There was still light , though the sun was very low , only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had barbequed some steaks . Burl had soaked French mushrooms , then sauteed them with onion in oil , and while Melchior was tending the grate , wearing a blue butcher 's apron and a white chef 's hat , Barbara had made a salad from the one remaining head of lettuce , romaine , a Caesar salad , with egg yolk and packaged croutons . The Bishop had bottles of fine red wine in another case , and we had finished two of them among us . Burl brought out some mints when we were finished , handing them out like a waiter might , bowing and smiling . " Burl 's my boy now , " the Bishop said softly . " Well , long lost to me , not really a boy as we were once , but I 've given in to what was right with us . I might have lost it forever had I not returned . " He spoke softly , but there was a deep quiver in his voice , and I recognized the gravity of what he was saying , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I said . " No , I think not , my boy . No , I wo n't . I 'll call in , in a while . I 'm sixty-three now , David . Soon enough for retirementin my order and position . They 'll not like it much , having to work things out with so little advance notice . But I 've kept my affairs in good order , and there 's nothing really that they can do about it . No . I wo n't go back . " " How did it happen ? " We could hear Burl 's high chuckle , Barbara joshing him as he made his bid . " Not really too long a story , " the Bishop said . He still wore his overalls , but he had put leather slippers on and had changed from the starched white shirt to a light-blue chamois one with long sleeves . His hair shone in the fil/tered light , and I could see the touch of redness at the edge of his eyebrows where he had recently plucked them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole thing lit up for him in his mind again , and he was shocked at the depth of his immediate sadness and disorientation . Cora was dead , and with the end of her life that strain of his past that had revealed and changed the way he saw himself years ago was now in its way permanent in its alteration . The diorama might turn  --  there was still Burl  --  but its turning could only be attenuated now , creaky , and difficult . He could no longer entertain , even in that small recess below thought , the going back , the reseeing of things again ; it had been his secret wish , revealed to him and then denied forcefully after he had rehearsed the story , for the first time in close to ten years , that evening under my hands in the grotto . Dead in her sleep . And her illegitimate daughter , Patty , who had remarkably been in New York City only a few months earlier and had taken the body of a dead one back with her to Utah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ) , had found his name many times in Cora 's diary , his address in her slim book . They would bury her near Nativity . The town had changed , but this was her desire : to rest in the old cemetery near the school . He recognized in the letter the name Anson , remembered its source in a while . Would he be buried in the same cemetery ? What was the connection to Cora 's mother ? Worlds within worlds , he had thought , but the torquing irony of that glibness could not save him from anxiety and wonder . It was Burl only now , and he was twisted again into thoughts of possible reclamation . He would be going to Utah again . He would visit Cora 's grave , he would look for Anson 's , and though he did not note it , he knew too that he would try to search out Burl . " I made my way to Nativity uneventfully . The state of the place was of course shocking . They had beshitted the exterior walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude homesteading in classrooms and chapel.  | " I found Burl at the seminary . It is not too far from the town , and though it too is merely a shadow of what it once was , there 's still a kind of skeleton crew there , a few priests , some workers to keep the grounds in reasonable shape . Burl kept the financial accounts up . It was really makeworkfor him . He had been living there for ten years , having given up the secular life shortly after our encounter uponmy return to Nativity , the one I told you about that evepingin the city , in my grotto . He had drifted for a while after that , selling things still , but slowly extricating himselfThe town itself was like another place entirely . But youcan imagine my shock . All those tall dead trees , boarded up houses , a wasted environment . It was once thriving , a decentenough town . Utahfrom his accounts . Then he had just walked away from it , begged entrance to the seminary . It 's a sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What was it that he sold ? " " Oh , high fashion clothing . Things to buyers in expensivedepartment stores and such . " Burl was dressed in loose slacks and a flowing satin shirtof the same color . He wore tan Italian shoes , a silver identificationbracelet loose at his wrist , and a purple scarf to theside of his neck , the broad tails draped over his shoulder . Ifollowed the Bishop 's eyes as he looked over at him whilespeaking . He saw us watching and lifted his arm and hand in a wave . We waved back , and we could see his teeth shine as he smiled . " He seems relaxed enough , " I said . " Not at all as I remember from your storY . " Now he is , " the Bishop said . " I 'm more relaxed too , David . " I recognized that that was true . Creases that I remembered in his face , a certain tightness in speech and movementa slight slump in posture even in his severe clerical clothing , all these were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words that seemed gleaned fromp187reading , but he now used them with more comfort and a certain irony . They were parts of another language , one that he was giving up as the growing awareness of his new freedom became part of him . " Is he your lover ? " I asked , lifting the snifter to my lips and lowering my eyes , giving him time . There was a pause , an extended moment in which we could hear the twitter of the first night birds , just a few notes , distinct , with spaces of silence all around them . " Ah , David , " he said . " We may be too old for that . I do n't know . But I admit , I hope not . Time will have to tell . That I have found him again , can possibly right something  --  that is my measure , at least for now . " I felt that itch in my fingers , hearing him say these things . Intimacy , and so I yearned to touch flesh again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathology , the desire for possession that was control and not possiblyintimacy at all . I thought of Anson and what might have been my own missed chance . There was nothing possiblewhere he was concerned now . Could there be a chance with Lorca should I find her ? What would I be finding if I did so ? She had left me so long ago , and I was not sure I had any real idea of what she had been then or would be now . But it was the same , I supposed , with the Bishop and Burl . The Bishop too had felt he 'd lost him beyondreclamation . He 'd said , as I remembered , that he 'd forgotten him completely until he 'd gone back and at the reunion come upon him . Maybe I had still a ways to go beforediscovery . It came to me that I was already discovering things . I could give no names to them yet , but I was learning . First Melchior and Barbara , now the Bishop and Burl  --  possibly the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fingers stretched and began sweating , though the Bishop was going on now with the details of his story without my touching him . " So we had lunch together at a picnic table under a raggedold awning in the yard of the seminary . And we talked ,  |p188and  before we knew it Burl was packing his things . I found this clothing in the one open shop in the town when we got there . I changed out of my clerical garments in the car . What Burl has on are things he has had for years , but he has never before worn them beyond the privacy of his rooms . " We went to the cemetery and stood at the foot of Cora 's grave there . The earth still had that fresh turned look to it . I tried in what phone booths I could find in the town , but all the books had been ripped free of their chains . When I did find one , back in the store where I had purchased this clothing , Patty 's name was not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we could not find it there . We left the town , uncertain wanderers really . We were going nowhere , just getting placed in the new somewhere of our being together again . Then our car broke down and you came upon us . We must have traveled by another road . Surely we would have met earlier otherwise . And the terrainyour friends spoke about was nothing at all like what we passed through on our way . " The revelations of the connection between Anson and the Bishop , the fact of the three women , grandmother , mother , and daughter , came to me with less shock than I would have imagined after I heard it . The Bishop was talkingloosely and freely , and when the facts came , they came as just part of a gathering of details , of equal value with the rest mentioned . He said that Patty had noted in her letter that she 'd had no trouble keeping up with Anson , had traced him easily through fashion magazines . She 'd been in the city on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent one , in the Times . She had held on to her grandmother'swish for many years . She was the only other familythat she had . And so she had come and taken Anson away , returned him again to Utah . There was a hint , the Bishop said , of a rift between Cora and her mother . It had been Patty who had held the tenuousfamily together.  | " She wrote a lot , " I said . " As much about her grandmotheras her mother ? " " That 's true , actually . I suspect with both of them gone she needed to hold them together , hold herself together . " " Is it possible that she still lives in that town ? The place seems very wrong for that . " " Well , I doubt it , " he said . " I suspect that she only buried Cora there because it was home , home for her mother that is . The letter was postmarked elsewhere , anothertown that I did not recognize , though also in Utah . I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I had no name to go by . " " It was Maudie , " I said . He lifted the snifter to his lips and tipped it back . Then he rested it on the rock between us , took up the bottle , and refilled both of our glasses . The game at the card table had grown quiet and more casual . Melchior had lit his lantern , and its glow washed across the players ' arms and the fans of their cards . I took a match and lit our own , placing it on the rock to the side of our glasses and the brandy bottle . " What will you do now ? " I said . " Go with you for a while , if you 'll have us . We 're in no rush to get elsewhere . We 're just getting used to each other in this new way . It 's lovely here , not at all as it was below in that red rock . If you have room for us , that would be good . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . The bed and cot came out , and we unhooked two of the other bunks for the Bishop and Burl , putting them next to each other , no more than a few feet from our own . Barbara and Melchior went to the river to bathe , and then the Bishop and Burl did the same , separately . I heard the Bishop laughing to himself when he came back . There was a twinkle in his eyes and a certain shyness . He had a large white Turkish towel wrapped around his girth and he wore only his leather slippers . " David , " he said . " It has been a considerable length ofp190time , my boy . Do you think I could prevail upon you ? " I knew what he meant , and I smiled as he approached me . " Burl , too ? " " No , no , I do n't think so . Too modest for that . Am I right , Burl ? " He was sitting on the edge of his cot , a few feet away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for bed . " Yes , yes , you 're right , Father , " he said in a high , shy laugh . " My time will come though , I assure you . " The Bishop laughed and nodded . " You do n't know what you 're missing , Burl ! " It was Barbara , standing in the narrow doorway of the Airstream . We saw Melchior 's smiling moon-face over her shoulder . " She 's right about that , my man , " Melchior said , and then we were all laughing . It had grown dark now , and only the lights of the lanternslit up our encampment . They gave a bright glow , and it was easy to find our way among rocks and trees . The moss was soft and spongy under our slippers , and in the lantern light it looked like a thick green carpet . Melchior and Barbara went to their bed and sat down on it in their matching pajamas , gray ones with narrow white stripes and little emblems on the pockets . They still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tape on the recorder in the Airstream and had opened the windows on our side of the trailer . The music was turned down softly , Miles Davis 's " Sketches of Spain . " Burl lay on his cot with his arms over his head on the pillow , looking up through branches of the trees , into the bright stars that were just beginning to come out . His snifter sat on a low rock within easy reach . The Bishop lay on his stomach , the bright white towel , shining in the lantern 's glow , covering his hips and buttocks . And I was astride him , bending forward slightly , my hands slick with oil again , my fingers beginningthat push into tissue , those movements that wouldp191take him to a kind of recovery , but only that right and inconsequentialone , the one of refreshed muscle and sinew , after a day of bodily movement and long periods of sitting that he was unaccustomed to.  |p192We  rose quite early in the morning , washed in the river at first light , then packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his new , jovial self , which was like the old one , but touched with a new freedom of gesture , a loose informality . He joked with Burl , and Burl was more talkative then the day before , giving back to the Bishop in equal measure . It was good to see them together , the one robust and bold , the other still a bit tentative in the wilds , but smiling and enthusiastic in his willingness to learn as he helped with the packing up . Melchior taught him the turns that the mattress needed to get through the narrow door , and it was Burl who helped Barbara with the light breakfast she was preparing and who set the table . I watched the Bishop help Melchior check out the vehicles  --  oil , tires , hitches , and various other inspections  --  in preparation for our departure , and I was warmed to see thep193pairings that were bringing us together as a community . We were five wanderers out of multiple pasts now , but connected together for me because of my own singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to introduce them to the pleasures of each other 's company . By seven we were back on the road . Melchior had moved gear from the small backseat of the Jeep to the Airstream , and though it was crowded , there was room for Burl and Barbara there . Melchior , the Bishop , and I sat abreast in the front . Barbara kept most of the maps , and she and Burl examinedthem with their heads together , pointing , tracing out faint , broken road-lines , naming places . The Bishop had one in his hands in the front . " This is quite useless , " he said after studying it for a while . " You 're right about that , " Barbara said . " Where we are just is n't there . " " We 'll go along , " Melchior said . " This one seems pretty good . It got us together anyway . " " But just where is it that we 're going ? " Burl said . Barbara laughed . " I 'm not sure we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relatively gentle in its climbingturns , enough shoulder , and growth far enough back from its edges to let the width of the Airstream through without too much brushing and scraping . But then , as we continued to climb and the sun reached up to the tips of the low trees , ruts began to develop , with good-sized stones and rocks in them , and the road itself narrowed ; larger boulders and trees began to creep to the edges of it . There were tight turns and twists again , and we heard the dull thuds of things shifting in the Airstream . " Is it secure ? " Burl said , a note of concern in his voice . " Oh , sure , " said Melchior . " It 's all tied down or in locked drawers and cabinets . " Just then we heard the distinctsound of something falling and clattering . " Dishes from the shelves , I bet , " Barbara said . " Thank God they 're plastic . We better check it . "  |p194Melchior  pumped the brakes until we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . The road was now in a cut between large boulders and trees , and Barbara had to sidestep to get to the door of the Airstream . Burl went with her while the three of us stood at the hood of the Jeep , bending and stretching . They were back in a short time . It had been just the dishes , a loose latch . Everything else seemed in order . " I think I better check up ahead , " Melchior said . We all looked up the road as he stepped away from us . There was a tight turn about fifty yards away and we could not see beyondit , but we could see that the road got even narrower there , trees leaning in over it , one large rock formation extendinga bit out into it . The Bishop and I moved after Melchior , walking quickly until we caught up with him . " You 'd better think about changing shoes , " I said as we moved along . The Bishop was still wearing his overalls and I could see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped a bit in ruts . Leather soles , I thought . " I know it , " he said . " These are good only on carpets and city streets . I 've a pair of roughhouse ones among my belongings . They 'll need breaking in . " Beyond the turn , the road ascended at an acute angle , disappearing over a ridge in the distance . The ruts were rougher and deeper in its climb . It looked difficult and I was not sure that we could make it . " I do n't think we can make that , " Melchior said , shaking his head . He had his hands on his hips , looking up the road , then to the left and right . " What 's that up there ? " he said , " on the left . " There was what looked like a break in the trees where he pointed . " Another road , I suspect , " the Bishop said . " Let 's check it . " And Melchior moved off again . Even on foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the break in the trees that we would have some real trouble negotiating the climb to the turn and beyond . The ruts grew deeper as we climbed ; there were rounded rocks the size of a man 's head at various places in them.  |p195Rock  protruded out into the roadway , hard and with sharp edges . The break was indeed another road , broader and in bettershape than the one we were now on . It ascended , but its climb was gradual and we could see up it for a good distance . There seemed to be no rock overhangs , no trees of consequence . Melchior stood at the entrance , checking the angle of turn into it . He nodded after a while , indicating that he thought we could make the turn . It took us an hour to get up as far as the entrance onto the road . We got caught in deep ruts , had to back up , remove large rocks , and twice we had to use Melchior 's old folding army-shovel to dig our way out . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once we had made the turn and had all of our twelve wheels on the new roadway , we stopped and took turns at the Airstream bathroom to wash up . The Bishop went to my car and changed his shoes , and Burl got into rougher clothing . We were silent for the next hour , worn out from the effortof getting our caravan onto the new roadway . We watched as Melchior constantly moved his hands , steering , shifting down , negotiating sharp turns . The road had begun to climb along a developing ridge . Where there had been meadows and forest to our left , the land had begun to fall away , had become a steep decline of rock and brush , the floor of a valley in the far distance below us . To our right there was only rock now , rising sheer and vertical to a height we could not see or measure . " We 're in a little trouble , " Melchior said softly . I thought he meant the terrain , for we had rounded a turn to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer as the rise to our right , the road now even narrower , with no shoulder at all , only the drop-off no more than a few feet from our tires . " Gas , " he said . " It 's reading empty . We 'll have to siphon . I hope to hell there 's some in yours , David . " He opened the door to get out , looked down , then closed itp196again . " I do n't think that way 's good . " Even from my side of the cab , I had seen nothing but empty space when the door was open . I tried opening my own door , but it hit the rock and there was no room to slide through . " The back window , " Burl said . " I 'll go . " " Wait , Burl ! " But it was only a reflex of concern . The Bishop could see as well as the rest of us how narrow thewindow was . Only Burl was thin enough , small enough , to squeeze through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the ladder to the roof of the Airstream and out of sight . He came back in ten minutes with the gas can . It would n't fit through the rear window , and he had to climb to the roof of the Jeep and pass it down the side to Melchior'sextended hand . Melchior got it adjusted , turning it in the air outside the window , and Burl climbed back in . Then , with the Bishop holding his belt and I holding my arms around the Bishop 's ample waist , Melchior opened the door and got the can in position at the gas cap . He had to lean well out to get it to Barbara . She had kneeled on the rear seat cushion and had her arms out the window . She removed the cap and reached even further out , taking the bottom rim of the can , elevating it as Melchior held its handle . It was tricky , and some spilled . We could smell it vaporize in the air . But she managed to get most of the two gallons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least . When the operation was finished , the can sat on the seat in the back between Burl and Barbara . The drop to our left remained constant as we climbed , and after a while Melchior remarked that we must be very high up now . He could see clouds over the cliff edge at our left , a good distance down , hanging over and obliterating what might be there . Barbara could see them too , from herplace in the backseat , on Melchior 's side of the Jeep . " I see them , " Burl said , leaning over Barbara to look out the window , his hand on her shoulder . There was nothing but sheer rock on both sides now . The road was serpentine , with constant turns that prevented us from seeing very far as we ascended.  |p197Melchior  drove at a snail 's pace . The air was still , but it was crisp and dry . We knew by the sharp shadows the sun made on the rock around us that we were very high up ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat shimmerat the shadows ' edges . We watched the gas gauge . It had moved only a fraction when we 'd added the fuel , and we saw it slipping back into the red zone . Melchior kept the Jeep in low gears . The engine was laboring , the valves pinging a little in our steep ascent . We were alert to the possibility that was now becoming a certainty . There would be no gas stations ahead . There was nowhere to turn around , no road had led off this one since we had entered it . " I hope you care for a little stroll , Burl , " the Bishop said , and though we laughed at his dry humor , our laughs were hollow . From our vantage in the Jeep , we felt both the openness and the enclosure , the sheer rock on either side , the slight giddiness of being so high up and on the brink of a fall into the tops of clouds over the precipice no more than a yard from the Jeep 's side . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Airstream with it . We could wind up like the whip of a small train dragged from some high trestle . My imagination played with such things , and I was really wishing that the Jeep would begin to cough soon . Then it did cough , a brief choking sound and a lurch . Then nothing . Melchior set the hand brake , looked over at me , shrugged , and gave the key a turn . The starter ground , but there was no hint of a spark at all . " Sooner than I would have thought , " he said . " Can you get out that side , David ? " I was able to get the door open this time . With luck , we had stopped at a place where a shallow crevice in the rock face allowed for it . We were able to stand together outside the door , but we had to make our way up the ladder to the roof of the Airstream to get back to my car . We hugged to the rock incline as we walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the open air to the other side , that strange beckoningof the fall down hundreds of feet to the tops of thep198clouds . I tried to look out , rather than down , but the clouds kept drawing me . The roof of the Airstream was slick and slightly curved , and even though we inched along close to the rock rise , our hands extended and touching it , we could see hundreds of feet below the cliff 's edge . The clouds were thick and bluish , storm clouds , and I thought it must be raining under them . We were in clear , crisp air , and the earth far below us seemed like another , stormy , world entirely . Barbara was behind me . I felt her touch my back from time to time . I could hear brief sounds in the throats of the others . We did n't lift our feet , but slid them along the slick roof . There was room on the rock-wall side of my car , and when we reached the ground again , we were able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the pack I had from the trunk , and Burl and the Bishop gathered the things that they had that could be of use . I saw the Bishop slip a fresh bottle of Martell into the one canvas shoulder bag that they had between them . " It will be good to have this evening , " he said . " Even out of the bottle . " We made our way back to the Airstream , and Melchior broke one of the rear windows , got the latch open , and carefully hoisted Barbara in . She was gone for a while ; we saw the trailer shift a little with her movements . Then she returned to the window and began handing things down . When she was finished , Melchior helped her out , and we all went to the rear of my car again and packed the three knapsacks that we had between us . The Bishop 's canvas shoulder bag was small , but he was able to press clothing and some cooking implements into it . When we were ready , we crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . After fifteen minutes of climbing , stumbling , and huffing in the thin air , we began to notice the flowers . It was Barbara who saw them first , just a few , growing out of crevices in the rock face itself.  | " What can those be ? " she said , but they were too high above us to get to easily and we continued on . " City flowers they look like to me , " Burl said , and the Bishop nodded in agreement . He had his roughhouse shoes on now , high-top climbing boots with a fresh shine on their new leather . Then we turned a corner in the road and came upon more of them . They were growing in what soil there was on either side of us now , and in profusion , and there were numerous bees gathered around them , flying lazily , dippinginto cups , loading their feet with pollen . On the cliff side of the road , the flowers leaned out over the edge , movinga little in the downdraft , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought back from below the cliff to grab at petals and buds . " Like the sheets , " Melchior said . " God , yes . It 's unbelievable ! " Barbara said , going over to a pair at the rock wall . " They 're gardenias for sure . Blue ones ! " " Look over there ! " Melchior said . He was pointing ahead of us and to the right , to a place no more than fifty yards in the distance where the sun shone in flowers on the bare rock face . There were thousands of flowers . They covered the sheer incline in the shape of a large arch that was close to twenty feet high at its peak . I could not imagine how they could have grown wild there . The ragged flower-lined edges of the arch were too symmetrical and intentional . We moved quickly on , and when we reached within a few feet of the arch , we saw that the road we were on ended a few yards beyond it . It ended oddly and abruptly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , closing it off , ending and climbing to a great perpendicular height at the cliff s edge to our left . We turned from it , standing in front of the flower wall now , and then we saw that it was indeed an archway , an entrance into the rock face . The flowers hung out into the opening , and one would have to brush against them to get through . The petals that edged out intop200the space were translucent at their tips . There was light emanating from within them , a faint glow from a source far beyond us , something deep in the very rock itself . Burl squatted down a little and peered in . " I ca n't see the end , " he said . " But it 's a tunnel . " He turned on his haunches and looked up at us . " Let 's go , " he said . " Right . There 's nothing else for it , " the Bishop said , and we all nodded to one another . There were smiles on Barbara'sand Melchior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my own . I was not sure what I was smiling about , but I was the first one to squat down a little and creep into the low entrance of the archway . The going was easy , the floor of the tunnel level and clear of large stones , the walls smooth and without protuberances , and in only a few feet I was able to stand up to my full height . The tunnel turned , but gradually , and I could hear the four others , breathing easily now , as they moved in behind me . We went on for a full twenty minutes . The walls remainedlit with the glow we had seen at the entrance , and there was nothing to make us pause or consider . Melchior whistled a few random notes at one point , hearing the echo come back to him , but the sound was inappropriately loud , and he left off immediately . Then the tunnel made its final turn , and we could see the duplicate of the archway where we had entered in the distance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light vacant and empty of objects  --  nothing but a wash of blue . Then something white and soft-looking passed from one side to the other , and we realized it was a cloud and that we were looking into the sky . When I arrived at the archway , I stepped out on what proved to be a broad stone ledge at its entrance and waited for the others to join me , looking back into the tunnel . It was only after we were together , in a tight gathering on the ledge , that we looked downward . " God ! " Barbara said . " What can this be about ? " There was a small valley below us , no more than fiftyp201acres in size , I judged , surrounded on all sides by the steep rock face in which the tunnel had made its exit . We were high up above the valley , but the air was so clear that the cabins that formed a rough circle around the perimeter seemed much closer than they really were . We could see the burls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the texturesin limbs of fir and aspen growing around them . At places , the steep surrounding wall of rock had cut-backs in it , deep cul-de-sacs of miniature meadows in which there were other cabins , set deeply back . We could see bits of roof ridges , places where trees had been cut down , small cultivated paths . At the very end of the valley , directly across from us , there was a thick stand of fir trees , the beginning of a small forest . The sun cut a broad stripe of light across the valley 's empty center , but the forest was in completeshadow . I thought I saw the symmetrical edge of a structure deep among the forest trees , well back into them , but I could n't be sure of it . " Here 's a pathway , " Burl said . And we all moved to the side of the ledge and saw the cuts in the rock , the foot places , and then the dirt trail that meandered back and forth as it descended down the rock face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rock ; the trail was narrow and steep , but the decline was less severein its pitch as we descended , and the going got easier . In no more than ten minutes we reached the edge of the valley floor , coming out onto it at the side of a cabin . I glanced in a window as we passed , seeing furniture edges , but no human movement . Then we got beyond its side and moved out into the valley proper . We came closer together as we reached open space , becoming a tight little crowd . I felt shoulders touch my own , hands brush against fabric . The place seemed peaceful enough , but there was somethingvaguely ominous in its complete emptiness of human activity . A few songbirds sounded , but there was no other animation at all . Then I heard a tentative scraping sound in the distance to my left . I looked that way , squinting in the sun , **25;15138;TOOLONG parted . " I 've wanted you here . I ca n't tell you how much or how often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face . Along his jawline was the beginnings of his beard . Beneath , just above where his pulse beat , the skin was smooth . " You can show me . " When he grinned , she discovered she was relaxed and waiting for him . His experience might have been greater , but his need was n't . Hers had been under tight control and was ripe and hungry now that it was set free . They rolled over the bed , damp and naked , forgettingthe civilized , the ordinary . The spread rumpled and tangled beneath them . He swore at it , then pulled her free and on top of him . Her breasts were small and pale . He cupped one then both in his hands . He heard her murmur of pleasure as he watched her eyes close with it . Then she was pullinghim to her , and her mouth was like a fever . His intention to treat her as a lady , with care and gentleness , was abandoned when her arms and legs wrapped around him . Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a woman as passionate and demanding as any man could want . Her skin was soft , fragile to the touch , but slicked with desire . He skimmed his tongue over it , thirsting for her . She arched against him , letting needs , fantasies , passions have their way . Here and now were all that mattered . What was outside was removed , distant . He was real , and vital , and important . The rest of the world could wait . Candlelight flickered , gutted , and went out . Hours later , he awoke , cold . The spread was bundled at the foot of the bed . Tess was curled in a ball beside him , naked , her hair curtaining her face . He rose and pulled the covers over her . Even the moonlight was gone now . For a while he just stood over the bed , looking down at her as she slept . The cat padded into the room as Ben walked quietly out.  |p101DOCTORS  AND COPS . THOSE in either profession knowthey will rarely have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They understand that they 've chosen a career where the divorce and burnoutrates are high , the demands many , and the emotional toll extreme . Phone calls spoil dinner parties , sex , and sleep . It 's part of the job description . When the phone rang , Tess reached over automatically . And picked up a candlestick . On the other side of the bed Ben swore , knocked over an ashtray , and found the phone . " Yeah , Paris . " In the dark he ran a hand over his face as if to wipe away sleep . " Where ? " Instantly awake , he switched on the lamp . The cat curled on Tess 's stomach growled a complaint then leaped aside as she braced herself on her elbows . " Keep him there . I 'm on my way . " Ben hung up the phone and stared at the light sheen of frost on the window . " He did n't wait , did he ? " The light fell harshly over his face as he turned to look at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were hard  --  not weary , not regretful , but hard . " No , he did n't wait . "  | " Do they have him ? " " No , but it looks like we 've got a witness . " As he rolled out of bed he grabbed his jeans . " I do n't know how long I 'll be but you can wait here , get some more sleep . I 'll fill you in when . . . What are you doing ? " She stood on the opposite side of the bed , dragging on her sweater . " Going with you . " " Forget it . " His legs disappeared into the jeans , but he left the pants unsnapped as he pulled open a drawer for a sweater . " There 's nothing you can do at a murder scene but get in the way . " In the mirror above his dresser he saw her head snap up . " It 's still shy of five , for Christ 's sake . Go back to bed . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned . She wore only the sweater that skimmed her thighs . He remembered the material had been thick and soft when he 'd drawn it off of her . Her slacks were balled in her hands and her hair was rumpled from the pillow , but it was the psychiatrist facing him , not the woman . Something inside of him curdled . He yanked his own sweater on , then walked to the closet for his shoulder holster . " This is a homicide . It 's not like going to look at somebody 's who 's been painted up nice to lie in a casket . " " I 'm a doctor . " " I know what you are . " He checked his gun , then hitched the holster on . " Ben , it 's possible I could see something , some detail that would give me a clue to his mind . " " Fuck his mind . " Saying nothing , she shook out her slacks , stepped into them , then fastened them in place . " I understand how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He sat down to pull on his boots but continued to watch her . " You think you know how I feel ? Well , let me tell you anyway . There 's a dead woman a few miles from here . Somebody put a scarf around her neck and pulled until she could n't breathe anymore . She 'd have kicked and pulled at the scarf with her hands and tried to scream , but she would n't have been able to . So she 's dead , butp103she 's not a name on a list yet . She 's still a person . For a little while longer she 's still a person . " She would have reached out to him if she 'd thought there was a chance he 'd accept it . Instead she fastened her belt and kept her voice neutral . " Do n't you think I understand that ? " " I 'm not sure you do . " They studied each other a moment longer , each dedicated , each frustrated , each coming from different backgrounds and beliefs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either go with you now or I call the mayor and end up five minutes behind you . Sooner or later you 've got to start working with me . " He 'd just spent the night with her . He 'd poured himself into her three times during the night . He 'd felt her body rock and buck and shudder . Now they were talking murder and politics . The femininity , the softness , even the shyness he 'd taken to bed were still there , but beneath was a core of toughness , a self-possession he 'd recognized from the first . Studying her , he saw she would go no matter what he said , what he did . " All right . You go with me and get an up-close look . Maybe afteryou see her , you 'll stop letting your heart bleed for the man who did her . " She bent for her shoes . The bed was between them , but it was as if they 'd never shared it . " I suppose it 's no use reminding you I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wallet and shield , and said nothing . Tess saw her earrings on his nightstand , a little thing of great intimacy She scooped them up and dropped them in her pocket . " Where are we going ? " " An alley near Twenty-third and M. " " Twenty-third and M ? That 's only a couple of blocks from my place . " He did n't bother to look at her . " I know . " UHF STREETS WERE DESERTED . The bars would have closed at one . Most private parties would have waned by three . Washingtonp104was a political town , and though its night spots ranged from the elite to the sleazy , it did n't have the energy of a New York or Chicago . Drug deals around Fourteenth and U were a life-style away . Even the hookers would have called it a night . Now and then the leaves that had fallen rushed along the sidewalkthen stopped , victims of the sporadic wind . They drove past blank storefronts and boutiques with neon sweaters in the windows . Ben lit a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the tension . He did n't want her there . Doctor or no doctor , he did n't want her to be a part of the hopeless ugliness of this part of his job . She could share in the paperwork , the fitting together of the puzzle , the step-by-step logic of an investigation , but she should n't be here . She had to be here , Tess thought . It was time to face the results , and maybe , just maybe , get a better understanding of the motivation . She was a doctor . It was irrelevant that she was n't the kind of doctor who prodded fingers in the human body . She was trained , she was capable , and she understood death . Tess saw the blue and red lights of the first police car and began to school her breathing to long inhales , slow exhales . The alley and several feet on all sides were roped off , though there was no one on the predawn streets . Cruisers sat with their lights blinking and their radios on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben pulled up to the curb . " You stay with me , " he told Tess , but still did n't look at her . " We have a policy against civilians wanderingaround homicide scenes . " " I do n't intend to get in your way . I intend to do my job . You 'll find I 'm as good at it as you are at yours . " She pushed open her door and nearly collided with Ed . " Sorry , Dr. Court . " Her hands were icy . He patted them without thinking . " You 're going to want your gloves . " He stuck his own in his pockets as he looked at Ben . " What have we got ? " " Lab boys are in there now . Sly 's getting pictures . Coroner 's en route . " His breath came out in a white puffy steam . The tips of hisp105ears were already red from the cold , but he 'd forgotten to button his coat . " Some kid stumbled across her about four-thirty . Uniforms have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty busy whooshing up about a half case of beer . " He glanced at Tess again . " Sorry . " " Do n't apologize , " Ben said briefly . " She 'll remind you she 's a doctor . " " Captain 's coming in on this . " " Terrific . " Ben shot the butt of his cigarette into the street . " Let 's get to work . " They started toward the alley , passed a cruiser where someone sat in the backseat sobbing . Tess glanced over , pulled toward the sound of despair . Then her arm brushed Ben 's and she continued toward the alley . A small man with horn-rimmed glasses and a camerastepped out . He took out a blue bandanna and rubbed it over his nose . " It 's all yours . Get him , for Christ 's sake . I do n't want to photographany more dead blondes . A man 's got to have a little variety in his work . " " You 're a riot , Sly . " Ben brushed by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken only a few steps into the alley when the scent of death rose up . They all recognized it , that bitter , fetid stench which was both offensive and eerily compelling to the living . Her body had emptied itself . Her blood had settled . Her arms had been folded neatly across her body , but she did n't look at peace . Sightless , her eyes were locked open . There was a smear of dried blood on her chin . Her own , Tess thought . Sometime during the struggle to live , she had sawed her teeth through her bottom lip . She 'd worn a long , serviceable wool coat in olive drab . The white silk amice stood out starkly against it . It had been taken from around her neck , where bruises had already formed , and smoothed over her breasts . The note was pinned there , the message the same . Her sins are forgiven her . But this time the letters were n't printed neatly . They were wavery , and the paper was crumpled a bit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was printed larger than the rest , the markingsdarker , almost going through the paper . Tess crouched down beside the body for a closer look . A cry for help ? she wondered . Was it a plea for someone to stop him from sinning again ? The shaky handwriting was a deviation , however slight , from his routine . It meant , to Tess , that he was losing his hold , perhaps doubting himself even as he fulfilled his mission . He had n't been so sure this time , she decided . His mind was becoming a logjam of thoughts , memories , and voices . He must be terrified , she thought , and almost certainly physically ill by now . Her coat had been left open rather than neatly arranged . There was n't enough of a breeze in the alley to have flapped it open . So he had n't tidied it as he had the clothing of the others . Perhaps he had n't been able to . Then she saw the lapel pin against the green wool , a gold heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne . A wave of pity washed over her , for Anne , and for the man who had been driven to kill her . Ben saw the way she studied the body , clinically , dispassionately , without revulsion . He 'd wanted to shield her from the reality of death , but also wanted to press her face into it until she 'd wept and ran the other way . " If you 've gotten yourself a good look , Dr. Court , why do n't you back off and let us do our job ? " She looked up at Ben , then rose slowly to her feet . " He 's nearly finished . I do n't think he 's going to be able to take much more . " " Tell that to her . " " Kid puked all over the place , " Ed said lightly , and breathed through his mouth to try to combat the stench . With a pencil he flipped open the woman 's wallet , which had spilled out of her purse . " Anne Reasoner , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lives about a block up on M. " A block up , Tess thought . A block closer to her own apartment . She pressed her lips together and looked out of the alley until the fear passed . " It 's a ritual , " she said clearly enough . " From everything I 've read , ritual , rites , traditions , are an intricate part of the Catholicp107Church . He 's performing his own ritual here , saving them then absolvingthem and leaving them with this . " She indicated the amice . " The symbol of that salvation and absolution . He folds the amice exactly the same way each time . He positions their bodies exactly the same way . But this time he did n't tidy her clothes . " " Playing detective ? " Tess balled her hands in her pockets , fighting to overlook Ben 's sarcasm . " This is devotion , blind devotion to the Church , obsession with ritual . But the handwriting shows that he 's beginning to questionwhat he 's doing , what he 's driven to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger rushed into him at her lack of emotional response . Ben turned his back to her and bent over the body . " Why do n't you go out to the car and write that up ? We 'll be sure to pass on your professional opinion to her family . " He did n't see her face , the quick hurt then the slow anger that came into her eyes . But he heard her walk away . " Little rough on her , were n't you ? " Ben did n't look at his partner either , but at the woman who had been Anne . She stared back at him . Serve and protect . No one had protected Anne Reasoner . " She does n't belong here , " he murmured , and thought as much of Anne Reasoner as of Tess . He shook his head , still studying the almost saintlike pose of the body . " What was she doing in an alley in the middle of the night ? " An alley that was close , too damn close , to Tess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drawing his brows together , Ben lifted up one of her feet . She 'd worn loafers . The kind that last through college , your first marriage and divorce . The leather fit her feet like gloves and was well polished . The back of the heel was freshly scraped and scarred . " So he killed her on the street and dragged her in . " Ben looked over at Ed as his partner crouched and examined the other shoe . " He strangled her out on the flicking street . We got streetlights about every ten goddamn feet in this neighborhood . We got black and whites cruising every thirty minutes , and he kills her on the street . " He looked at her hands . Her nails were medium length and well shaped.  |p108Only  three of them were broken . The coral-colored polish was unchipped . " Does n't look like she put up much of a fight . " THE LIGHT WAS TURNING gray , a washed-out , milky gray thatpromised overcast skies and cold autumn rain . Dawn floated over the city without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hangovers were brewing . The first church services would begin soon with raw-eyed , weekend-dazed congregations . Tess leaned against the hood of Ben 's car . The suede jacket was n't warm enough in the chilled dawn , but she was too restless to get insidethe car . She watched a round man with a medical bag and bluepaisleypajama bottoms under a flapping overcoat go into the alley . The coroner 's day had started early . From somewhere blocks away came the grinding metallic sound of a truck changing gears . A single cab rode by without slowing down . One of the uniformed cops brought a big Styrofoam cup with steam and the scent of coffee rising off the top , and handed it to the figure in back of the cruiser . Tess looked toward the alley again . She 'd held up , she told herself , though her stomach was roiling now in reaction . She 'd been professional , as she 'd promised herself she would be . But she would n't forget Anne Reasoner for a long time . Death was n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would have kicked and pulled at the scarf with her hands and tried to scream . Tess took a long gulp of air that hurt her throat , raw from swallowingnausea . She was a doctor . She repeated it over and over until the cramp in her stomach eased . She 'd been trained to deal with death . And she had dealt with it . Turning away from the alley , she faced the empty street . Who was she trying to fool ? She dealt with despair , with phobias , neuroses , even violence , but she 'd never been face-to-face with the victimof a murder . Her life was ordered , protected because she 'd made certain of it . Pastel walls and questions and answers . Even her hoursp109at the clinic were tame compared to the day-to-day violence on the streets of the city where she lived . She knew about ugliness , violence , and perversion , but she 'd always been neatly separated from all of it by her own background . The senator 's granddaughter , the bright young student , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , and three published papers . She 'd treated the helpless , the hopeless , and the pitiful , but she 'd never knelt down beside murder . " Dr. Court ? " She turned back and saw Ed . Instinctively she looked past him and spotted Ben talking to the coroner . " I wrangled you some coffee . " " Thanks . " She took the cup and sipped slowly . " Want a bagel ? " " No . " She laid a hand on her stomach . " No . " " You did okay in there . " The coffee settled and seemed content to stay down . Looking over the cup , she met his eyes . He understood , she realized , and neithercondemned nor pitied . " I hope I never have to do it again . " A black plastic bag was carried out of the alley . Tess found herselfable to watch as it was loaded into the morgue van . " It never gets any easier , " Ed murmured . " I used to wish it would . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure if it gets easier , it means you 've lost the edge that makes you want to find out why . " She nodded . Common sense and common compassion in his quiet voice were soothing . " How long have you and Ben been partners ? " " Five , almost six years . " " You suit each other . " " Funny , I was just thinking the same thing about you . " She gave a low , humorless laugh . " There 's a difference between attraction and suitability . " " Maybe . There 's also a difference between stubbornness andp110stupidity . " His look remained bland as her head came around . " Anyway , Dr. Court , " he went on before she had a chance to react . " I was hoping you might talk to the witness for a couple of minutes . He 's pretty shook up , and we 're not getting anywhere . " " All right . " She nodded at the cruiser . " That 's him in the car , is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tess walked to the car and crouched at the open door . He was hardly more than a boy , she thought . Twenty , maybe twenty-two . While he shivered and gulped coffee , his face was pale , with a high flush of color over the cheekbones . His eyes were puffed and red from weeping , and his teeth clattered . He 'd put dents with his thumbs in the sides of the Styrofoam cup . He smelt of beer and vomit and terror . " Gil ? " After a jolt , he turned his head . She had n't any doubt he was stone sober now , but she could see a bit too much white around his irises . His pupils were dilated . " I 'm Dr. Court . How are you feeling ? " " I want to go home . I 've been sick . My stomach hurts . " There was a trace of the whining self-pity of a drunk who 'd had cold water dumped in his face . Under it was plain fear . " Finding her must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about it . " His mouth contracted into a thin white line . " I want to go home . " " I 'll call someone for you if you like . Your mother ? " Tears began to squeeze out of his eyes again . His hands trembleduntil the coffee sloshed in his cup . " Gil , why do n't you step out of the car ? You might feel better if you stood up in the fresh air . " " I want a cigarette . I smoked all of mine . " " We 'll get some . " She held out a hand . After a moment 's hesitation , he took it . His fingers closed over hers like a vice . " I do n't want to talk to the cops . " " Why ? " " I should have a lawyer . Should n't I have a lawyer ? " " I 'm sure you can if you like , but you 're not in trouble , Gil. "  | " I found her . " " Yes . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she took the halfemptycup before he could spill the remaining coffee over his pants . " Gil , we need you to tell us whatever you know so we can find out who killed her . " He looked around and saw the blue uniforms and impassive faces . " They 're going to dump it on me . " " No . " She spoke calmly , having anticipated him . Keeping close to his side , she began to lead him toward Ben . " They do n't think you killed her . " " I got a record . " He said it in a shaky whisper . " Drug bust last year . Just petty shit , a little grass , but the cops 'll figure I got a record , I found her , I killed her . " " It 's natural to be scared . That 's not going to go away until you talk about what happened . Try to be logical , Gil . Has anyone arrestedyou ? " No . " Has anyone asked you if you killed that woman ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He focused on the alley with blank , fascinatedhorror . " And she was ... " " That 's what you need to get out . Gil , this is Detective Paris . " She stopped in front of Ben but kept her hand on Gil 's arm . " He 's with Homicide , and too smart to think you killed anyone . " Beneath the words the message was clear . Go easy . Ben 's resentmentcommunicated itself just as lucidly . He did n't have to be told how to handle a witness . " Ben , Gil could use a cigarette . " " Sure . " Ben reached for his pack and shook one out . " Rough morning , " he commented as he struck a match . Gil 's hands still shook , but he drew greedily on the cigarette . " Yeah . " His eyes darted over and up as Ed approached . " This is Detective Jackson , " Tess continued in a soothing , introductoryvoice . " They need you to tell them what you saw . " " Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need you to sign a statement . " Ben shook out a cigarette of his own.  | " Man , I just want to go home . " " We 'll get you home . " Ben looked at Tess through the haze of his smoke . " Just take it easy and tell it from the beginning . " " I was at a party . " He stopped dead and looked at Tess . She gave him an encouraging nod . " You can check , it was over on Twentysixth . Some friends of mine just got the apartment , see , and it was like a moving-in party . I can give you names . " " That 's fine . " Ed had his notebook out . " We 'll get them from you later . When did you leave the party ? " " I do n't know . I had too much to drink and got into it with my girl . She does n't like it when I party too hard . We had words , you know . " He swallowed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shuddering breath . " She got pissed and left , that was about onethirty . Took the car , so I could n't drive . " " Sounds like she was looking out for you , " Ed put in . " Yeah , well , I was too wasted to see it that way . " The rumblingsof a heroic hangover were already beginning . Gil preferred it to the nausea . " What happened after she left ? " Ed prompted . " I hung around . I think I crashed for a while . The party was winding down when I woke up . Lee  --  it was his apartment , Lee Grimes  --  he says I can sleep on the couch , but I . . . well , I needed air , you know ? I was going to walk home . I guess I was already feelingpretty sick , so I stopped , just across the street there . " He turned and pointed . " My head was spinning , and I knew I was going to toss up some beer . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I see this guy come out of the alley  --  " " You saw him come out , " Ben interrupted . " You did n't hear anything ? See him go in ? " " No , I swear . I do n't know how long I 'd been standing there . Not too long , I think , ' cause it was cold as hell . Even drunk I was thinking I had to move to keep warm . I saw him come out , then he leaned up against the lamppost for a minute , like he was sick too . I thought it was kind of funny , two drunks weaving across the street from each other , like something out of a cartoon . And one of the drunks is a priest . "  | " How do you know that ? " Ben paused in the act of offering Gil another cigarette . " He 's wearing this priest 's suit  --  the black dress with the white collar . I was laughing to myself . You know , looks like he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there wondering if I 'm going to piss in my pants or barf , and he straightens himself up and walks away . " " Which way ? " " Toward M. Yeah , toward M Street . He went around the corner . " " Did you see what he looked like ? " " Man , I saw he was a priest . " Gil pounced on the fresh cigarette . " He was white . " He pressed his fingers to his eyes . " Yeah , he was a white dude . I think he had dark hair . Look , I was wasted , and he was standing with his face against the lamppost . " " Okay . You 're doing good . " Ed flipped a page in his notebook . " How about build ? Could you tell if he was short , tall ? " Gil screwed his face up in concentration . Though he still consumedthe cigarette in great gulps , Tess saw he was calming . " I guess he was pretty tall , not a little guy anyhow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average , you know . About like you , I guess , " he said to Ben . " How about age ? " Ben put in . " I do n't know . He was n't old and feeble . His hair was dark . " He said it quickly as it flashed into his memory . " Yeah , I 'm sure it was dark , not gray or blond . He had his hands in it like this . " He demonstrated , pressing his hands against the side of his head . " Like his head was hurting him pretty bad . His hands were black , but his face was white . Like he had gloves on , you know . It was cold . " He stopped again as the full implication hit him . He 'd seen a murderer . Fear doubled back , a personal thing . If he 'd seen , he was involved . The muscles in his face began to tremble . " He 's the one who 's been doing all these women . He 's the one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this up , " Ben said easily . " How 'd you find the body ? " " Oh , Christ . " He closed his eyes , and Tess moved toward him . " Gil , try to remember it 's over . What you 're feeling is going to fade . It 'll start to fade a little bit after you say it all out loud . Once you say it out loud , it 'll be easier . "  | " Okay . " He reached for her hand and held on . ' After the guy left I was feeling a little better , like maybe I was going to keep everything down after all . But I 'd had a lot of beer and I had to get rid of some , you know . I still had myself together enough to know I could n't just piss all over the sidewalk . So I walked over to the alley . I almost tripped over her . " He ran the back of his hand under his nose as it started to leak . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her . Jesus . There was enough light coming in from the street so that I saw her face , real good . I never saw anyone dead before . Not ever . It 's not like the movies , man . It ai n't nothing like the movies . " He took a minute , sucking on the cigarette and crushing Tess 's fingers . " I gagged . I took a couple of steps trying to get out , and I just started throwing up . I thought my sides would bust before I stopped . My head was going around again , but I got out somehow . I think I fell down on the sidewalk . There were cops . A couple of them stopped their car . I told them . . . I just told them to go in the alley . " " You did good , Gil . " Ben took his pack of cigarettes and stuffed it the boy 's pocket . " We 're going to have one of the officers take you home , let you get cleaned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station . " " Can I call my girl ? " " Sure . " " If she had n't taken the car , she 'd have been walking home . She might 've walked past here . " " Call your girl , " Ben told him . " And ease off the beer . Whittaker . " Ben signaled to the driver of the first cruiser . " Take Gil home , will you ? And give him some time to clean up and pull it together before you bring him in . " " He could use some sleep , Ben , " Tess murmured . He started to snap at her , then cut himself off . The kid looked ready to drop . " Right . Drop him off , Whittaker . We 'll send a car for you about noon . Okay ? " " Yeah . " He looked at Tess then . " Thanks . I do feel better . " " If what happens gives you some trouble and you want to talk about it , call the station . They 'll give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , Ben had Tess by the arm , leading her away . " The department does n't approve of soliciting for patients at the scene . " Tess shook off his arm . " Yes , you 're welcome , Detective . I 'm glad I could help you get a coherent story out of your only witness . " " We 'd have gotten it out of him . " Ben cupped his hands around a match and lit a fresh cigarette . Out of the corner of his eye he saw Harris arrive on the scene . " You really hate it that I helped , do n't you ? Because I 'm a psychiatrist , I wonder , or because I 'm a woman ? " " Do n't psychoanalyze me , " he warned , tossed his cigarette into the street , and immediately wished it back . " I do n't have to psychoanalyze to see resentment , prejudice , and anger . " She broke off , realizing how close she was to losing controlin public and creating a scene . " Ben , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I did n't get in the way . " " Get in the way ? " He laughed and studied her face . " No , you 're a real pro , lady . " " That 's it , is n't it ? " she murmured . She wanted to shout , to sit down , to just walk away . It took the rest of her control not to do any of those things . Whatever you begin , you finish . That , too , was part of her training . " I walked into that alley with you and stayed on the same level . I did n't fall apart , get sick , run away . I did n't get hysterical at the sight of a body , and that really bothers you . " " Doctors are objective , right ? " " That 's right , " she said calmly , though Anne Reasoner 's face flashed into her mind . " But maybe it 'll soothe your ego to know that it was n't easy for me . I wanted to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him jerked , but he ignored it . " You held up pretty good . " " And that strips me of my femininity , maybe even my sexuality . You would have been happier if you 'd had to carry me out of that alley . Never mind the interference or inconvenience . That would have been more comfortable for you . " " That 's bullshit . " He pulled out another cigarette , cursing himself because he realized it was true . " I work with plenty of women cops . "  | " But you do n't sleep with them , do you , Ben ? " She said it quietly , knowing she 'd hit a button . Eyes narrowed , he drew in smoke , long and deep . " Watch your step . " " Yes , that 's just what I intend to do . " She pulled her gloves out of her pockets , realizing for the first time that her hands were freezing . The sun was up now , but the light was still murky . She did n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain that he 'll have an updated report by tomorrow afternoon . " " Fine . I 'll get someone to drive you home . " " I want to walk . " " No . " He took her arm before she could turn away . " You 've mentioned that I 'm a civilian enough times to know you ca n't order me . " " Press charges of harassment if you want , but you 're getting an escort home . " " It 's two blocks , " she began , and his grip tightened . " That 's right . Two blocks . Two blocks , and your name and picturehave been in the paper . " With his free hand he gathered up her hair . It was nearly the same shade as Anne Reasoner 's . They both knew it . " Use some of those brains you 're so proud of , and think . " " I 'm not going to let you frighten me . " " Fine , but you 're getting an escort home . " He kept his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruiser.  |p117THE  FIVE DETECTIVES ASSIGNED to the Priest homicideslogged better than two hundred sixty hours in legwork and paperwork in the week following Anne Reasoner 's murder . One of them had a spouse who threatened divorce , another worked through a nasty bout of the flu , and another around a chronic case of insomnia . The fourth in the series of murders was the top story on both the six and eleven o'clock news , beating out such items as the President 's return from West Germany . For the moment Washington was more interested in murder than politics . NBC planned a four-part special . Incredibly , manuscripts were being peddled to major publishers . More incredibly , offers were being made . Paramount was thinkingminiseries . Anne Reasoner  --  in fact , none of the victims  --  had ever earned such attention alive . Anne had lived alone . She had been a CPA attached to one of the city 's law firms . Her apartment had shown a taste for the avant garde , with neon , free-formed enameled sculptures and DayGlo flamingos . Her wardrobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and silk blouses . She 'd been able to afford Saks . She 'd owned two Jane Fonda workout tapes , an IBM personal computer ,  |p118and  a Cuisinart . There was a man 's picture in a frame beside her bed , a quarter ounce of Colombian in her bureau drawer , and fresh flowers  --  white zinnias  --  on top of it . She 'd been a good employee . Only three days out sick since the first of the year . But her coworkers knew nothing about her social life . Her neighbors described her as friendly and described the man in the bedside picture as a frequent guest . ' Her address book had been neatly ordered and nearly full . Many of the names were passing acquaintances and distant family , along with insurance brokers , an oral surgeon , and an aerobics instructor . Then they located Suzanne Hudson , a graphic artist who had been Anne 's friend and confidante since college . Ben and Ed found her at home , in an apartment above a boutique . She was wearing a terry-cloth robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red and swollen , with bruising shadows down to the cheekbones . The sound on the television was off , but the Wheel of Fortune played on screen . Someone had just solved the puzzle : WHEN IT RAINSI I ' POURS . After she let them in , she went to the couch and curled up her feet . " There 's coffee in the kitchen if you want it . I 'm having a hard time making the effort to be sociable . " " Thanks , anyway . " Ben took the opposite end of the couch and left the chair for Ed . " You knew Anne Reasoner pretty well . " " Did you ever have a best friend ? I do n't mean someone you just called the best , but someone who was ? " Her short red hair had n't been tended to . She combed a hand through it and sent it into spikes . " I really loved her , you know ? I still ca n't quite grip the fact that she 's . " She bit down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee . " The funeral 's tomorrow . " " I know . Ms. Hudson , it 's a hell of a time to bother you , but we need to ask you some questions . " " John Carroll . " " I 'm sorry , what ? " " John Carroll . " Suzanne repeated the name , then spelled it meticulouslywhen Ed produced his notebook . " You wanted to knowp119why Anne would have been out walking alone in the middle of the night , did n't you ? " The grief and anger were there as she leaned forward and picked up an address book . With the coffee still in her hand , she used her thumb to page through it . " Here 's his address . " She passed the book to Ed . " We have a John Carroll , a lawyer who was on staff at the firm Ms. Reasoner worked for . " Ed flipped back in his notes and coordinatedthe addresses . " That 's right . That 's him . " " He has n't come into the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she snapped . " He would n't have the courage to come out and face what he 's done . If he comes tomorrow , if he dares to show his face tomorrow , I 'll spit in it . " Then she covered her eyes with her hand and shook her head . " No , no , it 's not right . " Fatigue came through now as she lowered her hand again . " She loved him . She really loved him . They 've been seeing each other for almost two years , ever since he joined the firm . Kept it quiet  --  his idea . " She took a big gulp of coffee and managed to keep her emotions in check . " He did n't want office gossip . She went along with it . She went along with everything . You ca n't imagine how much she swallowedfor that man . Anne was the original Miss Independence  --  I 've made it on my own and like it , single is an alternative life-style . She was n't militant , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own space . Until John . " " They had a relationship , " Ben prompted . " If you can call it that . She did n't even tell her parents abouthim . No one knew but me . " She rubbed her eyes . Mascara had beenclumped on her lashes and came off in flakes . " She was so happy at first . I guess I was happy for her , but I did n't like the fact that shewas . . . well , so controlled by him . Little things , you know . If heliked Italian food , she did . If he was into French movies , so was she . " Suzanne struggled against the bitterness and grief for a moment . Her free hand began to clamp and unclamp over the lapel of herrobe . " She wanted to get married . She needed to marry him . All shep120could think of was bringing their relationship out and registering at Bloomingdale 's . He kept putting her off , not saying no , just not yet . Not yet . Anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands on him , and he dumped her . Just like that . He did n't even have the guts to say it to her face . He called her . " " When did this happen ? " Suzanne did n't answer Ben for several seconds . She stared blankly at the television screen . A woman spun the wheel and hit Bankrupt . Tough break . " The night she was killed . She called me that same night , saying she did n't know what she was going to do , how she was going to handleit . It hit her hard . He was n't just another guy , he was it for Anne . I asked her if she wanted me to come over , but she said she wanted to be alone . I should have gone . " She screwed her eyes closed . " I should have gotten in my car and gone over . We could 've gotten drunk or high or ordered pizza . Instead she went out walking alone . " Ben said nothing as she wept quietly . Tess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere and infuriated him . " Ms. Hudson . " Ben gave her a moment , then continued . " Do you know if anyone her uneasy ? " " She did n't notice anyone but John . She 'd have told me . " She let out a long breath and rubbed the back of her hand under her eyes . " We 'd even talked about this maniac a couple of times , talked about being extra careful until he was caught . She went out because she was n't thinking . Or maybe because she had too much to think about . She 'd have pulled herself out  --  Anne was tough . She just never had the chance . " They left her on the couch staring at the Wheel and went to see John Carroll. he had a duplex in a part of town that catered to young profesWon.ls . There was a gourmet market around the corner , a liquorwort that would carry obscure brands , and a shop specializing in athwear , all tucked within reasonable walking distance of the resiarea . A dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered the door after the third knock . He was wearing anp121undershirt and jogging pants and carrying a fifth of Chevas Regal . There was little resemblance to the young , successful lawyer on his way up . Three days ' worth of beard shadowed his chin . His eyes were swollen and the skin had folded into pockets that drooped beneath . He smelled like a vagrant who had crawled into an alley on Fourteenth to sleep it off . He took a cursory look at the badges , hefted the bottle for another swig , and turned away , leaving the door open . Ed closed it . The duplex had wide-planked oak floors partially covered with a couple of Aubussons . In the living area the sofa was long and low ; the upholstery on it and the chairs ran to masculine colors , grays and blues . State-of-the-art electronic equipment was displayed on one wall . Along another was a collection of toys  --  antique slots , banks , trains . Carroll collapsed on the sofa in the center of the room . Two empty bottles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed over the cushions . Ben calculated he had n't moved much beyond that spot since he 'd been notified . " I can come up with a couple of clean glasses . " His voice was husky but not slurred , as though the liquor had quit doing its job some time before . " But you ca n't drink , can you ? On duty . " He lifted the bottle again and sucked . " I 'm not on duty . " " We 'd like to ask you some questions about Anne Reasoner , Mr. Carroll . " There was a chair behind him , but Ben did n't sit . " Yeah , I figured you 'd get around to it . I told myself if I did n't pass out , I 'd talk to you . " He looked at the bottle that was barely three-quarters full . " Ca n't seem to pass out . " Ed took the bottle from his fingers and set it aside . " Does n't help , really , does it ? " " Something 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his eyes , then began to search the littered smoked-glass coffee table for a cigarette . Ben lit one for him . " Thanks . " He drew hard and kept most of the smoke in his lungs . " I quit two years ago , " he said , and drew again . " Did n't gain any weight , though , because I cut out starch . " " You and Miss Reasoner had a relationship , " Ben began . " You were one of the last people to talk to her . "  | " Yes . Saturday night . We were supposed to go to the National . Sunday in the Park with George . Anne 's fond of musicals . I prefer straight drama myself , but  --  " " You did n't go to the theater ? " Ben interrupted . " I was feeling pressured . I called her to break the date and told her 1 wanted to let the relationship cool for a while . That 's how I c.tid it . " He looked up , over the cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool for a while . It sounded reasonable . " " Did you have fight ? " " A fight ? " He laughed at that and choked on smoke . " No , we did n't fight . We never fought . I do n't believe in it . There 's always a logical and reasonable solution to any problem . This was a reasonablesolution , and it was for her own good . " " Did you see her that night , Mr. Carroll ? " " No . " He looked around absently for the bottle , but Ed hadit it out of reach . " She asked me to come over , to talk it out . She was crying . I did n't want to have one of those tearful scenes , so I said no . I told her I thought it best if we gave it a little time . In a week or two we could have drinks after work and talk about it calmly . In a week or two . " He stared straight ahead . The ash from his cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " She phoned you again ? " Ed balanced his notepad on his palm . " What time was that ? " " It was 3:35 . My clock radio 's right beside the bed . I was annoyed with her . I should n't have been , but I was . She was high . I can always tell when she 's had a joint . She did n't have an outrageous habit , just burned a joint now and then to ease tension , but I did n't like it . It 's so childish , you know , " he added . " I figured she 'd done it to irritate me . She told me she 'd come to some decisions . She wanted me to know that she did n't blame me . She was going to take responsibility for her own emotions , and not to worry about her causing any scenes at the office . " When he sat back and closed his eyes , his dark blond hair fell over his forehead . " I was relieved at that , because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of thinking to do , a lot of reevaluat/ing before we talked again . I said that was fine and I 'd see her Monday . When I hung up it was 3:42 . That 's seven minutes . " Gil Norton had seen the murderer come out of the alley sometimebetween four and four-thirty . Ed noted the times on his pad , then put it in his pocket . " You 're probably not in the mood for advice , Mr. Carroll , but you 'd be better off if you went up to bed and got some sleep . " He focused on Ed , then looked at the litter of bottles at his feet . " I loved her . How come I did n't know it until now ? " BEN STEPPED OUTSIDE AND hunched his shoulders against the cold . " Christ . " " I do n't think Suzanne Hudson would feel like spitting in his face now . " " So what have we got ? " Ben walked to the car and took the driver 's seat . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A woman trying to pull back from a bad affair , who goes for a walk . And a psychopath who just happens to be there when she does . " " A psychopath who wears a cassock . " Ben stuck the key in the ignition but did n't turn it . " You think he 's a priest ? " Instead of answering , Ed sat back and stared at the sky through the windshield . " How many sort of tall , dark-haired priests you figurethere are in the city ? " Ed took out a plastic bag of trail mix . " Enough to keep us busy for six months . We have n't got six months . " " It would n't hurt to talk to Logan again . " " Yeah . " He dipped his fingers into the plastic bag Ed offered without thinking . " How about this ? A former priest , one who dropped out because of some Church-oriented tragedy . Logan might be able to get us a few names . " " Another crumb . In her report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last murder probably left him disabled for a couple of days . "  | " I read it . What the hell is this ? Bark and twigs ? " Ben twisted the key and pulled out from the curb . " Raisins , almonds , some granola . You ought to call her , Ben . " " I 'll handle my personal life , partner . " He turned the corner and went a block before he swore . " Sorry . " " No problem . You know , I saw this special . It pointed out that in current society , men really have it made . Women have taken the pressure off them to be the sole support  --  the Mr. Macho who has to handle all the problems and bring home the bacon . Women are generally waiting longer to look for marriage if they look for marriageat all , which leaves men with more choices . Today 's woman is n't looking for Prince Charming on a white charger . The funny thing is , a lot of men are still threatened by strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pretty amazing . " " Kiss ass . " " Dr. Court strikes me as being pretty independent . " " Good for her . Who wants a woman who hangs all over you ? " " Bunny did n't hang exactly , " Ed remembered . " She sort of draped . " " Bunny was comic relief , " Ben muttered . And Bunny had been one of his standard three-month affairs where you meet , share a few dinners , have a few laughs , bounce around in the sheets , and call it quits before anyone gets any ideas . He thought of Tess leaning back against his windowsill and laughing . " Look , when you 're in our business you need a woman who does n't make you think all the time . Who does n't make you think about her all the time . " " You 're making a mistake . " Ed leaned back . " But I figure you 're smart enough to see it for yourself . " Ben made the turn toward Catholic University . " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.M. ALL the detectives assigned to the Priest homicidesbut Bigsby were spread out in the conference room . Harris had a copy of all the reports in front of him , but went over eachp125point by point . They traced Anne Reasoner 's movements on the finalnight of her life . At 5:05 P.M. she had left her regular beauty salon , where she 'd had a trim , color touch-up , blow-dry , and manicure . She 'd been in excellent spirits and had tipped her operator ten dollars . At fivefifteenshe had picked up her dry cleaning . One gray suit , with vest , two linen blouses , and a pair of gabardine slacks . At approximately five-thirty she had arrived home . Her next-door neighbor had spokento her in the hall . Anne had mentioned going to the theater that evening . She 'd carried fresh flowers . At seven-fifteen John Carroll had called her and broken their date and their relationship . They had spoken for roughly fifteen minutes . At eight-thirty Anne Reasoner had called Suzanne Hudson . She 'd been upset , tearful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next-door neighbor had heard Reasoner 's television . She 'd noticed it because she was coming in for the eveningherself and had n't expected Reasoner to be home . At 3:35 Reasoner had phoned Carroll . Two roaches of marijaunahad been found beside the phone . They had talked until 3:42 . None of the neighbors heard Reasoner leave the building . Sometime between four and four-thirty A.M. Gil Norton had seen a man dressed as a priest exit the alley two blocks from Reasoner'sapartment . At 4:36 Norton attracted the attention of two patrolmen and reported the body . " Those are the facts , " Harris said . Behind him was a map of the city with the murder sights flagged with blue pins . " From the map we can see that he 's confined himself to an area less than seven square miles . All the murders have occurred between one and five A.M. There is no sexual assault , no robbery . From the pattern Monsignor Logan established , we expect him to hit again on December eighth . Street patrols will be working double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is a man of average or above average height , that he has dark hair and dresses as a priest . From Dr. Court 's psychiatricprofile and reports , we know that he is psychopathic , possiblyschizophrenic , with religious delusions . He kills only young , blondp126women , who apparently symbolize an actual person who is or was in his life . " Dr. Court feels that due to the break in pattern of the murder , and the disorder of the printing on the note left on the body , that he is nearing a crisis in his psychosis . The last murder may have cost him more than he can afford . " He dropped the file on the table , thinking it was more than any of them could afford . " It 's her opinion that he would have had a physical reaction , headaches , nausea , that would have debilitated him . If he is still able to function on a normal level for periods of time , it 's placing an enormous strain on him . She believes it would show in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused a moment , to make certain everyone in the room was taking it in . The room was separated from the squad room by windowsand venetian blinds that were yellowing with age . Beyond them could be heard the steady hum of activity , phones , footsteps , voices . There was a coffee machine in the corner and a jumbo-sized plastic cup for cops with a conscience to drop in twenty-five cents a shot . Harris walked over to it , poured a cup , and added a spoonful of the powdered cream he detested . He drank and looked at his staff . They were restless , overworked , and frustrated . If they did n't start cutting down to an eight-hour day , he was going to lose some of them to the flu . Lowenstein and Roderick were already poppingdecongestants . He could n't afford to have them off sick , and he could n't afford to pamper them . " We have in this room over sixty years of police experience . It 's time we put those sixty-odd years on the line and catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast down in the morning anymore . " " Ed and I talked to Logan again . " Ben pushed aside his plastic cup of coffee . " Since the guy dresses like a priest , we thought we 'd start treating him like one . As a psychiatrist , Logan talks to and treats fellow priests who are having any kind of emotional problems . He 's not going to give us a list of his patients , but he 's going through his files , checking for anything  --  anyone who might fit . Then there 's a matter of the confessional . " He stopped for a moment . Confession was part of the Catholicp127ritual that had always given him a problem . He could remember well kneeling in that dark little room with the screened panel , confessing , repenting , atoning . Go and sin no more . But , of course , he had . " A priest has to confess to somebody , and it has to be another priest . If Dr. Court 's right , and he 's beginning to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have to confess . " " So we start interviewing priests , " Lowenstein put in . " Look , obviously I do n't know a lot about Catholics , but is n't there something about the sanctity of the confessional ? " " We probably would n't get a priest to finger anyone who came to him in the confessional , " Ben agreed . " But maybe we 'd get anotherlocation . Chances are he 'd stick with his own parish . Tess  --  Dr. Court  --  said he probably attended church regularly . We might be able to find out what church . If he 's a priest , or was one , he 'd probably be drawn to his own church . " He rose and went to the map . " This area , " he said , circling the blue flags , " includes two parishes . I 'm betting he 's been to one or both of these churches , maybe standing on the altar . " " You figure he 's going to show up on Sunday , " Roderick put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his nose to relievesome pressure . " Especially if Dr. Court was right and he was too sick to make it last week . He 'll need the support of the ceremony . " " I think so . Masses run Saturday evening too . " " I thought that was our province , " Lowenstein commented . " Catholics are flexible . " Ben dipped his hands in his pockets . " And they like to sleep late on Sunday like everybody else . The thing is , I 'm betting this guy is a traditionalist . Sunday morning is for mass , the mass should still be said in Latin , and you do n't eat meat on Friday . Church rules . I think Court 's got something when she says the guy 's obsessed with Church rules . " " So we cover the two churches on Sunday . In the meantime , we 've got a couple of days to interview priests . " Harris looked at each of his detectives . " Lowenstein , you and Roderick take one parish , Jackson and Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bigsby ? " " He said he had a lead on the amices , Captain . " Roderick rose and poured a cup of ice water , knowing there was too much coffeep128in his system already . " Look , I do n't want to throw a wrench in the works , but suppose he does show up during one of the masses on Sunday . What makes any of us think we can pick him out of the congregation ? The guy is n't a freak , he is n't going to come in speaking in tongues or frothing at the mouth . Dr. Court points out that he 's just like anyone else except for the fact that he 's troubled . " " It 's all we 've got , " Ben stated , annoyed at having his own doubts stated by someone else . " We 've got to go with whatever advantage we have ; at the moment it 's location . We check out the men who come alone . Court also thinks he 's a loner , so he 's not going to come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step further and sees him as devout . A lot of people come to mass and nod off or at least space out . He would n't do either . " " Spending the day in church gives us the opportunity to try something else . " Ed finished a note then looked up . " Pray . " " It could n't hurt , " Lowenstein said under her breath as Bigsby swung into the room . " I 've got something . " He held a yellow pad in his hand , and his red and watery eyes were bulging . He 'd been spending his nights with Nyquil and a hot-water bottle . " One dozen white silk amices , invoice number 52346-A , ordered on June fifteenth from O'Donnely 's ReligiousSuppliers , Boston , Massachusetts . Delivery July thirty-first , ReverendFrancis Moore . The address is a post office in Georgetown . " " How 'd he pay for it ? " Harris 's voice was calm as he worked through the next steps . " Money order . " " Track it down . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its way . " " Lowenstein , get to the post office . " He checked his watch and nearly swore in frustration . " Be there when it opens in the morning . Find out if he still has the box . Get a description . " " Yes , sir . " " I want to know if there 's a priest in the city whose name is Francis Moore . " " There 'd be a list of all the priests in the Archdiocese . We should be able to get it from their main office . "  |p129Harris  nodded at Ben . " Check it out . Then check out the rest of the Francis Moores . " He could n't argue with basic police work , but Ben 's instincts told him to concentrate on the area of the murders . He was there . Ben was sure of it . And now maybe they had his name . Back in the squad room the detectives hit the phones . An hour later Ben hung up and looked at Ed over the rubble on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore in the Archdiocese . Been here two-and-a-half years . He 's thirty-seven . " " And ? " " He 's black . " Ben reached for his cigarettes and found the pack empty . " We check him out anyway . What have you got ? " " I 've got seven . " Ed looked down at his neatly detailed list . Someone sneezed behind him and he winced . The flu was goingthrough the station like brushfire . " A high school teacher , a lawyer , a clerk at Sears , a currently unemployed , a bartender , a flight attendant , and a maintenance worker . He 's an ex-con . Attempted rape . " Ben checked his watch . He 'd been on duty just over ten hours . " Let 's go . " THE RECTORY MADE HIM uncomfortable . The scent of freshflowers competed with the scent of polished wood . They waited in a parlor with an old , comfortable sofa , two wing chairs , and a statue of a blue-robed Jesus with one hand raised in benediction . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Makes me feel like I should 've polished my shoes , " Ed murmured . Both men were conscious of the guns under their jackets , and did n't sit . From somewhere down the hall a door opened long enough to let out a few strains of Strauss . The door closed again and the waltz was replaced by footsteps . The detectives looked over as ReverendFrancis Moore walked in . He was tall and built like a fullback . His skin was the color of glossy mahogany and his hair was clipped close around a roundp130face . Against the black of his priest 's robe was a white sling . His right arm was in a plaster cast riddled with signatures . " Good evening . " He smiled , apparently more curious than pleased to have visitors . " I apologize for not shaking hands . " " Looks like you 've had some trouble . " Ed could almost feel his partner 's disappointment . Even if Gil Norton had been off on the description , there was no getting around that cast . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known better . Wo n't you sit down ? " " We need to ask you a few questions , Father . " Ben drew out his badge . " About the strangulation of four women . " " The serial killings . " Moore bowed his head a moment , as if in prayer . " What can I do ? " " Did you place an order with O'Donnely 's Religious Supplies in Boston last summer ? " " Boston ? " Moore 's free hand toyed with the rosary at his belt . " No . Father Jessup is in charge of supplies . He orders what we need from a firm here in Washington . " " I ) o you keep a post office box , Father ? " " Why , no . All our mail is delivered to the rectory . Excuse me , Detective ... " " Paris . " " Detective Paris . What is this all about ? " Ben hesitated a moment , then decided to push whatever buttonswere available . " Your name was used to order the murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tighten . Moore 's mouth openedthen closed . He reached out and gripped the left wing of a chair . " I  --  you suspect me ? " " There 's a possibility you know or have been in contact with the murderer . " " I ca n't believe it . " " Why do n't you sit down , Father ? " Ed touched him gently on the shoulder and eased him into the chair . " My name , " Moore murmured . " It 's hard to take it in . " Then he laughed shakily . " The name was given to me in a Catholic or/phanage in Virginia . It 's not even the one I was born with . I ca n't tell you that one because I do n't know it . " " Father Moore , you 're not a suspect , " Ben told him . " We have a witness who says the murderer is white , and you 've got your arm in a cast . " Moore wriggled his dark fingers , which disappeared into plaster . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew a breath and tried to pull himself together . " I 'll be honest with you , these murders have more than once been a topic of conversation here . The press calls him a priest . " " The police have yet to determine that , " Ed put in . " In any case , we 've all searched our souls and strained our minds trying to find some answers . I wish we had some . " " Are you close to your parishioners , Father ? " Moore turned to Ben again . " I wish I could say yes . There are some , of course . We have a church supper once a month , then there 's the youth group . Right now we 're planning a Thanksgiving dance for the Teen Club . I 'm afraid we do n't pack them in . " " Is there anyone who concerns you , someone you might consideremotionally unstable ? " " Detective , I 'm in the business of comforting the troubled . We 've had some drug and alcohol abuse , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , there 's no one I would even considercapable of these murders . " " Your name might have been pulled out of a hat , or it might have been used because the killer identified with you , as a priest . " Ben paused , knowing he was stepping onto the hard-packed unmovableground of the sanctified . " Father , has anyone come to you in the confessional and indicated in any way that he knew something about the murders ? " " Again I can be honest and say no . Detective , are you certain it was my name ? " Ed took out his notepad and read from it . " Reverend Francis Moore . " " Not Francis X. Moore ? "  | " No . " Moore passed his hand over his eyes . " I hope relief is n't a sin . When I was given my name and was old enough to learn to write it , I always used the X for Xavier . I thought having a middle name that began with X was exotic and unique . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of identification I have uses my middle initial . Everything I sign includes it . Everyone who knows me , knows me as Reverend Francis X. Moore . " Ed noted it down . If he 'd gone with instinct , he would have said good night and gone on to the next address on the list . Procedurewas more demanding and infinitely more boring than instinct . They interviewed the three other priests in the rectory . " Well , it only took us an hour to come up with nothing , " Ben commented as they walked back to the car . " We gave those guys something to talk about tonight . " " We put in yet another hour of overtime this week . Accounting'sgoing to hit the roof . " " Yeah . " Ed smiled a little as he eased into the passenger 's seat . " Lousy bastards . " " We could give them a break , or we can go see the ex-con . " Ed considered a moment , then pulled out the rest of his trail mix . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've got another hour . " /HERE WERE NO FRESH flowers in the one-room apartment in South East . The furniture , what there was of it , had n't been polishedsince it had been bought from the Salvation Army . A Murphy bed no one had bothered to tuck back into the wall took up most of the room . The sheets were n't clean . The unpleasant odors of sweat , stale sex , and onions hung in the room . The blonde had an inch of brown root showing in her frizzed mop of hair . She opened the door with the slow , wary stare of the knowing when Ben and Ed showed their badges . She wore snug jeans over a well-shaped rear , and a pink sweater that was cut low enough to show breasts that were starting to sag . Ben gauged her to be about twenty-five , though there were linesp133already dug deep at the sides of her mouth . Her eyes were brown , and the left one was set off by a bruise that had rainbowed into mauve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hit three or four days earlier . " Mrs. Moore ? " " No , we ai n't married . " The blonde dug a cigarette out of a pack of Virginia Slims . You 've come a long way , baby . " Frank went out for beer . He 'll be back in a minute . Is he in trouble ? " " We just need to talk to him . " Ed gave her an easy smile , and decided she needed more protein in her diet . " Sure . Well , I can tell you he 's been keeping out of trouble . I 've seen to that . " She found a pack of matches , lit her cigarette , then used the pack to squash a small roach . " Maybe he drinks a little too much , but I make sure he does it here , where he ca n't get in trouble . " She looked around the pitiful room and drew deep on the cigarette . " It do n't look like much , but I 'm putting money aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's dependable . You can ask his super . " " We 're not here to hassle Frank . " Ben decided against sitting . You could n't be sure what might be crawling under the cushions . " Sounds like you 've got him pretty much in line . " She touched her bruised eye . " I give as good as I get . " " I bet . What happened ? " " Frank wanted another five for beer on Saturday . I 've got a budget . " " Saturday ? " Ben came to attention . The night of the last murder . The woman facing him was a blonde , of sorts . " I guess you two got into it , then he stomped out so he could go down to the bar and bitch with the boys . " " He did n't go anywhere . " She grinned and tapped her ash into a plastic dish that invited you to PUT YOUR BUTT HERE . " He got a shot in , and the neighbors downstairs were beating with that damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She let the smoke trail lightly out of her mouth and up her nose . " Frank respects that sort of thing in a woman . He likes it , you know . So we . . . made up . He did n't think about beer anymore Saturday night . " The door opened . Frank Moore had arms like cinder blocks ,  |p134legs  like tree trunks , and stood maybe five feet five . He was wearing a black trench coat that had moth holes in the shoulder , and was carrying a six-pack of the King of Beers . " Who the hell are you ? " he demanded . His free arm was already flexed . Ben pulled out his badge . " Homicide . " Frank dropped his arm . Ben noticed the inch-long scratch on his cheek as he leaned over to read the badge . It was scabbed over and looked every bit as nasty as the blonde 's bruise . " The system eats shit , " Frank announced , and slammed the six-pack onto the counter . " That slut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up doing three years , then when I get out I got cops hanging around . I told you the system eats shit , Maureen . " " Yeah . " The blonde helped herself to a beer . " You told me . " " Why do n't you just tell us where you were last Sunday morning , Frank , " Ben began . " About four A.M. " " Four in the morning . Jesus , I was in bed like everybody else . And I was n't alone neither . " He jerked a thumb at Maureen before he popped the top on a Bud . Beer fizzled through the opening and added one more smell to the room . " You Catholic , Frank ? " Frank wiped the back of his hand over his mouth , belched , and drank again . " Do I look Catholic ? " " Frank 's daddy was Baptist , " Maureen supplied . " Shut your face , " Frank told her . " Kiss ass . " She only smiled when he lifted an arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it again . " You want to tell the cops everything , fine . My old man was Baptist . No cards , no drinking , no-fucking-around Baptist . He kicked my ass plenty , and I kicked his once before I left home . That was fifteen years ago . A two-bit whore railroaded me into prison . I did three years , and if I ever saw her again , I 'd kick her ass too . " He pulled a pack of Camels out of his shirt pocket and lit it with a batteredZippo . " I got a job washing floors and cleaning toilets . I come home every night so this bitch can tell me I only got five dollars forp135beer . I ai n't done nothing illegal . Maureen 'll tell you . " He swung a loving arm around the woman he 'd just called a bitch . " That 's right . " She took a swig from her beer . He did n't fit the description , not the physical one , nor the psychiatricone . Still Ben persisted . " Where were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I supposed to remember ? " Frank chugged the rest of the beer down and crushed the can . " You guys got a warrant to be in here ? " " We were in Atlantic City . " Maureen did n't blink when Frank tossed the can and missed the trash bag by inches . " Remember , Frank ? My sister works up there , you know . She got us a good deal at the hotel where she does housekeeping . The Ocean View Inn . It ai n't on the strip or nothing , but it 's close . We drove up on August fourteenth and spent three days . It 's in my diary " " Yeah , I remember . " He dropped his arm and turned on her . " I was playing craps and you came down and started bitching at me . " " You 'd lost twenty-five bucks . " " I 'd 've won it back , and twice that much , if you 'd left me be . " " You stole the money out of my purse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ben jerked his head toward the door as the argument heated up . " Let 's get out of here . " As the door closed behind him they heard a crash over the screaming . " Think we should break it up ? " Ben looked back at the door . " What , and spoil their fun ? " Something solid and breakable hit the door and shattered . " Let 's go get a drink . "  |p136MR  . MONROE , I APPRECIATE you coming by to talk withme . " Tess greeted Joey Higgins 's stepfather at the door to her office . " My secretary 's gone for the day , but I can fix us some coffee if you like . " " Not for me . " He stood , uncomfortable as always in her presence , and waited for her to make the first move . " I realize you 've already put in a full day , " she began , not addingshe 'd put in one of her own . " I do n't mind the extra time if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She smiled , gesturing him to a chair . " I have n't had many opportunities to speak to you privately , Mr. Monroe , but I want to tell you that I can see how hard you 're trying with Joey . " " It is n't easy . " He folded his overcoat on his lap . He was a tidy man , organized by nature . His fingers were neatly manicured , his hair combed into place , his suit dark and conservative . Tess thought she understood how inscrutable he would find a boy like Joey . " It 's harder on Lois , of course . " " Is it ? " Tess sat behind her desk , knowing the distance and the impersonal position would make it easier for him . " Mr. Monroe ,  |p137coming  into a family after a divorce and trying to be a father figure to a teenage boy is difficult under any circumstances . When the boy is as troubled as Joey , the difficulties are vastly multiplied . " " I 'd hoped by now , well . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat again . " I 'd hoped we could do things together , ball games . I even bought a tent , though I have to admit I do n't know the first thing about camping . But he 's not interested . " " Does n't feel he can allow himself to be interested , " Tess corrected . " Mr. Monroe , Joey has linked himself with his father to a very unhealthy degree . His father 's failures are his failures , his father'sproblems his problems . " " The bastard does n't even  --  " He cut himself off . " I 'm sorry . " " No , do n't apologize . I know it appears that Joey 's father does n't care , or ca n't be bothered . It stems from his illness , but that is n't what I wanted to speak with you about . Mr. Monroe , you know I 've tried to discuss intensifying Joey 's treatment . The clinic I mentioned in Alexandria specializes in emotional illness in adolescents . " " Lois wo n't hear of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " She feels , and I have to agree , that Joey would think we 'd abandoned him . " " The transition would be difficult , there 's no denying that . It would have to be handled by all of us in such a way that Joey understandshe is n't being punished or sent away , but offered another chance . Mr. Monroe , I have to be candid with you . Joey is not responding to treatment . " " He 's not drinking ? " " No , he 's not drinking . " How could she convince him that the alleviation of one symptom was far from a cure ? She 'd already seen in their family therapy sessions that Monroe was a man who saw resultsmuch more clearly than he saw causes . " Mr. Monroe , Joey is an alcoholic , will always be an alcoholic whether he drinks or not . He 's one of twenty-eight million children of alcoholics in this country . One third of them become alcoholics themselves , as Joey has . " " But he 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not . " She linked her fingers , laid them on the blotter , and tried again . " He is not consuming alcohol , he 's not altering hisp138reality with alcohol , but he has yet to deal with his dependency , and more importantly , the reasons for it . He is not getting drunk , Mr. Monroe , but the alcohol was a cover-up and an offshoot of other problems . He ca n't control or blanket those problems with liquor anymore , and now they 're overwhelming him . He shows no anger , Mr. Monroe , no rage , and very little grief , though it 's all bottled insideof him . Children of alcoholics often take on the responsibility for their parent 's illness . " Uncomfortable and impatient , Monroe shifted in his chair . " You 've explained that before . " " Yes , I have . Joey resents his father , and to a great extent he resentshis mother because both of them let him down . His father with his drinking , his mother with her preoccupation with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this resentment onto himself . " " Lois did her best . " " Yes , I 'm sure she did . She 's a remarkably strong woman . Unfortunately , Joey does n't have her strength . Joey 's depression has reached a dangerous stage , a critical stage . I ca n't tell even you what was discussedor what was said in our recent sessions , but I can tell you I 'm more concerned than ever over his emotional state . He 's in such pain . At this point I 'm doing little more than soothing the pain so that he can get through the week until I can soothe it again . Joey feels his life is worthless , that he 's failed as a son , as a friend , as a person . " " The divorce  --  " " Divorce batters the children involved . The extent of which depends on the state of mind the children are in at the time , the way the divorce is handled , the emotional strength of the individual child . For some it can be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grief , of bitterness , even of denial . Self-blame is common . Mr. Monroe , it 's been nearly three years since your wife separated from Joey 's father . His obsession with the divorce and his part in it is n't normal . It 's become a springboard for all of his problems . " She paused a moment , and linked her hands together again . " His alcoholism is painful . Joey feels he deserves the pain . In fact , he appreciates it in the way a small child appreciates being disci/plined for breaking the rules . The discipline , the pain , makes him feel a part of society , while at the same time , the alcoholism itself makes Joey feel isolated from society . He 's learned to depend on this isolation , on seeing himself as different , not quite as good as everyone else . Particularly you . " " Me ? I do n't understand . " " Joey identifies with his father , a drunk , a failure both in business and in family life . You are everything his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him wants to cut himself off from his father and model himself on you . The rest of him simply does n't feel worthy , and he 's afraid to risk another failure . It 's gone beyond that even , Mr. Monroe . Joey is fast reaching a point where he 's too tired to bother at all with life . " His fingers were clenching and unclenching . When he spoke , it was his calm , board of director 's voice . " I do n't follow you . " " Suicide is the third highest cause of death among teenagers , Mr. Monroe . Joey has definite suicidal tendencies . He 's already playing with the idea , circling around it with his fascination with the occult . It would take very little at this point in his life to push him over the line  --  an argument that leaves him feeling rebellious , a test in school that makes him feel inadequate . His father 's ambivalent behavior . " Though her voice was calm , the underlying urgency was communicatingto him . Tess leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Monroe , I ca n't stress how vital it is that Joey begin structured , intensified treatment . You trusted me enough to bring him here , to allow me to treat him . You have to trust me enough to believe me when I say I 'm not enough for him . I have information here on the clinic . " She pushed a folder across the desk . " Please discussthis with your wife , ask her to come in and talk it over with me . I 'll rearrange my schedule so that we can meet any time it 's convenient . But , please , make it soon . Joey needs this , and he needs it now , before something pushes him over . " He took the folder , but did n't open it . " You want us to send Joey to a place like this , but you did n't want us to have him change schools . " " No , I did n't . " She wanted to pull the pins out of her hair , runp140her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At that time I felt , I hoped , I could still reach him . Since September Joey 's been pulling away more and more . " " He saw the change in schools as another failure , did n't he ? " " Yes . I 'm sorry . " " I knew it was a mistake . " He let out a long breath . " When Lois was making the arrangements to transfer him , he looked at me . It was as if he was saying , please , give me a chance . I could almost hear him . But I backed her up . " " There 's no blame here , Mr. Monroe . You and your wife are dealing with a situation where there are no easy answers . There is no absolute right or wrong . " " I 'll take the papers home . " He rose then , slowly , as though the folder in his hand were weighty and leaden . " Dr. Court , Lois is pregnant . We have n't told Joey . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighed how this news might affect her patient . " I think it would be nice if you told him together , making it a family affair . The three of you are expecting a baby . It would be very important to Joey to be made to feel included rather than replaced . A baby , the anticipation of a baby , can bring a great deal of love into a family . " " We 've been afraid he might resent it  --  us . " " He might . " Timing , she thought  --  emotional survival could so often depend on timing . " The more he 's brought into the process , into the planning , the more he 'll feel a part of it . Do you have a nursery ? " " We have a spare bedroom we thought we might redecorate . " " I imagine Joey would be pretty good with a paintbrush , given the chance . Please call me after you 've discussed the clinic . I 'd like to go over it with Joey myself , perhaps take him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right . Thank you , Doctor . " Tess closed the door behind him , then pulled out the pins in her hair . The band of tension eased , leaving only a dull ache . She was n't sure she could rest easy until Joey was being treated in the clinic . At least they were turning in the right direction , she told her/self . Monroe had n't been enthusiastic about her suggestion , but she believed he would push for it . Tess locked away Joey 's file and his tapes , holding on to the cassettefrom their last session a moment longer . He 'd spoken of death twice during the session , both times in a matter-of-fact way . He had n't termed it as dying but as opting out . Death as a choice . She kept the last tape out , and decided to phone the director of the clinic in the morning . When her phone rang she nearly groaned . She could leave it . Her answering service would pick it up after the fourth ring and contact her if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tape in her hand as she crossed over and picked it up . " Hello , Dr. Court . " In the silence that followed she heard labored breathing and the sounds of traffic . Automatically she pulled a pad over and picked up a pencil . " This is Dr. Court . Can I help you ? " " Can you ? " The voice was only a whisper . She heard not the panic she was half expecting , but despair . " I can try . Would you like me to ? " " You were n't there . If you 'd been there , it might have been different . " " I 'm here now . Would you like to see me ? " " Ca n't . " She heard the deep , gulping sob . " You 'd know . " " I can come to you . Why do n't you tell me your name and where you are ? " She heard the click . Less than a block away , the man in the dark coat leaned against the pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tess glanced down at the notes she 'd made of the conversation . If he 'd been a patient , she had n't recognized his voice . On the off chance that the phone would ring again , she stayed anotherfifteen minutes , then gathered up her work and left the office . Frank Fuller was waiting in the hall . " Well , there she is . " He slipped his breath spray back into hispocket . " I was beginning to think you 'd moved out of the building . " Tess glanced back at her door . Her name and profession werep142neatly printed on it . " No , not yet . Working a bit late tonight , Frank ? " " Oh , you know how it goes . " Actually , he 'd spent the last hour trying to drum up a date . He had n't been successful . " Apparently this police-consultant business has kept you pretty tied up . " " Apparently . " Even for someone whose manners were as ingrainedas Tess 's , small talk after the day she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the phone call as she waited for the elevator . " You know , Tess . . . " He used his old trick of resting his hand against the wall and surrounding her . " You might find it beneficial , professionally speaking , to consult with a colleague on this . I 'd be glad to make some room on my calendar . " " I appreciate that , Frank , but I know how busy you are . " When the elevator doors slid open , she stepped inside . She pressed the button for the ground floor and shifted her briefcase as he stepped in beside her . " Never too busy for you , Tess , professionally or otherwise . Why do n't we discuss it over drinks ? " " I 'm afraid I 'm not at liberty to discuss it at all . " " We can find something else to discuss then . I have this bottle of wine , a cocky little Zinfandel I 've been saving for the right occasion . Why do n't we go back to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet ? " So he could start nibbling her toes , Tess thought , and sent up a quiet prayer of thanksgiving when the doors opened again . " No thanks , Frank . " She made tracks across the lobby , but did n't shake him . " Why do n't we stop in at the Mayflower , then , a quiet drink , a little music , and no shop talk ? " Champagne cocktails at the Mayflower . Ben had told her that was her style . Perhaps it was time to prove to him , and Frank Fuller , that it was n't . " The Mayflower 's a bit staid for my taste , Frank . " She flipped up her collar as they stepped into the chilly darkness of the parking lot . " But in any case , I have n't the time for socializing . Youp143should try that new club around the corner , Zeedo 's . From what I hear , it 's almost impossible not to score if you dig in for the evening . " She pulled out her keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How do you know about  --  " " Frank . " She clucked her tongue then patted his cheek . " Grow up . " Delighted with herself and his astounded expression , she slid into the car . She glanced over her shoulder as she reversed , but barely spared a glance at the man standing in the shadows at the edge of the lot . She 'd hardly gotten through the door and shed her coat and shoes , when someone knocked . If it was Frank , she 'd stop being polite , Tess promised herself , and give it to him right between the eyes . Senator Jonathan Writemore stood in his Saville Row overcoat , holding a red cardboard box of chicken and a slim paper bag . " Grandpa . " Most of the tension Tess had n't been aware of havingslipped away . She drew a deep breath and all but tasted the spices . " I hope you 're not on your way to a hot date . " " I 'm on my way right here . " He dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still hot , little girl . I got extra spicy . " " My hero . I was about to fix myself a cheese sandwich . " " Figures . Get the plates , and plenty of napkins . " She slipped into the kitchen , setting the chicken on the table asshe went by . " Does this mean I 'm not invited to dinner tomorrow ? " " This means you eat two decent meals this week . Do n't forgetthe corkscrew . I have a bottle of wine here . " " As long as it 's not Zinfandel . " " What ? " " Never mind . " Tess returned carrying plates , linen napkins , two of her best wineglasses , and a corkscrew . She set the table , lit the candles , then turned to give her grandfather a bear hug . " I 'm so glad to see you . How did you know I needed a boost tonight ? " " Grandfathers are born knowing . " He kissed both her cheeks , then scowled at her . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor . "  |p144He  gave her a swat on the rear . " Just sit down , little girl . " He turned his attention to the wine bottle when she obeyed . Tess lifted the lid while he dealt with the cork . " Give me one of those chicken tits . " She giggled like a girl , and placed the fast food on her mother 's best English bone china . " Think how shocked your constituents would be if they heard you talking about chicken tits . " She chose a drumstick and was delighted to discover a box of fries . " How 's the Senate business ? " " It takes a lot of shit to grow flowers , Tess . " He drew the cork . " I 'm still lobbying to get the Medicaid Reform bill passed . I do n't know if I can pull off enough support before we adjourn for the holidays . " " It 's a good bill . It makes me proud of you . " " Flatterer . " He poured her wine , then his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat fries without ketchup . No , do n't get up , I 'll get it . When 's the last time you 've been to the store ? " he asked the minute he opened the refrigerator . " Do n't start , " she said , and took a bite of chicken . " Besides , you know I 'm the expert on takeout and eat-ins . " " I do n't like to think of my only granddaughter forever eating out of a carton . " He came back in with a bottle of ketchup , easily ignoring the fact that they were both eating out of a carton . " If I was n't here , you 'd be over at that desk with a cheese sandwich and a stack of files . " " Did I say I was glad to see you ? " Tess lifted her wineglass and smiled at him . " You 're overworking . " " Maybe . " " How about I buy two tickets for Saint Croix and we take off the day after Christmas ? Have ourselves a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I 'd love to , but the holidays are the roughest on some of my patients . I have to be here for them . " " I 've been having second thoughts . " " You ? " Bypassing the ketchup , she began to nibble on fries and wondered if she had room for a second piece of chicken . " About what ? "  | " Getting you involved with these homicides . You 're looking worn out . " " It 's only partly that . " " Having a problem with your sex life ? " " Privileged information . " " Seriously , Tess , I 've spoken with the mayor . He 's told me how involved you are with the police investigation . All I had in mind was the profile , maybe showing off my smart granddaughter a bit . " " Vicarious thrills , huh ? " " The thrill takes on a different complexion after the fourth murder . Only two blocks from here . " " Grandpa , that would have happened whether I was involved with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be involved . " She thought of Ben , his accusations , his resentment . She thought of her own well-ordered life and the sudden small twinges of dissatisfaction . " Maybe I need to be involved . Things have been pretty cut and dried for me up to now in my life , and my career . My part in this has shown me a different aspect of myself , and of the system . " She took up her napkin , but only kneaded it in her hands . " The police are n't interested in the workings of his mind , in his emotional motivation , yet they 'll use the knowledge to try to catch him , and to punish him . I 'm not interested in seeing him punished , yet I 'll use what I can learn of his mind , his motivation , to try to have him stopped and helped . Which of us is right , Grandpa ? Is justicepunishment or is it treatment ? " " You 're talking to a lawyer of the old school , Tess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is entitled to representation and a fair trial . The lawyer might not believe in the client , but he has to believe in the law . The law says that this man has the right to be judged by the system . And usually the system works . " " But does the system , the law , understand the diseased mind ? " Shaking her head , she set the napkin down again , recognizing her kneading as nerves . " Not guilty by reason of insanity . Should n't it be not responsible ? Grandpa , he is guilty of murdering those women . But responsible , no . " " He 's not one of your patients , Tess. "  | " Yes , he is . He has been all along , but I did n't understand that until last week  --  the last murder . He has n't asked me for help yet , but he will be asking for it . Grandpa , do you remember what you said to me the day I opened my office ? " He studied her , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candlelight made her beautiful . She was his little girl . " Probablysaid too many things . I 've been alive a long time . " " You said that I 'd chosen a profession that would allow me into people 's minds , and that I could never forget their hearts . I have n't forgotten . " " I was proud of you that day . I still am . " She smiled and picked up her napkin . " You 've got ketchup on your chin , Senator , " she murmured , and wiped it off . UH RE E AND A HALF miles away Ben and Ed had had morethan one drink . The club was decorated with wine bottles , had its fair share of regulars and a blind piano player who sang low-key rock . His tip jar was only half full , but the evening was young . Their table was roughly the size of a place mat squeezed in among a line of others . Ed worked his way through a pasta salad . Ben settled on the beer nuts . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nod at Ed 's plate . " You turn into a yuppie . " " Ca n't be a yuppie if you do n't drink white wine . " " Sure ? " " Absolutely . " Taking him at his word , Ben plucked up a rotini noodle . " What was the word when you called in ? " Ben picked up his glass and watched a woman in a short leather skirt slide past their table . " Rigsby went by the drugstore where he bought the money order . Nothing . Who 's going to remember a guy buying a money order three months ago ? Are n't you going to put any salt on that ? " " Are you kidding ? " Ed signaled for another round . Neither of them were drunk yet , but not for lack of trying.  | " You going over to Kinikee 's Saturday to watch the game ? " " I 've got to look at apartments . I 've got to be out by the first of December . " " You should forget an apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . " Rent money 's money down the tube . You ought to be thinking about buying your own place , investing your money . " " Buying ? " Ed picked up a spoon and stirred his drink . " You mean a house ? " " Sure . You 've got to be crazy to toss money out the window every month on rent . " " Buy ? You thinking of buying a house ? " " On my salary ? " Ben laughed and tipped the chair back the full inch he had . " Last I looked , I was bringing home the same as you . " " I tell you what you need to do , partner . You need to get married . " Ed said nothing , but drained half his drink . " I 'm serious . You find a woman , make sure she has a good job  --  I mean , like a career , so she wo n't be thinking about dumping it after . It would help if you found one you did n't mind looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your salaries , you buy a house , and you stop throwing away rent money . " " They 're turning my apartment building into condos , so I have to get married ? " " That 's the system . Let 's ask an unbiased parry . " Ben leaned over to the woman beside him . " Excuse me , but do you believe with today 's social and economic climate that two can live as cheaply as one ? In fact , considering the buying power of a two-income family , that two can almost always live more cheaply than one ? " The woman set down her spritzer and gave Ben a considering look . " Is this a pickup ? " " No , this is a random poll . They 're turning my partner 's apartmentinto a condo . " " The dirty bastards did the same thing to me . Now it takes me twenty minutes on the Metro to get to work . " " You have a job ? " " Sure . I manage Women 's Better Dresses at Woodies. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Here you go , Ed . " Ben leaned toward him . " Your future bride . " " Have another drink , Ben . " " You 're blowing a perfect opportunity . Why do n't we switch places so you can . . . " He trailed off as he spotted the man approachingtheir table . Instinctively he straightened in his chair . " Evening , Monsignor . " Ed turned and saw Logan just behind him , wearing a gray sweater and slacks . " Nice to see you again , Monsignor . Want to squeeze in ? " " Yes , if I 'm not interrupting . " Logan managed to draw a chair up to the corner of the table . " I called the station and they told me you 'd be here . I hope you do n't mind . " Ben ran a finger up and down the side of his glass . " What can we do for you , Monsignor ? " " You can call me Tim . " Logan signaled to the waitress . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a St. Pauli Girl , and bring another round for my associates . " Logan glanced over as the piano player went into one of Billy Joel 's ballads . " I do n't have to ask if you two have had a hard day . I 've been in contact with Dr. Court , and I had a brief discussion with your captain a couple of hours ago . You 're trying to pin down a Francis Moore . " " Trying 's the word . " Ed pushed aside his empty plate so the waitress would clear it when she served the drinks . " I knew a Frank Moore . Used to teach in seminary down here . Old school . Unshakable faith . The kind of priest I imagine you 're more accustomed to , Ben . " " Where is he ? " " Oh , in God 's light , I 'm sure . " He picked up a handful of nuts . " He died a couple of years ago . Bless you , child , " Logan said when his beer was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a raving fanatic , he simply was n't flexible . Today we have a lot of young priests who question and search , who debate such horny  --  you should forgivethe pun  --  issues as celibacy and a woman 's right to give the sacraments . It was easier for Frank Moore , who saw things in blackp149and white . A man of the cloth does n't lust for wine , women , or silk underwear . Cheers . " He lifted his glass and drained what was left of the beer . " I 'm telling you this because I thought I might tug on a few connections , talk to some people who would remember Frank and some of the students under him . I did some counseling at the seminary myself , but that was nearly ten years ago . " " We 'll take what we can get . " " Good . Now that that 's settled , I think I 'll have another beer . " He caught the waitress 's eye , then turned back to smile at Ben . " How many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Twelve . " " The whole route . I 'm sure the good sisters gave you an admirablefoundation . " " And a few good shots across the knuckles . " " Yes , bless them . They are n't all Ingrid Bergmans . " " No . " " I do n't have much in common with Pat O'Brien myself . " Loganhefted his fresh beer . " Of course , we 're both Irish . Lecheim . " " Father Logan  --  Tim , " Ed quickly corrected . " Can I ask you a religious question ? " " If you must . " " If this guy , any guy , came to you in the confessional and told you he 'd done someone , murdered someone , would you turn him in ? " " That 's a question I can answer equally as a psychiatrist and as a priest . They 're are n't many . " He studied his beer a moment . There were times when Logan 's superiors considered him too flexible , but his faith in God and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had committed a crime came to me in the confessional , or sought my professional help , I would do my best to persuade him to turn himself in . " " But you would n't push the button ? " Ben persisted . " If someone came to me as a doctor , or seeking absolution , they 'd be looking for help . I 'd see that they got it . Psychiatry and religiondo n't always see eye to eye . In this case they do . " There was nothing Ed liked better than a problem with more than one solution . " If they do n't see eye to eye , how can you do both ? "  | " By struggling to understand the soul and the mind  --  in many ways , seeing them as one in the same . You know , as a priest I could argue the subject of creation for hours , I could give you viable reasonswhy Genesis stands solid as a rock . As a scientist I could do precisely the same thing with evolution and explain why Genesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could sit here and say , what the hell difference does it make , we 're here . " " Which do you believe ? " Ben asked him . He preferred one solution , one answer . The right answer . " That depends , in a matter of speaking , on what suit I 'm wearing . " He took a long drink and realized if he had a third beer , he 'd be pleasantly buzzed . While enjoying the second , he began to look forward to the third . " Unlike what old Francis Moore used to teach , there are no blacks and whites , Ben , not in Catholicism , not in psychiatry , and certainly not in life . Did God create us out of his goodnessand generosity , and perhaps a sense of the ridiculous ? Or did we invent God because we have a desperate , innate need to believe in something larger , more powerful , than ourselves ? I argue with myself often . " He signaled for another round . " None of the priests I knew ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of his vodka . " It was right or it was wrong . Usually it was wrong and you had to pay for it . " " Sin in its infinite variety . The Ten Commandments were very clear . Thou shalt not kill . Yet we 've been warriors since before we could speak . The Church does n't condemn the soldier who defends his country . " Ben thought of Josh . Josh had condemned himself . " To kill one-to-one is a sin . To drop a bomb , with an American flag on it , on a village , is patriotic . " " We are ridiculous creatures , are n't we ? " Logan said comfortably . " Let me use a more simplistic example of interpretation . I had a young student a couple of years ago , a bright young woman who , I 'm embarrassed to say , knew her bible better than I could ever hope to . She came to me one day on the question of masturbation . " He turned a little in his chair and jogged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He turned back . " She had a quote , I 'm sure I wo n't get itp151quite right , but it had to do with it being better that a man cast his seed into the belly of a whore than to spill it onto the ground . A pretty strong stand , one might say , against , ah , self-servicing . " " Mary Magdalene was a whore , " Ed mumbled as the booze began to catch up with him . " So she was . " Logan beamed at him . " In any case , my student 's point was that the female has no seed to cast anywhere or to spill on the ground . Therefore , it must only be a sin to masturbate if you 're a male . " Ben remembered a couple of sweaty , terrifying sessions during puberty . " I had to say the whole damn rosary , " he muttered . " I had to say it twice , " Logan put in , and for the first time saw Ben relax with a grin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " I told her the bible often speaks in generalities , that she should search her conscience . Then I looked up the quote myself . " He took a comfortable drink . " Damned if I did n't think she had a point . "  |p152THE  GREENBRIAR ART GALLERY was a small , fussy pair ofrooms near the Potomac that stayed in business because people alwaysbuy the ridiculous if the price tag is high enough . It was run by a crafty little man who rented the ramshackle building for a song and promoted his eccentric reputation by paintingthe outside puce . He favored long , unstructured jackets in rainbowhues , with half boots to match , and he smoked pastel cigarettes . He had an odd , moon-shaped face and pale eyes that tended to flutterwhen he spoke of the freedom and expression of art . He tucked his profits tidily away in municipal bonds . Magda P. Carlyse was an artist who became trendy when a formerfirst lady had purchased one of her sculptures as a wedding presentfor the daughter of a friend . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too fond of the newlyweds , but Magda 's career had been launched . Her showing at the Greenbriar Gallery was a huge success . People crammed into the room dressed in furs , denim , spandex , and silks . Cappuccino was served in thimble-sized cups , along with mushroomp153quiches the size of quarters . A seven-foot black man wrapped in a purplecloak stood mesmerized by a sculpture of sheet metal and feathers . Tess took a long look at it herself . It made her think of the hood of a truck that had passed through a migration of unfortunate geese . " A fascinating combination of mediums , is n't it ? " Tess rubbed a finger over her bottom lip before she glanced up at her date . " Oh , absolutely . " " Powerfully symbolic . " " Frightening , " she agreed , and lifted her cup to disguise a giggle . She 'd heard of Greenbriar , of course , but had never found the time or the energy to explore this trendy little gallery . Tonight she was grateful for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm really delighted you thought of this . I 'm afraid I 've been neglecting my interest in popular , ah , art . " " Your grandfather tells me you 've been working too hard . " " Grandpa worries too much . " She turned away to study a twofootphallic tube that strained toward the ceiling . " But an evening here certainly takes your mind off everything else . " " Such emotion , such insight , " a man in yellow silk bubbled to a woman in sable . " As you can see , the use of the broken light bulb symbolizes the destruction of ideas in a society that is driven toward a desert of uniformity . " Tess shifted away as the man gestured dramaticallywith his cigarette then glanced at the sculpture he raved about . It had a G.E . seventy-five-watt bulb with a jagged hole just off center . The bulb was screwed into a plain wooden base of white pine . That was it , except for the fact that the little blue sticker indicatedit had been sold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Tess murmured , and was rewarded by a generous beam from Mr. Yellow Silk . " It is quite innovative , is n't it ? " Dean smiled down at the bulb as if he 'd created it himself . " And daringly pessimistic . " " Words escape me . " " I know just what you mean . The first time I saw it , I was struck dumb . "  |p154Deciding  against making the obvious comment , Tess merely smiled and moved on . She could do a paper , she thought , on the psychological implications  --  mass hysteria  --  that prompted people to actually pay for esoteric junk . She stopped by a glass square that had been filled with various size and colored buttons . Square , round , enameled , and cloth covered , they huddled and bumped together in the sealed box . The artist had called it " Population , 2010 . " Tess figureda Girl Scout could have put it together in about three and a half hours . The price tag read a whopping seventeen hundred fifty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to her date , when she saw Ben . He was standing by another display , his hands in his back pockets and a look of unconcealed amusement on his face . His jacket was open . Under it he wore a plain gray sweatshirt and jeans . A woman in five-thousand-dollars worth of diamonds swept up beside him to study the same piece of sculpture . Tess saw him mumble something under his breath . just before he glanced up and saw her . They stared as people passed between them . The woman in diamondsblocked the way for a moment , but when she walked on , neither of them had moved . Tess felt something loosen inside her , then grow tight and uncomfortable again before she made herself smile at him and nod in a friendly , casual greeting. " . . . do n't you agree ? " " What ? " She jerked herself back to Dean . " I 'm sorry , my mind was wandering . " A man who lectured hundreds of college students a year was used to being ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular sculptureshows the true conflict and eternal cycle of the man-woman relationship ? " " Hmmm . " What she saw was a jangle of copper and tin that may or may not have been welded into metallic copulation . " I 'm thinking of buying it for my office . " " Oh . " He was a sweet and absolutely harmless English professorwhose uncle played an occasional game of poker with her grandfather . Tess felt an obligation to lead him away from the sculpture , as a mother might lead a child whose allowance was hot in his handp155away from a shelf of plastic , overpriced model cars . " Do n't you think you should look around a bit , consider some of the other . . . " What did one call them ? " Pieces first ? " " The stuff 's selling like hotcakes . I do n't want to miss out . " He glanced around the sardine-packed room then began to edge toward the owner . Greenbriar was hard to miss in an electric-blue suit with headband to match . " Excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tess . " Cautious , calm , she looked up at Ben . The fingers around the miniscule handle of her cup dampened . Tess told herself it was the body heat in the overcrowded room . " Hello , Ben . How are you ? " " Terrific . " He was lousy , had been lousy for exactly one week . She stood in the midst of what he considered the pomp and the pompous and looked as cool and virginal as a vase of violets among a forest of orchids . " Interesting gathering . " " At least . " Then her gaze slid over to the woman at his side . " Dr. Court , Trixie Lawrence . " Trixie was an Amazon in red leather . In heeled boots , she stood an inch over Ben , with a mane of improbable red hair that exploded around her head in spikes , corkscrews , and kinks . The army of braceletson her arm jingled as she shifted . On her left breast was a tattoo of a rose that peeked out from the low V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offered her hand . " Hi . So you 're a doctor ? " For all her size , Trixie 's voice was only a breathless squeak . " I 'm a psychiatrist . " " No shit ? " " No shit , " Tess agreed as Ben made a business of clearing his throat . Trixie took one of the quarter-sized quiches and swallowed it like an aspirin . " I had a cousin in the loony bin once . Ken Launderman . Maybe you know him . " " No , I do n't think so . " " Yeah , I guess you see a lot of people with their batteries low . " " More or less , " Tess murmured , and glanced over at Ben . Nop156trace of embarrassment there , she noted . He was grinning like a fool . Her own lips twitched before she lifted her cup . " I 'm surprised to see you here . " Ben rocked back on the heels of worn tennis shoes . " Just impulse . I busted Greenbriar about seven years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invitation , I thought I 'd drop in and find out how he was doing . " He glanced over to see his host embrace the woman in diamonds . " Seems to be doing just fine . " Tess tasted her cooling cappuccino and wondered if Ben kept on such friendly relations with everyone he 'd arrested . " So , what do you think of the show ? " Ben looked over at the case of buttons . " Such blatant mediocrity , in a society that has singles ' night at the supermarket , is bound to be rewarded with tremendous financial gain . " He watched the light bloom in her eyes , wishing he could touch her . Just once . Just for a moment . " That 's what makes America great . " " You look terrific , Doc . " He yearned . It was the first time he believed he understood the true meaning of the word . " Thanks . " With the clear-minded intensity she had n't felt since childhood , she wished she looked terrific . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Trixie put in as she inhaled a plateful of quiches . " You 'll love it . " Ben 's smile faded a bit when he looked over Tess 's shoulder and saw the man she 'd been standing with before . " Friend of yours ? " Tess turned her head , then waited until Dean worked his way through the crowd . Her neck was long , slender , circled by pearls that made her skin seem only more delicate . Ben could smell her cool , quietly sexual scent over everything else . " Dean , I 'd like you to meet Ben Paris and Trixie Lawrence . Ben 's a detective with the local police . " " Ah , one of the city 's finest . " Dean gave him a hearty handshake . The guy looked like a cover of Gentlemen 's Quarterly and smelled like a Brut commercial . Ben had an irrational urge to grip his hand Indian-wrestle style and go a round . " You one of Tess 's colleagues ? "  | " No , actually I 'm on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It figured . Ben stuck his hands in his pockets again and took a small , telling step away from Tess . " Well , Trix and I just walked in . We have n't had a chance to absorb yet . " " It 's almost too much to take in in one evening . " Dean cast a proprietary eye at the mangle of copper beside him . " I 've just bought this piece . It 's a bit risque for my office , but I could n't resist . " " Yeah ? " Ben looked at it , then stuck his tongue in his cheek . " You must be thrilled . I 'm going to stroll around and see if I can pick up something for my den . Nice meeting you . " He slipped an arm around Trixie 's sturdy waist . " See you , Doc . " " Good night , Ben . " IT WAS STILL SHY of eleven when Tess stepped into her apartmentalone . The headache she 'd used as an excuse to cut the evening short had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasional dates with Dean . He was an undemanding , uncomplicated man , the kind of man she deliberately dated in order to keep her personal life equally undemanding and uncomplicated . But tonight she just had n't been able to face a late supper and discussion of nineteenth century literature . Not after the art gallery . Not after seeing Ben , she made herself admit , and slipped out of her shoes two feet inside the door . Whatever progress she 'd made in soothing her ego and alleviating the tension since that last morning she 'd seen him had been blown , quite simply , to smithereens . So she 'd start from scratch . A hot cup of tea . She took off her fur jacket and hung it in the hall closet . She 'd spend the evening in bed with Kurt Vonnegut , camomile , and Beethoven . The combinationwould take anyone 's mind off their problems . What problems ? she asked herself as she stood listening to the quiet of the apartment she came home to night after night . She had no real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A nice apartment in a good neighborhood , a dependable car , a light and consistently casual social life . That was precisely how she 'd planned things.  |p158She  'd taken step A , and made certain it led to step B , and so on until she 'd reached the plateau that satisfied her . She was satisfied . She took off her earrings and dropped them on the dining room table . The sound of stone hitting wood echoed dully in the empty room . The mums she 'd bought earlier in the week were beginning to go . Bronzed petals lay fading against the polished mahogany . Absently Tess picked them up . Their scent , sharp and spicy , went with her to the bedroom . She would n't look at the files on her desk tonight , she told herself as she pulled down the zipper of her ivory wool dress . If she had a problem , it was that she did n't allow herself enough time . Tonight she would pamper herself , forget about the patients who would come to her office on Monday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face the anger and resentment of drug withdrawal two afternoons next week . She 'd forget about the murder of four women . And she 'd forget about Ben . In the full-length mirror inside the closet , her reflection leaped out at her . She saw a woman of average height , slim build , in an expensiveand conservatively cut white wool dress . A choker of three strands of pearls and fat amethyst lay against her throat . Her hair was caught back at the temples with pearl-trimmed ivory combs . The set had been her mother 's , and as quietly elegant as the senator'sdaughter had been . Her mother had worn the choker as a bride . Tess had pictures in the leather-bound album she kept in her bottom dresser drawer . When the senator had given the pearls to his granddaughter on her eighteenth birthday , they had both wept . Every time Tess wore them , she felt both a pang and pride . They were a symbol of who she was , where she had come from , and in some ways , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight around her throat . She slipped them off , and the pearls lay cool in her hand . Even without them the image changed little . Studying herself , she wondered why she had chosen such a simple , such a suitable outfit . Her closet was full of them . She turned to the side and triedp159to imagine how she would look in something daring or outrageous . Like red leather . She caught herself . Shaking her head , she slipped out of the dress and reached for a padded hanger . Here she was  --  a grown woman , a practical , even sensible woman , a trained psychiatrist  --  standing in front of a mirror and imagining herself in red leather . Pitiful . What would Frank Fuller say if she went to him for analysis ? Grateful she could still laugh at herself , she reached for her warm , floor-length chenille robe . On impulse she bypassed it and took out a flowered silk kimono . A gift , rarely worn . Tonight she was going to pamper herself , silk against her skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea she took to bed with her . Tess put the choker on her dresser then pulled out the combs and lay them beside it . She turned down the bed and fluffed the pillowsin anticipation . Another impulse had her lighting the scented candles beside her bed . She drew in a whiff of vanilla before she headed toward the kitchen . The phone stopped her . Tess sent it an accusing glance , but went to her desk and picked it up on the third ring . " Hello . " " You were n't home . I 've waited such a long time , and you were n't home . " She recognized the voice . He 'd called her before , at her office on Thursday . The thought of a self-indulgent evening at home slipped away as she picked up a pencil . " You wanted to talk to me . We did n't finish talking before , did we ? " " It 's wrong for me to talk . " She heard him draw in a painful breath . " But I need ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said soothingly . " I can try to help you . " " You were n't there . That night you never came , you never came home . I waited . I watched for you . " Her head jerked up so that her gaze was frozen to the dark windowbeyond her desk . Watched . She shivered , but deliberately moved closer to look out at the empty street . " You watched for me ? "  | " I should n't go there . Should n't go . " His voice trailed off , as if he were talking to himself . Or someone else . " But I need . You 're supposed to understand , " he blurted out quickly , accusingly . " And I 'll try to . Would you like to come to my office and talk to me ? " " Not there . They 'd know . It 's not time for them to know . I have n't finished . " " What have n't you finished ? " There was only silence as he dragged his breath in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you more if you 'd meet with me . " " I ca n't , do n't you see ? Even talking to you is . . . Oh , God . " He began to mumble . Tess could n't understand . She strained her ears . Perhaps Latin , she thought , and put a question mark on the pad , circling it . " You 're in pain . I 'd like to help you deal with the pain . " " Laura was in pain . Terrible pain . She was bleeding . I could n't help her . She died in sin , before absolution . " The hand on the pencil faltered . Tess found it necessary to ease herself into the chair . When she found herself staring blindly at the window , she forced herself to look down at her pad again , and her notes . Training clicked into place , and she schooled herself to breathe deeply and keep her voice calm . " Who was Laura ? " " Beautiful , beautiful Laura . I was too late to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been given the power , and the duty . The will of God is hard , so hard . " He almost whispered here , then his voice becamestrong . " But just . The lambs are sacrificed and the clean blood washes sin away . God demands sacrifices . Demands them . " Tess moistened her lips . " What kind of sacrifices ? " " A life . He gave us life and he takes it . Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother , when suddenly a great wind came across the desert and smote the four corners of the house . It fell upon the young people and they smote them ; and I alone have escaped to tell you . ' I alone , " he repeated in the same terrible blank voice he had used to quote . " But after the sacrifices , after the trials , God rewards those who remain innocent . " As if she would be graded on them , Tess concentrated on mak/ing her notes clear and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does God tell you to sacrifice the women ? " " Save and absolve . I have the power now . I lost faith after Laura , turned my back on God . It was a blind , terrible time of selfishness and ignorance . But then He showed me that if I were strong , if I sacrificed , we would all be saved . My soul is tied to hers , " he said quietly . " We 're bound together . You did n't come home that night . " His mind was swinging back and forth . Tess could hear it in the shifts of his voice as much as in the content of his words . " I waited , I wanted to talk to you , to explain , but you spent the night in sin . " " Tell me about that night . The night you waited for me . " " I waited , I watched for the light in your window . It never came . I walked . I do n't know how long , where . I thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought it was you , but it was n't . Then I  --  I knew she must be the one .... I put her in the alley , out of the wind . So cold . It was so cold . Put her out of sight , " he said in a terrible hiss . " Put her out of sight before they could come and take me away . They are ignorant and defy the ways of the Lord . " His breath came in jagged gasps now . " Pain . Sick . My head . Such enormous pain . " " I can help the pain . Tell me where you are , and I 'll come . " " Can you ? " A frightened child being offered a night-light duringa storm . " No ! " His voice boomed out , suddenly powerful . " Do you think you can tempt me to question God 's will ? I am His instrument . Laura 's soul is waiting for the remaining sacrifices . Only two more . Then we 'll all be free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be feared , but damnation . I 'll watch for you , " he promised , almost humbly . " I 'll pray for you . " Tess did n't move when the phone clicked in her ear , but sat perfectlystill . Outside the stars were clear and close and bright . Cars moved by on the street at a sedate pace . Streetlights pooled onto the sidewalk . She saw no one , but wondered , as she sat near the window , if she was seen . There was sweat on her forehead , cold and sticky . She took a tissue from the corner of the desk and carefully dried it . He 'd been warning her . She was n't sure if even he was fullyp162aware of it , but he 'd called to warn her as much as to ask for help . She would be next . Her fingers trembled as they lifted to where the pearl choker had lain . She could n't swallow . Slowly , and with infinite care , she drew the chair back and eased out of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd put a hand to the curtain to draw it closed when the knock on her door made her slam back against the wall in an animal panic she 'd never before experienced . Terror swam into her as she looked around for a means of defense , a place to hide , a way to escape . She fought it back as she reached for the phone-911 . She had only to dial it , give her name and address . But when the knock came again , she looked at the door and saw she 'd forgotten to put on the chain . She was across the room in seconds , heaving her weight against the door and fumbling with the chain , which suddenly seemed too big and unwieldly to fit into the slot . Half sobbing , she threw it home . " Tess ? " The knock came again , louder , more demanding . " Tess , what 's going on ? " " Ben . Ben , oh , God . " Her fingers were even clumsier as she pulled to release the chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she yanked open the door and threw herself against him . " What is it ? " He felt her fingers dig into his coat as he tried to draw her back . " Are you alone ? " Instinct had him reaching for his weapon , closing a hand over it as he looked around for someone , anyone who might have tried to hurt her . " What happened ? " " Close the door . Please . " Keeping one arm around her , he closed it and dealt with the chain . " It 's closed . You 'd better sit down , you 're shaking . Let me get you a drink . " " No . Just hold me a minute . I thought , when you knocked , I thought ... " " Come on , you need some brandy . You 're like ice . " Trying to soothe , to stroke , he started to steer her toward the sofa . " He called me . " The fingers on her arm tightened as he turned her around top163face him . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand still gripped his coat . He did n't have to ask who . " When ? " " Just now . He called me at the office before , but I did n't realize it was him . Not then . He 's been outside . I saw him one night , on the corner , just standing on the corner . I thought I was being paranoid . A good psychiatrist knows the symptoms . " She laughed , then covered her face with her hands . " Oh , God , I have to stop this . " " Sit down , Tess . " He relaxed his fingers on her arm and kept his voice calm ; the same tone he 'd use to interrogate a shaky witness . " You got some brandy around here ? " " What ? Oh , it 's in the buffet there , the right door . " When she was sitting , he went to the buffet , what his mother would have called a server , and found a bottle of Remy Martin . He poured a double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drink some of this before you start over . " " Okay . " She was already pulling herself back , but drank to help things along . The brandy shot into her system and dulled the remainingfear . Fear had no place in her life , Tess reminded herself . Only clear thought and careful analysis . When she spoke again , her voice was level , without the bubble of hysteria . She gave herself only a moment to be ashamed of it . " Thursday night I had a late appointment at the office . When it was over and I was packing up for the day , I got a call . He sounded very troubled , and though I did n't think it was a current patient , I tried to draw him out a bit . I did n't get anywhere , he just hung up . " Brandy sloshed gently as she moved the bowl of the snifter around and around in her hands . " I waited a few minutes , but when he did n't call back , I filed it away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're sure it was the same man ? " " Yes , I 'm sure . The same man who called before . The same man you 've been looking for since August . " She sipped the brandy again , then set the snifter down . " He 's falling apart , rapidly . " " What did he say to you , Tess ? Tell me everything you remember . " I wrote it down . "  | " You  --  " He stopped and made a quick movement with his head . " Of course you did . Let 's have a look . " She rose , steady again , and went to the desk . Tess brought the yellow pad over and handed it to Ben . Here was something positive , something constructive . As long as she could think of it as a case , she would n't fall apart again . " I may have skimmed on a few words when he was talking quickly , but I got most of it . " " It 's in shorthand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " She started at the beginning , makingsure her voice was detached . Words were there to give the psychiatrista clue to the mind . She remembered that and pushed back the horror of knowing they 'd been directed at her . After the biblical quote , she stopped . " It sounds like the Old Testament . I imagine Monsignor Logan could place it . " " Job . " " What ? " " It 's out of Job . " His gaze was on the far wall as he lit a cigarette . Twice he 'd read the bible through , when Josh had been sick . Looking for answers , Ben remembered , to questions he had n't even formed . " You know , the guy who had everything going for him . " " And then God tested him ? " " Yeah . " He thought of Josh again , then shook his head . Josh had everything going for him , before ' Nam . " Too happy , Job ? How about some boils ? " " I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bible as well as he , she saw the parallel . " Yes , it makes sense . His life was well set , he was content , in all likelihood a good Catholic . " " Never had his faith tested , " Ben murmured . " Yes , then it was tested in some way , and he failed . " " The some way would have to do with this Laura . " He glanced down at the pad again , frustrated not to be able to read it himself . " Let 's have the rest . " As he listened to her read , Ben fought to think like a cop and not a man caught between infatuation and something deeper . A killer had been watching her . Ben 's stomach tightened into a mazep165of tiny knots . He 'd been waiting for her the night Anne Reasoner was killed , the night Tess had spent in his own bed . The cop recognizedthe warning as quickly as the doctor had . " He 's focused on you . " " Yes , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she tucked her legs up under her before she set the yellow tablet aside . It was a case . Tess knew it was vital to think of it , to analyze it as a case . " He 's drawn to me because I 'm a psychiatrist and part of him knows how desperately he needs help . And he 's drawn to me because I fit the physical description of Laura . " It had been the voice , she remembered , that had been the most frightening . The way it had swung from pitiful to powerful , in quietlydetermined madness . She folded her hands together , tight . " Ben , what I want you to understand is that it was like talking to two people . One of them was weepy , desperate , almost pleading . The other  --  the other was aloof , fanatical , and determined . " " He 's only one person when he strangles women . " He rose and walked toward the phone . " I 'm calling in . We 'll want to put a tap on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At the office ? Ben , I often talk to patients over the phone . I ca n't jeopardize their right to confidentiality . " " Do n't give me grief on this , Tess . " " You have to understand  --  " " No ! " He whirled to face her . " You have to understand . There 's a maniac out there killing women , and he decided to call you . Your phones get wired , with your permission or with a court order , but they get wired . Four other women did n't have the chance . Captain ? This is Paris . We got a break . " 44x4JT TOOK LESS THAN an hour . Two cops in suits and ties came in , did what seemed to be a few minor adjustments to her phone , and politely refused the offer of coffee . One of them picked up the receiver , punched a few numbers , and tested the tap . They took Tess 's spare key to her office and went out again . " That 's it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " These are the days of the microchip . I 'll take some of that coffee . " " Oh , sure . " With a last glance at the phone , she went into the kitchen . " It makes me feel exposed , knowing that whenever the phone rings , someone with a set of headphones is listening to everything I say . " " It 's supposed to make you feel protected . " When she came back in with the coffee , Ben was standing by the window , looking out . She saw him deliberately close the curtain when he heard her behind him . " I ca n't be sure he 'll call back . I was frightened , I 'm sure he sensed it , and dammit , I did n't handle it very well . " " I guess you lose your standing as supershrink . " He took the coffee , and her hand . " Are n't you having any ? " " No . I 'm already too wired up . " " You 're tired . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragile all at once , so pale and beautiful . " Look , why do n't you go in , get some rest ? I 'll bunk out on the couch . " " Police protection ? " " Just part of our campaign to improve community relations . " " I 'm glad you 're here . " " So am I. " He released her hand to run a fingertip down the closure of her silk kimono . " Nice . " " I 've missed seeing you . " The movement of his finger stopped . He looked at her again and remembered that earlier in the evening she 'd worn earrings , and a stone at her throat that had matched her eyes . And he 'd wanted to touch her so badly that it had hurt , bone deep . Now , as he had before , Ben backed off . " Got an extra blanket ? " She knew withdrawal when it smacked her in the face . As he had , she took a step back . " Yes , I 'll get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and stood straining against his own contradictions . He wanted her . He did n't want to get involved with anyone like her . She pulled at him . He pushed back . She was cool and lovely , in the way of pink-and-white delicacies behindp167bakery store windows . He 'd already had a taste of her , and knew certaindelicacies could be habit-forming . Even if he had room for her in his life , which he did n't , she would never fit . But he remembered again how she 'd leaned against his windowsill , laughing . She carried a blanket and pillow back in and began to make up the sofa . " You do n't act like you want an apology . " " For what ? " " For last week . " Though she 'd been determined not to mention it herself , Tess had wondered if he 'd bring it up . " Why would I want an apology ? " He watched her tuck the ends of the blanket neatly under the cushion . " We had a pretty fair argument going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know want to hear the old I 'm sorry I was a jerk . ' " " Were you ? " " Was I what ? " " A jerk . " He had to admit she 'd maneuvered him very nicely . " No . " " Then it would be foolish for you to say you were , just to holdup tradition . There , that should do , " she added as she gave the pillowa final fluff . " All right , dammit , I feel like an idiot about the way I acted the last time . " " You were an idiot . " Tess turned from the sofa to smile at him . " But it 's all right . " " I meant a lot that I said . " " I know you did . So did I. " Opposite sides , Ben thought . Opposite ends . " So where does that leave us ? " If she 'd known , she was n't sure she could have told him . Insteadshe kept her voice friendly . " Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all this . . . " Her gaze drifted to the phone . " Do n't dwell on that now . Let me take it from here . " " You 're right . " She linked her hands together , then pulled themapart . " If you think about something like this too much , you go  --  " " Crazy ? " he suggested.  | " To use a loose , inaccurate term . " She moved away then , tidyingthe desk to keep her hands busy . " I was surprised to see you tonight , at the gallery . I know it 's a small town , but  --  " It struck her then ; the confusion and panic had obscured it before . " What are you doing here tonight ? I thought you had a date . " " I did . I told her I had an emergency . I was n't far off . What about yours ? " " My what ? " " Your date . " " Oh , Dean . I , ah , told him I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't tell me why you came by . " He shrugged that off and picked up her paperweight , a crystal pyramid that ran with colors as he turned it . " Looked like a real upstandingcitizen . College professor , huh ? " " Yes . " Something began to settle inside of her . It took Tess a moment to recognize it as pleasure . " Your Trixie . Her name was Trixie , was n't it ? " " That 's right . " " She looked charming . Loved her tattoo . " " Which one ? " Tess only lifted a brow . " Did you enjoy the show ? " " I 'm fond of pretentious bullshit . Apparently , so 's your professor . Great suit . And that natty little tie bar with the little gold chain was so distinguished . " He set the paperweight down hard enough to make her pencils jump . " I wanted to push his nose into his forehead . " She beamed at him . " Thanks . " " Do n't mention it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup on the desk . It would leave a ring , but she said nothing . " I have n't been able to think of anything but you for days . Got a name for that ? " She met his angry look with a smile . " I like obsession . Such a nice ring . " She walked closer . There was no need for nerves any longer , or for pretenses . When his hands came up and took her shoulders , she continued to smile . " I guess you think this is pretty damn funny . " " I guess I do . And I guess I could take a calculated risk and tellp169you I 've missed you . I 've missed you a great deal . Would you like totell me why you 're angry ? " " No . " He pulled her against him , felt her lips curve then soften , then yield against his . The silk of her kimono rustled as his arms went around her . If he could have walked away , then he would have , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found himself at her door that it was already too late . " I do n't want to sleep on that frigging couch . And I 'm not leavingyou alone . " She made the effort to open her eyes , but for the first time inmemory she would have been willing to be swept away . " I 'll share the bed with you on one condition . " " Which is ? " " That you make love with me . " He drew her against him so that he could smell her hair , feelthe way it brushed over his skin . " You drive a hard bargain , Doc . "  |p170THE  SCENT OF COFFEE woke her . Tess turned from her sideto her back and lay dozing with the homey , comforting smell . How many years had it been since she 'd woken to the scent of coffee already brewing ? When she 'd lived in her grandfather 's house with its high ceilings and tiled foyer , she would come down the arching staircase in the mornings to find her grandfather already behind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the coffee already poured . Miss Bette , the housekeeper , would have set the table with the everyday dishes , the ones with the little violets around the edges . Flowers would have depended on the season , but they would always be there , jonquils or roses or mums in the blue porcelain vase that had been her great-grandmother 's . There would have been the quiet whoosh of Trooper 's tail , her grandfather 's old golden retriever , as he sat beneath the table hoping for a windfall . Those had been the mornings of her youth  --  steady , secure , and familiar  --  of her young womanhood , just as her grandfather had been the strong central figure in her life.  |p171Then  she had grown up , moved into her own apartment , into her own practice . She brewed her own coffee . With a sigh , she turned lazily , hoping for another dream . Then she remembered , and sat up straight in bed . It was empty , but for her . Pushing her hair out of her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed with her and kept the bargain . They had rolled and tossed and loved each other into the night until exhausted sleep had been the only alternative . No questions , no words , and the only answerhad been what they had both needed . Each other and oblivion . He 'd needed that too . She 'd understood that he 'd needed a few hours without tension , without puzzles , without responsibilities . Now it was morning , and each had a job to face . Tess rose , then slipped into the kimono that had been discarded onto the floor . She wanted a shower , a long , hot one , but she wanted the coffee more . She found Ben in the little el of her dining room , with a map of the city , a tangle of notes , and her own yellow tablet spread over the table . " Good morning . " " Hi . " He said it absently , then glanced up and focused . Though he smiled , she saw that his eyes were shadowed and intense as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated . " I was hoping you 'd sleep longer . " " It 's after seven . " " It 's Sunday , " he reminded her , then rose as if to separate her from what he was doing at the table . " Hungry ? " " Are you cooking ? " " Are you squeamish ? " " Not particularly . " " Then you can probably stomach one of my omelettes . Game ? " " Yeah , I 'm game . " She went with him into the kitchen and poured a cup of coffee . From the look of the pot , he 'd already had several . " Have you been up long ? " " Little while . How often do you shop for food ? " She glanced behind him , into the now open refrigerator . " When my back 's to the wall . " " Consider it there . " He pulled out a carton of eggs that was lessp172than half full and a miserly chunk of cheddar . " We can still manage the omelettes . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second shelf in the cabinet to your right . " He sent her a mild , pitying glance . " All you need 's a hot skillet and a light hand . " " I stand corrected . " She sipped coffee while he cooked . Impressive , she thought , and certainly better than she could do with gourmet utensils and a detailed recipe in front of her . Interested , she leaned over his shoulderand earned a silent stare . Tess split an English muffin , popped it in the toaster , and left the rest up to him . " It 's good , " she decided when they sat at the table and she 'd swallowed the first bite . " I 'm pretty pathetic in the kitchen , which is why I do n't keep a lot of food around that obliges me to deal with it . " He shoveled into his own with the easy enthusiasm of a man who considered food one of life 's top physical pleasures . " Living alone 's supposed to make you self-sufficient . " " But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tidy apartment , was obviously proficient at his job , and apparently had little trouble with women . Tess topped off her coffee and wondered why she was more tense now than when she 'd gone to bed with him . Because she was n't as handy with men as he was with women . And because , she thought , she was n't in the habit of sharing a casual breakfast after a frantic night of sex . Her first affair had been in college . A disaster . Now she was nearly thirty and had kept her relationshipswith men carefully in the safe zone . The occasional side trip had been pleasant but unimportant . Until now . " Apparently you 're self-sufficient . " " You like to eat , you learn how to cook . " He moved his shoulders . " I like to eat . " " You 've never married ? " " What ? No . " He swallowed hard , then reached for his half of the muffin . " It tends to get in the way of  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He grinned at her . " You butter a great muffin . " " Yes , that 's true . I 'd say another reason you 've never ... let 's say , settled is that your work comes first . " She glanced at the papers he 'd pushed to the end of the table . " Police work would be demanding , time-consuming , and dangerous . " " The first two anyway . Homicide 's sort of the executive end . Desk work , puzzle work . " " Executive , " she murmured , remembering very clearly the ease with which he had once strapped on his gun . " Most of the guys wear suits . " He 'd nearly polished off his omelette and was already wondering if he could talk Tess out of some of hers . " Generally , you come in after the deed 's been done and then put pieces together . You talk to people , make phone calls , push paper . " " Is that how you got that scar ? " Tess scooted the rest of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I told you before , that 's old news . " Her mind was too analytical to let it go at that . " But you have been shot , and probably shot at more than once . " " Sometimes you go into the field and people are n't too happy to see you . " " All in a day 's work ? " When he realized she was n't going to let it drop , he set down his fork . " Tess , it is n't like the flicks . " " No , but it is n't like selling shoes either . " " Okay . I 'm not saying you never run into a situation where things might get hot , but basically this kind of police work is on paper . Reports , interviews , head work . There are weeks , months , even years of incredible drudge work , even boredom as opposed to moments of actual physical jeopardy . A rookie in a uniform is likely to deal with more heat in a year than I am . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation , in the normal scheme of things , where you use your gun . " He did n't answer for a moment , not liking where the conversation was going . " What are you getting at ? "  | " I 'm trying to understand you . We 've spent two nights together . I like to know who I 'm sleeping with . " He 'd been avoiding that . Sex was easier if it wore blinders . " BenjaminJames Matthew Paris , thirty-five in August , single , six feet one-half inch , a hundred seventy-two pounds . " She rested her elbows on the table , setting her chin on her linked hands as she studied him . " You do n't like to talk about your work . " " What 's there to talk about ? It 's a job . " " No , not with you . A job is where you clock in every morning , Monday through Friday . You do n't carry your gun like a briefcase . " " Most briefcases are n't loaded . " " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His system was already primed . " I doubt many cops get around to collecting their pensions without drawing their weapons at least once . " " Yes , I understand that . On the other hand , as a doctor I 'd deal more with the results afterward . The grief of the family , the shock and trauma of the victim . " " I 've never shot a victim . " There was an edge to his voice that interested her . Perhaps he liked to pretend to her , even to himself , that the violent aspects of his job were occasional , an expected side effect . He 'd consider anyonehe shot in the line of duty , as he 'd put it , the bad guy . And yet she was sure there was a part of him that thought of the human , the flesh and blood . That part of him would lose sleep over it . " When you shoot someone in self-defense , " she said slowly , " is it like in a war , where you see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't think about it . " " I do n't see how that 's possible . " " Take my word for it . " " But when you 're in a situation that calls for that kind of extremedefensive action , you aim to wound . " " No . " On the flat answer , he rose and picked up his plate . " Listen , you draw your weapon , you 're not the Lone Ranger . There 's no grazing your silver bullet over the bad guy 's gun hand . Your life , your partner 's life , some civilian 's life is on the line . It 's black and white . "  |p175He  took the plates away . She did n't ask if he 'd killed . He 'd alreadytold her . She glanced at the papers he 'd been working on . Black and white . He would n't see the shades of gray she saw there . The man they sought was a killer . The state of his mind , his emotions , perhapseven his soul , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These papers , " she began when he came back . " Is there something I can help with ? " " Just drudge work . " " I 'm an expert drudge . " " Maybe . We can talk about it later . Right now I 've got to get moving if I 'm going to make nine o'clock Mass . " " Mass ? " He grinned at her expression . " I have n't gone back to the fold . We think our man might show up at one of two churches this morning . We 've been covering the masses at both of them since six-thirty . I got a break and drew the nine , ten , and eleven-thirty services . " " I ' 1l go with you . No , do n't , " she said even as he opened his mouth . " I really could help . I know the signs , the symptoms . " There was no point in telling her he 'd wanted her to come . Let her think she 'd talked him into it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She touched a hand to his cheek , but did n't kiss him . " Give me ten minutes . " THE CHURCH SMELLED OF candle wax and perfume . Thepews , worn smooth by the sliding and shifting of hundreds of clothcoveredhaunches , were less than half full for the nine o'clock service . It was quiet , with the occasional cough or sniffle echoing hollowly . A pleasant , religious light came through the stained-glass windows on the east wall . The altar stood at the head of the church , draped with its cloth and flanked by candles . White for purity . Above it hung the Son of God , dying on the Cross . Ben sat with Tess in the back pew and scanned the congregation . A few older women were scattered among the families towardp176the front . A young couple sat in the pew across from them , choosingthe rear , Ben thought , because of the sleeping infant the woman carried . An elderly man who had come in with the help of a cane sat alone , two private feet away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Sunday best sat and whispered together , and a boy of about three knelt backward on the pew and ran a plastic car quietly over the wood . Ben knew he was making the sounds of the engine and screeching tires in his head . There were three men sitting alone who fit the general description . One was already kneeling , his thin , dark coat still buttoned , though the church was warm . Another sat , passing idly through the hymnal . The third was in the front of the church , and sat unmoving . Ben knew Roderick had the front , and the rookie , Pilomento , was situated in the middle . A movement beside Tess had Ben stiffening . Logan slid in beside her , patted her hand , and smiled at Ben . " Thought I 'd join you . " His voice was a bit wheezy . He coughed quietly into his hand to clear it . " Nice to see you , Monsignor , " Tess murmured . " Thank you , my dear . I 've been a little under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I was hoping you 'd be along . You 'd have a sharp eye . " His gaze traveled around the half-empty church . Mostly the old and young , he thought . Those in the middle of their lives rarely thought God needed an hour of their time . After digging a Sucret out of his pocket , he looked at Ben again . " I hope you do n't mind my volunteering . If you happen to get lucky , I might be of help . After all , I have what we might call house advantage . " For the first time since Ben had met him , Logan wore the white clerical collar . Seeing it , Ben only nodded . The priest entered , the congregation rose . The service began . Entrance Rite . The Celebrant in green vestments , stole , alb , the amice worn harmlessly under the flowing robes , the gangly altar boy in black and white , ready to serve . Lord have mercy . A baby five pews up began to cry lustily . The congregation murmuredthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the cane was working his way through the rosary . The young girls giggled and tried desperately to stop . The little boy with the plastic car was shushed by his mother . A man with a white silk amice next to his skin felt the drummingin his head ease with the familiar flow of Celebrant and congregation . His palms were sweaty , but he kept them clasped in front of him . The Lord be with you . And with your spirit . It was the Latin he heard , the Latin of his childhood , of his priesthood . It soothed , and the world stayed steady . The Liturgy . The congregation sat with shuffles , murmurs , and creaks . Ben watched , not really hearing the priest 's words . He 'd heard them all so many times before . One of his earliest memories was of sitting on a hard pew , his hands between his knees , the starched collarof his best shirt rubbing against his neck . He 'd been five , or perhapssix . Josh had been an altar boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in his seat as if exhausted . Someone cheerfully blew his nose . " For the wages of sin is death , " the priest intoned , " but God 's gift is eternal life in Christ Jesus , our Lord . " The amice was cool against his skin , against his heart , as he murmured the response . " Thanks be to God . " They rose for the Gospel . Matthew 7:15-21 . " Be on your guard against false prophets . " Is n't that what the Voice had told him ? His head began to ring with the power of it as he sat very still . Excitement , fresh and clean , sang through his tired body . Yes , be on your guard . They would n't understand , they would n't let you finish . She pretended to understand . Dr. Court . But she only wanted to have him put in a place where he could n't finish . He knew the kind of place  --  white walls , all those white walls and white nurses with their bored and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those last terrible years . " Take care of Laura . She breeds sin in her heart and listens top178the devil . " His mother 's skin had been pasty , her cheeks flaccid . But her eyes had been so dark and bright . Bright with madness and knowledge . " You 're twins . If her soul 's damned , so is yours . Take care of Laura . " But Laura had already been dead . He heard the last of the gospel . It spoke to him . " Lord , Lord , who will enter into the kingdom of heaven , but he who does my heavenly Father 's will ? " He bowed his head , accepting . " Praise to you , 0 Christ . " They sat for the sermon . Ben felt Tess 's hand slip over his . He linked fingers , aware that she knew he was uncomfortable . He 'd resigned himself to sitting through Mass again , but it was a different story when a priest sat a foot away . It reminded him , clearly , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy and discovered , to his embarrassment , Sister Mary Angelina sitting in the pew ahead of his family . Nuns were n't as tolerant as mothers when little boys played with their fingers and hummed to themselves during Mass . " You were daydreaming during Mass again , Benjamin . " He remembered the trick Sister Mary Angelina had had of slipping her white hands into the black sleeves of her habit so that she looked like one of those egg-shaped , bottom-heavy toys you could n't knock down . " You should try to be more like your brother , Joshua . " " Ben ? " " Hmmm ? " " The man there . " Tess 's voice was light as a feather near his ear . " The one in the black coat . " " Yeah , I saw him before . " " He 's crying . " The congregation stood for the Creed . The man in the black coat continued to sit , weeping silently over his rosary . Before the prayer was finished , he rose unsteadily then hurried out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slipped out to follow . ' When she made a move to go with him , Logan pressed her hand . " Relax , Tess . He knows his job . " He did n't come back through the Offertory prayers or the wash/ing of hands . Tess sat with her hands clasped in her lap and her spine trembling . Ben knew his job , she agreed silently , but he did n't know hers . If they 'd found the man , she should be out with him . He 'd need to talk . She stayed where she was , acknowledging fully for the first time that she was afraid . Ben returned , his expression grim as he leaned over the back of the pew and touched Logan 's shoulder . " Could you come out here a minute ? " Logan went without question . Tess found herself taking a deep breath before she followed them into the vestibule . " The guy 's sitting out there on the steps . His wife died last week . Leukemia . I 'd say it 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out anyway , but  --  " " Yes , I understand . " Logan glanced toward the closed doors of the church . " I 'll take care of him . Let me know if anything changes . " He smiled at Tess and patted her hand . " It was lovely seeing you again . " " Good-bye , Monsignor . " They watched him walk outside into the crisp bite of the Novembermorning . In silence , they went back into the church . On the altar was the Consecration . Fascinated , Tess sat to watch the ritual of the bread and wine . For this is My body . Heads bowed , accepting the symbol and the gift . She found it beautiful . The priest , his vestments making him large and wide at the altar , held the round white wafer up . Then the gleaming silver chalice was consecrated and lifted as offering . As sacrifice , Tess thought . He had spoken at length of sacrifice . The ceremony she found beautiful , even a little pompous , would only mean sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , righteous , harsh , and thirsty for the blood of submission . The God of the Flood , of Sodom and Gomorrah . He would n't see the lovely ceremony as a bond between the congregation and a God of mercy and kindness , but as a sacrifice to the demanding . She reached for Ben 's hand . " I think he 'd feel . . . full here . " " What ? " She shook her head , not sure how to explain.  |p180From  the altar came the solemn words , " . . . as you were pleased to accept the offering of holy Abel and the sacrifice of our father Abraham , and that of your high priest Melchisedec , a holy sacrifice , a spotless victim . " " A spotless victim , " Tess repeated . " White for purity . " She looked at Ben with a dull horror . " Not saving . Not saving so much as sacrificing . And when he 's here , he twists all this so that it reinforces what he 's doing . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off this in the most unhealthy way . " She watched the priest consume the wafer , then after the sign of the cross , drink the wine . Symbols , she thought . But how far had one man taken them beyond symbols to flesh and blood ? The priest held up the host and spoke in a clear voice . " Behold the Lamb of God , behold Him who takes away the sins of the world . Lord , I am not worthy that You should come under my roof . Speak but the word and my soul will be healed . " Members of the congregation began to shift out of pews and shuffle down the aisle to receive communion . " Do you think he 'd take communion ? " Ben murmured , watchingthe slow-moving line . " I do n't know . " She suddenly felt cold , cold and unsure . " I think he 'd need to . It 's renewing , is n't it ? " The body of Christ . " Yeah , that 's the idea . " The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the altar . The other man Ben had watched kept his seat , with his head bent either in prayer or a light doze . There was another who felt the need and the longing rise up urgently inside him . His hands nearly trembled with it . He wanted the offering , the flesh of his Lord to fill him and wash away all stain of sin . He sat as the church filled with voices . " You 're born in sin , " his mother had told him . " You 're born sinful and unworthy . It 's a punishment , a righteous one . All of your life you 'll fall into sin . If you die in sin , your soul is damned . " " Restitution , " Father Moore had warned him . " You must makep181restitution for sin before it can be forgiven and absolved . Restitution . God demands restitution . " Yes , yes , he understood . He 'd begun restitution . He 'd brought four souls to the Lord . Four lost , seeking souls to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two more for full payment . " I do n't want to die . " Laura , in delirium , had gripped his hands . " I do n't want to go to hell . Do something . Oh , please , God , do something . " He wanted to clasp his hands over his ears , to fall on his knees at the altar and take the host into himself . But he was n't worthy . Until his mission was finished , he would n't be worthy . " The Lord be with you , " the priest said clearly . " Et cum spiri tutuo , " he murmured . JESS LET THE FRESHENING breeze outside play on her faceand revive her after over three hours of services . The frustration was back as she watched the stragglers from late Mass stroll to their cars ; frustration and a vague , nagging feeling that he 'd been close all along . She linked her arm with Ben 's . " What now ? " " I 'm going into the station , make a few calls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nodded to Tess , then sneezed three times into his handkerchief . " Sorry . " " You look terrible , " Ben commented , and lit a cigarette . " Thanks . Pilomento 's checking out a license plate . Said a guy across from him mumbled to himself through the last service . " He tucked the handkerchief away and shivered a bit in the wind . " I did n't know you 'd be here , Dr. Court . " " I thought I might be able to help . " She looked at his reddened eyes , sympathizing when he was wracked with a fit of coughing . " That sounds bad . Have you seen a doctor ? " " No time . " " Half the department 's down with flu , " Ben put in . " Ed 's threatened to wear a face mask . " Thinking of his partner , he looked back at the church . " Maybe they had better luck . " " Maybe , " Roderick agreed , wheezing . " You going in ? "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do me a favor . Go home and take something for that . Your desk 's upwind from mine . " " I 've got a report . " " Screw the report , " Ben said , then shifted as he remembered he stood a couple of yards from the church . " Keep your germs home for a couple of days , Lou . " " Yeah , maybe . Give me a call if Ed came up with anything . " " Sure . Take it easy . " " And see a doctor , " Tess added . He managed a weak smile and headed off . " Sounds to me like it 's heading into his lungs , " she murmured , but when she turned back to Ben , she saw his mind was already on other things . " Look , I know you 're anxious to make calls . I 'll take a cab home . " " What ? " " I said I 'll take a cab home . " " Why ? Tired of me ? " " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . " I know you 've got work you want to do . " " So come with me . " He was n't ready to let her go yet , or give up whatever private , uncomplicated time might be left of the weekend . " After I tie things up , we can go back to your place and ... " He bent down and nipped her earlobe . " Ben , we ca n't make love all the time . " With his arm around her , he walked to the car . " Sure we can . I 'll show you . " " No , really . There are biological reasons . Trust me , I 'm a doctor . " He stopped by the car door . " What biological reasons ? " " I 'm starving . " " Oh . " He opened the door for her then went around to the driver 's side . " Okay , so we 'll make a quick stop at the market on the way . You can fix lunch . " " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so you did . " She settled back , finding the idea of a cozyp183Sunday afternoon appealing . " All right , I 'll fix lunch . I hope you like cheese sandwiches . " He leaned close , so that his breath feathered over her lips . " Then I 'll show you what people are supposed to do on Sunday afternoons . " Tess let her eyes flutter half closed . " And what 's that ? " " Drink beer and watch football . " He kissed her hard , and started the car as she laughed . He watched them huddled together in the car . He 'd seen her in church . His church . It was a sign , of course , that she should come to pray in his church . At first it had upset him a little , then he 'd realizedshe 'd been guided there . She would be the last one . The last , before himself . He watched the car pull out , caught a glimpse of her hair through the side window . A bird landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with bright black eyes , his mother 's eyes . He went home to rest.  |p184THINK  I FOUND a place . " Ed sat solidly at his desk , hammering away two finger-style at his typewriter . " Oh , yeah ? " Ben sat at his own , the map of the city in front of him again . Patiently , he drew lines with a pencil to connect the murderscenes . " A place for what ? " " To live . " " Umm-hmm . " Someone opened the refrigerator and complained loudly that their A &; W had been stolen . No one paid any attention . The staff had been whittled down by the flu and a double homicide near Georgetown University . Someone had taped a cardboard turkey onto one of the windows , but it was the only outward sign of holiday cheer . Ben put a light circle around Tess 's apartment building before he glanced over at Ed . " So when are you moving ? " " Depends . " Ed frowned at the keys , hesitated , then found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract goes through . " " You having someone killed so you can rent their apartment ? "  | " Contract of sale . Shit , this typewriter 's defective . " " Sale ? " Ben dropped his pencil and stared . " You 're buying a place ? Buying ? " " That 's right . " Ed patiently applied Liquid Paper to his last mistake , blew on it , then typed the correction . He kept a can of Lysol spray at his elbow . If anyone who looked contagious walked by , he sprayed the area . " You suggested it . " " Yeah , but I was only  --  Buying ? " To cover his tracks , Ben pushed some excess paper into his trash basket on top of the empty can of A &; W. " What kind of dump can you afford on a detective 's pay ? " " Some of us know how to save . I 'm using my capital . " " Capital ? " Ben rolled his eyes before folding the map . He was n't getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to the station at large . " Next thing you know , you 'll be telling me you play the market . " " I 've made a few small , conservative investments . Utilities mostly . " " Utilities . The only utilities you know about is the gas bill . " But he studied Ed with an uncertain eye . " Where is this place ? " " Got a few minutes ? " " I 've got some personal time coming . " Ed pulled his report out of the typewriter , cast a wary glance over it , then set it aside . " Let 's take a drive . " It did n't take long . The neighborhood was on the outer and rougher edges of Georgetown . The row houses looked more tired than distinguished . The fall flowers had simply given up for lack of interest , and stood faded among tangles of unraked leaves . Someone had chained a bike to a post . It had been stripped down of everythingportable . Ed pulled up to the curb . " There it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To his credit , he did n't groan . The house was three stories high , and narrow , with its front door hardly five paces from the sidewalk . Two of the windows had been boarded up , and the shutters that had n't fallen off tilted drunkenly . The brick was old and softly faded , except for where someone had spray painted an obscenity . Ben got out of the car , leaned on the hood , and tried not to believe what he was seeing.  | " Something , is n't it ? " " Yeah , something . Ed , there are n't any gutters . " " I know . " " Half the windows are broken . " " I thought I might replace a couple of them with stained glass . " " I do n't think the roof 's been reshingled since the Depression . The real one . " " I 'm looking into skylights . " " While you 're at it you ought to try a crystal ball . " Ben stuck his hands in the pockets of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't have a key yet . " " Jesus . " With a mutter , Ben walked up three broken concrete steps , pulled out his wallet , and found a credit card . The pitiful lock gave without complaint . " I feel like I should carry you over the threshold . " " Get your own house . " The hall was full of cobwebs and droppings from assorted rodents . The wallpaper had faded to gray . A fat , hard-backed beetle crawled lazily across it . " When does Vincent Price come down the steps ? " Ed glanced around and saw a castle in the rough . " It just needs a good cleaning . " " And an exterminator . Are there rats ? " " In the basement , I imagine , " Ed said carelessly , and walked into what had once been a charming parlor . It was narrow and high ceilinged , with the openings of what would be two five-foot windows boarded up . The stone of the fireplacewas intact , but someone had ripped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust and grime , might very well have been oak . " Ed , this place  --  " " Terrific potential . The kitchen has a brick oven built into the wall . You know what bread tastes like out of a brick oven ? " " You do n't buy a house to bake bread . " Ben walked back into the hall , watching the floor for any signs of life . " Christ , there 's a hole in the ceiling back here . It 's fucking four feet wide . "  | " That 's first on my list , " Ed commented as he came to join him . They stood for a moment in silence , looking up at the hole . " You 're not talking about a list . You 're talking about a lifetime commitment . " As they watched , a spider the size of a man 's thumb dropped down and landed at their feet with a noticeable plop . More than a little disgusted , Ben kicked it aside . " You ca n't be serious about this place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a point he wants to settle down . " " You did n't take me seriously about getting married too ? " " A place of his own , " Ed continued placidly . " A workroom , maybe a little garden . There 's a good spot for herbs in the back . Aplace like this would give me a goal . I figure on fixing up one roomat a time . " " It 'll take you fifty years . " " I got nothing better to do . Want to see upstairs ? " Ben took another look at the hole . " No , I want to live . How much ? " he asked flatly . " Seventy-five . " " Seventy-five ? Seventy-five thousand ? Dollars ? " " Real estate 's at a premium in Georgetown . " " Georgetown ? Christ on a raft , this is n't Georgetown . " Somethingbigger than the spider skuddled in the corner . He reached for his weapon . " The first rat I see is going to eat this . " " Just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben 's shoulder . " Rats stick to the basement or the attic . " " What , do they have a lease ? " But he left his weapon secured . " Listen , Ed , the realtors and developers push back the borders so they can call this Georgetown and take idiots like you for **27;15165;TOOLONG . " " I only offered seventy . " " Oh , that 's different . You only offered seventy . " He started to pace but ran into a magnificent cobweb . Swearing , he fought himselffree . " Ed , it 's those sunflower seeds . You need red meat . " " You feel responsible . " Ed smiled , terrifically pleased before he strolled into the kitchen.  | " No , I do n't . " Ben jammed his hands into his pockets . " Yes , dammit , I do . " " That 's the yard . My yard . " Ed pointed out when Ben trailed after him . " I figure I can grow basil , some rosemary , maybe some lavender in that little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patch of knee-high grass nearly wide enough for two swipes of a lawn mower . " You 've been working too hard . This case is making us all loony . Ed , listen carefully to these words , see if they ring a bell . Dry rot . Termites . Vermin . " " I 'm going to be thirty-six . " " So ? " " I 've never owned a house . " " Hell , everybody 's going to be thirty-six once , but not everybody has to own a house . " " Shit , I never even lived in one . We always had apartments . " The kitchen smelled of decades of grease , but this time Ben said nothing . . " There 's an attic . The kind you see in shows where there 're trunks and old furniture and funny hats . I like that . I 'm going to do the kitchen first . " Ben stared out at the pitiful clump of grass . " Steam , " he said . " That 's the best way to strip this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ben pulled out a cigarette and grinned . " You 're going to need plenty of it . I dated this woman who worked at a paint store . Marli . . . yeah , I think her name was Marli . She 'd probably still give me a discount . " " Date anyone who works at a lumberyard ? " " I 'll check . Come on , I have to make a call . " They stopped at a phone booth a few miles away . Ben found a quarter and dialed Tess 's office number while Ed went into the 7-Eleven . " Dr. Court 's office . " " Detective Paris . " " Yes , Detective , just a moment . " There was a click , then silence , then another click . " Ben ? "  | " How are you , Doc ? " " I 'm fine . " As she spoke she was clearing her desk . " Just on my way out to the clinic . " " What time do you finish there ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his watch and shifted the rest of his schedule . " Fine . I 'll pick you up . " " But you do n't need  --  " " Yes , I do . Who 's on you today ? " " I beg your pardon ? " " Who 's watching you at the office ? " Ben explained , and tried to find a corner in the phone booth where the wind would n't reach . " Oh , Sergeant Billings . " " Good . " He cupped his hands around a match as he lit a cigarette , and wished like hell he 'd remembered his gloves . " Have Billingsdrive you to the clinic . " There was silence . In it he heard her temper , and was tempted to smile at it . " I do n't see any reason why I ca n't drive myself to the clinic as I 've done every week for the last several years . " " I 'm not asking you to see a reason , Tess . I 've got plenty of them . See you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd hold the phone , and her temper , until she could replace it quietly . She would n't want to do something as childish , and typical , as slamming it down . HE WAS RIGHT . TESS counted backward from five , slowly , then quietly replaced the receiver . She 'd hardly set it down when Kate buzzed her again . " Yes ? " It took effort not to bite the word off . " You have another call on line two . He wo n't give his name . " " All right , I  --  " The nerves in her stomach tangled , and she knew . " I 'll take it , Kate . " She stared at the slowly blinking button . Her finger was steady when she pushed it . " This is Dr. Court . " " I saw you in church . You came . "  | " Yes . " The instructions she 'd been given raced through her head . Try to keep him on the line . Keep him calm and on the line . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How are you feeling ? " " You were there . Now you understand . " " What do I understand ? " " You understand the greatness . " His voice was calm . A decision reached , faith confirmed . " The sacrifices we 're asked to make are so small compared to the rewards of obedience . I 'm glad you were there , so that you understand . I had doubts . " " What kind of doubts ? " " About the mission . " His voice dropped , as if even whispering of doubt was a sin . " But not anymore . " Tess took a chance . " Where is Laura ? " " Laura . " She could hear the tears . " Laura waits in purgatory , suffering , until I atone for her sins . She 's my responsibility . She has no one but me and the Blessed Mother to intercede for her . " So Laura was dead . Now she could be sure of it . " You must have loved her very much . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were joined before birth . Now I must make restitution for her before we can be joined after death . You understand now . You came . Your soul will join the others . I will absolve you in the name of the Lord . " " You ca n't kill again . Laura would n't want you to kill again . " There was silence . . . three , four , five seconds . " I thought you understood . " Tess recognized the tone , the accusation , the betrayal . She was going to lose him . " I think I do . If I do n't , I need you to explain things to me . I want to understand , I want you to help me understand . That 's why I want to come talk to you . " " No , it 's lies . You 're full of sin and lies . " She heard him begin to mumble the Lord 's Prayer before the connection was broken . WHEN BEN WALKED BACK into the squad room , Lowensteinwas standing by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against her ear so her hands would be free.  | " She ca n't keep away from me , " Ben told Ed . He started to slip an arm around her , not aiming for her waist , but for the bag of chocolate-covered raisins on her desk . " He called Court again , " Lowenstein told him . His hand froze . " When ? " " Call came through at 11:21 . " " The trace ? " " Yeah . " She lifted a pad from her desk and handed it to him . " They pinned it to that area . Had to be within those four blocks . Goldman said she did real good . " " Christ , we were just there . " He tossed the pad back on her desk . " We might have driven right past him . " " The captain 's sent out Bigsby , Mullendore , and some uniformsto comb the area and look for witnesses . " " We 'll give them a hand . " " Ben . Ben , wait . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouthpiece of the phone against her shoulder . " They 're sending up a transcript of the call for the captain . I think you 'll want to see it . " " Fine , I 'll read it when I get back . " " I think you 'll want to see it now , Ben . " A FEW HOURS ' WORK at the Donnerly Clinic was enough to take Tess 's mind off her own nerves . The patients there ranged from manic-depressive businessmen to street junkies who were withdrawing . Once a week , twice if her schedule permitted , she came to the clinic to work with the staff doctors . Some of the patients she would only see once or twice , others she would see week after week , month after month . She gave her time there , when she could , because it was n't an elite hospital where the rich came when their problems or addictionsbecame too much to cope with . Neither was it a street-side clinic run by idealists on a shoestring . It was a struggling and capableinstitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks of life.  |p192There  was a woman on the second floor with Alzheimer 's diseasewho sewed dolls for her grandchildren , then played with them herself when she forgot she had grandchildren . There was a man who thought he was John Kennedy and spent most of his day harmlesslywriting speeches . The more violent patients were kept on the third floor , where security was tighter . Thick glass doors were locked and windows were barred . Tess spent most of the afternoon there . By five she was nearly wrung dry . For the better part of an hour she 'd been in session with a paranoid schizophrenic who had hurled obscenities then his lunch tray at her , before he 'd ultimately been restrained by two orderlies . Tess had given him an injection of Thorazine herself , but not withoutregret . He 'd be on medication for the rest of his life . When he was quiet again , Tess left him to catch a few moments of quiet in the staff lounge . She still had one more patient to see : Lydia Woods , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held down a full-time job as a stock broker , and worked as president of the PTA . She had cooked gourmet meals , attended every school function , and had been named Businesswomanof the Year . The new woman , who could have and handleit all . Two months before , she had fallen violently apart at a school play . There had been convulsions , and a seizure many of the horrifiedparents had taken for epilepsy . When she 'd been taken to the hospital it was discovered she 'd been in a withdrawal as serious as one from heroin addiction . Lydia Woods had held together her perfect world with Valium and alcohol until her husband had threatened divorce . To prove her strength , she 'd gone cold turkey and had ignored her physical reactionsin a desperate attempt to keep her life as she had structured it . Now , though the physical illness was well under control , she was being forced to deal with the causes , and the results . Tess took the elevator down to the first floor , where she requestedLydia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm . Her room was at the end of the hall . Lydia had left the door open , but Tess knocked before going in.  |p193The  curtains were drawn , the room dim . There were flowers beside the bed , pink carnations . Their scent was light and sweet and hopeful . Lydia herself was on the bed , curled up to face the blank wall . She did n't acknowledge Tess 's presence . " Hello , Lydia . " Tess set the file on a small table and glanced around the room . The clothes Lydia had worn the day before were heaped in a corner . " It 's dark in here , " she said , and moved to the curtain . " I like it dark . " Tess glanced at the figure on the bed . It was time to push . " I do n't , " she said simply , then drew the curtain open . When light spilled in , Lydia rolled over and glared . She had n't bothered with her hair and makeup . There was a drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my room . " " Yes , it is . From what I hear you 've been spending too much time alone in it . " " And what the hell are you supposed to do around this place ? Weave baskets with the fruits and nuts ? " " You might try going for a walk on the grounds . " Tess sat , but did n't touch the file . " I do n't belong here . I do n't want to be here . " " You 're free to go any time . " Tess watched her sit up and light a cigarette . " This is n't a prison , Lydia . " " Easy for you to say . " " You signed yourself in . When you feel you 're ready , you can sign yourself out . " Lydia said nothing , smoking in brooding silence . " I see your husband was in to see you yesterday . " Lydia glanced at the flowers , then away . " So ? " " How did you feel about seeing him ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I loved having him come in here to see me looking like this . " She grabbed a handful of her unwashedhair . " I told him he should bring the kids so they can see what a pitiful hag their mother is . " " Did you know he was coming ? "  | " I knew . " " You have a shower in there . Shampoo , makeup . " " Are n't you the one who said I was hiding behind things ? " " Using prescription drugs and alcohol as a crutch is n't the same as making the effort to look nice for your husband . You wanted him to see you this way , Lydia . Why , so he 'd go away feeling sorry for you ? Guilty ? " The arrow hit home and started the blaze , as she 'd hoped . " Just shut up . It 's none of your business . " " Did your husband bring you those flowers ? They 're lovely . " Lydia looked at them again . They made her want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was her defense now . Picking up the vase , she hurled it and the flowers against the wall . From out in the hall where he 'd been told to wait , Ben heard the crash . He was out of his chair and heading toward the open door when a nurse stopped him . " I 'm sorry , sir , you really ca n't go in . Dr. Court 's with a patient . " Blocking his way , she went to the door herself . " Oh , Mrs. Rydel . " Ben heard Tess 's voice , cool and unruffled . " Would you bring a dustpan and a mop so Mrs. Woods can clean this up ? " " I wo n't ! " Lydia shouted at her . " It 's my room and I wo n't clean it up . " " Then I 'd be careful where I walked , so I did n't cut my feet on the glass . " " I hate you . " When Tess did n't even wince , Lydia shouted it more loudly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , I hear you very well . But I wonder if you 're shouting at me , Lydia , or yourself . " " Who the hell do you think you are ? " Her hand worked up and down like a jack hammer to crush out her cigarette . " You come in here week after week with your smug self-righteous looks and your pretty , upscale suits and wait for me to strip my soul . Well , I wo n't . Do you think I want to talk to some ice maiden who has her life all worked out ? Miss Perfect Society who treats basket cases as a hobby then goes to her just-so home and forgets about them . "  | " I do n't forget about them , Lydia . " Tess 's voice was quiet , a direct contrast , but in the hall , Ben heard it . " You make me sick . " Lydia heaved herself off the bed for the first time that day . " I ca n't stand the sight of you with your Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' perfection . " " I 'm not perfect , Lydia , none of us is . None of us has to be to earn love and respect . " The tears started , but Tess did n't rise to offer comfort . It was n't time . " What do you know about mistakes ? What the hell do you know about how I lived ? Dammit , I made things work . I did . " " Yes , you did . But nothing works forever if you refuse to allow for flaws . " " I was as good as you . I was better . I had clothes like yours , and a home . I hate you for coming in here and reminding me . Get out . Just get out and leave me alone . " " All right . " Tess rose , taking the file with her . " I 'll be back next week . Sooner , if you ask for me . " She walked to the door and turned . " You still have a home , Lydia . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mop . Tess took them and set them against the inside wall . " I 'll have them send down a fresh vase for those flowers . " Tess walked out the door and shut her eyes a moment . That kind of violent dislike , even when it came from illness and not from the heart , was never easy to take . " Doc ? " Tess shook herself back and opened her eyes . Ben was there , a few steps away . " You 're early . " " Yeah . " He came to her and wrapped a hand around her arm . " What the hell are you doing in a place like this ? " " My job . You 'll have to wait a minute . I have to enter some things in this file . " She walked down to the nurses ' station , checked her watch , and began to write . Ben watched her . Right now she seemed totally unaffected by the nasty little scene he 'd overheard . Her face was calm as she wrote in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he 'd seen that onep196quick unguarded moment when she 'd stepped into the hall . Not unaffected , but impossibly controlled . He did n't like it , just as he did n't like this place with its clean white walls and blank , miserable faces . She handed the file back to the nurse , in an undertone said a few things he assumed referred to the woman who 'd just berated her , then glanced at her watch again . " I 'm sorry you had to wait , " Tess said when she came back . " I have to get my coat . Why do n't you meet me outside ? " When she came out , he was standing at the edge of the grass , smoking steadily . " You never gave me a chance on the phone to tell you I did n't want you to bother with all this . I 've been getting myself to and from the clinic for a long time . " He dropped the cigarette and carefully crushed it . " Why did you take all that crap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she linked her arm with his . " Where are you parked ? " " That 's psychiatrist shit , answering questions with questions . " " Yes . Yes , it is . Look , if she did n't attack me , I would n't be doingmy job . It 's the first time we 've really gotten anywhere since I 've started seeing her . Now , where are you parked ? It 's cold . " " Over here . " More than happy to leave the clinic behind , he began to walk with her . " He called you again . " " Yes , right after you did . " She wanted badly to treat that with the same professional ease she had the patients in the clinic . " Were they able to trace it ? " " Narrowed it down to a couple blocks . No one saw anything . We 're still working on it . " " His Laura is dead . " " I figured that much out . " He put his hand on the car door , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out you 're his next target . " She did n't grow pale or shudder . He had n't expected her to . She simply nodded , accepting , then put her hand on his arm . " Would you do me a favor ? " " I can give it a shot . " " Let 's not talk about it tonight . At all . "  | " Tess  --  " " Please . I have to go to the station with you tomorrow and meetwith Captain Harris . Is n't that soon enough to hash all this over ? " He put cold , ungloved hands on her face . " I 'm not going to letanything happen to you . I do n't care what I have to do . " She smiled , lifting her hands to his wrist . " Then I do n't have anything to worry about , do I ? " " I care about you , " he said carefully . It was as close to a declarationas he 'd ever come with a woman . " I want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben . " She turned her lips into his palm . " And show me. "  |p198THE  MAINTENANCE MAN WAS glumly mopping up a mudcoloredpuddle in the hallway outside the squad room . Under the heavy scent of pine cleaner hung trails of more human odors . The machine that dispensed coffee black , coffee light , and when its mood was generous , hot chocolate , leaned like a wounded soldier against its companion which handled Hershey bars and Baby Ruths . A platoonof Styrofoam cups littered the tile . Ben steered Tess around the worst of it . " Coffee machine blow up again ? " The man with dusty gray overalls and dusty gray hair looked over the handle of his mop . " You guys got ta quit kicking these machines . Look at that dent . " He slopped more coffee and Lysol as he gestured . " Criminal . " " Yeah . " Ben sent a look of dislike at the candy machine . He 'd added a fresh dent there himself after he 'd lost another fifty cents the day before . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He led her into the squad room , where at eight o'clock phones were already shrilling . " Paris . " Lowenstein chucked a paper cup toward her trash bas/ket where it caught the rim and flipped in . " Captain 's daughter had her baby last night . " " Last night ? " He stopped by his desk to look for messages . The one from his mother reminded him that it had been nearly a month since he 'd checked in . " At 10:35 P.M. " " Shit , could n't she have waited a couple of days ? I had the fifteenthin the pool . " There was still a chance , he figured , if she 'd cooperatedand had a boy . " What 'd she have ? " " Girl , seven pounds , seven ounces . Jackson hit it on the nose . " " Figures . " She rose , giving Tess a quick professional sweep . Lowensteinjudged the price of the snakeskin bag in the ballpark of a hundred fiftyand felt a small , harmless tug of envy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . " " Ah , if you 'd like coffee or anything , we 're getting it out of the conference room until things are cleared up . We 'll be meeting in there in a few minutes . " The perfume was French , the real stuff , Lowenstein deduced as she took a quick , discreet sniff . " Thanks , I 'll wait . " " Why do n't you have a seat until the captain 's ready ? " Ben suggested , glancing around for a clean chair . " I 've got to return a coupleof these calls . " There was a sudden spurt of obscenities from the hall , then a metallic crash . Tess turned to see the dirty water from the bucket stream down the hall . Then all hell broke loose . A stringy black man with his hands cuffed behind him got as far as the doorway when a man in an overcoat caught him in a headlock . " Look at my floor ! " Almost dancing with fury , the maintenanceman jumped into view . He swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the union . See if I do n't . " The prisoner bucked and squirmed like a landed trout while the officer in charge tried to hang on . " Get that wet mop out of my face . " Panting and a bit red-faced , he tried to avoid the next showerhle the black man sent up a high keening wail , . " Shit , Mullendore , ca n't you control your prisoners ? " Withoutp200hurry Ben walked over to assist when the black man managed to sink his teeth into Mullendore 's hand . There was a low growl of a curse before the prisoner burst free and ran headlong into Ben . " Jesus , give me a hand , will you ? This guy 's an animal . " Mullendore made a grab , sandwiching the prisoner between them . For a moment they looked as though they were ready to rhumba . Then all three men lost their footing on the damp floor and went down in a heap . Beside Tess , Lowenstein watched with her hands comfortably on her hips . " Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The guy 's cuffed and weighs maybe a hundred pounds . They 'll just be a minute . " " You ai n't putting me in a cell ! " The black man rolled and squirmed and screamed , and managed to bring his knee solidly into Ben 's groin . In reflex , Ben jerked his elbow and caught him under the chin . As his body went limp , Ben collapsed on it , with Mullendorepanting beside them . " Thanks , Paris . " Mullendore held up his wounded hand to study the teeth marks . " Christ , I 'm probably going to need a shot . The guy went crazy when we walked into the building . " Ben managed to rise to his hands and knees . His breath whistledas he sucked it in , and left a hole burning in his gut . He tried to speak , dragged in another whistling breath , and tried again . " Sonofabitchput my balls into my stomach . " " I 'm real sorry about that , Ben . " Mullendore took out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real peaceful now , though . " With a grunt Ben pushed himself off to sit on the floor , braced by the wall . " For Christ 's sake get him into holding before he comes to . " He sat there as Mullendore hefted the unconscious prisoner . The cold , coffee-stained wash water had soaked through the knees and thighs of his jeans and splattered his shirt . Even when it soaked through the seat , he continued to sit , wondering why the knee that had connected with his pride had been so bony . As he headed down the hall for a fresh batch of soapy water , thep201maintenance man rattled his mop in his bucket . " I 'm talking to the shop steward . I had that floor almost finished . " " Tough break . " Ben spared him a look as the pain between his legs sang its way up to his head . " Do n't worry about it , Paris . " Lowenstein leaned on the doorway , carefully avoiding the small river . " Chances are you 're still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Honey , you know my husband 's a jealous man . " Tess crouched down beside him , giving him a sympathetic tuttut . Her hand was gentle as she patted his cheek , but her eyes were lit with laughter . " Are you all right ? " " Oh , I 'm terrific . I like absorbing my coffee through my skin . " " Executive branch , right ? " " Yeah , right . " " Want to get up ? " " No . " He resisted reaching a hand between his legs to make certain everything was in place . The laugh was n't quite muffled as she pressed a hand to her mouth . The long , narrowed look he gave her only made it worse . Her voice hitched and bubbled . " You ca n't sit here all day . You 're sitting in a puddle , and you smell like the floor of a cafe that has n't been washed over the weekend . " " Great bedside manner , Doc . " He took her arm as she fought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're down here with me . " " Then you 'd have all those guilt ramifications to deal with . Not to mention the cleaning bills . " Ed walked down the hall , still bundled in his outdoor gear . As he avoided the worst of the wet , he dug the rest of his breakfast yogurtout of the carton . Licking the spoon , he stopped in front of his partner . " Morning , Dr. Court . " " Good morning . " She rose , still swallowing laughter . " Nice day . " " Yes , a little cold though . " " Weatherman said it should hit fifty this afternoon . " " Oh , you two are a riot , " Ben told them . " A real riot . "  |p202Tess  cleared her throat . " Ben . . . Ben had a little accident . " Ed 's bushy brows lifted as he looked at the stream running down the hall . " Just keep your sophomoric humor to yourself , " Ben warned . " Sophomoric . " Ed rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed his empty carton to Tess , then hooking his hands under Ben 's armpits , hauled his partner effortlessly to his feet . " Your pants are wet . " " I was restraining a prisoner . " " Yeah ? Well , things like this happen in the midst of all that tensionand excitement . " " I 'm going to my locker , " he muttered . " Make sure the doctor has n't hurt herself laughing . " He sloshed , a little spread-legged , down the hall . Ed took the empty carton and plastic spoon from Tess . " Want some coffee ? " " No , " she managed , strangling a bit on the word . " No , I think I 've had enough . " " Give me just a minute , and I 'll take you in to Captain Harris . " THEY MET IN THE conference room . Though the heater sent out a hopeful mechanical buzz , the floors remained chilly . Harris had lost his annual campaign for carpet . The blinds were closed in a fruitless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poster urging America to conserve energy . Tess sat at a table , with Ed lounging beside her . The light scent of jasmine steamed out of his tea . Lowenstein balanced on the edge of a small desk , idly swinging one leg . Bigsby hunched in a chair , an economy-sized box of Kleenex on his lap . Every few minutes he blew his already red nose . Roderick 's flu had him in bed . Harris stood beside a green chalkboard on which the names and other pertinent information on the victims had been aligned in neat columns . A map of the city stretched over the wall , pierced with four blue flags . There was a corkboard beside that . Black-andwhiteglossies of the murdered women were tacked to it.  | " We all have transcripts of the phone calls Dr. Court received . " It sounded so cold , so businesslike , she thought . Transcripts . They could n't hear the pain or the sickness in transcripts . " Captain Harris . " Tess shifted her own notes in front of her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own opinions and diagnosis . But I feel it might be helpful if I explained these phone calls to you and your officers . " Harris , with his hands linked behind his back , only nodded . The mayor , the media , and the commissioner were snapping at his ankles . He wanted it over , long over , so he could spend some time doting on his new granddaughter . Seeing her behind the nursery window had almost made him believe that life had its points . " The man who contacted me called because he was frightened , of himself . He is no longer controlling his life , but is being controlled by his illness . The last . . . " Her gaze was drawn to the photograph of Anne Reasoner . " The last murder was not part of the plan . " She moistened her lips , glancing over only briefly as Ben walked in . " He was waiting for me  --  me specifically . We ca n't be certain how he focused in on the other victims . In the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her car broke down . He was there . In my case it 's much more fine-tuned . He 's seen my name and picture in the paper . " She paused a moment , expecting Ben to slip into the chair beside her . Instead he stayed back , leaning against the closed door , separated from her by the table . " The rational part of his mind , the part that keeps him functioningon a daily basis , was drawn . Here was help , someone who has n't condemned him out of hand . Someone who claims to understandat least some of the pain . Someone who looks enough like his Laura to trigger feelings of love and complete despair . " I think it 's accurate to say that he waited for me the night of Anne Reasoner 's murder because he wanted to talk to me , to explain why before he . . . before he did what he 's being driven to do . From your own investigations I think it 's also accurate to say that he did n't feel this need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see that time and time again he asks me to understand.  |p204I  'm a hinge at this point . His door is swinging both ways . " She put her palms together , moving them back and forth to demonstrate . " He 's asking for help , then his illness takes over and he only wants to finish what he 's started . Two more victims , " she said calmly . " Or in his mind , two more souls to be saved . Me , then himself . " Ed made small , neat notes in the margin of his transcripts . " What 's to stop him from going off , taking someone else down because he ca n't get to you ? " " He needs me . At this point he 's contacted me three times . He 's seen me in church . He deals in signs and symbols . I was in church  --  his church . I resemble his Laura . I 've told him I want to help . The closer he feels to me , the more necessary it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You still think he 'll target for December eighth ? " Lowenstein had the transcript in her hands , but she was n't looking at it . " Yes . I do n't think he could break pattern again . Anne Reasoner took too much out of him . The wrong woman , the wrong night . " Tess 's stomach shuddered once before she drew herself straight and controlled it . " Is n't it possible , " Ed began , " that because he 's homed in on you this way , that he could go for you sooner ? " " It 's always possible . Mental illness has few absolutes . " " We 'll be continuing our twenty-four hour protection , " Harris put in . " You 'll have the wire on your phone and the guards until he 's caught . In the meantime , we want you to continue your office and personal routine . He 's been watching you , so he 'll know what they are . If you look accessible , we might draw him out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " From the door Ben spoke quietly . His hands were in his pockets , his voice relaxed . Tess only had to look in his eyes to see what was going on inside . " You want her for bait . " Harris stared back . His voice did n't change in volume or tone when he spoke again . " Dr. Court has been singled out . What I want does n't matter as much as what the killer wants . That 's why she 's goingto have people on her at home , in her office , and at the damn grocery store.  | " She should be in the safe house for the next two weeks . " " That 's been considered and rejected . " " Rejected ? " Ben pushed himself away from the door . " Who rejected it ? " " I did . " Tess folded her hands on her file , then sat very still . Ben barely glanced at her before he poured his rage on Harris . " Since when do we use civilians ? As long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeopardy . " " She 's being guarded . " " Yeah . And we all know how easily something can go wrong . One misstep ' and you 'll be tacking her picture up there . " " Ben . " Lowenstein reached out for his arm , but he shook her off . " We 've got no business taking chances with her when we know he 's going to go for her . She goes in the safe house . " " No . " Tess gripped her hands together so tight the knuckles whitened . " I ca n't treat my patients unless I go to my office and the clinic . " " You ca n't treat them if you 're dead either . " He spun to her , slamming both palms flat on the table . " So take a vacation . Buy yourself a ticket to Martinique or Cancun . I want you out of this . " " I ca n't , Ben . Even if I could walk away from my patients for a few weeks , I ca n't walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Harris amended in a quieter tone . " Dr. Court is aware of her options . As long as she 's here , she 'll be protected . It 's Dr. Court 's own opinion that he 'll seek her out . Since she 's decided to cooperate with the department , we 'll be able to keep her under tight surveillance and cut him off when he makes his move . " " We get her out , and we plant a policewoman in her place . " " No . " This time Tess rose , slowly . " I 'm not going to have someonedie in my place again . Not again . " " And I 'm not going to find you in some alley with a scarf around your neck . " He turned his back on her . " You 're using her because the investigation 's stalled , because we 've got one jerky witness , a religiousoutlet in Boston , and a ream of psychiatric guesswork . " " I 'm accepting Dr. Court 's cooperation because we 've got fourp206dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach that kept Harrisfrom raising his voice . ' And I need every one of my officers at top level . Pull yourself together , Ben , or you 'll be the one out of it . " Tess gathered up her papers and quietly slipped out . Ed was less than ten seconds behind her . " Want some air ? " he asked when he found her standing miserably in the hall . " Yes . Thanks . " He took her elbow in a way that would normally have made her smile . As he pushed open the door , the blast of November wind buffeted them . The sky was a hard , cold blue , without a cloud to soften it . Both of them remembered it had been August , hot steamy August , when it had begun . Ed waited while Tess buttoned her coat . " I think we might get some snow by Thanksgiving , " he said conversationally . " I suppose . " She dipped into her pocket and found her gloves , but only stood running them through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What ? " " The turkeys , " Ed repeated . " You know , Thanksgiving . I do n't guess they 're very grateful to be a tradition . " " No . " She found she could smile after all . " No , I guess not . " " He 's never been tangled up with a woman before . Not like this . Not like you . " Tess let out a long breath , wishing she could find the answer . She 'd always been able to find the answer . " It just gets more complicated . " " I 've known Ben a long time . " Ed pulled a peanut out of his pocket , cracked it , and offered the meat to Tess . When she shook her head , he popped it into his mouth . " He 's pretty easy to read , if you know how to look . Right now he 's scared . He 's scared of you and he 's scared for you . " Tess looked out over the parking lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came out and found his right-front tire flat . " I do n't know what to do . I ca n't run away from this , though part of me , deep down , is terrified . " " Of the phone calls or Ben ? "  | " I 'm beginning to think you should be in my business , " she murmured . " If you 're a cop long enough , you learn a little bit of everything . " " I 'm in love with him . " It came out slowly , like a test . Once it was said , she took a shaky breath . " That would be hard enough undernormal circumstances , but now . . . I ca n't do what he wants . " " He knows that . That 's why he 's scared . He 's a good cop . As long as he 's looking out for you , you 're going to be okay . " " I 'm counting on it . He 's got a problem with what I do for a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about that . You know why . " " Let 's say I know enough to say he 's got his reasons , and when he 's ready , he 'll let you know about them . " She studied his wide , wind-reddened face . " He 's lucky to have you . " " I 'm always telling him . " " Bend down a minute . " When he did , she brushed her lips over his cheek . " Thanks . " His color rose a little higher . " Do n't mention it . " Ben watched them through the glass door a moment before he pushed it open . He 'd used up most of his temper on Harris . All that was left was a dull ache in the center of his gut . He knew enough of fear to recognize it . " Moving in on my time ? " he asked mildly . " If you 're stupid enough to make room . " Ed smiled down at Tess and handed her some peanuts . " Take care of yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing as Ed disappeared inside . His jacket unzipped , Ben stood beside her , looking , as she did , out over the parking lot . The wind sent a small brown bag racing across the asphalt . " I 've got a neighbor who 'll look after my cat for a while . " When Tess remained silent , he shifted . " I want to move in with you . " She stared hard at the flat tire . " More police protection ? " " That 's right . " And more , a whole lot more . He wanted to be with her , day and night . He could n't explain , not yet , that he wanted to live with her , when he 'd never lived with another woman . Thatp208kind of commitment had been dangerously close to a permanency he did n't consider himself ready for . Tess studied the peanuts in her hand before slipping them into her pocket . As Ed had said , he was easy enough to read if you knew how to look . " I 'll give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How about dinner ? " " Now and then . " " Sounds reasonable . Tess ? " " Yes ? " " If I told you I wanted you to go because . . . " He hesitated , then put his hands on her shoulders . " Because I do n't think I could handle it if anything happened to you , would you go ? " " Would you come with me ? " " I ca n't . You know I have to  --  " He broke off , struggling with frustration as she looked up at him . " All right . I should know better than to argue with someone who plays Ping-Pong with brain cells . You 'll do what you 're told , though , right down the line . " " I have a vested interest in making this case easier for you , Ben . Until it 's over , I 'll do what I 'm told . " " That has to do . " He backed off just enough for her to realize it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood with her . " Two uniforms are following you to your office . We 've arranged for the guard in the lobby to take a vacation , and have already replaced him with one of ours . We 'll have three men taking turns in your waiting room . Whenever it can be arranged , I 'll pick you up and take you home . When it ca n't , the uniforms will follow you . We 're using an empty apartment on the third floor as a base , but when you get in , your door stays locked . If you have to go out for any reason , you call in and wait until it 's cleared . " " It sounds thorough . " He thought about the four glossies on the corkboard . " Yeah . If anything , I mean anything , happens  --  a guy cuts you off at a light , somebody stops you on the street for directions  --  I want to know about it . " " Ben , it 's no one 's fault that things have taken this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . We just have to see it through . "  | " That 's what I intend to do . There 're the uniforms . You 'd better get going . " " All right . " She went down the first step , then stopped and turned back . " I guess it would be improper conduct for you to kiss me here , while you 're on duty . " " Yeah . " He bent down , and in the way that never failed to make her limbs weak , cupped her face in his hands . Eyes open and on hers , he lowered his mouth . Her lips were chilled , but soft , generous . Her free hand gripped the front of his coat for balance , or to keep him there an extra moment . He watched in fascination as her lashes fluttered , then lowered slowly to shadow her cheeks . " Can you remember just where you were for about eight hours ? " Tess murmured . " I 'll make a point of it . " He drew away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We would n't want the uniforms to be tempted to give you a ticket . " " I 'd just have it fixed . " She smiled . " See you tonight . " He let her go . " I like my steak medium-well . " " I like mine rare . " He watched her get into her car then pull competently out of the lot . The uniforms stayed a car length behind . TESS KNEW SHE WAS dreaming , just as she knew there weresolid and logical reasons for the dream . But it did n't stop her from knowing fear . She was running . The muscles in her right calf were knotted with the effort . In sleep she whimpered quietly in pain . Corridors sprang up everywhere , confusing her . As much as she was able , she kept to a straight route , knowing there was a doorway somewhere . She had only to find it . In the maze her breathing bounced back heavily . The walls were mirrored now , and threw dozens of her reflectionsat her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupidly , but did n't set it aside . When it became too heavy for one hand , she dragged it with both and continued to run . As she lost her balance , shep210thrust out a hand and connected with a mirror . Panting , she looked up . Anne Reasoner stared back at her . Then the mirror melted away into another corridor . So she ran on , taking the straight path . The weight of the briefcasehurt her arms , but she pulled it with her . Muscles strained and burned . Then she saw the door . Almost sobbing with relief , she dragged herself to it . Locked . She looked desperately for the key . There was always a key . But the knob turned slowly from the other side . " Ben . " Weak with relief , she reached out a hand for him to help her over that final step to safety . But the figure was black and white . The black cassock , the white collar . The white silk of the amice . She saw it come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she started to scream . " Tess . Tess , come on , baby , wake up . " She was gasping , reaching up for her throat as she dragged herselfout of the dream . " Relax . " His voice came calm and soothing out of the dark . " Just breathe deep and relax . I 'm right here . " She clung hard , with her face pressed into Ben 's shoulder . As his hands moved up and down her back , she fought to focus on them and let the dream fade . " I 'm sorry , " she managed when she caught her breath . " It was just a dream . I 'm sorry . " " Must have been a beaut . " Gently , he brushed the hair from her face . Her skin was clammy . Ben pulled the covers up and wrapped them around her . " Want to tell me about it ? " " Just overwork . " She drew her knees up to rest her elbows on them . " Want some water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands over her face as she listened to the tap run in the bathroom . He left the light on so that it slanted through the door . " Here you go . You have nightmares often ? " " No . " She sipped to ease her dry throat . " I had some after myp211parents died . My grandfather would come in and sit with me , and fall asleep in the chair . " " Well , I 'll sit with you . " After he got into bed again , he put an arm around her . " Better ? " " A lot . I guess I feel stupid . " " Would n't you say , psychiatrically speaking , that under certain circumstances it 's healthy to be scared ? " " I suppose I would . " She let her head rest on his shoulder . " Thanks . " " What else is bothering you ? " She took a last sip of water before setting the glass aside . " I was making an effort not to let it show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tess sighed and stared at the slant of light on the bedroom floor . " I have a patient . Or I had one , anyway . This young boy , fourteen , alcoholic , severe depression , suicidal tendencies . I wanted his parents to put him into a clinic in Virginia . " " They wo n't go for it . " " Not only that , but he missed his session today . I called , got the mother . She tells me that she feels Joey 's progressing just fine . She did n't want to discuss the clinic , and she 's going to let him take a breather from his sessions . There 's nothing I can do . Nothing . " It was that , most of all , that had slapped her down . " She wo n't face the fact that he is n't progressing . She loves him , but she 's put blinders on so she does n't have to see anything that is n't in straight focus . I 've been slappinga Band-Aid on him every week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't make her bring the boy in . Maybe a breather will help . Let the wound get some air . " " I wish I could believe that . " It was the tone of her voice that made him shift , and bring her closer . When he 'd woken to her screams , his blood had run cold . Now it was pumping warm again . " Look , Doc , both of us are in the business where we can lose people . It 's the kind of thing that wakes you up at three in the morning , has you staring at walls or out windows . Sometimes you 've just got to turn it off . Just turn the switch . "  | " I know . Rule number one is professional detachment . " His hair brushed her cheek as she turned her face to his . " What turns the switch best for you ? " In the shadowed light she saw him grin . " You really want to know ? " " Yes . " She ran a hand down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Right now I especially want to know . " " This usually works . " In one easy move he rolled her on top of him . He felt the give of firm breasts pressing against him , smelled the fragrance of her hair as it curtained his face . He took a handful and brought her mouth down to his . How well she seemed to fit . The thought ran through his head . The brush of her fingertips on his skin was like a blessing . There was something about her hesitancy that had his own excitement drumming . If he ran his own fingers along her inner thigh , she shivered , just enough to let him know she wanted him but was still unsure . He did n't know why or how it should seem so fresh with her . Each time he found himself holding her in the dark , in the quiet , it was like the first time . She was bringing something to him he had n't known he 'd missed and was no longer certain he could do without . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to roll her over on her back , pump himself into her until they both exploded . With most women it had always been that last , split second of insanitythat had washed everything else away . With Tess it was a touch , a murmur , a quiet brush of lips . So he pushed back that first rage of desire and let them both drift . He could be so gentle , she thought hazily . At times when they made love , it was all speed , all urgency . And then . . . When she least expected it , he would be tender , almost lazy , until her heart was ready to break from the sweetness of it . Now he let her touch the body she had come to know as well as her own . There were sighs . Sighs of contentment . There were murmurs . Murmurs of promises . He buried his hands in her hair as she tasted , almost shyly at first , then with growing confidence . There were musclesto be discovered . She found them taut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p213There  were bones in his hips , long and narrow . When her tongue glided over them , he arched like a bow . The trail of her finger along the crease of his thigh had his long body shuddering . She sighed as her lips followed the path . There was no more thought of nightmares . He 'd had women touch him . Maybe too many women . But none of them had made his blood hammer like this . He wanted to lie there for hours and absorb each separate sensation . He wanted to make her sweat and shake as he was . He sat up , grabbing her hands at the wrist . For a moment , a long moment , they stared at each other in the narrow beam of light . His breath came in pants . His eyes were dark , glazed with passion . The scent of desire hung heavy in the room . He lowered her slowly , until she lay on her back . With his hands still gripping her wrists , he used his mouth to drive her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his hold . Her body twisted , arched , not in protest , but in a delirium of pleasure . His tongue slid over her , into her , until she thought her lungs would balloon and explode from the pressure . He felt her go rigid and call out as she came . Her scent spilled into the room . She was limp , boneless , when he filled her . " I 'm going to watch you go up again . " He braced himself over her , and though each muscle trembled with the effort , went slowly , exquisitely slowly . She moaned , then opened her eyes as the sensations and pleasure began to build again . Her lips trembled open as she started to say his name . Then her fingersdug into the rumpled sheets . Ben buried his face in her hair and cut himself loose.  |p214APPRECIATE  YOUR MAKING time to see me , Monsignor . " Tess took a seat in the front of Logan 's desk and had a quick , not entirelycomfortable flash of how her patients must feel during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was settled comfortably , his tweed jacket draped over the back of his chair , his shirtsleeves rolled up to revealsturdy forearms sprinkled with hair just beginning to gray . She thought again that he seemed to be a man more accustomed to the rugby field or racquetball court than vespers and incense . " Would you like some tea ? " " No . Nothing , thank you , Monsignor . " " Since we 're colleagues , why do n't you call me Tim ? " " Yes . " She smiled , ordering herself to relax , starting with her toes . " That would make things easier . My call to you today was on impulse , but  --  " " When a priest is troubled , he seeks out another priest . When an analyst is troubled . . . " As he trailed off , Tess found her consciouseffort to relax was working.  | " Exactly . " The fingers on her purse loosened their grip . " I guess that means you get hit from both ends . " " It also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have problems of my own . That 's a matter which has its pros and cons , but you did n't come to discuss Christ versus Freud . Why do n't you tell me what 's troubling you ? " " At this point , a number of things . I do n't feel like I 've found the key to the mind of . . . of the man the police are looking for . " " And you think you should have ? " " I think being as involved as I am now , I should have more . " She lifted one hand in a gesture that spoke of frustration and uncertainty . " I 've talked to him three times . It bothers me that I ca n't get through my own fear , maybe my own self-interest , to push the right buttons . " " Do you think you know those buttons ? " " It 's my job to know them . " " Tess , we both know the psychotic mind is a maze , and the routes leading to the core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him under intensive therapy in ideal conditions , it might take years to find the answers . " " Oh , I know . Logically , medically , I know that . " " But emotionally is a different story . " Emotionally . She dealt with other people 's emotions on a daily basis . It was different , and much more difficult , she discovered , to open her own to someone else . " I know it 's unprofessional , and that worries me , but I 'm past the point where I can be objective . MonsignorLogan  --  Tim  --  that last woman who was killed was meant to be me . I saw her in that alley . I ca n't forget . " His eyes were kind , but she saw no pity in them . " Transferring guilt wo n't change what happened . " " I know that too . " She rose and went to the window . Below , a group of students rushed across the grass to make their next class . " May I ask you a question ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Does it bother you that this man may be , or may have been , a priest ? "  | " On a personal level , you mean , because I 'm a priest ? " To consider it , he sat back with his hands steepled . As a young man he 'd boxed both in and out of the ring . His knuckles were fat and spread . " I ca n't deny a certain discomfort . Certainly the idea of the man being a priest rather than , say , a computer programmer , makes the entire business more sensational . But the simple truth is that priests are not saints , but as human as a plumber , a right fielder , or a psychiatrist . " " When he 's found , will you want to treat him ? " " If I were asked , " Logan said slowly . " If I believed I could be of use , then perhaps . I would n't feel obliged or responsible , as I believe you do . " " You know , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me to help him . " She turned to the window again . " I had a dream last night . A rather dreadful one . I was lost in these corridors , this maze , and I was running . Even though I knew I was dreaming I was still terrified . The walls became mirrors and I could see myself over and over again . " Unconsciously she put a hand to the glass of the window , as she had to the mirror in the dream . " I was carrying my briefcase , dragging it really , because it was so heavy . I looked in one of the mirrors and it was n't my reflection , but Anne Reasoner 's . Then she was gone and I was running again . There was a door . I just had to get on the other side of that door . When I got there , it was locked . I looked frantically for the key , but I did n't have it . Then the door opened on its own . I thought I was safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frock and the amice . " She turned back , but could n't bring herself to sit . " Oh , I could sit down and write a very detailed and comprehensive analysis of that dream . My fear of being out of control in this situation , overwork , and my refusal to cut down on that workload . Guilt over Anne Reasoner . My frustration at not finding the key to this case and my ultimate , my very ultimate failure . " She had n't mentioned fear for her life . Logan considered it a very interesting and telling omission . Either she had not yet brought herself to face it , or she linked the possibility with her dread of failing . " You 're so sure you 're going to fail ? " " Yes , and I detest the idea . " The admission brought a self/depreciating smile . Tess ran her fingers over the cover of the antiquebible and found the carving deep and smooth . " There 's something in here about pride going before a fall . " " I tend to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policeeverything a trained psychiatrist could , Tess . You have n't failed . " " I never have , you know . Not really . Not on a personal level . I did well in school , played hostess very properly for my grandfather until my practice cut back on my free time . As far as men were concerned , after one minor disaster in college I always made sure I called the shots . Things have been very safe and tidy until . . . well , until a few months ago . " " Tess , as far as this case is concerned , you were brought in as a consultant . It 's the police department 's responsibility to find this man . " " Maybe I could have left it at that . Maybe , " she murmured , running a hand through her hair . " I 'm not totally sure . But now , how can I ? He 's turned to me . When he spoke to me , there was a desperation , a plea . How could I , how could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treating him at some later date is n't the same thing as feeling responsible for the results of his illness . " A frown of concern entered his eyes as he linked his fingers and rested them on the desk . " If I had to speculate out of hand , before a thorough reading of this report , I would say he 's drawn to you because he senses compassion , and a certain vulnerability You have to be careful not to give so much of the first that you fall victim to the second . " " It 's difficult for me to follow the rules on this one . Ben  --  Detective Paris  --  wanted me to go out of town . When he suggested it , for a minute I thought , I 'll go . I 'll get on a plane and go down to , I do n't know , Mazatlan , and when I come back this will all be over and my life will be as neat and tidy as it used to be . " She paused and met Logan 's quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " Do n't you consider it a normal reaction to the stress of the situation ? " " For a patient , " she said , and smiled . " Not for me . " " There is such a thing as overachievement , Tess. "  | " I do n't smoke . I 'm a very light drinker . " She came back to sit . " I figure I 'm entitled to a vice . " " I do n't have sex , " Logan said contemplatively . " I suppose that 's why I feel entitled to smoke and drink . " He looked back , pleased that she seemed more at ease . Confession , he knew well , was good for the soul . " So you 're staying in Georgetown and cooperating with the police . How do you feel about that ? " " Nervous , " she told him immediately . " It 's an uneasy feeling to know someone 's watching you all the time . I do n't mean just  --  " Shaking her head , she broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call him . " " Most people would call him a killer . " " Yes , but he 's also a victim . In any case , it 's not just knowing he might be watching that unnerves me . It 's knowing the police are . At the same time I feel satisfied that it 's the right thing . I did n't cut and run . I want to help this man . It 's become very important to me to help him . In the dream , when I was faced with him I fell apart . Therefore I failed him and myself . I 'm not going to let that happen . " " No , I do n't think you will . " Logan picked up his letter opener , running the hilt through his hands . It was old and a bit tacky , a souvenirfrom a trip to Ireland during his youth . He was fond of it , as he was of many foolish things . Though he did n't consider Tess foolish , he was becoming fond of her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take offense if I suggest that after all this is over , you do get away for a while . Stress and overwork can break even the strongest of us . " " I wo n't take offense , but I might take it as doctor 's orders . " " Good girl . Tell me , how is Ben ? " When she gave him a blank stare , he smiled . " Oh , come , even a priest can smell romance in the air . " " I suppose you could say Ben is another problem . " " Romance is supposed to be a problem . " He put the letter opener down . " Are you calling the shots this time , Tess ? " " It does n't seem as though either of us is . We 're just fumbling around . He  --  I think we care for each other a great deal . We just have n't gotten around to trusting each other yet . " " Trust takes time if it 's going to be solid . I 've had a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a little bar downtown . " " Oh , really ? He did n't mention it . " " My dear , a man does n't like to mention he got drunk with a priest . In any case , would you like my opinion of Detective Paris ? " " Yes , I think I would . " " I 'd say he 's a very good man , dependable . The kind of man who probably calls his mother once a month even when he 'd rather not . Men like Ben bend rules but very rarely break them , because they appreciate structure , they understand the concept of law . There 's an anger in him he keeps well buried . He did n't give up the Church because of laziness , but because he found too many flaws . He gave up the Church , Tess , my dear , but he 's Catholic right down to his toes . " Tim sat back , pleased with himself . " Sixty-second analysis is my speciality . " " I believe it . " She pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have as much luck with this . I cleared it with Captain Harris . This is my updated report . You 'll also find the transcripts of my phone calls . I 'd appreciate a miracle . " " I 'll see what I can do . " " Thanks for listening . " " Any time . " He rose to go to the door with her . " Tess , if you have any more nightmares , give me a call . It never hurts to ask for a little help . " " Where have I heard that before ? " Logan watched her go through the outer office before he closed the door . HE WATCHED HER EXIT the building . It was dangerous to follow her , but he knew the time for caution was almost over . She paused by her car , looking for her keys . Her head was bent , as if in prayer . The need billowed up inside him until his head rang . Groping , he found the white silk in his coat pocket . Cool , soft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he was quick enough , sure enough , it could be over in minutes.  |p220His  fingers clutched and unclutched on the amice while his heart thudded in his throat . A few forgotten leaves , dry as dust , rustled around her ankles . He saw the wind blow wisps of hair around her face . She looked troubled . Soon , very soon , she would be at peace . They would all be at peace . He watched her get into her car , heard the door close , then the sound of the engine . A puff of smoke spurted out of the tailpipe . The car made a gentle sweep of the parking area , then turned onto the road . He waited until the police car made the turn before he went to his own car . She would go to her office now , and he would continue the vigil . The moment had n't arrived . There was still time to pray for her . And himself . UP S S HUNG UP THE phone , leaned back in her chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In her game , that was n't nearly good enough . Joey Higgins . How could she treat the boy if she could n't talk to him ? His mother had taken a stand . Joey was no longer drinking , therefore , Joey was fine and no longer needed the embarrassment of a psychiatrist . It had been a painful and ultimately fruitless conversation . She had one more shot . She had to make it good . Leaning forward , Tess buzzed her secretary . " Kate , how much time do I have before the next appointment ? " " Ten minutes . " " All right . Please get Donald Monroe on the line for me . " " Right away . " While she waited , Tess looked over Joey 's file . Their last session remained very clear in her mind . " Dying 's not such a big deal . " " Why do you say that , Joey ? " " ' Cause it 's not . People are always dying . You 're supposed to . " " Death 's inevitable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old people , very sick people , cling to life because it 's precious . " " People say when someone dies , they 're at peace . "  | " Yes , and most of us believe there is something after life . But each of us is here for a reason . Our life is a gift , not always easy , certainly not always perfect . Making it better for ourselves and for the people around us takes some effort . What 's your favorite thing to eat ? " He gave her a blank look . " Spaghetti , I guess . " " Meat balls or meat sauce ? " The smile was quick , but it was there . " Meat balls . " " Suppose you 'd never tasted spaghetti and meat balls . The sky would probably still be blue , Christmas would still come once a year , but you 'd be missing something pretty terrific . And if you were n't here , say you 'd never been born , we 'd still have the sky and Christmas , but something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back to the present . " Mr. Monroe on one . " Thank you , Kate . Mr. Monroe . " " Dr. Court . Is there a problem ? " " Yes , Mr. Monroe , I feel there 's a big problem . I 'm strongly opposedto Joey withdrawing from treatment . " " Withdrawing ? What do you mean ? " " Mr. Monroe , are you aware that Joey missed his last session ? " There was a pause before she caught just a whisper of a weary sigh . " No . I suppose he decided to take off on his own . I 'll discuss it with Lois . " " Mr. Monroe , I 've already spoken to your wife . She 's decided to take Joey out of therapy . I take it you were n't informed . " " No , I was n't . " Another pause , then he drew a long breath . " Dr. Court , Lois wants Joey to resume a normal life , and he does seem a great deal better . We told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to help me paint the nursery . " " I 'm glad to hear that , Mr. Monroe . My feeling is , however , that he 's far from ready to pull out of therapy . In fact , I still believe he would be helped a great deal by some time in the clinic we discussed . " " Lois is completely opposed to the clinic . I 'm sorry , Dr. Court , and I do appreciate your concern , but I have to back her on this . " Anger surged , barely controlled . Could n't he see it was the boy he had to back up ? That they both had to back up ? " I understandp222that you feel you should show Joey a united front . But , Mr. Monroe , I ca n't stress enough how vital it is for Joey to continue to receiveconsistent professional help . " " And , Dr. Court , there 's also the risk of overanalyzing . Joey is n't drinking , he is n't hanging around with the same crowd he was when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father in two weeks . " The last statement had alarm bells ringing in her head . " The fact that he has n't mentioned his father only means he 's repressing his feelings . His emotional state at this point is very tenuous . Can you understand , when there is little self-esteem , suicide becomes almosteasy ? I 'm afraid  --  no , I 'm terrified of what he might do . " " Dr. Court , I ca n't help but think you 're overreacting . " " I promise you , I 'm not . Mr. Monroe , I do n't want to see Joey become a statistic . What I want , more than anything , is for his therapyto stop , when he 's ready . It 's both my professional opinion and my gut instinct that he 's not . " " I 'll see if I can convince Lois to bring him back for another session . " But even as he said it , Tess recognized the dismissal . Some other boy might slash his wrists or swallow a bottle of pills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone asked Joey if he wants to continue seeing me ? " " Dr. Court , I can only promise to look into this . " Impatience came through now , with a trace of annoyance . " I 'll use whatever influenceI have to see that Joey comes back for at least one more session . I think you 'll see for yourself how much better he is . You 've been very helpful , Doctor , but if we feel Joey is well , then the sessions should be stopped . " " Please , before you do anything , would you get a second opinion ? Perhaps you 're right not to take my word for it . I can recommendseveral excellent psychiatrists in the area . " " I 'll talk to Lois . We 'll consider it . Thank you , Dr. Court , I know you 've helped Joey a great deal . " Not enough , she thought as the connection broke . Not nearly enough . " Dr. Court . Mr. Grossman is here . "  | " All right , Kate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but did n't put it away . Instead she set it aside on her desk , within easy reach . JT WAS NEARLY FIVE when the last patient left for the day . Kate stuck her head in the door . " Dr. Court , Mr. Scott did n't schedulehis next appointment . " " He does n't need one . " " Really ? " Kate relaxed against the door . " You did good work there , Dr. Court . " " I like to think so . You can take his file out of current patients . " " It 's a pleasure . " " Do it tomorrow , Kate . If you hurry you can get out of here exactlyone minute early . " " Watch me . Good night , Dr. Court . " " Good night , Kate . " When the phone rang she reached for it herself " I 've got it . Go on home , Kate . " With her hand on the receiver , she took a long breath . " Dr. Court . " " Hi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension dissolved . She heard background noises of phones , voices , and typewriters . " Still at work ? " " Yeah . I wanted you to know I 'd be a while yet . " " You sound tired . Did something happen ? " He thought of the day he 'd put in and the stench he was n't sure would ever wash off his skin . " It 's been a long one . Look , why do n't I pick up some pizza or something ? Things should be wrapped up here in another hour or so . " " Okay . Ben , I 'm a good listener . " " I 'll keep that in mind . Go straight home and lock the door . " " Yes , sir . " " See you later , smartass . " It was n't until she hung up that Tess realized how quiet the office was . Normally she would have appreciated an hour in the evening to herself . Her desk could be put in order , paperwork could be finished up . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself a fool , she picked up the Scott file to close it out . Success was satisfying.  |p224She  took the files and tapes from her late-afternoon patients and locked them away . Joey Higgins 's file remained on her desk . Knowing she was spinning her wheels , Tess put it in her briefcase to take home . Three times she caught herself looking toward her door with her pulse throbbing . Ridiculous . Determined not to be a fool , she checked the next day 's appointments . There were two policemen outside , she reminded herself , and one in the lobby . She was perfectly safe . But each time she heard the elevator hum in the hall outside , she felt a jolt . If she went home now , the apartment would be empty . She did n't want to face solitude there now , not now that she was sharing the apartment with Ben . What was she getting into ? Sighing , she began to gather the rest of her things . She was over her head with Ben Paris . Just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Very poorly , she decided as she went to the closet for her coat . If it were spring , she 'd have an excuse for daydreaming and smiling at nothing in particular . Smart people fell in love in spring , she thought , when everything was fresh and seemed as though it would stay that way . She stopped at the window . The trees that marched along the street in front of the buildings were dark and naked . What patches of grass could be seen were already yellowed and tired . People huddledinside their coats , heads bowed against the wind . It was n't spring , she thought , feeling foolish . And everyone 's hurrying home . Then she saw him . He stood very still in his black coat , just in back of a group of young trees . Her breath caught . Her knees trembled . Watching  --  he was waiting and watching . Instinctively , she swung around for the phone , grabbing it from her desk . She 'd call downstairs , she thought as she began to punch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was outside , watching . Then she 'd go down too . She 'd go because she 'd promised herself that much . But when she turned back to look , he was gone . She stood there a moment , the phone in her hand , the number half dialed . He was gone.  |p225Just  someone on his way home , Tess told herself . A doctor or lawyer or bank executive walking home to keep fit . She forced herself to walk back to her desk and calmly replace the phone . She was jumping at shadows . Because her legs were still unsteady , she sat on the edge of the desk . Layer by layer she rebuilt control . Diagnosis , acute paranoia . Prescription , hot bath and quiet evening with Ben Paris . Feeling better , she drew on her cashmere coat , hefted her briefcase , and tossed her purse strap over her shoulder . After locking her office , she turned and saw the knob on the reception-area door turn . The keys in her hand slipped out of nerveless fingers . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked . The door opened an inch . The scream backed up in her throat , bubbling hot . Frozen , she stared as the door opened a bit more . There was no maze to run through , no place to go . She took a deep breath , knowing she was on her own . " Anybody home ? " " Oh , Jesus , Frank . " Her knees felt like butter as she braced herselfagainst her office door . " What are you doing sneaking around the halls ? " " I was walking down to the elevator and saw the light under your door . " He smiled , delighted to find her alone . " Do n't tell me you 're taking work home again , Tess . " He stepped inside , strategicallyclosing the outer door at his back . " No , I keep my laundry in here . " She bent to retrieve her keys , furious enough with herself to let him feel the backlash . " Look , Frank , I 've had a long day . I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why , Tess . " His eyes widened , and so did his smile . " I had no idea you could be so . . . so aggressive . " " If you do n't get out of my way , you 're going to get a close-up view of the nap of this carpet . " " How about a drink ? " " Oh , for God 's sake . " She pushed past him , took hold of the freshly pressed sleeve of his jacket , and yanked him into the hall . " Dinner at my place ? "  |p226Setting  her teeth , Tess switched off the light , closed the door , and locked it . " Frank , why do n't you take your sexual delusions and write a book ? It might keep you out of trouble . " She whipped past him and punched the button for the elevator . " You could be chapter one . " She took a long breath , counted backward from ten , and discovered , to her amazement , that it did nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped inside , turned , and blocked the opening . " If you like the shape of your nose , Frank , do n't try to get on this elevator with me . " " How about dinner and a hot tub ? " he said as the doors started to close . " I know a great place for Chicken Kiev . " " Stuff it , " she muttered , then leaned against the back wall . She was nearly home before she started to laugh . It was possible , if she put her mind to it , to forget about the police car behind her , to block out the fact that on the third floor of her building cops were drinking coffee and watching the early news . A two-car accidenton Twenty-third held her up an extra fifteen minutes but did n't spoil the mood she was building . She was humming when she unlocked the door to her apartment . After wishing briefly that she 'd thought to pick up fresh flowers , she went straight to the bedroom and stripped . She chose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubble bath underthe stream of water pulsing into the tub . She took the time to put an album on the stereo . Phil Collins bounced out , happy to be alive and in love . So was she , Tess thought as she lowered herself into the steamingwater . And tonight she was going to enjoy every minute of it . When Ben used his key to get in , he felt he was home . The furniture was n't his , and he had n't picked out the paintings , but he was home . The cardboard box was warm on the bottom , where he held it . He set it on the dining room table , on top of the linen placement he imagined had taken some little French nun the better part of a week to embroider , and wished he could crawl into bed and sleep around the clock . He put the paper bag he carried next to the pizza before hep227stripped out of his coat and let it fall over the back of a chair . Peelingoff his shoulder holster , he dropped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , barely three steps inside the door , he could smell her . Soft , subtle , elegant . Drawing her in , he found fatigue warring against a need he 'd yet to find a way to curb . " Tess ? " " Back here . I 'm in the tub . I 'll be out in a minute . " He followed her scent and the sound of water . " Hi . " When she glanced up at him , he believed he saw her color rise a bit . Funny lady , he thought as he moved over to sit on the edge of the tub . She could make a man pant in bed , but she blushed when he caught her in a bubble bath . " I did n't know how long you 'd be . " She stopped herself from sinking farther under the cover of bubbles . " Just had to tie up a few things . " Embarrassment faded as quickly as it had come . " It was a rough one , was n't it ? You look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the less pleasant days on the job . " " Want to talk about it ? " He thought of the blood . Even in his business you did n't often see that much . " No , not now . " She sat up to reach over and touch his face . " There 's room in here for two , if you 're friendly . Why do n't you take Dr. Court 's reliableprescription for overwork ? " " The pizza 'll get cold . " " I love cold pizza . " She began to unbutton his shirt . " You know , I had a rather strange day myself , ending with an invitation for Chicken Kiev and a hot tub . " " Oh ? " He rose to unsnap his pants . The feeling that went through him was ugly , and unrecognizable to a man who 'd never experiencedbasic jealousy before . " Does n't seem too smart to turn that down for cold pizza and bubbles . " " More fool me for refusing an evening with the handsome , successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your type , " Ben muttered , sitting on the john to pull off his shoes.  | " Boring 's more my type ? " Tess lifted a brow as she leaned back . " Thank you very much . " " I mean the doctor , the three-piece suits , the Gold American Express Card . " " I see . " Amused , she began to soap her leg . " You do n't have a gold card ? " " I 'm lucky Sears still lets me charge my underwear . " " Well , in that case , I do n't know if I should invite you into my tub . " He stood , naked but for the jeans riding low at his hips . " I 'm serious , Tess . " " I can see that . " She took a handful of bubbles and studied them . " I guess that means you see me as a shallow , materialistic , statusmindedwoman who 's willing to slum it occasionally for good sex . " " I do n't mean anything like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tub again . " Look , I 've got a job that means I deal with slime almost on a daily basis . " Her hand was wet and very gentle when she set it on his . " It was a filthy day , was n't it ? " " That has nothing to do with it . " He took her hand in his a moment , studying it . It was rather small and narrow , delicate at the wrist . " My father sold used cars in a dealership that was barely on the right side of the tracks in the suburbs . He owned three sport coats and drove a DeSoto . My mother baked cookies . If a cookie could be baked , she did it . Their idea of a night on the town was the Knights of Columbus hall . I punched my way through high school , crammed my way through college for a couple of years then the Academy , and I 've spent the rest of my life looking at dead bodies . " " Are you trying to convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cultural , educational , and genealogical differences ? " " Do n't start that shit with me . " " All right . Let 's try another approach . " She pulled him into the tub . " What the hell are you doing ? " He spit out bubbles . " I 'm still dressed . " " I ca n't help it if you 're slow . " Before he could regain his bal/ance , she slid her arms around him and closed her mouth over his . Often , even a psychiatrist knows it 's action rather than words that gets to the core . She felt the tension ebb and flow before he reached for her . " Ben ? " " Hmm ? " " Do you think it 's relevant , at the moment , that your father sold used cars and mine did n't ? " No . " Good . " She drew back , and laughing , brushed bubbles from his chin . " Now , how are we going to manage to get your pants off ? " THE PIZZA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumb . Ben waited until she 'd dumped the carton . " I bought you a present . " " You did ? " Surprised , and foolishly pleased , she looked at the paper bag he offered . " Why ? " " Questions , always questions . " Then he drew it back as she reached for it . " You really want to know ? " " Yes . " He moved closer , close enough to slip an arm around her waist . The scent of the bath was on both of them . Her hair was pinned up and damp . " Well , I think I 'm going out of my head . Yes , I think I 'm going out of my head , over you . " She let her eyes close slowly for the kiss . " Little Anthony , " shemurmured , playing the tune over in her head . " Was it 1961 , ' 62 ? " " I figured you being a shrink , you 'd fall for that approach . " " You 're right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Umm-hmm . But I think you have to let me go so I can open the bag . " " Then do n't take too long . " He gave it to her , watching her expression as she looked inside . It could n't have been better  --  the blank frown , the surprise , then the amusement . " A dead bolt . God , Ben , you know how to sweep a woman off her feet . "  | " Yeah , it 's a real talent . " Her lips curved as she pressed them against his . " I 'll always treasure it . If it was a little less bulky , I 'd wear it next to my heart . " " It 's going to be in your door in less than an hour . I put my tools in the kitchen closet the other day . " " Handy too . " " Why do n't you see if there 's something you can do for a while . Otherwise , I 'll make you watch . " " I 'll come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . While he worked , Tess edited a lecture she was to give at George Washington University the following month . The buzz of the drill and clank of metal against wood did n't disturb her . She began to wonder how she had ever tolerated the total silence of her life before him . When her lecture was in order and the files she 'd brought home dealt with , she turned to see him just finishing up . The lock looked bright and secure . " That should do it . " " My hero . " He shut the door , held up a pair of keys , then set them on the table . " Just use it . I 'll put my tools away and wash up . You can sweep the floor . " " Sounds fair . " As she walked toward the door , she paused to turn on the television for the news . Though there seemed to be more mess than the small lock warranted , Tess swept the sawdust into the pan without complaint . She was straightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the top story came on . " Police discovered the bodies of three people in an apartment in North West . Responding to the concern of a neighbor , police broke into the apartment late this afternoon . The victims had been stabbed repeatedly while bound with clothesline . Identified were Jonas Leery , Kathleen Leery , his wife , and Paulette Leery , their teenaged daughter . Robbery is thought to be the motive . We 'll switch to Bob Burroughs on the scene for more details . " A husky , athletic-looking reporter appeared on the screen , holding a microphone and gesturing at the brick building behind him.  |p231Tess  turned and saw Ben just outside the kitchen doorway . She knew immediately that he 'd seen the inside of the building himself . " Oh , Ben , it must have been dreadful . " " They 'd been dead ten , maybe twelve hours . The kid could n't have been more than sixteen . " The memory of it had the acid burning in his stomach . " They 'd carved her up like a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She set everything aside and went to him . " Let 's sit down . " " You get to a point , " he said , still watching the screen , " you get to a point where it 's almost , almost routine . Then you walk into something like that apartment today . You walk in and your stomach turns over . You think , God , it 's not real . It ca n't be real because peopleca n't do that kind of thing to each other . But you know , deep down , you know they can . " " Sit down , Ben , " she murmured , easing them both onto the couch . " Do you want me to turn it off ? " " No . " But he rested his head in his hands for a minute , then dragged them through his hair before he straightened . The on-thescenereporter was talking to a weeping neighbor . " Paulette used to baby-sit my little boy . She was a sweet girl . I ca n't believe this . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down , " Ben said half to himself . " There was a coin collection . A fucking coin collection worth eight hundred , maybe a thousand . Fenced , it might bring half that . They butchered those people for a bunch of old coins . " She glanced back at the lock , now firmly in her door , and understood why he 'd brought it to her tonight . She drew him close , and in the way women have of offering comfort , rested his head against her breast . " They 'll pawn the coins , then you 'll trace them . " " We 've got a couple other leads . We 'll have them tomorrow , the day after at the latest . But those people , Tess . . . sweet Christ , as long as I 've been in this , I still ca n't believe anything human could do that . " " I ca n't tell you not to think about it , but I can tell you I 'm here for you . "  |p232Knowing  it , knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . She was there for him , and for tonight , for a few hours , he could make that all that mattered . " I need you . " He shifted , bringing her over into his lap so that he could nuzzle at her throat . " It scares the hell out of me . " " I know . "  |p233TESS  , I DO N'T KNOW . I 'm not at my best with senators . " Ben sent Lowenstein a snarl as she grinned over at him , then turned his back , cradling the phone between shoulder and jaw . " He 's my grandfather , Ben , and really rather sweet . " " I 've never heard anyone call Senator Jonathan Writemore a sweetheart . " Pilomento called him from across the room , so Ben nodded and gestured with a finger to hold him off . " That 's because I 'm not doing his P.R . In any case , it 's Thanksgiving , and I do n't want to disappoint him . And you did tell me your parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Parents are supposed to move to Florida when they hit sixty-five . " " So you do n't have any family to have Thanksgiving dinner with . I 'm sure Grandpa would like to meet you . " " Yeah . " He tugged at the neck of his sweater . " Look , I 've always had this policy about going to meet family . " " Which is ? " " I do n't do it . "  | " Oh ? Why is that ? " " Questions , " he muttered under his breath . " When I wasyounger my mother always wanted me to bring the girl I was seeinghome . Then my mother and the girl would get ideas . " " I see . " He could hear the smile in her voice . " Anyway , I made a policy  --  I do n't take women to see my mother , and I do n't go to see theirs . That way nobody gets the idea to start picking out silver patterns . " " I 'm sure you have a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss silver patterns if you join us for dinner . Miss Bette makes a terrific pumpkin pie . " " Fresh ? " " Absolutely . " A smart woman knew when to back off . " You 've got some time to think about it . I would n't have bothered you with it now , but with everything that 's been going on , I 'd forgotten the whole thing myself until Grandpa called a few minutes ago . " " Yeah , I 'll give it some thought . " " And do n't worry . If you decide against it , I 'll still bring you a piece of pie . I 've got a patient waiting . " " Tess  --  " " Yes ? " " Nothing . Nothing , " he repeated . " See you later . " " Paris . " " Sorry . " He hung up the phone and turned . " What you got ? " Pilomento handed him a sheet of paper . " We finally tracked down that name the neighbor gave us . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Right . Amos Reeder . Not much of a description because the neighbor only saw him come by once . Creepy looking was about the upshot , but she admitted she only saw him go to the Leerys ' once , and there was n't any trouble . " Ben was already picking up his jacket . " We always check out creepy looking . " " I got an address and rap sheet . " Before he stuffed his pack of cigarettes into his pocket , hep235noted with some disgust that he only had two left . " What 'd he do time for ? " " When he was seventeen he carved another kid up for pocket money . Reeder had a nickle bag of pot in his pocket and a line of needle marks on his arm . Other kid pulled through , Reeder was tried as a minor , got drug rehab . Harris said you and Jackson should have a talk with him . " " Thanks . " Taking the papers , he headed to the conference room , where Ed had his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , " Ben said briefly , and started toward the door . Ed lumbered beside him , already bundling into his coat . " What 's up ? " " Got a lead on the Leery case . Young punk who likes knives was hanging around the girl . Thought we might chat awhile . " " Sounds good . " Ed settled comfortably in the car . " How about Tammy Wynette ? " " Kiss ass . " Ben punched in a cassette of Goat 's Head Soup . " Tess called a few minutes ago . " Ed opened one eye . He considered it best to handle the Rolling Stones blind . " Problem ? " " No . Well , yeah , I guess . She wants me to have Thanksgiving dinner with her grandfather . " " Whoa , turkey with Senator Writemore . Think he needs a caucusto decide whether it 's going to be oyster or chestnut dressing ? " " I knew I was going to get grief on this . " More for spite thanout of desire , Ben pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got it out of my system . So you 're going to have Thanksgiving dinner with Tess and her granddaddy . What 's the problem ? " " First it 's Thanksgiving , then before you know it , it 's Sunday brunch . Then Aunt Mabel 's coming over to check you out . " Ed dug in his pocket , decided to save the yogurt-covered raisins for later , and settled for sugarless gum . " Does Tess have an Aunt Mabel ? " " Try to follow the trend here , Ed . " He downshifted and broughtp236the car to a halt at a stop sign . " You turn around twice and you 're invited to her cousin Laurie 's wedding and her Uncle Joe is punchingyou in the ribs with his elbow and asking when you 're going to take the plunge . " " All that because of mashed potatoes and gravy . " Ed shook his head . " Amazing . " " I 've seen it happen . I tell you , it 's scary . " " Ben , you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Mabel . Scarier things . " " Oh , yeah , like what ? " " Do you know how much undigested red meat is clogging up your intestines ? " " Jesus , that 's disgusting . " " You 're telling me . My point here , Ben , is that you can worry about nuclear waste , acid rain , and your own cholesterol intake . Keep these things in the front of your mind and join the senator for dinner . If he starts looking like he 's ready to welcome you into the family , do something to throw him off . " " Such as ? " " Eat your cranberry sauce with your fingers . Here 's the place . " Ben pulled up at the curb then tossed his cigarette through thecrack of his window . " You 've been a big help , Ed . Thanks . " " Any time . How do you want to handle this ? " From the car Ben studied the building . It had seen better days . Much better days . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Graffiti was splashed lavishly on the east wall . Cans and broken bottles were in more profusion than grass . " He 's in 303 . Fire escape 's on the third floor . If he bolts , I do n't want to chase him all over his own territory . " Ed dug a dime out of his pocket . " We flip to see who goes in and who covers the back . " " Fine . Heads I go in , tails I climb up the fire escape and cover the window . Oh , no , not in here . " Ben put a hand on Ed 's arm before his partner could flip the coin . " Last time you flipped in here I ended up having bean sprouts for lunch . We do it outside , where we 've got some room.  |p237In  agreement , they got out and stood on the sidewalk . Ed took off his gloves , pocketing them before he flipped the coin . " Heads , " he announced , showing the coin . " Give me time to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben kicked the glass neck of a beer bottle out of his way and started into the building . Inside it smelled like baby puke and old whiskey . Ben unzipped his jacket as he climbed to the third floor . He took a long , slow look up and down the hall before he knocked on 303 . The door was opened a crack by a teenager with matted hair and a missing front tooth . Even before he got the first whiff of pot , Ben saw by his eyes that he was high . " Amos Reeder ? " " Who wants him ? " Ben flipped open his badge . " Amos ai n't here . He 's out looking for work . " " Okay . I 'll talk to you . " " Man , you got a warrant or something ? " " We can talk in the hall , inside , or downtown . You got a name ? " " I do n't have to tell you nothing . I 'm in here minding my own business . " " Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show probable cause . Want me to come in and take a look around ? Vice is having a special this week . For every ounce of pot I turn in , I get a free T-shirt . " " Kevin Danneville . " Ben saw sweat begin to pearl on the kid'sforehead . " Look , I got rights . I do n't have to talk to no cops . " " You look nervous , Kevin . " Ben pressed a hand to the door tokeep the crack open . " How old are you ? " " I 'm eighteen , if it 's any of your fucking business . " " Eighteen ? You look more like sixteen to me , and you 're not in school . I might have to take you down to juvie . Why do n't you tell me about a little girl whose daddy had a coin collection ? " It was the shifting of Kevin 's eyes that saved Ben 's life . He saw the change of expression , and on instinct whirled . The knife came down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slice through his arm as he fell against the door and crashed into the apartment.  | " Christ , Amos , he 's a cop . You ca n't kill a cop . " Kevin , rushing to get out of the way , crashed into a table and sent a lamp shattering to the floor . Reeder , flying on the PCP he 'd just scored , only grinned . " I 'm going to cut the motherfucker 's heart out . " Ben had time enough to see that his assailant was barely old enough to be out of high school before the knife swung toward him again . He dodged , fighting to free his weapon with his left hand as blood poured out of the right . Kevin scooted over the floor like a crab and whimpered . Behind them the window crashed in . " Police . " Ed stood outside the window , legs spread , revolver level . " Drop the knife or I 'll shoot . " Spittle ran out of the side of Amos 's mouth as he focused on Ben . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Slice you into littlepieces , man . " Hefting the knife over his head , he made a leap . The .38 caliber , blunt-nosed wadcutter caught him in the chest and jerked his body back . For a moment he stood , eyes wide , blood pumping out of the hole in his chest . Ed kept his finger wrapped around the trigger guard . Then Reeder went down , taking a folding table with him . The knife slipped out of his hand with a quiet clatter . He died without a sound . Ben stumbled and went down to his knees . By the time Ed climbed through the broken window , he 'd managed to free his gun . " Flinch , " Ben said between gritted teeth as he aimed his service revolverat Kevin . " Just one good flinch is considered resisting arrest . " " Amos did it . Amos did all of them , " Kevin said as he began to blubber . " I just watched . I swear , I just watched , that 's all . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll blow your balls off before you learn how to use them . " Ed made a routine and unnecessary check of Amos before he crouched beside Ben . " How bad 's the arm ? " The pain was incredibly hot and had already made a trip into his stomach to trigger nausea . " I had to pick heads . Next time I toss . " " Fine . Let 's have a look . " " Just call someone in to clean up this mess , and get me to the hospital . "  | " Did n't hit an artery or you 'd be gushing out A Positive . " " Oh , that 's okay then . " He sucked in his breath as Ed revealed the wound . " How about a round of golf ? " " Just keep this on it , hold the pressure steady . " Ed took Ben 's gun then clamped his hand onto the bandanna he 'd put on the gash . The smell of his own blood drifted up to him . ' Where he sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thanks . " " It 's okay , it 's an old bandanna . " " Ed . " Ben spared a glance at Kevin , who 'd curled into the fetal position with his hands over his ears . " He 's got a picture of Charles Manson over the bed . " " I saw it . " BEN SAT ON THE edge of the table in Emergency and counted nurses to keep his mind off the needle going in and out of his flesh . The doctor who stitched him up chatted amiably about the Redskins ' chances against the Cowboys on Sunday . In the curtained enclosure beside them a doctor and two nurses worked on a nineteen-year-old girl fighting off a crack overdose . Ben listened to her sobbing and wished for a cigarette . " I hate hospitals , " he muttered . " Most people do . " The doctor sewed as neatly as a maiden aunt . " The defensive line 's like a brick wall . If we keep it on the ground , Dallas is going to be standing around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a pretty sight . " Ben 's concentration wavered long enough for him to feel the pull and tug on his flesh . He focused his attention on the sounds behind the curtain . The kid was hyperventilating . A sharp , authoritative voice was ordering her to breathe into a paper bag . " You get many like her in here ? " " More every day . " The doctor knotted off another suture . " We put them back on their feet , if they 're lucky , so they can go to the first street corner and buy another vial . There , that 's a very nice seam , if I say so myself . What do you think ? " " I 'll take your word for it . "  |p240Tess  rushed through the automatic glass doors of Emergency . After a quick glance around the waiting area , she headed toward the examining rooms . She stopped , staring blankly as an orderly wheeled away a gurney with a shrouded figure on top . Her blood drained down to her feet . A nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arm . " I 'm sorry , miss , you do n't belong back here . " " Detective Paris . Stabbing . " " He 's getting his arm stitched up back there . " The nurse kept her grip firm . " Now , why do n't you go back to the waiting room and  --  " " I 'm his doctor , " Tess managed , and tore her arm away . She did n't run . There was enough control left so that she walked steadily enough past a broken arm , a second-degree burn , and a mild concussion . An old woman lay on a gurney in the hall , trying miserably to sleep . Tess passed the last curtained area and found him . " Why , Tess . " The doctor looked over , pleased and surprised . " What are you doing here ? " " Oh . John . Hello . " " Hello yourself . It 's not often I get beautiful women to visit me at the office , " he began , then saw the way she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His considerable ego took only a slight bruise . " I take it you two know each other . " Ben shifted on the table and would have stood if the doctor had n't held him still . " What are you doing in here ? " " Ed called me at the clinic . " " He should n't have . " Now that her images of him bleeding to death were put to rest , her knees went weak . " He thought I might be concerned , and did n't want me to hear about it on a news bulletin . John , how bad is it ? " " It 's no big deal , " Ben answered . " Ten stitches , " the doctor added as he secured the bandage . " No apparent muscle damage , some blood loss but nothing major . To quote the Duke , it 's just a scratch . " " The guy had a goddamn butcher knife , " Ben muttered , annoyedat having someone else downplay his injury.  | " Fortunately , " John went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the detective 's jacket and fancy footwork prevented the wound from being any deeper . Without it , we 'd have been stitching up both sides of his arm . This will sting a bit . " " What will ? " Automatically Ben shot out a hand to grab the doctor 's wrist . " Just a little tetanus shot , " John said soothingly . ' After all , we do n't know where that knife has been . Come on now , bite the bullet . " He started to protest again , but Tess took his hand . The sting in his arm came , then dulled . " There now . " John left the tray for a nurse to deal with . " That ties things up . Forgive the pun . No tennis or sumo wrestling for a couple of weeks , Detective . Keep the area dry and come back for a returnvisit the end of next week . I 'll yank those stitches out for you . " " Thanks a lot . " " Your good health and medical insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give me a call the next time you 're in the mood for saki and sea urchin . " " Bye , John . " " John , huh ? " Ben eased himself off the table . " Did you ever date anyone but doctors ? " " Whatever for ? " A light answer seemed best when she 'd spottedthe blood-soaked linen on the tray . " Here 's your shirt . Let me help you . " " I can do it . " But his arm was stiff and painful . He managed one sleeve . " It 's all right . You 're entitled to be cranky after ten stitches . " " Cranky ? " He shut his eyes as she eased his shirt on . " Jesus Christ . Four-year-olds are cranky if they do n't have a nap . " " Yes , I know . Here , I 'll button it . " She intended to . She told herselfshe would button his shirt , keep the conversation brisk . She 'd nearly done two before she dropped her forehead on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her hair . " What is it ? " " Nothing . " She drew herself away and with her head bent finishedbuttoning his shirt.  | " Tess . " With a hand under her chin , he lifted her face . Tears swam in her eyes . He brushed one from her lashes with his thumb . " Do n't . " " I 'm not going to . " But her breath hitched before she pressed her cheek to his . " Just a minute , okay ? " " Yeah . " He put his good arm around her and absorbed the basicpleasure of being cared about . Some women had been turned on by his job , others repulsed by it , but he was n't sure he 'd ever had anyone who just cared . " I was scared , " she admitted , her voice muffled against him . " Me too . " " Later , will you tell me about it ? " " If I have to . A guy hates to admit to his woman that he was a jerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure the little sonofabitch was inside . Ed had the window , I had the door . Very simple . " When he drew away , he saw her gaze go to his ripped and bloodstained shirt . " You think this is bad , you should see my jacket . I just bought it two months ago . " In control again , she took his arm and led him down the hall . " Well , maybe Santa will bring you a new one for Christmas . Do you want me to drive you home ? " " No , thanks . I 've got a report to file . And if the other kid has n't spilled his guts by now , I want to be in on the interrogation . " " So there were two . " " There 's only one now . " She thought of the shrouded figure on the gurney . Because she could smell the dried blood on Ben 's shirt , Tess said nothing . " There 's Ed . " " Oh , God , he 's reading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but very thorough study , then smiled at Tess . " Hi , Dr. Court . I must have missed you when you came in . " He did n't mention the fact that when she 'd arrived , he 'd been donating a pint of blood . Both he and Ben were A Positive . Setting the magazine aside , he gave Ben his jacket and hol/ster . " Too bad about the coat . It should only take the department till April to process the papers and replace it . " " Ai n't it the truth ? " With Ed 's help Ben managed to heft on his holster and the damaged jacket . " You know , I just read this fascinating article about kidneys . " " Save it , " Ben advised , and turned to Tess . " You going back to the clinic ? " " Yes , I left in the middle of a session . " It was n't until that momentthat Tess fully realized she had put him ahead of a patient . " Speaking as a doctor , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've filed your report . I 'll be home around six-thirty , and could probably be persuaded to pamper you . " " Define pamper . " Ignoring him , she turned to Ed . " Why do n't you come to dinner , Ed ? " Initially he looked perplexed by the invitation , then pleased . " Well , I  --  Thanks . " " Ed 's not used to articulating to women . Come on over , Ed . Tess 'll fix you bean curds . " He stepped outside , grateful for the rush of cold air . His arm was no longer numb , but beginning to throb like a toothache . " Where are you parked ? " He was already scanning the lot for the black and white . " Just over there . " " Walk the lady to her car , will you , Ed ? " Taking her by the front of her coat , he kissed her hard . " Thanks for coming by . " " You 're welcome . " She waited until he 'd started toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look out for him ? " " Sure . " Digging her keys out of her pocket , she nodded . " The man who stabbed Ben is dead ? " " Yeah . " He took the keys from her , and in a gesture she found sweet , unlocked the car himself . Tess looked at his face and saw , as clearly as if he 'd spoken , who had fired the shot . Her values , the code she lived by , warred briefly with a new awareness . Putting ap244hand on his collar , she drew him down and kissed him . " Thanks for keeping him alive . " She got in the car , smiling up at him before she shut the door . " See you at dinner . " Half in love with her himself , Ed walked back to his partner . " You do n't go to Thanksgiving dinner , you 're one dumb sonofabitch . " Ben shook off grogginess as Ed slammed the car door . " What ? " " And you should n't need her Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started the engine with a roar . " Ed , did you get a bad piece of granola ? " " You better start looking at what 's in front of your face , partner , before you end up tripping over the saw . " " Saw ? What saw ? " " Farmer 's sawing wood , " Ed began as he drove off the lot . " City slicker 's watching him . Dinner bell rings and the farmer starts moving but he trips over the saw . He just picks himself up and starts cutting wood again . Slicker asks him why he does n't go in to dinner and the farmer says , since he tripped over the saw , it 's no use going in . There wo n't be anything left . " Ben sat in silence for a full ten seconds . " That explains it . Why do n't you turn back around , we 'll go into the hospital and have them take a look at you ? " " The point is , if you fuck around when opportunity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You got a hell of a woman , Ben . " " I think I know that . " " Then you better be damn careful you do n't trip over the saw . "  |p245IT  WAS JUST BEGINNING to snow when Joey walked out ofthe back door . Knowing the storm door rattled , he pulled it carefullyclosed until it latched . He 'd remembered to take his gloves , and had even pulled his blue ski cap over his head . Rather than changing to boots , he kept on his high tops . They were his favorite . No one saw him leave . His mother was in the den with his stepfather . He knew they 'd been arguing about him , because their voices had been pitched low and had carried that thin , nervous tone their voices carried whenever they argued about him . They did n't think he knew . His mother had roasted a turkey with all the trimmings . Throughout the meal she had chatted brightly , too brightly , about it being nice to have Thanksgiving with just the family . Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd baked himself . There 'd been cranberry sauce and real butter and the little crescent rolls that popped up fluffy in the oven . It had been the most miserable meal of Joey 's life . His mother did n't want him to have any problems . She wantedp246him to be happy , do well in school , and go out for basketball . Normal . That was the word Joey had heard her use in an urgent undertoneto his stepfather . I just want him to be normal . But he was n't . Joey guessed his stepfather sort of understood that , and that 's why they argued . He was n't normal . He was an alcoholic , just like his father . His mother said his father was NO GOOD . Joey understood that alcoholism was a disease . He understood addiction and that there was no cure , only a continuing period of recovery . He also understood that there were millions of alcoholics , and that it was possible to be one and live the normal life his mother wanted so badly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes he got tired of making the effort . If he told his mother he was tired , she would get upset . He knew , too , that alcoholism could often be inherited . He 'd inherited his from his father , the same way he 'd inherited the NO GOOD . The streets were quiet as he headed out of the nice , tidy neighborhood . Snowflakes fluttered in the beam of streetlights like the fairy dancers in storybooks he remembered his mother reading him years before . He could see the illumination in windows where people were eating their Thanksgiving meal or resting after the effort in front of the TV . His father had n't come for him . He had n't called . Joey thought he understood why his father did n't love him anymore . He did n't like to be reminded about the drinking and the fighting and the bad times . Dr. Court said his father 's disease had n't been Joey 's fault . But Joey figured if he 'd gotten the sickness from his father , then maybe , somehow , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying in bed , knowing it was late , and hearing his father shout in that thick nasty voice he used when he 'd been drinking a lot . " All you think about is that kid . You never think about me . Everything changed after we had him . "  |p247Then  later he had heard his father cry , big , wet sobs which were somehow even worse than the temper . " I 'm sorry , Lois . I love you , I love you so much . It 's the pressure that makes me like this . Those bastards at work are always on my back . I 'd tell them all to get fucked tomorrow , but Joey needs a new pair of shoes every time I turn around . " Joey waited for a car to rumble past , then crossed the street and headed for the park . Snow was falling thickly now , a white curtain buffeted by the wind . The air whipped healthy pink into his cheeks . Once he 'd thought if he had n't needed new shoes , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd realized things would be easier on everyone if he just was n't there . So he 'd run away when he 'd been nine . It had been scary because he 'd gotten lost and it had been dark and there 'd been noises . The police had found him in a few hours , but to Joey it had seemed like days . His mother had cried and his father had held him so tight . Everyone had made promises they had meant to keep . For a while things had been better . His father had gone to AA and his mother had laughed more . That was the Christmas Joey had gotten his twowheelerand his father had spent hours running beside the bike with his hand hooked under the seat . He had n't let Joey fall , not even once . But just before Easter his father had started coming home late again . Joey 's mother 's eyes had stayed red , and the laughter had stopped . One night Joey 's father had taken the turn into the drivewaytoo wide and had n't seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouting . Joey had woken up to the swearing , the accusations . His father had wanted to get Joey out of bed and take him outside to show him what his negligence had done . His mother had blocked the way . That was the first night he 'd heard his father strike his mother . If he 'd put the bike away instead of leaving it on the lawn beside the driveway , his father would n't have hit it . Then his father would n't have gotten so angry . His father would n't have hit his mother and given her a bruise on her cheek she tried to hide with makeup . That was the first night Joey tried alcohol . He had n't liked the taste . It had hurt his mouth and made hisp248stomach rise up uncomfortably . But when he 'd sipped from the bottlethree or four times , he felt strangely as if he 'd slipped on a thin plastic shield . He did n't feel like crying anymore . There had been a nice , quiet buzz in his head as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep . From that night Joey had used alcohol as an anesthetic wheneverhis parents fought . Then the divorce had come in a horrible culmination of arguments , shouting , and name calling . One day his mother had picked him up at school to drive him to a small apartment . There she explained to him as gently as possible why they would n't be living with his father any longer . He 'd been ashamed , horribly ashamed , because he 'd been glad . They 'd started their new life . His mother had gone back to work . She cut her hair and no longer wore her wedding ring . But Joey noticedfrom time to time the thin circle of white skin the band had covered for over a decade . He could still remember how anxious , how pleading her eyes had been when she 'd explained to him about the divorce . She 'd been so afraid he would blame her , so she 'd justified a move that left her riddled with guilt and uncertainty by telling him what he already knew . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd had left . He could remember , too , how hard she 'd cried the first time she came home from work to find her eleven-year-old son drunk . The park was quiet . On the ground a thin , pretty layer of white had already formed . In another hour no one would notice his footprints . Joey thought that was the way it should be . Snow was falling now in big , soft flakes which clung to the branches of trees and lay glistening and fresh on bushes . Flakes melted on his face , making his skin damp , but he did n't mind . He wondered , only briefly , if his mother had gone up to his room yet and discovered him gone . He was sorry she was going to be upset , but he knew what he was doing would make things easier for everyone . Especially himself . He was n't nine years old this time . And he was n't afraid . He 'd gone to Alateen and Alanon meetings with his mother.  |p249They  did n't reach him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to admit he was ashamed to be like his father . Then Donald Monroe had come along . Joey wanted to be glad his mother was happy again , then felt guilty because he was so close to accepting a replacement for his father . His mother was happy again , and Joey was glad because he loved her so much . His father grew more and more bitter , and Joey resented the change because he loved his father so much . His mother married and her name changed . It was no longer the same as Joey 's . They moved into a house in a quietly affluent neighborhood . Joey 's room overlooked the backyard . His father complained about the child-support payments . When Joey had begun to see Tess , he was finding a way to get drunk every day , and he 'd already begun to contemplate suicide . He had n't liked going to see her at first . But she had n't pulled at him or pressured or claimed to understand . She 'd just talked . When he stopped drinking , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetual calendar that he could use forever . " You have something to be proud of today , Joey . And every day when you get up in the morning , you 'll have something to be proud of . " Sometimes , he 'd believed her . She never gave him that quick , sharp look when he walked into the room . His mother still did . Dr. Court had given him the calendarand believed in him . His mother still waited for him to disappointher . That 's why she 'd taken him out of his school . That 's why she would n't let him hang around with his friends . You 'll make new friends , Joey . I only want the best for you . She only wanted him not to be like his father . But he was . And when he grew up he might have a son , and his son would be like him . It would never stop . It was like a curse . He 'd read about curses . They could be passed from generation to generation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept under his mattress explained the ceremony for exorcizing evil . He 'd followed it point by point one night when his mother and stepfather **26;15194;TOOLONG do mean it . And all this time everyone thought you served Oruc because your daughter was a hostage . Turns out you really were loyal . A weakling . " The headkeeper slapped him lightly on the cheek . " You were nothing , and now you 're less than nothing . " He doused the lights and left . As soon as he was gone and the brass key turned in the lock , Patiencelifted the grating and dropped into the room . " Hullo , Father , " she said . She fumbled in the darkness until she found his breath bladder . Then she pumped air so he could speak . " Go away , " he said . " I already taught you everything I know . " " I know , " she said . " Now I want you to tell me everything you fear . " " I do n't fear anything now , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I have n't done without pain in three years . Go away . " " You have neither bladder nor urine , Father . It 's just an illusion . " " The only reality a human being ever knows , my darling girl , is what his nerves tell him , and mine are telling me that  --  oh , you viciousand ungrateful worm of a girl , the headworms are torturing me again because I 'm resisting you . " " Then do n't resist me , Father . " " I 'm not your father , I 'm a piece of dead brain tissue kept alive by the probing tendrils of the gools and stimulated by trained worms . " " You never were my father . " Was that a catch in his throat ? A tiny gasp of surprise ? " You always made speeches to me , for the servants to overhear . Angel was the only father I had . " " Do n't waste your time trying to hurt me . I 'm past hurting . " " Did you ever love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did , I certainly do n't love you anymore . The only thing I desire now is to urinate forever . I would gladly trade a daughter for a decent prostate . " She found the matches where the headkeepers had set them down , and lit a single lamp . Her father 's eyes blinked in the light . She smiled at him . " You 're going to tell Oruc everything , but you 're going to tell me first . All my life you 've been able to keep secrets from me . But not anymore . " " You do n't need to know any of the secrets . I saw to it you knew everything . I thought you were intelligent enough to know that every word Angel spoke to you came originally from my lips . " " He told me that you would willingly let me die if it would serve the best interests of the King 's House . "  | " What would you rather ? That I tell you that I thought your life was more important than the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A human being , " she said . " The worst kind of monster , " he said . " We 're all monsters , living in utter isolation , sending out words like ambassadors that beg for tribute , for worship . Love me , love me . And then when the words come back , ' I love you , I worship you , you are great and good , ' these monsters doubt , these monsters know that it 's a lie . ' Prove it , ' they say . ' Obey me , give me power . ' And when they are obeyed , the monster grows hungrier . ' How do I know you are n't manipulating me ? ' cries the monster . ' If you love me , die for me , kill for me , give all to me and leave nothing for yourself ! ' " " If human beings are all monsters , why should I sacrifice anything for them ? " " Because they are beautiful monsters , " he whispered . " And when they live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust the world and their deepest hungers are fulfilled , then within that system , that delicate web , there is joy . That is what we live for , to bind the monsters together , to murder their fear and give birth to their beauty . " " That 's as mystical as what the priests babble about . " " It is what the priests babble about . " " You have sacrificed the possibility of power , you have made us strangers all these years , and all for some invisible , nonexistent connectionbetween human beings you 've never even met ? " She tried to put as much contempt as possible into her voice . " You 're fifteen . You know nothing . Go away . " " I know your life has been a deception and a disguise . " " And when I dropped the disguise and told you what I have lived for , you mocked me . The babble of the priests ! Do you think that because something is invisible , it does n't exist ? There is nothing but empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing connecting them is their behavior , their influence on each other , and yet out of those empty , invisible connections is built all that exists in the universe . Most of it empty , the web insensible . Yet if for a single moment the web broke down , everything would flash out of existence . Do you think it 's any different for us ? Do you think that you exist independent of your connections with other people ? Do you think that you can ever serve your own interest without also serving theirs ? Thenp52I should have killed you in the cradle , because you are n't fit to be Heptarch . " She saw in his face the same fervency she had seen in Prekeptor . Father , too , was a believer . But she could not believe that this was a belief that anyone could sacrifice for . " Was this the secret you hid from me all these years ? Was this what you would have said to me if for one single moment we could have been alone and honest with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ? " He had taught her how to show devastating contempt , as a diplomatic tool . She used it now : " I could have learned as much from any teacher in the School . " His face went slack again , went back to the neutral expression that he cultivated when he wished to show nothing . " If you do n't get out of here at once , before Oruc or his men get here , you 're quite likely to be with me in loving proximity for the next thousand years , getting sucked out by gools in a bowl of soup . I do n't like you well enough to want your company . I used to think you were a well-behaved child , but now I see you 're a selfish , inconsiderate brat . " " No , " she said . " There are things I need to know . Practical things , that I can use to survive . " " Survival I taught you from infancy . You 'll survive . Go away . " " What was it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mockingly devoted expression . " That you would die . I did all that I did to keep you alive . Why else do you think I served the Usurper 's Son so faithfully ? He had you hostage here . " He wanted her to believe that he was lying . But she could also see that the headworms were not tormenting him . He had told her the truth . He simply did n't want her to know it was the truth . So she was asking the questions that would give her the answers she wanted . " Why were you afraid of my death ? " " Because I loved you . Back when I was alive . I remember it dimly . " But this was a lie . She could see the trembling around his lips ; the headworms were in control of his nerves , and tortured him in unconcealableways when he resisted . So it was n't love . It was something else . And thinking of that took her back to a time in her early childhood , to the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face now that reminded her of his face that night . " You lied to me that night , " she said . " I realize now , you lied about some-thing. "  | " What night ? " he asked . " What was it you did n't tell me , Father , the night they brought you Mother 's body in seven sacks ? " " You remember that ? " " For some reason it sticks in my mind . " lie raised an eyebrow . " I do n't remember it . " " Now more than ever you remember . " " God help me , if I must remember that night , then have the grace to take me from this rack and let me die . " " That night when you opened the first sack and saw what it was , you , pouted , I ' 11 never go , I 'll never let you have her , not my daughter , imt ever . ' Who were you shouting at ? What was it that made you so afraid ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or since . " " I was afraid of King Oruc , of course . " " You never were afraid of him . And lying does you no good  --  see what the headworms do with you ? " Abruptly he changed tactics . He smiled , and wryly said , " Even the hcadkeeper had some mercy . Now I feel like I 've been constipated for a month and a diarrhea attack is beginning . You have no idea how bad these worms can be . " " Tell me now and have your ease . " Lightly he said , as if it did n't matter , " I feared the call to Cranning . It was the caller that I shouted at , whoever it was . " " Who else could it be but the gebling king ? " asked Patience . " Oh , you think you 've solved it ? " " Angel told me that the gebling kings have always been able to commandtheir people without a word . From mind to mind . " " Did Angel tell you that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We 're deaf as a post when the geblings cry out to each other . " " The Cranning call  --  if it is n't the geblings , who is it , and why do Nine fear it ? " " I do n't know who it is , but I fear him . I fear what he can do to people . The Wise of Grandfather 's day were brilliant and strong , the greatest minds in the history of the world , working together , building ni each other 's learning , until they did things that had never been done on any world . Here , where iron is so hard to find that we can rely on the machines that have always made humans powerful ,  |p54they  unlocked the powers of life . They were n't just petty breeders , like the Tassaliki , like the ancient scientists who created these headworms and gools four thousand years ago  --  those were mountebanks by comparison . The Wise of Grandfather 's day had taught the chromosomes to name themselves in crystals , atom for atom , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye . They had found how passion fish mate with clams to make cressid plants . And when I was born , they changed me so that I could never sire anything but sons . " Patience thought about that for a moment . " They did it so the prophecy would n't be fulfilled . So there 'd be no seventh seventh seventhdaughter . " " That was the plan . " " Why did you change your mind ? Why did you have Angel undo what they did ? Surely you did n't become a Watcher . " " No , not a Watcher . The Wise did this to me when I was still a child . As soon as they had made my body incapable of siring girlchildren , the Cranning call began . One by one , the best of them began to leave . They would go off to teach somewhere . They would retire to a country home . They would be sent as ambassadors or governors . But they would never arrive at their destination . Instead they would be seen along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was Heptarch then ? " " Not yet . My father watched what happened to the empire , as all the able men disappeared . He went to them and begged them not to go . The ones who had n't yet felt the Cranning call vowed most solemnly to stay . The ones who had felt it , though  --  they promised anything , but they broke all their promises . And Grandfather did nothing to stop it . It was a frightening time , with provinces in rebellion , the army in disarray . Father finally had Grandfather arrested and took over the government . " " So the Usurper was n't the first to overthrow a Heptarch . " " For the good of the King 's House , even treason . Yes . But it was too late . Even when he tortured some of them , even when he killed some as an example , they went . Even when he cut off their heads and put them here , in Slaves ' Hall , the Cranning call was so strong in their minds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call was more urgent than anything the headworms could do to them . " " What were they wanted for ? "  | " Do you think Father did n't try to find out ? But they themselves did n't know . And no one ever knew what became of them , once they got to Cranning . Father 's spies never came back . And after a few years , the empire was lost . Twelve of the Fourteen Families were in revolt . Onic 's father led it . But he was n't called the Usurper then . He was called the Liberator . He came , he said , to restore Grandfather to his rightful place on the Heptarch 's throne . " " Ah . " " Father should have killed Grandfather . " " As Oruc should have killed us ? " " Grandfather was n't the  --  seventh seventh seventh daughter . " Lord Peace closed his eyes . Patience knew that if he still had his body , he would put his fingertips together , then touch them to his mouth ; she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his death well up in her for the first time , seeing him half-alive like this , remembering him whole . She shook off the feeling . " How was I born , Father ? " " My father lost the city of Heptam before I came of age . I led one army , he led another . He lost and was captured and killed . I never lost . I wandered the wilderness with an ever-shrinking guerrilla band . One by one my sons came to adulthood . One by one they were killed . The enemy seemed to find my boys so easily  --  as if some traitor led them . It was as if some terrible invisible power guided them to destroy everyonebut me . Everyone but me . My first wife , my father , my children , and I alone was alive . " " So you could sire the daughter of prophecy . " " I studied the chronicles . I realized that my family 's fall began almost the moment they undaughtered me . That was the crime for which the Wise were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patience , the prophecies that these men of science had long thought were mere superstition  --  someone or something of great power meant to have them fulfilled . And we thought  --  perhaps if we find a way to undo what was done . Perhaps if I could have a girlchild , then the Wise would come home , and all could be restored as it was . Peace could be restored to the world . But how could we undo the work of the Wise , so limy daughter could be born ? Who would know how to do it , when the Wise were all gone ? " " Angel , " said Patience . " I know this story . "  | " I was in my forties then . He came to me , a very young man then , and said he had been studying the journals of the great men , and he thought he knew a way to refresh and revivify my woman-making sperm . He explained , but I could not understand it  --  I know what every educated man knows about genetics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , catalysts and countercatalysts and inducers and blocks . I said to him , You know too much . You 've becomeone of the Wise . The Cranning call will come to you . ' He only smiled and said , Lord Peace , my Heptarch , if the caller wants you to have a daughter , then he will leave me here . ' " " So my birth ... served the purpose of the Cranning call . " " Angel and I argued over it . Better to be castrated than to give in to what this enemy wants , I said . But it came to this : We did n't know what purpose the Cranning call might have for you , but we knew that as long as you remained unborn , the world was in turmoil . We were at Ilium at the time , under the protection of Lady Hekat . She told us , The prophecies are ambiguous . The seventh seventh seventh daughter is called the destruction of the world , and the salvation of the world . Why not let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a savior ? ' So I took Lady Hekat as my second wife , and Angel made the change in me , and you were born . " " Lady Hekat . " Patience saw her mother 's face as it had been the last time she saw her . Weeping as the soldiers took Patience away from her . Crying out , My daughter , my daughter , my child , God be with you , always with you ; and then the knock on Father 's door , and the sudden cry of agony as father looked into the bag that was delivered there . I saw his face . His face , Mother 's face , the same agony . " And you trained me to be an assassin , " she said . " I taught you to serve the King 's House . However much you think you hate me now , I know you . You will always act for the good of the King 's House . You are the hope of humanity . Not as the Watchers and Vigilants believe , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know it . " " I 'm a child , fifteen years old . I 'm the hope of nothing . I have no great purpose . " " If you have no purpose of your own , then you will fulfill the purposeof the Cranning call . It waits for you , Daughter . But Angel and I have done all we could to teach you what the Heptarch lives for . If you have n't learned it , we could do no more . "  | " You do n't know anything , Father . You do n't know who is calling from Cranning , you do n't know what he wants me for , and you do n't even know me . " " How could I know you , Patience ? I felt the Cranning call , too . Are you surprised ? I never felt it until you were born , but then it began . A terrible urgency to take you there , to carry you to Skyfoot and give you  --  to whatever waits there . Whenever I was with you , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything these petty worms can do to me . So I have spent as little time with you as I could , for fear I would break under the pain of it , and carry you off before you were ready . " " Ready for what ? " " To face whatever waits there . " " Am I ready now ? " " How can I know ? But you 're as ready as I could make you in my life . Trust Angel now . He is the last of the Wise , the only one who can protect you from the thing that calls . From Unwyrm . " " You know its name ? " " One prophecy says that you will take the world into Unwyrm 's lair and give it to him , and all mankind will die and be reborn . It 's the only prophecy that gives a name . " " Who made the prophecy ? " " A prophet , I suppose . What matters is that the Cranning call is proof that the prophecies are true  --  or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same thing . " " There 's no such thing as an undefeatable power , " said Patience . " You always taught me that . " " Go now , Patience . I 've told you everything . Now do n't let them find you here , or my whole life was for nothing . And if they ask me , I 'll have to tell them that I saw you . It 'll give them a fresh trail . " Almost she obeyed him . But then she realized that he had not fully answered her . There was still a twitching in his face , a sign that he was resisting , that he had not told her all that she had asked for . " One more story , " she said . " No more . " " The one you do n't want to tell me . " The face grimaced as the head tried to resist the urging of the worms . " Leave me in peace , child ! Let my name be something more than a terrible irony . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is the thing I most badly need to know . " " You 're wrong , you fool ! If you needed to know I would have told you ! Leave me this one secret to take to the grave . " " I 'll have it from you , Father ! I 'll have it , or wait here until Oruc takes me ! " Finally , sweating and weeping , the head spoke . Patience pumped steadily , but the voice was high and strange . " The priests say that the Starship Captain was taken in the spirit by God , made some prophecies , and then disappeared into heaven . " " I know the tales . " " I know the truth . The captain of the starship Konkeptoine went mad as our ancestors orbited the world . It 's true that he wrote the prophecy with his right hand in the ship 's log . He also drew the map of the world , showing all the great deposits of iron and coal , the stuff that steel is made of . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In that one act he determined the future of the world . Imakulatais not naturally poor in iron . Because of his insane act of destruction , we children of the great engine builders are deprived of steel . We have no great machines . We are weaker in this world than human beings have ever been before . " " If he was insane enough to do that , why did anyone think he was a prophet ? " " Because his map was more accurate than the one the ship 's own mind drew . He knew things about the world that could not be known . They said at the time he seemed to be possessed . I who have felt the Cranning call know now that this was probably true . Whatever controlledhim in the ship , that compulsive power is still alive . He left the ship in a landing craft and was never seen again . His craft was never found . " " If something like this happened , why is n't it in any of the histo-ries ? " " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historians know . I meant you to know this much , anyway ; I told Angel , and he was to tell you . The priests know only of the map he drew with his right hand , and the words he spoke with his mouth . The words that his possessor wanted us to believe . Words about how Kristos would come to Imakulata and make the human race new and perfect . But his daughter Irena , the first Heptarch , she saw something that onlyp59the Heptarchs know : As he spoke the prophecy and drew the map with his right hand , his left hand slowly tapped out into the mind of the ship , Save my daughter from the lair of the wyrms , or they will devour all mankind . ' " " His daughter  --  " " Not Irena , child . You . His distant daughter . At first they did n't know how distant . There were prophecies that it would be the seventh seventh daughter . Magic numbers . Only in the last thousand years have there been prophets who said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be the seventh seventh seventh daughter of the Starship Captain . " " Then there 's no reason to believe that the prophecy is anything more than the raving of a Vigilant . " " Of course . Except that the Cranning call obviously intends to fulfill that prophecy . I have no doubt that you are the daughter that needs saving , as the Starship Captain warned . " " But what is the lair of the worms  --  this ? The headworms ? " " He wrote a word that in Star Speech , the most ancient of languages , means monster , ' and not just any monster , but the most dangerous and cunning and powerful of enemies . An enemy powerful enough to take control of the Starship Captain 's mind while the Konkeptoinestill orbited Imakulata . An enemy powerful enough to call all the Wise to Cranning . Do you understand the danger of the world , Patience ? We are facing an enemy that formed its plans seven thousand years ago , when we first arrived here . Whatever ruled Imakulata before humankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gebling then . They were the highest native life , as intelligent as humankind  --  " " Were they ? Then why is Geblic merely another corrupt form of Star Speech ? And Dwelf and Gauntish , why did they have to take their language from mankind ? They rose to where they are when humanity arrived ; there was something more powerful , an intelligence older than they . I meant for Angel to warn you of this . I did n't mean for you to be ignorant of it . But that 's all now . That 's all , now go . " But even now , there was more , she could see what the headworms told her , that he was hiding still another secret from her . The headkeeperhad n't broken him . His power of resistance was still strong . But she would do what the headkeeper had failed to do . She would break him and have from him the tale he did n't want to tell.  | " I know you better than that , Father , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would have killed me in my childhood . " " The Starship Captain did n't say to kill his daughter . He said to save her . And even if he had not said so , I could not have killed you . Anyone else could die , child , anyone at all , but you would live . To destroy mankind or to save the world , I can not guess , but you would live , whatever the cost . " " Why ! Not because I 'm your daughter  --  so why ! " His face twisted in agony . She had asked him the unbearable question , and the headworms would torture the answer from him . But even as she realized this , she also remembered something else . This was the expression on his face the night of Mother 's death . This was the mask of pain he wore . " In all your talking , Father , you never told me what you meant when you cried out on the night they brought Mother 's body to you . " His mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Cranning call . For me , the need was n't for me to come . It was to bring you . Whole and alive . When I was n't with you , I felt no call at all . " " That does n't answer my " Your mother was always with you . She was also called . She was weaker than I was . She tried to take you . That 's why I carried you away from her . She vowed she would never rest until she had you back , that she would do anything to get you away from me . " Even now , though the dread was thick within her , she could not bring herself to understand what he meant . " Listen , foolish girl ! Did n't Angel and I teach you how to listen ? My father was weak enough to let Grandfather live , when he should have died . I was stronger than my father was . Hekat meant to take you to Cranning . I had no strength to kill you , against the Cranning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped pumping breath for him . " You , " she whispered . " You told me it was a group of soldiers trying to curry favor with Oruc . You told me  --  they were even executed for it  --  but it was you . " His lips formed words as he ran out of air . I never meant to tell you . His eyes accused her . You made me tell you , and you did n't need to know.  |p61It  was more than she could bear . " Why did n't you let her take me to Cranning . I would rather have suffered anything , and have her live . " " The King 's House is all the world , " said his lips . " You were n't the Heptarch ! You did n't have any responsibility for the whole world ! You did n't have to kill my mother ! " And she swept him from the table , spilling him to the floor . At once she rushed to him , to lift the head back to the table , restore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at her steadily as she knelt over him , and his lips moved and said , Let me die . So she did the only thing she could do . She took Lord Peace by the jaw and tore the head away from the rack that held it . The headworms wriggled in the open air and the gools slid off and slopped onto the floor . All the time her father 's eyes looked at her in gratitude and love . Then , gasping with grief and fury , she tossed the head through the open grate in the ceiling and climbed up after it . She carried it with her for ten minutes as she scrambled through the heating system to the vent by the garrison barracks . By then it was dead beyond reviving , and she thought of leaving it at the barracks door . Let the soldiers explain to King Oruc how she got it there without being seen . No . She could not leave his head like the carcass of a cat in the street . Not that he would care  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself she was concerned for , Patience who could not bear to treat even this fragment of her father 's body with disrespect . What she could not understand was why she did not hate him . He had killed Mother . All his weeping when they showed how she had been mutilated , all his grief , all his embraces as he tried to comforthis daughter  --  and he was the one who killed her . All because of some madness about an ancient prophecy . Seven thousand years ago their ancestor went mad , and a few hundred thinkers took unlicensed trips to the gebling city , and for that her mother was murdered by her own husband . Yet it was this monster who had made her what she was . For her own honor , if not for his , she could not shame him in death . Notp62because she loved him . She certainly , certainly did not love him . As she made her way along the ledges of the cliff outside the wall of King 's Hill , she filled her father 's throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing into the sea.  |p63Angel  was supposed to be in disguise , lecturing on astrophysics in the School . But he was n't there . It did n't surprise her . She was supposed to have arrived almost as soon as word first reached the city that Peace was dead . Every minute she delayed made it more dangerous for Angel , who was not unknown and might be recognized despite his disguise . Perhaps he had stayed until nightfall  --  but he would certainly not have dared to stay the night inside the city . There were too many tongues paid well to wag , too many eyes that would see and remember the new teacher who had not been seen or heard of before . Perhaps , though , he would return in the morning . So , still passing as a boy , she passed the early hours of day like the many students searching for a teacher whose haranguing was particularly pleasing . She was tired , after a night without sleep . But part of her regimen had been sleeplessness , from time to time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Angel and Father had stretched her limits so far that she no longer knew where they were . She quickly recognized the spies circulating through the crowd . They had not been trained by Father or Angel ; they were not subtle , andp64Patience knew she was not the only one who could tell they were not earnest seekers after truth . Many a teacher became tongue-tied when a spy came near , and tried to purge his doctrine of anything that smacked of sedition . Patience also knew that the spies she saw were not the dangerous ones . It was the spies she could not discern who frightened her . So she made her way into Kingsport , the warehouse and shipping district that had once been a separate town and still had its own council and made some of its own laws . Great Market , only a short way up from the docks , stank of fish and sausages , alcohol and spice . It would not do to linger too long without buying  --  the merchants hired their own spies to search for thieves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stopped at the canopy of a man whose sign promised he could translate Agarant to Dwelf , Dwelf to Gauntish , Gauntish to Geblic , and then back to common speech without a word changed . It was so extravagant an impossibility that she liked the man at once . She leaned on his writing table . He looked up at her from heavy brows and thick moustaches and said , in Agarant , " Take your hands off my table or I 'll cut them off . " Patience answered in Panx that she knew was accentless . " My hands for your mealbag , it 's a fair trade . " He squinted at her . " Nobody ever needs Panx , " he said . " Do n't speak it myself . " She spoke now in Gablic . " Then perhaps you can use my services somewhere else . " " Did n't you understand me ? I do n't need Panx . " Now she spoke in common speech . " The last thing I said was in Geblic . So much for your sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could n't speak Agarant , so no one needs it anyway . How did you learn Panx and Geblic ? " " I 'm a gebling , " she said . " Your barber is very good . " He smiled . " Listen , boy , as long as you 're here , I could use a scribe . How 's your hand ? " " Good enough , as long as I can sit there in the shade , with something to keep sun off my neck . " " And the common gaze off your face , is that it ? " " I 'm not afraid of the common gaze , sir . " " Ah . It 's the uncommon gaze you dread . Come , sit , what do I care whom you 're hiding from , as long as you do n't steal from me ? Though by the grandmother of Kristos , there 's not much to steal . My name is Flanner . At least that 's what my merchant 's license says . "  |p65So  she sat through the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had scribbled . Often she corrected his tendency to translate idioms literally , giving the sense instead of the words ; if he noticed , he did n't say . He sent a streetboy for dinner at noon , and shared the food with her . At day 's end , when all the clients had come by and there was no work left except a book that was n't due till spring , Planner stood up and rubbed his hands together . " Still an hour till full Clark . What do you plan to do now ? " " Help you pitch your canopy . " " And then ? " " Ask you for six coppers for my day 's work . " " Let 's start with the canopy . " They took down the awning and the four posts . It all collapsed into sticks and cloth that fit inside his table ; two of the sticks became axles , and the table was now a cart . " Now , boy , it occurs to me that three times today I had to step over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Some have larger bladders than others , " she said . But she knew he would not give her the money , and he was perilously close to guessing who she was , if he had n't already . So she reached into her hair and took out her loop . She flipped it down across his wrist , caught the ends to form a circle around it , and smiled . " Twenty-five coppers with the other hand , " she said , " or you lose this one . " He saw the wire more than felt it . With only slight pressure it had cut into the skin and blood was forming droplets . His other hand took a purse from his belt . " So you 're a thief after all , " he said . " I did an honest day 's work , " she said . " But I charge extra when people try to cheat me . Spill the purse . " He poured out the coins on the tabletop . " A silver and five coppers , count them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , being careful not to move the caught hand any more than necessary . When he had pulled taut the string of the purse , she snatched it with one hand , letting the loop dangle from the other . He did not try to catch her , just held his bleeding wrist and panted in relief . " And remember that  --  leiok can be future tense as well as past . It gets you into more trouble . " She dodged away into the gathering dusk . Another day was ending , another day of putting herself at terrible risk in a public place , and Angel had n't found her . No doubt the rumor of the boy who could speak four languages and had almost cut off Flanner'sp66hand would reach his ear before morning  --  it was the kind of tale that spread fast through the taverns . Unfortunately , the King 's spies would also hear it , so she could n't wait for Angel to find her from the tales . Her purse bought her passage on an upriver boat . All the outbound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried gamblers and gamers to the Cuts needed no supervision , apparently . The porter who took her three coppers looked at her with squinting eyes . " You know they put cutpurses in the river in three pieces , " he said . Patience looked at the planks to avoid his gaze . So she looked like a thief in this company . Should n't be a surprise . Only the well off could play the Cuts , and she did n't exactly reek of money . But as Angel left , he had jokingly said that he figured to spend his time getting rich in the Cuts , because he was mathematician enough to control the odds . It was the only hint she had of where he 'd be , and so she acted on it . She paid the extra copper to use the privy house on the boat . It was a long pole upstream when the tide was out , and there was a queue . A very fat , foul-breathed woman got in line behind her . Her belly and breasts kept bumping into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to make a scene , though , and so bore it patiently . But when the man before her got out , to her horror the woman pushed her way into the privy behind her . Patience had never pictured herself having to kill someone quite so grossly fat . How deep would a weapon have to pierce in order to touch something vital ? It did n't matter  --  a throat was a throat . By the time the fat woman had the door closed , Patience had her loop out and easily cast it about the woman 's neck . " Make a sound and you 're dead , " said Patience . The woman made no sound . " I do n't want to kill you , " Patience said . " I do n't know if you meant to rob me or what , but if you keep silent and say nothing , I 'll let you finish this voyage alive . " " Please , " the fat woman whispered . Patience tightened the loop . A sudden slackening of resistance told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Patience said . " Angel , " the fat woman squeaked . She had n't expected that . She was keyed up against enemies , and had n't thought the woman might be a friend . " What about Angel ? " " He 's coming on the next boat . In the name of Cleanliness andp67Holiness and all the Sweet Smells , take that thing from around my neck . He said you were dangerous but he did n't say you were insane . " " Who are you ? " " Sken . I own a boat . I think I wet myself . " " Good . Then you do n't need the privy house . I do . Get out . " " You 're all heart . And what will they think , when I come out with my throat bleeding ? " " That you made an indecent offer to a young man in the privy , and he turned you down with vigor . I 'll meet you at the railing  --  now go . " " You 're a little turd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck . Patience barred the door and finally relieved herself . It had been a long day . Now she understood why the heads gave in so easily when the worms tortured them with these body urges . Angel had found her after all , apparently , had been watching her until he had a chance to send word to her . Whoever this woman was , Angel trusted her . No doubt the fact that she owned a boat played some part in his plans . But will it play a part in mine ? Patience wondered what Angel was to her now . Father 's slave , and so now hers , technically . But she knew he did n't really belong to her . It was n't just because she could n't take him into court to enforce her claim . He had served her father , not from fear , but from love and loyalty . One of the lessons of statecraft , Father often told her , was that loyalty could not be transferred or inherited ; it had to be earned by each new lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , or believe that he was still bound to carry out whatever Father 's last instructions to him might have been . Patience , though , did n't feel bound to obey Father . She obeyed him for the last time when she tore his head from the rack and cast it into the sea . His desires were not to be added into the balance anymore . She was not a child , now . She could decide for herself what to do with the burden of prophecy and doom that had attended from her birth , that had unthroned her grandfather and killed her half-brothers . And killed her mother , too ; dear Mother , who had died so cruelly at Father 's hands , and for my sake , all for my sake , Mother , if I could have , I would have died for you but now your death has bought for me all that it could buy  --  the years to become dangerous , too , in my own right . Have n't I killed in the name of the King ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eye ? Did n't I steal Father 's head out of Slaves ' Hall though all the soldiers in King 's Hill looked for me ? I amp68not a little child or a helpless Heptarch whose servants have made her soft . I will not refuse the path that prophecy has declared for me , but I will not be half so meek as prophecy thinks I 'll be . I will be more than a match for Unwyrm , whoever or whatever Unwyrm is . So she leaned on the gunnel of the boat as the oarsmen below decks swept the river , pushing the waves westward toward the sea . Glad Hell 's high prison wall loomed in the gathering night ; then the island was past them , and the lights of Heptam were visible far to the south , across the marshes . I am outside the prison walls now , she thought . I am outside King 's Hill , and I 'll never go back there , except as Heptarch . Inwardly she laughed at the thought . Whatever else she might be or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furthest out of reach . She would set herself to other tasks , and let the Heptarchy come to her if it would . King 's Hill was not the only prison she was free of . Those walls had always been the least of her jails . The training regimen was over . The constant tests and problems were ended . Never again would others determine her present and future according to their own desires . Insteadshe would go where she was born to go . To Cranning , the great Skyfoot city at the center of the world . How could she , for a moment , think of going anywhere else ? She felt a tingling of her skin at the thought of Cranning , a tremblingin her loins , a hunger deeper than any she had felt before in her life . Cranning . All roads go there , all rivers flow there , all time bends there , all life ends there . It became a pounding rhyme in her head . All roads go there . ( But Father killed Mother  --  ) All rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) All time bends there. (  --  who waits there , calling , calling  --  ) All life ends there . Over and over the rhyme , the need , filling her with a passion she had never felt before . She knew what it was . No one needed to explain it to her . The Cranning call.  |p69They  spent no time at all in the Cuts . Though Patience was fascinated by the glittering clothing and everyone 's passionate urgency to spend themselves all in one night , Sken led her at once to a small riverboat , the kind with a mast to help upstream when the wind was good , or to go out to sea on short runs , if there was a need . The heavy oars explainedwhy the fat woman 's arms were thick and muscular . Patience began to suspect , as Sken pulled them away from the island , that there was less fat on her than she had supposed at first . " We wait out here in the dark , " Sken whispered , " until his boat comes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was only a few minutes later ; this early in the evening , there was a lot of traffic from Kingsport up the Glad River to the Cuts . Angel 's disguise was good enough that Sken recognized him before Patience ( lid . She was looking for an aging scholar , or the gracious old woman lie sometimes had mimicked in the past . Instead , he was an obvious male whore , slightly drunk , painted till his face fairly glowed in the torchlight . " I thought the essence of disguise was to be inconspicuous , " Pa/tience said . The oars dipped into the water without a splash  --  Sken knew the river and had the strength to glide upstream without seeming to strain . " The essence of disguise is to be unnoticed , " said Angel . He dipped his hands into the river to wash his face . " You can do that by being so nondescript that no one notices you , or being so embarrassing that no one can stand to look at you . Either way , your disguise remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did you leave me in the tonguing booths all day ? " Patience said . She did n't like it when Angel proved that he still knew more than she did . " Where were you yesterday , little fool , when I stood there in the School with my face hanging out for any of the King 's asses to see me ? " " Talk softer , " Sken whispered . " The King 's patrol are known to anchortheir boats on the river and listen in the darkness for fools who think they 're alone . " They fell silent then . They passed the eastern edge of Cuts Island and began to pass among the pilings on which houses perched precariouslyhigh above the water . It was a district called Stilts  --  the town of the river people , who it was said were born and died without ever setting foot on land . It was n't true , of course , but they did spend most of their lives on the water . The story was they got seasick on land . If they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a shifting deck under them . Patience had always suspected they made up the stories themselves . " At high tide , " said Sken , " the water comes up to there . " She pointed to a level on the nearest piling about a meter above the water . " But in spring flood , there are weeks when we live in the attics , because the water on the first floor is three feet deep . " Patience marveled at that  --  the houses were all a good four meters above the water level . The land on the left bank , where the new town was rising , was high enough that it might not flood in the spring . But the marshland of the right bank must be under water for a good long time . Patience began to understand how the river controlled the way human beings lived here . Korfu had risen and fallen many times in seven thousand years . Heptam had been a provincial town and the center of the world . Yet in all that time , the river still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her thoughts , Angel said , " There was a levee on the right bank for a thousand years , and the marshland was heavily populated . But about five thousand years ago it was breached and no one rebuilt it . Within fifty years it was as if it had never been there . Time is against us . " The boat bumped up against a large piling . A house was built on this single massive stilt , with stabilizing boards angling off to triangulatewith the great beams . " Here , " said Sken . She tied the boat to the piling and climbed with surprising ease up a series of boards that made a sort of irregular ladder into the house . Then , before Patience could walk to that end of the boat to climb up , a net dropped down like a heavy spider . " She 's going to lift us up ? " asked Patience . " I brought some luggage with me , " said Angel . Patience recognized his small trunk . Of course . Her things he could leave somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his sight . She knew he kept his disguises in it , but there were other things , too , which he showed to no one . The trunk rose quickly upward into the house . Then Angel motioned for Patience to climb . The house swayed slightly when they walked from one end to another . To someone who lived on the river , it probably felt fine , but to Patience it was unnerving . It was like living in a constant earthquake , she thought . And when Sken moved from place to place , her great mass tilted it even more . She seemed not to notice it , and Patience said nothing . " I 'm sorry I did n't meet you on time , " Patience said . " I had some questions I had to ask Father . Questions I could only ask him when he was dead . " " I guessed as much , " said Angel . " Did you leave him there when you were through ? " " Oruc had enough use of him when he was alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no use of him now . " Sken was horrified . " You killed your father 's head ? " " Shut up and tend to the food , " Angel said softly . Sken glowered but obeyed . " He asked me to , " said Patience . " As any sane man would , " said Angel . " Just because we can preservep72them does n't mean we should . Just one more abomination we 'll have to answer for someday . " " To God ? I do n't think he cares what we do with our heads . " Sken could n't keep her silence . " If I 'd known you were blasphemers I would have put you at the bottom of the river . " It was Patience who answered this time . " And if I 'd known you were unable to keep your mouth still I would have left your head in the privy hole . " Angel smiled . " So you did have your loop on you ? " " I needed it twice . I was n't very subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sken . " Well , what did your father tell you ? " Patience looked at him coldly . " He told me what he said you were going to tell me . " " What is that ? " " Tell me what you 're supposed to tell me , and I 'll see if it agrees . " " Patience , I know more games than I ever taught you . If you tell me what secrets he told you , then I do n't have to go on lying to you for the next thirty years . " " Did you know about how mother died ? " asked Patience . Angel grimaced . " I see you did n't ask him easy questions . " " He broke in two hours . I thought he had more strength than that . " " He had more strength than anyone . " " He whined and whimpered  --  and when the worms punished him , he even wept . " Angel nodded gravely . " Of course . " " What do you mean , of course ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught me that the emotion I showed should never be the emotion I felt , and there he was  --  " She stopped , feeling stupid . " Yes ? " asked Angel . " There he was , showing emotions and I fell for it . " " Ah . So perhaps he did n't break at all . " " He was n't lying to me . I saw when he was lying , and I saw when he stopped . He ca n't hide everything . Can he ? " " No . I think he told you the truth . What else , besides your mother 's death ? " " Was n't that enough ? "  | " The prophecy ? " " I knew a little about that anyway . He told me what the Starship Captain did with his left hand . " " Angel , I 've decided where I want to go . " " Your father left me strict instructions . " " My father is dead now , and you belong to me . " Sken was surprised . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking orders from a slave ? " " I am the slave of a Slave of the King . That puts me so far above you that you 're unworthy to inhale one of my farts . Now will you shut up , woman ? " Actually , thought Patience , I 'm the Heptarch now . You 're Slave to the King herself . Her only Slave . Much may it profit you . " So , " said Angel . " Where do you want to go ? " " Cranning , " said Patience . Angel was angry , though he answered with humor . " Stiff as steel , the girl has lost her mind . " Now Sken was livid . " Girl ! Girl ! You mean this snip of a boy is a female ? It is an abomination for the woman to wear the clothing of the man , and the man to wear the clothing of a woman  --  " " Shall I kill her to get us some silence ? " Angel asked . Sken fell silent , stuffing hardbread into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Angel , " that is the one place you can never go . " " I 'm sure of it , " she said . " But it 's the one place I have to go . I was born for it , do n't you see ? " " You were born for something better than to go off fulfilling mad prophecies . " " How will you stop me . Kill me ? Because it 's the only way you ever will . " " It 's the Cranning call . That 's what makes you want to go . It comes this way , an insane determination to go there , for no reason at all , against all reason  --  " " Do n't you think I know ? " Angel chewed on that for a moment . " So you think that whatever it is , you 're stronger . " " I think that if it can call the wisest men out of the world and forcep74my mother to want to sacrifice her daughter , then someone needs to stop it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind will be reborn ? " " When Kristos comes , " muttered Sken . " The prophets were given their visions and prophecies by whatever it is that calls , " said Angel . " They might be lies , to entice you . " " Then I 'm enticed . If you 're so wise , Angel , why have n't you felt the Cranning call ? " Angel went cold , his face a hard-set mask . She had always had the gift of goading him . " No one ever proved that every wise one heard the call . " There was no need to hurt him ; she was using diplomatic tricks on a man whose honest words she would need again and again . So she smiled and touched his hand . " Angel , you spent your life making me as wise and dangerous as possible . When will I be readier ? When you 're too old to come with me ? When I 've fallen in love with some cod and had three babies that I have to protect ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Or maybe now . When I 'm willing to die . When I 've lost my father for the first time and my mother all over again . Now , when I 'm willing to kill because of the rage that burns in me for what has been stolen from me and my father and my mother , now is the time for me to face whatever waits for me there . With you or without you , Angel . But better with you . " Angel smiled . " All right . " Patience glared at him . " That was too easy . You intended to be persuaded all along . " " Come now , Patience . Your father warned us both that the worst thing in the world was waiting in Cranning . As well as we knew him , and as well as he knew us , do n't you think he knew we 'd come to this moment ? " Patience remembered her father 's head . Was he scheming even then , letting her force from him the very truths that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care if he was , " she said . " Even if my father really wanted me to go , I 'll go . " " Good . Tonight then . We do n't want another day here . " He took a purse from his belt and took out two large steel coins . " Sken , do you know what these are worth ? "  | " If they 're real , then you 're a damned fool for carrying them without a bodyguard . " " Are they enough to buy your boat ? " Sken squinted at him . " You know it 's enough to buy ten of my boats . If they are steel . " He tossed them to her . She bit them and weighed them in her hand . " I 'm not a fool , " she said . " You are if you think they are n't real , " said Angel . " I wo n't sell you the boat unless you buy me , too . " " Buy you ! That 's enough to buy your silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I said I 'm not a fool . This is n't the price a man offers for a boat if he means to leave the money behind . You plan to kill me before you go . " " If I say I 'm buying , I 'm buying . " " You 've let me hear enough tonight that you dare n't let me live behind you . A girl traveling in disguise with a man who tosses steel about as if it were silver ? Her father recently dead , and them both afraid of the law ? Do you think we of the river have n't heard that Lord Peace died today ? And that the King looks for his daughter Patience , the rightful Heptarch , the daughter of prophecy ? You did n't care if I figured it out because you knew I 'd be dead . " Patience knew Sken was right  --  she knew Angel well enough for that . " I thought you were talking so openly because this woman was to be trusted , not because she was to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Angel . " What if I did mean to killyou ? Why should I change my mind now , and take you along ? " " Because I know the river and I 'm strong enough to row . " " We can hire a rower if we feel the need . " " Because you 're both decent folk who do n't kill people who do n't deserve it . " " We 're not that decent , " said Angel . " We leave justice up to the priests . " " You 'll take me along because she 's my rightful Heptarch , and I 'll serve her to the end of my life . I 'd die before I let any harm come to her . " The fervency of Sken 's speech was convincing . Schooled in guile , they knew naivete when they saw it . Sken had n't the art to lie to them even if she wanted to.  | " Well ? " asked Angel . Patience was willing . Sken 's loyalty appealed to her . It had n't occurredto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her identity revealed than she could ever have in disguise . " I almost cut off her head before . It 's the least we can do now . " " Until we have no more need of you , then , " said Angel . " And your parting wages will be a good deal better than death . " " What about these coins ? " " Keep them , " said Angel . " They 're an earnest of rewards to come . " It took only a few minutes to load the boat . They sang ribald songs together as they passed among the guardboats , and Sken roundly cursed the guards by name . They knew her well , and let her pass . They rounded a bend and passed into the forest , where the river ran cool and deep . Heptam was behind them , and they had begun the long road to Cranning.  |p77Patience  did not enjoy the river travel . Not that the water made her sick  --  she had crossed seawater often enough between King 's Hill and Lost Souls ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that contributed to her malaise . The death of her father , the loss of all that was familiar to her , and , on top of that , the ever-present Cranning call , urging her on ; she felt she had lost control of things , and it made her anxious . What made it worse was that she had genuine physical discomfort as well . Sken and Angel were frank enough about handling the eliminationof waste ; they hung over the gunnel and everyone discreetly looked away . But Patience had swallowed the scepter of the Heptarchs , and was n't about to let it vanish in the depths of the River Glad . So she could only relieve her bowel on land , and they did n't stop every day , or even every other day . And when they did , she took no pleasure in searching for the crystal . Many times she wished it had been smaller , or that she had n't swallowed it . Since no one searched her , it had n't been necessary after all , and now all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , and tucked it safely away , hoping she wouldp78never have to resort to her own alimentary system as a hiding place again . They left the Glad River at Wanwood , where it bent north and west . They bought a half-open carriage with four horses ; they would n't need to keep out the cold , only the rain . The roads alternated between ruts and mudholes , depending on the weather . On the worst roads , Sken climbed off the carriage and walked . " I thought you were well enough padded to withstand a little bouncing , " said Angel . " Padded ! This is all meat , and tender as veal today , after this pound-ing . " No doubt they seemed an odd family , if anyone on the road took them for father , mother , and son . Patience , still disguised as a boy , publicly referred to Angel and Sken as uncle and aunt , which annoyed them both . But on the highway , few people commented on oddities , not to their faces , anyway ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads were not as safe as the river , not for travelers without armed escort . They were careful to stop for the night well before dusk , and in every inn they stayed at , the three of them shared a room . More than once Angel had to persuade burglars to abandon their life of crime . Removing a few fingers usually did the trick . At last they reached Cranwater , the great river that flowed from Skyfoot in a single stream to the sea . They reached it at Waterkeep , an ancient castle that once marked the northest boundary of Korfu . Now the castle was in ruins and the city had shrunk to a fair-sized market town . Two dozen inns and taverns , what with the intersection of the river and the road . They chose an inn and stabled the horses . At supper , with bread and cheese and pea soup at the tavern table , and Sken 's mug filled with warm ale , Angel and Patience discussed their plans for the morning . " It 's time we left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , our highwaynorthward . " " The river 's narrow here , " said Sken . " The current 's strong . I 'd need two strong men to help me row against it . " Angel had already thought of that . " The prevailing wind in these latitudes at this time of year is from the west , and usually the south-west . "  | " You 're going to buy a windsucker ? " asked Sken . " Do you know how to pilot one ? " " I was wrapped in sailcloth the day I was born , " said Sken . " Long before I settled me on the river with my second husband , my family was a seafaring family . Left our stilts every spring with the floods and a cargo of such stuff as Heptam makes , then home again before summer with the earliest fruits from the islands . Never got rich , as I recall it , but we got drunk a lot . " " Then you know how to handle a sailing vessel . " " Never done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ca n't be done . Just have to do things faster , that 's all . Do n't buy too big a boat , that 's all . You 'd better let me choose it , too . " " Is that all ? " " That 's all . Are you two made of money ? " A dwelf stood by their table with a pitcher of ale . " More ? " he asked . " No , " said Angel . " Yes , " said Sken , glaring at him . " Are you two made of money ? " asked the dwelf . He had Sken 's intonation exactly . " Now look what you 've done , " said Angel . " We 'll have the dwelf repeating it all over the tavern . " " Repeat repeat , " said the dwelf . Then he giggled . Angel put a couple of coppers in his hand , turned him around , and pushed him toward the kitchen . " Sorry , " said Sken . " Even if dwelfs have no brains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Angel let his annoyance show . It could be intimidating , and Sken was silent . " Dwelfs are a puzzle , " said Patience . " They do have their own language . They must have some kind of brain , to hold a language . " Angel shrugged . " I never ponder the mental capacity of dwelfs . I just think of them as exceptionally stupid geblings . " " But they are n't geblings , are they ? " " Another indigenous species . Imakulata needed humans , whether the geblings and dwelfs and gaunts thought so or not . " The innkeeper came out of the kitchen carrying bread to another table . But when that job was done , he came over and pulled up a chair beside Angel.  | " Everything is excellent , " said Sken . She was beginning to be drunk . " Everything is perfect . More ale , please . " The innkeeper was not amused . " I do n't know where you people are from  --  probably Heptam , since you seem to think nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can harm us in Heptam , " said Angel . " There is n't a tavern in Waterkeep where you can safely show as much money as you 've shown , and talk as freely . I hope you are n't planning to travel from here by road . " " Should n't we ? " asked Angel . " Better hire a trustworthy guard . Preferably by arranging with the townmaster for some of the local police . Otherwise you wo n't get ten miles from here alive . " " What is the unbearable danger ? " " Robbers . " " Is that all ? " " All ? There 's plenty of trade through here , and not much protection . Officially we 're part of Pankos , but we have n't seen a royal officer in thirty years . So the townmaster makes the law in Waterkeep , and Tinker makes the law in the woods . " " Tinker ? " " He used to be a royal governor , or maybe just a royal governor 's son . They say he was caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . He lives in the forest north of here . They say he has a whole city of robbers living in treehouses . We call it Tinker 's Wood . " " Sounds like children playing , " said Angel . " If you go south or east or west they 'll stop you , and as long as you give them everything you own without a fight , they 'll usually let you keep your clothes and your lives . If you have enough money , even your horses and carriage . " " And if we go north ? " " Then take an army . A very large one . Or go by boat . Tinker figures anyone headed north by road has decided to die . And he believes that death can be a long and satisfying spectator sport . " " You 've convinced us , " said Angel . " And thank you for taking the risk of angering him , by warning us . " " Oh , he does n't mind if we warn people . There 's always plenty ofp81fools who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go where they like . " " I can go anywhere , " mumbled Sken . " I 'll cut em in half , every last bastard of em . " " Go by boat , " said the innkeeper . " And do n't go anywhere near shore for at least thirty miles upriver . It 's good advice . People who take it live to thank me . " The innkeeper went back to the kitchen . " Back to the water , " said Sken . " About time . " She lifted her mug to salute the others and sloshed ale on Angel . They enlisted the help of the four household dwelfs to get her to her room . On the dock the next morning they found a good many boats for hire , but not many for sale . " Does n't matter , " murmured Angel . " Any boat is for sale when the price is high enough . " " Our money is n't infinite , " said Patience . " We may want some next year . " " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she wanted to get to Cranning . Wanted to more than anything else in the world . The Cranning call was with her now as a constant hunger . As long as she was moving toward Cranning , it eased , and she felt satisfied . But when there were delays , like now , as they walked on the wooden wharf of the riverport , the need became quite intense . Today , though , she noticed a subtle change . It was n't just that she needed to get to Cranning . Now she felt a longing to be on the water , to travel up the river . The morning sunlight dancing on the water looked magical , the curve of the river enticed her . And it occurred to her that she had never felt such feelings before . She had n't particularly enjoyed the journey on the Glad River . Why should she long for waterborne travel now ? She thought of last night , when the innkeeper had come to them . Perhaps he advised everyone to avoid Tinker 's Wood , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some working arrangement with the local highwaymen , especially since they had no protection from a larger government . If the innkeeper was free to warn away travelers , then the robbers must not be very dangerous after all . And if the robbers were as dangerous as he had said , then how did he dare to tisk his life to warn a trio of rich and foolish strangers away from the load ?  |p82What  could it be but the Cranning call , prompting the innkeeper and now making her long to go by water . For some reason , Unwyrm  --  whoever he was  --  wanted her not to travel on the forest road . Was it simply to keep her safe ? Or was it because there was something in that forest , along that road , that she must not discover ? Am I not a trained killer ? And Angel ? Sken , too , looks like she could be dangerous enough . Even if the robbers are as vicious as the innkeeper said , we could probably get through . And if Unwyrm wants us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I will go . In the moment she made that decision , she felt an agony of regret . How could she even have thought of doing such a stupid thing ? Riskingthe lives of all three of them on some stupid whim . When the water looked so inviting , was so easy , just to sail upriverAnd now she knew , through the cloud of these passions , that Unwyrmwanted desperately for her to stay off the forest road . She also knew that regardless of the cost , she would travel by land . The gnawing hunger for Cranning and for the river only got worse , but had n't she been schooled all her life in putting off her ease ? Had n't she gone without sleep , without food , without water , in order to stretch her limits , to toughen her resistance ? She could ignore any of her body 's hungers , especially when she knew that it was an illusion sent into her mind by an enemy . Or was it an enemy ? It did n't matter . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular . She would go to Cranning , but she would take any route she pleased . She would not be controlled . " This one , " said Sken . The boat was small , compared to some of the sailing vessels , but it looked clean and sturdy . " All right , " said Angel . " No , " said Patience . Sken was annoyed . " What 's wrong with it ? " " Nothing . Except that I 'm not going by boat . " Angel drew her away from Sken . " Are you out of your mind ? " he whispered . " Probably . But I 'm not going by boat . I 'm taking our carriage through the forest road . " " It 's suicide . Did n't you hear the innkeeper ? " " I heard him very well . I also hear the Cranning call . He wants mep83to go by water . Wants it badly . I 'm going to find out what it is that he does n't want me to find in the forest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to find . " " Are you sure ? I think he 's a little too eager to get us off the road . This is n't the best place to begin a sailing voyage upriver  --  the current'stoo swift . Sken said so herself , did n't she ? " " It 's better than dying . " " Since when have you been afraid of a few highwaymen , Angel ? " " Since I thought of dozens of them dropping out of trees onto our heads . I 'm trained to kill unsuspecting people in subtle ways , not fight with a bunch of unmannered thieves . " " You have n't met them . You know nothing about their manners . " " Did it occur to you that maybe this is just what Unwyrm wants you to do ? Maybe the creature knows that you 're stubborn and rebellious . Maybe it wants you to go into the forest , and figured this was the way . " " A little far-fetched , Angel . " " Maybe it wants the robbers to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as confessing that he feared for his own life . The Cranning call resonated with his words . The feelings welled up in her . How can you endanger them ? What kind of person are you ? Selfish , arrogant . Go by water , for their sake . But the more the Cranning call pressed her , the more she resisted . " Go by boat , then . I 'll meet you in the first riverport village upstream . I can handle the carriage alone . You can even take all the money  --  I trust you . " " No , " said Angel . His hands were trembling . " No , I wo n't leave you . " He really is afraid , thought Patience . Almost she decided to give in , for Angel 's sake . But the moment she thought that , the Cranning call redoubled its force , as if her thought of yielding had opened a floodgate . She winced from the pain of it . Then the longing subsided , as if it had taken a great effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thought Patience . Wear yourself out with trying . I did n't go without comfort all that time in my childhood just to give in and take the easy way now . " Good . We go by land . " Sken was no happier than Angel had been.  | " You do n't have to come with me , " Patience said . " You 've served me well and earned your passage home . " " We need all the help we can get , " Angel said . " I 'll double your payment , if you come with us . " Sken looked at him with contempt . " I 'll come because of who she is , not what you offer . " Angel smiled . Patience knew perfectly well that Angel had expected Sken to react that way . The art of diplomacy , as Father had always said : to provoke your opponent into wanting to do what you planned . Angel was a diplomat . Unwyrm was n't . Unwyrm was very blunt about what he wanted , and Patience was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ byplay in this battle . They left the dock and went to the stable . Their horses had been well groomed  --  Angel had paid for the service , since he was expecting to sell them . Patience prepared her blowgun with three dozen wooden darts . They were more visible than her glass darts , but they flew farther and carried as lethal a dose of poison . Angel grumbled about being an old man as he took a shortbow and a packet of arrows from his trunk . " I 'm not very good with this , " he said . " I 'm better with knifework in close . " " From behind , too , no doubt , " said Sken . " I can poison them all , too , " said Angel . " Provided they invite us to supper . " " Poison and a knife in the back . What a man . " " Enough , " said Patience . " This will be dangerous enough without a stupid quarrel over nothing . " She spoke sharply , letting her voice carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflicting on her . Just climbing into the carriage made her feel ill ; she was trembling and nauseated as Angel snapped the reins to start the horses out onto the cobbled lane . The stones were ancient and worn even and flat by years of traffic , but Patience felt the tiny breaks betweenthem like ruts that jarred her until her head ached . But she had learned all her lessons well . She kept her demeanor calm , managing to look slightly amused at moments that were far from amusing . She would not break under Unwyrm 's twisting grip . She would not let Angel see that she suffered . If she could fool Angel , she knew she was still in control of herself . The town was not very big , and soon the highway passed betweenp85fields of vegetables and orchards , where farmers hoed or harvested among the ruins of old mansions that had once been the pride of Waterkeep . It was part of the cycle of things , in the years of human life on Imakulata . Waterkeep had once been great ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely , but nothing stayed . Even the religions had their changing fashions , the Keepers and the Brickmakers , the Rememberers and the Watchers , and , only in the last century , the Vigilants in their little hermit huts . They would also fall to ruin . Nothing lasted . Except the bloodline of the Heptarchy , which had gone on unbroken , the only institution that endured through all the millennia of mankind on Imakulata . It was a thing unknown in human history . She tried to remember anything comparable . The Romans were only a thousand years by the most generous count ; the Popes only lasted some 2500 years . Even the patriarchate of Constantinoplewas gone now , though it had lasted long enough in a perverse and polluted form to send this colony to Imakulata . The colonists on Imakulata were supposed to keep Greek religion alive , though none of them spoke Greek or cared much , in the end , about maintainingthe forms of the old Greek church . Nothing lasted except the l leptarchy . Until now , thought Patience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears at me . It is the end of the Heptarchy if he conquers inc . And if I keep resisting him , it is the end of me . Orchards began to give way to stands of wood . Here and there a tiny village interrupted the growing forest , with a few cows on the commons , a few farmers in the fields , and children who shouted at the carriage and ran alongside until they could n't keep up any longer . Sken cursed them loudly , which delighted them , and Patience pretended to cnjoy it , though she was beyond anything but the imitation of pleasure now . Angel , however , stayed glum , urging the horses on at a brisk pace . Finally , in early afternoon , the trees won out entirely , as the road become closed in with thick underbrush and old giants ten or twenty dieters round . It was a perfect place for ambuscade , and Patience felt a new wave of shame at having led them into such danger . They came to a long straight lane through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the lane they could plainly see a thick ropep86stretched across the road , at such a height that it would catch the horses ' necks . " Brazen , are n't they ? " said Sken . " They give us plenty of time to see what 's coming . " " I 'm turning around , " said Angel . At his words Patience felt grateful assent well up within her . But she had learned discipline . And her resistance to Unwyrm had become a madness in her now , as the pain of it became greater . " Go back if you want , " she said . " I 'm going on . " She had her glass blowgun in the cross beneath her shirt ; it and the loop were her weapons of last resort if she were captured . She carried a longer , more accurate wooden blowgun . The darts , all heavily poisoned , were in a pouch . She could handle them safely enough ; her father had seen to it she was inured to the most useful poisons before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carriage and strode out boldly toward the waiting rope . Sken cursed , but followed her with a hatchet in each hand . And Angel grimly brought the carriage along after . " They can kill us whenever they want , " he said . " Watch the trees , " said Patience . " The innkeeper said they liked torturing people . They 'll try to take us alive . " " Now I feel better , " said Sken . " The rope is yours , " said Patience . " It 's as good as down . " Patience scanned the underbrush , the trees overhead . The leaves were sparse enough to allow plenty of light ; there was a slight breeze , too , which concealed any signs of movement by the robbers . Patience saw only a couple of men high in the branches . Bowmen , no doubt . But it was not an easy thing to aim a bow to shoot almost straight down at a moving target ; if the archers in the trees hit any of them , it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men on the ground , no doubt dozens of them hiding behind trees . They could swarm out from any direction . She slipped a dart into the blowgun and held three in her right hand . They were still a few meters from the rope when four men stepped out from behind a tree and stood in the middle of the road , behind the rope . They swaggered , they smiled , they knew their victims had no chance . One stepped forward , preparing to speak . Patience knew thatp87as he talked , others would come out and surround them . So there would be no talk . She blew a puff through the pipe . She had aimed for the throat , but the dart went high and entered his mouth . He stood , transfixed , the dart invisible to his companions behind him . So she had time to load again and shook before they realized what was happening . The second dart struck its victim in the forehead ; the first man finally gagged and choked and fell over , writhing from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men backed away , surprisedfor a moment that the initiative had been taken from them . Sken moved slowly , but with great momentum , and one blow with her hatchet split the rope . Immediately Angel urged the horses forward , Sken swung up onto the carriage , and Patience jogged alongside , then caught hold . The carriage bounced over the bodies in the road . She heard a voice in the underbrush saying , " The boy got Tinker . With his mouth . " For a moment it seemed they might be allowed to pass . Then the men began to shout , to scream , and arrows began striking the carriage from behind . Angel urged the horses on , shouted at them , and then suddenly gurgled and choked . An arrow stuck out of the side of his neck . Many hands clutched at the horses ; the carriage came to a stop . Patience had no time to worry about Angel . Fortunately the robbers wasted time cutting the horses loose . Patience ignored the horses and shouted for Sken to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage , swinging her hatchets and spattering blood in every direction . They backed off from Sken , perhaps hoping an archer would take care of her , but Patience kept blowing darts with deadly aim  --  at this range , she could hardly miss  --  and those who were n't killed outright screamed in such agony at the poison that the robbers began to lose heart . After all , their commander had been killed , they had already lost a dozen men , with some vicious injuries from the hatchets , and every dart that hit home meant another death . They cried out terrible threats and oaths , but broke and ran as the darts kept coming . Sken had a deep cut in the back of one arm . " I 'm all right , " she said . " We 've got to get out of here . They 'll be back , they 'll follow us , we 've got to keep moving . " " Can you pull the carriage ? " " Better to run , what good will all your money do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still alive . The only way to bring him is in the carriage . " Sken looked at the arrow in his throat , grunted , then took her place at the front of the carriage . " Just keep a good lookout , " she said . Angel 's wound was n't bleeding much , and Patience knew to leave the shaft in place until they had time to try surgery . Unless they could find a good-sized town with an expert physician , though , there was n't much hope for him . She should go back , hurry back to Waterkeep , where there would be a physician . And they could continue their trip by water , after Angel was better . But she recognized this thought , too , as coming from Unwyrm . Or did she ? Maybe it was common sense , maybe what she was doing with this determination to resist was killing Angel . How could she push on , not even knowing if there was a village ahead , when this loyal man , her teacher , virtually the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carriage ? On . She held that single thought in her head , go on . Go on . She scanned the road ahead and behind , watching for robbers or for one of the horses . Once a man stepped into the road behind them , armed with a bow ; he died before he could get off a shot . There were no others . Perhaps they had given up . It did n't matter . For Angel 's sake there could be no slackening of the pace . She tried to join Sken in pulling the carriage . " Go away , " said the woman . " You break up my rhythm . Keep watching . " And finally the trees thinned , and there was an orchard , and after the orchard , a field ; villagers shouted to each other and began to gather . " Tinker let you through ? " asked a child . " Have you a healer ! " called Sken . " Not a village healer , " Patience said . " They sometimes know more than the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one , so much the better for the old man . " " We have a healer , " said a man . " A gebling . But a fine healer all the same . " " Can you pull this carriage ? " asked Sken . " Can you pull this to the healer ? We can pay . " " Tinker left you with money ? " Patience was tired of hearing his name . " Tinker 's dead , " she said . " Take us to the healer . "  | " The boy 's a pretty one , " said one of the girls , a snaggle-toothed wretch who was trying to flirt . Patience sighed and climbed onto the carriage . Angel 's eyes were open now . She held his hand to ease the fear he no doubt felt . " We 're with friends , " she said . The villagers took hold of the carriage leads , and some pushed from behind . Sken gratefully climbed aboard . A strange feeling came over Patience as soon as the carriage started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the resistance from Unwyrm was gone . And now the Cranning call was back again , a yearning to go on , to go north , to Cranning . Where her lover waited for her , with gentleness and tender kisses , her lover waited to fill her womb with life . Patience forced these new feelings into the background , just as she had done with the old , more vicious ones . Unwyrm now wants to hurry me on . So apparently I 'm right where he did n't want me to be . Heading for a gebling healer in a village hidden from the world by a band of robbers . Unwyrm could n't have guided her here more surely if he had given her a map . Have I done , after all , what my enemy wanted ? Or have I defeated him ? " There , " cried some of the villagers . It was a good-sized house at the far end of town . " He lives there with his sister , " said a villager . " And a human , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , " said another . " Filthy beasts . " " But he 's a healer , a true healer . " " What is his name ? " asked Patience . " Ruin , " said a man . Sken snorted . " That 's a promising name . " Smoke curled from the chimney . Pass it by , said the Cranning call . I lurry on . Angel will be safe . Go on , pass it by , pass it by . The door opened and a gebling woman emerged , covered with fur . She was clean , not filthy at all , beautiful by gebling standards . There was an intelligence in her eyes that made Patience decided to be wary with her . No sense in letting her know that she could speak Geblic . This house was important enough that Unwyrm did n't want her there . So she would enter it as an ambassador , and learn all she could before committing herself to anything . And in the meantime , she hoped against all likelihood that Angelp90could be saved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried him in . Patience thought of scattering copper coins for them , but instead took a steel coin and handed it to the old man who seemed to be the village headman . " For the whole village , for your kindness to us . " The old man smiled and nodded , and people murmured their thanks . It was more money than the whole village earned in a year.  |p91Reck  heard the villagers coming when they were still well away from her little house . There was an excitement in the murmur that the wind brought . She cocked her head to hear better . Could it be a gobbing ? No , there was no anger in it . This was n't a village that was given to letting the priests stir them up against the geblings . Which was not to say that it was n't always a possibility . One never knew when humans would get religion and start killing . But why the excitement , if they were coming for a healing ? Someoneimportant needed physicking , then , someone unusual or powerful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or powerful had ever lived anywhere near Waterside Village  --  one of a hundred villages by that name along the shores of Cranwater alone . The stranger must also be injured , not sick , for disease never drew a crowd for long . Fear of contagion . Reck went to the door and called to Will . He was in the field , hoeing out the potatoes . He heard her , waved , tossed the hoe onto the sledge and pulled the heavy burden along the ground toward the barn . He was a tall man , a giant even by human standards ; to a gebling hep92was almost double size . He had once been an owned soldier , a slave in the service of a general officer in one army or another . He was an accomplished killer , and stronger than any other man Reck had heard of . But Reck had no fear of him . She had found him as a runaway slave many years ago and offered him protection and a place to farm . It was enough for him . He and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to the other , because neither had much to say . Both did their work dependably and well , and took pleasure in the labor . Still , they were wise enough to be discreet . After all these years it was no secret in the village that there was a giant man living with the geblings near the forest 's edge . But they did n't enrage the villagers by flaunting it , just kept Will out of sight when people brought their sick and injured to be healed . It was not a problem with them . Will got the sledge in the barn and no doubt climbed into the loft to sleep until the people went away . Will had a remarkable ability to sleep whenever he wanted , for as long as he wanted . Reck often wondered if Will was ever haunted by the dreams that kept her sleepless so many nights . She wondered , but did not ask . Dreams were not a subject that a gracious gebling asked about . She saw the people drawing a carriage toward her house . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen afoul of the robbers  --  Tinker 's men , no doubt . That was no surprise . The surprise was that anyone came out of it alive . Tinker was usually more careful . She sniffed the air . Blood , but no bowel smell . Perhaps only a superficialwound , something she could clean and bind up without waiting for her brother to come home . There was a young boy in the carriage , sitting up and conversing with the villagers . He seemed to be in charge of things . An old man lay with his head in the boy 's lap . A coarse-looking fat woman rode in the driver 's seat , calling to the villagers who drew the carriage , urging them on with curses and promises and taunts . It was the old man who was injured , then . Only the one ? And a young boy like that  --  Tinker always had his eye out for a catamite . Something strange had passed in the forest . Unlikely that Tinker was alive , with an outcome such as this . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at first . That was all right ; Reck understood that . She , too , was more formidable than she seemed.  |p93She  met them at the gate . " Carry the man in , if he ca n't walk , " she said . " Leave the carriage there , and the rest of you go home . " " They killed Tinker , " one of the villagers said . " And half his men . " The fat woman was feeling boastful . " I killed half of em myself , and you can trust there was a mark or two on every one ! " Could be bluster , but no . Reck saw bloodstains halfway up her arms . Some of the blood was her own . " You can wash in the basin outside here . Get that wound clean . " The fat woman washed as the villagers brought in the old man and laid him on the physicking table . The boy and the fat woman came in to watch ; Reck paid no attention to them . The man had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had passed behind the windpipe , so he had pain but no blood in his breath . Blood was still welling slowly from the base of the wound . Reck leaned down and sniffed it , then put forth her long tongue to lick it . She heard the fat woman grunt in revulsion . The boy said nothing . There 's something wrong with the boy , thought Reck . But she could n't place it . More important was the taste of the old man 's blood . " Poison , " Reck told them . " A nasty one . This wound wo n't heal . The blood wo n't stop flowing . " " Then we do n't take the arrow out ? " asked the fat woman . " You were right to leave it in . " " What will you do ? " asked the boy . " Nothing . " Reck turned to the villagers . " Go away , I told you . You 've done all you can ! " " You 'll do nothing ! " said the boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thank you . " The boy spoke in a voice that said that he expected to be obeyed . Hum , the blacksmith 's boy , answered on the way out the door . " Oh , this one 's the girl goblin . It 's the brother that 's the healer . " " A girl ! " cried the fat woman . " How can you tell , with goblins ? " " When you see the brother , you 'll know . He 's got him a tine this long . Never wears nothing but his fur . " Reck was used to the way humans ridiculed geblings to their faces . If geblings had been larger than two-thirds the average human height , they might have refused to bear it . But as long as geblings wanted to live away from Cranning , out in the world of men , they had to accom/modate the empty-minded cruelty of humans . Her brother , Ruin , had a harder time bearing it than most . He lived in the woods most of the time , to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , as if to say that he 'd rather be the animal they thought he was than pretend to be like them . " When will your brother come back ? " asked the boy . Reck did n't answer the question . Instead she studied the boy 's face , then sniffed the air again . That 's what was wrong . The boy had no ridge of bone above the eyes , like most human males . And there was the smell of menstrual blood on him ; the living blood from the old man 's wound had masked it . But there was no lying to Reck 's nose . The door closed behind the last of the villagers . " I said , when will your brother come back ? " " First , " said Reck , " tell me who you are , and why you 're pretending to be a boy . " Suddenly she felt a strong hand gripping her wrist , twisting her around . It was the old man . She had thought him unconscious , but now he held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have hit him in the groin and made him let go , but she saw no reason to add to the pain he already had . " You can fool humans , " she said , " but not a gebling with half a brain . What the eye ca n't see , the nose can smell . " " Let her go , " the girl said . " It 's my time of month , remember ? I forgot that geblings could smell it . It 's a gift I wish I had . " The old man 's grip relaxed . Reck did not move until he pulled his hand away . " The old man 's name is Angel . He 's my tutor and my friend . This magnificent woman is Sken . She included herself with the purchase price when we bought her boat to leave Heptam . " The girl smiled . " I was going to tell you my name was Adam , but now that you know my sex , I wo n't tell you my name at all . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbed you ? " " Tinker did n't rob us . He only proposed to rob us . His men ran our horses off , but we gave them more than they expected . We thought to buy more horses here . But it seems no one has horses to sell . " " The army takes them , " Reck said . " To humans , they leave one horse for farming . Geblings get no horse at all . " " I do n't want your horse . I just want Angel healed . "  | " My brother is coming . " " You have n't even sent for him . " " I do n't have to send for him . He knows the animals of the forest . They see all that happens here , and tell him . " The girl looked over at Sken , as if to say , What kind of superstitious nonsense have we got caught up in here ? The old man murmured , " We are n't villagers . We know that geblingscan call each other . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's the animals of the forest , " Reck said . " But I learned long ago never to argue with a man who thinks he 's a scientist . " " I 'm a philosopher . This arrow in my throat hurts like bloody hell . " " I 'm sorry . My brother may be far away . He may be a while in coming . There 's nothing we can do . " " I 'm thirsty . " " The arrow may pass right through your swallowing throat . " " It does . " " Then you do n't get a drink , either . " The girl and Sken both sat , then , the girl on a stool and Sken on the floor , leaning against the wall . Reck went back to her work , feathering the arrows she had made yesterday . It was a fine and tedious job , made no easier by the labored , painful breathing of the man on the table . Will came in soon after , carrying water . He did not look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table . He set one bucket of water by the fire , and poured the other into a large jar by the table . Only then did he face the visitors . " Will , " he said , introducing himself . " Sken , " said the fat woman . The girl said nothing . " You live here ? " asked Sken . Will nodded . Sken looked from him to Reck and back again . " Abomination , " she said . Will grinned . " I 'm her slave , " he said . Sken relaxed a little . " It 's foul for a gebling to own a man , but as long as she does n't get the pony ride  --  " " I 'd say it 's none of your business , " said Reck , " and that you have a strange way of talking when you want this man to live . " " I speak my mind , " said Sken.  | " Then your mind is manure , " said Reck . Sken took only one step toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to stop . Will cried out also , but to Reck . Despite the cries , however , it was no sound that stopped Sken . It was the sight of Reck with her bow already in place . Only a moment , and she was ready to put an arrow wherever she wanted . " No , Reck , " said Will . " They come as beggars to my door , and then accuse me of letting a human mount me . Though if any human ever tried , you 're the only one that might live through it . " Angel spoke weakly from the table . " Forgive this woman . She was raised on the river , and never learned to speak civilly to anyone . " Reck let the bow relax . Sken tugged at the neck of her dress and sat back down , looking into the fire . Goblin-baiting had never brought her so close to death before . The gebling merchants that bought river passagein Heptam were meek and never answered back . This was n't the first time Sken had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked . But she never liked it . Will set about making supper , and Reck resumed her fletchery . Angel breathed ever more shallowly . The girl sat silent in the corner . They remained that way , wordless and wary , until dusk , when Ruin came home.  |p97Ruin  felt the pressure of Unwyrm 's hatred like a wind in his face . He fairly leaned into it , and grimaced at the pain of moving on . Had there been anyone to see him , he would have looked ridiculous , a naked , filthy , ungroomed gebling struggling to move through flat and grassy meadows in bright sunlight , torturing himself to stagger between trees whose branches easily bent out of his way . But always , whenever Ruin set his face toward Cranning , there was a hurricane of resistance . He was the only gebling of all geblings who could not go home . It was after two grueling days of this  --  pushing forward , stopping to rest , pressing on again  --  that he felt Reck 's call to him . That loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spine  --  Ruin had never told her how her call affected him ; no other gebling had such power over him . Especially now , after days of Unwyrm 's shout of rage : The whisper from Reck was unbearable . Ruin stumbled to his knees and wept . Wept in anger  --  furious at Reck for calling him , furious at himself for not having the strength to ignore her call and fight on . But he could not fight on . And after he lay in the grass by the stream for a few minutes or an hour , he crawled to the water and drank , then arose . For a moment he faced Cranningward ; but the thought of an/other step in that direction was more than he could bear . He turned and went the other way . His feet were light under him . He loped through the woods and meadows , covering in minutes the ground that he had struggled through for hours . All the while his sister was like a song in his mind , comforting him , calling him back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no gebling alive who could call any of their humanlike houses " home . " There was only one home for geblings : The great city in the cliff , the mapless tunnels and delvings that reached a mile deep from the face of Skyfoot . Cranning , a city with more inhabitants than most nations , peopled with men and dwelfs and gaunts but ruled by geblings , for only geblings held within their minds the indelible , unwritable memory of every turn of every tunnel in the place . Every stone in every cavern was familiar , even to geblings like Ruin , who had never set his foot on the stone , never tasted the cold water that flowed through the tunnels from the glacier above , never slept under the arch of darkness that was infinitely more comforting than the sky . Where Reck was , Ruin could be at peace ; but outside Cranning , he could never be at home . And while Unwyrm lived , how could Ruin ever get there ? It was the quandary of his life , ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what he had to do . " You are the most excellentof excellent blood , you and your sister , with the seeds of mastery in your souls . There is nothing you can not learn , nothing you can not do , no thought that can not come into your mind like light out of the storm . You were born to be the best answer of the geblings to the terrible hatred of Unwyrm , our only hope to slay him , the two of you . " " Where do I find him ? " asked the child Ruin . " He lives at the heart of Cranning , where the lifeblood flows . He lives in the very womb of the geblings , the viper in our womb , to devour our babies as they are born . " " Then teach me the way to Cranning , Mother , so I can go and kill him ! " Then Mother wept , her long tongue hanging dejectedly from her mouth , its twin points glistening with her tears . " How can you , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ruin and Reck , my son , my daughter , we made you to be the downfall of our enemy , but already he knows you and hides Cranning from you in your own mind . " When Mother died , Ruin and Reck wandered aimlessly in the worldp99for a time . Each of them at once rejected and prepared for the work their mother had taught them they must do . Reck learned the arts of archery and could kill anything that she could see  --  but she refused to search for Cranning , denying that the place meant anything to her . She mocked Ruin for his endless effort to reach the place . " All dreams and visions , " she said , " all foolish prophecies . " But still she practiced with the bow in all her spare hours , and studied all the lore of Unwyrm that she could find among the geblings who traveled the river and came to take the hospitality of her house . Ruin , in turn , would not become a killer . Instead he learned the arts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herbs that grew there , using them to heal the sick and broken animals , the wounds caused by men and other beasts . When an herb was promising , he grew and nurtured it , taught it more of what he wanted it to do , and soon he had herbs that could drive away infections , root powders that could cure disease , berries that took away all pain . And he knew the inward shape of every body just by looking at its outward lines . The lizard and the lyon , the rubin and the grouse , he knew them , could cut them open and set them to rights . He could never have set his knowledge down in books , like humans did . Poor humans  --  they lacked the othermind , the secret memory in which geblings hid their great learning even from themselves . If you asked Ruin what was wrong with one of his many patients , he could not tell you , for his manmind , his wordmind  --  it knew nothing of healing . His wordmind could only speak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use for it . It was his othermind that he trusted , his othermind that he let rule him , and his othermind that held all his greatest gifts . Except it was also his othermind that Unwyrm had found and forced away from Cranning . Only his weak and hated manmind could drive him forward , again and again , struggling for control of his legs and arms , in the endless vertical climb to meet his enemy . And when I meet him , what will I do ? What am I fit for , except to be the first of my people to be devoured ? It was near nightfall and Ruin was bitter with failure when he reached the house he shared with Reck . He knew from the smell that there were humans inside , knew also that it was the old man who was injured and the young woman who most loved and feared for him . The fat woman was just a pile of sweat ; he disregarded her . There wasp100also the smell of Will , but Ruin disregarded him , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ox , that was her prerogative . Ruin never spoke to Will , and Will returned the favor . Reck greeted him without a touch or a smile . There had been anger here . Ruin questioned her in Geblic . " Why do you let them stay , if they offend you ? " " The girl , " said Reck . " Tell me you ca n't feel it , what she does to Unwyrm , being here . " Ruin strode to the boy-dressed girl , sitting on the floor in the corner . Yes , he could feel it too , like prickles on his spine . Near her , Unwyrm was not driving them away at all . He was calling . It was something Ruin had never felt before , though he had heard of it : the Cranning call . It was unbelievably strong , like the promise of sexual pleasure , like a mother 's love for a child . Ruin knelt and put his face close to the girl 's face . He ignored her revulsion , ignored the hand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from by the fire . " Keep that filthy beast away from her or I 'll kill him myself ! " " Quiet , " murmured the girl . " He has more to fear from me than I from him . " Ruin felt her breath on his cheek , and it seemed to be a warm breeze from Cranning , which called him now for the first time in his life . " A naked gebling coming at a girl like that , " grumbled the reeking old dunghill . " Time was when goblins knew their place . " Reck called him back to duty . " The fat woman who loves geblings is Sken . The man who is dying is Angel . " Ruin pulled himself away from the girl . It was almost a physical pain , when the Cranning call receded . Standing well away from her , though , it still had power over him , for the constant pressure of Unwyrm'shate was slackened . Ruin had never realized how much of his othermind Unwyrm had been using up . Now as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly and clearly that he could almost  --  not quite , but almost  --  bring it into his wordmind and explain it to himself . For the first time he realized what he might become if Unwyrm were dead . Angel was unconscious . It meant Ruin would not have to waste time drugging him to sleep . He tasted the wound , which was still oozing blood . He knew the poison  --  one of the childish weeds that the wood/land robbers were so proud of . It was the arrow itself that worried Ruin more . It had done some tearing on the way in and would do more coming out . The man 's eating throat would not heal well , and he might starve to death before he could swallow again . " I 'll have to cut him , " said Ruin , again in Geblic . " To let him heal inside . You tell the humans . " He knew enough Agarant to make himselfunderstood , but it was easier to let Reck deal with the humans . He much preferred communicating with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the others what Ruin would do , he found the fungus spores that would undo the poison , chose a thin brass knife from his toolbox , and gently drew a long , fine strand from the wireweedin the window planter . There had been no metal in the soil , so it was all organic , and would eventually dissolve inside the body . He put the blade and the wireweed in his mouth with a sprig of claffroot , to sterilize them . Then , in a swift motion , he cut deeply in the man 's throat , above and below the arrow . Ruin dipped his tongue in the fungus spores and then inserted his tongue in the incisions , deep within the wound , where the arrow 's poison still prevented the clotting of blood . It would take only a few minutes for the spores to do their work , feeding on the poison and then producing their own bloodbinder to help in the clotting of the blood . While he waited , he talked to Reck  --  in Geblic , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  who is she , and why is Unwyrmcalling her ? " " How should I know ? " asked Reck . " You 're the one who knows all the wyrmlore . She 's too young to be one of the Wise . " " Maybe she 's wise beyond her years . I think she 's more dangerous than she looks . She is n't afraid of anything . She said nothing of it , but I think she 's the one who killed most of Tinker 's men . " " With her bare hands ? " " You know the human woman that Unwyrm wants . The Vigilants tell everyone the prophecy of the seventh seventh seventh daughter  --  " " I pay no attention to humans , least of all to their religions . " " The seventh seventh seventh daughter was born fifteen years ago , to the deposed Heptarch of Korfu , which claims to rule the world . She could be of that age . "  | " It 's too much to believe that of all the ways to Cranning , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done their work ; the bleeding stopped . Ruin took hold of the arrowshaft and jerked it out . The man cried out in his sleep . More blood flowed , but again the spores sealed off the wound . Ruin hooked his finger around the tattered esophagus and pulled it to where he could see it . Then he deftly made vertical cuts , removing the torn edges . While he sewed the wounds with the wireweed , he spoke to Reck in Geblic . " It does n't matter if she 's the one or not , though , does it ? She wo n't go to Cranning without us . " " I have no interest in Cranning , " said Reck . " You 're as much in this as I am , " said Ruin . " He presses you away as much as me . " " Except I do n't try to go there , so it does n't hurt me . You should n't try either , Ruin . Why do you think our family has stayed in exile all these generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time ? " " But he wants us to stay away . That changes everything . Every other time , he wanted the king to be there with him . " " So we go just because he does n't want us to ? Then he controls us as surely as he ever did . " " Every other time , Sister , he wanted to use the geblings to destroy whatever it was the humans had been building . He has n't the strength to compel us all , but he compelled the king , and the king called the others to the common task . This time , though , it 's all different . He does n't plan to have the geblings act together . Perhaps he plans for us not to act together . And that 's why we have to go . " " Give up the governing purpose of our ancestors , on a guess ? " " The ancestor who first made this plan had been in Unwyrm 's control . That 's why he decided on exile . But how can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide ? " " There 's no way out of that circle , Brother . Who knows if anything we do will play into his hands ? " " You see ? So we decide for other reasons . And here is one : without Unwyrm 's breath in my face , Sister , I can finally breathe . Whether Unwyrm means it that way or not , she can take us through to him . " " Until the moment he stops calling her . " " It all depends on whether he wants her more than he fears us . " " So you believe she 's the one . "  | " Maybe fortune smiles on us . " Ruin finished with the esophagus and put it back in place . " Tell her that his throat will heal in a few days . It 'll be tighter than it was . He 'll have to chew his food . " Reck turned and , in Agarant , gave the news to the others . Ruin was still sewing up the outside wound , this time using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Does it make a difference to you whether the girl knows our plans or not ? " " How would she know ? " asked Ruin , tying off the thread . " Because I just discovered that she understands Geblic . " Ruin turned and looked at the girl . Her face was blank . " What makes you think so ? " " Because she was already relieved about Angel before I told her he would be all right . And then she pretended to be relieved again after I told her . But her sweat was all wrong . " Ruin grinned at the girl , letting his tongue hang out a little . He knew how the slender forked tongue of a gebling unnerved human beings , though in fact she showed no sign that it bothered her . He spoke to her in Geblic . " Never try to deceive a gebling , human . You 're the true Heptarch 's daughter , are n't you ? " The girl answered as smoothly and easily as if they had been conversingall day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the awkwardness humans often had in trying to form sounds with their blunt and stubby tongues . " No , sir . I am the Heptarch . " So her father was dead . Ruin felt no sympathy for the death of a human . Humans put on a good show of grieving , but they did n't really understand the bonding of a true family . They had no othermind , and could speak only in words . They remained strangers from each other all their lives . What was the life of a creature like this ? So he offered no commiseration . " You know the payment that I want for your friend 's life . " " He 's my slave , not my friend , " she said . " You 'll take me with you . You 'll make no effort to go without me . " " Maybe I 'm not going where you think I 'm going . " " You 're going to Cranning to destroy my people , and I 'm going to save them . " " Then why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of trou-ble ? " " He wants you , but if I killed you he might make do with someonep104else . At least we know who and where you are . So when Unwyrm brings you to his nest , we 'll be there , too . I think that means that we 're friends . " He smiled at her and let the tips of his tongue show . Reck stood by the stewpot , the tasting spoon in hand . " Why do you keep saying we , when I have no intention of going ? " Ruin did not look at her . " Because you 'd never let me face Unwyrm alone . " Reck shrugged . " Will 's stew is ready . " Ruin leaned closer to the Heptarch . Though she was sitting and he was standing up , he did not have to bend far for their eyes to meet . " Will you give me your word ? In payment for your slave 's life ? " " You have my word , but not in payment for anything . Angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word is my own to give . " Ruin nodded solemnly . " Then come join us at table . " Reck laughed aloud . " It was worth all this trouble just to see this moment  --  you , Ruin , inviting a human to eat with you . " " But she 's not a human , is she , Reck ? She 's Unwyrm 's woman and the mother of death . " " I am no one 's woman , " said the girl . " And my name is Patience . " It was Ruin 's turn to laugh . " Patience , " he said in Agarant . " Come and eat , Patience . " The table was designed for the comfort of geblings . It was too low for Patience to sit on a chair , so she sat on the floor . She was the only human at the table . When Sken took a step toward them , Ruin 's look was enough to drive her back to her stool near the fire . Will made no effort to sit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ruin noticed that Patience observed all the proper forms of respect . She had been well enough taught that it seemed as natural to her as to a gebling , to offer every few bites from her dish to him or to Reck , and to nibble at the bites they offered her . On those rare occasions when humans were invited to share a gebling meal , they usually showed what a great effort and sacrifice it took to eat from a gebling spoon . But Patience showed nothing but deference and grace . Unwyrm 's woman should be loathsome , not gracious , thought Ruin . But it makes no difference . Before all this is over , I 'll probably have to kill her after all . What 's the death of a human , if it might save my people ? When the food was finished off , they drank hot water from the pot by the fire . Ruin offered to take them through the forest , but Patiencep105would have none of it . " I take my people with me , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take him in the carriage . If we can find horses to buy . " Reck shrugged . " Buy ? Ruin can find your horses tomorrow . He can find anything in the woods . " " Not to pull the carriage , though , " he said . " We 'd spend all our time dragging it out of mudholes . We 'll go to the next human town and sell it and by a boat . The wind is out of the west , and Cranwater is wide and flat . The roads are the worst way to Cranning . " So it was agreed . The only argument came later , in the darkness , when Ruin lay beside his sister and she told him she meant to bring Will along . " What is he to you ? " asked Ruin for the thousandth time . " Is he your lover , now ? Do you want to bear his little monsters ? " She never answered such accusations . She only said , " He is my friend , and if I go , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . We 'd better buy a large boat . There are too many of us already . And too many humans altogether . " Then he fell to making obscene suggestions about what Will and Reck did whenever Ruin was away . She did n't answer , and he only stopped when her breathing told him that she had fallen asleep . It was hardly worth trying to make her angry anymore.  |p106They  were not the happiest party ever to set out for Cranning . Angel was too weak from hunger and loss of blood to do more than endure the jolting of the road . Though he could , painfully , drink milk from the farmhouses they passed , it would take time for him to come back up to strength , and even when he was conscious , he listened to the conversations of the others and almost never tried to speak . When they stopped at inns along the way , Patience fed him gruel in his room while the others ate at the common table . And the geblings slept in his room through the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he clawed at the pain in his throat . If Angel was silent , then Sken seemed never to stop speaking . She grumbled about everything that went wrong , and though she never said a word to or about the geblings if she could help it , she made it plain that she loathed them . She had a way of sniffing the air when Ruin was near . And whenever Patience and the geblings spoke " that jabbering noise , " she grew sullen and threw nutshells at the horses ' backs with particular vehemence . Not Sken 's surliness , not even Angel 's misery ever engaged Pa/tience 's attention for long , however . She was caught up in other concerns . The Cranning call grew stronger in her every day , often distractingher from whatever she was doing or thinking . And the call was changing form as well . It was no longer just an urgency in her mind . Now it was a hunger in her body . Night , in an inn not far from the river Cranwater . She dreamed a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " whispered Sken . Sken was shaking her . It was still dark . Was there some danger ? Patience reached for the loop in her hair . " No ! " Sken tried to push her back down onto her mat . Sken 's push , the physical restraint , gave Patience a new fear , that Sken herself meant her harm . Patience was trained to protect herself against just such an attempt at murder in the night . For a moment , because she was not yet fully awake , her reflexes controlled her , and she lashed out ; then she came to herself and stopped , her fingers alreadyhooking behind Sken 's ears , her thumbs poised to gouge out the riverwoman 's eyes . " Sweet lass , " said Sken. " just what your mother hoped you 'd grow up to be , I bet . " The condemnation in Sken 's words , the residue of momentary terror in her voice , the loathing revealed by the scant light that crossed the woman 's face  --  This is how they see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play with their children , dance at the festival until they 're drenched with sweat , scream and whine and accuseeach other in the market . To them , a child my age should be a virgin at heart . If I were wise in the ways of love , that would sadden them , yes , as it does all adults when a child 's body comes awake . But to see a child so young already ripe in violence and murder  --  I am a monstrous thing to Sken , like the deformed babies who are strangled and burned by the midwives . Almost she said this : I was trained to be what I am , and I 'm the best at what I do . Then Sken would accuse her : This is the second time you tried to kill me . Or perhaps ask a bitter question : Do you murder even in your sleep ? Then Patience would say : How do you think a king keeps the peace , if not with tools like me ?  |p108But  she would not defend herself . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , but wishing would n't change the past . She had no more need to defend what she was than a mountain had to defend itself for being tall and craggy , or worn down and knobby , or whatever other shape it might have . What I am is what was done to me , not what I chose . So instead of answering Sken 's ironic words , Patience lived up to her name , and quietly asked , " Why did you wake me ? " " You were crying out in your sleep . " " I do n't do that , " said Patience . Had n't Angel schooled her to be utterly silent in her sleep ? She remembered all too well the cold water dashed in her face to wake her each time she made a sound , until she learned habits of sleep that kept her still . " Then it 's a miracle , a voice coming out of the air above your bed , and sounding just like you . " " What did I say ? " " From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . That a lover was prying at you as vigorous as a farmer rooting out a stump in a field . " Only then did the memory of her dream come back to her , and with it the Cranning call . " He does it to me , " she whispered . " He sends me dreams . Waking , sleeping  --  " Sken nodded knowingly . " You dream until your whole body 's ready for him , but he never comes to you . " " I have to go to him . " " The curse of women , " said Sken . " We know how they mean to use our love for them , we know the whole price of it is ours to pay , but still we go , and still we stay . " " This one 's no ordinary lover , " said Patience . Sken patted her head . " Oh , true . True , the one you love is never ordinary . " What , did she really think Patience was lovesick like some village maiden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had such a girlish feeling , she wondered for a moment if Sken might not be right . But that was absurd . Patience had seen young girls in many noble houses , had heard them gossip about their real and would-be lovers . Unwyrm 's relentless calling was far stronger . Even now it stirred within her ; it took effort not to get up from her mat , leave the shabby inn , and walk , run , ride , or swim to Cranning.  |p109Still  , Sken 's ignorant assumptions were harmless enough . In other times , Patience would have seemed to accept Sken 's attempt at consolation . But she was too weary , too edgy from the Cranning call to care to play the diplomat . So she answered with the nastiness she felt . " And if I wait long enough , will I get over it ? " Sken , of course , had no diplomatic instincts . " You are a little bitch . A body tries to be nice  --  " Patience answered , as if to explain everything about herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have in your life . " Sken was still a moment , then smiled . " But you do n't know boats like I do . " " We 're not on the water now , " said Patience . " Nor are we assassinating anybody , " Sken answered . Patience lay back on the mat and smiled icily . Sken had made herpoint . " Death and the river , we each know our trade , " said Patience . " This lover who makes you sweat and cry out in your sleep  --  " " Not my lover , " said Patience . " He wants you , does n't he ? And you want him ? " " He wants me like a jackal hungers for a lamb . And I want him like  --  " " Like a fish wants water . " Patience shuddered . That 's how it felt , even now , like needing to take a breath , a deep long draught of air . But if she took that breath , it would be her last . " Sken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sken touched her gently , stroked the cold damp flesh of her arm with a single dry finger . " Flesh and bone . " " Paper . Folded this way and that , taking whatever shape they give me . Heir to the Heptagon House , daughter of Peace , assassin , diplomat , give me a shape , I 'll wear it , I 'll act the part , fold me again , again , I 'll be his lover , the one who calls me , and if he ever gets me , he 'll fold me down so small I 'll disappear . " Sken nodded wisely , her whole body jiggling just a little with the movement . " What if someone unfolded me all the way ? What would I be then ? " " A stranger , " said Sken . " Yes , even to me , " said Patience . " Just like everybody else . "  | " Oh , do you think so ! Do you think something like a normal woman lives inside this lovely delicate murderer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airs , " said Sken . " We 're all folded up , and nobody knows what we really are . But I know . We 're all identical , blank , empty pieces of paper . It 's the folding that makes us different . We are the folds . " Patience shook her head . " No , not me . Probably no one starts out blank and smooth , but certainly not me . I 'm more than what they 've done to me . I 'm more than the roles I have to play . " " What are you , then ? " " I do n't know . " She rolled over , faced the wall to end the conversation . " Maybe I wo n't find out until just before I die . " " Or maybe just after , when they take your head . " Patience rolled back , caught the folds of Sken 's robe in her tightclutchingfingers . " No , " she whispered harshly . " If they ever do that to me , promise you 'll split my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something " I wo n't promise that , " said Sken . " Why not ? " " Because if you 're in such a state that they could take your head , Heptarch , it means I 'm already dead . " Patience relaxed her grip on Sken 's clothing , lay back down . The knowledge of Sken 's loyalty was a comfort . But it was also a burden . Patience was so tired . " Go to sleep , " said Sken , " and do n't dream of love . " " What should I dream of , then , since you 're the master of sleep . " " Dream of murder , " said Sken . " Knowing you , you 'll sleep like a baby . " " I do n't love death , " whispered Patience . Sken patted her hand . " No , I did n't think so . " " I did n't want my father to die . Nor Angel to be injured , I did n't wish for it . " Sken looked puzzled . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , girl , " she whispered . " But it means you 're on your own now , does n't it ? For a time at least . So of course that feels good . " " Exciting , sometimes . Scary . " " And knowing you face the strongest enemy in the world , alone  --  " " Does n't make me feel good . "  | " Do n't lie , " said Sken . " You love it , sometimes . " " I hate him for what he 's making me want  --  " " But to sand alone against him , you want that , you want to face him alone and win . " " Maybe . " " It 's perfectly natural to feel that way . It 's also perfectly natural to be an idiot . " " I can kill anybody . " " Anybody you want to . " The words sank in . " You 're right , " said Patience . " How can I kill him , if he makes me love him ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Sken . " You need Angel . You need the goblins , disgusting as they are . Their pet giant , too . You may even need me . " " Even you , " whispered Patience . " Sleep now . We 're all with you , you 're at the center of everything , we 're all with you . Plenty of time to unfold yourself when this is over , and your lover 's plow is hung on a wall somewhere . " Patience slept . She never spoke of the night 's conversation again , but things were changed between her and Sken . They bickered as always , because Sken hardly knew another way to deal with people , but things were changed . There were ties between them , ties between sisters , strange sisters indeed , but good enough . In the morning they traveled again , a queer caravan . But Sken 's words had made a difference in the way Patience saw the others , too . She looked at them with new eyes , thinking , How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is the strength he has that makes up for a weaknessin me ? They were all dangerous  --  to her , but also to Unwyrm . The geblings especially , they were a mystery . The more Patience watched them , the more she realized that they did most of their communicatingwithout speech , each seeming to sense when the other was in need . She was jealous of their closeness ; she even tried to imitate them , going to Angel now and then , whenever she felt he might need her . Sometimes he did . More often he did n't . Whatever the geblings had , she lacked it . No special sensitivity . Geblings are too different from us . This power of theirs is something of this world , not from ours . They 're like Unwyrm . Both part of this place , and I 'm a stranger here.  |p112Then  the days of land travel were over . The river stretched before them again , this time with a busy town along its bank . It was no trouble finding a merchant to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the buyers were geblings , of course . So Patience dressed herself as a wealthy young man , took Will with her so no one would try to rob her , and did all the bargaining herself , without Ruin or Reek present to foul the deal . Geblings had a way of giving gifts to each other instead of making a profit , and though Patience knew that Angel 's small treasury had money enough to buy as many boats as she liked , she did n't want to waste their resources . When what he had was gone , it could not easily be renewed . The carriage gone , the money in hand , Patience  --  still looking for all the world like a cocky young man  --  took Sken with her to buy a boat . Sken was a riverwoman , after all ; who else could judge a boat 's fitness for their upstream voyage ? " Not that one , " said Sken , time after time . Too small , too deep a draft , in bad condition , doomed to sink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steer  --  reason after reason to reject boat after boat . " You 're too picky , " said Patience . " I 'm not planning to live the rest of my life on it . " " If you buy the wrong boat , " said Sken , " that 's exactly what you 'll do . " As they walked the bustling wharf , Patience noticed that the boats were all being sold or hired out by humans . " It was a gebling who bought our carriage , " she said . " Do n't they travel by water ? " " Do n't ask me about goblins , " said Sken . " I hope those two do n't travel by boat . " " They saved a life that 's dear to me , " said Patience . " And if they do sail with us , I hope they remember who 's captain of the ship . " " I 'm captain of the ship , " said Patience . " Not any ship I 'll sail on , nor any sane person neither , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that makes you owner . I 've got the knowhow , and that makes me captain . " " Supreme authority ? " " Not quite . " " Oh ? Who 's higher than the captain ? " It was n't Sken who answered . The voice came from Patience 's other side , and it belonged to a man . " Pilot ! " he said.  |p113Patience  turned  --  and saw no one , just a monkey jumping up and clown as it pumped at a bellows . The bellows was connected to a tube that ran down into a thick glass jar , then up into the windpipe of a bead whose eyes just peered over the top . " Pilot ? " asked Patience . Sken had not yet turned . " Yes , a pilot . Someone who knows the river . Every river is different , and different from year to year , as well . " " Then she saw the one who had spoken , the head perched in a thick glass jar . Sken wrinkled up her face . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good he 'll do . " " Been up and down Cranwater every one of the last two hundred years , " said the head . " Heads do n't learn , " said Patience . " Heads do n't pay attention , and they forget too quickly . " The monkey kept jumping up and down . It was distracting . " I pay attention , " said the pilot 's head . " I know this river . Some pilots , the river 's like an enemy , they wrestle it up and down . Some , it 's like a god , they worship , they pray , they curse . Some , it 's a whore for them , they think they 're in charge but she plays them for fools . Some , it 's a lover , a wife , a family , they live and die for it . But me  --  " " Come along , young sir , " said Sken . But Patience stayed to listen . " For me , the Cranwater 's not like anything else . This river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as God gave it to me that 's my name , the stream is my body , my arms , my legs . " The monkey stopped to pick a louse . The head grinned , but because the mouth was lower than the lip of the jar , the thick glass transformed the smile into a hideous leer . The monkey tasted the louse , swallowed , and went back to work . Again the breath came through the pilot 's throat . " My boat 's good , " said River . " Your boat 's a rotten old canoe , " said Sken . " So . You 're the captain , you get a good boat , but you come back and buy me for pilot . " " We 'll get a live pilot , thanks all the same , " said Sken . " That 's right , walk away , you 've got legs , you can just walk off , what 's that to you ? " A hawk swooped low , circled , came back and landed on a small platform atop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rat in one talon . It raked open the belly , spattering blood , snatched the gutsp114into its beak , then dropped the rest of the carcass into River 's jar . The jar lurched as the gools and headworms attached themselves and fed . " Pardon my lunch , " said River . " As you see , I 'm a self-contained system . You do n't have to feed me , though I 'm glad if you can keep my jar full of Cranwater , and it 's nice if you now and then wash my jar . Monkey 's apt to smear it with a bit of his stuff . " " Where 's your owner ? " asked Patience . Sken was irate . " You 're not thinking of  --  " " Go buy a boat , Sken . You have fifteen minutes . Choose the best , and I 'll come negotiate the price . " " I wo n't have this thing as pilot ! " " If Ruin and Reek have to put up with you as ship 's captain , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the one said the pilot was most important ? " " You 're enjoying this , " said Sken . " You 're making sport , and I thought we were friends . " " You 're not making a mistake , young master , " said River . " A pilot has to know the sandbars , the currents , the fast places , the slow places , the shallow channels , the spring rises , I know them all , I 'll get you through , provided you do as I tell you , up to and including that Queen of Grease you have with you , what do you do , harvest her sweat and sell it as lamp oil downriver ? " Patience laughed . Sken did not . " Buy the boat , " said Patience . " I want this pilot , for reasons that are good enough . " River cheered her on . " For reasons of wisdom , for reasons of  --  " " Shut up , " said Sken to River . Then to Patience : " Young sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know from how his face has aged and cracked that he 's at least two centuries , in hard sunlight and bad weather much of the time . " " Ah , it 's the truth , the torture of my life written on my face , " said River . " So he 's old , " said Sken . " He 's been a head at least a century , " said Patience . " Plying the river all that time . And in those many voyages , he 's never failed a customer . He 's never broken up a boat on a sandbar or a rock . " " How do you know that ? " Sken demanded . " Because the young master 's got the spirit of discernment of truth in him , " said River.  | " Because he 's here , " said Patience . " If he 'd ever let an owner down , his jar would have been broken , and he would have been poured out into the river long ago . " Sken glared , but had no answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the boats with an even more skeptical eye . " You 've got wisdom , " said River . " I hope that among the hundred sons I conceived when I could still do the mattress hornpipe , there 's one as well-favored and intelligent and  --  " " And rich . " " As your most gracious self . Though I could wish a son of mine might have more of a beard on him . " " As he would no doubt wish his father to have more limbs . " River giggled , an artificial-sounding laugh because it all came from his mouth . There could be no belly laugh , with the monkey pumping the bellows with the same steady rhythm . " Ay , there 's something lackingon both of us , I ca n't deny it . " " When will your owner come back ? " asked Patience . " When I send the monkey to fetch him . " " Then send . " " And miss out on conversation with such a likely young man ? I buggered a few as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , and they thanked me afterward . " " As I 'll thank you for mislaying your practical buggery tools before we met . " River winked . " Nothing shocks you , does it ? " " Nothing that lives in a jar , anyway , " said Patience . " Send the monkey . If you want to talk , I can read your lips . " River made three sharp kissing noises . Patience realized that it was a sound he could make without the bellows . The monkey immediately dropped the bellows and clambered around to perch on the lip of the jar , pressing his forehead against River 's . A few more chirping sounds , tongue clicks , lip pops , and the monkey dropped to the wooden dock and ran off through the crowd . River made a single clicking sound , and the hawk took off and flew away . Patience stood , reading his lips as he made jokes , told stories , and studied her with his eyes . All the while , Patience felt Unwyrm calling her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll have you . Not in words , it was never words , it was just the need . Fly to me now.  |p116I  'm coming , said Patience silently , trying hard not to think consciouslyof the murder in her mind . The head named River babbled on and on , looking less and less like her father the longer she watched . Good . She did n't need the distraction . Once they were on the water , Sken was in her element , and lorded it over them all . Never mind River muttering commands from his jar , which dangled from a pole near the helm ; Sken was glad enough to follow River 's orders about where to steer , once he showed that he really did know the river . Steering was the pilot 's business  --  everything else about the boat was Sken 's to decide . Only Angel , lying in comfort at last , without the bouncing of the road , only he was exempt from her orders . All the others , Sken kept them hopping with the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oar . She took particular pleasure in ordering Reck and Ruin to climb the mast and fiddle with the two sails  --  she watched with unbearable satisfactionon her face as they dangled over the water doing her bidding . The height did n't seem to bother them , nor the work , but the water itself seemed to make them uncomfortable . And credit Sken with this : she did not abuse her authority . Like any good captain , she knew that the geblings would obey her , but only as long as she ordered them to do what was clearly needful . Patience did her part as well , a full share of work , like any of the others . At first Sken was uneasy ordering her about , but if she left Patience without labor , Patience would come and ask , until Sken barked out commands to her as easily as to anyone . Patience was grateful for anything that engaged her mind . The Cranning call was relentless , but it was easier to live with when she was busy . So she spent many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or leaning on the helm as River ordered their way upstream , tacking across the currentto keep the wind , easing into deep channels with oars or poles to get past the tricky places  --  it was a vigorous , hardworking life , and Patience came to love the river , partly because of the peace it brought to her , partly for the life itself . Sken 's coarseness and crudity became vigor and strength , when seen within the river life . For all that Sken was a good captain , though , she was not perfect . Patience noticed within a few days that Sken tyrannized Will withoutp117mercy , perhaps merely because he let her do it . No doubt they weighed about the same , but she was a good meter less in height . It was comical , watching him pull on a rope or haul something above or below deck , his massive muscles rippling along his body as he worked , while all the time the jiggling fat woman scolded and cursed him . Poor Will , thought Patience . All the pangs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore it well and did n't seem to mind . It became part of the equilibrium . Patience let it go . It was early morning . Will was drawing up the anchor while Reck was raising the sail . Ruin sat in the bow , staring glumly ahead . Sken sent Patience to secure a line when Reck threw it down , and the task brought her near to Ruin , who was not working this shift . She saw him shudder at her approach . " Is it that strong , when you feel him calling me ? " she asked . He nodded , not looking at her . " Who is he , this Unwyrm ? " " Unwyrm . Himself . " " But what does he look like ? " " No one has ever seen him . " " Where did he come from ? " " He was born from the same belly as the geblings . " This was a religious language , of course , and Patience mentally deciphered it into her own version of reality . " He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be . Only more powerful than any gebling . And he hates us . That 's all we know about him . " He raised a lazy hand to point at the river . " This water  --  he fills it with hate and sends it down to freeze us . " " The call  --  does it work like the way that you and Reck call to each other ? " " We ca n't control each other , if that 's what you mean , " said Ruin . " We feel it , and that 's all . We feel it best between siblings . The closer your blood . Reck and I are twins . " " But Unwyrm does it at will ? " " He even does it to humans . None of us can do that . " " So he 's like a gebling , only more powerful . " Ruin seemed angry . " He 's nothing like a gebling . " " Then why do you call him he ? How do you know he 's a male ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's looking for the seventh seventhp118seventh daughter , and not the seventh seventh seventh son . " Ruin turned slowly to face her . He was smiling , and it was n't pleasant . " What good would it do him to mate with a human ? The offspring would never be viable . Starborne and native life ca n't interbreed . " " You humans put such touching faith in your myths . " He was just trying to torment her . Patience had seen him do the same with Reck , and she refused to pay any attention to it . " Is he one of another species , then ? " " Perhaps . Or maybe he 's the only one of his species that ever lived . " " That 's impossible . Species do n't come out of nowhere . They have parents . There are generations . I know enough science for that . " " The best thing about science , " said Reck , walking up behind Patience , " is that it keeps fools from ever discovering the truth , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ruin frowned at her . " Maybe human science , " he said . Reck grabbed the fur of the back of his hand , then slapped his hand away . " Ow , " he muttered . He cradled the hurt hand in the other , as if it were a deep injury . Reck smiled sweetly . " You 're no better a scientist than the humans are . " I 've seen what I 've seen , and not what I wanted to see or expected to see , which is more than you can say for any of them . " His gesture toward Patience was fluid with contempt . Reck tossed her head . " If you asked the Wise among the humans , they 'd say the same to you . You never see anything that you are n't prepared to see , and when you do , you name it with the old names and pretend you understood it all along . And then everybody tells everybody else what everybody has already agreed to say , and everyone feels reassured about the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nastily . His anger , Patience saw , was not all pretended . " That 's what Mother commanded me to be , when she named me . Reck , child , it means think , it means calculate , it means wonder about the causes of things . ' " " Your names are commands ? " asked Patience . " Then your parents had sweet plans in mind for you , Ruin . " Ruin and Reck both looked at her as if they had forgotten she was there . They had shown her more of their private relationship than ap119human was supposed to see . Patience was ashamed of herself for makingthem feel embarrassed . She , too , had forgotten that she had to be diplomatic . A diplomat is always the wary stranger , never the intimate friend . To the surprise of all and the liking of none , they had forgotten , for a moment , that they were not and never could be friends . Patience smiled ruefully and walked away , feeling their eyes on her back like knives . But not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cranning . Was this great need the torture that Father 's head endured , when the headworms sparked all his longings ? Did he break under this pressure , or was his much worse ? Will I come before this Unwyrm , who wants a woman , not a man , and break under this need like a disbodied head that has lost all will to resist ? Will I be so hungry then that whatever he wants me to do , I 'll mindlessly do , with no thought of resistance ? With that thought in mind , she spent the morning making something for herself from the things she found in Angel 's strongbox . A pellet of poison , which she could take if things went wrong . " What a clumsy solution . " It was Angel 's voice . At once she closed his box , like a little girl caught by her father . " It belongs to you , " said Angel , " because I belong to you . " " I do n't feel like it does , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's a very subtle thing . Most people think they own many things , and do n't . You think you never owned anything , and yet you do . " " What do I own ? " " Me . This box . All of mankind . " She shook her head . " I may have responsibility for all of mankind , but I never asked for it , and I do n't own them . " " Ah . So you think duty and ownership are different things . The mother and father care for the baby and keep it alive  --  do they own it ? And if they do n't care for it , is it truly theirs ? The child obeys the parents , serves them , and as they depend on its service , the child comes to own them , also . Yet he deceives himself that he is owned . " " You 're very subtle , but if you 're trying to say that I owned Father , you really have no hope of being one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what I said is true . But I confess that most people think of ownership another way . They think they own what theyp120make part of themself . Like Sken , with this boat . She feels its parts as if they were part of her ; she feels the wind on the sail as if the sail were her body and the wind tilted her forward ; she feels the rocking of the boat as if it were the rhythmic beating of her own heart . She owns this boat , because this boat is part of herself . " " The way River owns Cranwater . " " Yes , " said Angel . " He does n't feel the loss of his body , because currents and flows , banks and channels , they 're his arms and legs , his gut and groin . " Patience tried to think of something she owned as Sken owned the boat . There was nothing she felt was part of herself . Nothing at all . Even her clothing , even her weapons were not her own , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked and unarmed , and therefore no stronger than her own wit and no larger than the reach of her own arms and legs . " If that 's ownership , then I own nothing , " said Patience . " Not so . You own no one thing , because you have let nothing becomepart of you , except a few weapons and languages and memories . But you also own everything , because the whole world , as a whole , it is part of you , you feel the face of the globe as if it were your own body , and all the pains of mankind as if they were your own pains . " Let him think what he wants , but I know it is n't so . I do n't feel all mankind as mine , though Father taught me often that that was what the Heptarch ought to feel . I am solitary , cut off from everyone and everything . But believe what you like , Angel . She changed the subject . " Are you sure you 're well enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not walking right now , am I ? I 'm sitting . Actually , though , I 've felt much better for days . I just enjoy being lazy . " " I 've needed you so much , these weeks  --  " " You have n't needed me at all , and you 've rather enjoyed finding out that you could do things on your own . But I 'm glad you did n't decide to jettison me . I can be useful to you , you know . For instance , you do n't need that poison . " " I might . " " You have something better . " " What ? " " The globe you took from your father 's shoulder after he died . " Father had told her that no one else knew he had it . " What globe is that ? "  | " For more than a week on the Glad River , every time we slept ashore you spent fifteen minutes sifting through your nightstools . There 's only one thing you could have swallowed that was worth performingsuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep . " " Child , who could sleep through a stench like that ? " " Do n't be foul , Angel . " " I assume you found it . " " Father told me to take it , but never what it did , or how to use it . " " Your father never used it . Or at least , not to its full capacity . To be fully useful , it must be placed somewhere else in your body . In the deepest place in your brain . " Angel smiled . " And right now you have a very good surgeon . " " Father told me that I should never let a gebling know I have this . " " One must take risks in this world . " " What is it ? " He switched into Gauntish . " Your scepter , my beloved Heptarch . But few of your recent predecessors have had the courage to wear it in their brain . " She answered in the same language . " You 're saying Father was n't brave enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . But it 's had such varying effects on different Heptarchs . Some have gone quite mad . One of them even murdered all his children , except one . Another started simultaneous wars with all his neighbors and ended up with the kingdom reduced to Heptam itself and a few islands to the west . Other Heptarchs have said it is like seeing the world for the first time , and they ruled brilliantly . But the odds are against you . Still , planted in your brain , it responds to your desires . Once it was there , if you ever truly wanted to die , you would die . So you might want to take the risk . " " What if it drove me mad ? " " Then you would probably become obsessed with going to Cranning to face the enemy of mankind , unprepared , uninformed , and unlikely to do anything but fail . " " In other words , what I 'm doing now ? " " How could you do anything more insane ? Unless you decided to take along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as you 've got them safely to Unwyrm. "  |p122She  remembered what he had said about geblings a moment ago . " Why am I forbidden to let a gebling see that I have this jewel ? " " Because it is n't a jewel . " " It is n't ? " " It 's an organic crystal taken from the brain of the King of Cranning in the fifth generation of the world . " " The gebling king . What did he use it for ? " " The geblings were reluctant to discuss it with us . We know how it works on humans , but who knows what it did for him . " Patience nodded . " If it was stolen from the gebling king , I suppose by right it belongs to Reck and Ruin . " An expression passed suddenly across Angel 's face , then vanished . Not a grimace that anyone else could see , for Angel was skilled at keeping his face blank . But Patience saw it , and knew that he was surprised , perhaps even frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , together , the brother and sister were king of the geblings ? Of course he did n't know . Ruin had been sewing Angel 's wound when Patience overheard the geblings ' conversation that revealed to her who they were . Angel had been unconscious , and no one had spoken of it since . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " Did n't you know they were king ? It 's something I overheard when you were not yet healed . " " No , I had no idea . I 'll have to think about that , " said Angel . " That might change things . It might indeed . It gives me pause . " He smiled and patted her hand , looking mildly nonplussed . But Patience was even more confused than before . For Angel was lying to her . She knew what he would look like if his words were sincere and he were hiding nothing . But he was hiding something  --  all he showed right now was his mask . He had not been surprised at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change any plans . He had known all along who the geblings were . And if that was so , then what he had n't known was that she knew who they were . There are two things to do with a lie : pretend you believe it , or confront the liar with your knowledge of the lie . The first is what you do with enemies ; she could only think of Angel as a friend . " How long have you known ? " she asked him . He was preparing to lie to her again , then stopped himself . " No , " he said . " You 're the Heptarch now , and I ca n't hold back from you . Yourp123father told me their names , many years ago , their names and where they lived . The Heptarchy has made it a point to keep track of the gebling kings . " " So you knew all along that they were in that village . " " Your father knew , and warned me . They add just one more uncertaintyto the equation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I would n't have had an arrow in my throat , either . " He chuckled . " But I do n't mind . " She smiled at him , but he was still lying to her . Something was wrong with what he said . Perhaps he had n't known who they were . Perhaps Father had n't warned him . It was impossible to guess , and she could n't very well ask him now . With his first lie , he might still be a friend . With the second lie , she could only treat him as an enemy . Let him think his lie has succeeded , Father taught her , and your enemy wo n't be driven to more desperate measures . What bothered her most was that never before in her life had she thought of Angel as her enemy . " What did Father fear they would do , when he warned you ? " " I do n't know . I thought at the time he feared another gebling invasion . But I do n't think it 's human blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the geblings to Skyfoot with a cry of war on their lips . These two are almost in disguise . No gebling king has ever traveledin the company of humans . Living humans , anyway . " The more she listened to him , the more obvious it became that it was all lies , and Angel was growing more and more confident that she believed him . Angel had a plan , no doubt something he and Father had worked out some time ago , and part of the plan required him not to tell her all he knew . She was still a child in Angel 's eyes , still not to be trusted with the knowledge to make an intelligent decision on her own . Angel was determined to keep her blind and force her down the road he and Father had chosen for her . Well , Angel , you may find I 'm not quite the helpless babe you think I am . I ca n't force you to confide in me , but when the time comes , you 'll wish you had , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you like it or not , and if you try to stop me , Angel , even you might find that I 'm too much for you . She did n't believe it , though . Her bravado was a sham . Never before had she felt so childish and weak as now . I am not Heptarch yet , she realized . I have no kingdom and no power , just the destiny that youp124and Father and Unwyrm and the geblings and the priests all have in mind for me . You have so many plans for me that no matter what I do , it 's what someone wanted me to do . A single puppet with a thousand strings , and I do n't know who is holding any of them . Her face showed none of this to Angel . Instead she smiled wickedly , the way she did when she teased him . " So you think I 'd be safe to let Ruin know I have the scepter that should be his , and then ask him to cut open my brain and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did n't say it was without risks . " She poked him playfully . " Go back to spending the days asleep . You were more helpful then . " She could see his tension ease , as she pretended to be the lighthearted , trusting girl she had always been with him in private . He believed her . " I think Ruin will agree , " he said , " that the scepter is more human than gebling now . " I'he Heptarchs have had it for more than three hundred generations . Still , I 'm not saying you should up and tell him right now . " " It 's impossible to know what to do , " she said . " All the prophecies hint at disaster , but they do n't tell me what causes the disaster . AnythingI choose might destroy the world or save it , and I do n't know which is which . And you are n't even going to help me decide . " He smiled . " You knew you might be leading the world to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm just going along for the ride . Been lots of fun , so far . " He got up and walked weakly back to his pallet under the canopy . Patience sat and watched the water for some time . Just when she had begun to feel confident , Angel turned out to be playing his own game . There was no one she could trust completely . Yet she could n't brood for long . For whenever her attention was not closely engaged with work or conversation , her mind turned back to that constant , nagging need to go north , to go upriver , to find relief from the urgent pressure of her body 's desire . River 's hawk circled , swooped down to the boat . She turned to watch as it tore open a dove , ate its gut , and dropped the body , feathers and all , into the jar . The monkey was playing with itself ; this was a calm , slow reach of the river , so the pilot did n't need a voice for a while . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery to her.  |p125River  himself , he was fairly easy to understand ; like all heads , he was somewhat insane , living for the journey up and down Cranwater . As long as the boat was sailing , he was well rewarded . But the monkey and the hawk  --  what did they get ? The monkey ate with the humans , and seemed content enough . Besides , he had nowhere else to go . Monkeys were a species humans had brought with them to this world ; they had no natural habitat here , and could survive only as pets . So maybe , at some primitive level , the monkey knew that his slavery at the bellows was the only way that he could live . But the hawk  --  she could not understand the hawk . It could provide for itself . It needed no one . What did it gain from its service to River ? Why did it stay ? River had no hands to restrain it , no power to reward or punish it . The hawk seemed to live for pure generosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , feeding the head out of the same instinct that made parents feed their children . Or perhaps the hawk had been trained , folded into a pattern in which it could not conceive of leaving River to die . Perhaps the hawk did not long for freedom . Or perhaps , being free , this was what the hawk freely chose to do . When Will called them to dinner at noon , Patience did not want to come . It was Reck 's hand on her shoulder that brought her . " Whatever Angel said to you , " whispered the gebling woman , " you 're still the heart of all our futures . Come , eat . " Yes , thought Patience . Come , puppet . Come , folded paper . Dance your dance , hold the shape we gave you . Until your usefulness is over . Then someone  --  the geblings , Unwyrm , perhaps some mad Vigilant along the way  --  someone will burn you up.  |p126Late  one afternoon they were trimming sail as they rounded a bend through a narrow channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monkey began to screech . By now everyone knew this meant River wanted a quick change in course . They stopped all conversation and listened  --  River 's voice was never loud . " Hard port ! " he said . Will , who was at the helm , heeled the lever toward the starboard side , and almost at the same moment Sken grabbed Patience and a gebling and ran to the left side of the boat . Patience only had time to catch a glimpse of what they were avoiding  --  a large buoy , big enough that if they had collided head on , with their speed from such a brisk wind , it would have done real damage to buoy and boat alike . As it was , they still bumped into it , but side-on and slower . " That 's supposed to be two mile upriver , " said the pilot . " Last flood season must have dragged her anchor down here so far . Cast a line . " Sken did n't hesitate . She knotted a rope onto a grappling hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it against the buoy , now bobbing some dozen yards behind them . The hook caught on the firstp127throw , but Patience did n't know whether that was remarkable or just what a competent riverwoman would be expected to do . " What are you doing with that ! " demanded Ruin . " Putting it back where it belongs , " said Sken , as if it were a fact that should be obvious even to a child . " None of our affair , " said Ruin . " There 's too many on the river feels that way already , " said Sken . " But River and me , we feel the same on this . When something 's out of place that you can fix , then you fix it , so next pilot wo n't risk what almost got us . " They got back on course through the channel , and then it was clear sailing for a while . Long enough to take a better look at the buoy . It had a sign on it , at such an angle that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern on the starboard side . In Geblic , Gauntish , Dwelf , and Agarant  --  the language all traveling humans used , regardless of their native tongue  --  the sign advertised a single thing for sale : ANSWERSAngel laughed aloud when Patience told him what it said . " When have you seen such arrogance before ? " " Maybe they 're not selling , " said Reck . " Maybe they 're buying . " Patience did not laugh . It was too ironic . If there was anything she needed right now , it was answers . And here they were , offered in trade . Two miles on , they dropped anchor and hauled in the buoy . Sken and Will lashed it to the boat , then hauled up the buoy 's anchor and added a bag of ballast to it . It was an hour 's work at most , but Patience took no part in it , so she had time to look for the place on shore where the answers might be found . It was n't a heavily settled area , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps a quarter-mile walk from the river . If the house had been one of the common inns along the river , preying upon travelers with rigged games , indigestible food , and bugriddenbeds , Patience would not have had them put ashore . Instead , though , it was old and modest , and far enough back from the water that it could n't be a money trap for travelers . If they had n't anchored to fix the buoy , it would have been visible only for a moment in a gap between trees along the river 's edge . To Patience , this suggested thatp128the sign was sincere enough . It was a place for people who wanted truth enough to work to get it  --  out of the way , hard to reach , with only a single sign to tell them what it was , and only a single sight to tell them where . Of course , the moment she thought of stopping , Patience felt the pressure of the Cranning call within her , urging her to go on , faster , faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not trying to get her to avoid this place in particular . But because the need to hurry on was so great , and because she knew that someone else was producingthat need within her , she resisted for the sake of resistance , the way that she had deliberately endured extra suffering as a child , to inure herself to hardship . When Will and Sken climbed aboard the boat and began unlashing the buoy , Patience spoke her decision . " Bring the boat ashore . " " At that place ! " said Sken . " I will not ! We 'll pass a dozen better inns before nightfall . " Patience smiled and spoke to River . " The pilot sets the course , the captain rules the life aboard the ship , but the owner says what ports the ship will visit . Am I right ? " River winked at her . Sken cursed , but instead of raising sail again , she and Will poled the boat to shore . They touched the ragged-looking pier that ran out into the river and tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angel , Patience led Will and the geblings ashore . Angel demanded to be taken along . Patience ignored him . She did n't feel the same need to defer to him that she had felt before he started lying to her . There was n't much of a path up the hill . Patience let Ruin lead the way  --  he could find a trail on bare rock in a rainstorm , or so it seemed . Reck and Will fell into place behind her . It was as though she were truly Heptarch , with an escort before and behind ; or a prisoner , with keepers to cut off all escape . The hilltop house was even shabbier than it had looked from below . The windows were unglazed and unshuttered , and the smell of the yard out back made it plain that the pigs were responsible for washing themselves . " Could it be that no one lives here now ? " asked Patience . Ruin grunted . " Fire 's lit . " " And there 's fresh water in the kitchen , " added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ca n't find out with their noses ? " Will shrugged . Not too bright , thought Patience . But what could you expect of the sort of man who 'd live with geblings ? Their knock on the door brought a quick shout from inside . A femalevoice , and not a young one . " I 'm coming ! " The cry was in commonspeech , but the accent told Patience that it was not her native tongue . And sure enough , it was a dwelf , smaller than the geblings , with the half-size head that made them look spectacularly repulsive . " From a dwelf we 're supposed to get answers ? " asked Ruin , with his usual tact . The dwelt frowned at him . " To a goblin I 'm supposed to give them ? " " At least she speaks in complete sentences , " said Reek . But it was Patience who reached out her hand for the dwelf to lick her fingers . Custom satisfied , the dwelf invited them in , and immediatelyled Patience to what was obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as always , hung back to stand by the door . He never seemed to consider himself to be part of what was going on . Only a watcher , a listener . Or perhaps not even that , perhaps an accessory , like a horse , to be brought forward only when needed . The dwelf brought them boiling water and let them choose the leaves for the tea . Patience inquired about the possibility of getting rooms with closable windows for the night . " That depends , " said the dwelf . " On what ? Tell us the price . " " Oh , the price , the price . The price is good answers for my questions , and good questions for my answers . " " You can never communicate with a dwelf , " said Ruin impatiently . " You get more intelligent conversation from trees . " He spoke in Geblic , but it was obvious that the dwelf had at least caught the gist of what he said . Patience suspected that she actually understood Geblic , which would make her much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Patience , " what sort of question you have in mind ? " " Only the Wise stay here , " said the dwelf . " The Wise from all lands , and they leave behind their wisest thoughts before they go . " " Then we 've come to the wrong place , " said Patience . " All the Wiseleft our lands before I was born . "  | " I know , " said the dwelf sadly . " But I make do with what comes along nowadays . You would n't happen to be an astronomer , wouldyou ? " Patience shook her head . " You have an urgent need for one ? " asked Reck . " Oh , not urgent , not urgent . It just seems to be a lost art , which should surprise you , considering that we all came from the stars . " " She did , and the big one at the door , " said Ruin . " The rest of us are native born . " The dwelf smiled a little . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are natives here ? " Now , for the first time , Patience began to wonder if she should n't take this dwelf seriously , not just out of courtesy , but because she might know something of value . Certainly her hint that the geblings were also starborn implied that her ideas would at least be interesting . Interestingenough that Angel ought to be here . She might be annoyed with him , might not trust him , but Patience was not such a fool that she would reject the possibility of profiting from what truth he would tell her . She turned to Reck . " Do you think Will would go down and bring Angel up ? " Reck looked annoyed . " I do n't own Will , " she said . Since Will acted far more like a slave than Angel did , Patience thought Reck 's pretense of not controlling him was ridiculous . Will never did anything unless Reck had given him permission first . Still , Patience offered no retort , but merely turned to Will and asked if he thought he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but left immediately . " Why are you sending for more of your party , " asked the dwelf , " when I have n't said that you could stay ? " " Because Angel is the closest thing to a wise man we have with us . He 's a mathematician . " " He 's a nothing , then . Numbers and more numbers . Even if you understand enough to ask the questions , the answers mean nothing at all . " This delighted Patience , who had said much the same thing to Angel on more than one occasion . She could have recited Angel 's answer , too , since she had memorized it from the sheer repetition . Instead , though , Patience took the dwelf at her word . She offered an/swers , so why not ask the question that mattered most ? " Let me ask you a question . Who and what is Unwyrm , and what does he want ? " The dwelf smiled in delight , jumped to her feet , and ran out of the room . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reck , " then she knows what no other living soul knows . " Soon the dwelf came bounding back into the room . " Unwyrm is the brother of geblings , gaunts , and dwelfs , and the son of the Starship Captain 's possessor , " she said . " His mother once had the whole world , and he wants it back . " She beamed with pride . Ruin cut in , impatiently . " Anybody could make up this kind of mix of truth and speculation  --  " " Hush , " said Patience . Then , to the dwelf , she said , " I 'm sorry , I missed part of that , where you said  --  " Before she could finish , the dwelf said it again . " Unwyrm is the brother of geblings , gaunts , and dwelfs , and the son of the Starship Captain 's possessor . His mother once had the whole world , and he wants it back . " Again she smiled the identical smile . It was as if they had seen the same moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had memorized . Ruin looked at Reck , then smiled . " All right , now let us give you a question , " said Ruin . " Where is the mindstone of the ancient gebling kings ? " Patience had little trouble guessing the answer to this question herself , but controlled her own misgivings and feigned ignorance . " What 's the mindstone ? " she began . But the dwelf was already up and running out of the room . And while she was gone , Reck and Ruin kept touching each other 's faces as if each were studiously forming the other 's likeness in clay . Patience decided there was more to their question than a mere test . And sure enough , when the dwelf came back into the room , they turned to her and waited intently for her reply , showing more interest than Patience thought their stolid faces could ever show . " The mindstone of the gebling kings , which became the scepter of the Heptarchs , is imbedded in the shoulder of Peace , the rightful Heptarch . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will give it to his daughter before he dies . " The dwelf nodded wisely . Reck and Ruin turned to look at Patience , who said nothing , tryingp132to keep her face a mask of polite bafflement . There was no way this dwelf could possibly have known about her father 's secret . Watching the silent tableau of geblings staring at the human girl , the dwelf began to giggle insanely . " And now you 've answered my question , all of you . " Patience turned to her politely . " And what is your question ? " " My question of you is , who are you , and why do geblings and humans travel together this way ? " " And what was our answer ? " asked Reck . " Your answer was that you are the gebling king , the boy and girl of you , and you , human , are the daughter of Peace , the Heptarch , and he is dead , and you now have the mindstone and scepter . You 're going into battle , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same side . " This was no ordinary dwelf . Patience drew the slender glass rod of her blowgun from the cross at her neck . She also took the loop from her hair . She spoke quietly to Reck and Ruin , in a tone of calm , sure intention . " If you move from your places , you 'll be dead before you take a step . " " Oh , my , " said the dwelf . " You should n't ask for answers that you do n't want to hear . Let 's not have any killings here . This is a place where the only traffic is in truth . Let me have your oath , all of you , that you 'll wait to kill each other until you get back to the river . " No one volunteered to take the oath . " What have I done ? Trouble , trouble , that 's what the truth is . You poor fools  --  you thought a dwelf could never know anything , and so you asked me the questions whose answer you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answers . Every one of them . " " Do you ? " asked Reck . " Then tell us how to resolve our dilemma . However you knew the answer , Patience has as much as confessed that she has the most precious possession of the gebling kings . Now more than ever before in our history we must have it , we must know its secrets . We would gladly kill her to get it , and she would as gladly kill us to keep it for herself . When Will comes back , we 'll have no difficultykilling her , so she 'll have to kill us before he gets here . " " I told you , take an oath , " said the dwelf . " We would never keep an oath about the mindstone , " said Ruin , " nor would we believe her if she made one . "  | " I do n't even know what it is , " said Patience . " I only know that Father said to keep it at all costs , and Angel said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruin laughed . " He thought that I , once I had it in my hands , would put it into you ? " Reck , still not moving , silenced him with a hiss . Then she said , " Patience , my fool of a brother does n't understand . Though the mindstoneby rights belongs to us , it 's no good to us now . " " No good to us ! " said Ruin . " When the humans first thought to put it in their brains , it drove them mad . There was too much gebling in it . But now we could never put it in our own minds  --  there 's too much human in it . " Ruin frowned . " There 's a chance we could use it . " " And there 's a better chance we could destroy ourselves trying . " Ruin looked furious . " After so many years  --  and we find it now at the time of greatest need , and you say we ca n't use it ! " But his anger turned immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's true . " Patience was skeptical . This could be a trick to lull her into complacency . So she turned to the dwelf for the only help she could think to ask for . " I have a question for you , " she said . " Tell me what the scepter does when it 's connected to the brain . " " If I leave to get the answer , " said the dwelf , " you 'll probably kill each other before I get back , and then I can never ask you anything more . " " If they do n't leave their chairs , then I wo n't kill then , " said Patience . " We wo n't leave our chairs , " said Reck . " But do n't be too sure you could kill us , " said Ruin . Patience smiled . The dwelf shuddered and left the room . There was no spring in her step this time . She came back in muttering to herself . " It 's long , " she said . " I 'm listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When implanted above the limbic node in the human brain , the organic crystal called the scepter or mindstone grows smaller crystals that penetrate to every portion of the brain . Most of these are passive , collecting important memories and thoughts . A few of them , however , allow the human to receive memories pre/viously stored in the crystal by prior occupants . Since many of the memories belong to the first seven gebling kings , in whose brains the crystal originated , this can be most disorienting to the human . If the human is not able to gain control of the crystal , the alien memoriescan impinge on the mind in unwelcome and unmanageable ways , lending to confusion of identity , which is to say , madness . The safest way to use the crystal is to implant it in a protected-place near a fairly important nerve . One or two chains of crystal will make their way to the brain , collecting memories but almost never supplying any to the human host . But there 's bloody little chance that you 'll ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of them laughed at the last sentence . " Whoever gave you that answer , dwelf , was n't as wise as he thought . " " I know , " said the dwelf . " That 's why I left it in , so you could see that I asked him a good question after all , even though he thought I did n't . " " And what happens when it 's implanted in a gebling 's brain ? " asked Patience . " But why would anyone do that ? " asked the dwelt . " All a gebling has to do is  --  " " Silence ! " whispered Ruin . " No , " said Reck . " No , let her tell . " " All a gebling has to do , " said Heffiji , " is swallow it . The gebling body can break the crystal into its tiniest pieces , and it will form again exactly where it ought to be in the gebling 's brain . " " How could that happen ? " asked Patience . " Why can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because we 're born with mindstones , " said Ruin , scornfully . " We all have them . And we eat our parents ' mindstones when they die , to carry on the memories that mattered most to them in their lives . " He looked at Reck with bitter triumph , as if to say , Well , you said to tell her , and now I have . Patience looked from one to the other in growing understanding . " So all those stories that geblings eat their dead  --  " Reck nodded . " If a human saw it , though it 's hard to believe a gebling would ever let them see  --  " " Dwelfs too , " said Heffiji . " And gaunts. "  | " There are mindstones of some sort , much smaller than ours , too small to see , in all the animals of this world , " said Ruin . " Except humans . Crippled , fleshbound humans , whose souls die with them . " Our souls die , thought Patience , except those whose heads are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than once . How did the taking of heads begin ? Why did human scientists ever try to keep a head alive ? Because they knew , hundreds of generations ago , they knew that the native species had a kind of eternal life , a part of their brain that lived on after death . They were jealous . Taking heads was the human substitute for the mindstones of the geblings , dwelfs , and gaunts . Instead of the crystal globe of the mindstone , for us it was gools , headworms , and eviscerated rats dropped by a hawk into a glass jar . " Only the Heptarchs , among all humans , have taken their parents into themselves , " said Reck . " And that was only by stealing our noblest parents from us . Your ancestor killed the seventh king and stole his mindstone , so that the kings of the geblings have no memory now of how the kingdom began . Ruin is of the foolish opinion that it would he of some advantage to us to have it now . I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our advantage if we had had it all along . " " I must have it , " said Ruin . " If I 'm to know what I must know  --  " " Unwyrm wants you to do it , Ruin . " Reck seemed to enjoy forcing her brother to bow before her superior understanding . " It would please him , to have half the gebling king a babbling lunatic . Fool . If it drove humans insane , with their incomplete coupling with the stone , what do you think it will do to you , to be utterly and perfectly bonded to more than three hundred human minds ? No gebling is strong enough to endure that . " Patience could see that Ruin was not pretending now ; he was yieldingto his sister 's arguments . If she said nothing , it was clear the dispute would be settled with the scepter left peacefully in her possession , perhapseven implanted in her brain . Yet if it was so dangerous that Ruin would not use it , she had to know more of what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds so alien to each other ? " she asked . " We speak each other 's languages , we  --  " " You do n't understand the beginning of the gebling mind  --  " began Ruin . " It 's our strength , " said Reck , " and our weakness . We 're never alonep136from the moment of our birth . Isolation is a meaningless word to us . We can feel other geblings on the fringes of our consciousness , awake and asleep . When we swallow a mindstone , we become the person whose stone we swallowed , for days , sometimes weeks and months , until we can sort out all the memories and put them in their place . If Ruin had to become human that way , three hundred times over , the isolation would probably be unbearable , like the death of half himself . You , though , a human being  --  you 're used to loneliness because you never know anything else . And the mindstone does n't bond so perfectlywith you . A strong human  --  like you  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you , " Ruin said . " I think so , yes , " said Reck . " It may make her even more subject to Unwyrm 's will , " he said . " But what does that matter ? At worst , it would make her a helpless pawn to Unwyrm . Since that 's how she 'll probably end up anyway , what difference does it make ? " Patience shuddered inwardly at their utter lack of sympathy for her . Even she , a sometime assassin , still felt some understanding , some elementary kinship with the people that she killed . Now , for the first time , she realized that they regarded her as a beast , not a person . They assessed her as a man might assess a good horse , speaking of its strengths and weaknesses candidly , in the horse 's presence . The differencewas that Patience could understand . Ruin , still angry despite having to admit that his sister was right , turned to Patience . " I 'll implant the mindstone , on two conditions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reck or our children when you die . " " Why , when you can never use it ? " asked Patience . " When all this is over , " Ruin said , " and my work is done , then I can use it . If it mads me , then it 's no worse than death , and I 'm not afraid to die . But if I succeed in mastering it , then all we lost will be restored to us , and I can pass it to my heir . " " I 'll make you a different oath , " said Patience . " Implant it , and if I die in the presence of the king of the geblings , I 'll make no effort to stop them from taking it , whoever they are . " Ruin smiled . " It amounts to the same thing . Only you must promise to make every effort to die in the presence of the king of the geblings . " " If you promise to make no effort to hasten that day . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't need any oaths . You 'll implantit in her because it 's no use to you , and you 'll get it back when she 's dead if you can . " She snorted . " Even a dwelf with less than half a brain can tell you that . " " What is the second condition ? " asked Patience . " The first gebling king , " said Reck . " He was Unwyrm 's brother . His memories of Unwyrm are in the stone . You must tell us what Unwyrm is . You must tell us everything about him that you can remember , when the mindstone is in place . " " So the Heptarchs remember Unwyrm , " she whispered . " They have known who the enemy is , all these years . " " Only the ones with courage enough to put it in their brains , " said Reck . " And strength enough to keep their sanity when they did , " said Ruin . Reck asked again , " Will you tell us ? " Patience nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the careful diplomat , she let Reck and Ruin see her fear . " Do you believe that I 'm truly strong enough to bear it ? " Ruin shrugged . " If you are n't , we 're no worse off than before . " She was still an animal to him . But Reck noticed her vulnerability this time , and answered with sympathy . " How many times has this been done in the history of the world ? How can we know how strong a human has to be , to hold geblings in her mind , and still remain human ? But I 'll tell you what I know of you . Many humans , most humans , cringe in their solitude , frightened and weak , struggling to bring into themselves as many things and people as they can . To own so much that they can feel large and believe , falsely , that they are not alone . But you . You are not afraid of your own voice in the dark . " Patience put the loop back in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The geblings visibly relaxed . " You said your name was Heffiji ? " asked Patience . " Yes . A scholar gave it to me once , long ago . I forget what my name was before that . If you ask me , I 'll tell you . " " A gaunt , was n't he ? The scholar who named you ? Heffiji is a Gauntish word . " " Yes , she was . Do you know what it means ? "  | " It 's a common word . It means never . ' Never what ? " " Mikias Mikuam Heffiji Ismar . " " Never to Lose the Finding Place . " " That 's me , " said Heffiji . " I do n't know anything , but I can find everything . Do you want to see ? " " Yes , " said Patience . " Yes , " said Reck . Ruin shrugged . Heffiji led them back into the rest of the house . Every room was lined with shelves . On the shelves , in no apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wood served as paperweights in the rooms where the glassless windows let in the wind . The whole house was a library of papers scattered in a meaningless order . " And you know where everything is ? " asked Reck . " Oh , no . I do n't know where anything is , unless you ask me a question . Then I remember where the answer is , because I remember where I set it down . " " So you ca n't lead us to anything unless we ask you " " But if you ask me , I can lead you to everything . " She smiled in pride . " I may have only half a brain , but I remember everything I ever did . All the Wise came by my house , and they all stopped and gave me every answer , and they all asked me every question . And if I did n't have the answer to their question , I kept asking others the same questionuntil one of them could answer it . " Patience started to lift a rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamed Heffiji . Patience set the rock back down . " If you move anything , how will I find it again ? " shouted the dwelf . " Anything you touch will be lost forever and ever and ever ! There are a hundred thousand papers in this house ! Do you have time to read it all , and remember where each scrap of it is ? " " No , " said Patience . " I 'm sorry . " ' Phis is my brain ! " shouted Heffiji . " I do with this what humans and geblings and gaunts do with your large heads ! I let you dwell in it because you will add to my memories . But if you move anything , you might as well burn down the house with me inside , because then I 'll be nothing but a dwelf with half a brain and no answers at all , none at all ! " She was weeping . Reck comforted her , the long , many-jointedp139fingers stroking the dwelf 's hair in a swirling pattern like a bird 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reck , " humans are like that , they stumble into other people 's houses and break and destroy without any thought of the havoc that they wreak . " Patience bore the abuse ; she had earned it . But Ruin took her silence to mean that she had n't got the point of Beck 's remark . " She means that you humans came to this world and ruined it for all of us who were here before you  --  geblings and dwelfs and gaunts . " Suddenly Heffiji was no longer weeping . She pulled away from Reck with a broad smile on her face . " It 's my best answer , " she said . " Ask me the question . " " What question ? " asked Ruin . " All of us who were here before you , " ' she said . " Ask me . " Ruin tried to decide what question she meant . " All right , who was here before the humans ? " Heffiji jumped up and down with delight . " Wyrms ! " she shouted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about geblings , then , if we were n't here when humans arrived ? " asked Reck . " What about them ? Too vague  --  you have to ask a better question than that . " " Where did geblings come from ? " she asked . Heffiji jumped up and down again . " My favorite , my favorite ! Come and I 'll show you ! Come and you 'll see ! " She led them up a ladderway into a low and musty attic . Even the geblings had to stoop ; Patience had to squat down and waddle along to the farthest corner . Heffiji gave her lantern to Ruin and took a sheaf of papers from a roof beam . She spread them along the attic floor . Taking back the lantern , she began to read the explanations of the drawings , one by one.  --  There is no such thing as a native life form left on this world , and no such thing as Earth life , either , except for human beings themselves , " she said . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the domesticated plants and animals came from Earth  --  " Ileffiji held the lantern up to his face . " If you already know all the answers , why did you stop at my house ? " Abashed , he fell silent.  |p140Heffiji  recited . " Comparing the genetic material of any plant or animalwith the records concerning similar plants or animals preserved from the knowledge brought with mankind from Earth , we find that the original genetic code is still preserved , almost perfectly  --  but as only a tiny part of a single but vastly larger genetic molecule . " Heffiji pointed to a diagram showing the positions of the Earth species ' protein patterns within the single chromosome of the present Imakulata version . " Clearly , the species brought from earth have been taken over or , as is more likely , imitated perfectly by native species that incorporate the genetic material into their own . Since the resulting molecule can theoreticallycontain hundreds of times as much genetic information as the original Earth species needed , the rest of the genetic material is availablefor other purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of adapting again and again to imitate and then replace any competing species . There is even a chance that the Imakulatagenetic molecule is complex enough to purposefully control alterationsin the genetic material of its own reproductive cells . But whether some rudimentary form of intelligence is present in the geneticmolecule or not , our experiments have proven conclusively that in two generations any Imakulata species can perfectly imitate any Earth species . In fact , the hnakulata imitation invariably improves on the Earth original , giving it a competitive edge  --  shorter gestation or germination times , for example , or markedly faster sexual maturity , or vastly increased numbers of offspring per generation . " Heffiji looked at them piercingly , one at a time . " Well ? " she asked . " Do you understand it ? " Patience remembered what Prince Prekeptor had once said to her . " The genetic molecule is the mirror of the will . " Heffiji scowled . " That 's religion . I keep those in the cellar . " " We understand , " said Ruin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , I 'll say it again . " They had no questions . Heffiji moved on to a series of drawings of wheat plants and a strange , winged insect . " Our experiments involved separating the original Earth-species geneticmaterial from common wheat , to see what was left when the currently dominant Earth-genes were gone . The experiments were delicate , and we failed many times , but at last we succeeded in separatingp141the genetic material , and growing Earth wheat and the species that had absorbed and replaced it . The genetic structure of the Earth wheat was identical to the records passed down to us from the original colonists , and yet when it grew we could see no difference in the plant itself from the Imakulata wheat . However , the leftover genetic material from the Imakulata wheat did not produce a plant at all . Instead , it produced a small insectlike flier , with a wormlike body except for three wing-pairs . It was completely unlike anything we could find in our catalogues from Earth , but possibly similar to what the earliest colony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappear from the first colony of Heptam after a few years . " " What does this have to do with geblings ? " asked Ruin . " I know more about plants than any human scientist ever did . " Heffiji glared at him . " Go away if you do n't want the answers that I give . " Reek touched her brother 's cheek . " It is n't that he does n't understand , " she said . " It 's that he already understands too well . " Heffiji went on . " We introduced a single Imakulata gnat into a glass box containing a sample of pure Earth wheat that was ready for fertilization . Without a mate , the Imakulata gnat soon began laying thousands of eggs . The wheat also ripened and dropped seed . But the Imakulata eggs hatched first . A few of them produced gnats , which began attacking each other savagely until only one was left . Most of the seeds , however , produced an incredible array of strange plants , many of them wheatlike , many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few grew more than a few centimeters in height before they died . Those that thrived , while they were generally somewhat wheatlike , were still easily distinguishable from the Earth species . By the time the next generation of Earth wheat germinated and grew , they had already gone to seed , and showed every sign of being new and vigorous species . We immediately began several other experiments to see if the results were identical . " On to the next drawing . " In the meantime , the sole surviving second-generation gnat mated , not with the new Imakulata species , but with the second generation Earth wheat . This time , most of the gnat 's offspring were similar to what we call wheat today  --  completely indistinguishable from Earth wheat , except for the presence of a single immense genetic molecule which contains all the genetic informationp142from the original Earth wheat . We repeated these results at will . When the second-generation gnat was allowed to reproduce with secondgeneration  --  oreven tenth- or twentieth-generation Earth wheat  --  the result was always outwardly identical Imakulata wheat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat or the new Imakulata plant species . In fact , the Imakulata wheat seemed particularly inimical to the new Imakulata nonwheat species . They were destroyed as if by poison within two generations . The Earth wheat sometimes lingered as long as six generations before being utterly replaced . However , when the second-generation gnat was not allowed to reproduce with later Earth wheat , the Imakulata wheat never appeared . Instead , the new Imakulata species and the Earth wheat continued to breed true to form , with no further cross-breeding between species . This process of complete replacement within two generations may have repeated itself many times with every Earth species brought with the colonists except , of course , humankind itself , which has shown no changes in its chromosomal patterns . " And that was all . " You never got to the geblings , " said Ruin triumphantly . " We asked you about geblings , but you never got to them . " Heffiji stalked off with the lantern . Of course they followed . But she did not lead them down the stairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . There were four drawings , each drawn and labeled by the same hand . One was labeled " Human Genetic Molecules . " The other three were labeled " humanlike sections " of gebling , dwelf , and gaunt genetic molecules . In each case , the human genetic patterns were all imbedded within a single long molecule , just as the Earth wheat patterns had been incorporated in the single genetic molecule of all the Imakulata plants . Heffiji could hardly contain her delight . " They did n't know it ! I was the one who put it together , I was the one who knew that both of these were the answers to the same question ! And when I saw humans and geblings together , I knew that you were the ones who needed to have this answer . " She grinned . " That 's why I cheated and gave hints . " " It is n't true ! " shouted Ruin . " We are not just failed copies of humans ! " He flung out his hand as if to throw Heffiji @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patience caught his arm before he could do it.  | " Are you trying to burn down this house ? " demanded Reck . " We are the original inhabitants of this world , and they are the interlopers ! We are not descended from humans ! They have usurped our world from us ! " Patience spoke to him quietly . " Ruin , you 're right . Even if half your heritage is human , the other half is not . The other half is native . To imitate us was part of your nature . Whatever your ancestors were beforehumans came to Imakulata , it was their nature to absorb and adapt . What you are today is the fulfillment of what your ancestors had to become , if they were to be true to themselves . " " And what were we before ? " asked Reck . The question was rhetorical . But again Heffiji ran off with the lantern , this time clattering down the ladder . They had no choice but to follow as she ran through the house , shouting , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They found her in the great room , where Will once again stood by the door , while Angel sat in the seat by the fire . Heffiji was holding a large paper , which contained four versions of the same drawing . She kept reciting the words written at the top of the page : " Most likely reconstruction of large segmented animals found at Rameling and Wissick sites . " It was a large wormlike animal with vestigial wings that fanned out just like geblings ' fingers , with a head as proportionately tiny as the head of a dwelf , and with a body as long and lithe as a gaunt . Its belly looked loose and open , as if loose sections of bowel were protruding . When Heffiji at last quieted down , Angel spoke softly from his place by the fire . " Wyrms , " he said . " The earliest colonists called them that , and killed them all , even though there was evidence that they lived communally and buried their dead . They were too frightening , they awakened too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Except one , " said Patience . " That 's what Unwyrm is , is n't he ? The last of the wyrms . " " Not quite , " said Ruin , who looked exhausted and defeated . " We geblings named him , did n't we ? Unwyrm . Not-wyrm . Not our father ; our brother . We did n't remember that he looked like this , did n't remember what a wyrm was . But now it 's clear enough . Just like the second-generation gnat that killed off the other gnats and waited to iiiatc again with the Earth wheat . That 's what Unwyrm is doing . Waitingto mate again with a human being . "  | " The seventh seventh seventh daughter , " murmured Angel . " I told you not to come . " " A new human species to replace the old , " said Reck . " And to destroythe others  --  gaunt , dwelf , and gebling . " " Why did he wait so long ? " asked Patience . " The gnat finished the process in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " Heffiji was crestfallen . " I do n't have the answer to everything , you know . "  |p145Ruin  carefully shaved Patience 's hair from behind the ear almost to the middle of the back of her head . " You 'll have to wear your wig now , " said Angel . " This new hairstyle might attract some attention . " Ruin chewed a leaf , then licked the shaved area with his rough tongue . He jabbed her skin many times with a dry needle . Patience did not feel it except as a tiny pressure  --  the nerves of pain had already gone numb . " I wo n't care how my hair looks , " she said . " I 'll be lucky if I come out of this remembering I 'm a girl . " She was trying to show her confidenceby joking , but she surprised herself by sounding frightened instead . " Or even a human . " Reck touched her hand . Patience vaguely remembered that only a month ago , if a gebling had touched her it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came as a comfort to her . Beware of liking her too much , she told herself . Beware of affection , the great deceiver . " Patience , " whispered Reck , " it is n't good if you are n't sure who youp146are . You 'll have the memories of hundreds of men and women in your mind when this is done . Some of them are very strong  --  especially the geblings . The gebling kings have always been very , very strong . " " I know who I am , " Patience whispered . But it was a lie . If she knew who she was it was a secret even from herself . A secret she would at last discover , she hoped . Having the mindstone would unfold her , back to what she was before she learned the roles assigned to her in life . If she was blank , if she was nothing but her roles , then the mindstone would fold her back again , and she would disappear in a storm of memories and selves long dead . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her by others , she would find her way out , she would keep control , she would survive . Either I am someone , and I 'll live , or I am no one , and my self dies . She felt Ruin lift a flap of her skin and pin it out of the way . From the grinding sound , he was cutting at her skull , but she felt no more than if her head were a slab of stone . He was a stonecutter , turning her own brain into a sort of heads hall , with all of the heads alive and staring down at her , yammering at once from their jars of gools and headworms . She shuddered . " Hold still , " murmured Ruin . Angel began a steady monologue to calm her . " Obviously , Patience , this information about Unwyrm and the origin of the geblings and dwelfs and gaunts was not discovered for the first time by whoever left these answers here . The prophecies themselves , the very name of Unwyrm , the traditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that Unwyrm is their brother  --  these all imply that this information has been known before , perhaps many times . " Ruin pried out a section of skull and set it on the table . It made a little clunking sound . " But knowledge comes and goes . For instance , what happened the first time a human and a gebling met ? Had the geblings already developed a language ? A society ? Or did they fashion their social patterns after those of human beings ? " Ruin held the tiny scepter in his hand . " This is my heritage , " he whispered . " No human being could have made this . It belongs to me and Reek , and you have no right to it . " For a moment Patience thought he was reneging on his agreement , that he would put it in his mouth , swallow it , and himself walk alongp147the brink of madness . She was relieved , for just a moment , not to have to do it herself . But then he set it at the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ordeal after all . His tongue pushed it through the small incision he had made , until it rested where he wanted it , exactly on the middle of her limbic node . Then he withdrew his tongue , licked a small dish covered with a fine powder , and reinserted it to smear the powder into place . " And another question that intrigues me , " said Angel , going on as if Ruin had not spoken , as if Patience were not now irrevocably committed to a journey that could destroy her . " How does the crystal relate to nonhuman intelligence ? The geblings , of course , have humanlike brains , but the dwelfs do n't . You all have the crystals , but the gaunts have no will , no sense of identity  --  the mindstones ca n't be the seat of personality . And you geblings , you and Unwyrm have in common your means of communication that transcends anything possible to human beings . And yet Unwyrm can use it to call to humans  --  there must be something in it that is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an ass when you try to talk like a scholar , " whispered Patience . Angel ignored her . " And the wyrm that originally called the Starship Captain  --  it had that same ability , and perhaps more . " Ruin spoke without looking up from his work . " No doubt the wyrms used their ability to lure their prey and repel their enemies . One wyrm used it with your Starship Captain , but no doubt it does n't depend on any intelligence on the part of the victim . " " And instead of eating the captain , they mated , " said " said Angel . " I wonder how much abasement a human being can bear , and still desire to live . " He sounded sad . " With his right hand he drew what the wyrm wanted him to draw , " whispered Patience . " With his left hand he warned us . He still had some part of his human will , even though the wyrm controlled most of his actions . " " Yes , a fragmentation , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will carried in the brain , created and shaped by memory , by experience . The conscious mind , the controllable mind , the mind of words . And part of the will carried  --  where ? In the genes ? Certainly the genes are the only part of us that has any hope of surviving our death  --  whatp148more appropriate place for a seat of a part of the unconscious mind ... " Patience 's vision suddenly focused . She had not realized it was blurred before . But it was not Angel speaking at all , it was old Mikail Nakos . Whose voice had she thought it was ? She could n't remember . Mikail , he was the one who had taken it upon himself to study these creatures , the geblings . I thought it could do no harm . But now he wants to implant this organic crystal in someone 's mind . He does n't understand the implications of it . " What if the crystals actually enhance human mental abilities , make it possible for human beings to communicate telepathically , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It might be possible . " It was her own voice , she knew , but not what she expected . For some reason she expected it to be a girl 's voice , trained to be mellifluous , soothing ; instead it was harsh , commanding , male . Why not male ? Am I not a man ? The Heptarch listened to himself , trying to remember why his own voice did n't sound right to him . " I suspect , though , that the telepathic communication has more to do with the molecules than the crystals . The crystal is more likely to be memory . Incredibly well-ordered , clear , and powerful memory . " He did not doubt his ability to converse intelligently with a brilliant scientist . But then the old Heptarchs had been scientists , in the beginning . But why am I calling him an old Heptarch ? It 's not me , then . Not really me talking , though I remember it as being myself . " I 'm guessing  --  but the little ones , you see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute perfection everything that they 've ever done , even though they ca n't hold an idea more complex than their name for very long . They store millions of items of data , but have no organizing principle . " " Not implausible , sir . Not at all . The crystal would be the data storage . The brain , the systematizer . But the telepathy  --  it might be in the crystal . " " I 'm not even sure I believe there is any telepathy . It 's only speculation . The geblings are certainly not telling , bless their murderous little viper souls . " " Still , sir , combined with a human brain , the crystal could provide a great enhancement of mental abilities . "  | " If it can combine . If it actually has anything to do with mentation . " " Difficult to answer . But the geblings are n't answering  --  and they probably do n't know , anyway . Ignorant little devils . " For some reason the Heptarch wanted to correct him . To tell him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought he knew geblings so well , so he said nothing . " You see , sir , if the geblings were n't so dangerous , so deadly , we might be able to leave it alone . But they 're cannibals  --  we saw how they eat each other 's brains  --  and they 've murdered almost a dozen of our people already . We have to understand all we can about them . What they want , where they come from  --  " " So you need a little white mouse to test the crystal . " " Unfortunately , it needs to be a highly intelligent white mouse . I intend to have it implanted in my own brain , sir . " " Nonsense . If you implant it in anyone , implant it in mc . " " You 're the Heptarch . I ca n't do that . " " I 'm the Heptarch , so you must do it . There is no duty so difficult or dangerous or unpleasant that one of my people can do it , and I can-not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who chose to have the mindstone placed in his brain . That was long ago , another person . But how could the crystal contain a memory of an event that obviously took place before the crystal was implanted ? No sooner had the question occurred to her than the answer came , a mother speaking to a daughter ; she was the mother and the daughter , hearing the conversation from both sides , speaking both sides of the conversation herself . It was confusing , but exhilarating . " When the scepter first enters your brain , it searches for your most potent memories and copies them and keeps them . " " You wo n't know my memories , will you ? " " No , darling , but you 'll know mine . You 'll know what I 'm thinking at this very moment , how much I love you , to give you this gift while I 'm still alive . " " I 'm afraid . " " " I'he first thing you think of is always our great ancestor , who first chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and part of him becomes part of you . " Why did n't Father help me , as this mother helped her daughter ?  |p150Then  she could n't remember who Father was , or who she was , except the mother , except the daughter . " You 're safe as long as you do n't think of certain things . " " What things ? " " If I tell you what they are , my foolish child , then how will you stop yourself from thinking of them ? " I know what they are , thought Patience . They are the gebling kings in whose brain the crystal first grew . They are the wyrm-hearted geblingkings that I must n't think of . And that very thought brought her to the memories most to be feared , a terrible alien viewpoint . She knew at once that she had taken the step into the abyss . She could feel a faint buzz of feeling , like peripheral vision , like background noise , like a metallic taste in her mouth , like a smell redolent of sweet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies upon her skin ; gradually she realized , as the gebling whose mind now dwelt in hers realized , that these were her brothers , her sisters , the life of them speaking to the firstborn , the gebling king , myself . The other geblings are still tearing their way out of their soft-skinned shells , their hair curled and matted . I am curled by my mother 's exhaustedbody , her black segments trembling from her labors . Beside me lies my father , his poor , weak , hairless body covered with sweat . Come to me , Father , open my mouth " Full-grown . Whatever it is , it 's no baby . " The voice is soft . " Have n't you heard of babies around here ? " His mouth moves and the sounds are beautiful . Teach me how to make these sounds . Father 's face is twisted as he looks at me . " Full-grown little apes . " He touches me . He pushes me . " You brought me here so you could give birth to these ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Black like Mother . The tiny tiny head like Mother . It 's hungry . I can feel it being hungry . It wants to kill Father . It wants to kill me . It wants to kill everybody and eat all the world . Father taught me what to do . Already he saved me . Father taught me pushing . I push the black one , I push him but he hurts me very much . I cry out with my fear . Mother , help me . Father , save me . I hear a terrible frightened sound and it is my own sound coming out of my own mouth like Father . I scream and scream  |p151They  fight , Mother and the black one . Father is shouting and shouting " Stay here and die , all of you stay and for God 's sake eat each other ! " The sound of his voice says fear and I am also afraid . Father goes through a hole in the wall of the birthing place . Father knows the way . Father we are coming ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they hear me with their othermind . I go and so all the others go , all those who look like me , and some of the littler ones and taller ones , all who can move , all who do not writhe on the ground dying because their bodies do n't work . We cry out to him We 're coming , Father , but he does n't hear us because we do n't make a sound and in the silence he is deaf . I see it in his eyes when he looks at us , he does n't understandour cries , he only hears our screaming . Behind us the black one that looks like Mother is eating her belly out and he will eat us all if he can . Hungry , hungry , he pushes his hunger out into all of us , Come to me , says his hunger , come and fill me , and I can feel my brothers and sisters yielding to him , stopping , going back toward the birthing place . No ! I cry ! No ! Come with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone to come with Father . And the strongest ones take up my call , they call also , Come with Father , and we are stronger as we call together , stronger and stronger until we have overcome the Mother-eater 's hunger . Down into the black tunnel , all of us in the black tunnel , where are you , Father ? Where are you ? I see you , bright sisters and brothers , I feel your path in the darkness , I know where you are , every one of you , in so many different tunnels . From Father 's footsteps splashing ahead of me I know the path outward . Follow the water . Follow the running water . It goes away from the birthing place , follow the waterPatience cried out with joy as she saw the light of the world for the first time . From a cavern 's mouth in the face of a high cliff she looked down on a vast forest , with the heads of the River Cranwater joining to form a single river flowing away from Skyfoot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember being the first geblingking , feeling the presence of every other gebling as each came out of his or her own tunnel to find the sky , the water leaping out from each cavern mouth . Again she saw through the gebling 's eyes . We all stand here , looking at the bright light , like-me and bigger andp152littler , I can feel us all here at the edge of the world . And beside me is Father , I have found him , there is water on his face . " I sold my soul for you , " he says . " All I wanted was that wyrm back there . How could I want her . " He shudders . " It was eating her . What kind of monsters  --  " I try to feel him , too , like I can feel all the others , but he is n't there , my eyes see him , my nose smells him , but my othermind ca n't find him . I touch his cheek and taste the water on his face . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sees my tongue and wrinkles his face . Then he reaches to me and touches my cheek and his mouth says , " You 're not a wyrm , though , are you ? It 's not your fault , is it . " Then he stands and takes my hand and leads me to the edge and holds out his hand to point to the bright blue dazzle that blinds me and all the children of man and wyrm . " Sky , " he says . " Sick . I. " I speak . I am like him , not like Mother . She was eaten by the wyrm in the birthing place , but Father lives and I am like him . " Born an hour ago , and already you can talk . What have I made here ? What can you become ? " Patience watched the time flow faster . The babies born , the Starship Captain teaching them everything . To build houses , to hunt for food , to tend their children and teach them . Language came easily , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once they had done it a single time . They invented their own words faster than Father could teach them , until they hardly came to him for learning anymore . The gebling king , who never had a name for himself , he came to Father often . " Wyrm , " Father said . " Your mother is the wyrm , and I am your father , but most important of all is the monster that ate your mother and drove us from the birthing place . He looks like a wyrm but he is n't a wyrm . He 's your brother and he 'll kill you all if he can , and if he ever comes out of the mountain you must kill him first . " So the gebling king was the first gebling who learned to kill , and heusedthe secret knowledge of murder just as human beings had used it from the start  --  to gather power to himself . I have the terrible secret . I can kill you if you disobey . But if you obey me , I can share the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerUntil Father says one day , when he finds me covered with blood , " I wish Unwyrm had killed you that day in the birthing place , I wish hep153had killed me and eaten me rather than let me live to make you what you are . I 'm sorry that I taught you , any of you . " So I kill him and eat his brain in front of the others , even though I find no mindstone in it ; I do n't tell them that he had no stone . And now my power is perfect , even greater than Unwyrm 's power , because he has no one to obey him and I have all of these . Patience screamed at the memory , at the taste and smell of Father 's blood , at the look of horror and awe and admiration in the other geblings ' eyes . I could n't do this , I never could have done this , she cried out in revulsion . And yet this is what I was raised for , to kill in order to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my will " It 's maddening her , " said Angel . " Give her time to find herself , " said Reek . The voices meant nothing to Patience . For all she could see was the bloodshed through the years . The murders of the gebling kings , the murders of the Heptarchs . Wars and assasinations , tortures and rapes , she remembered committing all the crimes of seven thousand years of power and she hated herself for all that she had doneNothing in my life except death and terror , she thought . And then her own mother 's face ( or was it her mother ? She had three hundred mothers ) smiling at her , touching her , saying , " Broken heart , do n't cry . Do n't cry at the things that have been done in your name . For every life that was taken , there were ten thousand who lived in peace with your protection . Do you think your power would last for a moment if all you had was the power to kill ? They would rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw them together , to make them act as one . You have made the weak strong by the sound of your voice , and they love you forever . " Patience clung to the message of that voice . I have made the weak strong by the sound of my voice . They love me forever . And at last , having found a thread to cling to so she would not fall into the abyss , she slept.  |p154She  awoke lying in a bed , covered with three featherbeds . A cold breeze from a broken window whipped past her face . The trees outside the window were golden with autumn . Are you really the trees of Earth ? she asked them silently . Or are you strange alien creatures that have captured the trees and hidden them deep inside , so you can wear their mask ? She thought of all the children she had ever had in her hundreds of lives , pictured them smiling up at her , good children every one ; but then something dark , a dark worm crawled into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the wyrm with the tiny head and the fanlike fingers  --  not a wing at all  --  and the hundred fleshy organs of tearing and digesting and reproducing  --  Unwyrm , do you know the difference between eating and mating ? Or is there a difference to you ? All hungers are the same hunger . She opened her eyes . She saw him before she saw anything else , standing there half lit by the dim autumnal light through the window . Will . His face watching her in his utter silence , his unreadable stolidness , like an animal ; or no , like a mountain , like the face of living rock . Why are you watching me ?  |p155She  did not speak ; he did not answer . He only noticed that her eyes were open , nodded , and walked from the room . He closed the door gently behind him . It was the tenderness , the gentleness of the closing of the door that told her that he was not , after all , made of stone . It was n't lifelessness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his peace with life , and so his face had no more to say , no silent pleas to make between speeches , and his mind had no speeches to make betweensilences . He is n't hungry . He is already satisfied . And as she thought of hunger , she felt again the Cranning call , as powerful as ever , gnawing at her womb . I am hungry to have his babies , she thought . It came to her as the memory of a hundred nightmaresduring the time she slept . He will make me hungry for his seed in me , just as his mother made the Starship Captain yearn for her . He will make me think that it is ecstasy . She shuddered . But now that she had dreamed Unwyrm a hundred times , his writhing as he devoured his mother and slaughtered his helpless deformed brothers , now that it was so familiar to her it did not make her lose control of'herself and scream , as she had done in all the dreams . She was too tired of it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see to it that it does n't happen , that 's all . He 'll die before he has me , or I 'll die . His children will not be born from my body . But even if I live , will I ever want a man as I want Unwyrm ? What if he dies while still calling me ? Will that need be with me then forever , always unsatisfied ? Thoughts like that made her angry with herself . She sat up , swingingher legs over the edge of the bed . At once she was almost overcome with dizziness . The door to her room opened , and Angel came in . Angel , looking strong and healthy , no longer weak from the wound in his throat . " Your wound has healed and the trees have turned colors , " she said . " How long have I slept ? " " Forty days and forty nights , like Moses in the mount , like the rain of the deluge , like Elijah fasting in the wilderness . If you can call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept us all awake . Even River has complained that you frighten his monkey . How are you ? " She reached up and touched the side of her head that Ruin had shaved . The hair had grown several centimeters . " Weak , " she said . " Unwyrm is calling me . " " We were afraid the scepter was too much for you . "  | " It was n't the scepter , really . It was all the terrible things I had done . " " You did n't do any of them . " " But I did , Angel . No , do n't argue with me . I did n't kill my own father and eat his brain , the way the first gebling king did , or kill my own wife , as my father did . But I have killed . Obeying you or father , or to save my own life , I have killed easily , with pleasure , with pride . That made it hard for me to  --  separate myself from all their crimes . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to life throughout my past , Angel . A hope that it all works together for good . That out of the blood I 've poured into the ground , life can grow again . " " Many people who 've just awakened from a sound sleep think they 're philosophers , " Angel said . " Do n't make fun of me , " said Patience . " This is important . This is my  --  my contribution to the scepter , if I have one to make . All the children will look to me , gebling children and human children , they all will look to me and I have to keep them safe . From Unwyrm 's children . And yet sometimes I think  --  Unwyrm 's children would not be murderers . They would all be bound together with one heart and mind , the way the wyrms were before the coming of humans to this world . Before human genes made us strangers to each other . Unwyrm 's children would never be alone . And I could be their mother . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's just that I finally understood the thought he sends to me , Angel . I know what Unwyrm did to his own mother . He 's the devourer , not me . I 'll kill him if I can . " But she knew she did n't sound convincing . It did n't matter , though . It was n't Angel she had to convince , it was herself . " He is a wyrm , then ? A descendant of the ones the first colonists killed ? " " He is the Unwyrm , Angel . The very one . The only one . Alive for all seven thousand years of the world 's history . " " To live so long  --  " " We 're strangers here . The native life can adapt itself , make changes in a single generation that we take a million years to make . Unwyrm is more intelligent than all of them . In him are combined the most powerfulof the native gifts , and he called the most brilliant of humanp157minds , and they must have taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from repairing himself genetically , when he finds any part of him becoming weak , decaying ? What 's to stop him from living until he 's ready to mate ? " " Why would he wait so long ? " " I do n't know . I only know how humans looked to the first geblings . The machines that let our ancestors fly , that made pictures in the air , that chewed up forests and spat out wheatfields . What did the wyrms see , when a new star appeared in the sky and metal birds skittered above the surface of the world ? They were n't gnats , replacing safe and stationary wheat . They were at the peak of the ecological system , these wyrms , but we were more powerful than they . And if they were to replace us  --  " " They had to know all that we knew . " " The wheat sits there , passively waiting for its enemy to destroy it . But the wyrms knew that human beings were n't passive . We were the most deadly competitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lb overpowerus , the wyrms ' grandchildren not only had to be identical to human beings  --  they had to excel at the things that human beings do best . They had to know more , to be more beautiful , more brilliant , more powerful , more dangerous . How could a single wyrmchild , Unwyrm , hiding in his ice cave in Skyfoot , how could he learn enough to prepare his children ? " " An ice cave ? That means he 's high in the mountain , where the glaciers are . " " Do n't you understand , Angel ? He could n't defeat us if we built machines . The wyrms knew it from the start . When they captured the Starship Captain , before they even brought him down , they first made him destroy all the metal that was easy to mine . But there was still metal  --  I remember my ancestors who pursued it , who mined it , who tried to build machines with it . They might have succeeded . But always the geblings came , a flood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar with the history of the world . " " Angel ! I 'm telling you what no one ever knew . I 'm telling you the why of it . I 've seen the pattern in it , remembering it all at once like this . Unwyrm sent the geblings to stop mankind from making the machinesthat would have made us irresistible . He waited all this time to keep us weak while he gathered wisdom to himself . He gave himselfp158seven thousand years . And then fulfilled his own prophecy by causing my brothers to be killed and me to be  --  " He touched her head gently , to soothe her . His hand felt cool and loving on her forehead , on her cheek . " River tells us that Cranning is only a week away , and the autumn winds are strong for getting there . But we have to go now . The winter winds will beat us back . It 's good you came to yourself today  --  we 'll bring you to Cranning in your right mind . " There was an artificiality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't in what he said , and she could n't think why he was lying to her . But that was no surprise , she could hardly think at all . So she let it go , did n't try to discover what it was he was concealing . " Tell Reck and Ruin that I also know the map of Cranning . " " They know you do . You 've told us much in your sleep . We 've been writing down the stories you shouted out , and Heffiji has been storing them away here and there . I 've tried to figure out what her system is . " " She does n't have one . " " That was my conclusion . A true dwelf . But no one else could have done this . Unwyrm was calling all the people who knew things . He would have called her , too , if she had actually known anything . The only way the knowledge could stay in the world was with someone like Heffiji who knew nothing of any value , but could lay her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the learning of the world . Reck and Ruin have called geblings out of Cranning to guard the place . They 're going to glaze and shutter the windows , put on a new roof . Whatever it takes to protect this house . " " Do the geblings accept Reck and Ruin as their king ? " Angel shrugged . " Who knows what goes on in their minds ? They say one thing , but something completely different might be going on under the surface . The fact remains that for the time being , these kings ca n't go more than a few dozen meters away from you , or they start being driven away from Cranning by Unwyrm . They ca n't exactly claim their right to lead the geblings while they 're still chained to the human Heptarch , can they ? " " We 've wasted enough time , " Patience said . " Take me to the boat . " " We 'll go as far as Cranning , but no deeper into the mountain until you 're stronger . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Crazy people can be amazingly strong . "  | " Is the call  --  any different now ? " " Only because I know who it is that 's calling me . " " So he does n't control you  --  " " Or if he does , he controls me so thoroughly that I do n't know I 'm controlled . " " That puts my mind at ease . " " Angel , I 've become a terrible person . " " Have you ? " " If the scepter had been given to me before I knew the things we learned here in this house , I could never have coped with it . If I had been brought to Cranning without understanding all the things I understand , I would have been helpless when I faced him . I look back on all that you and father did , all that I did and the geblings did and  --  it was right , it was necessary . " " Why does that make you terrible ? " " Even Mother 's death , Angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What kind of person am I , to agree that my own mother had to die ? I have lived through that so many times , all my life , only this time through Father 's eyes . He never forgave himself for it . Yet I forgive him . " Angel bent down and kissed her forehead . " My Heptarch , only you are fit to rule mankind . " " What kind of person am I ? " " A wise one . " She did n't argue , though she knew it was n't true . Wise she was not . But strong  --  she was strong . She had mastered the mindstone . There was a true self before all the folds of her life . She knew that much , but the rest of her self was still elusive , out of reach , out of sight . So let Angel call her wise , she cared nothing for that . " But am I good , Angel ? " " As Heptarch , your choice is no longer between good and bad . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been his student long enough to understand the difference , and agree that he was right . At least in her role as Heptarch , she could no longer live by the same moral code that others lived by . Her decisionsnow were the decisions of a larger community than just herself . But what community ? " Right for whom ? " she asked . " For humankind , Heptarch. "  |p160She  knew at once that he was wrong . " No . The King 's House is all the world . I am a gebling , too . All the life that speaks , and all the life that does n't speak , all the life of the world except one . " " And that one wants you . But I 'll die before I let him have you . He thinks I 'm too weak to save you , but I can , and I will . " His fervor as he spoke was no pretense . Whatever lies he was telling , this was not part of it . He did love her . She touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Angel . " " Slave or free , I serve you the same . What difference does it make ? " " I ask you now , as a free man , to help me . " Angel gently dressed her and led her from the room . To her surprise , the house was busy with geblings , hundreds of them . Her room had been off limits to them , but through the rest of the house they were busy glazing , patching , repairing , making it whole again . Patience sat in the common room by a scant fire , a fall of sunlight catching her chair to help keep her warm , and watched the ladders going up and down , moving along the walls , the geblings scatteringhere and there . River 's monkey scampered underfoot  --  a dozen times he was kicked , nearly stepped on , or knocked off some high perch . Always he got up , screeched a string of unintelligible obscenities , and bounded back into the thick of the fray . Patience could not help but notice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight and worry , scurrying in and out of the house , up and down the stairs . " Do n't touch that ! " she 'd cry . The geblings would laugh and mock her , but they would also obey . In his jar on the mantlepiece , River slept . Away from Cranwater , the world did not exist for him . Patience found herself trying to feel the geblings ' silent communication , the speechless call of the othermind . She remembered so clearly how it felt , when she was each of the first few gebling kings . Yet now she felt nothing . It was like reaching out with her hand , only to discoverthat her hand had been cut off . She watched them wistfully , grieving that she could never know them except in the vicarious memoriesthat came to her through the scepter . And the geblings went about their business , not knowing who she was , not guessing that she was the one living human who knew what it was like to be a gebling , who could understand the constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did I find the courage to live before , when I never knew what it was to know another person ?  | " Patience , " whispered someone behind her . She knew the voice , knew that Reck 's hand was reaching for her shoulder , and reached up her own hand to touch . And yes , it was there , the soft fur of the gebling hand . For a moment she thought that perhaps she had felt Reck 's proximity through the othermind . But no ; it could only be her instinct as an assassin , to know when a hand was reaching for her . She could not hope ever to take part in the gebling community . " Reck , " she said . " We were afraid we 'd carry a madwoman with us into Cranning . " " A madwoman should stay here . After all , this is a madhouse . " Reck laughed . " Not really . These geblings came to rebuild Heffiji 's house , to keep the learning of humankind safe . " " How did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king is known . Not by face or name  --  no , when they see us here they think we 're just two more geblings who were summoned and came . But in the othermind , they know the call of the gebling king . " " Do they come from Cranning ? " " I do n't think so . We called , and the nearest geblings heard it and passed on the call . As more and more took it up , it got stronger , until we knew we had enough . We 're not Unwyrm . Our own call , alone , could never reach from here to Cranning . " " It 's good of you to keep this house alive . " " This house has done the impossible . It has humbled my beloved brother Ruin . All the ideas that Heffiji has saved here . Ruin 's made a pest of himself , questioning her , dogging her heels from answer to answer . He 's hardly known a human in his life , and for obvious reason she 's never known any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what human minds can do at their best . " " If he ever wants to know us at our worst , he has only to take the scepter , " said Patience . " Not likely , " said Reck . " We used to pity you humans for your solitude . Well , I pitied you , and he despised you . But now , well , he keeps telling me that solitude is the foundation of true wisdom , that all the brilliant thoughts in this house come as the desperate cry of one human being to another , saying , Know me , live with me in the world of my mind . " " It 's a very poetic thought . " " I told him he 's lovesick  --  he 's fallen in love with the human race.  |p162But  you know how it is . I 've never hated humans the way he has , and so I 'm not quite so impressed when I find out that not all humans are worthless . " Reck walked to the chair on the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patience . " I kept dreaming about houses . Different houses that I needed to take care of . Sometimes Heffiji 's house and sometimes my father 's house , and sometimes Heptagon House . Sometimesthe house where my mother was killed . " Reck looked thoughtful . There were footsteps on the stair . Ruin padded into the room . Patience noticed at once that he was no longer naked . He wore short trousers . A step toward accepting human civilization . " Why did you call me ? " he asked . Reck turned to him , beckoned him closer . There was no one else in the room , but still it was better not to talk too loudly , not when they were saying things that could reveal who they were before they wanted to . " She heard our call , " said Reck . Ruin looked at Patience , as if analyzing a strange new herb he had just noticed on the forest floor . " The need to come fix a very important house ? And where it was ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where to . But always in the distance I could see the house burning , and I knew I had to hurryReck shook her head . " There was nothing about fire in our call . " " We do n't even see images , " added Ruin . " The othermind is n't that precise . " But Patience was excited at the thought that she might have experiencedthe gebling othermind in her own body . She would n't let these small objections disprove it . " I 'm not a gebling , and my brain may translate things into images that I can understand . I may be more of a gebling than you think . I remember the othermind . I remember feelingall the other geblings , and the map of Cranning . And besides , I have the scepter now . Maybe that lets me feel your call . " Reck stroked her tongue with the long nail of her thumb . " No , " she said . " Heptarchs have borne the mindstone before , but they have never heard the call of the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying Patience 's face . " If it is n't the mindstone , then perhaps Unwyrm 's call has made her more sensitive , so she hears what no human could hear before . " Reck raised a finger . " Remember , though . No Heptarch has everp163worn the mindstone so close to Cranning . When the other geblings took up the call , to pass it on , perhaps it grew strong enough for her to hear . " " It was nothing like Unwyrm 's call , " said Patience . " That is so clear and powerful . " " Unwyrm is much better at it than we are . Our human nature . It weakens us . " Reck sounded a little resentful . " Do you wish that you had no human parent ? " Reck laughed bitterly . " Do you think the wyrms look any prettier to us ? Nobody gave us a choice of ancestors . " " I saw it , " said Patience . And she told them of the birth of the first geblings . Ruin made her slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes closed , as if by concentrating on the sound of her choice he could conjure up the memories that the geblings had lost forever when they lost the mindstone of the kings . When Patience told how the infant Unwyrm killed his mother , Ruin nodded . " Yes , yes , " he said . " It was n't murder . He had to eat the crystal , you see . To know all that she knew . " " We 're more discreet now , " said Reck . " We 're more human . We wait until our parents die naturally . It means we have more life on our own before becoming our parents . But there 's nothing unnatural about a child eating its parent 's memory , not on Imakulata . " Patience went on with the story , with all she could remember of the life of the first geblings . And ended when the last of the gebling kings to bear this mindstone found the corpse of the last living wyrm . Humans had burned it to death . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frightening , kill it . The human credo . " " Humans do what they have to do , " said Ruin . Reek grinned wickedlyand winked at Patience , as if to say , See how my brother has become a humanophile ! " The wyrms did what they had to do , " said Ruin . " They knew the humans could and would kill them all , with their machines . What do you do when the enemy is too strong to destroy ? You become the enemy . " " Oh , yes , everybody 's doing what their genes tell them to do , " said Patience . " If they had n't chosen to mate with humans , " said Reck , " we would n't exist . We can hardly condemn the choice they made . " " But you see , Heptarch , we geblings are not what they decided top164become , " said Ruin . " We 're the castoffs of the second generation , the failed experiments , the doomed hybrids , the pitiful grotesques . Dwelfs with no brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came close . But not a perfect match . It 's the next generation that will be the perfect match , while we are meant to die . " " It 's not as if anyone planned it , " said Patience . " It 's he way life evolved here on Imakulata . " " When you put it that way , " said Reck , " it makes you want to bound up to Unwyrm and have his babies , does n't it ? " " With all due respect to the wisdom of our most ancient forebears , " said Ruin , " the gebling king has decided not to go along with the plan . " " We are wyrm enough to feel the life of every other gebling , " said Reck , " and human enough to have an individual will to survive . As far as we 're concerned , the adaptive process went far enough when it producedus and the gaunts and dwelfs . " " We are the heirs of the wyrms , " said Ruin . " Different from humans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genes of the wyrms are best preserved in us . Not in the perfect copy that Unwyrm means to make . " " We are allies in this war , " said Patience . Impulsively she slid from her chair , sat on the floor before the fire , leaning against Reck 's legs , her head resting on the gebling 's knee . " I remember living gebling lives . I want you to survive as much as I want human beings to live . " Reck stroked her hair . " I have come to know you as I 've known no other human being but one . I would regret it if the only way to stop Unwyrm were to kill you , too . " " But you would do it , " said Patience . " If there be no other way , I will . " " And if there be no other way , " said Patience , " I want you to . " She happened , as she said it , to look back to the door . Angel stood there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look on Angel 's face said that he had overheard their conversation and that he would not consent to Patience 's death . And for the first time it occurred to Patience that Angel might have no intention of obeying her when it came to the final battle with Unwyrm . Angel had his own plans , and however much he might call her Heptarch , he still thought of her as a child under his tutelage.  |p165A  chill swept over Patience as she thought , What if I have to kill you , Angel , in order to do what I must do ? He could not have seen what she thought in the expression of her face , but weak as she was she could not hide the shudder . He saw it . Wordlessly he went back outside , closing the door behind him . If Reck and Ruin noticed the momentary byplay , they did not comment on it . Perhaps it was because Reck felt her shudder that she asked , " Are you strong enough to go on ? " " What strength does it take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think , and so we can go as soon as the work here is finished . " " Then we can go now . There 's no need to wait here for the house to be done . It will be finished whether we 're here or not . Besides , we can supervise it , in a general sort of way , without being here at all . " Reck got up . " Wait , " said Patience . " I wanted to ask you . Will . He was watching at the foot of my bed when I woke up . " Reck shrugged . " Will does what he wants . " " How long had he been there ? " " I do n't know . Whenever I 've noticed him , he was either coming from or going to your room . " Ruin chuckled . " He 's a human male , after all , and you only came out of your boy disguise when I operated on you . Perhaps he likes looking at you . He 's been celibate for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to think of Will perhaps desiring her as a woman . Then she realized Ruin was joking . She laughed . " Do n't laugh , " said Reck . " I gave up trying to decipher Will 's mind long ago , however , so my guess is almost worthless . He does what he wants . But I doubt he thought of having you , Child . I 've never seen him want anything for himself . His life is nothing but service . " " A natural slave , " said Ruin . " No one could ever own him , " said Reck . " He serves , but only where he thinks service is needed . I think that secretly he believes he 's Kristos . Is n't that what the human god is supposed to be ? The servant of all ? " " I 'm a Skeptic , " said Patience . " I do n't pay attention to religion . " " Well , like it or not , religion pays attention to you , " said Reck . " Ifp166you come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't claim you 're the Kristos . " " She 's as good a choice as anyone , " said Ruin . " Or why not you ? " said Patience . " That would stand them on their ear , to have a gebling savior . " Ruin laughed . " Why not ? The goblin Kristos . " Patience laughed with him . As she did , she felt the Cranning call strengthen within her , as if it had been holding back , during her long madness , but had now awakened with the sound of her laughter . Lust for Unwyrm burned within her . She called for Sken , and Sken and Will readied the boat that afternoon . And in the morning , Patience herself took River 's jar from the mantlepiece . " Wake up , " she said to him . He slowly opened his eyes , then clicked twice and made a kissing sound . The monkey scampered into the room almost at once , and began pumping the bellows frantically . " About time , " River said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had them save my head for , to watch while a bunch of goblins redecorate a du116sh house ? Get me down to the boat , and you may rest assured that I 'll remember this as the worst , the stupidest voyage of my life ! " He scolded all the way down the hill . Only the rocking of the boat in the water stilled him ; then he sang the most curious song to the river , a song without words , without even much of a melody . The song of a man returned to his body at last , the ecstasy of once again wearing his own arms and legs , of once again being himself . River restored to the river . They cast off from Heffiji 's ramshackle dock and sailed north on the last of the autumn wind . Patience could feel Unwyrm rejoicing that she was coming to him once again . This month of waiting must have been hard for him , not knowing what it was that kept her , not knowing if she was injured , or had gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now she was coming to him once again , and he made her body tremble with the pleasure of it.  |p167Patience  knew that the scenery upriver of Heffiji 's house was identical to the scenery they had already passed . The same massive oaks , the same beech and maple , ash and pine . But she knew more now . She was more . She could remember some of the earliest Heptarchs as little children , learning long catalogues of flora and fauna , all neatly split between native and Earthborn . Oak and maple are Earthborn , so are ash and pine . Beech and palm and fern are native , but were named for similar Earth species . Scrubnut , hotberry , glassfruit , and web are native ; walnut is from Earth . Like many of her earliest ancestors , Patience now saw clear divisions between Imakulata 's native life and the life brought in the starship , and she began to understand the origin of the ancient enmity between humans and the intelligent natives they despised . They were ugly , strange , dangerous from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had brought with them were safe and beautiful . Yet Patience could also see what none of her ancestors had seen . Even though she could remember the world as it was seen by the fifth Heptarch , she had no memory of an alien world . The forests of Ima/kulata , by the fifth generation , had become exactly as they were today , almost entirely Earthborn . And yet not Earthborn at all . The native species had not been replaced . They had merely put on disguises and become , in appearance , the Earthborn plants that the humans nurtured . What was the oak before ? A little flying bug , a worm , a seaweed , an airborne virus on a fleck of dust ? The whole world was in disguise , every living thing pretending to be homely and comfortable for the humans who supposedthemselves masters of the world . Everything that truly belonged to human beings had been kidnapped , murdered , and replaced with mocks and moles . Patience imagined she could see through the disguiseof the deer that drank at water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She pictured the secret self of an oak as a hideous , deformed baby leering wickedly at her from the heart of the tree . Changelings , a world of changelings , all conspiring against us , lulling us into complacency , until the moment that they finally begin to replaceus , too . She shuddered . And she imagined that Unwyrm whispered to her with the desires of her body . Come to me , come and bear my children , my children , my changelings , we 'll steal into every house in the world , you and I , and creep to the children 's beds . We 'll lay our little wyrmlinginto the cradle , and watch as it changes shapes to look just like the human baby lying there . Then we 'll take the human baby , carry it outside , slit its throat and toss it in my bag . A thousand bags , each emptied into a garden , where the leering oaks suck the last dregs of life from the dessicated flesh . Patience thought she walked through the garden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband emptied another bag , then looked at her with his tiny wyrm 's head and said , " The last . That 's the last of them . There 's only one human child left in all the world . " He took a living baby out of his bag , its terrified eyes looking hopelessly up at her , and graciously offered to let her dine . Instead , she ran away , to a place where the ground was soft and forgiving to her feet ; to a small hut in the forest , where she could hear a mother crooning to her child . Here is a place we missed , she thought . A child that lives on . I 'll protect it , I 'll hide it from Unwyrm , and he 'll grow up and thrive and kill the changelingsShe peered into the window and saw the baby , and he was beautiful ,  |p169his  delicate fingers wrapped around his mother 's thumb , his mouth making sweet sucking motions . Live , she said silently to the child . Live and be strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winked at her and leered . Angel shook her awake . " You screamed , " he said . " Sorry , " she whispered . She held to the gunnel and looked across the water at the trees . None of them seemed any different . Her dream had been nonsense . If it looks like an oak , if it cuts like an oak , if you can build with it like an oak , what does it matter that it has one immense genetic molecule , instead of many small ones ? What does it matter if the deer is only half deer , and the other half of its bloodline is some strange creature of Imakulata ? Life is life , form is form . Except my life . My form . That must be preserved . Unwyrm 's improvedversion of humanity is the death of the old , flawed , lonely , but beautiful Earthborn people . My people . Come , hurry , hurry , come , spoke Unwyrm 's passion . " Look , " said Angel . " River sent Ruin up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the river . Skyfoot . For a few minutes , we can see it even from the deck . " Patience got up . Despite what she 'd been through on this journey , her body still responded quickly . She was alert and strong in a moment . My body does n't know I 'm three hundred generations old , she thought . My body thinks that I 'm a young woman . My body still thinks I have a future of my own . Skyfoot was a shadow just topping the distant trees on a long , straight stretch of river . " If the forest were n't so tall , " said Angel , " we would have seen it a week before we reached Heffiji 's house , instead of three days after leavingit . " " It 's very close , " said Patience . " Not really . Just very high . Seven kilometers from base to ridge . " " And now hidden again . " It was too brief a glimpse , and too far away to make out any features . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Two days later they dropped anchor in another bend , and as the dusk hid the mountainitself , the lights of Cranning began to dot the sky like a low-hung galaxy . The lights went as far from east to west as they could see throughp170their alley between the shores of tall timber . That night Reck and Ruin climbed the rigging in the darkness , to perch together on the mast and watch their patrimony come alive with light . River grew surly . Cranning meant nothing to him but the end of the voyage . It was the journey that he lived for , and each arrival was like a little death . The next day the river began to break up into many wide and slowflowingstreams passing among wooded islands . " What we have here , " said Angel , " is an ancient tectonic collision of massive proportions . We are on a plate that once was sliding down under the huge upthrust of Skyfoot . Now the two have joined , and the ground is stable , but once there must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls toward the base of Skyfoot . The water from the melting glaciers atop the mountain piles up in the sunken area , making a lake that runs along the entire base of the mountain . The original colonists saw it and wrote that there was nothing like it on any habitable planet in the universe . " " So far , " said Patience . " Well , one assumes that anything that can happen once , can and will happen again , eventually , on some other world . " They could make out clusters of buildings on the mountain 's face now . All day Ruin clung to the mast or sat in the bow , rapt , watching the face of the mountain as though it were a beloved supplicant coming to him . " He 's useless to anyone , " Sken complained . " We ought to tie a rope on him and throw him overboard as an anchor . " Reck 's reaction to the mountain was the opposite of Ruin 's . While he grew silent , she became talkative . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " The soil and water of the ten thousand cavern mouths of Cranning are so rich that never a stick of wood or morsel of food has ever been imported here . The foot of Cranning is a moist and humid rain forest . The mountain rises through all the weathers of the world . Anything that can live and grow anywhere in the world grows here . " She told of the kingdoms of men that had risen and fallen on the mountain 's face , some of them only three kilometers wide , fifty meters deep , and twenty meters high , yet with their own dialects , armies , cultures . " And behind them all , in the deepest caverns , in utter dark/ness , we geblings carry on our lives . Ten million geblings , more than half the geblings in the world . While men and dwelfs and gaunts have their wars and intrigues on the face of Skyfoot , we hold its heart . They build their boundaries and walls , so that none can pass  --  but the geblingspass , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you rule on the surface , too ? " asked Patience . " When we want to , " she said , smiling . " When we decide to rule , then we rule . Everyone there knows that . We do n't have to be officious about it . " Patience felt no rapture at the sight of the mountain . Somewhere near the top he was waiting for her , sensing her coming closer , getting more eager for her arrival . She found herself longing to turn the boat around , drift downstream and never think of Cranning or the Heptarchyor anything else again . She dreamed more often , and woke up sweating in the night , trembling from the desire that ruled her sleep . One such night she got up from her bed and left the cabin . Ruin was keeping his watch toward the bow , but she moved quietly and if he noticed her , he did not show any sign of it . He faced the mountain lights , now dying out one by one as the hour grew later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up beside a thick rope coiled on the deck . River was asleep in his jar , swaying gently as the current rocked the boat . The air was cold , but she liked the discomfort ; it distracted her from the Cranning call . She was n't aware of having been asleep , but when she opened her eyes , Ruin was not at the bow . Someone else 's watch , then . Whose turn was it ? There was no light yet in the sky . Sken ? Will ? She heard splashing in the water near the boat . Immediately she became alert . She knew all about the river pirates on the lower reaches of Cranwater ; she had never heard of any this near Skyfoot , but it was possible . She silently withdrew the glass blowgun from her cross and eased herself to a sitting position . The splashing moved along the port side of the boat , and sure enough , a hand reached up onto the gunnel . As the other hand appeared , the boat dipped slightly , for now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Patience relaxed a little . She knew those hands , knew only one man that large . Will slowly lifted himself waist-high above the gunnel . Then he swung his legs one at a time onto the deck , stood up , and began to walk toward the stern . He was naked . And Patience ,  |p172|per|petually  aroused from the passion of her unendingly erotic dreams , gasped in spite of herself . He froze immediately . Patience was ashamed of having so little selfcontrolthat she would make an involuntary sound ; Will showed no shame about his nakedness . He saw her , shook his head , and then walked toward her a few steps before rounding the cabin wall to where his clothes were waiting . In the moonlight , Patience clearly saw the wide white hairless scar tissue that formed a dimpled and puckered cross from his navel to the root of his groin , and from stem to stem of his hips . From the width of the scars , it was plain he had been branded long ago , as a child . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sect chose to disfigure themselves with the sign of the cross in the hidden places of their bodies . Will was a Vigilant . He did not try to conceal it . He faced her as he pulled on his shirt first , then his trousers . His hair still dripped with water ; he left his stockings and boots aside . In two steps he was before her , as tall as Skyfoot from her perspective . Then in a single swift motion he sat down and looked in her eyes . " A Vigilant was once my master , " he said softly . She did not know why she was afraid of him now . When she had served Oruc , the Vigilants were dangerous because they paid no heed at all to law or government , and when they spoke there was revolution in their words and the courage of madness in their eyes . They were dangerous because the common people believed that they held some special power from God , and came to visit them in their solitary huts , bringing food , clothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was no risk to her now . With what the Vigilants believed about her , she was in less danger from a Vigilant than anyone alive . But she was afraid . " Vigilants do n't brand their slaves , " she said . " Not against their will . " Will nodded . " I was a Vigilant , too . As a child . " " Did you renounce the vows ? " " No . " " Then you 're a Vigilant still ? " " I think of my life  --  as a vigil . But most of the hermits in their little huts would think I am a blasphemer. "  | " And why is that ? " " Because I do n't believe that Kristos will come to unite all humans to rule the world in perfect peace and harmony . " Already this morning he had said more to her than in all the weeks before . Yet his speech was as simple as his silence had been , as if speech or silence made no difference to him . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have answered . " What is your vigil , then ? " " What all vigils are  --  for the coming of Kristos . " " You go in circles . " " In spirals . Closer to the truth on each pass . " She thought again about what he had said , trying to figure out the answer to the problem he had posed . Then she realized that he was testing her , just as Father and Angel had always tested her . She shook her head . " Just tell me . Or do n't tell me . I do n't care . " " I believe that Kristos will come to unite geblings , dwelfs , and gaunts . And humans , too , if they can humble themselves enough . " " Vigilants do n't believe that geblings have souls . " " I told you I was a blasphemer . " " And what of me ? " she asked . Will shook his head and looked down at the deck . She studied his face , the open simplicity of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this visage . Now she saw him as a man at peace with himself , open-faced not because he was naive and trusting , but rather because he was wise and trustworthy . A man without guile . If he did not want to answer , he did not lie ; he simply said nothing . It was the only situation her diplomatic training had never prepared her for : an honest man . Finally he lifted his gaze to her face . His expression changed again . What was it ? Despair and hope , struggling together ? " What do you hope for ? " she whispered . He did not speak . Instead , he reached out his massive hand and brushed the backs of his fingers against her lips . It was the gesture of obeisance to the Heptarch . She went cold inside . Another one who had plans for her . But then he shook his head . " It 's a lie , " he said . " Once that was all I wanted for you . " " And now ? " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part ofp174her hair that had been shaved , gripping her firmly and yet without violence . He leaned his face toward hers , kissed her on the cheek , and pressed his cheek to hers for a long moment . No one had ever embraced her like this . Since her mother died she could not remember anyone really embracing her at all . Her control slipped away , and she trembled . After all the pent-up yearning of the Cranning call , she could not help but know that this was what her body wanted . She turned her face , kissed his cheek . And then cried out in pain . He quickly pulled away from her , studied her face . Could he see the terrible wave of revulsion that swept over her body ? " I 'm sorry , " he murmured . " No , " she whispered , struggling to say words at all . " No , it 's Unwyrm , he forbids it , he forbids  --  " But Patience did not wish to be forbidden . Impulsively she took Will 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his shoulders ; she felt his tentative hands touch her back , her shoulders , and his breath was warm in her hair . But the longer he held her , the more agonizing the punishment from Unwyrm . Even though she was breathing , she felt a terrible , urgent need to breathe , as though someone had pressed a pillow over her face . I am breathing , she told herself , but her body panicked in spite of her will . She pushed Will away and hurled herself down to the deck , gasping . " You are Kristos , " Will said . " Do n't you see ? You 're the hero to face the wyrm in his lair . You 're the one who will save or destroy us all , man and gebling , dwelf and gaunt . " The punishment eased , now that he was n't touching her . She began to breathe more calmly . " He does n't touch your deepest place , " said Will . " He can only force your passion , not your will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaker than their passion . They had spent all their lives increasing their understanding , building their stories of the world . Their memory , their identity , that part of the triune soul was honed to perfection , sharpe than any sword I ever carried into battle . But when Unwyrm came , he came to their passion . It was unfamiliar territory to them , a place they had not conquered in their soul , and so they went to him , thinking they had no choice . " " He made me think I could n't breathe , even though I was breath-ing. "  | " If you had wanted to stay in my arms , " said Will , " you would have stayed . " " I could n't . " " If you had wanted to , completely , without any reservation of your own , you could have stayed . " " How do you know what I can or can not do ? " " Because he has called me , and I know the limits of his power . " She studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As far as she could tell , he spoke the truth . This hulking giant was one of the Wise ? This man who had pulled on his own plow in Reck 's field , who never spoke , who had lived as a slave and believed at least some of the doctrine of the Vigilants  --  was one of the Wise ? " You and I , " said Will , " we have learned the same strength . We both grew up under strong masters , and we both obeyed . But we learned to turn our obedience into freedom . We learned how to choose to obey , even when others thought we had no choice . So that even though we gave the appearance of having no will of our own , all our actions all our lives have been free . " She thought of Father 's and Angel 's tests , the rules of protocol , the rituals of self-denial . Sometimes it was as Will said . Sometimes she chose freely . But other times , no . Other times she was not free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Did he ever take away your breath ? " she asked . " I went into battle one day . My master was the captain general , and his banner drew the enemy to us . I stood between them and him , as I had always done . Only this day , Unwyrm called to me . He put terrible fear in me , but I stood my ground . He made me so thirsty and hungry that my head ached and my mouth went dry , but I stood my ground . He made the need of my bladder and bowel so great that my body released all that it held , but I paid no attention and stood my ground . And then , as the enemy reached me , he made me feel as if I were suffocating . The need to breathe is the one irresistible need , and I knew that I would not find ease from that agony until I left the field of battle and began my trek Cranningward . " " What did you do ? " " What you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing , and then went ahead and did what I wanted , regardless of the pain . I killed forty-nine men that day  --  the flagbearer kept count of it  --  and my master offered me my freedom . "  | " Did you take it ? " " How could he offer me what I already had ? I was free . As you are free . If you had not secretly doubted that you wanted to love me , you would have had me here on this deck . " " And would you have given yourself to me ? " she asked . " Yes . " " Because I am Heptarch ? " " Not because you are Heptarch , but because you are Heptarch . " " I 'm not as strong as you think . " " On the contrary . You 're stronger than you know . " She turned the conversation ; she did not believe him , and wanted to , and feared that if she listened any longer he would lead her to overconfidence . " You 're one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could put in her house ? " " She asked me her question , and I gave her my answer , " said Will . From his tone , she knew not to ask directly what the question or the answer might have been . Instead , she asked her own question . " What did you learn , as a slave ? " " That no one can ever be a slave to another man . " " That is a lie . " " Then I learned a lie . " " But you believe it . " Will nodded . " There are people who do things for fear of the lash . There are people who do things for fear they will lose their families or their lives . There are people bought and sold . Are they not slaves ? " " They are slaves to their passion . Their fear rules them . What power do you have over me if I am not afraid of your lash ? Am I your slave , if I am not afraid to lose my family ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ; am I your slave ? And when you come to hate me for my freedom , which is greater than yours , and you command me to do what I will not do , then I stand before you in disobedience . Punish me , then ; I choose to be punished . And if the punishment is more than I am willing to accept , then I will use such force as is necessary to stop the punishment , and no more . But never , for a moment , have I done anything but what I choose to do . " " Then no one is as strong as you . " " Not so . I 've given my obedience to God , and use my best judgmentp177to carry out his purpose , when I have some understanding of it . But those who have chosen to give their obedience to their passion , or to their memory , they freely choose to obey . The glutton freely overfills his belly , the pederast feeds on innocence , and the fearful man obeys his fear  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our desires were separate from ourselves . " " They are . And if you do n't know that , then you might well become Ij Unwyrm 's slave after all . " " I know something of the doctrine of the Vigilants . " " I am not talking about a school of doctrine . I 'm talking about the answer I gave Heffiji . The reason Unwyrm calls to me . " Now she could ask him outright . " What question did Heffiji ask ? " " She asked me whether dwelfs have a soul . " " Then it is theology . " " What she really was asking  --  and it 's a question you 'd better answer before you face Unwyrm  --  she was asking what part of her was her-self . " Patience studied Will 's placid face . How could he have known the question that so haunted her ? " My father taught me to listen to everything and believe nothing . " " The dead do that much , " said Will . " The dead do n't listen . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as the dead . " " I 'm not dead , " Patience whispered . Will smiled . " I know , " he said . He reached out as if to touch her cheek ; she recoiled from him and shook her head . So he sat back , making no effort to conceal his disappointment , and began to teach . " Each part of the triune soul has its desires . The passion has the desires of pleasure and survival and the avoidance of pain . Those who are slaves to passion are the ones we see as hedonists or cowards or addicts or drunks , the ones we pity or despise . And these slaves think that their passion is themself . I want this drink . I want to breathe . Their identity is in their needs . And to control them is easy . You simply control their pleasure or their pain . " She smiled . " I learned this in the cradle . People who are that easy to control , though , are n't worth controlling . " " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are you one of them ? "  | " When he calls me , I can hardly think of anything else but the need for him . Even when I remember what he looks like , from the gebling memories within me , even when I should loathe him , he makes me want him , want his children . " " You came through Tinker 's Wood when he did n't want you to . " " If he had really wanted to stop me , he could have . " " I say he could n't . Because you long ago separated yourself from your body 's desires . " She remembered the cold breeze from the unglazed window of her room . She nodded . " So . " He did not teach as Father did ; there was no sense of triumph when she bent before his argument . He merely went on . " The second part of the triune soul , the memory  --  it 's more difficult . It has another kind of desire , one that is born in us as surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never satisfied , we do n't know that it exists . For a moment , between breaths , we do n't need to breathe , so we recognize the need to breathe when it returns . " " But this one is never gone , so we never notice it . " " Yes . Yes , you see  --  our memory ca n't hold everything . Ca n't hold every vision we see , every sequence of events that happened to us , everything we read , everything we hear about . It 's too much . If we actually had to do that , we 'd be insane before we left our infancy . So we choose . The things that are important . We remember only what matters . And we remember it in certain orders , in patterns that mean things together . In daytime , the sun is up ; and all daytime becomes one day , and all nighttime becomes one night  --  we do n't have to rememberevery day to remember the idea of day . But we do n't just remember this  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun is up . Or the sun is up because it is daytime . You see ? We do n't remember randomly . Everything is connected by threads of cause . " " I 'm not one of the Wise , " said Patience . " Maybe the Wise understandthe cause of everything , but I do n't . " " But that 's just it , that 's just where the hunger comes . Every shred of experience that we remember comes as a story  --  a series of events that are connected by the pushes and pulls of cause . And we believe this story , of how everything is causally connected , without questioning it . I did this because . I did this in order to . And this is the world we live in , this pattern of events that cause each other . It becomes the frame/work by which we remember everything . But some things come along that do n't fit . " " Not just some things . " " The weak-minded never notice it , Lady Patience . Everything fits for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't belong . They never happened , the memory is gone . But for those who live in the mind , the places that do n't fit , they do n't disappear . They become a terrible hunger in the mind . Why , they shout . Why , why , why . And you ca n't be content until you know the connection . Even if it means breaking apart all the network that existed before . Once there was a time when mankind was locked on a single planet , and they thought their star circled that planet , because that was all they saw . That was the evidence of their eyes . But there were some who looked closely , and saw that it did n't fit , and the why pressed upon them until they had an answer . And when it all fit , they were able to send starshipsto worlds like this . " " Every child asks why , " said Patience . " But most children stop asking , " said Will . " They finally get a systemthat works well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they care about , and anything their stories ca n't handle , they ignore . " " The priests say that the self is in the memory  --  that we are what we remember doing . " " That 's what they say . " " But I remember doing the acts of hundreds of Hcptarchs , and a few geblings , too . Are they part of myself ? " " You see the problem as few people see it , " said Will . " The self is n't in the memory , only the story we believe about ourselves . It can also be revised . It 's constantly being revised . We see what it was we did , and we make up a story to account for it , and believe the story , and think that we understand ourself . " " Except the dwelfs , who ca n't hold long memories in their consciousminds . " " Yes . " " So what did you tell Heffiji  --  that she had no soul ? " " Only that her soul had no story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would say ; it was clear to her now . " The will , of course . It 's strange , Will , that you 're named for the thing that youp180think is most important . Or did you decide it was important because it was your name ? " " Will was n't the name I was born with . I took that name the day Reck looked at me and said , Who are you ? ' " " What 's the desire of the will , then ? You said all three parts of the soul had their desire . " " The will makes only a simple choice , and it 's already made . Your whole life is nothing but acting out the choice that defines who you really are . " " What 's that ? " " The choice between good and evil . " She let him see her disappointment . " All this talk , and we come to that ? " " I 'm not talking about the choice between killing people and not killing people , or between stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes killing a person is good . You know that . " " Which is why I decided not to care about good and evil a long time ago . " " No . You decided not to care about legal and illegal . " " I decided there was n't any absolute good and there was n't any absoluteevil . You just said the same thing . " " No I did n't , " said Will . " You said sometimes killing is good and sometimes it 's evil . " " So . Killing is n't absolute . But now , when you go to Unwyrm , what 's wrong with doing what he wants ? What 's wrong with you having his children ? " " Because I do n't want to . " " Why ? You know he 'll give you pleasure . And your children  --  they 'll be human , perfectly human , only stronger and smarter , wiser and quicker , and they 'll no doubt have a perfect connection between their minds , all of them like Unwyrm combined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the master race . The most magnificent intelligent beings ever created . The next step in human evolution . Why do n't you desire it ? " " I do n't know , " she said . " If you do n't know , then at the crucial moment , when you are with him , and all your desire is for him , you still wo n't know . You 'll still refuse , but perhaps not with all your strength . And it 'll take all your strength to resist him , I promise you . "  | " Come with me , " she said . " Kill him for me . " " I 'll come with you , if I can . And I 'll kill him , if I can . But I think I wo n't be able to . I think there 's only one person who 'll ever come close enough to hurt him , to stop him . " " Then tell me . What is it I need to know ? " " It 's simple . Nothing exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an atom . It does n't exist , except in relation to other atoms . If it never responded to anything else , it would not exist . All existence is like that  --  utterly isolated pieces that only come into existence in their interaction with other pieces . Human beings too . We do n't exist except in relation to the other events of the world . Everything we do , everything we are depends on our responses to other events , and other events ' responses to us . " " I knew that . " " You did n't know that . It 's so obvious that no one knows it . If nothingyou did caused any change in the world outside , and nothing in the world outside caused any change in you , then you would n't know there was a world outside , and it would n't know you existed , and so it would be meaningless to speak of your existence at all . So your existence , all our existence , depends on every piece , every person in the universe behaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order in which everything exists . The laws that bind atoms and moleculesare very firm . They have no freedom to vary , because as soon as they vary , they cease to be . But life  --  ah , there the freedom begins . And we who think we are intelligent , we are the freest of all . We make our own patterns and change them as we like . We build systems and orders and tear them down . But you 'll notice that none of our choices have any effect whatever on the way that atoms and molecules behave . Just as we have no idea what any particular molecule is doing , they have no notion of what we 're doing . We ca n't change their order at all . We can use it , but we ca n't break down their system and cause them to wink out of existence . " " I suppose that 's true . We can burn wood , but the atoms that are torn from certain molecules combine again with others , and the systemhangs together . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil to most of the universe . Only to other living things . Mostly to each other . Because the systems of human beings are ours to control . They 're every bit as real as the universe itself , and they are what gives us our existence  --  but we canp182manipulate them . We can change the systems that create the terms of our life . And we do change those systems , according to the single simple choice of our will . " " What 's the choice ? " " It arises from the desire of the will . And the desire of the will is simple . To grow . " " I do n't want to grow . " " Every living thing has this same desire , Patience . Angel touched on it , in his childish way , when he spoke of people who own things . That 's the most pathetic way people have of growing . The way Sken makes this boat part of herself  --  it makes her larger . Eating also makes her larger . " Patience smiled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Kings also make themselves larger , because their kingdom is part of themself . Parents make themselves larger through their children . Some few people , though , have such a powerful hunger that they ca n't be satisfied until their self includes everything alive . " " The King 's House is all the world , " murmured Patience . " What did you say ? " " Something my father taught me . " " Oh . " " So , is it good or evil to desire to be larger ? " " Neither . It 's how you choose to grow larger . The system lives on sacrifice . No order could exist in which every person in it received everything he desired all the time . The system that gives us our existencedepends on people making sacrifices . I give up something I desire , so that others can receive some of what they desire . In turn , they give up something they want , so I can have some of what I want . Every human society depends on that simple principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to solve the problem before it had to be explained to her . " So you 're saying that good people sacrificeeverything , and evil people sacrifice nothing . " " Not at all . I 'm saying that good people sacrifice anything that is necessary in order to maintain the order that allows all others to exist , even if they have to sacrifice their own life . While evil people manipulateand force the sacrifice of any and every other person in order to wholly gratify their own hunger . Do you see the difference ? " " This is theology . Kristos was good , because he sacrificed his life . " " Do n't speak foolishly , Patience , not to me . Everybody dies , andp183some have been martyrs in stupid causes . Kristos is Kristos because we believe he sacrificed himself for the whole world . For the largest order of all . He would not have died for anything less . Because his self had grown to include all the systems of mankind , and he acted to protect them all . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course you do . These fools who think their Kristos will come to unite humans in perfect peace , without including the millions of geblings , gaunts , and dwelfs  --  it would not be good , because such a Kristos would be forcing the sacrifice of half the people of the world , to serve herself . So if Kristos is to be Kristos , she is willing to sacrifice anything to maintain the order that gives life to all . " " I 'm no Kristos . I do n't believe any of this . " Will looked sad . " Oh , you believe my story , " he said . " But you wo n't know that you believe it until after , looking back . If either of us is alive then . " " It 's a pretty philosophy , " said Patience . " It makes sense within itself . You 'd have a sure career in the School . " He let the insult roll off him . " When you face him , Patience , you 'll remember . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , and you 'll remember who you are , and who he is , and you 'll doubt your own desires and believe my story . You 'll destroy him , even though at that moment you 'll love him more than all the world . You 'll destroy him , because you know he 's evil . " " If I can destroy him , it will be to save myself . " " Yourself is the world , and all the worlds . How long before his children , after they 've replaced all other intelligent life on this world , build starships and go out to conquer every other world that humanity has visited ? There was once a philosopher who said that there could never be war between the worlds of different stars , because there 'd be nothing to gain . But he was a fool . There is greatness to be gained , largeness of self , to have every world filled with your children . It 's the most powerfulurge of all life . Questions of profit or politics are trivial beside it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patience , " it wo n't be a grand question of good and evil . It 'll be me , my body , my wit , such as it is , against his . Nothing more . " " His house against the King 's House . The prize is the world . " " I do n't want the world . " " That 's why you 'll have it . " **25;15222;TOOLONG did n't expect to encounter a man and a woman with three horses cutting across open ground around Batten . In a fireless camp that night in a small gully , she remarked , " I ca n't live this way . " " What , sneaking around like this ? Surrounded by people who would gut us unless they had the good sense to take us prisoner if they only knew we were here ? You are n't having fun ? " Geraden snorted softly . " Terisa , I 'm surprised at you . " Actually , she was surprised at herself . Without warning , she was filled with a sense of how strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passive girl who had typed sad letters for Reverend Thatcher until she had lost faith in him and his mission ? Was n't she the lonely woman who had decorated her apartment in mirrors because she did n't know any other way to prove she existed ? So what was she doing here ?  --  surrounded , as Geraden observed , by enemies ; struggling across country on horseback in a nearly crazy effort to warn King Joyse that his wife had been abducted ; so angry at Master Eremis that she could n't think about it without trembling . What was she doing ? " So am I , " she murmured ; but Geraden had been teasing her , and she was serious . The night on all sides felt at once vast and subtle , too big to be faced , too cunning to be escaped . And the stars  --  She knew in her bones that the city where her apartment was had nowherenear this many stars watching it . " Right now , it seems like there is n't another place in the universe farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Are you afraid ? " he asked gently . " We still have a long way to go . He was n't talking about the distance to Orison . " That 's the funny part , " she mused . " When I stop and take my pulse , I get the impression I 've never been so scared in all my life . But when I think about where I came from "  --  my apartment , my job , my parents  --  " I think I 've never been so brave . " After a while , he said , " It makes an amazing difference when you have good , clear reasons for what you 're doing . I think I used to have so many accidents because I was confused . In conflict with myself . " She agreed , but she did n't say so . Instead , she said , " Do n't get ccu ky . I saw you almost fall out of that tree . "  |p301That  made him laugh . And his laughter always made her feel better . Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing was unprecedented . Despite the darkness  --  despite the fact that his men could n't see Orison 's counterattacks in time to defend themselves very well  --  he was belaboring the gates with the heaviest battering ram he had . He had two reasons for risking the blood of his army so lavishly , one immediate , the other alarming . His immediate reason was that just before sunset the defenders had stopped pouring oil on the shells of his rams . The particular ram spared by this forbearance was n't especially impressive : its shell protectedonly enough men to move it , not enough to seriously threaten the gates . Nevertheless the forbearance itself was significant . Withouthesitation , the Prince called back that ram and sent out a bigger one , fully manned . This one , also , was allowed to do its work without being set afire . Two interpretations immediately suggested themselves . Orison was out of oil . Or Orison was trying to conserve oil  --  was trusting the dark for protection . Under other circumstances , this chance to hit the gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , protected by darkness from archers , the castle 's defenders would be able to swing down from the walls on ropes and strike at the ram in a matter of minutes . But the Prince was too worried to miss any opportunity , however costly it might prove . He was alarmed because during the afternoon his scouts had intercepted two hacked and dying men who were apparently the last survivors the Perdon would ever send to Orison . They were n't actually sure of their lord 's fate . When he sent them away , he still had several hundred men around him , was still fighting . But he knew he was finished . He sent these two soldiers to warn King Joyse . They were too badly hurt to last the night ; but Prince Kragen pieced their story together from their confused and feverish babblings . What had apparently happened was that High King Festten had suddenly changed his tactics . He had halted his unexplained march into the Care of Tor : for a while , he had even stopped strikingp302at the Perdon . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gained his goal , as if his only real purpose had been to capture the ground where he now stood  --  a relatively uninhabited region of complexhills and thin rivers no closer to Marshalt than to Orison . And then , while the Perdon was still trying to figure out what Festten was doing , the High King had sent out nearly five thousand soldiers to encircle and trap the lord . In the end , only the terrain had enabled these two wounded men to escape . They had hidden in a tree-clogged ravine until darkness allowed them to creep away northward . How many days ago ? Prince Kragen wanted to know . How far exactly ? In fact , he wanted to know so badly that out of raw frustrationhe was tempted to resort to some of the harsher forms of questioning . But it was obvious that the Perdon 's men , in effect , had already been tortured past the point where they were able to think or speak coherently . Prince Kragen was left with very little idea when they had left their lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gates at night , despite the losses he knew he was going to incur . He was afraid : he could feel a kind of doom stalking him through the dark . An enemy who would march at least twenty thousand men that fair into the middle of nowhere  --  in this case , the middle of the Care of Tor  --  for no discernible purposeexcept to make camp was capable of anything . Through the hours of darkness , Kragen listened to the flat , dull booming of the ram against the gates , to the shouts of the defenders and the cries of his own forces  --  listened , and ground his teeth to restrain his rage at a war he could n't either avoid or understand . Castellan Lebbick appeared to be in a completely different mood . If he felt any desire to rage , he did n't show it . From the battlements above the gate , he watched the massive Alend ram at work with a twisted expression on his face , as if something inside him were being torn ; yet he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't even grin . For no very clear reason , he muttered in disgust words that sounded to the guards around him like , " fool woman . " Then he called for ropes and began mustering men to fight for the gates . Ile did n't stay to watch the struggle , however . A number of his captains knew what to do in a situation like this . Wandering away like a shadow of the man he used to be , he went to spend as much of the night as possible drinking with Artagel.  |p303Unfortunately  , ale  --  even in that quantity  --  did nothing to quench the hot , dry sensation in his mind . He was full of foreboding ; his brain chewed anticipations of disaster . So he was grimly amazed when he woke up the next morning and learned that something good was happening . It was raining . A hard rain , so thick that it blinded the castle and turned the dirt of the courtyard into immediate soup ; what the people where Lebbick had grown up called a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in the spring . Of course , it made Orison impossible to defend . The guards above the gates would n't have known if the entire Alend army had come within a stone 's throw of their noses . On the other hand , the rain also made attack impossible . The Alends had no footing . They could bring up battering rams until they broke their hearts ; but they could n't swing them effectively . The gates would stand forever against any pounding they might receive in this rain . And other siege engines were equally useless . The rain did n't cheer Castellan Lebbick up . He was past the point where anything could have cheered him . But it did give him a breathing space , a bit of time in which to get a better grip on himself . It also helped Terisa and Geraden . That surprised her . She got so wet and so cold so quickly that she felt defeated before the day had well begun . She soon realized , however , that she and Geraden were in next to no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If she had let him get more than ten feet away , she would n't have been able to spot him herself . Now the trick had nothing to do with being stopped . The trick was to know where they were going . " How do you know we 're not lost ? " she shouted into the deluge . " The rain ! " Despite the water streaming down his face , he grinned . " At this time of year , it always comes from the west ! We 're going south , so all we have to do is cut across the wind ! " She would have been impressed if her whole body had n't felt so miserable . Nevertheless she kept going ; she and Geraden kept each otherp304going . While their enemies were blinded was the best time for them to go forward . The rain might make it impossible for Torrent to follow her mother ; but Terisa was too cold and soaked to worry about something that far out of her control . She concentrated solely on Geraden and motion until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he had an opportunity to find his bearings . " Tomorrow . " There was relief in his voice ; yet she had never heard him sound so tired . " We 'll be in the Demesne tomorrow morning . Tomorrow afternoon or evening we 'll reach Orison . " Just for something to say , she muttered , " If Prince Kragen does n't give me some dry clothes , I 'm going to spit right in his face . " Geraden nodded his approval . " Just do n't kick him . I 've heard princes tend to get cranky when they 're kicked . " " I do n't care , " she retorted . " I 've been on a horse for as long as I can remember , and my whole body hurts . I 'm going to kick anybody I want . " Again , he nodded . " You may have to . " It was obvious that his thoughts were elsewhere . " We 've been carrying a lot of questions around for a long time . Tomorrow we 'll start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet . " Terisa refused to worry about that . All she wanted at the moment was to be warm and dry . The inhabitants of Orison had the opposite reaction : they prayed for more rain . Unluckily , they did n't get it . By the next morning , the ground was dry enough for Prince Kragen to resume his attack . The mud was still thick : a sea of it surrounded Orison . But decades or centuries of use had packed the roadbed hard ; it gave the Alends enough footing to put some heft into the swing of their ram . Protected by shields and shells , nearly a thousand men edged close to the walls to ward the ram as it hammered the gates . Every blow seemed to carry through the stone to the tops of the towers , the bottoms of the dungeons . In response , Castellan Lebbick 's guards cranked up mangonels powerful enough to dent iron and splinter wood . The mangonels shattered Alend shields almost effortlessly , reduced the flesh under the shields to pulp and crushed bone . Lebbick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And his men had to fire scores of lead bolts in order to damage the shell protecting the ram.  |p305Slowly  , inevitably , one blow at a time , the gates began to fail . The wood started to compress and crack ; stress showed along the iron strutwork ; mortar sifted from between the stones which held the gates in the wall ; bolts began to work loose . At the moment , Prince Kragen was paying for this success with dozens and then hundreds of his men . Inside the castle , Orison 's defenders suffered no losses . But that imbalance would shift as soon as the gates broke . " Tomorrow , " Lebbick muttered , inspecting their timbers with an expert eye . " Those shitlickers 'll be in here tomorrow . We 've got that long to live . " He did n't sound upset . He did n't even sound angry . He sounded satisfied . Dutifully , he sent a report to King Joyse . Then he reduced Orison 's defenders to a minimum . Every guard who could be spared he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever friends or family the man had left . His wife would have approved of that . Amiably , Artagel asked him , " What do you suppose King Joyse will do to save us ? " Entirely without warning , Castellan Lebbick recovered his rage . " The way our luck 's going "  --  he was clenching his teeth so hard his forehead felt like it might crack  --  " he 'll challenge Prince fornicating Kragen to a duel . " With fury crackling in every muscle , he left the gates and the courtyard . While he was angry , at least , he could n't bear to watch what was happening . Like the Prince , he had no way of knowing that Terisa and Geraden were already in the Demesne . Late that afternoon , they rode as if they were fearless straight up to the first Alend patrol they met and demanded to be taken to the lady Elega . Swords and distrust surrounded them promptly . Terisa 's mount showed a distressing inclination to shy in all directions ; she had to tight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather had turned chilly since the previous day 's rain . Alends ? she wondered . Not Cadwals ? Does that mean Orison is still standing ? But she had no intention of asking those questions aloud . After all ,  |p306these  soldiers were dressed and armored just like the men who had taken Queen Madin . The leader of the patrol snapped , " What makes pigslop like you two think you 've got a reason to see the Prince 's lady ? " Geraden 's mouth smiled , but his eyes were hard . " We 're servants , " he answered with a hint of danger in his voice . " Our parents have served her family since before we were born . We grew up with her . " We 've come from Romish . The Queen sent us to see her . " The Alend leader snarled a curse . " The Queen ? Madin , that shithole Joyse 's wife ? " The effort of controlling her horse disguised Terisa 's face as effectively as a mask . Geraden 's expression was positively serene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you 've heard of her , " he said blandly . " Good . Then you 'll understand that the lady Elega wo n't take it kindly if you prevent us from delivering our messages . " " Queen Madin ? " the Alend repeated in a voice congested with hostility . " You 've got messages from Queen Madin ? " Geraden 's mouth smiled again . " My , you are quick . " Then , softly , he said , " Take us to see the lady Elega . " A little thrill touched Terisa 's heart as she heard the authority in his tone . The leader of the patrol hesitated ; he was taken aback  --  a fact which seemed to surprise him . To compensate , he growled an obscenity . Then he said , " I think the Prince is going to want to hear your messages . " As long as we get to talk to her , " replied Geraden , " I do n't care who else hears us . Take us to see them both . " Just do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alend leader turned and organized his men to escort Geraden and Terisa toward the encampment . A pair of the Alends galloped ahead ; the rest formed a knot around the travelers . Suddenly giddy with relief  --  perhaps because her horse had stopped shying  --  she took the risk of giving Geraden a wink . He pretended not to notice it . They were closer to the siege than she had realized . In only a short time , they came in sight of the Alend army and Orison . She was surprised by how small the castle looked under these in umstances , invested by ten thousand soldiers , half a hundredp307siege engines , and an uncounted number of servants and camp followers . Orison 's bluff gray stone , which should have appeared impregnable , bore an unexpected resemblance to cardboard ; tiny flags fluttering from the towers gave the place the air of a child 's plaything . At the same time , the breach partially covered by the curtainwallseemed to gape unnaturally wide , as if it were bigger than it used to be , darker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead had already caused a commotion : Terisa could see the army and its adherents shifting to receiveher and Geraden . People ran forward to stare ; questions were called which the Alend leader either ignored or shouted down . The attack on the gates used only a fraction of Prince Kragen 's forces ; the rest had nothing to do at the moment except wait and worry . Some of the soldiers only wanted news . But others offered jokes and insults that turned Geraden 's eyes as sharp as bits of glass . He preserved his expression of serenity , however , and followed the patrolin through the camp . They passed an area of tattered and scruffy tents where the poorest of the camp followers lived , ankle-deep in the overflow of their own squalor . Then the order and cleanliness of the encampment began to improve , according to the increasing status of its occupants . In minutes , the patrol brought Terisa and Geraden to an open area like an imitation of a courtyard , around which were pitched several tents so large and luxurious that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their immediate goal , at any rate . In order to enter Orison , they first had to get past Prince Kragen . He came out of one of the tents into the evening shadows before anyone had a chance to dismount . He moved as if he intended to approach the riders directly ; but as soon as he saw them he stopped . I le planted his fists on his hips when Terisa met his gaze ; his black eyes flashed as if she had given him a slap . For a moment , forcing himself to be thorough , he turned his head and considered Geraden ; then he faced Terisa again . " ' Servants of the Queen ' ? " he demanded of his men in a tone that might have been jesting or bitter . " They said that , and you believedthem ? Did not one of you louts think to ask them their names ? " I lc did n't give the leader of the patrol a chance to respond , however . " Oh , let it pass . They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would have been worse fooled than before.  | " At least have the common sense to disarm them . Then go . " Stung , the leader of the patrol snatched away Terisa 's and Geraden'sweapons , the swords the Termigan had given them . Then the men withdrew . Prince Kragen gave the impression that the patrol had already ceased to exist as far as he was concerned . He was concentrating exclusively on Terisa . " My lady Terisa of Morgan . " He spoke slowly , drawling in a way which suggested humor or scorn . " You astonish me entirely . And your companion must be the infamous Apt Geraden , the butt alike of mirth and augury . I can think of no other possibility . " However , you may amaze me there as well . Since you are out here "  --  he released one fist from his hip to gesture at the ground between the tents  --  " when it is obvious that you ought to be in there "  --  he indicated Orison  --  " I conclude that you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  gradually , his tone convinced Terisa that he was n't in a happy mood  --  " now . " " My lord Prince , " Geraden put in steadily , as if he were n't interruptingthe Alend Contender , " where is the lady Elega ? " " I am here , Geraden . " Terisa turned in her saddle and saw the King 's daughter . Elega stood between the flaps of one of the tents . A streak of sunset caught her face , so that her usual paleness was covered with an orange-gold blush , and light muffled the vividness of her eyes . In that way , she looked like she had become an entirely different woman since Terisa had last seen her . " So it is true , my lady Terisa , " she said clearly , lifting up her voice as though this were a formal occasion . " It was always true . You are an Imager . " Prince Kragen 's mouth moved under his moustache , swearing . When he spoke , however , he kept his tone neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady Elega ? " Elega 's gaze did n't shift from Terisa ; she studied Terisa through the failing beams of the sun . " As you said , my lord Prince , they are not in Orison . It is doubtful that they were able to creep out through your siege . Therefore they must have removed themselves by Imagery . " Or someone else removed us , " Geraden put in acerbically.  | " Do n't forget that possibility . You do n't think Gart does his own translations , do you ? " An unexpected silence fell over the tents . Elega half raised a hand to her mouth , then dropped it . A glint of white teeth showed between Prince Kragen 's lips . From somewhere in the distance , Terisaheard a methodical booming , a deep thud at once so hard and so far away that it seemed to come through the ground rather than the air . Men shouted faintly . Her presence there , and Geraden 's , must have come as a complete surprise to Elega and the Prince . Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it made the whole situation incomprehensible . Well , Terisa thought , this was better than being tied up  --  or cut down . She felt an off-center , almost loony desire to give Geraden a round of applause . The men who had taken Queen Madin were Alends . And Terisa and Geraden had so many questions  --  And they wanted to get into Orison . If Kragen really had ordered the Queen 's abduction , their only hope was to keep him off balance and pray for something unexpected to happen . Trying to make a contribution , she asked , " My lord Prince , may we get down ? I 've been on this horse ever since I can remember . " A small shudder seemed to pass through Prince Kragen , a brief convulsion of will . At once , he became calmer , as if his self-possessionhad been tightened a notch . " Of course , my lady Terisa . " He moved toward her . " Where other matters are concerned , I have said that the debts between us are settled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so you are welcome among us . Permit me to offer you the Alend Monarch 's hospitality . " He reached up his hands to help her dismount . That was a courtesy to which she was n't accustomed , but she did her best to let him assist her . Geraden swung down and came to her side ; at once , he bowed formally to Prince Kragen . " My lord Prince , I have n't been properly presented , but you 've named me . I 'm Geraden , the seventh son of the Domne , an Apt of the Congery of Imagers . " As you say , we have a remarkable story to tell . " Somehow , he ontrived to sound like he could n't think of a single reason to distrust the Prince . " And there must be a lot you could tell us , if we can ( persuade you to do it . " " Geraden . " Elega had come forward while Terisa was focusedp310on Prince Kragen . Her face and form were in shadow now , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more capable . " What does this mean ? " she demanded . " Why are you here ? And how ? Surely you will not ask us to believe that this is nothing more than another of your colossal mishaps ? " " No , " Geraden replied . " On the other hand , I do expect you to believe that it 's hard for me to trust you enough to tell you anything . " There : he had given the first hint of his loyalties ; therefore of his intentions . Terisa held her breath , afraid that he might be risking too much too soon . Fortunately , Kragen was n't surprised enough to react badly . He knew what had happened to Nyle 's attempt to reach the Perdon : he was probably able to take Geraden 's loyalties for granted . Before Elega could respond to Geraden 's gibe , Prince Kragen stepped between them and took Terisa 's arm . " We will discuss such things thoroughly , I assure you , " he remarked , " but I can see no reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private . " With his hand on her arm , he urged Terisa into motion , steering her toward the largest of the surrounding tents . " In addition , I have offered you the Alend Monarch 's hospitality , and he does not like to be refused . " As if she were n't already moving  --  as if she had a choice  --  he asked , " Will you come with me ? " Terisa nodded . But she did n't let out her breath until she saw that both Geraden and Elega were following . The Prince took her into what she realized after a moment was a fore-tent . It was lit only by the braziers which warmed it , with the result that its furnishings were obscure , vaguely ominous ; the chairs seemed to crouch in the dimness , as unpredictable as beasts . Prince Kragen clapped his hands , however , and called for lamps as well as wine . The servants responded almost instantly ; soon warm yellow light filled the fore-tent , and the danger crept away , hiding in the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows behind the chairs . " The Alend Monarch has gone to his bed , " Prince Kragen said casually . " Otherwise he would welcome you himself . This tent serves as his council chamber , and I doubt "  --  he smiled  --  " that there is a man in all the camp who would dare eavesdrop on what is said here . We will speak freely . " Briskly , he got Terisa , Geraden , and Elega seated . When thep311wine had been served , he took a chair himself . Terisa drank a gulp of the fine vintage , trying to control her nervousness ; but Elega watched her and Geraden , while Geraden faced the Prince . Prince Kragen toyed with his goblet . " My lady Terisa , Geraden , these are complex times . I suspect that all stories are remarkable . Nevertheless your arrival here suggests questions to which I must have answers . " " Forgive me , my lord Prince , " Geraden put it as if he had n't heard Kragen . " So much has happened  --  The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army . Where is it ? What 's happened to the Perdon ? How has Orison been able to hold you back so long ? " " Geraden , I am in command of this siege . " The Prince 's voice became a soft purr , a threat . " This army is mine . I wish to understand how you come to be here . " " Of course "  --  Geraden allowed himself a slight , suggestive pause  --  " my lord Prince . On the other hand , I wish to be able to measure the consequences of what I tell you . I 'm talking to an honorableenemy and a dishonorable friend . " He ignored the way Elega stiffened , the violet flare of her gaze . " Knowledge is power . I do n't want to place a weapon in the wrong hands . " " You will not . " Prince Kragen might have been a cat pretending that he was n't about to spring . " You will place it in my hands . " Geraden did n't blink . " Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no or else . ' I simply state a fact . You will tell me your remarkable story . " His tone left Terisa 's stomach in knots . When she looked in her goblet , she found that it was already empty . " Geraden , " Elega put in , " why did you came here ? You have never been stupid . You knew that this situation would arise . You knew that both the Prince and I desire the defeat of Orison . And you knew "  --  she seemed to falter , but only for an instant  --  " that we can not afford to let you keep your knowledge secret . We are too much at risk . My life is perhaps a little thing , but the Prince is responsiblefor the whole Alend army . In the end , he is responsible for the survival of all his father 's realm . " And for that , " Elega added firmly , " I have my own responsibility . Like the King , I have brought us to this place . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , if you do not intend to tell us what you know ? "  | " Because we are unable to reenter Orison without your consent . " Geraden did n't elaborate . " That is what you want ? " demanded Prince Kragen softly . " You wish to be allowed to enter Orison , so that you can tell King Joyse the story you mean to withhold from me ? " Geraden contemplated this view of the situation . " That 's essentiallytrue , my lord Prince . " " I suspected as much . " The Prince held his hands together on his thighs , the tips of his fingers touching each other lightly as if his self-command had become perfect . " My mind is not like my lady Elega 's . When you entered my camp , I did not say , Here are Imagers . I said , Here are scouts who wish to report to their lord . " If you believe that I will let you pass my siege in order to take assistance or information of any kind to KingJoyse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the blandness of his expression , he had no idea how seriously he was being threatened . Terisa was too full of anxiety to sit still . Without asking permission , she stood up and went to the wine decanter . " Why do n't we trade ? " she said impulsively . Fatigue and the first effects of the wine might have been speaking for her . She had played the game of trading information with King Joyse : she knew it was dangerous . But it was the best she had to offer . Her goblet full , she returned to her seat . " You tell us something . We 'll tell you something . Fair exchange . That way we do n't have to trust each other . " " Who will speak first ? " asked Elega in a carefully neutral tone . " You will . " Terisa did n't hesitate . " We 're in your power . You can do anything you want to us anytime you want . What have you got to lose ? " She sat down . Geraden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince Kragen . The Prince thought for a while ; he did n't appear to be aware that he was chewing his moustache . Two of his fingertips tapped soundlessly against each other , measuring the menace in the foretent . Then he said with steady nonchalance , " I think not . " My lady Elega , " he continued before Terisa was sure that she had heard him right , " you have not heard the details of our guests ' arrival . You will be interested , I am sure . " Geraden and the lady Terisa made no attempt at stealth . Theyp313confronted one of my patrols "  --  he paused ominously  --  " but they did not request an audience with me . They did not request permission to approach Orison . No , my lady , they demanded the right to speak with you . " Involuntarily , Elega caught her breath . While she stared at Geraden and Terisa , Prince Kragen added , " It is clear that whatever device or policy they have prepared to get them into Orison is directed at you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Again , he paused ; then he remarked cryptically , " It is even conceivable that they are aware of the existence of a precedent . " In response , Elega 's eyes widened with pain and anger . " That is unfair , my lord . " Almost instantly , however , she seemed to catch the implications of what he said . In a rush , she asked , " Geraden , have you seen  --  ? " So suddenly , so loudly that the sound made Terisa 's heart lurch , Prince Kragen slapped his hands together , interrupting Elega ; stoppingher . " My lady , " he articulated , " I have said that I do not wish to trade stories with them . When they have told us what they know , I will decide what they may hear . " Elega held her tongue ; yet her face showed the difficulty of restraint . Abruptly , Terisa became aware that she wanted to hear Elega 's story : the Elega she remembered would n't have suffered a command to shut up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to make her acquiescent ? What kind of contest was going on between her and the Prince ? Was it just a question of blame because her attack on the reservoir had misfired ? Or had she done something else to earn Kragen 's distrust ? Because her heart was still racing and she wanted to be calm , Terisa went to get some more wine . As if they were being polite , the other people in the fore-tent waited until she had seated herself again . She had the impression that they were all watching her . " You serve a heady wine , my lord Prince , " Geraden murmured softly . " I have n't tasted anything like it for a long time . " In Terisa 's opinion , that was an odd thing to say at a time like this . Apparently , Prince Kragen agreed with her . He ignored Geraden'scomment . Still speaking to Elega as if she were the true subjectp314of his scrutiny , he said , " In any case , my lady , I have not yet told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terisa demanded to speak to you , they gave a most interesting explanation . They said that they had messages for you from Queen Madin , your mother . " At once , Elega was on her feet . " The Queen ? " She did n't appear to realize that she was standing . " You have spoken with the Queen ? She sent messages for me ? " Her eyes shone with excitement and anguish ; her voice held a visceral tremor . " Doubtless you told her of my part in the siege . What does my mother wish to say to me now ? " Terisa was bemused to find that she had slipped down in her chair . The wine seemed to have made her top-heavy . Pushing herself upright , she said , " We can tell you who the traitors are inside Orison . Who the renegade Imagers are . We can tell you how they planned all this with Cadwal . Together , we might be able to guess what kind of trap they plan to spring . " Prince Kragen 's gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she added , " If you want to trade , we can even tell you what Domne and Termigan and Fayle are going to do about it . " As far as she could tell , Geraden and Elega and Kragen were all speaking at once . Geraden asked , " Do you know what you 're doing ? You look like you 've had too much wine . " He sounded like a man who had lost his sense of humor . At the same time , Elega protested , " No ! I will hear my mother 's messages ! " Prince Kragen was saying , " Continue , my lady Terisa . " Despite his self-control , he looked eager . " I am sure that we will be able to achieve an equitable exchange when you are done . " Grinning , Terisa wagged her finger at him . " Oh , no , my lord Prince . " She actually wagged her finger at him . " Be fair . That is n't the way the game is played . " Geraden stood facing Elega ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone did n't hold any authority , however . It did n't even convey confidence . Instead , it hinted at hysteria . " The fact is , " he said , " we do n't have any messages from the Queen . She did n't have time to give us any . She was planning to come here herself . She wanted to stand beside the King . But she did n't get the chance . "  |p315In  spite of the pressure to speak , he faltered . Elega 's gaze was fastened to his face ; her whole body concentrated toward him . " Go on , " she said with her throat clenched . " Continue , my lady ! " Prince Kragen snapped , apparently trying to startle words out of Terisa . Just in time , Terisa put her finger to her lips and made a shushingnoise . " Elega , I 'm sorry , " Geraden said miserably . " While we were there , the Queen was taken . Ambushed . Imagery and soldiers . She was abducted . " Slowly , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her mouth . " We know who the Imager was . " Her breath came hard , straining between her teeth . " The soldiers were Alends . " Prince Kragen was so startled that he sprang to his feet and barked , " You lie ! " before he could stop himself . Terisa studied the three of them . " No . " It was wonderful how clearly she could speak , despite the weight in her head . " He 's not lying . We were there . That 's why we want to go into Orison . That 's what we want to tell King Joyse . Your men kidnapped Queen Madin . " From Terisa 's perspective , the lady Elega went up like a candleflame . Without moving , she seemed to burst into passion ; it swept through her toward the ceiling , hot enough to scorch . Confronting the Prince as if Terisa and Geraden were forgotten , she whispered like a cry , " What have you done ? " Kragen 's face twisted ; his teeth showed under his moustache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a lie . " She did n't flicker . " Geraden has never told a lie in his life  --  never one of such hurt . What have you done ? " " Nothing ! " he shouted at her , trying to drive back her fury . " Geraden does not lie ? Perhaps not . I do not lift my hand against lonely and harmless women ! Never in my life . " Perhaps she did n't hear him : perhaps she could n't . Her hands clenched into fists against her cheeks ; blazing , she lifted her voice into a wail . " Where is my mother ? What have you done to my mother ? " In that outcry , she burned up too brightly to sustain herself.  |p316She  was too vulnerable : her strength failed , and she fainted . Delicately , like heated wax , she slumped toward the floor . Geraden caught her . Holding her in his arms , he faced the Prince . Now he was the one breathing hard , panting for air as if he had caught fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prince Kragen came to him in dismay , tried to take her from him . He wrenched her away as if he did n't care that the Prince could have him killed . " There are only two possibilities . My lord Prince . Is n't that right ? Either you did it . So you 're going to tie me and Terisa up and start torturing us . Or it was done to you . So you 're going to let us go see the King . " Which is it ? " But Prince Kragen was n't listening . " Release her , Geraden , " he murmured , almost pleading . " She is only your friend . I love her . If all of Cadwal and the wide sea itself come between us , I will wed her before I die . Give her to me . " He held out his arms . Terisa saw Geraden burning the way Elega had burned ; she saw him on the verge of hurling something he would n't be able to retract into the teeth of the Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , pulled erect by his fury . Otherwise she could n't have reached him in time . She put a hand on his shoulder , then slipped her arm around his neck and hugged him . " I believe him , " she said softly . " You called him an honorable enemy . He would n't do something like that . And if he did , he would have done it long ago . " He 's going to let us into Orison . " She felt Geraden 's muscles pull tight , as rigid as Elega 's cry . After a moment , she felt them relax . Gently , he shifted Elega into Prince Kragen 's embrace . At once , Kragen sank to the floor , holding Elega close while he checked her pulse and respiration , made her comfortable . He bowed his head over her , ignoring Terisa and Geraden . They stood near him and waited . The sides of the fore-tent were lined with servants and soldiers , summoned by the lady Elega 's wail . They had no instructions , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluttered open . When she saw where she was , a slight smile curved her mouth . Gently , as if she did n't want to hurt him , she put up her hand to touch the Prince 's cheek  |p317He  let out a stiff sigh and raised his head . His voice had to struggle out of his chest . " Why am I going to let you into Orison ? " Geraden cleared his throat . Constricted with emotion , he rasped , " Because if the men who took Queen Madin were Cadwals or mercenaries disguised as Alends , the attack is aimed at you as well as King Joyse . Part of the point is to keep anybody from trusting you . And part of it is to keep you and King Joyse from trusting each other , from forming an alliance . " You 're being manipulated . By High King Festten . And the traitors . And the only way you can save yourself is to let us talk to the King . " " And if I do not let them into Orison " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will believe that I am responsible for your mother 's abduction . " Elega did n't nod or shake her head . The small smile stayed on her lips ; her hand cupped Kragen 's cheek . " You want an alliance , my lord . You have always wanted an alliance , not this misconceived and aimless siege . Perhaps that is possible now . Perhaps it would be worth the attempt . " Prince Kragen made a harsh noise like an attempted laugh . " The last time I proposed that , he humiliated me . He went to considerable lengths to humiliate me . " " He did n't  --  " Terisa began . Her legs were unsteady , however , and she had to support herself on Geraden 's shoulder . For a moment , she forgot what she was saying . Then she remembered . " He was testing you . He thought you were his enemy . He did n't know who the traitor was . He did n't know what alliances had already been made . Now we can tell him . " Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smolder which would have frightened her if she had been able to concentrate on it . Softly , he commanded , " Tell me . " Geraden took a deep breath , straightened his back . " I 'll tell you this much , my lord . The traitor is Master Eremis . We can guess how he does the translations that let him attack anywhere in Mordant  --  that let him and Gart and Master Gilbur move through flat glass without losing their minds . And we know where his power is located , where he keeps his mirrors . "  |p318With  an intensity Terisa did n't quite understand , Prince Kragen demanded , " Where is that ? " When Geraden had described Esmerel and its location , the Prince lowered his head . " My lady , " he asked Elega , " can you stand ? " She nodded . A flick of his fingers brought two servants running forward . They eased the lady out of his arms , assisted her to her feet . At once , Prince Kragen surged upright . He kept his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his expression . Under his breath , he murmured , " I must speak to the Alend Monarch . " Without offering an explanation or waiting for an answer , he entered the darkness of the main tent and closed the flap behind him . While Geraden and Elega studied each other with uncertainty and some embarrassment , Terisa went to refill her goblet . She was stretched out on the floor , sound asleep and snoring gently , when the Alend Contender returned . In a subtle way , his manner had changed . He looked less angry , less sick to the teeth with frustration ; the prospect of immediate battle or danger came as a palpable relief to him . Despite his efforts to sound neutral , his voice was several shades lighter as he announced , " The Alend Monarch has decided that you will be allowed to enter Orison tomorrow morning . " When he said that , Elega 's face shone at him . Geraden let the air out of his tight chest with a burst like a laugh . " Thanks , my lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I 'm glad you do n't hold a grudge against me for stopping Nyle . " He glanced affectionately at Terisa . " She 'll be glad , too  --  when she wakes up . " The Prince nodded brusquely and continued , " I will accompany you , both to demonstrate my good faith and to pursue the Alend Monarch 's desire for an alliance . " " Good idea , " Geraden remarked . " The lady Elega will remain here to ensure that King Joyse does not abuse my good faith . " Elega dropped her eyes , but did n't try to argue . " In the meantime , " Prince Kragen concluded , commanding the attention of his soldiers with a gesture , " it might be advisable top319discontinue our assault on the gates . " He looked at one of his men . " Give the order . " The man saluted and left . The rest of the servants and soldiers also filed out of the fore-tent . To his own surprise , Geraden found that he felt suddenly giddy , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission , my lord , " he said , " I 'll have some more of that strong wine . Then , if you 're interested in the trade Terisa mentioned , I 'll tell you a story that will curl your hair . " Grinning like a predator , the Prince refilled Geraden 's goblet himself.  |p320By  midnight , Prince Kragen and the lady Elega knew mostof Geraden 's secrets . The Alend Contender was an honorable man , however , and he kept his word . While Terisa and Geraden slept the heavy sleep of too much wine , servants carried them to another tent , and put them to bed . At dawn more servants awakened them , offered them baths and food . and clean clothes . According to the servants , Prince Kragen wished his guests to take full advantage of his hospitality . When they were entirely ready , he would approach the castle with them . Terisa felt loggy with sleep , thick-headed with the wine 's aftereffects . She wanted a bath so badly that she could hardly contain herself . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quite meet Geraden 's eyes , she asked awkwardly , " Are you still speaking to me ? " " Of course . " There was a watchful air behind his smile , but no discernible irritation . " If you want me to stop speaking to you , you 're going to have to do something worse than that . " At least he did n't pretend he did n't know what she was talking about . She covered her face with her hands . " Did I make a complete idiot out of myself ? " He chuckled easily . " That 's the amazing part . You scared me ,  |p321all  right . I thought you were going to get us in terrible trouble . But everything you did turned out fine . Even drinking as much as you did may have helped . It made you believable . I do n't think I could have handled either Elega or the Prince without you . " She pulled down her hands . Deliberately , she glared at him . " Stop being so nice to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Geraden gaped like a clown . " You 're right . I 'm sorry . Oh , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . Please forgive me . I 'm so ashamed . " She made a grim but halfhearted effort to kick his shins . Laughing , he caught hold of her , held her , hugged her . After a while , a strange desire to weep came over her , and she found herself clinging to him hard . Fortunately , the desire only lasted a moment . As soon as it faded , she felt better . She had to let go of him to wipe her nose . " Thanks , " she said softly . " Someday I 'll do something nice for you . " It surprised her to see that he was leering . " If we had time , I 'd get you to do it right now . " That brought a smile out of her . " No , you would n't . " She was definitely feeling better . " I stink like a pig . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stuck out his tongue in mock-nausea . She went to take a bath . When they were clean , and dressed in the new clothes Prince Kragen had provided for them  --  comfortable traveling clothes sewn of leather as supple as kidskin  --  they ate breakfast . The impression that they were keeping the Alend Contender waiting nagged at the back of Terisa 's mind ; nevertheless she let him wait so that she would have a last chance to talk to Geraden . She had to prepare herself for Orison . " We 're are n't likely to get much of a welcome , you know , " she said between bites of honeyed bread and souffleed eggs  --  an unexpectedlyrich sample of the Alend Monarch 's hospitality . " I tried to make the Castellan think I might be innocent , but Master Gilbur did a pretty good job of wiping that out . " She did n't mention Artagel . " Everybody there has spent the whole time thinking you killed Nyle and I 'm in league with the arch-Imager . " Geraden nodded . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too worried . We 'll have Prince Kragen with us . We 'll be under a flag of truce.  |p322No  matter what Lebbick and everybody else thinks of us , they 'll leave us alone . " He chewed for a moment in silence , then added , " What I 'm worried about is that mirror  --  the one that attacked the Perdon when he came here to get King Joyse 's help . " Suddenly , Terisa found a sick taste in her mouth . " Did n't Eremis change all that ? He used those creatures to try to kill us outside Sternwall . He may have used them to kill Underwell . What can he still do ? " " Well , he must have switched flat mirrors in the Image of the world where those creatures come from . Otherwise he could n't have attacked us . But he 's had plenty of time since then . He could have switched the mirrors back . " In any case , the point is that he has a glass that shows the approach to Orison , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . He 'll be forewarned . " She thought about that while the taste in her mouth changed to an old , settled anger . Then she muttered , " At least he 'll be surprised . He wo n't have any idea how we managed to talk Prince Krageninto this . " It did her good to be angry . Facing down Castellan Lebbickorthe Tor and Artagel , who had turned against her  --  would be hard enough . But confronting Master Eremis would be worse . The more she loved Geraden , the more her skin crawled at the memory of the things Master Eremis had done to her . She could see Geraden 's eagerness in his eyes , in the way he moved : he was starting to hurry . She had never been as confident or as clear as he was ; but she , too , felt a need for haste . By tacit agreement , they left the remains of their meal . They had nothing to pack , nothing to carry . They kissed each other once , like a promise ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was waiting for them . They caught him in the act of pacing back and forth across the open area among the luxurious tents . He was dressed in his ceremonial garb : a black silk doublet and pantaloons covered by a brass breastplate with a high polish ; a sword in a gleaming brass scabbard on his hip ; a spiked brass helmet on his curling hair . The sheen of the metal emphasized his swarthy skin ; it made his black eyes glitter and his moustache shine . And his im/patience only increased the self-assertion of his bearing , emphasizing his habit of command . Three horses were held ready beyond the tents . They , too , were dressed for show , with satin and silk streaming from their saddles and tack , gilt cords knotted into their manes and tails . Around them , an honor guard was already mounted : ten men to carry the Prince 's pennon , and his dignity . Terisa did n't see Elega anywhere . Prince Kragen nodded to Geraden , bowed to Terisa . In a tightly reined voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you  --  and to her father  --  but she can not bid you farewell . She has already been placed under guard . The Alend Monarch intends to assure that no mistakes are made with us , and the lady Elega is his only means to that end . Even I do not know where she is held . Therefore I can not enable the King 's men  --  or his Imagers  --  to find her . " Terisa swallowed hard . The sun was up , but it did n't seem to be enjoying its work . The light over the encampment and against the walls of Orison was thin , unconvincing ; the air had a cold taste , more like a residue of winter than a part of spring . The castle 's battlementslooked bleak , as if they had been abandoned . If anything happened to her and Geraden there  --  but especially if anything happened to Prince Kragen  --  Elega would be in serious trouble . " My lord Prince "  --  Geraden changed the subject awkwardly  --  " you must have heard about the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about it himself , surely Elega did ? " " Yes . " A subtle shift in his expression suggested that Prince Kragen was glad to discuss something other than Elega . " But I must confess that I am baffled . Our siege engines have no approach to the gates , except along the road . Our rams must pass through the Image which struck at the Perdon . Yet nothing has been translated against us . " You have told me that Master Eremis is in league with Cadwal to destroy Mordant  --  and Alend as well . For that reason , his power has been used to defend Orison against us . Yet we are now within hours  --  within a day at most  --  of breaking down the gates , and he has done nothing to hinder us . " Breaking down the gates . Terisa 's stomach twisted . So it was now or never . If she and Geraden could n't get King Joyse to accept an alliance , Orison would fall almost immediately.  |p324The  muscles along Geraden 's jaw bunched ; but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't admit it . " He probably has n't given you trouble , " he said , " because you have n't been attacking very hard . If you 're about to break in , and he still is n't using Imagery , I 'd guess his trap is just about ready to spring . " Prince Kragen nodded darkly . Without a word , he beckoned for the horses and his honor guard . In a moment , Terisa found herself being offered a charger so big that she could n't see over its back . Oh , shit , she muttered to herself . That was one thing she had learned in Mordant , anyway : after some practice , she was now able to say oh , shit without sounding like she expected to have her mouth washed out with soap . If she fell off that beast , she might take days to hit the ground . Unfortunately , Prince Kragen had already mounted ; Geraden was swinging up into the saddle of his horse . This probably would n't be a good time to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charger 's back . The reins carried so many streamers that they looked like the lines of a maypole . She was afraid to move them : they might make her horse shy . But Prince Kragen and Geraden were n't having any trouble . Apparently , these beasts were trained for ceremonial occasions . Nothing embarrassing happened as she guided her mount to Geraden 's side . " Simply as a precaution , " the Prince announced , " we will avoid the road . We will ride to the walls directly , and around them to the gates . " Geraden seemed to think that made sense . Prince Kragen nodded to his honor guard . His standard-bearer raised the green-and-red pennon of Alend , then affixed a flag of truce below it . The soldiers took their formal positions around their Prince and his companions . In formation , the riders left the encampment . The charger 's strides made the distance shorter than it had any right to be . Before she had time to accustom herself to the beast 's gait , Terisa found herself moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see men on the walls now , watching , pointing ; some of them hurried from place to place . She tried to stifle the fear that they would ignore the flag of truce and start firing , but it refused to go away.  |p325Luckily  , there was still some common sense left in Orison . None of the men on the battlements bent their bows . None of them made any threatening gestures . Instead , the castle 's trumpeter winded his horn , sending a forlorncall like a wail of defiance into the skeptical sunlight . As the riders rounded the corner of Orison and neared the entrance , they heard the great winches squeal against the strain of raising the batteredand deformed gates up into the architrave . Terisa felt nothing to indicate that a translation had ever taken place near here . In formation , Prince Kragen and his company crossed the bare ground to the road in front of the gates . Castellan Lebbick and ten of his men came out on horseback to meet them . Seeing the Castellan filled Terisa 's stomach with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses fretted because they had n't had enough exercise . In contrast , he looked too obsessed and singlemindedfor nervousness . His eyes were red and raw , dangerously aggrieved ; he moved as if the violence coiled in his muscles might burst out at any moment . His features were sharp with anticipation  --  almost with yearning . " My lord Prince . " He bared his teeth : maybe he was trying to smile . " You 've got strange friends . A fratricide and a traitor . I never thought I was going to see either of them again . " " Castellan Lebbick . " Prince Kragen lacked Lebbick 's air of madness , but he matched the Castellan 's tone . " Geraden and the lady Terisa accompany me under a flag of truce . I have no interest in your opinion of them . You will respect the flag . " " Oh , of course . They 're as safe as babies . Especially since they 're with you . You 're the man who intends to break down my gates . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince Kragen clenched his jaws . Before he could speak , however , Geraden said hotly , " Castellan , I did n't kill my brother . " His face was flushed ; anger glinted from his eyes . Hints of authority echoed in his voice . " Terisa is n't a traitor . It 's time for you to start believing us . You 're doomed if you do n't . " The Castellan actually laughed  --  a rough sound like a piece of stone being crushed . " Believe you ? I believe you . I do n't need you to tell me I 'm doomed . That 's not the problem . "  |p326Prince  Kragen contained himself . " What is the problem , Castellan ? " " The problem , my lord Prince , " retorted Lebbick fiercely , " is that I 'm the only one . Nobody else here cares enough . Nobody else is desperate enough . " Terisa recoiled from his vehemence . She did n't want to know what he was talking about : she wanted to get away from him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost panting . " Did I hear you right , Castellan ? " he demanded . " Did I just hear you admit Terisa and I are innocent ? " " No . " The Castellan bared his teeth again . " You heard me say I believe you . They all think I 'm insane . If I said the sun is shining today , the people in there "  --  he indicated Orison with a twitch of his head  --  " would run to get out of the rain . " Nobody cares what a crazy man believes . Besides "  --  he shrugged maliciously  --  " I might be wrong . " " Castellan Lebbick . " Prince Kragen spoke harshly , trying to gain control of the situation . " We will discuss the question of your sanity at another time . As you may guess , Geraden and the lady Terisa have traveled widely since they departed Orison . They bring news . I must have an audience with King Joyse . " " An audience ? " Lebbick snapped back at once , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Joyse to hear is either false or dangerous . They 're going to scream for your heart 's blood when I let you in . Of course you can have an audience . " Wheeling his horse as if the matter were settled , he faced his men . Counting off four of them , he ordered , " Tell King Joyse . I 'm going to take Kragen and these two to the hall of audiences . Tell him there are going to be riots unless he backs me up . We 'll have to kill people to keep the Prince and his friends alive if King Joyse does n't come to the hall . " At once , Prince Kragen put in grimly , " And tell him also that the lady Elega is being kept hostage . Until now , she has been an honored guest and friend of the Alend Monarch . To ensure my safety , however , she has been deprived of her freedom . " He spoke as if he intended to make someone pay for the necessity which compelledhim to let Elega @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to me , or to my companions , she will be hurt as well . " Tell King Joyse that . " " Oh , of course , my lord Prince , " the Castellan grated withoutp327looking at Kragen . " I burn to do everything you command . My men will keep you alive . Somehow . " His four guards rode back into the courtyard . Terisa saw them dismount , saw them head at a run for one of the inner doorways . " Come on , " added Lebbick . He might have been speaking to the wall stretching high above his head over the gates . " Or ride back to Margonal and admit you have n't got the bare courage to do whateverit is you 've got in mind . " With his remaining men , he reentered the mouth of Orison . Prince Kragen stared at the Castellan 's back . He made no effort to lower his voice . " That man has lost his mind . " Still aching inside , Terisa murmured , " King Joyse cut the ground out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have anything else to live for except his loyalty , and the King made him look like a fool for being loyal . " " A pitiful tale , " rasped the Prince . Obviously , he had no patiencefor Lebbick 's problems . " Sadly , it does not tell us whether or not he can be trusted . Will he not have us killed as soon as we cross that threshold ? " " Suit yourself . " Abruptly , Geraden jerked up his charger 's head . " I trust him . I 'm going in . " Breaking formation , he started for the gates . Prince Kragen swore at him , ordered him back . Terisa was alreadyfollowing him , however , urging her mount almost onto his horse 's heels . The Prince and his guard had no choice but to enter Orison behind Geraden and Terisa . As she passed through the thick stone wall into the protected rectangle of the courtyard , her pulse went up a beat . In spite of her numerous anxieties  --  or perhaps because of them  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The interior faces of the castle loomed above her , crowded with spectators , punctuated with clotheslines . Castellan Lebbick had dismountedin the mud . When the Alend party approached him , he saluted with withering sarcasm . At once , his guards took the heads of the horses and held them so that Prince Kragen and his people could dismount in an orderly fashion . Pulling her leg hesitantly off the back of the charger , Terisa found herself caught and lifted down in Artagel 's grasp . He embraced her as if she were dear to him . " Artagel ! " He had hurt her once , badly . On the other hand , hep328was Geraden 's brother ; she knew most of his family . And his hug was as eloquent as an apology . Instinctively , she flung her arms around his neck . After a moment , he pushed her away and gave her a lopsided , rather embarrassed grin . " Be careful , my lady . " He rolled his eyes at Geraden . " We do n't want to make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his brother ; he grabbed Artagel , shook him , hugged him , thumped his back . " How are you , how 's your side , are you all right , what 's going on here , what 's the matter with Lebbick ? " Geraden 's face shone with joy . " Do you realize how long it 's been since I saw you well ? I can tell you , the Domne had some stern things to say about letting yourself get hurt like that . " " ' Da , " ' Terisa put in happily . " You promised to call him Da . " ' Artagel 's smile told her everything she needed to know . Now she was just glad that she had never told Geraden about Artagel 's distrust . Nevertheless Artagel 's next words reassured her further . Insteadof trying to answer Geraden 's questions , he commented half casually , " I heard what he said . " He nodded toward the Castellan . " We all heard him . Actually , he is n't the only one who believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minority . " Terisa beamed with pleasure and relief . " Do n't worry about it , " said Geraden . " We 'll get that straightenedout as soon as we see King Joyse . Tell me something important . How 's your side ? " Artagel laughed easily . " Terrible . All this rest is giving me the twitches . " Humorously , he whispered , " If I do n't get to fight somebodysoon , I 'm going to end up like Lebbick . " " My lady Terisa . Geraden . " Prince Kragen addressed them coldly , but his expression was one of bemusement rather than irritation . " It might be wise to conduct this reunion later . The present circumstances are less than cordial . We must meet with King Joyse promptly . " Artagel laughed again . " He 's right . First things first . I 'll follow you to the hall . When you 're done there , we 'll talk . " Waving his hand cheerfully , he retreated among the horses and guards . When Terisa looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears.  |p329He  was happy : she knew he was happy . He loved Artagel . For that reason , she was surprised by the pain on his face . Until she noticed Geraden 's pain , she did n't absorb the fact that Artagel moved with a slight limp , as if he had an unhealed stiffness in his side . And he was n't carrying a sword . Oh , Artagel ! Had Gart hurt him that badly ? Or had his long sequence of overexertions and relapses aggravated the damage enough to cripple him ? A swordsman of Artagel 's prowess did n't have to be maimed or broken to be crippled . A few muscles which did n't heal properly in his side could do it . " It 's too much , Terisa , " Geraden gritted between his teeth . " Too many people have been hurt . Too much harm has been done . This has got to stop . We 've got to stop him . " She put her arm through his and squeezed it : she knew whom he was talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her stomach that a lot more people were going to be hurt soon . " Come on , " she murmured so that Prince Kragen would n't summonthem again . " If we 're going to stop him , this is the way to do it . " Geraden nodded ; he scrubbed the expression of sorrow off his face . Together , he and Terisa joined the Prince and Castellan Lebbick . Lebbick considered them balefully . He did n't look like a man who believed them . He also did n't sound like a man who believed them . Without preamble , he asserted , " You 'll leave your men here , my lord Prince . " Prince Kragen stiffened . " What an odd idea , Castellan . Why would I do such a thing ? " The Castellan 's mouth twisted . " I understand your problem . You do n't think you 're safe here . Well , I have a problem , too . I could be wrong about you . You could be plotting treachery . " If you 're honest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll die before you do . But if you are n't  --  " He shrugged . " You 'll leave your men in the courtyard . " Prince Kragen 's fingers stroked the hilt of his sword lightly . His demeanor was unruffled , but Terisa could sense his ire . Softly , hep330asked , " Are you so unconcerned about the lady Elega 's position , Castellan ? " Castellan Lebbick returned a snort . " She is n't my daughter . I do n't care what happens to her . I 'm in command of Orison . If you make me cut you down , King Joyse will never know the difference . I 'll report it any way I like . " He faced the Prince , daring the Alend Contender to doubt him . The darkness in Prince Kragen 's eyes scared Terisa . She thought she ought to do something , intervene somehow . But Geraden was holding her arm now ; he kept her still . After a moment , the Prince said , " If you had come to me , Castellan , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " remarked Lebbick succinctly . Prince Kragen 's jaws bunched ; blood deepened the hue of his skin . After a moment , however , he nodded . " My guard will wait outside the gates . If we do not return in an hour , they will ride to the Alend Monarch . The lady Elega will be killed . Tell King Joyse what you will . " Castellan Lebbick gave another of his crushed-rock laughs . " Let the Alends wait outside the gates , " he told one of his men . " Be civil about it . Keep the gates open . " Without waiting for a reply , he headed toward the nearest doorway . Prince Kragen glanced at Terisa , at Geraden . She chewed her lip ; but Geraden assented promptly . " It 's the best chance we 've got . He 's never stabbed anybody in the back . " " You are a bad influence , " murmured Prince Kragen , " both of you . You urge me to accept horrifying risks as if they were entirely plausible . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to become more cautious . " Smiling ominously , he led Terisa and Geraden after the Castellan . Inside the castle , past the guards at the door , the halls were deserted . The spectators who packed the inner windows and balconieswere nowhere to be seen ; every indication of Orison 's overcrowdingwas gone . " Curfew , " Castellan Lebbick explained as he strode along the echoing passage . " I thought you were going to break through the gates today . I ordered everybody out of the way . Nobody'sallowed to use the halls except the King 's guard . " He may have intended his explanation to be reassuring . Never/theless the unnatural silence of the place plucked at Terisa 's nerves . She seemed to feel vast numbers of people crouched out of sight , waitingRumors would travel fast in a besieged castle . When enough people heard that Nyle 's murderer and Master Quillon 's murderer and the Alend Contender were in Orison , the curfew would n't hold . No curfew would hold . And when it broke , what would Lebbick do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all there was to it . He had to listen . He had to believe them . Otherwise she and Geraden and even Prince Kragen might not live long enough to find out what Master Eremis ' trap actually was . They were obviously being watched . She did n't see anybody , but she could hear voices . Just a murmur at first , an impression of whispering which filled the corridors with hints of menace . Then the voices grew louder , bolder . One of them said , " Killer . " Another called out clearly , " Butcher ! " Castellan Lebbick did n't glance aside . He did n't seem to hear the voices . Or maybe he approved of them . He waited until they faded behind him . Then , to no one in particular , he commented , " They do n't mean you . They mean me . " The way he walked was so tightly controlled that it made his whole body appear brittle . He took Terisa , Geraden , and Prince Kragen directly to the audience hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pennons , they approached a set of peaked doors . Like the ones to the courtyard , those doors were guarded . Terisa took that as a good sign . She held Geraden 's arm and tried to keep her respiration steady as the guards opened the doors into the hall of audiences . She remembered it vividly  --  its cathedrallike height and length ; the walls covered by carved wooden screens , their finials reaching twenty or thirty feet toward the vaulted ceiling ; the two narrow windowshigh in the far wall . Working on short notice , a flustered old servant hurried along the rows of candles , past the batteries of lamps , trying to light them all as fast as he could . He still had a long way to go ; yet he  --  and the windows  --  already gave enough illumination to show King Joyse 's ornate mahogany throne on its pediment . A run of rich carpet led from the doors to the pediment ; the rest of the wide area in front of the throne was open , surrounded by benchesp332like pews . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs reached toward the benches . Because the light was so dim , the balcony surrounding the hall above the screens was shrouded in darkness . Terisa could see well enough , however , to note that the Castellan already had guards in position . Archers ranged there along the walls of the hall , four on each side . Two pikemen closed the doors and stood to hold them . Four more were at attention beside the King 's seat . She counted them again : fourteen guards . Sourly , she supposed that Lebbick 's refusal to permit the attendance of Prince Kragen 's honor guard made sense . If the Castellan could only produce fourteen guards , Kragen 's ten soldiers might have been sufficient to protect him from the consequences of treachery . Then , as the old servant continued to do his job , and the light improved , she realized that the benches and chairs were n't empty . The gathering was small , compared to the one which had greeted Prince Kragen 's first visit . Terisa suspected , however , that the people here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no lords or ladies whose sole claim to significance arose from birth or wealth . Around the benches were several more guards , each wearing the insignia of a captain : Lebbick 's seconds-in-command . Artagel sat among them , grinning encouragement . She saw some of King Joyse 's counselors , men she had met only once before : the Lord of Commerce , for example ; the Home Ambassador ; the Lord of the Privy Purse . And in the chairsTo the right of the throne sat the Tor , sprawling his bulk over at least two chairs . To all appearances , he had n't changed his robe since Terisa had last seen him : it was crumpled and filthy , so badly stained that it looked like it would never come clean . The dull red in his eyes and the way his flesh sagged from the bones of his face gave the impression that he was drunk . If he recognized either Terisa or Geraden , he did n't show it . As if to avoid him  --  as if he stank or had lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The men there were Masters . Terisa knew Barsonage , of course : the mediator was scowling at her as if she had betrayed everything he valued . And most of the Imagers with him she had seen before . But at least one of them looked so unfamiliar  --  and so young  --  thatp333she thought he must be an Apt who had just recently earned his chasuble . Two of the three of them were breathing hard . They must have come at a run . After all , the Castellan 's men had n't had much time to summon people to this audience . The reason for the attendance of the Masters was obvious . King Joyse had threatened to defend Orison with Imagery . To do that , he needed the support of the Congery . The Imagers made her think of Master Quillon , and her heart twisted . Then she realized that Adept Havelock was missing . The High King 's Dastard was n't in the hall anywhere . Neither was Master Eremis , however . That was a relief . Soundless on the carpet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down a few places away from the Tor , leaving Prince Kragen , Geraden , and Terisa in the open space before the throne . Inconsequently , she noticed the burned spot on the rug , where Havelock had once dropped his censer . No one had bothered to mend it . King Joyse had n't had much use for his audience hall in recent years . He did n't have much use for it now , apparently . He was n't present . Prince Kragen surveyed the hall ; he scanned the balconies . The corner of his moustache lifted as if he were sneering . When he had completed his study of the King 's defenses , he said clearly , " Remarkable . Is this the best audience King Joyse can produce ? If an ambassador came to the Alend Monarch , at least a hundred nobles would commemorate the occasion , regardless of the hour  --  or the urgency . " A moment later , however , he remarked politely , " Most impressive , Castellan . For the first time , I truly believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not need so many men  --  and so many witnesses  --  to procure our deaths . " What do you intend ? Where is King Joyse ? " Castellan Lebbick remained sitting . In a voice which resembled his laugh , he barked , " Norge ! " Slowly , almost casually , one of the captains stood and came to attention . He saluted the Castellan calmly . In fact , everything about him seemed calm . He sounded like he was talking in his sleep . " My lord Castellan ? " " Norge , where is King Joyse ? " demanded Lebbick.  |p334Norge  shrugged comfortably . " I spoke to him myself , my lord Castellan . I told him what you said . I even told him what the Prince said . He said , Then you 'd better get the audience hall ready . " ' Apparently , the captain did n't think any other comment was necessary . He sat down . Terisa heard a door open and close as the servant left , his job done . Castellan Lebbick faced the Prince . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as I do . Are you satisfied ? " " No , Castellan , " put in King Joyse . " I doubt that he knows as much as you do . And I 'm sure he is n't satisfied . " Somehow , Terisa had missed the King 's arrival . He must have entered from a door hidden behind his seat : she jumped to that conclusion because he was beside the pediment now , with one hand braced on the base of the throne as if he were about to go up the four or five steps and sit down . Nevertheless she had n't seen him come in . For all she knew , he had appeared by Imagery . He was wearing what she took to be his formal attire : a robe of purple velvet , not especially clean ; a circlet of gold to keep his white hair off his forehead . And from a brocade strap over his right shoulder hung a tooled sheath which held a longsword with a jeweled pommel . His blue eyes were as watery and vague as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inflexible . The way he moved conveyed the impression that he was frail under his robe , barely able to support his own weight ; too frail for dignity or decision . Only his beard had changed . It had been trimmed short and neatly combed . Under his white whiskers , his cheeks showed a flush of exertion or wine . At once , everyone stood . A bit too slowly for decorum , Lebbick stood also and bowed . " Attend , " he drawled by way of announcement . " This audience is granted to Prince Kragen , the Alend Contender , by Joyse , Lord of the Demesne and King of Mordant . It 's a private audience . Everyone here is commanded to speak freely  --  and to say nothing when they have left the hall . To speak outside of what is said here is treason . " Bitterly , as if he had no use for the King 's permission , he sat down . No one else sat . Even Lebbick 's captains remained on their feet while King Joyse looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental note of everyone present . Meeting Terisa 's gaze , and Ger/aden 's , he scowled so dramatically that she was tempted to think he did n't mean it ; tempted to think he was scowling to conceal a leap of joy . She had no way of knowing the truth , however . Instead of addressing her or Geraden  --  or the audience generally  --  he turned abruptly and ascended his seat , dragging his sword upward like a millstone . When he reached his throne , he collapsed into it ; he had to pause and breathe deeply for a moment before he was able to tell the gathering to sit . The assembled captains and counselors and Imagers obeyed . Of course , Prince Kragen , Terisa , and Geraden had to remain standing . Her reaction to the sight of King Joyse was more complex than she had expected : she was at once gladder and more distressed . He had a strange power which always surprised her , an attraction of personality that made her want to believe he was still as strong and idealistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been . That was why his appearance upset her . He was simply too weak . There on his throne , with Mordant in shambles , and Eremis poised to strike the last , crushing blow , he was too close to his grave  --  the burial ground as much of his spirit as of his decaying frame . She understood why Geraden loved him . Oh , she understood . Everything in her chest ached because he was n't equal to the love people gave him anymore . Somebody else would have to save Orison and Mordant . He seemed to share her opinion . In a dry , querulous tone that made him sound nearly decrepit , he said without preamble , " You first , Kragen . And be quick about it . I do n't have much patience for men who threaten my daughters . " Prince Kragen 's fists knotted on his anger ; he held his voice steady . " Then you must have no patience at all for yourself , my lord King . I have come because I have news which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lady Terisa  --  and in part to other sources of knowledge  --  I have an astonishing range of threats to lay before you . But they are all of your own making , not mine . Even the lady Elega is entirely safe  --  unless you have lost even the small honesty necessary to respect a flag of truce . " Unexpectedly , the Tor let out a snorting noise like a snore . His eyes seemed to be falling closed ; his head began to loll on his thick neck . " Whoreslime , " commented Castellan Lebbick unceremon/iously . " You must have noticed that we 're besieged . Maybe you 've even noticed that you 're the one besieging us . " When King Joyse did n't intervene to silence the Castellan , Terisa'sheart sank . The King had to listen , had to . He had to understand . Nevertheless he did n't look capable of understanding  --  and he did n't seem to be listening . He only stared at Prince Kragen as if the Alend Contender 's presence were no more pleasant  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my lord King . " Prince Kragen did what he could , under the circumstances : he treated Lebbick 's words as if they came from King Joyse . " Even that threat you have brought upon yourself . When I first came to you seeking an alliance , you humiliated me deliberately . And since that time your only ambition has been to destroy your realm before you die . You forget that Alend also is bound up in Mordant 's need . You created the Congery , my lord King , and now you must face the consequences . If the power of all Imagery falls to High King Festten , our ruin is certain . We must fight for our survival . Even dogs will do as much . If you are determined to let the Congery fall to Cadwal , then we have no choice but to prevent you as best we can . The Prince had moved a step closer to King Joyse . Terisa and Geraden were on either side of him , a bit behind . Across Prince Kragen 's back , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . We 've got to do something . " A clenched glitter filled Geraden 's gaze . " My lord King  --  " he murmured as if the words stuck in his throat . " My lord King , please . Give us a chance . " King Joyse paid no attention to him . " No , my lord Prince . " Master Barsonage glared from under his shrubbery eyebrows . He did n't stand . On the other hand , he did speak courteously . " Your view of the situation is persuasive , but not entirely fair . You forget that the Congery is composed of Imagers  --  and Imagers are also men . Like yourself , we must fight for our survival . Unlike you , however , we are men who have accepted the King 's ideals , the King 's purposes . Oh , there are some among us who serve the Congery only because they dislike the alternatives available to them . But they are few , my lord Prince  --  only a minority . The rest of us value what we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to High King Festten when Mordant collapses ?  | " You say you must keep the Congery from falling into Cadwal 's hands , and that is a worthy endeavor , I am sure . But the assumption on which your actions are based is that the Congery is a thing , not men  --  that we do not choose , or believe , or have worth as men . " Why do you believe you have the right to determine our survival  --  andour allegiance  --  for us ? " Prince Kragen received this argument with a closed face . Once again , he treated what was said as if it came from King Joyse . Only the sweat at his temples betrayed the pressure he felt . " A fascinating debate , my lord King , " he said grimly , " but irrelevant . We can not leave Alend 's future in the hands of men who are so confused  --  either by Imagery itself , or by the necessity of achieving decisions through debate  --  that they believed the translationof an uncontrollable battle-champion to be a sensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will defend you , as they must . Nevertheless the responsibility for this siege is yours . " King Joyse shrugged . At least he was listening well enough to know that Prince Kragen had paused . He gave the Prince a chance to go on , then said abruptly , " I know all this . Tell me something I do n't know . Tell me about your astonishing range of threats . ' The Tor snorted again , softly , and opened one eye . " So Terisa and Geraden are traitors after all , " he rumbled . He was lost in a world of wine . " How sad . " At once , he closed his eye again , dismissingwhatever happened around him . " In any case , my lord Prince , " the Castellan grated as if King Joyse had n't spoken , " you do have choices . We 've already told you what they are . Withdraw to a safe position . Wait and see what happens . If you do that , King Joyse is willing to meet Margonal under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she heard that , a small flame of hope leaped up in Terisa . And was quenched immediately . Before Prince Kragen could reply , King Joyse muttered shakily , " No , Castellan . It 's too late for that . It 's too late for anything . " It 's time for the truth . " His swollen hands gripped the arms of his seat ; he had trouble holding himself upright . Almost whining , he said to the Prince , " Tell me about your threats . Tell me what Terisa and Geraden know . Tell me why you stopped beating on my gates . " Under his whining , however , lay an iron blade , too well whetted and keen to be mistaken . All the light in the hall seemed to shine on him . " Tell me now . "  |p338A  tight silence closed around the onlookers . Terisa could n't bear to look at King Joyse any longer . She glanced at Geraden , saw him chewing the inside of his cheek ; his eyes were wide and white , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to the throne than she did , she could n't see most of his face ; but she could see a twitch run down the long muscle of his jaw , a bead of sweat trail from his temple across his cheekbone . Ignoring the proprieties of a royal audience , she turned her head and caught Artagel 's eye ; she was looking for inspiration . He did n't have any to give her , however . He looked stretched and pale , as if he were stifling nausea . Still avoiding the King , she faced Master Barsonage . You 're wrong about us . That was what she ought to say to him . All the assumptions here are wrong . Geraden did n't kill Nyle . I did n't kill Master Quillon . But she did n't say anything . The silence held her . Why were Geraden and Prince Kragen sweating ? Surely the air was cooler than that ? Prince Kragen 's fist sprang involuntarily from his side ; he forced it down again . " No , " he said through his teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castellan Lebbick 's face . He was going to laugh . Or wail . " Why not , Prince ? Why else did you come ? " Kragen ignored the Castellan . " I will not suffer this senseless treatment . I will not trade my only hopes to a King so contemptible that he respects no one else . " Despite his efforts to speak quietly , his voice grew thick with passion until he was nearly shouting . " The lady Elega persuaded me to come . Apt Geraden and the lady Terisa persuaded me . They are all deluded by the idea that their lord remainspossessed of some vestige of wisdom  --  or of courage  --  or of bare decency . " To Terisa , every word sounded like a nail being driven into the lid of Mordant 's coffin . " Do you hear me , Joyse ? " Prince Kragen raged . " You are deaf to everything else . You are deaf to the misery of your people , locked in a useless siege  --  caught in Cadwal 's path  --  slaughtered by renegadeImagers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wisdom and the necessity of dealing fairly with other monarchs . You are deaf to love , deaf to the loyalty which destroys your friends and family . " " Enough , my lord Prince . " King Joyse raised one hand . " I havep339heard you . " Now he did n't sound querulous . And he did n't sound angry . He sounded oddly like a man who was experiencing a personal vindication . " You have said enough . " But Prince Kragen had gone too far to stop . For a second , he let his fists pound the air . " By the stars , Joyse , it is not enough . You will not pull Alend down in Mordant 's ruin . I will not allow it . " I will tell you nothing ! " Abruptly , he wheeled away from the throne . Catching hold of Terisa and Geraden , he pulled them with him toward the doors . Instinctively , she wrenched her arm out of his grasp . She had n't made a conscious decision , either against him or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hurt by the difference between what was needed and what was happening , so urgent for another outcome that she could n't bear to give up . Geraden was clearer . He , too , jerked free of Prince Kragen . Swinging toward the throne , he cried out like a trumpet , " My lord King  --  ! Houseldon is destroyed . Sternwall is falling . The people of Fayle are butchered by ghouls . Your people , my lord King , everywhere ! " King Joyse was on his feet . Terisa had n't seen him stand : she only saw him standing now , towering over her on the pediment with his beard thrust forward and his hair full of light . " And ? " he demanded . " And ? " As if he left her no choice , she replied , " And the Queen is gone . She 's been abducted . " Then her stomach knotted as if she were about to be sick . The idea that he would crumple now , that she had hurt the King hard enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kragen was shouting , " You fools ! He will have me killed ! " Too late . She turned leer back on King Joyse , hugged her arms over her belly . A movement on the balcony caught her eye . She cast a glance upward in time to see one of the archers fold to the floor . Hands grabbed her , spun her . King Joyse had come down from his seat so fast that she did n't have time to think , to react ; he clenched his fists in her soft shirt . Shouting the King 's name , Geraden tried to intervene . King Joyse thrust him away . " Who took her ? " The king seemed to swell over Terisa . His eyes were blue fire ; his teeth flashed ; he shook her as if her heart were an empty sack . " I 'll have that man 's head ! Who took her ? "  |p340Terisa  struggled to turn her head , look back up at the balcony . But King Joyse was shaking her too hard ; she could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried Geraden . " She was taken by Alends ! " So suddenly that Terisa nearly fell , King Joyse dropped her . His sword came into his hands swiftly , catching the light like a whip of fire . She stumbled around to scan the balcony . Three of the archers were down . The rest were so engrossed in the scene below them that they had n't realized what was happening . King Joyse and Prince Kragen confronted each other . The Prince had drawn his own blade : the tips of their swords danced at each other in the glow of the lamps and candles . " Where is she ? " demanded the King . Wildly , Geraden pushed himself between the blades . " They were dressed like Alends ! " he panted . " We think it 's a trick ! Prince Kragen came here to prove his good faith ! " Before his King could cut him down , he added , " Torrent went after her . She 's going to leave a trail for help to follow . " " The balcony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear herself . Shielded by Geraden , Prince Kragen lowered his sword . Facing King Joyse regally over Geraden 's shoulder , he avowed , " My lord King , I spit on the men who did this to you . And I spit on the cheap ploy which made them appear Alend . I would rather die than become a man who can only gain his ends by violence against women . " He was too late : the blow which felled him was already in motion . Too quickly for any reaction  --  even from King Joyse  --  Artagel reared up behind the Prince and chopped him so hard across the back of the neck that he went down as if he had been hit with an axe . At the same time , Castellan Lebbick cried like a howl of glee , " Gart ! " Terisa could see the High King 's Monomach now . As the fourth archer went down , Gart rounded the balcony to attack those on the other side . He was black and swift , a slash of midnight , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining archers had their bows ready to protect King Joyse from Prince Kragen . Instantly , they shifted their aim toward Gart and let fly.  |p341Unfortunately  , he was n't alone . He had a number of his Apts with him . Swooping like shadows , they caught the archers from behind , hacking the guards down , spoiling their aim . Only one of the arrows went true . Gart knocked the shaft aside with the flat of his blade . His return stroke beheaded the nearest archer . The head flopped lopsidedly over the balcony railing and fell among the benches with a thud . Men yelled everywhere . Castellan Lebbick roared , " I 'm coming , you bastard ! I 'm coming ! " and sprinted toward a door hidden behind one of the screens . Most of the Imagers started to flee . Master Barsonagelashed them back to his side with curses . Geraden cried at Artagel uselessly , " You idiot ! " " I did n't know ! " retorted Artagel . Looking frantic and self-disgusted , he flung a glance up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't decide what to do . In spite of his uncertainty , however , he did n't hesitate to help himself to Prince Kragen 's sword . Laconic in the tumult , Norge demanded reinforcements . Two of the captains headed out of the hall to rally Orison ; the rest of Lebbick 's men followed him toward the stairwell to the balcony . The noise awakened the Tor . He opened his eyes with a snuffle and gazed around blearily . Terisa felt that she was still watching the severed head flop off the balcony and fall . The sound when it hit the bench was unmistakable : she would remember it for the rest of her life . She had to get out of the way , but for some reason she could n't move . Geraden turned toward the Masters : she thought she heard him ask , " Can you fight ? Have you got mirrors with you ? " The strain around Ar-t agel 's eyes was clear as he hefted the Prince 's blade ; he moved stiffly . She knew as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go after Gart  --  that he feared to go because he was no match for the High King 's Monomach . Distinctly , she heard a Master snap , We brought none . How could we know that mirrors would be needed in the audience hall ? " She really ought to get moving . Before ( ; art or his Apts had a chance to come after her . Instead of moving , she waited until she felt a touch of cold as thin as a feather and as sharp as steel slide straight through the center of her abdomen . Then she flipped forward , dove to the floor , rolled away . Whenp342she got her feet under her again , she ran toward Geraden and the Masters . Out of the air where she had been standing stepped Master Gilbur and Master Eremis . Master Gilbur gripped his dagger in one fist . The hunch of his back and the thickness of his arms made his hands look as powerful as battering rams . Master Eremis carried a sword in a scabbard belted around his jet cloak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however . A mirror the size and shape of a roofing tile . With a precision that seemed like lunacy , she noticed that both men still wore their chasubles . Immediately , Master Gilbur leaped to attack Prince Kragen . Grinning happily , Master Eremis came toward Terisa and Geraden . There were no guards to oppose them . Norge 's reinforcements had n't arrived . And the rest of the men had followed Castellan Lebbick . Lebbick burst out onto the balcony with his sword in both hands , snarling for blood . And he almost caught Gart . Unfamiliar with the stairwell , Gart could n't know where it opened ; out of ignorance , he had placed himself in an awkward position . Nevertheless he countered Lebbick 's first cut , blocked it against the railing so hard that chips flew . Retreating nimbly , he countered the backstroke . That gave him all the time he needed to recover his balance . Behind the Castellan , six guards and as many captains led by Norge rushed from the stairwell one at a time to engage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were badly outnumbered . But the balcony was too narrow for any two men to stand and fight abreast . Gart blocked Lebbick on one side ; on the other , an Apt battled the first pikeman to come at him . The rest of the defenders were caught in the middle , helpless . Gart struck furiously , trying to jam his opponents against each other ; he almost succeeded at driving the Castellan backward . Lebbickslipped one blow , blocked a second which hit hard enough to jar his joints and leave a notch on his blade . But he was happy at last , nearly ecstatic at the chance to fight without restraint . Savage joy lit his face as he held Gart 's attack.  | " Bastard ! " he panted . " I 'll teach you to think you can do what you want in my castle ! " Behind him , unfortunately , the first pikeman did n't fare as well . The guard probably had n't had a fraction of the training given to Gart 's Apts . He stumbled ; and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment of surprise while he fell to cut halfway through the nearest captain 's chest . Norge stooped , snatched up one of the bows . So placidly that he did n't seem to be hurrying , he flipped a shaft into the Apt 's throat . Across the hall , one of Gart 's men recklessly flung a dagger . It should have missed from that distance : its target should have seen it coming . Unluckily , he did n't . The guard went down with the blade buried in his left eye . Norge shot the Apt cleanly in the chest . Gart 's gaze swept the balcony . He took in the positions of the people below him . Instead of ripping Castellan Lebbick 's parries aside , the High King 's Monomach began to give ground . Artagel watched what was happening above him for one more moment , then turned his attention to Master Gilbur . Plainly , Gilbur intended to kill the Alend Contender . It was also plain that he was n't going to succeed . Artagel 's side was sore and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nevertheless he could have handled a lone Imager armed with only a dagger in his sleep . " Guard the Prince ! " shouted the Tor for no discernible reason . He was on his feet , his legs splayed , swaying under the influence of too much wine . Smiling pleasantly , Artagel aimed Prince Kragen 's sword  --  and barely saved himself when Master Gilbur turned suddenly , picked yip one of the benches , and hurled it at his head . A corner of the bench punched his shoulder , and he went down ; he hit the floor heavily , lost his direction . The Master 's strength was prodigious . How was it possible to fight somebody who could throw benches around with one hand ? Shock numbed Artagel 's shoulder , but he ignored it . He ignored his side . Suppressing any kind of pain , he surged upright again as smoothly as he couldFacing in the wrong direction . He wheeled back to the Prince 's sprawling body just in time to block Master Gilbur 's dagger.  |p344Roaring  , Gilbur hit Artagel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nearly : not quite . Mustering his balance , his poise , his old skill , Artagel pointed his sword at the base of Master Gilbur 's throat and dared the Imager to move again . The struggle over Prince Kragen apparently held no interest for Master Eremis . He approached Geraden and Terisa and the knot of Masters as if he were on the verge of an epiphany . His smile was so keen it seemed to cut the air . When Geraden cried in frustration , " Does n't anyone have a mirror ? " Eremis began to laugh . He tightened his fingers , murmured something Terisa could n't hear . Instantly , a creature the size and shape of a fruit-bat swept out of the glass , flapped forward , and fastened itself to the nearest Imager'scheek . The man toppled backward , screaming . " Eremis ! " Geraden yelled as if that were the worst obscenity he knew . From under his jerkin , he produced a knife  --  an eating utensil he must have appropriated at breakfast  --  and threw it with all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something right . He had never trained with a knife ; but by chance his blade shattered the glass in Eremis ' hand as neatly as if that was what he had intended all along . Splinters sprayed out of Eremis ' grasp , glittering like jewels in the light . The Master 's laugh turned to a snarl . While he ripped out his sword , the doors of the hall slammed open and twenty guards charged inward . Norge 's reinforcements . The guards were too late to save Geraden or Terisa . Their backs were to the wallscreens : they had no escape from the easy action of Eremis ' blade . He plainly knew what to do with a sword . It seemed to flex like a live thing in his hands . In contrast , Artagel did n't need any help . This was the work he had been born to do . First he slapped the dagger out of Master Gilbur 's fist . Then he began to make small , delicate cuts in the Imager'sthick neck , as if he were marking the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All his movements were taut and precise.  |p345U|p  on the balcony , Gart lost another Apt . Gart himself had n't killed anyone : Lebbick kept him back . Lebbick 's fury appeared almostequal to Gart 's skill . The Apts had accounted for five of the defenders . Surveying the situation , Gart judged that one more pikemanwould die before his last student fell . He prepared himself to dispatch Lebbick , perhaps eviscerate him ; then he glanced downward , saw the arrival of the reinforcements , and changed his mind . Before anyone could grasp his intent , he sprang away from CastellanLebbick and vaulted over the railing . A drop like that could have killed him ; it should have snapped his legs . But he had been jumping from high places ever since he began his training under the previous Monomach : he knew how to do it . When he hit the rug , he collapsed into himself and rolled to absorb the impact . Then , despite the fact that his feet and legs had gone numb as if his spine were broken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got was the thump when Gart landed . He turned just in time to keep the Monomach 's sword out of his ribs . Swiftly , he launched a second parry , a counterstroke . He knew he could n't beat Gart , but in the rush of action , the heady flow of battle , he did n't care . Unfortunately , he never finished his riposte . Gilbur 's quickness was like his strength : prodigious . In an instant , he sprang after Artageland clubbed him to the floor with both fists . Prince Kragen was still unconscious . He could have been killed almost without effort . Now , however , Master Gilbur and the High King 's Monomach had other priorities . The charging guards had already covered half the distance from the doors : Master Eremis ' allies only had a few seconds left . Behind them , Castellan Lebbick came down on the rug with asmashing impact . He had tried Gart 's jump , had landed badly . Painripped a gasp out of him ; it muffled the sound of breaking bones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was fighting for his life . No one had opposed his advance on the Masters , on Terisa and Geraden . The Masters were as useless and cowardly as he had alwaysp346believed them to be ; they would n't be worth the trouble of killing . Even Master Barsonage was n't worth killing . Geraden , on the other handBut at the last moment , Master Eremis had paused . He saw something in Geraden 's eyes  --  an unexpected threat ; some kind of fatal promise . It caused the Master to check his swing . Terisa did n't look dangerous . She did n't even look desirable . She had turned inward with her back against the wall as if she were trying to faint . Eremis raised his sword to fend Geraden away while he grabbed at her . Suddenly , a mountain of flesh slapped against him with such force that he nearly went sprawling . The Tor  --  ! Eremis got his blade up just in time to keep the fat , old lord from splitting his head open . Considering the Tor 's skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a cudgel . Nevertheless it had weight behind it , and a mad , blubbering fury . Master Eremis parried as hard as he could , and again , and again ; yet he was driven backward . He would have to disembowel that old slob to stop him . " My lord ! " Geraden yelled . " Look out ! " The Tor did n't seem to hear the warning . He was still swinging his sword like a club when Gart kicked him in the stomach hard enough to rupture his guts . Retching , he collapsed to his knees and presented his exposed neck to Gart 's blade . Geraden jumped at Eremis . Gilbur intercepted him , however , and flung him aside like a handful of rags . Like Prince Kragen , Geraden was n't important enough to risk death over . Terisa was the one who mattered . Eremis closed a hand around her arm . Gart braced himself for the quick satisfaction of beheading the Tor . Fuming curses and agony , one knee crushed , an ankle cracked , Castellan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was barely able to stand ; every movement ground splinters of bone against each other . His sword hung in his hands , too heavy to lift through the pain . Yet he kept Gart from killing the Tor.  |p347To  save himself , Gart whirled and drove his sword straight through the Castellan 's heart . Lebbick 's eyes flew wide , as if he had just seen an astonishing sight . Blood burst from his mouth , gushed down the front of his mail . He dropped his weapon . For a moment , his hands clutched at Gart 's blade as if he wanted to wrench it out of his chest . Then , like a man who had decided to let go , he released the iron . " Bastard , " he breathed between gouts of blood as if he were talking to someone else , not Gart at all . " Now I 'm free . You ca n't hurt me anymore . " Slowly , as if performing at last the only graceful action of his life , he slid backward off Gart 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife . Full of horror , Terisa tried to break Master Eremis ' grip ; but she could n't do it . She had never been strong enough with him . Geraden lay on the floor without moving . Helplessly , she watched as Eremis made a strange , familiar gesture , a signal she had seen once before . Only a heartbeat ahead of the charging guards , she and Eremis , Gilbur and Gart were translated out of the hall . In the resulting confusion , a long time passed before anyone noticed that King Joyse had also disappeared.  |p351Norge  ordered everyone to stay in the hall ; but he wasalready too late . Most of King Joyse 's counselors hadscattered , fled like their lord . And the Imagers were no better . Even Master Barsonage , who might in a reasonableworld have been expected to set a good example  --  even the mediator of the Congery was gone . Apparently , he had taken Geradenwith him . The only Master left was the man Eremis had killed ; the creature which had actually slain him was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . " Perfect , " Norge muttered generally . This was as close as he ever came to despair . All those Imagers and old men who could hardly hold their water for fear , already loose in Orison ; already spreading panic . They would tell their friends , their wives , their children , their servants ; some of them would tell total strangers . And when the story got out  --  when people heard that King Joyse was gone , and Lebbick was dead , and the " hero of Orison , " Eremis , was in league with Cadwal  --  Norge sighed to think about it . Orison was going to come apart at the joints . The siege was going to succeed after all . Doing what he could , he sent one of the captains to take command of the gates , control the courtyard ; make sure nobody did anything wild . That was the crucial place , the point at which panicp352could spill outward  --  the point at which Alend could be made aware that Orison was in chaos . He ordered two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed guards to locate the counselors and the Masters , so that decisions could be made . For no particular reason except thoroughness , he organized a search for the King . He made sure that Prince Kragen and Artagel were still alive . Then he went to help the Tor get up . The old lord was on his hands and knees , staring at Castellan Lebbick'sface . The Tor was in terrible pain . No , that was n't true : he was going to be in terrible pain ; he knew he was going to be in terrible pain as soon as the shock of Gart 's kick faded a bit . At the moment , however , he was still stunned , protected from agony by surprise and wine . He wanted to raise his head , but the effort was too much for him . He could n't do anything except stare at Lebbick 's ruined and happy face . People looked like that , he thought , when their kings betrayed them . When they let something as simple and fallible as an ordinary human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cords of purpose . When they drank too much  --  And then were lucky enough to die without having to watch everything else come apart around them . It would be better to die . Better to think Gart 's boot had torn something vital inside him and surrender to excruciation in advance . Better to let wine and loss carry him away . The alternativesThe alternatives were distinctly unpleasant . Unfortunately , the expression on Lebbick 's face would n't let him go . Lebbick 's blood would n't let him go . The first twinge of pain rumbled through his guts , and he nearly groaned aloud , Oh , Castellan . Mordant and Orison and you , he betrayed us all , abandoned us all  --  and you fought for him to the end . What did he ever do to deserve such service ? As soon as the Tor asked the question , however , he found that he knew the answer . Despite his tears , he could see it in Lebbick 's twisted face , his wounds and blood . What King Joyse had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something which de/served loyalty and service no matter how fallible and even treacherousthe King himself proved to be . Mordant . A buffer between the constant , bloody warring of Cadwal and Alend . The Congery . An end to the ravages of Imagery when mirrors were used for nothing but power . Pain pushed against the back of the Tor 's throat , and his stomach knotted ; but he clung to the cold stone with his hands and knees , kept his balance . When that captain , what was his name ? Norge , when Norge came to him and tried to help him erect , he managed somehow to knot his fat fist in the captain 's mail and pull him down , so that Norge had to meet him face-to-face . " The King  --  " he gasped . His voice was a sick whisper , lost in the hurt clench of his abdomen . " Gone , my lord Tor . I 've sent men to look for him , but I do n't expect any results . " " Why not ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to be found . " His immunity to distress was remarkable . Peering into the captain'sface , the Tor ' began to remember him better . It was possible that Castellan Lebbick had promoted Norge simply because Norge was the only man under him who never flinched . A man like that was hard to talk to . What did he care about ? What were his convictions , his commitments ? " Help me up . " The Tor made no effort to move . The pain squeezed his voice to a husk . " I will take his place . " The Tor was n't trying to stand , and Norge did n't try to lift him . Instead , the captain asked calmly , " You , my lord ? " " Me . " For all the strength the Tor could muster , he might as well have been whispering deliberately . Maybe Gart really had rupturedsomething vital . " Who else ? I am the King 's oldest friend . Apart from Adept Havelock  --  and you will not offer him the rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the hurt in his bowels was going to be stupendous . Already it seemed to cut off his supply of air . Sweat or tears ran from him as if he were a sodden towel being twisted . There were too many candles glaring in his eyes . Yet he kept his grip on the captain . " And I am the only lord here . KingJoyse suffered me to remainp354when the others rode away . I have acted as his chancellor and advisor . Something must be done about the panic . Power must be assumed by someone who will be believed . Who else would you have ? " Who else is there ? " Norge blinked at this question as if he did n't think it was worth answering . " I have no hereditary claim , no official standing . " The Tor wanted to wail or weep , but he could n't get that much voice past the pain . " But if you support me in this , Castellan Lebbick 's second , a man with the King 's guard behind him  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " If you support me , I will be accepted . " " My lord Tor , " the captain remarked dispassionately , " even if I support you , you 'll scarcely be able to stand . " After a moment , he added , " If I can say so without offense , my lord , you are n't the king I would have c hosen . " " A fat old man sodden with wine and unable to stand . " It was embarrassing to he in tears at a time like this , but the Tor 's hurt had to have some outlet . " I understand . Do you ? " " My lord " Norge 's calm was maddening , really  --  " you need a physician . Let people in better condition worry about Orison . " " Fool , " the lord moaned . " You do not understand . " Pulling on Norge 's mail , heaving against the pain , he got one leg under him ; that enabled him to shift his other hand from the floor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eremis ' fruitbat gnawing on his guts . Nevertheless he panted through his tears and sweat , " Someone must take command . Orison must be led . And I am here . Prince Kragen is here . For the first time , we know our enemies . We must not miss this opportunity . " " Opportunity ? " Norge asked noncommittally . Oh , for the strength to scream ! The Tor 's stomach and throat seemed to be filling up with blood . " An alliance with Alend , " he croaked out . " Against Cadwal . A chance to end this siege and fight . " The captain said nothing ; his reaction was unreadable . " Norge . " Peering through a blur of pain , the lord leaned closer to whisper straight into the captain 's face . " If I can make an alliance with Prince Kragen , will you support me ? " Norge spent an astonishing amount of time lost in thought . He took forever to arrive at a decision . Or maybe he just seemed to take forever.  |p355Then  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as if he had never hesitatedin his life . The Tor groaned thickly  --  relief and anguish . A desire to lie down and hug his belly nearly overwhelmed him . Somehow , however , he forced himself to ask , " How is the Prince ? " Norge glanced away , then answered , " Rousing . " Hoarse with stress , the Tor breathed , " Reports . I need reports . I must know what is happening . " Ponderously , as if Norge were n't carrying most of his weight , the old lord struggled to his feet . For a moment , pain rose like vomit into his mouth . He could n't see , could n't breathe ; if Norge had n't held him , he would have fallen . But that was intolerable . So much weakness was intolerable . If he let himself fail now , Castellan Lebbick would probably get up from the dead and go do his job for him . With a gasp that went through him like a blade , he pulled air into his chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rousing , no question about it . Artagel still sprawled on the floor as if Master Gilbur had broken his neck ; but the Prince was crawling stupidly toward his sword . A guard who did n't know any better and probably hated Alends stepped forward to kick the sword out of Kragen 's reach . " Stop , " coughed the Tor . Norge ordered the guard to stop . Still barely conscious , Prince Kragen got a hand on his sword and at once began climbing to his feet . Each movement helped bring him back to himself ; the weight of his weapon seemed to make him stronger . By degrees , he came upright , planted his legs , clenched both fists on the hilt of his longsword . His eyes lost their glazed dullness and began to smolder with a murderous rage . Instinctively , he sank into a fighter 's crouch . The tip of his blade searched for the nearest enemy . He was going to swing  --  The Tor nearly wept at the thought that Prince Kragen might do something which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't swing . Slowly , he turned toward the doors ; he saw that men blocked his way . " Dastards ! " he spat as he wheeled I , .  --  k . " Who struck me ? " he demanded softly . " Where is KingJoyse ? "  | " My lord Prince . " Trembling , the Tor released one of his hands from Norge , then the other . Alone , he took two tottering steps towardPrince Kragen , as if he were presenting his belly to the Prince 's blade . Fire seemed to run like water out of his guts and down the nerves of his legs ; nevertheless he kept his head up . " Forgive my weakness . I am unwell . " You were struck by Artagel . " He nodded toward Artagel 's supine form . " You see the outcome . " King Joyse is gone . He disappeared shortly after you fell  --  when Gart attacked . " " Gart ? " Prince Kragen 's eyes widened ; his rage receded slightly . His mind was beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The High King 's Monomach was here ? " The Tor nodded , conserving his strength . At once , Prince Kragen scanned the hall , plainly searching for confirmation . He noticed the archers and pikemen dead on the balcony , the slain Apts ; he absorbed the absence of the King 's counselors , the absence of the Masters . He saw Castellan Lebbick stretched out behind the Tor , and his mouth twisted under his moustacheas if he were suddenly sick . " My lord Tor , " he said in a hitter snarl , " where are my companions , Geraden and the lady Terisa ? They also were protected under a flag of truce . " Still whispering because he did n't have any choice , the old lord replied , " cart had allies . Master Eremis . Master Gilbur . " He saw from Prince Kragen 's face that the Prince was n't particularly surprised by the names he mentioned . " They took the lady Terisa , my lord Prince , " Norge put in casually . " As for Geraden , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more accurate to say the mediator carried him off . " Took the lady Terisa . The Tor blinked stupidly . He had n't seen her go , had n't known  --  But he could n't afford to think about that now . He had to deal with Kragen . " So you see , " he said as well as he could , " we have nowhere else to turn for answers . My lord Prince , I think you should tell us the things you came to tell King Joyse . " " Why ? " Prince Kragen 's question cut the air . " Your King accusedme of an atrocity . Although I was protected under a flag of truce , I was struck down before I could defend myself . " He bit into the words to control his passion . " Apparently , it is amazing that 1p357am still alive . Even your King 's audiences are not safe . And now he has disappeared . ' " Why should I say one word to you , my lord Tor ? " The Tor had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has disappeared , my lord Prince . " The damage to his stomach dragged at him . If he were horizontal , it might hurt less . And if he were asleep , it might stop hurting entirely . On the other hand , Orison had been kicked in the gut as well . He was needed . He had to do whatever he was capable of doing . " He is gone . And the Castellan is dead . He died saving my life when Gart was ready to kill me . There is no power left in Orison . " None except Captain Norge , Lebbick 's second . And Master Barsonage , the mediator of the Congery . And me . " Master Barsonage is not present , but I will speak for him . If you deal openly with us , we are prepared to offer you an alliance . Orison 's strength , and the Congery 's , against Cadwal . " That brought Prince Kragen 's fury up short . He stared for a moment ; his mouth hung open . Then , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand you , my lord Tor ? Have you just proclaimed yourself King of Mordant ? Have you murdered Joyse ? Have you and Norge been plotting revolt ? " " Of course not , " the Tor groaned . " I claim only the position of a chancellor . " Really , this was too much . How could he possibly be expected to stand here and argue when he was probably bleeding to death inside ? " If I were a younger man , I would teach you to regret that accusation . " If Lebbick had n't saved his life , he would have given up the whole business and let himself collapse . " The King is only gone , not deposed . Not murdered . In his absence  --  and in his name  --  and with . Captain Norge 's support , " he added , hoping that Norge would n't contradict him , " I will make decisions . " We are prepared to offer you an alliance , " he repeated . " If you will deal openly with us . " Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  betweensuspicion , curiosity , need . And he probably didn'ttrust the wine-soaked old lord in front of him . Who would ? A guardante into the hall and crossed toward Norge , but the Tor ignoredhim . In addition , Artagel began to fumble toward consciousness . The'I'Or ignored that as well . He concentrated on Prince Kragen 's silence . " Come , my lord Prince , " he wheezed . " I am not well . I will not1e on my feet long . You have said that you desire an alliance . Andp358your desire is demonstrably sincere . With the rupture "  --  poor choice of words --  " of Orison 's gates nearly accomplished , you desisted when Terisa and Geraden came into your hands . But you did not keep them and their knowledge for yourself . You brought them here , risking them and your own person for the sake of what you hoped to gain . " The blow which struck you down under a flag of truce was a mistake . Artagel will admit as much . " The Tor saw no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own needs and desires merely to punish us for a mistake ? " My lord Prince , tell us the things you came to say to King Joyse . " Artagel levered himself off the floor , lurched to his feet ; one hand clasped the hack of his neck , trying too late to protect it from Gilhur 's attack . When he saw Prince Kragen facing him , sword poised , he took a step backward and looked around urgently , searchingto comprehend what had happened . " A report , my lord Tor , " Norge announced tranquilly . " You asked for reports . " There 's panic in Orison , and it 's spreading , but we 've been able to keep it out of the courtyard  --  away from the gates . The Prince 's honor guard is waiting as patiently as possible . No sign of KingJoyse . Geraden is definitely with Master Barsonage . The mediator 's quarters . " Two of the duty guards say they saw Adept Havelock 's brown cloud lift off the King 's tower . " Nonchalantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they 're right , it did n't attack the encampment . It just floated out of sight . " The Tor suffered this interruption as well as he could , but he hardly heard what Norge was saying . At the moment , all he really wanted in life was the ability to cry out ; scream his pain at the ceiling . And not just the pain of his brutalized abdomen . He had other hurts as well . Lebbick 's death . King Joyse 's abandonment , when he , the Tor , had staked his heart on the belief that Joyse still deserved trust . And the humiliation of being distrusted because he had drunk too much wine . His eyes ran again . Stupid , stupid . Through the blur , he croaked , " Artagel . " " Is this certain ? " Prince Kragen snapped at Norge . " The report is to be trusted ? The King 's Dastard has not attacked us ? "  | " Lebbick ? " Artagel demanded like a man who still was n't entirelyconscious . " Lebbick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of truce . That was a mistake . Tell him you know it was a mistake . " Both Prince Kragen and Norge stared at the Tor as if the old lord had lost his mind . " Lebbick ! " Artagel cried through a clenched throat . " What have they done to you ? " The Tor tried again . " Artagel . " " Terisa ? Geraden ? " Artagel jerked his head from side to side , scanning the hall , the guards , the bodies . " Where are they ? " A flush of blood and pain filled his face . " Did Gart get them ? Somebody give me a sword ! Where are they ? " " Artagel ! " Norge put an inflection of command into his easy tone . " Eremis and Gart took the lady . Geraden is all right . Pay attention . The Tor gave you an order . " " Gave me a what ? " Artagel rasped as if he were about to begin howling . But then , abruptly , he froze ; his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Where is King Joyse ? " " That , " said Prince Kragen in heavy sarcasm , " is a question we would all like answered . " Slowly , Artagel 's jaw dropped . The Tor made one more effort . " Artagel , you struck Prince Kragen under a flag of truce . I want you to apologize . " Then , deliberately , the old lord closed his eyes and held his breath . He did n't look or breathe again until he heard Artagel say , " My lord Prince , I was wrong . " Artagel was smiling like a whetted axe . His voice held an edge he might have used against Gart . And yetAnd yet he did what the Tor needed . " It 's inexcusable to violate a flag of truce . And you saved my life once  --  you and the Perdon . I just did n't have time to think . I was afraid of what King Joyse might do . Everybody in Orison knows he 's been practicing his swordsmanship . The Castellan said he was probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was crazy enough to try it . " Prince Kragen could n't hide his surprise at this information , but the Tor clung to his pain and let everything else pass over his head.  |p360Unex|pectedly  , his spirits lifted a bit . There was good reason why everybody in Orison liked Artagel . " I 've seen you fight , " Artagel concluded . " King Joyse did n't stand a chance . I was just trying to save him . " Artagel had the Prince 's attention now . Kragen thought intently for a moment , then said , " Artagel , you have the reputation of a fighter . You understand warfare . What is your opinion ? Who has the most to gain from an alliance , Orison or Alend ? " Without hesitation , Artagel answered , " You do , my lord Prince . We 've got the Congery . " The Tor could n't be sure of what he saw any longer . His eyes kept running , and the damage to his stomach seemed to throb up into his head ; his brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the impression that the Prince was sagging , letting go of his fury . " My lord Tor "  --  Prince Kragen 's voice came from somewhere on the other side of a veil of pressure  --  " Geraden and the lady Terisa approached me from the Care of Fayle , where they had witnessed Queen Madin 's abduction . Lim that was by no means their only news . Among a number of other things , they informed me of Master Eremis ' treachery . " Simply for that  --  to warn King Joyse of his enemies  --  I might have been willing to risk myself here . But I have other information as well , knowledge which both confirms and worsens the things Geradenand the lady Terisa revealed . " I know where High King Festten 's army is . " The Tor felt himself about to fall . Really , somebody ought to teach Gart to treat old men with more respect . Nevertheless he was determined to do what he could . " Norge , announce in Orison that I have taken command during the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . It is our only defense against panic . The people must believe that we still stand , regardless of treachery . " Norge saluted equably , but the Tor ignored him . " My lord Prince , " he wheezed as if his wounds were going to kill him , " we must leave this hall before Master Eremis sees fit to attack again . Come with me to King , Joyse 's rooms . We have much to discuss . " I must discuss it sitting down . "  |p361When  Geraden actually recovered consciousness , he wassitting in one of Master Barsonage 's handmade chair . He had opened his eyes before the mediator gothim out of the hall of audiences ; he had forced his legs under him , despite their awkward tendency to flop in all directions , and had carried most of his own weight during the walk from the hall to Master Barsonage 's private quarters ; he had received the news of Terisa 's capture as if he understood it . Nevertheless he had no effective idea of where he was or what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's problems , positioned him in a sturdy armchair , and handed him a flagon of ale . This room was familiar . And almost comfortable , like a restorationof old relationships , old truths . Master Barsonage was the mediator of the Congery . Geraden was an Apt  --  part servant , part student . That made everything simple . He had no worries , no responsibilities , unless the mediator assigned them to him . Unless the mediator explained them to him . Simple . Moving slowly because of the way his head throbbed , he acceptedan automatic swallow from the flagon ; then he drank deeply . And then he remembered so hard that he nearly gasped . Terisa . Eremis had Terisa . " We 've got to help her . "  |p362Perha|ps  he was n't entirely conscious after all . He was n't aware that he had spoken aloud ; he certainly did n't realize that he had dropped his flagon on the floor . He only knew that he was trying to get out of the chair , trying with all his strength , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediator 's bulk was implacable : he could n't shift it . Terisa ! " Let me go . We 've got to help her . " " How ? " demanded the Master bluntly . " How will you help her ? " " The mirror I made . " Geraden wanted to fret like a child , slap at Barsonage 's hands , wail ; somehow , he restrained himself . " The one like Gilhur 's  --  the one I used to bring her here . I can shift it . I made it take me to I ) omnc . " " What will that accomplish ? " The mediator continued to block Geraden 's escape from the chair . " Surely she was not taken to Domne ? " " No . " Geraden found it almost impossible not to yell or weep . " He took her to Esmerel . That 's where he 's been working all this time . I 've seen Esmerel . I can make my mirror show that Image . I can use it to look for her . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let me go ! " No . Forgive me . " Suddenly , the mediator did n't sound firm or implacable . I k sounded grieved , almost wounded . " That will be impossible . " Maybe Master Barsonage had stepped back . Or maybe Geraden felt authority rise in him like fire , giving him strength no one could oppose . He was no Apt , not anymore . Eremis ' enmity had transformedhim . Do n't you understand ? He 's going to rape her . She 's an archImager . He 's going to find some way to rape her talent . Almost without effort , Geraden surged to his feet , pushed the older man back , cleared his own way to the door . Yet the change in the mediator 's tone stopped him ; it had more effect on him than a shout of rage or protest . Now that he could have left , he stayed where he was , caught . " What do you mean ? Why is it impossible ? " " Geraden , forgive me , " Barsonage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In this , I have failed you badly . " Just for an instant , Geraden hung on the verge of an explosion :  |p363he  was going to spit outrage , batter the mediator into talking sense , do something violent . Almost at once , however , he pulled himself back from the edge . " Apologize later , " he said between his teeth . " Just tell me what 's wrong . " " The truth was obvious . " Master Barsonage was n't able to meet his hot gaze . " A child could have seen it . Of course you were able to work wonders with that glass . You brought the lady Terisa among us . You escaped into it , leaving no trace of yourself . We all knew of your talent at last " But I did not think of your talent . I thought only of your guilt  --  or your innocence . And so I missed the obvious implication of the obvious truth . There I failed you . " Geraden beat his fists against his thighs to keep himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not see , " the mediator explained sadly , " that your mirror required special protection , either to keep it from you if you were guilty , or to preserve it for you if you were innocent . " At last , he forced himself to look into Geraden 's face . " Some days ago , a riot took place . It appeared to be an outbreak against the Castellanbutby an astonishing series of coincidences its worst violence occurred in the laborium . During the tumult , several mirrors were shattered . " The only one of importance was yours . " Distinctly , as if the admission were an act of valor , Master Barsonageconcluded , " I have cost you the means to help the lady Terisa . You have no glass with which to search for her . " Geraden found himself staring at nothing . For some reason , the mediator no longer seemed present in the room . Which was nonsense , of course , he was right there , with his chasuble hanging down his vast chest , with his face twisted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way , erased from Geraden 's attention . A riot had taken place . In the laborium . Against Castellan Lebhick . And mirrors had been destroyed . The only whole , perfect mirrorwhich he , Geraden , had ever madeHe would need at least a day to make another glass . Eremis had Terisa . At least a day . A riot against Castellan Lebbick ? " You must understand how confused matters were to us in your absence . " Master Barsonage was speaking earnestly , trying to ex/plain . Maybe he thought an explanation would help . " First you were accused of Nyle 's murder . Then Nyle 's body was mutilated by means of Imagery , and the physician Underwell disappeared . Then Master Quillon was killed . That was clear evidence of the lady Terisa 's guilt  --  evidence which demonstrated your own guilt by association . The Castellan himself witnessed her power , as well as her alliance with Master Gilbur . " No , this was n't working . Geraden did n't need an explanation . Or he did n't need this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he could somehow have focused his attention on the mediator , he would have demanded , A riot against Castellan Lebbick ? " And then , " Barsonage was saying , " the Castellan himself began to insist on your innocence  --  on the lady Terisa 's innocence . Plainly , he had lost his reason . The King 's madness had at last driven Lebbick mad . And yet he insisted , when all Orison except the guard had turned against him . Ile insisted  --  but privately , privately , so that few could hear him  --  upon accusing Master Eremis , who had single-handedlysaved us from an Alend victory by thirst . " What were we to think ? Without doubt , the lady Terisa 's talent  --  andyour own  --  gave us back our purpose . The meaning of the Congery had been restored . But what were we to do ? Had she come to save us , or destroy us ? I lad you in fact murdered your brother , or were you innocent ? Such questions consumed us . We were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covet the power of Imagery do not destroy mirrors . " Geraden had the impression that if he moved  --  if he so much as opened his mouth to breathe  --  he would at once fall into a pit of blackness . It filled the room all around him , lurking behind the illusoryimages of Master Barsonage and the furniture . Everything he had ever done had gone wrong . Was n't that true ? For all practical purposes , he had brought Terisa here simply so that Master Eremis could have her at the peak of his power , at the moment of her greatest vulnerability . What a triumph . The climax of a brilliant life . Everythinghad gone wrong since the day his mother had died , and he had sworn , sworn , that he was never again going to let that happen to anyone he loved . Nevertheless he could n't stop trying . The bare idea of surrenderingto Eremis made him sick . There had to be something he could doA riot against Castellan Lebbick ?  |p365Deliberately  , he opened his mouth . Gritting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , focus his eyes on the mediator . " Why Lebbick ? " That was n't exactly the question he wanted to ask , but it was close enough . " Why did they turn against Lebbick ? " Master Barsonage shrugged his massive shoulders . " The maid Saddith . " This subject was considerably less personal for him . " He beat her  --  beat her nearly to death . She was maimed by it . " She incited the riot to gain revenge . " Suddenly , as if Barsonage had murmured the words and made the gestures to perform a translation , Geraden 's weakness was gone , banished . There was n't any pit of blackness around him : there was only a room he knew fairly well ; a room which on this occasion did n't have enough lamps lit , with the result that the corners were obscure , like hiding places . " Master Barsonage "  --  Geraden was mildly astonished by his own calm  --  " why did he beat her ? That 's where it started  --  the series of coincidences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest obviously took the mediator aback . He hesitated for a moment , as if he thought he ought to steer the discussion in a more useful direction . Whatever he saw in Geraden 's face , however , persuaded him to answer . " The story is that she went to his bed , the night after the lady Terisa 's disappearance . She said that she grieved for him in his distressand wished to comfort him . Those who were willing to doubt her  --  and they were few after the extent of her injuries became known  --  said that she offered herself to him so that he would elevate her above the position of a chambermaid . " Again , Geraden wanted to explode . " And that did n't warn you ? " he snapped . " It did n't make you suspicious at all ? Did n't you remembershe was Eremis ' lover ? I told you that . I told you he 's been using her . Did n't it ever occur to you that he might have sent her to Lebbick ? What have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master Barsonage 's face turned hard ; his eyes glittered . " You are no longer an Apt . No one could deny that you have become an Imager . Yet I remain the mediator of the Congery . I expect your respect . " I have admitted my fault . I did not foresee the danger to yourglass . In other matters , however , I have not earned your anger . " With difficulty , Geraden restrained himself . " I 'm sorry , " he gritted , unable to unclench his jaws . " I did n't mean to offend you . I'mp366just terrified for Terisa . " At once , he went on , " Do you mean you were suspicious of Eremis ? What did you do ? " The mediator studied Geraden for a moment , then apparently decided to let himself be mollified . Shrugging again , he replied , " The relationship between Master Eremis and the maid was of interest to me , naturally . But it was a matter of inference only  --  hardly a demonstration of treachery . And his public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he admitted wryly , " have dismissed my suspicions , inevitable though they were . " However , your brother Artagel came to speak with me  --  " Geraden held himself still , waiting . " After the lady Terisa 's show of talent , " Master Barsonage explained , " the Congery at last went to work with a will , showing the kind of dedication King Joyse has always wanted . Respecting the strictures he had placed upon us from the first , we began to search for tools of defense , ways in which we might preserve Orison , or even Mordant  --  methods to oppose or assist you and the lady Terisa when we learned the truth about you . " Half-smiling , the mediator digressed to say , " Prince Kragen seemed on the verge of breaking Orison 's gates when you distracted him . I can assure you , however , that he would not have been able to enter this castle without my consent . " Then he resumed , " In this work , Master Eremis at first took no part . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reservoir . " Geraden held his breath . " The day after the riot , however , he came to me to announce that he was ready to take up his duties among the Congery . " He could not know that I had had a long conversation with Artagel several days previously . " Artagel informed me that  --  despite his own evidence  --  CastellanLebbick was now convinced of your innocence . He was convinced of Master Eremis ' guilt . And his reasoning was persuasive . From Artagel , it was very persuasive . " Master Barsonage sighed . " Unfortunately , Geraden , there was no proof . There was no basis on which Master Eremis could be accused , no way it could be shown that the man who had saved usfrom Alend had done so for Cadwal 's benefit rather than our own . " Therefore I could not turn against him . I could not so muchas deny him his place in the Congery , for fear that he would be alertedp367to my distrust . And yet I also could not further expose the Congery to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you well  --  but I have served the King better . I concealed the Congery 's true work from Master Eremis . I lied to him about it . I allowed him to see no sign of it , play no part in it . He does not know how well prepared we are to assist in the defense of Orison . " Geraden cleared his lungs slowly . His head was clear , and a number of things seemed to be growing clearer around him . After all , there was really no way Master Barsonage could have predicted that Eremis would use Saddith to start a riot in order to cover up an attack on his , Geraden 's mirror . But to keep the Congery 's work secret  --  to do practical labor on Orison 's behalf without allowing the knowledge to fall into Eremis ' hands  --  That was well done . And Artagel trusted him , trusted Terisa . Even Castellan Lebbick had trusted both of them , despite Master Eremis ' manipulations . There was hope . He did n't know what it was yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell him ? " he asked the mediator softly . " What kind of lie did he believe ? " Unexpectedly , Master Barsonage smiled  --  a grin so sharp it seemed almost bloodthirsty . " I told him that we have dedicated all our resources to discovering how our enemies are able to make use of flat mirrors without going mad . " A muscle twitched in Geraden 's cheek . Yes , that was a lie which would be believed by anyone who was convinced of the Congery 's fundamental ineffectuality . " Was n't that true ? " he asked . The lift of the mediator 's shoulders was like his grin . " There was truth in it . I have asked two of the Masters to concentrate on that question . The rest of us , however , have been laboring for more immediate results . " Geraden felt his courage coming back to him , his hope growing stronger . " Good , " he pronounced . " How did Eremis react ? " " He offered his help . " As he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a more familiar bafflement . " In fact , he proposedthe most plausible theory I have ever heard . He suggested that the translations are done , not with one mirror , but with two . A flat glass is placed in the Image of another mirror , and then bothp368translations are enacted simultaneously , so that the flat mirror functionslike a curved one and therefore does n't exact the usual penalty . " " He told you that ? " Geraden was startled ; his still-fragile selfconfidenceflinched . " Then it must be wrong . " His own theory must be wrong . " It is , " sighed Master Barsonage . " Did you know that translation pulverizes glass ? I did not . Yet it is true . We have attempted Master Eremis ' suggestion three times , and each time the flat mirror was reduced to powder as it passed into the Image of the curved mirror . " " Glass and splinters ! " Geraden groaned . This was too much : he was wrong again ; everything he thought he understood was wrong ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense . He could n't hold his head up , face the older Imager . There was nothing he could do to save Terisa . " This surprises you , " observed the mediator thoughtfully . " Not Master Eremis ' suggestion , but rather its failure surprises you . Geraden , you amaze me . You had already considered this idea for yourself , when no other member of the Congery had so much as imagined it . " Eremis was playing with him , playing with all of them , using them in an elaborate and insidious game they could n't win , a game from which they could n't even escape because they did n't know the rules . Like Prince Kragen in his audience with King Joyse , forced to play hop-board . At the mercy of his opponent . But Master Barsonage was still speaking . " You have disguised yourself for years as Geraden fumblefoot , " he said in a tone of admiration , " and now at last I learn that your talent is prodigious . You are able to do translations which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonish us are familiar to you . " Is there more , Geraden ? Does your talent encompass other wonders as well ? " Geraden hardly heard the mediator . He was thinking , Oh , prodigious . Absolutely . They tremble when I walk into the room . He was thinking , A riot against Castellan Lebbick . Eremis wanted to preserve Orison for Cadwal . And no man could defend the castle better than Lebbick . And yet Eremis had sent his own lover to get beaten nearly to death , simply to generate a grievance against Lebbick , simply to make a riot possible , simply to make it possible for a riot to enter the laborium , so that Geraden'sp369mirror could be destroyed . All that risk for nothing except to dispose of Geraden 's only weapon . Were Eremis and Gilbur and Vagel really that badly afraid of him ? It sounded ridiculous . ButHe took hold of himself , did his best to steady his heart . But they knew his talent better than he did . Why else had theygone to such lengths to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Master Gilbur had guided  --  and studied  --  every moment of hismirror-making . They knew his talent better than he did . They feared it for reasons he did n't yet understand . The same kind of argument had helped move him into action while Houseldon burned  --  and yet he had made no progress toward understanding it . Why had Eremis needed to attack Houseldon ? Or Sternwall , for that matter ? Why was n't the destruction of Geraden 's only mirror enough ? Suddenly  --  so suddenly that he could n't pretend he had been listening to the mediator  --  Geraden said , " Havelock . " Master Barsonage blinked . " Havelock ? " " He 's got all those mirrors . " Geraden was already on his way toward the door . " Come on . " Mirrors which had helped Terisa escape from Gilbur . Mirrors which did n't belong to any Imager except the Adept  --  mirrors Geradencould take chances with . Outside the mediator 's quarters , he began to hurry ; in a moment , he was almost running . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm and slowed him to a fast walk . " What do you hope to accomplish with the Adept 's mirrors ? Will he permit you to touch them ? " A manic laugh burst from Geraden . " Oh , he 'll let me touch them . He is certainly going to let me touch them . " Moving as rapidly as he could with Master Barsonage clasped on his arm , and refusing to answer the mediator 's first question , refusing even to think about it for fear that the possibilities would evaporate if he did , he headed toward the lower levels of Orison , down toward the only entrance he knew of to Adept Havelock 's personal domain . During his one previous visit there , the circumstances had been veryp370different . For one thing , Orison 's extra inhabitants had n't arrived yet ; the depths of the castle had been deserted . And for another , he had n't been paying particularly close attention : most of his mind had been focused on Artagel , suffering from a chestful of corrosive black vapor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the realization that he now did n't know how to get where he was going . Fortunately , Master Barsonage knew . At least some of the Adept 's secrets had been exposed when Castellan Lebbick had followed Master Gilbur and Terisa into the room where Havelock kept his mirrors . As a matter of course , the Castellan 's discovery had eventually been reported to the mediator of the Congery . And Master Barsonage had gone so far as to visit that room full of mirrors himself , in part to see it with his own eyes , in part to make one more painful and ultimately futile effort to communicate with the Adept  --  specifically , to persuade Havelock that the Congery as a whole should be given access to these mirrors . The memory caused Master Barsonage to shudder whenever he thought of it . Adept Havelock had responded with a gracious bow , had taken his hand as if to congratulate him , had kissed each of his fingers like a lover  --  and while Barsonage was distracted by this odd performance , Havelock had urinated on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adept senseless . Although he would never have admitted having them , he enjoyed those dreams . Nevertheless he did n't hesitate to take Geraden to the Adept 's quarters . He and Geraden approached through the storeroom full of empty crates  --  crates , apparently , in which Havelock 's mirrors had been brought to Orison . A door in a niche at the back of the room let them into a short passage . Unexpectedly , Geraden stopped . Pointing at the impressive array of bolts and bars inside the door , he asked , " Does n't he ever lock this place ? Does he let people just walk in whenever they want ? " Master Barsonage sniffed in distaste . " I can not say . I have come here three times . Twice the door was sealed , and he would not open it to me . Perhaps he did not hear me . The third time , the door was open . I found him snoring in his bed . And when I roused him , he was "  --  Barsonage grimaced  --  " unpleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For my own peace of mind , however , I have insisted on guards in the outer hall . Men dressed asp371ordinary merchants and farmers marked us before we entered the storeroom . If you had not been in my company  --  or if you had not been recognized  --  you would have been halted . " Geraden was scowling . " Does Havelock know anything about that ? " " Perhaps . Who can say what the Adept knows ? Perhaps he neitherknows nor cares . " Geraden was thinking about Terisa . Maybe she could have been saved  --  maybe everything would have been different  --  if guards had been placed outside the storeroom earlier . If Adept Havelock had had any idea what he was doing . Snarling to himself , Geraden headed down the passage . Almost immediately , he and Barsonage reached the room where Havelock 's mirrors were kept . It had been dramatically changed . The difference was unmistakable : the room was tidy . Someone had dusted the tables and floor , the mirrors ; swept the broken glass from the stone ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as possible in the relatively constricted space . Someone had set up the small and medium-sized mirrors on the tables and adjusted them so that they caught the light of the few lamps and gleamed like promises . That someone must have been Adept Havelock . Geraden and the mediator spotted him as soon as they entered the room : he was in one corner with a featherduster , crooning over a glass which had been restored to pristine clarity after decades of neglect . He had made the chamber into a shrine . Or a mausoleum . Just for a moment while Geraden and Master Barsonage stared at him , he failed to acknowledge their arrival . Then , however , he wheeled to give them a bow , flourishing his duster as though it were a scepter . His eyes gaped in different directions ; his fat lips leered . " Iarsonage ! " he cackled . " You honor me . What a thrill . Who 's the puppy with you ? " Simply because he could n't resist staring , Geraden noticed a dc tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clean . In fact , it had been scrubbed spotless . Havelock wore it as if he were dressed for a celebration . Master Barsonage kept his distance . " Adept Havelock , " he said with formal distaste , " I am certain that you remember Apt Geraden . He is an Imager now , and has an urgent interest in your mirrors . "  |p372As  if to tease the mediator , Havelock advanced toward him , smiling maliciously . " What , Apt Geraden ' ? " he cried in mock protest . " This boy ? How has that figure of augury and power been reduced to such doggishness ? No , you 're mistaken , it 's impossible . " Swooping suddenly away from Barsonage , he pounced on Geraden . With his hands clapped to Geraden 's cheeks , he shook Geraden'shead from side to side . " Impossible , I tell you . Look , Barsonage . He 's alive . He came back alive . Without her . She risked everything for him , and he came back without her . " Bitterly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Barsonage , you ca n't fool me . Geraden would never have done such a thing . " Geraden seemed to hear the Adept through an abrupt roaring in his ears , a tumult of anger and distress . The suggestion that he might have come hack without Terisa by choice , that he had turned his back on her in some way , was more than he could bear . Harshly , struggling to control his passion , he demanded , " Let me go , Havelock . I need your mirrors . " As if he had been stung , the Adept let out a wail . He dropped his hands , plunged himself to the floor ; before Geraden could react , he kissed the toes of Geraden 's boots . Then he scuttled backward . When he hit the leg of a table , he bounded to his feet . Crouching in the intense stance of a man about to do battle , he commented casually , almost playfully , " If you ever talk to Joyse like that , he 'll cut your heart out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With him it 's hard to tell the difference . " Shocked and disconcerted , Geraden turned a plea for help towardMaster Barsonage . Grimly , the mediator nodded . Swallowing to hold down a bellyfulof uneasiness , he stepped forward , edged his bulk a bit between the Adept and Geraden . Geraden took that opportunity to turn his back on both of them . Deliberately , he placed himself before the first full-length flat mirror he could find . It was an especially elegant piece of work : he noticed its beauty in spite of his concentration on other things , because he loved mirrors . Its rosewood frame was nearly as tall as he was , and the wood had a deep , burnished glow which only long hours of care and polish could produce . The surface of the glass was meticulous , both in itsp373flatness and in its craftsmanship . The glass itself held an evanescent suggestion of pink  --  a color which now appeared to complement the frame , although of course the frame had actually been chosen to suit the glass . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand into a dune with a keen , curled edge , like a breaker frozen in motion ; but there was no wind now . The color of the sky was a dry , dusty blue that he associated almost automatically with Cadwal . In some ways , this landscape was the purest he had ever seen , too clean even for bleached bones . No one and nothing alive had ever set foot on that dune . Only urgency kept him from studying every inch of the mirror , simply to understand the Image  --  and to appreciate the workmanship . He had no idea how Terisa worked with flat glass . And he had no particular reason to believe he could do the same thing . In fact , he hardly knew how he had contrived to translate himself from the laborium to the Closed Fist . He certainly had n't done anything to prove himself an arch-Imager . Nevertheless he did n't hestitate . He came back alive . Without her . Geraden would never have done such a thing . Facing the glass , he closed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Adept Havelock were watching him , and Terisawas lost , and he had never tried anything like this before . Yet he had the strongest feeling  --  He pulled his concentration together , firmly wiped panic and confusion and anguish out of his heart . In the mirror of his mind , he began to construct an Image of lsmerel . Still trying to intervene between Geraden and Havelock , the mediator asked the Adept carefully , " You mentioned King Joyse . Do you know where he is ? " " He has flown , " spat back Havelock , his mouth full of vitriol . " lake a bird , ha-ha . You think he has abandoned you , but it is a lie , a lie , a lie . When everything else is lost , he breaks my heart and gives me nothing . " Geraden ignored both of them . He found it easy to ignore distractions now . Something lumi/nous was taking place . He had no training in Image-building ; no Imager practiced that skill . He was working with an entirely new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen ; that translations could be done which ignored the apparent Image of a mirror . As new to the world as Terisa herself . And yet the process of creating the Image he wanted in his mind excited him ; it enabled him to close his attention to anything which interfered . Line by line , feature by feature , he put together a picture of Eremis ' " ancestral Seat . " He had only seen it once , of course  --  and only from the outside . He had no notion what it looked like inside . But that did n't worry him . He believed that the scenes and landscapes in mirrors were real , that Images were reflections rather than inventions . So if he could induce the glass to show Esmerel from the outside , the manor 's true interior would be included automatically . " What do you mean , " asked Master Barsonage , " flown ' ? " He did n't seem to expect an answer , however . He may not have been listening to himself at all . Esmerel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a brook bubbling picturesquely over its stones and outcroppingsof rock like ramparts all along the walls  --  not low because of any lack of sweep or grace in its design , but because it was constructed on only one rambling , aboveground level . According to rumor , some of the best features of the house were belowground , dug down into the rock of the valley : an enviable wine cellar ; a gallery for weavings , paintings , and small sculptures ; a vast library ; several research halls . But naturally Geraden knew nothing about those things . He knew , however , that a portico defined the entrance  --  a portico with massive redwood pillars for columns . The entrance , as he remembered it , was plain , only one lamp in a leaded glass frame on either side , no carving on the panels of the doors . The house 's walls were layered planks  --  waxed rather than painted against Tor 's weather  --  but all the corners and intersections were stone , with the result that Esmerel 's face had a pleasingly varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  or unless his memory or his imagination had gone wrong  --  Master Eremis ' home looked precisely like that . Master Barsonage let out a stifled gasp . His respiration was labored , as if he had stuffed his fist into his mouth and was trying to breathe around it.  |p375To  commemorate the occasion , Adept Havelock began whistlingthinly through his teeth . Geraden opened his eyes . The mirror in front of him showed a sand dune under a calm sky , almost certainly somewhere in Cadwal . The pang of his disappointment was so acute that he nearly groaned aloud . " I would not have believed it , " whispered Barsonage . " When I was first told that such things could happen , I did not believe it . " " Are you out of your mind ? " inquired the Adept politely . " That 's how I know this is n't Apt Geraden . Even if he did talk to me that way . A man who can do this would n't have to come back without her . " Geraden blinked hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going blind . The Image he was staring at had n't changed at all . Distressed and baffled , he turned toward Master Barsonage -- and saw Esmerel , as clear as sunlight , exactly as he had envisionedit , in the curved mirror standing beside the flat glass he had chosen to work with . " By the pure sand of dreams , " he murmured , " that 's incredible . " A curved mirror , a curved mirror . Excitement leaped up in him ; he could hardly restrain a yell . " I would n't have believed it myself . " A curved mirror , of course ! Flat glass was Terisa 's talent , not his . If he had tried to translate himself through a flat glass , he would have gone mad . Like Havelock . " Do n't flatter yourself , " Havelock advised sententiously . " If you think I 'm going to kiss your boots again , just because you can do a little trick like that , you 're full of shit . " But curved glass  --  ! Like the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mirror which had reached Terisa behind the Image of the champion . He could shift the Images in curved mirrors . Quickly , before he had time to be overwhelmed by his discovery , he approached the glass and began to adjust the focus . " Now I 'll find her . " The pressure of hope and need cramped his lungs . " I 'll get her away from you , you bastard . If I find you , I 'll even get you . Just try to stop me . Just try . " Fighting the tremors in his hands , the long shivers which made his fingers twitch , he tipped the mirror 's frame to bring the Image of Esmerel closer.  |p376Distance  was the problem , distance . He knew that  --  and tried to keep it out of his mind , tried not to let it terrify him . If the focus of the Image was too far from the place where Terisa was being held , he would n't be able to adjust the mirror enough to reach her . Every glass had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a certain distance from its natural Image . If he could n't reach Terisa , he would have to start over again from the beginning : based on what he learned now , he would have to build the Image of Esmerel again , re-create it in his mind  --  but closer this time , closer . In his present turmoil , that kind of concentration might be impossible . No , do n't fail , he exhorted the glass , do n't fail now , you 've never done anything right in your life except love her , she 's all there is for you and Orison and Mordant and even Alend , do n't fail now . With a jerk because his hand was unsteady , the Image moved to a near view of the entrance under the portico . Another jerk . The Image moved into the forehall of the manor . Geraden stopped breathing . Like the exterior walls , the floor was formed of fitted planks anchored with stone . Years of use and wax made the boards gleam , but could n't conceal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did had been there in nailed boots  --  had been there recently . Mud , footprints , gouged spots , splinters : they were all distinct in the Image . Nevertheless the forehall was empty . Sweat streamed into Geraden 's eyes . He scrubbed at it with the back of his hand . Dimly , he was aware that both Master Barsonage and Adept Havelock were standing over him , watching his search ; but he had no attention to spare for them . More smoothly , he moved the Image into the first room which opened off the forehall . A large sitting room : the kind of room in which formal guests sipped sweet wines before dinner . Tracked with mud and bootmarks . Bloodstains . Deserted . " Why is no one there ? " asked the mediator softly . " Where is Master Eremis ? Where are his mirrors  --  his power ? " Geraden 's heart constricted . Nausea rose in his throat as he moved the Image through the house.  |p377A  cavernous dining room . More mud and bootmarks , more bloodstains . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , Terisa , please , where are you ? Geraden scanned two more fouled rooms , both empty , then located a wide staircase sweeping downward . " The cellars , " mumured Master Barsonage . " That is where they would imprison her . " Of course . The cellars . Esmerel 's equivalent of a dungeon . Eremiswould n't keep his mirrors or his apparatus or any of his secrets where passersby or even tradesmen might catch sight of them . Everythingwould be belowground . Who was responsible for all this mud , all these bootmarks ? Geraden nudged the Image downward . For the first few steps , he was so absorbed in what he was doing  --  so caught up in the focus of the glass , the search for Terisa , the need to succeed  --  that he did n't understand what was about to happen to him , did n't realize the truth at all , even though it was perfectly plain in front of him , so obvious that any farmer or stonemason , any ordinary man or woman , would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dim , began to grow palpably dim in the glass , and Master Barsonage croaked , " Light . " Light . Geraden 's hands froze on the frame . His whole body lost movement , as if the breath and blood had been swept out of him . The stairs loomed below him darkly , treads descending into an immeasurableblack . There was no light . No lamps or lanterns or torches or candles . They had been extinguished . The Image still existed , of course ; but without light there was nothing to see . He had no answer to that defense . By that one stroke , any attempt to rescue Terisa was instantly and effectively prevented . He could n't help her if he could n't find her  --  and how could he find her it he could n't see her ? " Maybe  --  " The air seemed to thicken in his lungs ; he felt like he was suffocating . " Maybe there 's light farther down . Maybe only the stairs are dark . " At once , Master Barsonage clamped a warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the former Apt were far away , lost in urgency , almost out of reach , " how will you find it ? If there is light , how will you find it ? You can not focus an Image you can not see . You may shift it into the foundations of the house , where no light will ever reach . " " I 've got to try . " Geraden was choking . The mediator 's hand on his shoulder was choking him . " Do n't you understand ? I 've got to find her . " " No ! " Master Barsonage insisted . Geraden 's passion appeared to affect him like anguish . " You can not focus an Image you can not see . " That was true . Of course . Any idiot could have told him that . Even a failed Apt who had never done anything right in his life could recognize the truth . Darkness made all the mirrors blind  --  and all Imagers . Somehow , Geraden stepped back against the pressure of Barsonage'sgrip . Facing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said harshly , " Then I 'll have to go myself . " With a look of iron on his face , and no hope in his heart , he made the mental adjustment of translation and stepped into the glass . As his face crossed into the Image , he cried out , " Terisa ! " Master Barsonage wrenched him back so hard that he sprawled among the tables . Before he could regain his feet  --  or curse or fight  --  Adept Havelocksat down on his chest , straddling his neck . " Listen to me , " the Adept snarled , savage with strain . " I ca n't do this for long . " His eyes rolled as if he were going into a seizure . " You can make us let you go . Just use that voice . We 'll obey . But we wo n't be able to get you back . " Geraden bucked against the Adept , tried to pitch Havelock off him . Havelock braced his legs on either side , clutched at Geraden 's jerkin with both hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Your power sustains the shift ! When you translate yourself , that glass will revert to its natural Image . You 'll be cut off !  --  you and the lady Terisa both ! You 'll both be lost ! " It was too much . Geraden flung Adept Havelock aside . He surged to his feet . With all his strength , he punched Master Barsonagein the chest  --  a blow which nearly made the massive Imager take a step backward . Then he faced the mirror and began to howl . " Eremis ! Do n't touch her ! "  |p379Eremis  was touching her . He was certainly touching her . She had never been strong enough against him . Her concentration had never been strong enough . . A'aal While he had approached her in the audience hall , while he had threatened Geraden , while he had fought with the Tor , she had attempted something she did n't know how to do , something she had never heard of before : wild with anger and desperation , she had tried to reach out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On some level , she knew that was impossible . She was on the wrong side of the glass , the side of the Image , not the side of the Imager . But the knowledge meant nothing to her . If she could feel . - t rat : , 1ation taking place , surely that gave her a link , a channel ? And she did n't have any other way to fight . Her need was that : xtreme : the did n't care that what she was trying was probably insane . Her strange and unmeasured talent was her only weapon . If she could fade , if she could go far enough away to reach his mirrorHis hands made that impossible . They forced her to the surface of herself when she most needed to sink away . First there was his grip on her arm . He flung her toward the translation point as if it were a wall against which he intended to break her bones . But he did n't let her go.  |p380Then  there was the bottomless instant of translation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of light . It was orange and hot , part furnace , part torches  --  and full of smoke , rankly scented . Another man was there , someone she had n't seen before , a blur as Eremis impelled her past him , kept her spinning . Gilbur and Gart were right behind her , as blurred as everything else . And Eremis was shouting , " The lights ! Put out the lights ! " Before she could get her eyes into focus , see anything clearly , the torches dove into buckets of sand ; a clang closed the door of thefurnace . Darkness slammed against her like a wave of heat . " What went wrong ? " someone demanded in a rattling voice . " Geraden , " snapped Master Eremis . " He remains alive . Wemust not let him see this place . " " I tried to kill him , " Gilbur snarled . " I hit him hard . But that puppy is stronger than he appears . " " She must not see it , " continued Eremis . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them ? Perhaps they are able to share Images in their minds . " The first voice , the man she did n't know , made an assenting noise . " Then it is good that we were prepared for this eventuality . If we were in the Image-room  --  " A moment later , he added , " It would be interesting to learn what he does when he regains consciousness . " " As long as he can not find us , " muttered Master Gilbur . " In the dark ? " Master Eremis laughed . " Have no fear of that . " He sounded exultant , almost happy . His grip on Terisa shifted ; with one hand , he held both her arms behind her back . " She is mine now  --  and they are ours . No matter that Geraden still lives , and Kragen . That will only add spice to the sauce . They will do exactly what we wish . " " And Joyse ? " asked the rattling voice . " You saw , " rasped Gilbur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cowering in some hidey-hole , hoping for mad Havelock to save him . " The tone of Eremis ' laughter suggested that he doubted Gilbur 's assessment . He did n't argue , however . Instead , he said , " It will be safe to renew the lights when the door is closed . " Firmly , irresistibly , he pushed Terisa ahead of him into the dark.  |p381And  all the time , she was still trying to concentrate , still trying to fade . Now , of course , she was n't reaching toward the glass Eremis had used ; she was struggling to find Adept Havelock 's supply of mirrors , striving to feel the potential for translation across the distance . She could sense translations as they occurred . She was sensitive to the opening of the gap between places . That must mean something . There must be some way she could use it . But Eremis ' grasp made everything impossible . He held her too roughly , so that her arms hurt ; he pushed her too far ahead of him into the blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through another door : the visceral fear of running into something kept her from being able to pull her heart and mind away . The way he chuckled between his teeth filled her with rage and despair . I 'm not yours . Never . I 'll find some way to kill you . No matter what happens . I swear it . It was impossible to fade while she was so full of fury . And then the way he held her changed . Through the second doorway and across a rough floor , he suddenlythrust her down . She could n't catch herself because he did n't free her arms : she landed heavily on a pillow , a bed . Deftly , he turned her so that she lay on her back , with her wrists now clamped above her head by one of his hands . Then he clasped something iron around her left wrist ; she heard a click , a faint rattle of chain . In spite of the fetter , however , he continued to hold her arms pinned . He went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft , leather shirt , exposing her breasts , her vulnerable belly . " I must chain you , " he murmured pleasantly , " a small precaution against your strange talents  --  and Geraden 's . But it will not prevent me from satisfying my claim on you . You will find that I am not easily satisfied . On the other hand , we have plenty of time . " If you are compliant , I will keep you bound as little as possible . " In the dark , she struggled ; she wanted to smash his face , wanted io feel his blood on her hands . He pinned her easily , however ; he knew how to keep women from getting away from him . When she paused to gather her strength so that she would n't weep , he curled his tongue like a lick of wet fire around each of her nipples , and his hand slipped aside the sash of her trousers.  |p382Gas|ping  on the verge of tears , she tried to twist out of his hold ; failed . Abruptly , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles . She was n't accomplishing anything ; she was just contributingto her own defeat by making herself wild . She could n't concentrate  --  Let him think her stillness was a form of surrender . If he was that arrogant . " You will accept my manhood completely , " he murmured . " I will take possession of you in all ways . And I will not be satisfied until you beg me to enter you wherever and whenever I desire . " His mouth clung to her nipples , teasing them involuntarily erect , caressing and probing them . At the same time , his hand moved down into her open trousers to the place between her legs which only Geraden knew . His fingers stroked her there as if he believed that she was being seduced . Far away in her mind , she was imagining his death . When he began to pull her trousers off her hips , however , she returned to defend herself . Her eyes were starting to adjust  --  and this room was n't absolutely lightless . Hints of illumination filtered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed window in the wall above her . Eremis ' head was a shape of deeper blackness poised to make her breasts ache . She could n't fight him physically . But she could still fight . Taking advantage of the fact that he had left her mouth free , she said , " Gilbur thinks King Joyse is a coward , but you do n't agree . " Her tone should have warned him : it was n't unsteady enough , frightenedenough , to indicate surrender . " Why is that ? " " Because , my sweet lady "  --  he was too full of victory to refuse to answer her  --  " you betrayed him to me . " She could feel him grinning over her in the dark . " I might have believed that he was a fool , or a coward , or a madman . But you came to me while Lebbick had me in his dungeon , and you opened my eyes . At a time when I might have remained innocent of the knowledge , you showed me that King Joyse understoodhis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Terisa 's spirit squirmed at the thought ; but she kept her body passive . " This revelation enabled me to adjust my plans to accommodate the possibility that he may have been setting traps of his own . If I had been forced to wait until Quillon finally exposed himself andp383Joyse by rescuing you , I might have found myself in difficulty . But you "  --  Eremis entered her maliciously with his fingers , making her flinch  --  " gave me time to prepare a more personal snare  --  time to arrange for Queen Madin 's abduction , to cut the ground out from under Joyse at precisely the moment when I might be most exposed to counterattack . " You made that possible , my lady . " His head was turned toward her now , momentarily sparing her breasts . He was gloating , hardly able to contain his triumph . At that moment , he might have been willing to tell her anything . " You allowed me to perfect my plans against an opponent who may have proved worthier than he appeared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick . It was true : she had given King Joyse to his enemies . " You deserve Saddith 's fate for attempting to thwart me . But because I am grateful I will use only as much force as you require . " He laughed again  --  a snort of pleasure and contempt . Her senses were full of him . He smelled of sweat and confidence . " Gart wished to kill you when you left Vale House , but I did not allow it . Doubtless your death and Geraden 's would have been to our benefit . But then who would have taken the news of the Queen to King Joyse ? How else could I arrange to master both you and Joyse at the same time , except by letting you live ? " You have served me perfectly , despite your opposition . " His fingers continued to work between her legs . " My only regret is that I do not yet have Geraden in my power . That will come , however . I have said that I must think of something truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enmity , and I will do it . " If you are compliant , my lady , you will live a life which many women would envy . But him "  --  Eremis ' fingers hurt her , nearly made her gasp  --  " him I will destroy . " " I doubt it , " she said , breathing hard to diffuse the pain . She was going to kill him . All she had to do was stay alive long enough . " Ile can do translations you do n't understand . Translations you did n't even know were possible until he brought me to Orison . " For a moment , Eremis ' laugh sounded more like a snarl . " That is true . And it offends me . But again I have been abundantly forewarned . The Congery 's augury made me suspicious of Geraden . And ( , ilhur learned much while teaching him to shape his mirror . That allowed me to set in motion all the dangers and distractions whichp384prevented both him and you from exploring your talents , learning what they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he was held by the Masters , so that the Congery did not try to help you . " In that way , we gained a great deal of necessary time . " And now , of course , he is helpless . You can not threaten me with his power . He can translate nothing he can not see . " " I know that , " Terisa replied harshly  --  too harshly . She had n't intended to let so much of her fury show . " But you ca n't see , either . You need light sometime  --  unless you 're planning to give up on Orison and Mordant and Alend , and spend the rest of your life just raping me . " She felt him grin over her . " And when you go out into the light "  --  she did her best to lodge each word like a knife in his vitals  --  " you 'll find that he knows too much about you . He knows how you use flat mirrors without going mad . " Eremis ' reaction was stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hissed between his teeth ; his hand raked across her belly as if to hurt her breasts or strike her face . " How is that , my lady ? " Lying still , expressing defiance with her voice alone , she said , " You put the flat glass inside a curved one and work both translations at the same time . " As quickly as she had gained it , she lost her advantage . The Master relaxed tangibly ; his fingers stroked her nipples while the tension ran out of him . " That is quite accurate , " he commented . " And I must say that I am impressed by Geraden 's ability to reason his way so near the truth . By now , however , Barsonage has discovered that the technique you describe is impossible . Glass translated through glass only shatters . " The true secret , my lady , lies in the oxidate which prepares the curved mirror . That is my discovery , the result of my sweat and study . I learned how to make a mirror into which other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her determination to kill him was all that kept her from despair . There simply was n't room in her for so much anger and the horror of seeing her last hope collapse . " Most of my fellow Masters , " Eremis continued , " would laugh themselves sick if they knew how I have spent my years as an Imager . And yet on my small discovery the world hinges . When I am done ,  |p385all  Mordant and Alend and Cadwal will be at my service , and even High King Festten will acknowledge me supreme . " The prospect filled him with passion . He began kissing Terisa again , and this time she could feel his hunger in the way his mouth nipped and sucked her nipples , the way his tongue thrust against them . His free hand was back inside her trousers , pulling them down , making her ready for him . If he had let her arms go  --  just for a second  --  she would have done her best to put his eyes out . In spite of his triumph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her under control . She had no way to make him stop . She did n't need to make him stop . Out of the dark , the unfamiliar , rattling voice said sourly , " Festten wants you . " Nearly choking with anger , Master Eremis sprang to his feet and wheeled away from Terisa . " Am I to be interrupted with her forever ? She is mine , I tell you , and I have earned her . Festten does not command me ! " The other voice conveyed a shrug . " He has twenty thousand men who believe otherwise . And he desires a report . " Her arms were free . She pulled them down , swung her legs off the bed , sat up ; she tested the chain . It was n't long enough to let her reach Eremis . The cold cuff on her wrist held . " Report to him yourself , " Eremis countered . " Send Gilbur to report . Send Gart . I do not come and go to suit the High King . " " Eremis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The High King trusts me . He has always trusted me . But he does not trust you . He accepts your leadership  --  he does as you wish  --  only because you obtain results which please him . You bring him nearer to victory than he has ever been . " But now you have risked a foray into the heart of Orison itself , and have accomplished nothing except Lebbick 's death and her capture . High King Festten considers that so far all his actions under your guidance have come to nothing . His only satisfaction has been the annihilation of the Perdon . " He desires a report . " " That sheepfucker , " growled Eremis in disgust . " A man who has lost his interest in women  --  a man who can only find pleasure in animals  --  is not fit for kingship . " Nevertheless his tone expressed acquiescence . Despite hisp386anger and frustration , the Master left Terisa alone . Muttering obscenitiesto himself , he strode away through the dark . Because she was n't done  --  because she had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she demanded after him sharply , " Why are you doing this ? " He must have paused . His tone was at once hard and light ; malign ; jubilant . " Because I can . " Almost at once , she was sure that he was gone . For what felt like a long moment , she did n't move . She had given King Joyse to his enemies . Queen Madin 's abduction was her fault . She had gone to Eremis in the dungeon and told him what he needed to know and let him command her to betray Geraden and how could she have been so stupid ? And Geraden did n't know the secret of the oxidate . He could n't fight the Master . He could n't find her in the dark . Hope was out of the question , really . Never mind that . She probably did n't have room for hope anyway . Her yearning for Eremis ' blood was too big : it squeezed out everything else . It made the kind of concentration she needed impossible . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chain left her room to move around the bed . Grimly , she pulled up her trousers , tied the sash tightly , and began to rebutton her shirt . " Unfortunate , " the rattling voice muttered . She froze . How many people were watching her  --  people she could n't see ? " I see well without light . Darkness conceals no secrets from me . But opportunities to witness such nakedness have been rare in recent years . " The speaker 's voice sounded like pebbles on glass . " A woman with such proud breasts , and yet so full of fear . A tantalizing combination . And there is time . Eremis will be away for some little while . Festten will question him narrowly before allowing him to go ahead with his plans . " Terisa wanted to finish buttoning her shirt , but she could n't make her fingers work . How many people  --  ? Until now , she had only been afraid of Eremis , not of the dark itself , not of the place where he had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like used meat . And I do notp387like any meat enough to risk my alliance with him . Hide your breasts  --  or flaunt them  --  as you choose . " She heard relish as well as scorn in the rattle . " They will not sway me . " As if she had been waiting for his permission , she fumbled at the fastenings of the shirt . At last , her eyes were adjusting to the dark . When she peered hard , she was able to discern the outlines of a figure near where she guessed the doorway to be . The voice came from that direction . Clenching her teeth for courage , she stood up and tested the chain . She was able to swing her arms before she came to its limit . Following it to its anchor , she found that it was stapled into the wall at the head of the bed  --  nearly ten feet of it , enough to let her perform almost any conceivable gymnastic feat on the bed , but not enough to let her evade the dim figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much range of motion . If everything else failed , she would at least have a chance to hit Master Eremis before he touched her again . Deliberately , she wrapped some of the chain around her fist to give it weight . She placed her back against the wall . Then she faced the figure with the rattling voice . " You 're Vagel . " She did n't need confirmation : she was sure . " The famous arch-Imager . The man who drove Havelock mad . Why do you do it ? " " Do what ? " " Put up with him . You call it an alliance , but he probably treats you like a servant . You 're the arch-Imager . The most powerful man anybody has ever heard of . Why are you serving him ? Why is n't it the other way around ? " The outlines of the figure suggested a shrug . " Power , " he said like stones scattering against a mirror , " is more often a matter of position than of talent . He told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hinges on the little discovery which enables him to translate glass through glass . But that is not his real power . " " Really ? " She could n't stifle her impulse to goad Vagel . She was too frightened and furious for any other approach . Apparently , Vagel had been listening  --  watching  --  while Eremis had her naked . " What is ? " " His real power , " rattled the arch-Imager , " is that he is irreplaceableto all his allies  --  because of his talents , of course , but alsop388because of his position , in the Congery , in Orison . What access do I have to his resources , his freedoms ? Gilbur , I grant you , has also been favorably placed . But there it is his talent which is replaceable . He is only swift  --  uncommonly swift  --  rather than brilliant . And he hates everyone too much to form bonds  --  everyone except Eremis . " No , Eremis ' real power is that he can have his way with anyone . " He has his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and although I am the link which allowed him to begin his dealings with Festten , years ago when he rescued me from renegade destitution among the Alend Lieges . He will have his way with Festten , despite the High King 's taste for absolute authority . He will have his way with you "  --  Vagel let out a malign chuckle  --  " until the only thing which prevents you from begging for death is that he does not let you speak . " He will even have his way with King Joyse in the end . " Now Vagel 's tone suggested hard things  --  broken things with sharp edges . " For that reason I do not care how utterly I serve him . " Unexpectedly , Terisa had stopped listening . The Alend Lieges . The way he said those words triggered a small leap of intuition , fitted on odd , minor detail into place . In surprise , she said , " Carrier pigeons . " Vagel was silent , as if she had startled him . " You 're the one who brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieges . " " Those mucky barons , " growled the arch-Imager . " Their squalorand their petty ambitions nearly drove me mad . They demanded  --  demanded  --  Power . Imagery . I had to satisfy them to keep myself alive , me , the greatest Imager they had ever known . And yet they were satisfied with birds that could carry messages . I would have destroyed them long ago  --  I would have required that of Eremis  --  if they were n't such little men . " For that also , for the humiliation they cost me , Joyse will suffer . " " Revenge , " Terisa muttered . Her attention shifted back to Vagel . " He and Havelock beat you back when you thought you were about to become the master of the-world , and you ca n't live with it . Now you do n't care who has the power . You do n't care how much Eremis humiliates you . All you care about is hurting the people who showed you you were wrong about yourself.  | " What Eremis is doing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Is it ? " Vagel 's voice purred like a fall of small stones . " How strangely you think . Your defeat becomes less and less surprising , despite all the nearly unguessable implications of your talent . " Eremis ' manner is demeaning , but the rewards he offers are not . Do you believe that either Joyse or Havelock proved themselves better men than I am  --  more able or deserving , more powerful ? No . They only proved that they were more treacherous . And you have seen in the decline of Mordant and the collapse of Orison that there exists nothing so desirable , worthy , or powerful that it can not be betrayed . I was beaten , not by a good Imager or a good king , but by a good spy . " She expected the arch-Imager to advance , but he did n't . " Do not despise revenge . Unless I am much mistaken "  --  he was sneering at her  --  " you yourself have no other passion . " In your case , however , revenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make glass from the blood-soaked sand of your desires . Eremis will have his way with you , and then the truth of you will be proven absolutely . " " It 's the same for you , " she retorted , fighting back so that what he said would n't crush her . " He 's using you  --  having his way with you . And when he 's done , he 'll just discard you . You wo n't get your revenge after all . He wants all the fun for himself . " Vagel made a sharp , hissing noise . After that , there was a long silence . Terisa tightened her grip on the chain , although the vague figure had n't moved . " No , " he said at last , as if she had provoked him to candor . " All his allies must fear the same thing  --  but he will not discard me . Festten trusts me . Eremis ' plotting would have come to nothing , if I had not stood with him before the High King . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " And without me all the force of Imagery at his disposal will become a blunt instrument  --  able to strike hard , but unable to strike at will . Useless . I am the arch-Imager , as you have observed . The procedures by which we shape mirrors that show the Images we desire are mine . Did you believe that our successes could have been . trhieved randomly ? That Gilbur for all his speed could have made the glass we need simply by mixing accidental combinations of tinct and oxidate , sand and surface ? I tell you , he could have sweated untilp390his heart burst without ever producing a mirror which gave us access to Vale House  --  or one which showed the audience hall of Orison . That victory is mine . " Alone , I have overturned the tenets of Imagery , and no one on Joyse 's foolish Congery can compare with me . " Vagel 's voice intensified . " Eremis can not do without me . His need for glass which only I can provide will never end . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impulse to shout  --  " before I am done I will roast Joyse 's guts over a slow fire . I will hear him howl until his mind goes , or by the stars ! I will take my satisfaction from Eremis himself . " A visceral tremor started up in Terisa 's guts , so hard that she could n't speak . Abruptly , the arch-Imager turned to leave . " Remember that , " he snapped while his voice faded . " Perhaps it will inspire you to surrender to him prematurely , and then his pleasure in you will be made that much less . " He left her with the chain wrapped around her fist and no one to strike . She did n't trust his departure . Her senses strained into the dark , searching for evidence that she was n't alone . But she heard nothing , felt nothing . As for sight  --  She could discern a hint of the doorway , but the corners of the room were as obscure as pits . When she turned her eyes to the wall behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the source of the scant illumination . Her first guess had been right : the light came from a window not quite perfectly sealed . Dropping the chain to increase her range of motion , she climbed onto the bed and reached for the window . From that position , she could get her hands on the boards nailed over the frame . Unfortunately , her fingers found no purchase , either at the edges or in the cracks . She tried until her fingertips tore and her self-control threatened to crumble ; then , so that she would n't start sobbing , she got down from the bed . Calm . It was essential to remain calm . To preserve a semblance of calm until it became the real thing . So that she could concentrate although of course it was impossible to translate herself out of here with a chain on her wrist no , do n't think about things like that , do not . Be calm . Concentrate . Fade.  |p391Pressing  her hands over her face , she sat on the edge of the bed and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too angry and scared , deprived of hope . She had the shakes so badly that her heart itself quivered . She had betrayed King Joyse , and Vagel was going to make him howl  --  Geraden had no way to find her , rescue her . Too many people might still be watching her , concealed behind spyholes , hidden in the cornersEremis would come back as soon as he finished with High King Festten . She needed time to pull herself together . Searching for calm , she decided to explore the room as far as the chain allowed . What else could she do ? Maybe if she failed to find anything she would recover some self-possession . Shaking badly , and too angry to care whether she looked foolish to a spectator , she moved to the staple holding her chain and from there started to grope her way toward the corner , searching the cold , crude stone with her fingers . When her hand touched iron in the wall , she nearly flinched . Iron : another staple . A short chain fixed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetter . That did make her flinch . She recoiled to the bed , sat down facing the dark . Her breath came in hard gasps . She had felt a wrist . Skin . A hand that flexed away from her touch . Another prisoner . Someone was chained in the corner . Eremis had intended to rape her before witnesses . Who are you ? she panted . For a moment , the words refused to come out of her throat . Almost gagging , she forced them . " Who are you ? " No answer . Maybe because she was breathing so hard herself , she could n't hear any sigh or rustle of life . " Are you hurt ? " That was another possibility . Who could tell what Eremis or Vagel or Gilbur  --  or Gart  --  might do to their enemies ? If she had n't felt skin and movement , she would have been tempted to imagine a skeleton . Or a corpse . " Can you hear me ? " She got off the bed and started along the wall again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with caution . " Arc you all right ? "  |p392She  found the staple , the short chain . The hand in the manacle tried to avoid her touch . Nevertheless she shifted from the fettered wrist to an arm . It was draped with loose cloth  --  the sleeve of a cloak ? The fabric was rough and warm ; worsted , perhaps . She found a covered shoulder , a bare neck . The shoulder and neck twisted hard , but they could n't get away ; the other arm must be chained as well . Curse this dark . The prisoner was only a little taller than she was . Although she was near the limit of her own chain , she had no difficulty touching an unshaven face that strained away from her ; terrified of her . " Are you hurt ? " she whispered . " Who are you ? " Roughly , he wrenched his head up and sucked a strangled breath through his teeth . " All right . You 've found me . They told me not to make a sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is n't my fault . " His voice was familiar to her . His bitterness was familiar . Nyle . Geraden 's " murdered " brother . For a moment , she was so glad to find him alive that she could hardly stand . So it was Underwell who had been killed , disfigured ; Eremis ' plotting was just as vile as she had believed it must be . And Nyle was here ; had been kept prisoner for how long now ?  --  held in case he were ever needed again against his brother . " Oh , Nyle , " she whispered in relief and quick nausea , " I 'm so sorry . What have they done to you ? " " Same thing they 're going to do to you . " His bitterness was worse than anger ; he had gone too far beyond hope . " A kind of rape . I 'm just lucky Eremis still wants me alive . Gilbur likes what they call male meat , ' but he has a tendency to kill his toys , so Eremis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They need me to make sure Geraden does n't do something unpredictable . Or King Joyse either , for that matter . " Oh , Nyle . She could n't stay on her feet . Nausea crowded all the relief out of her . Without thinking , she retreated to the bed , sat down again . For some reason , she was n't trembling anymore . But she was going to be so sick  --  If she let go , she was going to puke her heart out . " It 's the same reason they 've got you . " Now that Nyle had begun to talk , he seemed intent on continuing . " Only the details are different . We 're hostages . And bait . We 're here to make sure Geradenand King Joyse do what Eremis wants.  | " I actually thought somebody would try to rescue me . " His tone made her want to throw up . Gilbur liked male meat . " But I was wrong . Maybe they 'll forget about you , too . That 's your only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " Fighting down bile , she forced herself to say , " Nobody in Orisonknew you needed rescuing . Do n't you know what they did ? They killed that physician , Underwell . They let monsters eat his face "  --  do n't think about it , do n't think about it  --  " they dressed him up to look like you . Everybody thought you were dead . " Because it had to be said , she concluded , " They thought Geraden killed you . You accomplished that , anyway . " " I know all that . " Nyle coughed thinly , as if he were too weak and beaten to curse . " They sent Gart and a couple of his Apts into the room to knock the guards and Underwell out . So there would n't be any noise . They translated me here . Then they sent some of their creatures to feed on the bodies . They told me all about it . " Do you think that 's what I wanted ? Do you think I had a choice ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel , he had been Eremis ' prisonerand Gilbur 's for a long time now , and the decisions he had made which had put him here had all been based on King Joyse 's policy of foolish passivity , it was n't fair to include him in her anger . Nevertheless she said , " Everybody has a choice . " She had a choice , did n't she ? She was chained to the wall in the dark , and Eremis intended to use her for his pleasure until her spirit broke , and there was no way she could possibly be rescued , and she still had a choice . Only dead people did n't make choices . He coughed again , like a man whose lungs were full of dry rot . She could picture him in his fetters , with his mouth hanging open iii his dirty beard and no strength . " You 're wrong , " he murmured when he was finished coughing . " You 're like Elega . You do n't know . I have n't had a choice about anything since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great . Terisa barely swallowed a snarl . Now he was going t start blaming Geraden . Her stomach tried to come up ; she had to force it down . She had already been harsher than she wanted to 1 ) c .. Instead of pursuing what Nyle said , she asked thickly , " Do you know where we are ? Do you know this place ? " " All I wanted to do was save Orison and Mordant . " Maybe he had n't heard her . " You ca n't say I deserve this . You can think I wasp394wrong , but you ca n't say I was being malicious . I was n't going to get anything out of it for myself . Not even Elega  --  Even if I was right , my family was still going to hate me . I was never going to be able to go home again . They all believed in King Joyse personally , not in the ideas that made him a good king  --  not in the Congery and Orison and Mordant . They were never going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did turned out right . " I did n't do it for myself . " " Oh , Nyle , " she breathed softly . " You do n't understand . Of course they 'll forgive you . They 've already forgiven you . " But maybe he was n't able to hear her . Maybe he had spent too much time helpless , caught in an everlasting reiteration of what he had done and why  --  and what it had cost  --  without any way to break out . Instead of reacting to what she said , he continued explaining himself . Trying to justify himself against the dark . But Geraden destroyed me . I know that was n't what he wanted , but he set me up for all this . When he came after me , instead of concentrating on Prince Kragen  --  If he were n't so determined to have accidents " He got me locked up . Like an assassin . Like I was dangerous to all the decent people around me . If I were a farmer who went berserk and started slaughtering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been locked up , but I would n't have been sneered at . I would n't have been despised . " Do n't you understand ? I love King Joyse , too . I always loved him , even though he did n't let me serve him  --  even though he did n't want me around . But some loves are more important than others . He was n't interested in my loyalty  --  and that hurt , because he was so obviously interested in my brothers . Artagel . Geraden . But I could still love his victories , his ideals , his beliefs . " What do you think I should have done ? " For a moment , Nyle 's voice brought a touch of passion into the dark . " Abandon everything that made Mordant valuable for the sake of a failing old man who did n't care whether I lived or died ? " Then Geraden stopped me , and they threw me in the dungeon . Do you know what that means ? " A coughing fit came over him , draining his intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't get away . " Artagel came and flaunted his wounds at me . I could n't getp395away . Castellan Lebbick practiced his obscenities on me for quite a while . I could n't get away . " And then Master Eremis came  --  " " Nyle , stop . " Terisa did n't want to hear it . She knew what was coming , and she did n't want to hear it . " This does n't help . You 're just tormenting yourself . " All she wanted was some way to contain the horror surging at the back of her throat so that she could concentrate , bring her fury and her dread and her ache for blood into focus . " Do you know where we are ? " " Just like that , " Nyle went on as if she had n't spoken . " He just walked into the dungeon . He just unlocked my cell and took me out . I could n't get away . " His tone frayed at the edges , worn ragged by bitterness and fatigue and coughing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He took me down the passage a little way . Then he made some kind of gesture , and we were translated here . Into his personal laborium . I could n't get away from him . " Do you know what he did to me ? " " Yes ! " Fighting for a defense against pain , Terisa jumped to her feet . " I know . " When she moved , her chain rang lightly against the wall . Quickly , she caught the chain in her fist and swung it harder , made the stone clang . " I know what he did to you . " Of course , she did n't truly know : she had n't suffered the same experience . But she knew enough  --  more than she could stomach . Fiercely , she rushed on : " He showed you a mirror with Houseldon in the Image . " She swung the chain . " And he showed you other mirrors . " The iron links chimed on the wall . " Mirrors with firecats . Mirrors with corrupt wolves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each time , she swung the chain harder . " And he made you believe he could bring them all down on your home and family without any warning of any kind if you did n't do what he wanted . If you did n't help him turn the Congery against Geraden . " Panting , gasping , she stood still . Nyle 's silence was all the acknowledgment she needed . " So you agreed because you thought you were saving most of the people you loved . And you figured somebody was bound to notice eventually that you were n't actually dead  --  which would save Geraden and recoil on Eremis . And somehow you managed to avoid the simple deduction that Eremis knew as much about the flaws in his plans as you did.  | " Nyle , you made a choice . Geraden did n't do this to you . You did it to yourself . " There . Now she had begun attacking people who were manacledto walls , accusing them of bad logic as well as weak moral fiber . As if they had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she going to do next ? Start beating up cripples ? And yet in her own case she had no one to blame but herself for the fact that she had been so slow to distrust Master Eremis , so poor at opposing him . Out of the dark , Nyle asked in old pain , " What choice did I have ? What could I have done ? " Oh , shit . She forced her fingers to release the chain . " You could have refused . " " Were n't you listening to yourself ? " He had some anger left in him after all . " If I did that , he would have destroyed Houseldon . He would have killed my whole family  --  everybody I grew up with  --  my home , all of it . " " No , Nyle , " she sighed . By degrees , she wrestled down her nausea , her racing pulse , her desire to hurt something . He was going to be hurt badly enough already . She did n't need to increase the force of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening . He destroyed Houseldon anyway . He burned it to the ground while Geraden and I were there , trying to kill us . Your cooperation did n't make any difference . You gave yourself away for nothing . " There . It was said . Far away from her , Nyle groaned softly , as if she had just slipped a knife between his ribs  --  as if she had just cut down the defenses , the self-justifications , which kept him alive in his fetters . She went to him , feeling at once as brutal as a child molester and as vulnerable as a molested child . " Nyle , I 'm sorry . " Trying to comfort him , she stroked his face . Her hand came back wet with tears . " We 'll get out of here somehow . Sometime . I 've talked to your whole family . I know they understand . They know you . They know you would n't betray Geraden unless you were trying to protect them . And it would have worked , if he had n't escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then , aching like a prayer that no one could overhear her , use what she was about to say against her , she put her mouth close to his ear and whispered , " They 're safe . They all got away . They went to the Closed Fist and dug in . To defend themselves.  | " Eremis does n't know that . " Trembling at the risk she had taken , she stepped back to the bed and waited . Nyle did n't react . She had no way of knowing whether or not he heard her . But she had done what she could for him . She had needs of her own to take into account . After a while , she returned to her first question  --  the only one of her questions which he might be in any condition to answer . " Nyle , do you know where we are ? " After a moment , he took a shuddering breath ; he seemed to be raising his head . " Esmerel , I guess . I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  translated me . But he said it was Esmerel . " " Nyle "  --  the casual threat in Master Eremis ' voice was unmistakable  --  " Itold you not to speak to her . " Stung and urgent , almost panicking , Terisa whirled to face the Master . But not panicking : she was too angry and hurt and focused for panic . " Why ? " she demanded before she had time to think , time to falter . The Imager 's shape , as vague as Vagel 's , approached her out of the doorway 's deeper black . " You 've got everything else you want . Why are you doing this to him ? He ca n't do you any harm . " " What , my lady ? " Eremis drawled . " Questions ? Challenges ? That is a poor start to our lovemaking . " He sounded confident , immaculatelysure of himself  --  and sharper than he had earlier , as if he had spent his absence enduring petty vexations . " I am surprised that you do not require to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . " Terisa brushed his words away . " I do n't care about the High King . I 'm talking about Nyle . Why do you need him ? Why do n't you let him go ? " Why have you got us chained here together ? Why do you want him to know everything you do to me ? Focus . Concentration . A blank space in the dark , a gap of existence . Anger and blood . " For the same reason I need you , my lady . " The Master 's tone was full of mirth and scorn . " To perfect my triumph . Your capture will require my enemies to march against me . They must attempt top398rescue the lady Terisa of Morgan and her strange talents . They will form an alliance , or they will not . They will destroy each other , or they will not . Whatever happens , they must come to Esmerel in the end . " Then I will release Nyle . I am not as harsh as you think me  --  I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you while we await your rescuers . " The raw-edged pleasure in his voice went through her like a chill . " And when I am ready , I will send him out to tell them what 1 have done to you . " Then Geraden will begin to understand what a burden he has undertaken by opposing me . " No . Never . Never . Concentration . Focus . " You bastard . " He was near enough to touch her now . He could have hit her . She felt his presence , the pressure he emanated ; she thought she could smell his lust . Yet he did n't hit her . " Come , my lady , " he said as if he were sure of her . " Is that how you speak to the man who will master you ? " His hand reached out ; one finger stroked the line of her cheek . When she did n't flinch , he cupped his hand around the base of her neck inside her shirt . Slowly , his grip tightened . " Must I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space ; a gap between them . She was vanishing into the darkness , groping farther and farther away from him ; groping  --  Her mind was full of Images , all of them insubstantial ; wishful thinking . " No , " she said from so far away that he would never be able to possess her . " Take my chain off . Let me show you what I 've learned from Geraden . " She made no effort to sound seductive or helpless , to conceal her distance from him . The trap she set for him was like the one he had prepared for his enemies . Obvious . And irresistible . How could he doubt that he was more than a match for her ? that he could control her , coerce her , defeat her whenever he chose ? Resistance would only make her final submission the more appalling to her . Chuckling , he took hold of her arm and clicked the fetter off her wrist . Because she was so far away , she did nothing to betray herself . And because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p399Before  he could secure his grip , she swung her leg with all her strength and kicked him in the crotch . He gasped as much in surprise as in pain ; recoiled violently from her . Almost at once , he caught his balance , recovered from the shock and hurt . She wanted to hear him cursing in agony , frothing at the mouth ; but he did n't oblige her . The oath he spat at her was simply vindictive , a promise that she had pushed him too far and was going to suffer for what she did . Quickly , he jumped forward to capture her , punish her . But not quickly enough . While he was still on his way toward her , she touched a moment of eternity . It was hardly longer than the space between one frightened heartbeat and another  --  yet it was enough . Images coalesced , took on light and shape : dozens of them ; chaos and fragments everywhere . She only needed one , however , the sharpest Image , the one with details so precise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A sand dune poised in the timeless gap between high winds and nonexistence . She had no idea where she might have seen that Image before . She did n't care . As soon as she saw it , she knew it was hers -- and a touch of cold as thin as a feather and as sharp as steel slid straight through the center of her abdomen . Eremis was grappling for her , trying to catch her by the shoulders and strike her at the same time . Only an intuitive reflexive leap enabled him to pull himself out of danger as she faded from him and fell backward into the wall . Into the light of lamps ; onto the floor so heavily that she knocked the breath out of herself . For a long moment , she could n't speak . She could n't do anythingexcept gape back up at Adept Havelock , Master Barsonage , and Geraden , who were staring at her as if she had tumbled out of coffin.  |p400The  light was extraordinary , as life-giving as sunshine . While she waited to breathe , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glow of her escape . Then Geraden let out a whoop and seemed to pounce on her . Oblivious to the fact that she could n't inhale , he swept her up into his arms and began to whirl her , crying and laughing , " Terisa ! Terisa ! " spinning her into a dance of wild joy . His happinessburned so brightly that she clung to his neck and did n't care whether she was able to breathe or not . If Master Barsonage had n't immediately clamped a massive hug around both of them , forced Geraden to stop , he would have carried her careening into the mirrors , shattering glass in all directions . " Stop , " the mediator panted . " Are you mad ? Stop . " He sounded half-delirious himself . For a moment , her relief and exaltation turned into a convulsive retch for air . At once , Geraden halted , put her down , held her tightly . " Are you all right ? Terisa , are you all right ? I could n't find you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go looking for you , but I could n't find you . I was afraid he had you for good . Oh , love , are you all right ? " She did her best to nod while the knot in her chest loosened enough to let air leak past it . Then she returned his hug , gasping in his ear , clasping him almost savagely because she was still full ofp401impossible translations and promises of murder . After her encounter with Master Eremis , Geraden was so dear to her that she held him as if her heart depended on it . Geraden . Help me . He was going to rape me . Just for the fun of it . And to hurt you . Geraden . I 'm going to kill him . " My lady , " Adept Havelock said judiciously , as if he had becomea completely different person , " that was a very pretty trick . If you can truly do such things , then every action he has taken against you is plainly justified . In his place , I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master Barsonage now that he no longer had to protect the Adept 's mirrors . " I would not have believed it . Proof " He seemed lost in the wonder of his thoughts . " Images are real , independent of their mirrors  --  independent of Imagery itself . King Joyse has been right all along . " " Fornicate that uxorious bastard , " replied Havelock , relapsing to normalcy . " A fine time to go kiting off . He should have seen this . " I 'm going toNyle ! " Geraden . " Terisa jerked back , pulled away far enough to meet Geraden 's gaze . He moved to kiss her ; the look on her face stopped him . Quickly , so that he would understand , she said , " He 's got Nyle . " He frowned , instantly sympathetic to her urgency . " We knew that , " he muttered . " Or we guessed it  --  " " I 've seen him . " Well , not seen , exactly ; but she was in too much of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eremis has him prisoner . The same place he took me . In Esmerel . " Eremis wanted him to watch what he did to me . So you would be hurt as much as possible . " We 've got to get him out of there . He 's  --  " She almost said , He 's being destroyed . Eremis is breaking his spirit . " She changed the Image , " Master Barsonage went on , caught in a kind of rapture . " Across that distance , she took a glass with an Image which did not contain her , and she shifted it until the Image did contain her . Geraden could not have done it . Flat mirrors are not his talent . And she could not have done such a thing if she were not independently real . It is inconceivable that a woman created in a mirror could have power greater than the mirror  --  and the Image  --  that created her . "  | " Who cares ? " retorted the Adept happily . " She 's female . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't trust him . " He sounded like a doting uncle . " Look at him . He 's as bad as Joyse . He 's ready to die for her . If things get dangerous , he 'll save her instead of us . " She and Geraden were n't listening . As she caught herself , they both turned automatically to look at the mirror which had brought her back to Adept Havelock 's rooms . Its Image was dark , almost impenetrably black . Maybe she could have discerned a shape or two  --  the bed ? the doorway ?  --  if she had been given time ; but before she could study the Image it began to melt away . Light bled into the darkness ; the potential for obscure shapes became mounded sand . In a moment , the glass had resumed its natural scene , the desertscape for which it had been formed . A breeze was starting to blow , lifting delicate curls of sand from the rim of the dune . " Nyle ! " A new pain shot through her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . In that room . We could have reached him  --  rescued him  --  " Holding himself steady , Geraden murmured , " It takes effort to make that shift . As soon as you relaxed , as soon as you let go , the fundamental Image came back. i hat must have beer . what happened the second day you were here , when you saw the Closed Fist in a flat glass . " It was obvious now that he was talking simply to help her , give her something to think about until she grew calmer . " You were so surprised to find the Closed Fist in my glass that you instinctively recreated the Image in the nearest flat mirror . But as soon as Eremis and I distracted you , you let go , and the fundamental Image came back . " Came back . She remembered , in spite of her distress . That Image had come back in time to let her see the Perdon 's men being attacked by rapacious black spots which chewed their hearts out . And Vagel had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annihilation of the Perdon . Curse them all . Damn every one of them . " A simple matter , " commented Havelock . He sounded as lunaticas ever , but somehow he clung to a pragmatic grasp on the situation . " Restore the change . You 've been in that room . Bring the Image back , and we 'll rescue Nyle . " He 's chained , Terisa protested inwardly . They are n't going to just stand there and let us cut him loose . Nevertheless she faced the flat glass at once , tried to push panicp403and doubt and urgency out of her mind , tried to recapture the particulardark where Eremis had held her prisonerShe could n't do it . She was too frantic ; her concentration was too badly frayed . She could n't so much as remember what the bed was like , how far away the doorway was , where the staples which had held her chain and Nyle 's were in relation to each other . And without a precise Image in her mindGeraden put an arm around her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible . " His tone was soft , soothing ; it had an undercurrent of misery and yearning , which he suppressed . He must have been through horror of his own while she was away  --  he must be frantic to rescue Nyle  --  but he put himself aside for her sake . " That 's why he keeps the important parts of Esmerel dark . That 's why I was n't able to come after you . If you shift the mirror now , you wo n't know if you 've got exactly the right piece of darkness . And if you 're wrong we might all be killed . You might produce an Image that 's actually inside a mountain somewhere , and as soon as you do any kind of translation we 'll have a few million tons of rock to deal with . You need light . " Hugging her , he repeated , " It is n't your fault . We 'll get him out some other way . " There was no authority in his voice , no unexpected strength . All he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet she found that she believed him . We 'll get him out some other way . He meant it , the same way she meant , I 'm going to kill him . Slowly , the panic in her muscles receded , and she slumped against him , mutely asking him to hold her until she had time to recover . " Geraden is right , I think . " Apparently , Master Barsonage had returned from his exaltation . " Master Eremis is cunning . Darkness is a ploy to which no Imager has ever found an answer . Even the crudest translations require light . Do not blame yourself , my lady . Already your achievements seem quite miraculous . " All right . All right . She could never fight if she let herself collapselike this . She could n't reach Nyle : all right . She could still think . Eremis had violated her with his hands . Think . He had come close to doing much worse things  --  but she got away . It was possible to chink ; choose ; act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way his arms supported her was more miraculous than any translation . He had no more intention of abandoning Nyle than she did . All right.  |p404Start  somewhere . She took a shuddering breath . " I do n't understand . How did I do it ? I was on the wrong side of the glass . I did n't think it was possible for something in an Image to translate itself out . " Geraden tightened his hug . It was the mediator who answered , however . " The Adept did that , my lady . The idea was Geraden 's , but he can do nothing with flat glass . " You are right . We know of no way for what is in an Image to translate itself out . Even for us  --  for Imagers of talent who have shaped the mirrors  --  entering a glass is nearly effortless , but bringing what is in the Image out requires gestures , invocations  --  a particular way of concentrating the Imager 's talent . After all , the mirror itself is here , not where you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sand to darkness , we could hardly fail to notice the fact . And Geraden guessed that the shift was your doing . And Havelock is an Adept . We are fortunate "  --  Barsonagesmiled sourly  --  " that he is in a mood which allowshim to react to events reasonably . After Geraden had made himself understood , the Adept performed the translation which rescuedyou . " With startling clarity , Terisa felt Master Eremis springing toward her through the dark , remembered his attack . As if she were panicking , she broke away from Geraden . But she was n't panicking ; she may have lost the capacity for panic altogether . Before Havelock could try to avoid her , she caught her arms around his neck and kissed him . Just for a second , the mad old Imager 's eyes came together ; he grinned at her like an ecstatic boy . It was amazing , really , how easily she was able to forgive him for failing to help her against Master Gilbur . Almost at once , however , his gaze split again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence . Fortunately , he did n't try to say anything . He did n't try to stop her when she turned back to Geraden . Geraden was watching her hungrily . For the first time , she realized that he had tears streaming down his face . This clear sight of him made her stop . He had known the dangershe was in . While she was Eremis ' prisoner , he had been here  --  cutoff  --  She could picture him desperately trying to bridge the gap  --  Abruptly , she locked an embrace around him . " Oh , love , " shep405breathed , aching for him . " You changed a mirror . You must have gone crazy trying to reach me . " Geraden held her hard ; but again it was Master Barsonage who answered . " Our Geraden has proved to be nearly as great a source of wonders as you are , my lady . " He sounded steady , but behind his self-control she could hear a tremor of pride and vindication . " Of course , we knew of his ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , in some sense we were not surprised when Orison 's enemies contrived the destruction of his mirror . " In shock , Terisa stiffened . The destruction  --  ? Her link with her home was gone . Then how  --  ? " Without his glass , " the mediator continued , " we believed he would be helpless . But he has shown himself an Adept in his own right , at least where normal mirrors are concerned . " Barsonage indicated a curved glass beside the flat desertscape . " He imposed an Image of Esmerel there and used it to search for you . Only the ploy of darkness prevented him from reaching you . " As she absorbed the mediator 's words , her dismay lifted . " You can do that ? " She was so pleased that she pushed back again to look into Geraden 's anguish . " You 're an Adept as well as an Imager ? That 's wonderful ! " Suddenly , she was so furious that it felt like ecstasy . " Heaven help that bastard . We 'll tear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him what he needed . She could see him shrug away his failure to rescue her , his helplessness to rescue Nyle . The lines of his face grew sharper ; his eyes cast hints of fire . " It wo n't be easy . Esmerel is two days away on a good horse . Prince Kragen thinks High King Festten has at least twenty thousand men . Not to mention all the abominations Eremis can translate . They can still use flat glass whenever they want  --  and we do n't know how they do it . " He was n't trying to daunt her . He was simply bringing up problems in order to solve them . " I do n't care about any of that , " she replied in the same spirit . " " They 've got Nyle . They 've got the Queen . High King Festten is there . Eremis talked to him this morning . They 've destroyed the I'erdon . Annihilated is the word Vagel used . They 're destroying Sternwall and Fayle . And it 's just going to get worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master Eremis had revealed about the speed , precision , and flexibility they had achieved with mirrors . While Geraden scowled at the information , and Master Bar/sonage blinked in consternation , she concluded , " We 've got to stop him before he goes any further . " The mediator started to ask a question , then subsided . But Geradenaccepted her explanation without wincing . When she was done , he said , " There 's one more thing . King Joyse is gone . " Gone  --  ? " I mean really gone . Adept Havelock says he flew away . " Geradenglanced dubiously at the mad old Imager . " I do n't know what that means . But the last we heard no one 's been able to find him . " " Then who 's in charge ? " Orison without King Joyse : the conceptwas strangely appalling . His absence was a pit yawning at her feet . " This whole thing was his idea . He wanted to fight Eremis this way . Who 's giving the orders now ? " Geraden did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as combative as she did . " We do n't know . We 've been down here most of the time . Probably nobody knows where to find us . " He hesitated , then said , " With King Joyse gone and Castellan Lebbick dead , the whole place may be collapsing . " Another flicker of hesitation . " They may have turned on the Prince . " That was true . Terisa imagined riots storming through the upper levels of the castle ; panic and bloodshed . It was conceivable that Orison might destroy itself . She wheeled on Adept Havelock . " Where is he ? This was his idea . Your idea . Curse that old man , we need him . " A sick feeling rose in her stomach as she saw Havelock hunch forward with conspiratorial glee ; his eyes nearly gyrated in opposite directions , rapacious and loony . He crooked a finger at her , summoningher near , as if he wanted to tell her a secret . She did n't move ; nevertheless he reacted as if she had come closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he whispered , " an Image , an Image . In which the women are peculiar . Their tits are on their backs . Because of this , they look very strange . But it must be delightful to embrace them . " Grinning , he concluded , " He came to me and commanded . Commanded . What could I do ? I do n't know how to beg . " His manner did n't change , yet without transition his tone turned fierce . " I have said it and said it . Hop-board pieces are men . Women make everythingimpossible . " Terisa wanted to swear at him  --  and give him a hug as if hep407needed comforting . Torn between anger and pity , she faced Geraden and Master Barsonage again . She included the mediator in what she was saying , but all of her attention and intensity were focused on Geraden . " We 've got to find out what 's going on . " Both men nodded , Barsonage willingly , Geraden in passion and approval . " Somebody has got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure it gets done . " Master Barsonage hesitated . Geraden nodded again . To the Master , she said , " We 'll explain as soon as we get the chance . King Joyse set this all up . It 's all deliberate . " Then she took hold of Geraden 's arm . Clasping each other hard , they strode away into the passage which led to the storeroom , out of Adept Havelock 's quarters . Master Barsonage followed them quickly . The bristling of his eyebrows and the frown of his concentration gave him a look of unfamiliar certainty . Behind them , Havelock picked up his featherduster and went back to cleaning his already immaculate mirrors . The particular glass he chose to work on now happened to show the Image in which he had found the flying brown cloud that he had used against Prince Kragen 's catapults . Like Castellan Lebbick , he had been abandoned . He did n't seem to be aware that he was weeping like a child . Terisa , Geraden , and Master Barsonage heard weeping , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Orison 's newer occupantshad been crowded : small children ; frightened women ; helpless oldsters and invalids . They heard shouts of alarm and fear , cries of protest and distrust . They heard blows . Once they saw several guards raise the butts of their pikes to strike at men who wanted to break out of a closed corridor . The men cursed and pleaded as they were forced back ; the rumor of Gart 's attack had reached them , and they wanted to clear a path for their families out of Orison before Cadwal 's army arrived from nowhere to butcher them all . But there was no sign of a riot . Instead of rioting , the castle was full of guards . They were everywhere , blocking the movement of people and panic , controlling accessto crucial passages or stairs or doors , facing down farmers andp408merchants and servants and stonemasons who wanted to attack or flee with their loved ones because Orison had been penetrated . " Who is in command ? " Master Barsonage demanded of the guards . " Where is King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Or the equivalent . " Where did you get your orders ? " asked Geraden . That was easier . Norge . Castellan Lebbick 's second . For the moment , the fact that Norge was actually only one of the Castellan 's seconds-in-command seemed unimportant . The point was that power still existed in Orison . It was being held together by someone from whom the guards were willing to take orders . Someonewith enough credibility to be obeyed during an emergency . Norge himself ? What gave him precedence over the other captains ? Who gave him precedence ? A Master of the Congery ? Impossible . Never in the mediator 's absence . One of King Joyse 's counselors ? One of Orison 's lords ? Unlikely . Prince Kragen himself ? Inconceivable . Artagel ? Was the situation so bad that no one could be found to take charge except Geraden 's independent-minded and slightly crippled brother ? Terisa wanted to run . She would have run if Geraden had n't held her back . As she and her companions left the castle 's lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the halls were under better control ; less frightened by the possibility of an attack by Imagery . Soon a guard appeared who saluted the mediator . " Master Barsonage , " he panted . Apparently , he had come running from the Imager 's quarters . " Geraden . The lady Terisa ? " He knew enough about the day 's events to be surprised . " You 're wanted in the King 's rooms . " The King 's rooms ? Terisa and Geraden and Master Barsonage stopped in their tracks . " The audience hall is no longer safe , " explained the guard . " Who wants us ? " demanded Barsonage instantly . Breathing hard , the guard replied , " My lord Tor . He says he 's taken command . In the King 's absence . He and Norge . Norge is the new Castellan . " The Tor . Terisa felt a surge of energy . Bless that old man ! " What about Prince Kragen ? " she asked  |p409The  guard hesitated as if he were unsure of how much he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " It 's just a rumor . I was told my lord Tor offered him an alliance . " Geraden let out a fierce cheer . Together , he and Terisa started into a run . Master Barsonage took time to pursue the question . " What was the Prince 's reply ? " The guard said , " I do n't know . " Barsonage did his best to catch up with Terisa and Geraden . In the King 's tower , more guards joined them , escorted them upward . Guards swept the King 's doors open ; Terisa , Geraden , and the mediator went in . For the sake of dignity  --  not to mention caution  --  theyslowed their pace as they entered . The King 's formal apartment was just the way she remembered it  --  richly appointed , paneled blond , carpeted in blue and red . She hardly noticed the furnishings , however . Although there were only eight or ten men  --  most of them captains  --  in the room , it seemed crowded ; too full of anxiety and passion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kragen 's voice blare like a trumpet , " I will not do it ! " Her chest tightened . She found suddenly that she was breathing harder than she had realized . The Prince 's shout seemed to throb around her , and the hope she had felt at the idea of an alliance began to curdle . On one side of Prince Kragen stood Artagel , close enough to react to what the Prince did , far enough away to dissociate himself from the Alend Contender . On the other side was a captain Terisa did n't know . Norge ? All three of them had their backs to the doors . Each in his separate way , they confronted the chair where King Joyse used to sit when he played hop-board . There sat the Tor , slumping over his great belly as if he were barely able to keep himself from oozing out of the position he had assumed . " The alternatives you propose , " the old lord was saying as if he were in a kind of pain which had nothing to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand over his face . " I will not permit you to occupy Orison , making us little more than a hostage population . I do not call that an alliance . " " And I do not call it an alliance to wait outside in danger while you sit here in safety , " retorted the Prince hotly . " If  --  no , when Highp410King Festten marches against us  --  we will be helpless while you remainsecure , watching the outcome . We must be allowed to enter Orison . I will not remain where I am , waiting for King Joyse to return  --  if he ever does return  --  and tell me his pleasure  --  if his pleasure involvesanything more productive than a game of hop-board . " The Tor did n't look strong enough to raise his head . " I understandyour dilemma , my lord Prince . Of course I do . But you can not believe that Orison 's people  --  or Orison 's defenders  --  will sit quietly on their hams while Alend takes power over them . I have already said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " No ! " Prince Kragen harked . " Do you take me for a fool ? I have no intention of making Orison 's people hostage . I will grant them precisely as much freedom and respect as the necessary crowdingof so many bodies permits . But I will not submit my forces to your authority . " Orison 's captains muttered restively . Some of them were viscerallyincensed at the idea of an alliance with Alend . And some of them had noticed Geraden and Master Barsonage  --  had noticed Terisa " My lords ! " Geraden cut in sharply . His voice carried potential authority across the room ; and a thrill prickled suddenly down Terisa'sback . " There 's no need to argue about waiting . We 're done waiting . It 's time to march ! " The Tor snatched his hand down from his face , peered bleary pain and desire at Terisa and Geraden . Artagel wheeled with joy already catching fire across his features . Norge turned more cautiously ; but Prince Kragen spun like Artagel , his swarthy face congestedwith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artagel crowed . " Geraden ! By the stars , you did it ! " As if he had never been injured in his life , he caught Geraden in an exuberant bearhug , lifted him off his feet , then dropped him to snatch up Terisa 's hand and kiss it hugely . " Everytime I see you , you 're even more wonderful ! " She wanted to hug him , but she was distracted ; there were toomany other things going on . The captains were shouting encouragement to each other , or demanding silence . And the Tor had risento his feet . Unsteadily , almost inaudibly , he murmured her name , Geraden 's . " You are indeed wondrous . " He spoke huskily , as if hewere dragging his voice along the bottom of a cave . " There must behope for us after all , if such blows can be struck against our enemies . " Prince Kragen was right behind Artagel ; he grabbed Geradenp411by the shoulders when Artagel dropped him . " How did you do it ? " the Prince demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed ? Where is King Joyse ? Did you say march ? " Somehow , Norge made himself heard through the hubbub . Hislaconic tone sounded so incongruous that it had to be heeded . " You got away , my lady . What did you learn from him ? " What did you do to him ? " In the stark silence which followed , a moment passed before she understood the point of his question . With her chin jutting unconsciously , she met the hot and eager and worried stares of the men around her . " I did n't do anything to him . " I did n't kill him . I did n't even hurt him . " But I learned enough . " Too quickly for anyone to interrupt her , she added , " Before Gilbur killed him , I had a long talk with Master Quillon . He told me what King Joyse has been doing all this time . Why he 's been acting like a passive fool . What he wanted to accomplish . Geraden is right . It 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into tumult . Only Prince Kragen had been given any hint of the things she knew ; and he had only heard pieces of the story from Geraden under the influence of too much wine , not from her . For a man like the Tor , who had spent so many miserable days praying that his besotted and stubborn loyalty would prove valuable in the end , her words must have struck as heavily as a blow . Norge and Prince Kragen and Artagel were surprised ; Master Barsonage and the captains , astonished . But the Tor 's cheeks turned the color of wet flour , and he sank down in King Joyse 's chair as if his heart were being torn out . Urgently , Terisa pushed between Artagel and Prince Kragen , hurried to the lord . " Get him some wine ! " she called . " Oh , shit . He 's having a heart attack . " My lord Tor . Are you all right ? " His hands fluttered against the arms of the chair . For a moment , he gagged as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes rolled wildly . Then , however , he took a breath that made all his fat quiver . He raised one hand to his chest , knotted it in his robe ; and his head lifted as if he were pulling it up by main strength . " Do not be alarmed , my lady , " he wheezed thinly . " The difficultyis only that I have pawned all I am for him . I have made myself contemptible for the belief that my King would at last prove worthy of service . " With remarkable celerity , one of the captains brought forward a flagon of wine . Then Tor accepted it and gulped a drink.  |p412Then  torment clenched his features . " Did you truly mean to suggest that he has been acting according to a plan  --  that the things he has done have had a purpose ? " " Yes , " she avowed at once , despite the fact that at the moment she would cheerfully have wrung King Joyse 's neck . " He did n't know you would come here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation Master Quillon had given her was n't good enough to justify the cost King Joyse had exacted from men like Castellan Lebbickand the Tor , from his daughters , from Geraden and everybody else who loved him . " His plans did n't include you . He did n't mean to hurt you . " For the time being , she supported the King , not because she approved of what he had done , but because he had left her no alternative . " All this time , he 's been working to save Mordant . " Until now . That thought was enough to turn the edges of her vision black with bitterness . King Joyse put his people through the anguish of the doomed . And just when events arrived at the point when he could have safely explained his policy , safely given at least that much meaning or justification to the people he had hurt , he chose to disappear . To go kiting off , as Adept Havelock had said . Nevertheless she took his side as if she had never doubted him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Imagers who were willing to translate abominations against people who could n't defend themselves . He did n't know where they made their mirrors , where they built their power . " When she began , she was speaking to the Tor alone ; she had n't intended to address the entire gathering . But King Joyse 's intentions carried her further than her own . As she spoke , her voice rose , and she turned partly away from the Tor to include everyone in the room . " He knew they needed soldiers to back up their Imagery . Imagerycan destroy , but rule requires manpower . But he did n't know what alliances they might have made , with Cadwal or Alend . There was only one thing he could be sure of . As long as he was the strongestruler here  --  as long as Mordant was strong enough to fight back both Cadwal and Alend  --  the renegades would leave him alone . They would chip away at the Alend Lieges , or find a way to swallow Cadwal  --  butthey would leave him alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She had to raise her voice more , until she was nearly , shouting . That was the only way she could control her frustration and grief.  |p413He  had smiled at her so gloriously that she would have done anything for him . And he had caused so much pain " The only way he could find out who they were , how they worked , where their power was before they grew too strong  --  the only way he could bring them out into the open  --  was to make himselfweak . He had to convince everybody , everybody , that he had lost his will , his sense , his determination . He had to make himself the only reasonable target . " So that they would attack here . " So that he would have a chance to stop them . A chance to surprise them by turning their own traps against them . " She had ruined that , of course . She had warned Eremis . Her bitterness included herself : she had n't earned the right to be selfrighteous . Yet her culpability only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do . I do n't know why he is n't here . He 's been working toward this moment for years . I do n't know why he 's abandoned us now . " If he went to rescue Queen Madin  --  That was understandable , but it did n't help . At that distance , he would n't be able to return until long after the battle was decided . Terisa made an effort to steady herself , calm her raw anger . " It does n't matter . We 're still here . We still have to save Orison and Mordant . " We do n't have any choice . He has n't left us any choice . The only thing we can do is what he would do if he were here . We 've got to march . " The room was still ; the men around her listened with all their senses , avidly . Geraden 's face shone as if nothing could stop him now . Artagel nodded to himself happily . Prince Kragen 's eyes were lark with dismay and calculation  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Master Barsonage gaped , his mouth hanging open ; he gave the impression that he was reeling inside . " March , " muttered the Tor , struggling to straighten his spine against the back of his chair . " So that they would attack here . ' My old friend . How I must have hurt you . " Finally , however , it was Norge who asked the obvious question . " March where , my lady ? " She was so full of pressure that she could hardly articulate the word : " Esmerel . " At once , Geraden supported her . " That 's Eremis ' family Seat . Apparently , that 's where he has his laborium . That 's where he andp414Gilbur took her . And Vagel is there . Gart is there . Cadwal is there . Eremis consulted with the High King there this morning . " That 's where we need to strike . " Terisa was thinking , In the Care of Tor . Where those riders with the red fur and the hate-filled eyes had come from to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted on horses with tack from the Tor 's Care . The old lord 's mind was running in a completely different direction , however . " That explains it , then , " he rumbled . He braced himself upright with an arm on one side , an elbow on the other . Canted in this posture as if his weight were about to overturn the chair , he muttered , " That is why he told Lebbick to do whatever he wanted to her . He had to appear weak  --  had to seem like he had lost his reason . He had to persuade me . If I had failed to believe him , I could have betrayed him to Eremis . " At the same time , he sent Master Quillon to remove her from the dungeon , so that no one would suffer from his feigned weakness  --  sothat Lebbick would not have a crime on his heart  --  so that she would not be harmed . " At last I understand . " The Tor looked like a man whose hands had just been released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march now , " Geraden went on in a tone which Terisa would have found impossible to refuse . " In Esmerel , the lady Terisa discovered Nyle alive . " That announcement snatched most of the eyes in the room to him . Something in Artagel leaped up : his expression was as keen as a honed blade . " I did n't kill him . " Geraden spoke through his teeth , restraining outrage . Now he did n't need the strange authority which sometimes came to him : his bone-bred passion was enough . " I never lifted a hand against him . Eremis forced his help by threatening my family . Our family , " he said to the sharpness in Artagel 's face . " Nyle pretendedI stabbed him . Then Eremis carried him off . He called for the physician Underwell , who was almost exactly Nyle 's size and coloring . He had Underwell butchered by creatures of Imagery . Then he dressed Underwell in Nyle 's clothes to make it look like I came back to finish what I started . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captains . They stared at Geraden in undisguised astonishment.  | " But Nyle is still alive . Eremis has him chained to a wall in Esmerel . To use against me if I ever try to fight him . " I 'm a son of the Domne . " Geraden held himself powerfully still . " My family have been dear and loyal friends to King Joyse and Mordant from the beginning , and I want my brother rescued ! " Yes ! Terisa said with the way she lifted her head , the way she carried herself . Yes . " It 's a simple question , really , " Artagel drawled into the silence when Geraden was finished . His nonchalant manner contrasted dramaticallywith the flame of combat in his eyes . " As my lady Terisa says , we do n't have any choice . We 've already let the Perdon be destroyed . " His stance was casual , but his hands curled as if they ached to hold a sword . " If we do n't return to King Joyse 's policy of supporting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that holds Mordant together , whether Eremis and Festten beat us or not . Everything that made Mordant worthwhile will be gone . " Terisa smiled at him . She was trying to express thanks , gratitude ; but the tension in her muscles made her grin too fierce for that . The Tor took a deep breath , then gasped . The flagon dropped from his hand , spilling wine across the rug ; but he did n't notice it . He looked at Norge , nearly squinting to get his eyes into focus ; he looked at Prince Kragen . " I am content . " His voice was flat , curiously unresonant . Apparently , Gart 's kick still pained him . " Let us call the matter settled . Tomorrow we will march against Master Eremis in Esmerel . " Terisa wanted to applaud until she heard Prince Kragen rasp , " No . " " My lord Prince ? " A fine dew of sweat covered the Tor 's forehead . " I am not content . " Kragen chewed the words under his moustacheas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not call the matter settled . You have proposed an alliance  --  on which we have been utterly unable to agree . Now you announce your intention to march away on a fool 's mission . Is it your intention that Alend should march with you ? " His tone sounded oddly conflicted to Terisa , at once furious and hungry , as if his passion had another name than the one he chose to give it . " Is that what an alliance means to you now ? Do you believe that the Alend Monarch will be content to let all his strength commit suicide beside you , for no other reason than because you have deidedto die insanely ? " Artagel started to retort ; Geraden stopped him. p 416 " You have a better idea , my lord Prince ? " Geraden asked . His voice made Terisa shiver : it was thick with hinted promises or threats . " Of course ! " the Prince snapped . " An alliance here . In Orison . Let the High King come against us here and do his worst . Together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nyle ? " demanded Artagel , unable to restrain himself . Geraden ignored his brother . " I do n't think so , " he answered Prince Kragen . " Eremis does n't need to come here . He can attack us anywhere by Imagery . While we stay in one place , any place , we 're powerless , vulnerable . Without risking one Cadwal , he can fill Orison with enough horrors to leave even you screaming , my lord Prince . The only reason he has n't done it so far is that he is n't ready . Was n't ready . All he needed is time . He 's ready now . If we do n't carry the fight to him now , High King Festten and his twenty thousand men wo n't have to do anything except come here at their leisure and clean out the ruins . We 'll all be dead or scattered . " As well as she could , Terisa controlled her frustration at Prince Kragen , her fear of the things she remembered . " Eremis  --  " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to use flat glass safely . He 's discovered an oxidate which lets him translate a flat glass into a curved one , so that whatever is in the curved Image can be translated straight to whatever is in the flat Image . " Master Barsonage and Geraden had had time to absorb this information . They did n't flinch . And they did n't interrupt her . " Did n't Geraden tell you ? " she asked the Prince . " Eremis dropped an avalanche out of nowhere onto Vale House . That 's how he was able to kidnap Queen Madin . And he has a flat mirror with the audience hall in the Image . He could bring an avalanche in there right now if he wanted to . And we know he has at least two other mirrors that show parts of Orison . His rooms . That place in the lower levels  --  near the dungeons . Maybe he has more . " But that 's not all . Vagel  --  the arch-Imager Vagel  --  has devised a system that allows him to create specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite the fact that she had already told Master Barsonage this , the mediator looked like he was on the brink of apoplexy . " And Gilbur has the talent to make mirrors quickly , " Terisa continued . " Together , they can shape enough Images to attack Orisonanywhere , anytime.  | " Eremis is ready now . It is n't suicide to march . It 's suicide to stay here . " A murmur rose from the captains  --  agreement , worry , caution . " Perhaps . " For a moment , Prince Kragen 's eagerness seemed to outweigh his outrage . " Perhaps in that , you are right . " As if by an act of will , however , he brought back his indignation . " Yet if it is madness to remain here , it is not therefore sane to march against Esmerel . " He glanced at the Tor . Briefly , he appeared to consider addressinghis challenge to Terisa . But at last he turned to Geraden and Artagel , drawn to them by the blood-claim of Nyle 's imprisonment  --  and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You have some acquaintance with Esmerel , I suppose ? " Artagel nodded without hesitation . Geraden said distinctly , " Some . " " I have heard reports of the terrain . Who will be favored in a battle there ? " " Good question , " Norge observed equably . Artagel grinned . " Whoever gets there first . The entrenched forces can pick their ground . It 's a trap for whoever arrives second . " Geraden shook his head , dismissing the issue . " Why do you think Eremis chose that place , my lord Prince ? You did n't think it was an accident . You did n't think High King Festten drove twenty thousand men there just for the pleasure of annihilating the Perdon . " " No , Geraden "  --  Prince Kragen allowed himself a snarl of sarcasm  --  " Idid not think it was an accident . It is your thinking I question , not my own . Did you not hear Artagel use the word trap ? You say that Nyle is intended as a hostage against you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march to Esmerel is precisely the action Eremis wishes us to take . " " Of course , " Geraden retorted . " That 's one reason I was captured , " commented Terisa . " More bait . Eremis wanted to have me where I could n't hurt him . " He wanted to rape me . He wanted to break Geraden . " But he also wanted to make sure you went to Esmerel . All of you . " " Everything he 's ever done us to us is a trap , " Geraden continued. " that 's his great strength  --  and his great weakness . " " And you still believe we should go ? " Prince Kragen 's protest was an inextricable mixture of excitement and fury . " Knowing he has set this trap to destroy us , you believe that we should accommodatep418him  --  that we should rush to put our necks in his noose for him ? Geraden , you are mad . " Wheeling toward the Tor , he unleashed a shout . " My lord , this is madness ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stale dough and waited for Geraden 's answer . To Terisa 's surprise , Geraden started laughing . His laughter was like Artagel 's grin : bloody-minded ; ready for battle . " That 's KingJoyse 's method . His policy . Do n't you understand ? He sets his traps inside Eremis ' . If he were here to spring them himself , it , would make your head reel . But he is n't here , so we 've got to do it for him . We 've got to put our necks in Eremis ' noose  --  and then take it away from him . We 've got to walk into his trap and turn it against him . " Prince Kragen stared as if Geraden were breaking out in boils . So flabbergasted that his sarcasm deserted him , he asked , " How  --  ? How do you think we can do that ? He has at least twenty thousand men . He has Imagery . He has the terrain . He has at least one hostage . How can we possibly turn his trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " By being stronger than he expects . " When Geraden said that , Terisa permitted herself a sigh of relief . Master Barsonage jerked up his head , listening intently . The Tor brushed a hand through the sweat on his forehead , then rubbed his fingers on his robe . " How ? " Prince Kragen pursued , nearly whispering . " In what way are we stronger than he expects ? " Geraden shrugged . " For one thing , there 's no way he could have planned for Terisa 's talent  --  or mine either . That 's why he 's worked so hard to distract us , confuse us , keep us guessing . He did n't know what he was up against  --  and he did n't want us to find out what we can do . He could n't possibly know I 'm an Adept , of a certain kind . I can shift the Images in normal mirrors , whether I made them or not . " That is true , " Master Barsonage averred . " I have witnessed it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geraden went on . " WhatI do with curved glass , she can do with flat mirrors . And she 's anarch-Imager . She can pass through flat glass without losing her mind . And she can use her talent across incredible distances . That 's howshe escaped . From as far away as Esmerel , she shifted a mirror herep419until she was in the Image . Then Adept Havelock translated her out of danger . " " That also is true . " The mediator of the Congery seemed to be taking bulk with every passing moment , growing larger or more substantialas the tenets of Imagery were altered . " I have witnessed it . " And I am another way in which we are stronger than Master Eremis expects . " Prince Kragen swung to face Master Barsonage . Geraden and Artagel turned . Terisa studied the Tor to be sure he was holding himself together , then directed her attention to the mediator . " I mean that the Congery is stronger , " Barsonage amended as if his own certainty surprised him . " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ? Generally , we are little more than a body of discontented ditherers . And all our actions in defense of Mordant  --  and of ourselves  --  went awry . Oh , the augury we cast for Mordant 's future was well done . On the other hand , the summoning of our champion was a disaster . Why should anyone esteem us ? We did not esteem ourselves enough to preserve our own usefulness after we saw how badly we had gone wrong with our champion . " But then we learned of Geraden 's talent  --  and of the lady Terisa 's . That restored us immeasurably . We did not know whether these new talents would be used to harm or benefit us . No , Artagel , " he digressed , " even after your explanations , we still had room for doubt . But we knew now that our work was vital  --  that we had unleashed forces which only we could support or oppose  --  that the Congery had at last come into its own significance . " Therefore we set to work as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been vindicated . " That was the linchpin of Master Barsonage 's new sureness . " We have been given proof that King Joyse was always in the right  --  that Images possess their own full independent reality , that the things we see in mirrors are not created by Imagery . The Congery 's establishment has been justified . " I le was elevated by clarity ; his face shone . " the translations of Master Eremis and Master Gilbur and the arch-Imager Vagel are not merely evil in their consequences , but also in their means . " " The point , " growled Prince Kragen . " Come to the point . " " My lord Prince , " the mediator announced , " my lord Tor , MasterEremis is ready . That is evident . The Congery is ready also . In the name of King Joyse  --  and of Mordant 's need  --  we are prepared to do battle at your side against Esmerel. "  | " How ? " The Prince had an unflagging interest in that question . " What can you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a smirk . " My lord Prince , you have not agreed to an alliance . For that reason , I will not discuss our weapons with you . But two things I will tell you . First , our weapons violate none of the strictures which King Joyse has placed upon the Congery . And second "  --  he paused for a moment of frank self-congratulation  --  " until weapons are necessary , we can supply the march to Esmerel . " Prince Kragen 's mouth formed the word supply without a sound . " We can not translate men , of course , " the mediator explained , " but we are prepared to move food , swords , bedding , or tents in whatever quantity you require . You will be able to travel without supply-wains , without the vast entourage of camp followers and porterswhich slows you . You will be able to reach Esmerel more swiftly than Master Eremis can possibly guess . " My lord Prince , does that not make us stronger ? " " And then there 's the matter of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover from his surprise . " Eremis must know it 's a possibility , but he ca n't expect it . What do you have , my lord Prince ? Roughly ten thousand men ? " The Prince nodded dumbly . " And what about us , Castellan Norge ? " Norge consulted the ceiling . " Near eight thousand altogether . We can put six thousand on the road and still leave enough here to keep the defenses going for a while . " " My lord Prince "  --  Geraden spoke carefully , controlling his emotion  --  " Eremis does n't expect to face an army of sixteen thousand . High King Festten does n't expect it . They do n't want to fight us . They want to overwhelm us . " He did n't need to say the word , annihilate : it was implicit in his tone . " And they do n't have the strength to overwhelm sixteen thousand men . " For a few moments , Prince Kragen did n't answer ; he chewed his moustache and glowered at his thoughts . Geraden kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be wondering whether this might be an opportune time for a nap . In contrast , Artagel was barely able to refrain from hopping from foot to foot like an excited boy . The Tor clamped both arms over his belly as if he feared that something inside him might burst . Abruptly , the Prince turned to face the old lord . He cocked his fists on his hips . Terisa could n't tell which tookp421precedence in him , his eagerness or his anger ; but he did n't prolong the suspense . " My lord Tor , " he said clearly , " you ask too much . " The Tor raised an inquiring hand , lifted an eyebrow . The effort brought sweat rolling down the bridge of his nose . " If this alliance you propose fails , " Kragen articulated , " you can retreat to Orison . You have two thousand men for a final defense . I have nothing . All the Alend Monarch 's might will be destroyed , and my people will have no defense left between the Pestil River and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire monarchy on this business of necks and nooses . " I will not go . I advise you not to go . " Terisa wanted to yell at him ; she wanted to hit him with her fists . Do n't you understand ? We 've got to try . She contained herself , however , because Geraden was clenched still , unprotesting , and Artagelhad gone ominously quiet . In a dull rumble , the Tor asked , " What do you advise , my lord Prince ? " " Fight for Orison as long as you can , " replied the Prince . " Then join me across the Pestil . Bring the Fayle and the Termigan  --  bring the Armigite , if you can bear him  --  and add your forces to mine . With the Alend Lieges behind us , we will make Eremis and Festten pay dearly for every foot of ground they take . " To himself , the Tor made a muttering noise , as if he were consideringthe idea . But before Terisa could panic  --  before Geraden could intervene  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might fall , she reached out to support him . What was left of his hair straggled with sweat ; his skin had a gray underhue , as if his heart pumped ashes rather than blood ; his eyes were glazed , nearly opaque . Nevertheless he spoke as if no one could doubt that he would be obeyed . " Castellan Norge , do you hear me ? " " I hear you , my lord Tor . " Norge sounded vaguely somnolent : detached ; impervious to argument . " Escort my lord Prince out of Orison . I want him returned safely to his father . Safely and politely . Do you hear me ? " " I hear you , my lord Tor . " " We march against Esmerel at dawn . Be ready . Confer with the Congery on the matter of supplies . " Master Barsonage nodded assent.  | " Yes , my lord Tor . " This time , there was a small bite in Norge 's tone , a touch of grim happiness . Prince Kragen threw up his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grin . He was unarmed , but at the moment he did n't look like he needed a weapon . " You 're talking about marching into the teeth of the siege . Is that wise , my lord Tor ? Should n't we keep Prince Kragen with us ? A hostage of our own ? If we let him go , he can cut us down as soon as we ride out of here . " " No , " the Tor said at once . The flatness in his tone was turning to nausea . " That the Alend Contender will not do . He knows where we go , and why . He may well resume his attack on Orison when we are gone . For that reason , we will leave two thousand men behind us , and someone reliable to lead them . But he will not harm or hinder us . Terisa wanted to ask , Are you sure ? The mix of emotions on Prince Kragen 's face was too complex to give her much confidence . Maybe that was what he planned : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Unexpectedly , however , the Prince 's excitement seemed to gain the upper hand for a moment . " Thank you , my lord Tor . " He spoke softly ; yet his voice carried a hint of trumpets . " Rely on my respect . If my father 's friends were as honorable as King Joyse 's , Alend would have no need of Contendersto win the Seat . " Kragen turned to go . Norge sent two captains to accompany him until more guards could be mustered . Nevertheless Terisa did n't see his departure . She was busy trying to catch the Tor 's great weight as it tumbled to the floor . The old lord had fainted.  |p423Terisa  and Geraden wanted to talk to Artagel  --  theywanted to know in detail what had happened in Orisonduring their absence  --  but for most of the day he had no time . He was busy with Norge , supporting the new Castellan 's authority , and the Tor 's , against anyone who doubted it , distrusted it . Of course , he had no official standing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only increased his credibility . He was Artagel , the best swordsman in Mordant  --  and a son of the Domne . Since King Joyse 's decline , he was the closest thing Orison had to a popular hero . And he was n't actually a member of the guard  --  was n't actually under Norge 's command . His word , his simple presence at Norge 's side , threw more weight than half a dozen catapults . Failing Artagel , Terisa and Geraden would have been content with Master Barsonage . But the mediator was busy as well . He had to ready the Congery for battle . And he had to make all the arrangements for supplying the guard . In practice , this meant determiningwith Norge 's seconds what supplies were necessary , in what quantities , and then issuing explicit instructions for the placement of those supplies in manageable piles in the vast disused ballroom outside the laborium . Since the Congery had rediscovered its sense of purpose , the Masters had been busy . Working from the formula Barsonage had used to create the mirror of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat glass which showed the ballroom . With as much hastep424as possible , two other Masters had succeeded at duplicating that new mirror ; one glass alone would have been too slow  --  and would have placed too much strain on the Master who had made it . Along with its other weapons , the Congery intended to carry these mirrors on the march . Then the supplies which had been piled in the ballroom could be translated to Orison 's army at need . Because the mediator had to put these plans into effect , Terisa and Geraden were left with no comfortable source of information . Ribuld was almost gleefully glad to see them . Especially after Lebbick 's death  --  which he had been unable to prevent  --  the scarred veteran was eager to assign himself the job of protecting them . And he was happy to talk . From him , they heard about Saddith 's fate . On the other hand , he could n't answer the pertinent questions  --  could n't explain , for instance , how the maid had come to serve as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know the things Terisa and Geraden most wanted to hear . For most of the day  --  what was left of it , at any rate  --  they had to rely on each other 's company . This did n't particularly distress them . They had given the Tor over into the care of a physician , who had assured them that the old lord had the constitution of a stoat and would almost certainly recover as soon as he began to consume a diet more nourishing than wine alone  --  with the proviso , of course , that Gart 's kick had n't produced any interior bleeding . After the physician had reassured them , Terisa and Geraden went to her formerrooms in the tower , the peacock rooms . They explained to Ribuld that they were waiting to talk to either Artagel or Master Barsonage ; and Ribuld promised to hound Artagel and the mediator with reminders . Then they closed the door and bolted it . Suddenly giddy with relief and suppressed hysteria , they wedged a chair into the wardrobe  --  where her clothes still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . " Anybody who tries to sneak in here , " he said , " is going to crack his shins . " Laughing so that they would n't weep , they welcomed each other back as if they had been apart for months . " Ah , love , " he murmured some time later , when he had become calm , " I came so close to reaching you . That was worse than being helpless , I think . There I was , doing something so amazing that it turns everything we know about Imagery upside down , and Eremisp425made it all useless just by putting out the lights . " He paused , then admitted , " Havelock had to sit on me to keep me from going after you anyway . " But you were n't really helpless , were you . " This was important to her . As always , what she said was more interesting to him than his own pain . " What do you mean ? " " You could n't reach me , " she explained , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power there must have been dozens of things you could have done . You could have translated guards into Esmerel to look for me . Hundreds of them . " He peered at her in a way that made her want to hug him again because he so obviously was n't hurt , did n't interpret what she said as criticism . All he said was , " I did n't have time . " " I know that , you idiot . " Instead of hugging him , she tickled his ribs . " That 's not the point . " He caught her hand by the wrist and punished her attack by nibbling gently on the tips of her fingers . Between nips , he asked , " What is the point ? " " The point is "  --  it was amazing , really , just how much difficulty she had concentrating while he sucked her fingers  --  " You were n't helpless . If I had n't done that shift , you could have found a way to strike back . You would have found a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You were n't helpless . " " Of course I 'm helpless , " he replied around her fingers . " I 'm completely at your mercy . " " Idiot , " she said again . But she did n't have any trouble thinking of something to do fur him while he was at her mercy . Still later , when her own sense of postponed fright had receded , she murmured softly into his shoulder , " What would we have done ? " He analyzed that for a while before he remarked , " I have no ilea what you 're talking about . " " If the Tor had n't agreed with us , " she explained . " If Norge had n't agreed with him . If they had n't put themselves in charge of Orison . What would we have done ? " He stared up at one of the peacock-feather decorations on the wall . " Well , somebody had to take command . We would have persuadedhim . " " And what if he turned us down ? "  |p426Geraden  considered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince Kragen . We would have tried to persuade him  --  or Elega  --  or maybe even Margonal himself  --  to back us up . " I know , " he added when she started to object , " Prince Kragen is the one who wants to stay here . But that 's only because the Tor wants to go . If he did n't have any hope of an alliance with Orison  --  if he knew he could n't get in here without spending all the lives that would take , making himself that much weaker  --  he might have been persuaded to march . If Elega took our side . If he thought he did n't have anything else to try . " " And what , " she continued , " if we could n't persuade him . " He shrugged under her head . " Then we probably would have to get back into Orison . We 'd have to get anybody who agreed with us  --  Artagel , maybe some of the Masters , maybe some friends of Ribuld 's  --  and use one of Adept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise raid . " She reached across his chest to hug him . " So we would n't have given up . He held her hard . Through his teeth , he muttered , " You suit yourself . I would n't give up if I had to walk there alone and take Esmerel apart with my fingernails . " That was what she wanted to hear . Feeling at once more relaxed and readier for battle , she asked casually , " Has it occurred to you that we 're luckier than we look ? " " Luckier ' ? " he inquired . " Or King Joyse is . If it were n't for Elega , we probably would n't have been able to talk our way in here . If it were n't for the Castellan "  --  shefelt a pang whenever she remembered Lebbick  --  " Gart would probably , have killed you and Artagel and Prince Kragen and the Tor . If it were n't for the Tor , Orison might be in chaos by now . Eremis has n't won yet . We 're still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting . " Geraden kissed her , but she did n't stop . " We 've been lucky . " In an unexpectedly somber tone , he returned , " Or King Joyse is better at this game than anybody realizes . " She nodded . After a moment , she said , " I wonder why he ca n't beat Havelock at hop-board . " Geraden looked at her sharply . " That 's an interesting question . Do you suppose it 's just because Havelock is out of his mind most of the time ? " That sounded plausible . Terisa started to say , I guess so . Butp427then , unaccountably , she remembered the time Adept Havelock had come to her rooms  --  had sneaked in through the secret passage and taken her to Master Quillon , so that Quillon could give her the raw materials with which to think about Mordant 's need . He had n't exactlybeen in one of his lucid phases . And yet he had saidShe groped for the memory momentarily ; then it came to her , as clear as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The King tries to protect his pieces . King Joyse had protected her , protected Geraden . Had tried to protect the Tor . At some personal cost , he had done what he could to protect his wife and daughters . It was even conceivable that he had tried to protect Castellan Lebbick . Individuals . What good are they ? Worthless . It 's all strategy . Sacrificethe right men to trap your opponent . Maybe that was the truth . Maybe King Joyse could n't outplay the Adept because he could n't match Havelock 's ruthlessness . Maybe that was why he was gone now . Maybe he was out on a mad chase after Torrent and Queen Madin , driven by a need to protect individuals without regard to his overall strategyDid that fundamental flaw cripple everything ? Was his policy fatally marred by his inability to sacrifice individuals for the sake of something larger ? Geraden must have felt her shivering : he tightened his arms around her suddenly . " Terisa , " he murmured , " love . What 's the matter ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea scaring her was too elusive , almost metaphysical . Instead , she said , " Do you remember the time King Joyse asked me to find a way out of a stalemate ? It was the day after Master Gilbur translated his champion . " That memorydid little to improve her morale . " You rescued me from the Castellan by persuading the Tor to send for me in King Joyse 's name . Geraden nodded . " I remember . " " After you got me to the King 's rooms , " she continued for her own sake rather than for his , strengthening her grip on what she meant , " he showed me a hop-board problem . A stalemate . He said Havelock set it up for him . He said there was a way out , but he could n't find it . " Her shivers mounted . " So I tipped all the men off the board . No more stalemate . " " I remember , " Geraden repeated , trying to steady her.  | " I think I almost made him sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , To you , it 's just a game . To me , it 's the difference between life and ruin . And he had said , I suggest that you give the matter more considerationbefore you once again attempt to end a stalemate by tilting the board . " Geraden , what if that 's what we 're doing ? Tilting the board ? " Instead of doing what King Joyse wants . Protecting his pieces . Or what Havelock wants . Sacrificing the right men . " Do you think we should go alone ? " Geraden countered . " Against Eremis and Gilbur and Vagel and terrible Imagery and twenty thousand men ? " Abruptly , her trembling stopped ; it fell away from her like an old panic fading into the dark . " No , " she said distinctly . That would be sacrificing men for no reason . " We would n't stand a chance . Even if we could fight all that Imagery , we could n't stop High King Festten . " It 's just that I agree with King Joyse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in the lurch . At first , I was angry . But now I think I 'm starting to understand . " Geraden studied her face . " Terisa , you are n't making any sense . " I know . " She mustered another indirect effort to explain herself . " Did I ever tell you about Reverend Thatcher ? " " The man who ran the mission ' where you served before I came to you . " She kissed Geraden 's nose quickly . " I probably told you he was futile . Sad  --  hopeless . He must have felt that way . But he taught me something  --  Something I did n't understand for a long time . " He was trying to help the most miserable people in the city . Indigents . Street people . Crazies . Drunks . Trying to give them food and clothing and maybe shelter . And that was hard because nobody wanted to pay for it . If you feed and clothe and shelter them today , what have you accomplished ? All you 've done is save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing and shelter tomorrow . So if you have money and want to do some good , giving it to that mission is like throwing it away . There must be hundreds of things you can use your money for that would do more good for the city as a whole . " " Yes , but  --  " began Geraden . " Yes , but , " she agreed . " Doing good for the city as a whole would n't make those poor people go away . It would n't make theirp429misery go away . And Reverend Thatcher could n't stop caring about them . If you gave him a choice between "  --  she searched for an example  --  " Ido n't know , between free education for the whole city and helping one drunk get through another day with a hot meal , he 'd choose to help the drunk . Not because he did n't think education is important , but because he could n't help caring about the drunk . " Maybe that 's sad . Maybe it 's even stupid . It 's certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stopped as if she had made herself clear . Geraden had to struggle for a couple of minutes , but eventually he reached the conclusion she had n't been able to articulate . " King Joyse , " he said slowly , " persuaded you he was right by abandoning us . You think he went after Torrent  --  after Queen Madin . When somebody he loves is in danger , he forgets all about Mordant  --  all about his plans for saving his kingdom . He leaves that to us . Not because he does n't think Mordant is important , but because he ca n't help caring about her . " Terisa 's spirit lifted . " He is n't an idealist  --  not really . If anyone here is an idealist , it 's Havelock . King Joyse did n't create Mordant and the Congery out of an abstract set of beliefs . He did it because people he knew and cared about were being hurt in the wars  --  hurt by Imagery . He wanted to save the world , a world made up of individualfarmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't forget that he risked a lot to protect us . Treating us the way he did , he confused us  --  even hurt us . But that gave Eremis a reason not to kill us . And we were left free to make our own choices . Just to keep us alive , King Joyse took the risk that we might go against him completely . Just to protect our lives and our choices . " And , " she concluded , " he trusts us to do the same thing for him . He trusts us to defend Mordant for him while he 's out trying to rescue his wife . " As if a knot of tension had been released in him , Geraden collapsedback on the bed . Happily , he said , " I knew there was some good reason why I love that old man . " " Besides , " she went on , now that she was sure of herself ; " we are n't the ones who want to tilt the board . That 's what Eremis is doing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are n't making that mistake . " " No , " he assented . Eagerness brightened his eyes and animatedp430his features , making him inexpressibly precious to her . " We are n't making that mistake . " For the time being , she was content . Just when it seemed , however , that she had reached the point where she no longer worried about what anybody else in Orison did , Master Barsonage arrived in answer to Ribuld 's messages . She and Geraden kept the mediator waiting only long enough to put on some clothes ; then they admitted him to her sitting room . " Sleeping all day while Orison bustles , I see , " the Imager commentedpleasantly while he closed the door . He looked happier than she had ever seen him : activity and a clear sense of purpose agreed with him . " Well , doubtless you need the rest . I can only imagine the exertions and perils which you have endured . " Since my imagination has not been all it should be , as you know "  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then shrugged his thick shoulders  --  " I am eager to hear what has happened to the rest of Mordant . The siege has cut us off completely , " he explained . " We know nothing but what we have learned from you and Prince Kragen . " Terisa blew a sigh . " That 's going to take a while , " she said ; and Geraden went to the door , chuckling . Outside , he asked Ribuld for wine and food . Ribuld made some retort she did n't catch ; then Geraden returned . " Ribuld says we can have anything we want , if we do n't mind waiting . Apparently , there 's no end of servants available , but the kitchens are in chaos , trying to get supplies "  --  he glowered humorouslyat Master Barsonage  --  " ready for tomorrow . " " That is true , " replied the mediator with a nod . " An appalling situation , in fact . No one knows what to do . Norge or one of his captains has to make every decision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every conceivable eventuality  --  except a march . " And , of course , every man who carries a sack of meal or a keg of water or a bale of hay to the ballroom goes in terror of his life , expecting to be translated away into madness at any moment . " Master Barsonage permitted himself a growl of disgust . " If Norge were not so phlegmatic  --  and if Artagel were less supportive  --  we would be in worse danger of riots now than at any other time today . " Terisa and Geraden glanced at each other . " As Terisa says , " Geraden remarked to the mediator , " our story is going to take ap431while . Why do n't we wait for supper ? " He set two chairs facing MasterBarsonage and sat down in one of them ; following his example , Terisa took the other . " Maybe by then Artagel will join us , and we wo n't have to go over the same things twice . " In the meantime , you can tell us how the preparations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked doubtfully at Geraden 's proposal ; he seemed to think Geraden intended to avoid answering him . Almost at once , however , he inhaled deeply , shook his head as if to rearrange his thoughts , and smiled in acquiescence . While Terisa and Geraden listened intently , storing up information they might need , Master Barsonage described how the Congeryplanned to transport their mirrors  --  no simple problem , consideringthat the mirrors would have to be moved over hard road and uneven ground by horse cart . With deliberate frankness  --  perhapsreproaching Geraden 's evasion  --  he discussed the chief weapon the Masters had devised , as well as the secondary actions they were equipped to take . That brought a shine to Geraden 's eyes , made Terisa grip herself hard to keep her excitement in perspective ; but neither of them interrupted as the mediator went on to explain the arrangements he had designed for the supplies in the ballroom , so that Orison 's people could replenish the piles of stores without any risk of being inadvertently taken by a translation . When he was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could on the state of the castle . So far , the Tor 's authority and Norge 's were being accepted without much resistance : eagerly by most of the guard , men who favored almost any change which promised action ; and eagerly as well by the servants , for whom the departure of six thousand guards would mean that much less work ; more stoically by Orison 's visiting population , people who felt King Joyse 's absence keenly in theory , but in practice found Artagel 's assurances persuasive ; with ill grace and no little suspicion by many of King Joyse 's minor lords and functionaries  --  excise-tax assessors , for example , or storeroom accountants , or secretaries to the Home Ambassador  --  men whose entire existence depended on the King , on his style of kingship . And without any active opposition to the Tor or Norge , most of Orison 's social machinery continued to function . Meals were cooked , despite the chaos Ribuld had described . I falls were patrolled , guarding against unrest  --  and against attacks of Imagery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p432In  short , thanks to the Tor 's quick assumption of authority , and to Norge 's demonstrated acceptance , and to Artagel 's grinning support , Orison remained almost miraculously intact after King Joyse 's disappearance . " Thank the stars , " Geraden breathed when Master Barsonage was done . " You 're right , Terisa . We 're luckier than we look . " Then his eyes narrowed , and his lips pulled tight over his teeth . " I wonder how many times Eremis has thought he could get away with laughing at the Tor . If he can see us now , he is n't laughing anymore . " " And he is n't laughing at the Congery , " Terisa put in , partly to please Master Barsonage , and partly because the mediator had impressedher . " Or he wo n't be , when he finds out what he 's up against . " " Thank you , my lady , " Barsonage replied quietly . " We have been useless for a long time , while we distrusted both our King and ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be effective at last . " " If only Prince Kragen had listened to us , " Geraden mused . " Or if he changes his mind  --  " added Terisa , remembering the strange conflict she had seen in the Prince 's face . Master Barsonage looked back and forth between them . Geradenknotted his fists as if to control an irrational hope . Terisa started to say something about Elega and Margonal , then stopped because she heard voices at the door . Someone  --  Ribuld ?  --  guffawed at an unexpected joke . Without knocking , Artagel swung the door open and entered the room . He was grinning ; his eyes flashed steel fire . If there had n't been a thin sheen of sweat on his forehead , or a slight pallor of old pain in his cheeks , or a barely discernible hitch in his stride , he would have looked ready and able to carry the whole castle on his shoulders into battle . He was primed for action , packed full of necessity by long days of recuperation , by emotional stresses he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as she saw him , Terisa knew that he would n't hesitate to tackle an entire platoon of Gart 's Apts . The mere sight of him did her good . And it scared her . It reminded her that if eagerness went too far it could become a form of suicide . For some reason , she noticed that the sunlight slanting in through her windows was tinged with red , approaching dusk . Leaving the door for Ribuld to close , Artagel approached Geraden . Geraden surged upright , and Artagel clasped him in a hugp433which gave no sign of weakness or injury . Then Artagel came to Terisa and dropped to his knees , actually dropped to his knees , in order to capture both her hands and kiss them . Before she could protest or respond , however , he retreated to his feet again , glared at the empty wine decanter , humorously muttered a soldier 's obscenity , then dropped himself half-sprawling into the nearest chair . " Mirrors preserve us , " he drawled in a joking tone . " Seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think I can do much more of this dance between hope and despair . First you 're gone forever . Then you show up  --  with Prince Kragen , may his skull ache for the rest of his life . Then he provokes a fight with King Joyse , and Gart appears , and the King disappears , and you 're abducted "  --  he indicatedTerisa  --  " and you "  --  Geraden  --  " run off with the mediator . Then the Tor tries to make an alliance with Prince Kragen , and it looks like the only reason that is n't going to work is because I hit him . And suddenly you both come back , and everything starts to go right , and I do n't care what that pig-brained Alend decides to do about it . I do n't even care where King Joyse is . I 'm sure it 'll all make sense eventually . " Incidentally , I have n't exactly been cautious in the things I 've said to keep people from worrying . " By worrying he obviously meant questioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the idea of translations into Orison . Terrible Imagery , monsters , fire , a few hundred thousand Cadwals  --  that kind of thing . " He faced Terisa frankly . " I 've been telling everybody you can solve that problem . I 've been saying you can shift Eremis ' mirrors so they wo n't translate here . If that 's not true , you might want to keep it to yourself . " Shift Eremis ' mirrors , Terisa thought while her stomach twisted . Oh , shit . " Just tell me one thing . " Artagel hauled himself erect , nearly laughing . " What in the name of sanity is going on here ? " " I 'll be glad to explain it , " Geraden replied , grinning like his brother 's reflection . " All you have to do is shut up . " With a gleam of joy , Artagel collapsed back into his sprawed posture . At once , however , he jerked his spine straight , squared his shoulders . " No , " he said , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat and pallor . " Tell me what happened at home . You said Houseldon was destroyed . " Geraden made a warding gesture , warning his brother back from an explosion.
