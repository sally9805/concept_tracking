In short , " Modern Masks " outlines a main chapter in a big story . Susan Lubowsky , director of the Whitney branch museum , has assembled around 60 works , all of them sculptures ; a comprehensive treatment of the subject would also consider the barrage of masks and masklike images in contemporary painting . Young artists like Rodney Alan Greenblat are placed alongside established figures like Saul Steinberg . Partly because of what may be an inherent ambiguity within the subject , the show is disquieting . On the one hand , a mask disguises and protects the self . On the other hand , it can either liberate or even become the self : In William Golding ' s " Lord of the Flies , " the more the children on the desert island paint themselves like warriors , the more they became what they are. // Much of what we identify with masks is represented here . Some of Daisy Youngblood ' s unglazed ceramic sculptures suggest the masks of the Kabuki theater . A number of works , including Terry Rosenberg ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mask , " bring to mind tribal masks in the " Primitivism " show currently at the Museum of Modern Art . The link between aggression and vulnerability is almost explicit in the large , sagging metal and wood heads of Craig Coleman , which seem like shields ; the link is implicit in the zippered heads of Nancy Grossman , whose aggressive appearance seems to conceal a personal void. // Even when masks are playful , there is often an edge to them - an edge that makes them a natural subject for an East Village artist like Greenblat , whose optimistic , " naive " imagery invariably masks defiance and cunning . His " Ancient Mask " suggests the tension between fun and provocation that is characteristic of a good deal of rock music . There is also a disturbing sense of play in the figure by David Finn - with its friendly painted cardboard head and its abject body made up of assembled detritus . Joseph Schactman also builds on a sense of trust , using the imagery of dogs , but his papier-mache dog heads , muzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wolves champing at the bit. // It would be hard to imagine a theme show that sends out more conflicting signals . There are also glazed ceramic portrait heads by Robert Arneson , one of which makes Francis Bacon look like the Medusa . And there is more intimate work by Marisol and by Susan Rothenberg , whose brass and copper wire sculpture reminds us that her floating heads are masks , too . All these heads sit there in orderly rows , like students in a classroom , only the classroom seems like a jungle in which everyone , including us , swings back and forth between a grin and a grimace. // // // Also of interest this week : <> <> " S. W. Hayter and Atelier 17 " ( Foxworth Gallery , 33 East 65th Street ) : Stanley William Hayter is a prominent and perhaps a major figure in 20th-century art . A painter and an exceptionally gifted intaglio printmaker , the 83-year-old Englishman is best known as the founder of Atelier 17 , probably the most influential of all 20th-century printmaking studios . Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950 in New York , then again in Paris after 1950 , Atelier 17 has been a place where 20th-century artists have gone in search of a method that would enable them to liberate their hand from the stern supervision of eye and mind. // This exhibition of around 40 works , organized by Ira Genstein , a private collector , can serve as an introduction to Hayter ' s achievement . All the prints were made in Atelier 17 ; the majority were made during its decade in New York . There are works by Joan Miro , Yves Tanguy , Max Ernst , Alberto Giacometti , Pablo Picasso , Alexander Calder and Jacques Lipchitz . The best work is by Hayter himself . The most instructive object is one of Hayter ' s 1954 copper plates . With its deeply bitten lines and its gnarled shapes that seem almost to have been ripped out of the stone , we are given a key to the linear energy , sculptural form and technical conviction that have made Hayter such a prominent figure . ( Through Jan. 31. ) // Gene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : This exhibition spans the last 20 years of the career of the abstract painter Gene Davis . The centerpiece is a work composed of 51 individual vertical canvases , each one with multiple stripes , which occupies an entire wall of the gallery . The strength of the show is the way it clarifies the particular eccentricity that distinguishes Davis from Kenneth Noland , Ellsworth Kelly and Brice Marden , to name three other artists for whom stripes have been an important motif. // Davis continues to move in what is ultimately an antiformalist direction . His rows of stripes are not seamlessly or classically balanced . Instead , they are members of the Rockettes in a rebellious or perverse mood . The stripes jump in and out of the pictorial surface . Two or three verticals in blue dress will jump out of line , then two or three greens will follow ; in the more recent work , a group of verticals dressed in black will take one giant step forward . This irregularity makes the surface come alive , but it also creates pictorial problems from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain in single file , would stay clear . It is this willingness to follow an open- ended path that has no sure destination , however , that gives Davis ' s work much of its identity and interest . ( Through tomorrow. ) // Gretna Campbell ( Ingber Gallery , 460 West Broadway ) : In her recent landscape paintings , Gretna Campbell has increasing control over the complex elements in her work . Her foregrounds are often fields of grass and flowers painted with an exuberant , impressionistic touch . The trees , stones and houses in the middleground and background are flatter , more blocklike , more shadowy . The exuberance and energy seem to flow easily into stillness , the three dimensions into two dimensions , the impulsiveness into privacy . In this fluid pictorial world , it is not surprising that the part of the painting to which everything seems to aspire is often a body of water. // In " Rocks in the Woods , " which stands out from the other works because of its closed setting and darker color , there is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like some of Cezanne ' s late works , the paint is bluish and the leaves and stones seem to be quaking and translucent . But the trees in the background , like trees in Mondrian ' s figurative paintings , are majestic and absolutely still . These are the kinds of works in which the possibilities of landscape painting are abundantly clear . ( Through Jan. 6. ) // Stephen Mueller ( Annina Nosei Gallery , 100 Prince Street ) : In these ambitious abstract paintings , Stephen Mueller takes elements from the whole history of Expressionist painting and tries to reshape and reassemble them from scratch . His works bring to mind the textures of Gustave Moreau , the caves of light of J. M. W. Turner , the pictorial structures of Robert Motherwell , the stains of Helen Frankenthaler and the gaudy impasto of Peter Dean . To this inclusive approach , Mueller has added his own glaze and metallic powder that makes paint glimmer and resemble caked mud . And the compositional weight seems to hang from the top of the paintings like garlands or bats. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these elements , where they should go , and how they can be made to work together , but also tries to involve us in the decision-making process . There is always something to hold our attention . In a painting like " Big Mirror , " the associations with caves and landscapes are rich enough and the composition powerful enough that we want to follow him , not just into this show , but into the next one as well .
