WRITE , FISH &; ENJOY SHAKESPEARE . <P> There the headline is , back in the classified section of the Atlantic Monthly , along with those two-line ads for items like " Cookie Beef Stew " and pleas for companionship from " caring " bachelors who love long walks and Mantovani . Under the headline is a fat , two-column come-on from the Bear Creek Corp . In Medford , Ore . In the country round Medford , it declares , " trees outnumber people . " The place is " 15 minutes from Ashland ( home of the summer Shakespearean Festival ) in the valley of the Rogue River , beloved by demented steelhead and salmon anglers . Excellent skiing , hiking , boating and swimming at your back door . " The Bear Creek people need someone to wax poetic in prose about things they sell . Writers are invited to send in and tell about their qualifications . <P> The Eastern householder and father thinks of his rarely used fly rod and his 13-year-old son . Maybe the boy will yet grow up with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Englanders : liberals in politics , but personally conservative . He has heard they can still leave their cars and houses unlocked . Now he finds himself remembering that the battery has twice been stolen out of his car , in his own garage on his own street . And recalling a recent New York headline : CITY READY TO UNLEASH SUBWAY DOG PATROL ! So he heads west with his son to explore . It is June . <P> From the air Medford at first looks fairly familiar , a blacktop and stucco fantasia of gas stations and fast-fooderies sprawling out along a meandering , not-too-clean creek . But the mountains that rim the valley are tipped with snow and trimmed with dark firs that wipe the skyline like distant eyelashes . " Gee , Dad , " the boy says , nose pressed to the window , " could we really move out here ? " <P> The Bear Creek Corp . turns out to be a kind of down-home conglomerate . It owns several companies , including the Fruit-of-the-Month Club and Jackson &; Perkins , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roses , various fancy foods and dwarf pines are sold by mail order all over the world . The ENJOY SHAKESPEARE ad was dreamed up by a celebrated fisherman named David Bascom , John Holmes , Bear Creek 's president , and Vice President David Stump , an escapee from Orange County , Calif . The job offered is for Bear Creek 's in-house advertising agency . " When we set up the agency back in 1961 , " says Stump , " we had to keep it down in Newport Beach , Calif . We simply could n't get anybody creative to come up here . " Tunes have changed . The ad brought answers from all over . Deans of colleges . Poets . Newspaper editors . East Coast ad-agency directors . A philosophy major now teaching history . The creative director of a national rock-music corporation .
