To the Editors : <P> Congratulations on presenting a glimpse of the darker side of the exploitation of the Rocky Mountain high Dec. 15 . Too many folks out here have the blindly optimistic notion that all this " progress " is a wonderful thing . Actually we are exchanging our wilderness , our water , our heritage and our very special way of life for a bunch of money that is bound to dry up when our minerals give out . Not much of a bargain , in my eyes . <P> Gregg Sutherland <P> Casper , Wyo . <P> The destruction of the natural beauty of the Rocky Mountain states in order to provide the nation with a few years ' supply of oil is like a bum burning a Renoir for a few minutes of fire . <P> Lee Salas <P> DeKalb , Ill . <P> Several years ago , I engaged in a long and bitter battle to kick the proposed 1976 Winter Olympics out of Evergreen and , eventually , out of Colorado . We feared that the environmental impact would be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Colorado has had it . Between the sagebrush rebellion and the oil companies , the once beautiful national forests and other public lands here will soon be parceled out to the highest bidder . <P> Boyd Norton <P> Evergreen , Colo . <P> The beautiful mountain identified in the picture as Grand Teton Mountain is really Mount Moran , as those , like myself , who have loved and climbed them both will recognize . <P> Robert D. Welch <P> St. Clair Shores , Mich . <P> Remembering Lennon <P> For the first time in my life I feel old . When I was growing up in the ' 60s , the Beatles represented all the excitement , hopes and dreams of my generation . The future was boundless ; it could only get better and better ; and no words can recapture the feeling of being alive in that time . Now , with the death of John Lennon Dec. 22 , I feel that the spirit of the ' 60s is over . <P> Ron Eckert <P> Ardmore , Pa . <P> With no problem at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my youth and that of hundreds of thousands of people my age . <P> Abby Norling <P> Skowhegan , Me . <P> I had very few idols ; now I have even fewer . Losing Lennon is like losing a member of my family . <P> Art Halperin <P> Hartsdale , N. Y. <P> " All you need is love " - but a gun for your protection is also useful . Shame on you , America , shame on you ! <P> Graham Morison <P> Paisley , Scotland <P> TV Boycott <P> Why should the Rev. John Hurt Dec. 15 force on me his opinion of what television America should watch ? I enjoy Dallas , Soap and the other " immoral " programs , and I do n't feel I have been adversely affected by them . Mr. Hurt does not have to watch these programs if he feels they are immoral ; or has he forgotten that there is an Off switch ? <P> Kevin Lee Sutter <P> Blacksburg , Va . <P> Although I am not a card-carrying " clean up TV " member , I am struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would appear that the networks believe they have a unilateral and inalienable right to use any material they choose to their economic advantage . If , however , another group with a differing opinion chooses to use the free-enterprise mechanism to express itself , its course of action is construed to be censorship . <P> Lowell J.
