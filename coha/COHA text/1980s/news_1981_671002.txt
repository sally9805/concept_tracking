Black Americans have more faith in government but less faith in politicians than whites have , and they remain liberal and Democratic as whites become more conservative and more Republican. // The black liberalism , however , is concentrated on economic matters and does not carry over to other ideological battlegrounds , such as the issues of abortion or prayer in schools. // These conclusions emerge from an examination of five years of New York Times/CBS News Polls and from interviews with leading authorities on black public opinion. // There are some major , immediate differences of opinion between the races on the Reagan Administration in particular and on the nation ' s prospects over the next five years in general . Whites are much happier than blacks on both counts . Blacks also favor domestic spending , especially to help the poor , while President Reagan and whites generally favor cutting it. // // Widening of Gap Is Not Clear // On most issues there is no clear evidence in the polls that the gap between the opinions of the races is widening . But Robert M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leading Republican polling organization , said that he believed the gap was widening. // " Blacks appear to be more polarized from whites than they were , and not only politically , " he said in an interview describing his poll findings. // In Times-CBS News Polls , the shift to the right in white thinking is shown by an increase in Republican allegiance among whites from 21 percent in 1977 to 29 percent in 1981 and by an increase in the percentage of whites who call themselves conservative to 36 this year from 30 in 1977. // Meanwhile , black political allegiances were more stable . In 1977 , 7 percent of blacks said they were Republicans . This year 8 percent did . Twenty-nine percent called themselves conservative four years ago and 29 percent do so now. // These self-definitions are not precise compasses pointing to likely attitudes on more specific questions . Many people call themselves conservative because of life style , not politics . But these self-descriptions seem strongly connected to opinions on issues involving government and the economy . <> <> Responses in Polls Combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computed by combining the responses of all blacks and all whites interviewed in Times/CBS News Polls in a given year , a technique that greatly reduces the range of sampling error . It is possible only when the identical question is asked over and over . In the typical Times/CBS News Poll , a difference of 10 or more percentage points between black and white responses would have to be found in most cases before sampling error could be discounted as a possible contributor to the variance. // On attitudes toward government , many of the differences are large . Some are topical . In June three-fourths of the blacks but only half as many whites said they thought they would be hurt personally by President Reagan ' s budget cuts . But other differentiations are general . In that same June poll , two-fifths of blacks interviewed said the Federal Government was more efficient than state or local authorities , but only one-fifth of whites gave that response. // That confidence in Washington is a logical result of their having " relied so much on the Federal sector , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard Medical School . Even so , he said , it is anything but an absolute faith , tempered as it is by a distrust of " politicians that reflects black experience. " // For example , a poll taken in June 1978 asked what level of government wasted more money . Sixty-five percent of the whites cited the Federal Government , as against 45 percent of the blacks . <> <> Enthusiasm for Federal Programs // Over many years , blacks have remained more enthusiastic than whites about existing or proposed Federal programs , including loans to New York City , national health insurance and most existing domestic programs , especially those intended to help the poor. // The percentage of blacks saying they felt the Government social programs of the 1960 ' s were generally helpful increased to 51 in November 1980 from 40 in June 1978 . White approval of the same efforts stayed level , at about 30 percent. // M. Carl Holman , president of the National Urban Coalition , said in an interview , " It ' s quite clear that blacks are continuing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Included among these was the Federal Government , not only because of the help it provided over the past half century , he said , but because " If blacks are weaker at the Federal level now than they were , they are infinitely weaker in most state capitals and county seats. " // But , as Dr. Poussaint noted , that greater faith in Government does not extend to faith in the politicians who do the governing . Even though they had a higher opinion of President Carter than did whites , more blacks than whites disbelieved the reasons , based on foreign policy , that he expressed for not campaigning or debating in early 1980 . They said the reason was politics . <> <> ' Bad Job ' by Officeholders // In September 1978 , a CBS News Poll recorded that two-thirds of blacks but just half of whites believed that elected officials " do a bad job . " Three blacks in four as against three whites in five said they believed politicians were less trustworthy than other people . In February 1980 , after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 10 but only two whites in 10 said they believed their Congressman would take a bribe. // That suspicious tone may explain why blacks have often been less ready to believe government pronouncements than whites have . Last June , 60 percent of whites but only 35 percent of blacks said they believed that the Social Security System was running short of money. // That warning had come from President Reagan , whom blacks oppose strongly in polls . But it was not a unique indication of skepticism about official pronouncements . Blacks were often less credulous than were whites in recent years when asked if they thought the oil shortage was real. // Blacks , however , are uncertain allies of liberals on some other important kinds of issues . <> <> Life-Style Conservatism // Julian Bond , a widely traveled State Senator from Atlanta , said he had always felt that " black Americans , on so-called life-style issues , were more conservative than whites. " // The polling data does not make exactly that point but it shows a blurry picture on these issues and certainly one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On prayer in schools , for example , 77 percent of whites and 78 percent of blacks said in April 1981 that they favored a constitutional amendment to allow such prayers. // On abortion , blacks have sometimes been less ready than whites to accept the proposition that the issue should be left to a woman and her doctor . But at other times there have been no significant differences between the races ' attitudes . It appears that the gap on this issue may be narrowing . But when the question has been phrased in terms that relate abortion to the needs of " poor women , " blacks have been much more supportive of abortion and government financing of it than have whites. // Mr. Holman said that black opposition to abortion , which , he acknowledged , may be eroding , could be explained in that " a much larger proportion of blacks are religious than whites , and religious in the old-fashioned sense of cherishing life . " The Times/CBS Polls offer some support for that analysis . Last April blacks reported more frequent church attendance than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the blacks interviewed said they listened to religious broadcasts frequently , compared with 26 percent of all whites and 46 percent of white Protestants who called themselves born-again Christians . <> <> Direct Involvement of Race // Perhaps the most obvious series of differences develop when race is directly involved in the question . Busing is one such subject , and the differences between races have remained wide for many years . On questions about progress in dealing with discrimination and on the obligation of government to take specific steps to end it , the racial differences have been both predictable and distinct. // Probably no racially related question has produced a disparity as striking as that resulting from the question of whether higher levels of black unemployment have been caused mainly by unwillingness of blacks to work . In April 1981 , 43 percent of whites said it was , and only 7 percent of blacks did. // On issues that relate to the poor , even if the question has no direct racial reference , the pattern of results is similar . In November 1980 , 54 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need the help . Only half as many blacks did. // Foreign policy issues have generally produced less dramatic differences . But blacks were less willing than whites to see the country take actions that would involve it directly in crises in Afghanistan , Poland and Iran . They were also less likely than whites to say , after the fact , that strong action earlier would have brought a quicker release for the hostages held in the American Embassy in Teheran. // Finally , there is an apparent deep black skepticism about many widely held opinions that seem almost standard with some elements of white American society . For example , in July 1979 , whites divided almost evenly on whether the moon walk a decade earlier had been worth it . On a more mundane level in the same poll , whites split evenly on whether youth should study specifically for high-paying jobs or pursue what interested them academically . By 3-to-1 margins , blacks rejected the moon walk and preferred training for high pay. //              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
