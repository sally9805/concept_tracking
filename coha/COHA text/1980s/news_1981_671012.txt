" I get the same excitement from acting that I used to get from mathematics , " he said the other day at a restaurant near his midtown Manhattan apartment . " In math , the excitement comes when a logical order of steps brings you to an answer . As an actor , you say , ' Aha , now I see how this character at the beginning of the play got to be this character at the end of the play. ' " // In his highly praised performance as Prince Hal in the New York Shakespeare Festival ' s " Henry IV , Part 1 , " which has been extended at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park through Sept. 6 , Mr. Vickery convincingly shows how Prince Hal ' s character can change midway in the play. // The Prince , heir apparent to the throne of England , appears at the beginning of the play as a dissolute tavern lout and companion to Sir John Falstaff , a hard-drinking soldier who reigns with sharp wit in the tavern underworld . By play ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a martial leader , skilled enough as a warrior to kill the kingdom ' s most fearsome rebel in hand-to-hand combat and dispassionate enough to tell his old friend Falstaff before battle , " Thou owest God a death. " // " More than most actors I have seen in the role , Mr. Vickery makes it clear that Hal ' s quick maturing is deeply imbedded in his character , " wrote Mel Gussow , reviewing the production in The New York Times and calling him " a gifted young actor with all the attributes necessary to play Shakespeare . " <> <> Math Whiz to Actor // How Mr. Vickery transformed himself from a high school math whiz into an accomplished 30-year-old Shakespearean actor is something of a problem in itself . While he remembers having always been in love with numbers , he dates his love for the stage from a day at high school in Alameda , Calif. , where he grew up . He was suddenly drafted to play Sir Toby Belch in Shakespeare ' s " Twelfth Night. " // " I hadn ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was a skinny kid with pillows stuffed down his trousers . But the first time I walked out on stage in front of an audience , I just said , ' This is the greatest thing in the world. ' " // It was several years , though , before he thought of acting as a career . He appeared in numerous college productions at Berkeley , but when he graduated , he set out to roam in Europe for a year . Eventually , he settled in Paris. // " It was the nadir of my life , " Mr. Vickery recalled . " Paris , 1971 . Broke . A string of stupid jobs . A tortured love affair . I was getting nowhere . I asked myself : ' What do I know how to do ? ' I had done plays in college , and it was really what I liked to do . So , I decided to be an actor. " // He returned to the United States and enrolled at the University of California at Davis , where he acted mostly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he moved to San Francisco and became more deeply involved in experimental theater , even writing three plays. // By 1979 , Mr. Vickery was rapidly establishing a solid career . But he began to feel that his training as an actor was lacking something essential . " I had a natural ability for getting under the skin of a character , " Mr. Vickery said . " But I wanted to learn , in a very technical sense , what was the best way of presenting that character on stage . I wanted some veneer training . " <> <> Inside Out and Outside In // So , he went back to Europe , this time to the Drama Studio in London . For a year he studied phonetic alphabets , stage movement and the physical structure of bones and vocal cords . By the time he graduated , he had found a personal technique for developing characters , which he describes as a mixture of " the American approach , which is working from the inside out , and the English approach , which is working from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " Henry IV , Part 1 . " Starting from the " outside in , " he wrote out all of Prince Hal ' s speeches in a phonetic alphabet . Studying the phonetic patterns of Shakespeare ' s writing , Mr. Vickery said , often reveals dramatic devices that affect audiences at an unconscious level. // One example comes from a speech in which Prince Hal swears to his father that he will end his wanton ways and redeem himself by killing the rebel leader , Hotspur . " The last line of the king ' s speech is , ' To show how much thou art degenerate , ' and the first one of mine is , ' Do not think so , ' " Mr. Vickery said . " Simply emphasizing that ' duh ' sound of ' Do not think so ' gives the attack that Prince Hal needs at the beginning of the speech . It grabs the ear and involves the audience in the character , probably at an unconscious level. " // The next step was to study Prince Hal from the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic work on political leadership , " The Prince . " <> <> A Machiavellian Approach // " A lot of productions have Prince Hal hanging around in the tavern at the beginning , having a great time , " he explained . " Suddenly , for no apparent reason , he becomes somber , as if he was thinking , ' Oh , what a drag , I have to go to war. ' " // From reading " The Prince " and from a close study of Shakespeare ' s script , Mr. Vickery concluded that there was a good reason for Prince Hal ' s sudden emergence as a leader . " Prince Hal is a very ambitious young man from the very start , " he said . " He ' s exploring that underworld in a very calculated way . Falstaff represents the forces of anarchy and chaos , and those are the forces that he is going to have to control when he becomes king. " // With that , Mr. Vickery grinned . " Sounds a bit academic , doesn ' t it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . " Academic or not , Mr. Vickery ' s methods have worked well for him . After returning from the Drama Studio in 1980 , he played the title role in " Pericles " and Dr. Caius in " The Merry Wives of Windsor " at the Berkeley Shakespeare Festival , winning a San Francisco Drama Critics Circle award for each performance. // Since his arrival in New York eight months ago , Mr. Vickery has followed those triumphs with critically praised performances in a Lincoln Center production of " Macbeth " and now the Shakespeare Festival ' s " Henry. " // " Doing Shakespeare is very fulfilling , " he said . " You have to go with everything you ' ve got , all at once . Your brain , your heart , your guts , your pharynx , your fibula . Still , you never feel like you ' re doing enough . You never feel like you ' ve got it. " //
