 | Well , bag your face and gag me with a spoon , fer sure . Grody old grownups may have missed it , like TOTALLY , but a bitchen new single from southern California has been riding the airwaves to the max this summer , providing parody-rocker Frank Zappa with his first mainstream hit and , more to the point , inspiring adolescents around the country to adopt a bizarre new kind of slang . Called " Valley Girl , " the record spoofs the life-style and lingo of the trend-obsessed teen-age girls of Los Angeles 's San Fernando Valley suburbs , otherwise known as " Vals . " The key to the song 's impact is n't the music , but rather a monologue arrestingly squealed by Zappa 's 14-year-old daughter , Moon , in prototypical Val-speak . To use the Valley vernacular , it looks , y'know , like a TUBULAR biggie , not only in L.A. and New York , but in Chicago , Detroit and Atlanta . As depicted on the Zappa disc , Vals are basically bubble-headed -- but harmless ? young shopping molls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg wax . " Last idea to cross her mind/Had something to do with where to find/A pair of jeans to fit her butt/And where to get her toenails cut , " sings Zappa , who previously led the satirical Mothers of Invention rock group . Papa Zappa never had an AM radio hit until he capitalized on his offspring 's own inventiveness : daughter Moon 's dinner table imitations of her Val schoolmates were so funny that he asked her to improvise a five-minute rap in the recording studio . The result was a word-perfect portrait of the ultimate Valley girl . Portraying a Val called Andrea ( pronounced " Ondrya " ) , Moon chatters on in an adenoidal whine , complaining about her mother ( " like a total space cadet " ) , her braces ( " like a total bum- mer " ) and her homosexual English teacher ( " he like flirts with all the guys in the class ... It 's like BARF ME OUT " ) . Few Vals seem offended by Moon 's wicked send-up of their mores and manners . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get a lot of attention , " giggles 14-year-old Loryn Laughlin , adding that in a recent vacation in Europe she was deluged with requests for Val-talk lessons . " People get excited when they find out where I 'm from . They say , You 're from the Valley ? Say something like barf-out ' . " Togged out in her trendiest mini , white flats and white bow tie ( " It 's the latest " ) , Loryn makes regular pilgrimages with her friends to what the song accurately identifies as the Val mecca ? the Galleria shopping complex in Encino . Such conscientious consumerism has made Vals like Loryn enormously popular among merchants . John Green , proprietor of the Galleria 's Village Mews clothing store , finds Valley girls refreshingly unaffected ? and reliable . " I 'll take a V al 's check any day , " he says . " You know they 'll never bounce , because these girls take their shopping seriously . " There seems little question that the Val phenomenon ranks right up there with Deely Bobbers and Chipwiches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single is currently the most requested song at station KFRC in San Francisco , WLUP in Chicago and WLIR in Hempstead , N.Y. , and the album on which it appears jumped 101 rungs two weeks ago to number 71 on Billboard magazine 's pop charts . Already the usual spin-offs are whirling into stores : Val posters , beach towels , bumper stickers and T shirts ? even a " Valley Dudes " record . Why all the interest ? " Vals are everywhere , not just in California , " says Moon Zappa . " They might not be called Vals , but they act just like Valley girls and people recognize them . " Wherever teen-age girls cruise the shopping malls , lusting after the latest look , there is the true Val . It 's like totally awesome , fer sherrrr ! @#
