No matter what restaurant you choose , you are likely to find other Zagateers there when you arrive . More than 100 , 000 copies of the 1988 guide are in circulation , along with some 300 , 000 from previous years. // Mug a Wall Street lawyer and you are likely to find one in his briefcase . Ask your Big Eight accountant for a recommendation about where to take an out-of-town visitor and she might pull a copy out of the center drawer of her desk . Like Santa Claus , Zagat is everywhere these days , at least among the Big Apple ' s corporate cognescenti. // " I have three or four copies : one at home , one at the office , another that I carry with me , " said Michael L. Ainslie , president of Sotheby ' s Inc. , the art auction house . <> <> For Insiders , Too // Even such insiders as Walter B. Wriston , former chairman of Citicorp , relies on Zagat to help him find just the right plate to put before guests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said last week . " You need something. " // The book ' s popularity in the business world has made it one of the hottest new guidebooks of the decade . In less than five years , it has grown from a mimeographed sheet , handed out annually to a few dozen friends of its founders , Eugene H. Zagat Jr. and his wife , Nina S. Zagat , to a $1 million business . Next year , business could double if early sales of the new edition are any indication . Circulation should pass 150 , 000 this year , up from 40 , 000 in 1985 and 7 , 500 in its first year , 1983. // The original book inspired the Zagats to produce knock-offs in Los Angeles , Boston , Washington , San Francisco , Chicago and New Orleans . More are on the way , and a nationwide hotel survey is in the works .

The Zagat surveys are self-published and distributed , with virtually no marketing effort applied to selling the books until this year . <> <> A Blow Against Tyranny // The independent aura constitutes much of the appeal of the books . As a whole , the Zagat series amounts to a revolt againt the tyranny of critics , the handful of paid professionals whose recommendations and analyses have traditionally guided diners , theater goers and travelers to their destinations . Critics - many of whom publish their reviews in book form - carry an air of royalty about them , freely passing judgment on those they choose to examine. // The Zagat surveys take a more republican aproach . They sample the opinions of thousands of relatively well-off consumers. // All an aspiring critic has to do is to write to Zagat and request a survey form . Being asked for , rather than told , an opinion of a restaurant brings participants back year after year .

' " And Zagat says of one of the best-known French restaurants , La Grenouille , " It ' s one of the best places for serious celebration - birthday , anniversary or first million. " // The only payment that the survey participants receive is a copy of the next guide . <> <> Born in Paris // The Zagats developed the idea while living in France in the 1960 ' s . Both held well-paying jobs as Paris-based associates for New York law firms . Like many temporary residents of Paris , the diversity and flavor of French cooking surprised and enchanted them. // " Up to that point , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , " Mr. Zagat said last week . Though they followed the standard guidebooks , they also took great delight in comparing notes with American friends and associates . By the time they left France in 1969 , they had devised their own rating system , based solely on the opinions of those willing to offer them their comments. // They returned to a New York just emerging from the Dark Ages of dining . Prune danish were gradually giving way to croissants and martinis to an infinite variety of seltzers . New cuisines were appearing almost every week . To help their growing circle of friends keep up with the latest in gustatory experiences in Manhattan , they created a New York version of their Paris survey. // By 1982 , the Zagats were spending thousands of dollars to print and distribute questionnaires to several hundred participants , then spending more time and money compiling the results .

The big break came the next year when Pete Gogolak , the former New York Giants place kicker , asked the Zagats if they could prepare a deluxe edition of the book with the name of his employer , Charles P. Young , a financial printer , stamped in gold on the cover. // Mr. Gogolak bought 4 , 000 copies to distribute to customers and suppliers . Volume soared as other companies mimicked the Gogolak idea. // Mr. Zagat , a 47-year-old native New Yorker resigned from his job as an in-house lawyer for Gulf &; Western two years ago to run the survey business . He opened an office in an aging building on 45th Street off the Avenue of the Americas , overlooking the back of a parking garage .

They can already tell that the Quilted Giraffe in Manhattanis is sticking its neck out by charging $78 for a typical dinner . That is at least 15 percent more than any other fancy restaurant in the survey. // Their 3 , 500 respondents eat out an average of 3. 6 times a week , or 187 times a year . That means the survey is based on 650 , 000 meals . As a result , the Zagats can tell which restaurants are drawing the customers and which aren ' t . " That could be useful information if you were looking for a bargain in restaurant equipment , " Mr. Zagat said. //
