The man never emerges from behind the camera , but every frame tells you who directed The Milagro Beanfield War . This movie even looks like Robert Redford : it 's smart and handsome , with a crinkly smile around the edges . It boasts wistful vistas and umber landscapes . Clouds stampede over the northern New Mexico terrain , where hillocks perch like adobe huts . The kiss of two fine brown faces is silhouetted by an orange sunset , flaring into sympathetic melodrama . Night falls , and there 's a rope of rainbow in the sky ; a frosted moon smiles behind a scrim of mist . It makes for quite a pretty show . Nature has rarely gone to the movies in starker , more glamorous clothes . <P> The film thinks like Redford too : its passionate humanism is laced with wry . For Redford is not only Hollywood 's last hero . He is a benevolent movie mogul , using his Sundance Institute to finance noble independent films in the pastoral mode . Alas , most of these films have been lame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show the young directors at Sundance that a well-meaning film can also be a good movie . <P> Working from John Nichols ' 1974 novel , he has fashioned the imaginary town of Milagro ( Spanish for miracle ) into a Disneyland with dirt . See the picturesque shacks , the decent people with their ready aphorisms , the general store that sells everything from bullets to Paul Newman 's salad dressing . On this sere turf , Hispanics have lived and farmed , have scratched out survival for centuries . And they do n't need the white folks ' help , muchas gracias . As the town 's mayor tells a visiting sociologist ( Daniel Stern ) , " If we do n't know it already , chances are we are n't interested in learning it . " <P> His remark applies both to the Milagrans and to the rich Anglos nearby who have plans to turn the area into a resort , complete with ski lodge , golf course , condominiums and a man-made lake . The developers are not interested in the resort 's effect on Milagro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mondragon ( Chick Vennera ) though . On a caprice , Joe has irrigated his parched beanfield with water destined for the resort , and now the land barons are flexed to strike back . <P> These scenes carry hints that Redford wants to update some classic movie parables . Milagro could be Chinatown , with its diverted water supply and political-industrial intrigue . Or Silkwood , with a heroic loner fatally bucking the system . Or The Treasure of the Sierra Madre , with the greedy Anglos outsmarted by wily Hispanic outlaws who snort , " We do n't need no stinkin ' condos ! " <P> But this is Redfordland , and Milagro is a dream of liberal community . The developers , timid villains in a modern range war , are no match for the villagers . Here comes Ruby ( Sonia Braga ) , the local La Pasionaria , bustling with petitions and ' 60s rhetoric . Sheriff Bernie ( Ruben Blades , who exudes sly star quality ) keeps tamping down the hot tempers of the villagers and the Anglos . And Amarante ( Carlos Riquelme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ancient curses . He even fires his pistol at an intruder and drives the developers ' bulldozer over a cliff  --  though no one in this gossipy town takes any notice of it . Is this old man loco ? No , he is on the side of the angels . One angel , anyway : a venerable sprite ( Robert Carricart ) who plays the concertina , quotes Shakespeare and orchestrates the war like a seraphic Ike .
