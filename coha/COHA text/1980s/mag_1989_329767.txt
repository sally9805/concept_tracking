Fujitsu , Japan 's largest computer firm , has often come under attack in the West for its trade practices . U.S. rivals have accused Fujitsu of a lowball pricing policy that keeps foreign firms out of the Japanese market . But last week a howl of protest went up in Japan when Fujitsu tried to carry out such pricing at home . The uproar occurred after Hiroshima 's city government sought bids to design a new computer system . Seven firms offered to do the work at prices ranging from $2,000 to $201,000 . But the winner was Fujitsu , which submitted a bid of less than a penny . The practice smacked of dumping , in which goods or services are sold below cost . Fujitsu hoped to recoup its initial loss by having city officials eventually buy more expensive software and hardware . While Fujitsu has admitted to carrying out similar practices in the past , it offered to retract the latest bid . Even so , the government has pledged to investigate whether the company broke any laws .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
