When Cuban Air Force Brigadier General Rafael del Pino Diaz boarded a small Cessna 402 one afternoon last week along with his wife and three children , he apparently told Cuban airport authorities that he merely intended to take a flying jaunt around the island . Instead , he headed for Key West Naval Air Station 90 miles away . Picked up by radar , the Cessna attracted the attention of two F-16 fighters , but they allowed Del Pino to pass after clearance from the control tower . Upon landing , the general turned himself over to U.S. military and immigration officials , becoming the highest-ranking officer to defect from Cuba since Fidel Castro 's takeover 28 years ago . <P> Del Pino told Justice Department officials that he was recently appointed deputy chief of staff in the Cuban Armed Forces Ministry . Described as an " internationalist commander " in official Cuban press reports , Del Pino reportedly served as chief of air troops in Angola , where 30,000 Cuban soldiers are helping the Marxist regime battle U.S.-backed rebels . According to U.S. officials , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said a Justice Department spokesman : " He 's in a position to know pretty much anything we 'd want to find out about the Cuban military  --  and a lot of other things . " <P> Cuban authorities quickly discredited the prize defector . For most of his career , they said , Del Pino had been a lowly flight instructor . He was grounded in January for psychological stress and eyesight problems , they added , and was assigned to organize an air force museum . <P> But there seemed little doubt that Del Pino was a genuine Cuban air hero . Born 48 years ago in Pinar del Rio province , where his father owned several movie theaters , Del Pino as a teenager attended Harrison Chilhowee Baptist Academy in Seymour , Tenn. , then returned to Cuba . At 14 , he was arrested for demonstrating against Cuban President Fulgencio Batista . In the late 1950s , he joined Castro 's revolutionaries . <P> After Castro overthrew the Batista regime , Del Pino learned to fly .

He rose rapidly through the ranks and , in 1975 , became a first commander . He was trained in the Soviet Union at the Yuri Gagarin Aviation College . As of last week , however , Del Pino was anything but admired by Cuba 's Communist rulers . Characterizing his defection as " strange and treacherous conduct , " the Armed Forces Ministry said it has " irreparably stained his life , his history and his honor . "
