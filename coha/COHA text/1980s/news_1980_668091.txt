In the always-on-your-toes style that she gave to most of her nine children , and surely her four sons , Rose Kennedy plans to celebrate her 90th birthday this month with a display of Irish heartiness . On July 20 , she will treat Boston to the Rose Kennedy Walk , leading a mile-and-a-half citizens parade past some of the sites that are as cherished in her own life as they are memorable in the life of the nation . These will include the State House where her father and father- in-law were pro-labor politicians in the Senate in the 1890s ; the Bellevue Hotel , where John F. Kennedy lived during his first campaign for Congress in 1945-46 ; and Faneuil Hall , where her father , Honey Fitz , the Mayor of Boston , gave orations and where , last November , Edward became the third of her sons to seek the presidency . Aside from this reminiscing on the run , the real juice of Mrs. Kennedy ' s 90th birthday is that she is one of America ' s authentic and unwavering heroines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - father , husband and sons - she would have probably lived well within the shade of anonymity . But that is much the reason for her genuineness . The fervors to which she has given herself - instilling a sense of social justice and public service in her children , daily Mass and the practice of religion , sharing her good fortunes - are ones she would have been as committed to had her part of the Fitzgerald clan never left Ireland . You can visit quiet villages in the Irish countryside today and see 90- year-old Rose Kennedys walking to Mass every morning . Ask them what this piety means and they will answer as Mrs. Kennedy did the other day : " I have often felt that if God were to take away all His blessings and leave me with one gift , I would ask for faith , for with faith in Him , in His goodness , mercy and love , and a belief in everlasting life , I feel we can suffer every kind of temporary deficit and still triumph . " Had she been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Kennedy ' s philosophy of family life would also have been little different from what it actually has been . Once a commitment to your husband and children is made , it must remain unshakable . In the twisted values of the times , this spirit of generous devotion is dismissed as subservience . If your spouse isn ' t turning out the way you had planned and is impeding your " growth , " dump the marriage . Even more cataclysmic , if children are in the way and keeping you from law school or writing your novel , walk over them , too . To the off-our-backs contingent within modern feminism , Mrs. Kennedy would never have qualified for sisterhood , much less been seen as " fulfilled . " In truth , though , she was acting on the belief that whatever the passing strains in a marriage may be or whatever the sacrifices child-raising may call for , infinitely more is to be gained through loyalty to the ideal than impatience about the temporary reality . " To me , " Mrs. Kennedy has said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a work of art . " Before it becomes art , though , it is work . In finding both her identity and her joys in a life of service to her husband and children , Mrs. Kennedy has had little interest in doubting the worthiness of her vocation . " There have been many times in my life , " she says , " when I felt I was one of the most fortunate people in the world . And even when my life has been scarred by tragedy I have never lost this feeling that God has held all of us in His hand , giving us great joy as well as great challenges . " With husband and children dominating most of the first 70 years of her life , it was predictable that a different kind of flowering would mark the past 20 . She took up French and German , wrote an autobiography , became a dedicated walker ( three miles a day ) and took to the stump in the political campaigns of her sons . If it seems that Mrs. Kennedy is old-fashioned - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion - then once again Mrs. Kennedy is out of step . At 90 , she refuses to accept the popular put-down that to be old means to be tired . Because she has yet to sit out any other joyous , or sad , occasion in her life , her buoyant message to the country is that on entering her tenth decade she is doing no more than acting her age - but acting it fully .
