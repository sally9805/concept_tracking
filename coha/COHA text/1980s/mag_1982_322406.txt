For some 200 customers of New York 's Chemical Bank , the tedious chore of checking their balances or paying their bills no longer means standing in line at the neighborhood branch office . Instead , they simply switch on their Atari home computers , telephone a special Chemical Bank number , punch in some secret password codes and numbers into their machines and conduct all their banking business from their living rooms . <P> Chemical 's foray into bank-at-home personal computing , dubbed Pronto , was announced last week . This was the latest move by a growing number of banks to cash in on the popularity of personal computers . As prices for the machines have plunged and their use has spread , bankers have begun eyeing home computers as a huge new market and a way to cut costs and paperwork in the back office . New York 's Citibank has an experimental program in 100 homes in Queens , while the First Bank System in Minneapolis has computers with 250 customers . <P> For now , Chemical 's customers can use only Atari machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer Pronto to people who own other brands . Cost of the service : $5 to $10 a month . <P> The United American Bank in Knoxville , Tenn. , has been offering bank-at-home since January 1981 , and the United American Bank in Memphis has had the service since the start of this year . For $5 a month , customers can pay bills , inquire about interest rates or even receive a computerized news-delivery system provided by CompuServe , a Columbus information data bank . So far , about 550 customers have signed up at the two banks . <P> One question that continues to worry bankers and customers about at-home accounts is security . Computerized crime is already a menace to banks , and the dangers are multiplied many times over when access to bank computers is opened up to customers as well as employees . As a protective measure , Chemical 's Pronto customers must send three separate codes every time they want to conduct business . First Bank System in Minneapolis is testing a magnetic identification card that must be inserted into a special terminal slot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both Chemical and First Bank System claim that they have had no security problems with their pilot projects .
