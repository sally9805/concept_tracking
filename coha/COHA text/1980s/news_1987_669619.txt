So Ohori , a gangling six-footer , greets the stocky , T-shirted farmer in Tagalog . He has just pulled up at the farmer ' s concrete-block , galvanized-iron-roofed house on his trusty Honda , a journalist friend in tow. // The farmer , obviously pleased to see Mr. Ohori , invites us to sit on stools in the fresh morning air outside his house where palms sway in the breeze and bougainvillea is blooming . Beside the door hangs a painted plaque : ' ' God bless our home . ' ' His name , he says , is Martin Maklang , and he farms two hectares ( five acres ) of rice paddies . He also has four cows . One of them was artificially inseminated three weeks ago , and Ohori has come to see whether she has become pregnant. // // Ohori is a livestock technician from Tokyo who works as an ' ' overseas cooperation volunteer ' ' - Japan ' s equivalent of the Peace Corps . He has been in the Philippines since March 1986 , and is thinking of extending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end next March. // ' ' We ' re just beginning to recover from the confusion caused by ( deposed President Ferdinand ) Marcos ' s downfall , ' ' he said , ' ' and I ' d like to stay on a bit longer to help see things through. ' ' // The overseas volunteers are under the jurisdiction of the Japan International Cooperation Agency , which sends aid experts to developing countries . Japan ' s whole aid effort is now under intense scrutiny by the United States and other Western countries , which complain that Japan should be doing a lot more in this field. // Japan ' s aid is now second only to that of the US in monetary terms . Last year it stood at $5. 6 billion , and by 1990 it should be $7. 6 billion . Last week , Japan offered Southeast Asian nations a new $2 billion aid package. // But Japan ' s aid budget is only 0. 29 percent of its gross national product , less than half the United Nations target of 0. 7 percent . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the proportion of aid that is a grant rather than a loan - is considerably lower than that of other Western countries. // That said , Ohori and his fellow volunteers are an impressive example of the saying that aid is people. // Ohori is one of nearly 1 , 700 volunteers who have signed up for two-year stays in 38 countries . Ninety-four of them are in the Philippines , where they work in agriculture , health , education , processing , construction , sports , and maintenance. // Ohori ' s expertise is in animal husbandry , specifically in artificial insemination , a program that has been a feature of Japanese technical aid for 20 years . It costs a peasant 100 to 200 pesos ( $5 to $10 ) to have his cow serviced by a seed bull . Artificial insemination , a government program , is free , and over time will improve the scrawny backyard cow most peasants raise and take to market. // That ' s the theory . In fact , less than 40 percent of impregnated cows conceive . The techniques that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply at the backyard level. // This is the story of development everywhere . Ohori ' s task is to observe , to follow through , to continue with the record-keeping begun by his predecessor , and thus help improve the program ' s success rate. // As for Mr. Maklang ' s cow , 21 days have passed since insemination . The farmer brings a pail of water and a bar of soap . Ohori dons a plastic glove and gently examines the cow . His verdict : The signs are hopeful , but it may be a bit too early to tell. // Maklang has sent his son to the village store to buy colas and sweet buns for his guests . Ohori sits down with Maklang and a couple of farmers who have come to pass the time of day . They have a list of requests . Could he spay a dog ? Could he do something about an infestation of snails that is eating up their crops ? The son goes into the paddies and comes back with a couple of snails - ugly , gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohori can ' t offer much except sympathy , but the chitchat is an important part of his daily routine. // What does Maklang think about President Aquino ' s land reform program ? Well , yes , he ' s heard about it , but doesn ' t know the details . He received his paddies under President Marcos ' s land reform program . His former landlord is still rich , he says , still has about 100 hectares ( 250 acres ) , and lives in a Manila suburb. // Maklang ' s four cows , it turns out , belong to his neighbors . When they are sold , he will get a percentage of the proceeds . A few years ago , Maklang ' s oldest son went to work in Saudi Arabia . The money he sends back is an important part of the family budget . Many people in the region , Ohori says , have sons in Saudi Arabia. // Ohori ' s next client is 122 miles down the road . ' ' I could never get around all the places I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fililipino technicians with whom he works must depend on bicycles or buses . Their salaries are 600 pesos ( $300 ) per month . Ohori ' s is 6 , 000 pesos - a princely sum in the area . ' ' I felt very bad about it at first , but gradually I ' ve found useful things to do with the money I earn , ' ' he says . ' ' Of course I could easily spend it all on parties for the staff , but the problem is to find something that directly relates to the project . For instance , I help out with gasoline and other transportation costs. ' ' // Ohori joined the overseas volunteers , he say , ' ' not really out of some grand desire to help others . I wanted to test my own capacities , to see what I could do in a context outside Japan. ' ' // When he first came , he confesses , he thought he had some skills , some expertise , that he could hand on to his Filipino colleagues . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show his co-workers how he does things , and leave it up to them as to how much , or how little , they might want to absorb. // ' ' If you just bring your Japanese attitudes here - insist on starting on time every day , sticking with your task for the day until it ' s done - you aren ' t going to get anywhere , ' ' said Ohori . ' ' You will succeed only to the extent that the people you work with want whatever it is that you have . We ' re like merchants displaying our samples and saying , ' Do please take whatever you want , whatever you think will be useful to you. ' ' ' // ' ' The greatest value in ( the program ) for me , ' ' he says , ' ' are the human relationships I feel I ' ve established - the sense that we are co-workers , that we ' re all in the same boat.
