Music and nature have long held an affinity for each other . And , as summer settles in , the Orchestra , or Tanglewood , where the Boston Symphony spends July and August , this is the season when music takes to the hills. // More than any other art form , music derives an indefinable value from the open air . But how much of this value are you prepared to receive ? How can you get more ? // According to some keen musical minds , you need to bring along a perspective - a point of view about what you will hear - and a memory of what you have heard before. // ' ' People have to be prepared to respond to the immediacy , shapes , spectrum of sounds , and the silence in music , ' ' says Larry Hill , music director of the Pro Arte Chamber Orchestra in Boston . Other musicologists agree : Music is its own language , and listeners must learn how to respond to it. // There is , of course , a very basic way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just go there and let it hit you , ' ' advises Boris Goldovsky , a prominent figure in music and opera . ' ' I really think that is the best way . Music is something that by and large should have an immediate effect. ' ' // Conductor Thomas Dunn generally agrees . ' ' What you need to do , ' ' he argues , ' ' is to put down a feeling of insecurity . Like what you like ; don ' t feel bad about what you don ' t like . People listen in different ways . Some people are aware of the shapes in music . Others can ' t see or hear them . There are people who have no vocabulary to describe what they hear , but they do , in fact , hear the shapes. ' ' // Hearing the shapes . Letting it hit you . Appreciating the music ' s immediacy . These seem to be the primary elements in rewarding concert going . But many who attend concerts must feel that a lot more is going on than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this musical mass : the structure , materials , and meaning of music ? // Once you get beyond what composer Aaron Copeland calls ' ' the purely sensuous plane ' ' of music listening , you come into a maze of values and structures that requires experience and some leisure study to negotiate . Copeland ' s book , ' ' What to Listen for in Music , ' ' is one of the very best volumes on this subject ( New York : Mentor Books ) . Slender , uncomplicated , the book introduces you to the basic elements of music and explains how to begin to grapple with them. // Applying this knowledge is not always easy . ' ' I am pretty sympathetic to any listener ' s problem in going to a concert , ' ' comments composer , conductor , musicologist Gunther Schuller . ' ' It ' s hard to bring to the performance prior listening experience , to fully appreciate what is being played . . . . It ' s like asking me to go to a zoological seminar. ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond to the essence of music , people who can appreciate the icy abstractions of Schonberg as well as any musical scholar can . For these people , he says , intellectual knowledge of music is so much extra baggage. // ' ' Who am I to say they are not having as valid an experience as I am having , because I know what is going on ? ' ' Schuller asks rhetorically . However , for those who want to ' ' know what is going on ' ' ( and in most cases this means getting more out of the music ) , he lays out a blueprint for better listening : Listening a lot ; reading about composers ; and listening in an historical context. // Listen to the shapes or the themes in the music , he advises . He calls it ' ' a modest , but useful thing ' ' to ask : ' ' Is it an arching shape ? An ascending shape ? A descending shape ? ' ' To identify this shape , and then stay with it , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you listen to the shape , other things start to come out . You begin to hear counter-melodies , bass lines , the whole vertical arrangement that the composer is supporting it with. ' ' // Schuller adds that it is important to have a feeling for the personality , temperament , and era of the major musical figures . If you know what Beethoven said about the piece you are listening to , for example , you have a better perspective on the work . Numerous biographies combine excellent personal history with easy-to-grasp musical analysis. // The last step , listening in an historical context , may be the most important . ' ' You can not appreciate the immense impact of Beethoven if you are listening with ears conditioned by contemporary music , ' ' Schuller says . ' ' The dissonances in Beethoven were ear-shockers . ' ' Some musicologists suggest listening to recordings of Mozart and Haydn to prepare for a Beethoven concert . Then , one can better appreciate the awesome surprise of Beethoven ' s music. // ' ' To appreciate the enormous span and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Third Symphony ) , ' ' Schuller says , one has to listen with the ears of a 19th-century concertgoer . ' ' Nothing like that had ever happened before . ' ' The Third Symphony took its audience by storm . If you can grasp the reasons why - the incredible compression of the thing , its structural innovation - you get a more vivid picture of the composer ' s remarkable powers. // Where all of this advice leads is to a more finely honed viewpoint . The idea is not to accumulate vast stores of knowledge about the history and technical terminology of music . The idea is to get familiar with the basic elements of composing and the tortuous historical path music has taken. // Of course , all of this is meaningless if something isn ' t happening on a much deeper level between music and listener . Schuller and others say that the pride of knowledge more often comes between listener and concert than it brings them together . ' ' Bringing the score along , ' ' says Larry Hill , ' ' can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // What counts is the ability to let a direct involvement with the performance benefit from a little background knowledge . Mozart ' s G-Minor ( 40th ) Symphony is moving and powerful all by itself . But it doesn ' t hurt to know that for most of the last century it was thought of as light-hearted . It was only much later that musicians discovered the deep under-currents of grief in the work . This makes you listen harder for the emotional base of the piece , and it helps you better appreciate Mozart ' s subtlety. // Similarly , knowing that the commoners ' parts in ' ' The Magic Flute ' ' are all written in a folk-song-like , earthy idiom , while the more exalted characters are treated with a higher genre of music , gives a more illuminated vision of the work. // Understanding that much of the genius of ' ' Eroica ' ' lies in Beethoven ' s ability to release the incredible energy in the opening chord gives you a clue of where to look for the symphony ' s power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a simple technique for getting more out of music : continuity of listening. // Few people pick up a novel , read a few pages closely , and then let their mind wander while absently turning several more pages , eventually picking up the thread again , and so on . Yet this is what often happens at concerts. // When you apply the same concentration to live music that you do to printed literature , amazing things happen . Structural elements stand out . Fragments of melody meld into a flowing series of ideas . The architecture of the piece appears. // It ' s easy to be distracted by the ambiance of the places where music sprouts in summer . On the other hand , as Larry Hill points out : ' ' Listening to music involves qualities of cherishing things . That ' s why summer festivals can be so special . Active listening , creative listening , using one ' s mind and memory to appreciate the live quality of the experience. // ' ' What you ' re really doing is cherishing music and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
