 | Perhaps the single greatest moment in the history of stadium organ-playing occurred seven years ago in Chicago , when a streaker dashed across the Comiskey Park outfield and Nancy Faust , the mistress of the White Sox 's keyboard , launched into a rendition of " Is That All There Is ? " Since then , Faust , 34 , has won a gold record from Mercury for reviving sales of " Kiss Him Goodbye ( Na Na Hey Hey ) , " a rock chant now sung at stadiums nationwide ? and her counterpart on the Pittsburgh Pirates , Vince Lascheid , has achieved the distinc20 organists convened to consider such topics as the use of beer jingles , coping with the electronic scoreboard and canned music . " These people are the Greek chorus of the game , " Freeman proclaimed as he introduced a panel consisting of Faust , Lascheid , Redwings organist Fred Costello and Terry Cashman , composer of a tune called " Talkin ' Baseball . " Although not himself an organist , Cashman believes that " baseball is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tion of being the first musician threatened with ejection by an umpire for perpetrating " wise-guy chords . " But for all that , the status of the stadium organist has remained stagnant . Indeed , Lascheid a man witty enough to herald shortstop Dave Concepcion with a few bars of " I Get Ideas " ? now works mainly at a suburban surf-and-turf restaurant for the simple reason that pianobar jobs pay more . " There 's no question that stadium organists are too little appreciated , " says Robert Freeman , director of the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester ( N.Y. ) . " Baseball is a game of pauses , and , as in a religious liturgy , these people can link the discrete moments with a musical interlude . " In order to help remedy this neglect , the Eastman School last week conducted a sports-organist seminar at Silver Stadium , the pleasantly dilapidated home of the Triple A Rochester Redwings . As if beckoned by the siren song of the Hammond parked near first base , about 500 locals and roughly The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a positive effect on the team . " I honestly believe , " Lascheid said , " that we can help score runs by getting the fans riled up . " Enlivening a crowd , however , requires a huge repertoire and a sharp memory . When Steve Carlton strides to the mound , Lascheid makes the connection to the cigarette brand with " Smoke , Smoke , Smoke . " Playing off other names , he greets Roland Office with " 9 to 5 , " Dusty Baker with " Dust in the Wind " and Doug Bair with " The Stripper . " But a real pro must also expect the unexpected . " It 's not enough to do ' I 'm Walkin " after a walk or ' Send In the Clowns ' for a relief pitcher , " Faust says . " I 've even got a song for when a player loses his contact lens ' Jeepers Creepers , Where 'd You Get Those Peepers . ' When he finds it , it's'I Can See Clearly Now ' . " Asked how he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sitting at the console , responded by playing a few bars of " So Rare . " Faust thought she 'd probably do " I Get Around . " No one is sure how this form of musicianship began , but knowledgeable observers trace things back to Gladys Goodding , who ( to use a joke employed several times at the seminar ) pulled out all the stops for the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1940 to 1956 . Back in those days , however , the organist rarely played more than the National Anthem and the still obligatory " Take Me Out to the Ball Game . " The concept of the organ as cheerleader did n't evolve until the 1950s , when the instrument was used effectively at Drake University basketball games . Or at least that 's the theory proffered by Jonathan Cohen , 26 , a self-described stadium-organ buff who drove the 400 miles from Boston to meet some of his idols and possibly expand the repertoire of songs he plays while he watches games on TV . But even Cohen was unable to explain why hockey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only sport besides baseball that has embraced the organ wholeheartedly . Rear-View Mirror : Playing in a skating rink is a subject that was barely broached by the panelists , much to the disappointment of the several Canadian organists in attendance . " The acoustical difficulties in hockey are tremendous , " noted Phil LaPenna of the Toronto Maple Leafs . " You ca n't even hear what you sound like . " Robert Raatz , who plays the only surviving pipe organ in American sports for the Chicago Black Hawks , faces the additional challenge of sitting with his back to the ice and having to follow the action through a rear-view mirror . But the biggest problem for hockey organists , said Bob Moppert of the Binghamton ( N.Y. ) Whalers , is the game 's relatively small range of situations . ' T ' , v ? r If a guy gets hurt and the trainer comes out , I play the theme from ' M*A*S*H ' , " Moppert said . " But where do you go from there ? " LaPenna had a suggestion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " try ' A Spoonful of Sugar Helps the Medicine Go Down ' . " By unselfishly swapping ideas , the organists discovered that not even the rule against needling umpires or referees with " Three Blind Mice " is inviolate . " I play just the first three notes ? da-tee-tum ? and then a little variation on the theme , " Lascheid said during a post-seminar discussion held at a cocktail lounge . What looms as a bigger threat . however , is a possible trend among team owners toward prerecorded music . Since the Toronto Blue Jays replaced their organist with rock records last year , the club has risen from last to first place in the American League East . " I know their decision looks good now , " says Moppert , " but I 'm gon na watch and see if the Blue Jays can get to the World Series with canned music . " Better yet , Moppert could send the team a tape of " The Impossible Dream . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
