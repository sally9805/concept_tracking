Syria ups the ante again <P> Shipping arms to the Middle East is like carrying coals to Newcastle , but the news last week still brought shudders . Already a formidable player in the area , Syria will soon boast an even stronger hand . According to U.S. officials , the Soviet Union is preparing to send a new type of mobile battlefield missile , the SS-21 , to Syria for the first time . The surface-to-surface weapon , developed in 1976 and never before deployed outside the Warsaw Pact nations , has a range of about 75 miles . Its immediate predecessor , the FROG-7 , could go only 40 miles . Armed with the more accurate SS-21s , the Syrians would now be able to reach targets far inside Israel , as well as ships of the U.S. Sixth Fleet off the coast of Lebanon . <P> The Syrians are already equipped with FROG-7s and the older Scud missiles , along with batteries of SA-5 surface-to-air weapons manned by Soviet military officers . Since the Syrians seem extremely reluctant to risk a direct attack against Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the buildup of U.S. naval power along the Lebanese coast . Observed President Reagan during his weekly radio talk last Saturday : " We have to wonder aloud about Syrian protestations of their peaceful intentions . " <P> Meanwhile , the government of Amin Gemayel announced last week that " new difficulties " had prevented Lebanon 's multitudinous factions from agreeing on a time and place for their national reconciliation meeting . " New " difficulties ? The problems seemed as new as Cain and Abel . If Lebanon 's warring sects are given a chance to disagree , they will . This time , Suleiman Franjieh , a former President ( 1970-76 ) and one of the leaders of the Syrian-backed National Salvation Front , announced that he would not attend any conference held in Lebanon , while Camille Chamoun , head of the right-wing Christian Lebanese Front , declared that he would not show up at talks convened outside the country . <P> The solution turned out to be the classic one : appoint a commission to study the dispute . Beirut Radio announced that a steering committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pave the way for the promised discussions on a fairer division of national power . The compromise came about after a meeting in New York City between Syrian Foreign Minister Abdel Halim Khaddam and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al Faisal . <P> Since the cease-fire accord worked out by Saudi Arabia and the U.S. went into effect two weeks ago , the Syrian government has relentlessly asserted its influence over Lebanese affairs . Faced with Syrian opposition , Gemayel and the U.S. backed away from their suggestion that the U.N . monitor the ceasefire . The latest proposal calls for the observers to be drawn from U.N . forces now in Lebanon , but to keep them outside U.N . jurisdiction . Another alternative : ask nonaligned nations , such as India and Greece , to supply the truce policemen .
