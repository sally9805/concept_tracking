WASHINGTON  --  The Bush administration has sketched in some of the details of its murky plan to unload hundreds of billions of dollars in assets from failed savings and loans , with that work to be headed by banking regulators . The administration , as part of its original $157 billion S &; rescue proposal sent to Congress in February , proposed that sick thrifts be sold or liquidated , and a new agency , Resolution Trust Corp. , would handle the sale of assets , including everything from securities and mortgages to empty office buildings , horse farms , and the rights to unprofitable movies . The question of how the government will dispose of as much as $400 billion in assets has been the greatest mystery in the thrift legislation , and possibly its greatest remaining stumbling block to passage . But it ' s uncertain whether the new plan will be accepted by Congress as House and Senate negotiators begin mending differences in their separate S &; rescue bills . The House and Senate staffs have been working for weeks on the delicate compromises in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed in during the final hours . " We are not starting from favoring or opposing any individual group ' s point of view , " said Kevin Gottlieb , staff director of the Senate Banking Committee . Under a new proposal sent to Capitol Hill , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. would have primary responsibility for the asset-disposal work . The original proposal called for Resolution Trust Corp. to contract with whomever it chose to sell the assets , with the FDIC being one of the possible contractors . " We have removed all the ambiguity from the proposal , " said David Mullins , assistant secretary of the Treasury . But the administration plan also would preserve the use of the private sector in the unprecedented chore of disposing assets on such a huge scale , and already industry lawyers and real-estate experts are gearing up to pursue that business . That would allow the RTC and FDIC bureaucracy to be kept as lean as possible , Mr. Mullins said . The second prong of the plan creates a separate oversight group to watch over and audit the FDIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s chairman , William Seidman , who has advocated the FDIC ' s inclusion on the oversight board . " It ' s their board and it ' s their plan , " Mr. Seidman said yesterday . " We are working with the administration on this . " Separately , Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady made a plea for Congress to adopt the Bush administration ' s financing plan for the thrift legislation , but didn ' t explicitly say he would recommend a presidential veto without it . " I think we have said before how strongly we feel about that , " Mr. Brady said at a news conference . Mustering a veto might prove difficult , because the administration has prevailed on nearly every other major point in the huge legislation , which overhauls lax industry regulations and closes the doors of the sickest thrifts . The administration ' s roundabout financing plan has proved the exception , however , and is expected to be taken up Thursday by the House and Senate negotiators . The administration would raise funds through industry bonds , with only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal budget . The House has endorsed a plan that would use less-expensive Treasury bonds , but would require a specific exemption from the Gramm-Rudman law ' s deficit targets . Senate leadership in the conference , especially Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle ( D. , Mich. ) , also is sympathetic to the less-expensive House plan .
