Dr. Strangelove walked into a House hearing room last week looking suspiciously like an official of the U.S. Postal Service . Testifying about a 1981 plan for mail delivery after a nuclear war , Ralph H. Jusell , the Postal Service civil defense coordinator , said , " Those that are left will get their mail . " Under the plan , express , registered , certified and special delivery service would have to be suspended for a while , but first-class mail would continue to receive priority treatment ; it would be delivered even if the survivors ran out of stamps . Some preparations are already in place : postal distribution centers have stocked food and medical supplies for their workers . " What good would that do ? " fumed Representative Edward Markey , a Massachusetts Democrat . " There will be no addresses , no streets , no blocks , no houses . " Branding these blueprints " idiotic " and " deceitful , " subcommittee members pointed out that there would also be no trucks , trains or airplanes for delivering the mail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense policy expert , said , " I can assure you that while neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night will stay the postal couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds , nuclear war will .
