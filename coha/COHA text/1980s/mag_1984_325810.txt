A treaty to curb acid rain <P> It is believed to be responsible for the slow death of one-third of West Germany 's forests , the poisoning of lakes and woods in North America and the contamination of drinking water on both continents . But in part because acid rain is an insidious form of air pollution that is carried long distances before falling as rain and snow , there has been little cooperation between those who create the problem and those who suffer its consequences . That is changing . At a meeting in Ottawa last week , representatives of Canada and nine European nations signed an agreement to reduce the sulfur dioxide that spews forth from industrial plants , a major cause of acid rain , by at least 30% before 1993 . The " 30% club , " as the group was quickly dubbed , hopes to pressure other nations , principally the U.S. , to adopt similar controls . Said Canadian Environment Minister Charles Caccia : " You ca n't continue to dump on us the garbage that you are producing on your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of contention between the U.S. and Canada . In February , the Canadian government sent a stiff letter of protest to Washington , accusing the U.S. of ignoring " principles contained in bilateral treaties directed at protecting the North American environment . " The Reagan Administration insists that the huge outlays necessary to reduce sulfur-dioxide emissions significantly in the U.S. can not be justified without further study . The U.S. last year spent $28.8 million on acid-rain research , and , if Congress approves , that will rise to $55.5 million this year . By contrast , Budget Director David Stockman puts the cost of eliminating acid rain at $21 billion , a sum that he has cavalierly translated as $6,000 for every fish saved . The Ottawa agreement , said Environmental Protection Agency Official Fitzhugh Green , " may add some heat , but it wo n't add much light . " <P> Critics of this slow-motion approach warn that a broad-based environmental emergency may already exist . Said Swedish Minister for the Environment Svante Lundkvist : " We know enough to take action now . We must act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. is unmoved by the rising chorus from other Western nations , it may find it harder to ignore critics at home . All of the Democratic candidates for President have talked about acid rain in their campaigns . Additional pressure on the White House came last week when six northeastern states-New York , Connecticut , Vermont , Maine , Massachusetts and Rhode Island-brought suit in Federal District Court in Washington to force the EPA to enact tougher restrictions on sulfur-dioxide emissions . <P> * West Germany , France , Switzerland , Austria , The Netherlands , Denmark , Norway , Sweden and Finland .
