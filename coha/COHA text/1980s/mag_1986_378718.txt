It was the year that Newton 's laws were repealed on Wall Street . What went up never came down  --  at least not for long . After starting 1985 at 1211.57 , the Dow Jones industrial average broke the 1300 barrier in May , smashed 1400 in November and surged to a peak of 1553.10 on Dec. 16 before settling at 1543.00 at the end of last week .

It was a boon to the airlines , which got a break in their fuel bills . Shares of UAL , the parent of United Airlines , have gone up 12.5% , to 49 1/2 . At the same time , oil-company stocks have been lagging behind the rest of the market . Amoco shares have slipped from a high of 70 1/4 to 62 1/4 , and Mobil 's stock has dropped from a peakof 34 3/8 to 30 1/4 . <P> Institutional investors have become an increasingly dominant force in the market .
