txt THE COMFORTABLY ensconced wife in The New Yorker cartoon looks up from her copy of The New York Times and asks her husband , " Who was Carter 's Director of Manage- ment and Budget , anyway ? " now soon tney target . As the cabinet secretaries , adminis- trators , and assorted bureaucrats of the Reagan administra- tion become Washington fixtures , the men and women who wielded power until last January have , for the most part , retreated into obscurity as quickly as they were pinned in the spotlight back in 1977 . That initial dose of public promi- nence may have been stressful , but the phenomenon they are now trying to handle is worse . It 's The Let Down . Shortly before I ended nearly eight years in government in 1979 , I was forewarned by many who had gone through it : ? A former Cabinet secretary told me he does n't think you ever get over the exhilaration of a high government job . " There are compensations - in the private world ? more freedom , more money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power and excitement of the public arena , " he said . ? A former Defense Department official , now a well-paid corporate executive , was excited about his life-aftergovernment . As he began to feel comfortable with his new job , home , and community , The Let Down struck . The organizational politics of his new job were irritating and petty . After all , he had handled national security matters on a grand scale . THE LET Down can be traumatic . Gone are government cars and strivers , press attention ? invitations to the White House . Gone is the sense of being in demand . It 's Let Down time . Gone is the special status of public office and all its special attentions ? especially the personal staff . Most high-level government jobs have this unique and marvelous benefit . And where else can you have a personal staff of several hand-picked people , their sole function to help you do your job ? Management jobs in the private sector may include Barbara ' Hackman Franklin , a former White House adviser and former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ford , and Car- ter , is Senior Fellow in Public Management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.multitudes of subordinates , but not usually a full personal , professsional entourage . And if leaving the government is tough , facing the private sector again is another trauma . Because of widespread mistrust and apprehension today about government , in many quarters you are not a hero for having taken a number of years at low pay to serve your country . Instead , you 're often viewed as part of the problem . Little value is attached to what you did in government . No one on the outside seems to care much . So severe is this part of the Let Down that many keep returning to government service like repeat offenders re- turning to the state penitentiary . While a healthy cross- fertilization between sectors is desirable ? because the country needs to draw on the best talents available ? some powercrats return for the wrong reasons . This " revolving door syndrome " has been cut down a bit of late by the ethics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us . Although some form of Let Down comes with almost any major life change or transition , there 's something more at work when we 're talking about government service . The public policy arena has a sense of exhilaration that is hard to duplicate and difficult to understand unless you 've been there . " BEING OUT " is trauma . What 's suddenly yanked away is the sense of power , the ability to influence the course of events . The all-encompassing national issues and the special attentions contribute to this , but so does Big Government . The bigger and more intrusive government gets , and the more control it has over our lives and livelihoods , the greater is the sense of power that accrues to those who run it . The Reagan administration 's economic program , designed , in part to get Big Government off our backs , may have this beneficial side-effect : It may help cure The Let Down for government officials.rn By reducing the government 's role in a host of economic and social areas , we will inevitably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government official will be more firmly reminded that his mission is to serve the people , not to dictate to them . And , if powercrats no longer build lofty towers quite so far above the people they serve , they may find they do n't have so far to be Let Down upon leaving office . They ? as well as the public ? , stand to gain much from the change . //
