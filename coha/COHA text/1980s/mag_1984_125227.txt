Lyn Watner 's phone rings .... A milk company executive wants Cal Ripken Jr . to schedule a promotional appearance . " Nope , I 'm sorry , he just ca n't , " she says . " Baseball is his career and he 's already at his wit 's end . He needs a few days to get himself together . " // And it rings .... " Who has n't paid his bill ? " A Baltimore Oriole is late with his car insurance premium . Watner will take care of it . // And it rings .... " I 'll accept the charges . " It 's a ballplayer she represents . Inmate No. 01732-031 calling from a federal prison in Texas . " Hey , Willie , how 's it going ? Have you worked out yet today ? Do you understand your contract ? Would you like me to call your mom ? " // To Watner , being a good agent not only means reassuring Willie Aikens ' mother but also seeing to it that Rick Dempsey has a firm mattress during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call so that he can get up in time to do a McDonald 's commercial , remembering to ask Red Sox pitcher Mike Brown about his arm and his love life and telling a young football player he ca n't buy a new car . // For sure , being the only female agent in baseball is n't easy . People are forever asking , " Look , lady , who do you think you are ? " // Not a bad question . // " She 's my agent , " says Murray . Mike Boddicker says , " When I have a problem , I call Lyn , and she handles it . " She has been called both a " life planner " and a " hatchet lady . " Dempsey refers to her as a " secretary . " // While women agents are commonplace in entertainment and publishing , in sports they 're usually limited to tennis and golf . Few women have broken into the network of men who represent baseball , football and basketball players . " I know quite a few agents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know any women , " says Brian McIntyre , the NBA 's director of public relations . // Of the 200-plus agents listed with the Major League Baseball Players Association , Watner , 32 , is the only female . She is one of perhaps a dozen women  --  among more than 500 agents  --  certified by the NFL Players Association , and she is the busiest . // Watner has already made her mark . Kansas City Royals general manager John Schuerholz said he 'd rather do business with her than with some of his own players . // Watner is a vice-president of Personal Management Associates , a Baltimore-based company representing about 80 professional athletes , including 16 of the world champion Orioles . Lawyer Ron Shapiro and Hall of Famer Brooks Robinson founded the company in 1977 after Robinson 's finances went bust in a post-retirement business deal . // Shapiro built the company by taking what he calls a " holistic approach " to representing players . If a player signs with the firm , he does n't just get someone to negotiate a contract . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gets a yearly budget and an investment portfolio . He gets someone who 'll listen to him talk about an injury , and he gets consoled after a bad game . He also gets a personal phone call every 10 days , and , if necessary , someone to sit beside him during drug or alcohol rehabilitation sessions. // It 's Watner who delivers many of these nontraditional agent services . In her six years on the job she has worked her way up from part-time Spanish translator to full-time partner ; Shapiro hired her in 1978 because he could n't understand a new client , Nicaraguan-born Oriole pitcher Dennis Martinez . // " I really felt inadequate at first , " says Watner , who spent hours poring over The Sporting News to learn still another language  --  sports lingo. // What Watner has going for her is life experience . At 18 she lost her closest friend , her father , who died of leukemia . They used to go to the races together , and he would tell her just how beautiful and how miserable life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father had gone to school , Watner responded , " College of Hard Knocks . " // Watner is an expert at counseling young athletes on avoiding life 's pitfalls ; she 's stumbled a few times herself . She moved to Mexico when she was 20 , was married , divorced , remarried and divorced again , all before she was 25 . To support herself she taught English . // When the phone rang one day last July , it was Willie Aikens , and he had stumbled pretty badly . " Lyn , " he said , obviously frightened , " the FBI was just here . " // By December , Watner and Aikens were attending family night drug-rehabilitation therapy sessions at Sheppard-Pratt Hospital in Baltimore , where Aikens was an in-patient . Aikens had pleaded guilty to a charge of attempted possession of cocaine and faced a three-month prison term . // " I was in a strange town and with no family , " said Aikens of his stay in Baltimore . ( He was released last month from the Federal Correctional Institution in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got him in a trade with Kansas City . ) " Lyn is the one . Every time I need her , she 's always there for me . She was the one who stood next to me in court . She was the one who helped me through therapy . And she was the first person to visit me in jail . " // During the last family night session , the therapist let each patient speak . Aikens thanked the therapist , and then he finished by thanking his fellow patients . But it was n't until another patient had thanked Watner that Aikens realized what he 'd forgotten to do . He started crying . " I was so embarrassed . Of all the people there , I really wanted to say something about Lyn . I wanted to say that I had grown because of her . " // The week after Aikens left Sheppard-Pratt , Martinez entered a program there for alcohol abuse . Again , for support , Watner attended family nights  --  16 weeks altogether . // Watner feels less comfortable in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruiting clients . She became fed up with what some of the athletes said was their bottom line : " I 'll sign as long as you 're willing to go to bed with me . " Now Watner usually leaves recruiting to the male members of the firm . // Being one of the first women in her field poses other problems . One player said Watner 's prominent role in the agency kept him from signing for a long time . " As much as I was touted by the other players , he thought I was a secretary , and he did n't want to deal with me , " says Watner . But she does n't dwell on the difficulties of being a woman in a male-dominated business . " Sure , it 's harder , " she says , " and if it takes two years longer , so what ? " // Lately she 's been especially busy working with Cal Ripken and his brother Billy , a minor-leaguer . For Cal she devised a program under which he 'll give 2,000 Oriole tickets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . She gave Billy , who has just signed on , a briefing and reviewed his personal financial history . // Watner rarely has time to go out for lunch . During a noon staff meeting , she squeezes in a snack of soup , French fries and grape drink . Midway through , a grumpy , unshaven Boddicker comes in . " I feel terrible , " he says . // " I heard you were a little huffy yesterday at the McDonald 's rehearsal , " says Watner . Along with Murray , four other Orioles were involved in the commercial . // " My feet were killing me , " Boddicker replies . // Then Murray and Dempsey appear . Dempsey places his hands on either side of Watner 's face and tries to kiss her . She wriggles away , scolding , " Now , do n't be bratty. " // Watner handles a number of promotional requests each day . Today , Baltimore Magazine wants an Oriole to pose for a spring fashion spread . Watner asks Murray if he can do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day , Lyn . You 'd better get Cal , " he says . // Some players do n't like Watner because she pushes too much , says Dempsey . " But they 're dumb . She has asked me to call someone at a hospital , to go on a talk show and do public appearances for nothing , and later down the road it has always led to better deals . A lot of guys do n't realize how smart she is. " // Boddicker knows what an ally Watner can be , especially after the 1983 World Series brought him sudden fame . " I 'm a soft and easy person . I say yes to everything-banquets , speeches , commercials and friends . But now I tell them , ' You 'd better talk to my agent , Lyn . ' She 's a tough lady . " // " They call me the hatchet lady because one of the biggest things I do is to say no , " says Watner . To a young football player who wants to buy a car : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Murray , who was eager to invest in a videogame store : " No , too risky . " To general managers in Latin American baseball leagues : " M ? s dinero. " // Watner would enjoy negotiating big league contracts , but so far the firm has limited her to dealing with Latin American leagues . " Negotiating is Ron 's forte , and it 's a chauvinistic world We live in , " says Watner . " The Latin leagues are the pits . Pay is $3,500 a month tops , so you have to finagle your way and see what else you can get for your client  --  a car , expenses , et cetera. " // Watner is in the office by 8 a.m. , and some days she 's still talking business with Shapiro at midnight . Four hours of sleep suffice ; Watner rises at 4:45 a.m. , walks three miles and then works out on Nautilus machines or plays tennis , often before sunrise . // As the sun sets this day , Watner is mumbling about the 1984 Roberto Clemente Award @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserved it . // Her last appointment of the day is with a young man seeking her advice on how to become an agent . Watner spends half an hour telling him just how difficult it can be .
