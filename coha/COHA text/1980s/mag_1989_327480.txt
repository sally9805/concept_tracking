Here we go again . Exploiting white America 's ignorance of historic racial oppression , Hollywood casts a spotlight on the rich but neglected story of the black struggle for equal rights . As has happened with every popular work on the subject , from Uncle Tom 's Cabin to Roots , Mississippi Burning evokes a gasp of horrified discovery from many whites who act as if they are learning about the viciousness of slavery and segregation for the very first time . Unfortunately , the film does little to deepen the knowledge of its audience . Though its producers say the movie is fictional , they so artfully commingle fact and invention that many viewers , whose ability to discern a whopper when they see one has been obliterated by an age of TV docudramas , are convinced of its veracity . They leave the theater believing a version of history so distorted that it amounts to a cinematic lynching of the truth . <P> From its opening sequence , Burning convincingly recaptures the racial dread of 1964 Mississippi . But the verisimilitude is soon sacrificed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacks , the Federal Government sank to the same level of lawless terror occupied by the Ku Klux Klan . To the extent they appear at all , blacks are portrayed as ineffectual victims , helplessly waiting for the " Kennedy boys " to set them free . In due course , that is just what happens , as the FBI cracks the case by brutally intimidating a white witness . <P> Not much of this is within spitting distance of what really occurred . Even the little details in the film  --  such as placing James Chaney , a black thoroughly familiar with the terrifying back roads of Neshoba County , in the backseat of the station wagon he was actually driving  --  relegate blacks to the background of the drama of which they were the real-life heroes . One gets no sense of their courageous struggle against violent white supremacy and second-class citizenship . <P> Even more twisted is the film 's depiction of an FBI so zealous in its defense of black rights that it would resort to vigilantism to promote them . That contention is laughable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the bureau to take a more active role in protecting blacks . Only two weeks before the murders , a delegation of Mississippi activists journeyed to Washington to implore federal officials to protect the civil rights workers who were flocking into the state for the Freedom Summer . Yet despite repeated appeals to the FBI and Justice Department on the night the three civil rights workers disappeared , nearby agents did not arrive in Philadelphia until the next day . By then it was too late .
