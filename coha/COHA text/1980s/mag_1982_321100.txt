Coppola unveils his new film in a bankruptcy-defying stunt <P> Come one , come all to the Greatest Show on Earth ! The Zoetrope Circus is back in town ! Famous for its tradition of death-defying stunts ! Three years ago they thrilled you with Apocalypse Now-and made you gasp with public previews on two continents , perpetually revised endings , ruptured psyches ! Last year they made you weep with the spectacle of a three-ring movie studio on the verge of bankruptcy , only to be saved at the last minute by the world-renowned Paramount Pictures ! And now , for their most stupendous caper , never before attempted on any stage . . . One From the Heart ! It will be presented-without the sponsorship of Paramount-at the legendary Radio City Music Hall in the heart of glamorous Manhattan ! So come ! See a high-wire artiste , a pratfalling clown , a man who shoots himself from cannons , a spellbinding ringmaster. . . all wrapped up in the person of Mr. Zoetrope himself , Francis Coppola ! <P> All the guy did was rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Francis Coppola , 42 , director of the Godfather films and Apocalypse Now ; and the hall was the 6,000-seat art deco monument in Rockefeller Center ; and the movie was a $26 million love story whose ballooning budget carried Coppola 's Zoetrope Studios further on its drift toward disaster ; and in violation of all movieland protocol , the preview was arranged without notifying the film 's distributor . And so , with one full-page ad placed in last Sunday 's New York Times , Coppola turned One From the Heart from a potential loser into the year 's first big media event . This Friday night , thousands of the movie-mad and the just plain curious will crowd into the Music Hall to watch this world-class shaman pull a rabbit-or a dog-out of his hat . " It 's a brilliant move , " marvels Writer-Director Paul Schrader ( American Gigolo ) . " If it 's a hit he can wipe out a year of bad publicity . " <P> The past year has not been kind to Coppola and Zoetrope . Three movies the studio was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also Hammett , German Director Wim Wenders ' moody detective drama , and Escape Artist , Caleb Deschanel 's saga of a runaway boy-have yet to be seen . The Chase Manhattan Bank , which had lent millions to Coppola , cut off the funding . Staff salaries were met with the help of Paramount Pictures , which bought one of Zoetrope 's scripts and offered Coppola a low-interest loan . Paramount also secured the distribution rights to One from the Heart . <P> The film , a stylized musical set in Las Vegas on Independence Day , recounts the affairs of a junkyard owner ( Frederic Forrest ) with two women : a travel agent ( Teri Garr ) and a circus star ( Nastassia Kinski ) . Coppola calls Heart " a lounge operetta , pretty and sweet . I 've made too many gangster and soldier movies . I like fantasy and fable-it 's a large part of me . " It is also a huge part of the film 's budget : Dean Tavoularis ' dazzling sets cost more than $6 million to build . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suspended as Coppola wooed other investors-and in August , Paramount showed a very rough cut to a group of disappointed exhibitors . Coppola the lion tamer felt caged ; it was time to crack the whip and see who jumped .
