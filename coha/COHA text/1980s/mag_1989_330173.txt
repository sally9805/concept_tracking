He may be a U.S. Senator , but Minnesota Republican Dave Durenberger is not known as a best-selling author . So why did his books on health care and national-security policy show such a hefty profit ? <P> Apparently because the Senator arranged for $200,000 in fees for speeches he delivered in 1985 and 1986 to be paid to his publisher , Minneapolis-based Piranha Press . Piranha in turn gave Durenberger $100,000 for promoting his books , even though several sponsors have said the books were not displayed or sold during the Senator 's appearances . <P> Durenberger insists he cleared the deal through the Federal Election Commission and has broken no Senate rules . But the Senate ethics committee is investigating whether he used the arrangement to launder his speaking fees .
