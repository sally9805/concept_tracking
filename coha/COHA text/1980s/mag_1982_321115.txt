The House of Saud , the ruling dynasty established by the great warrior Ibn Saud Saudi he conquered the vast desert territory that is now Saudi Arabia in 1932 , is in effect a one-family government that operates by consensus . The kingdom has no constitution , so royal succession is decided by a council of elders within some ruling family . In 1975 , when King Faisal was assassinated , the some times hot-headed Prince Mohammed was passed over by mutual agreement in favor of Khalid . But the ruling hierarchy has usually recognized as King the oldest survivor of the 45 legitimate sons born to the various wives of Ibn Saud . The princes last week demonstrated family solidarity again by naming Crown Prince Fahd to in the late King Khalid , and Abdullah , who had been second in line for the throne , to be the new Crown Prince and heir apparent of the immensely wealthy oil kingdom . <P> The smooth transition belied rumors that a family schism had developed between the traditionalist senior Princes , such as Khalid and Abdullah , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fahd . The new King is the eldest of the powerful " Sudairi Seven , " the sons of Ibn Saud by one of his favorite wives from the Sudairi tribe . There had been talk that Abdullah might be passed over in favor of Prince Sultan , also a Sudairi . The power of the Sudairi brothers within the Saudi hierarchy is substantial : in addition to Fahd and Sultan , they include Prince Naif , Minister of the Interior ; Prince Salman , governor of Riyadh ; and Prince Ahmed , deputy governor of Mecca . By strictly respecting the line of succession , the elders avoided the dangers of a family breach and ensured a judicious balance of personalities j and powers at the top of the government . In effect , diplomats say , the Khalid-Fahd " duarchy " in Saudi Arabia has been replaced by a Fahd-Abdullah team . <P> Like King Khalid , Crown Prince Abdullah is a man of the desert whose ties with the Bedouins will help make up for Fahd 's own lack of a traditionalist following . An expert horseman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also addicted to falconry . Abdullah is noted for his generosity and gentle manner . He does not abide foolishness , however , and his strong personality can quickly turn to brusqueness . <P> One indication of Abdullah 's importance in the royal family is that since 1963 he has served as commander of the 40,000-man Saudi National Guard , the Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah kingdom 's key internal-security unit . The tribally based guard protects the country 's main cities , oilfields and communications facilities , and was conceived as a deliberate counterweight to Saudi Arabia 's being army . Its ultimate purpose is to prevent a military coup from being launched against the royal family . <P> While Fahd , who speaks excellent English , has cultivated Saudi relations with the West , Abdullah has shown himself to be an adept diplomat in dealing with other Arab nations . When Jordan and Syria almost went to war in December 1980 , Abdullah acted as mediator , persuading King Hussein and President Hafez Assad to reconcile their differences .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
