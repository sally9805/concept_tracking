Using sound waves to disintegrate painful kidney stones <P> Kidney stones are one of man 's most common afflictions , and among the most agonizing . As many as one in ten American males and one in 40 women will eventually suffer excruciating pain caused by the accumulation of crystalline material in the kidneys . The incidence of the disease is two to three times higher in the Southeast U.S. , which , for reasons unknown-perhaps diet , water supply or climate-has one of the highest rates of kidney stones in the world . Usually a stone will be spontaneously excreted by the sufferer . But each year about 200,000 Americans are hospitalized for the ailment , and 10% to 25% require major surgery that is both costly and painful . <P> A new instrument , developed in West Germany and Austria , is now making this surgery obsolete in many cases . The percutaneous nephroscope allows doctors to remove stones through a tiny opening in the patient 's back or to shatter them into harmless fragments with bombardments of sound waves . Introduced in the U.S. in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by more than a dozen major medical centers around the country . <P> Doctors begin the new procedure by administering a local anesthetic and making an incision no larger than in . Conventional surgery would have required an 8-in. to 10-in. cut . A catheter is inserted near the stone , and , depending on the circumstances , the patient will either be sent home for a week , while his urine drains into a bag , or remain overnight in the hospital . The advantage of waiting a week is that it allows time for tissues around the opening to harden , thus enabling doctors to complete the job using only local anesthesia . <P> When the patient returns to the operating room , the surgeon removes the catheter and inserts the nephroscope . Optic fibers in the device provide a clear view of the quarry . The doctor then eases a tiny , basket-like grabbing device through the nephroscope and manipulates it to grasp and remove the stone . <P> If the stone is too big to be " basketed , " doctors insert a metal rod that conducts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to be pretty hard , " says Urologist Robert Kahn of the University of California at San Francisco , " but once the thing is cracked , it falls apart . " The fragments are removed by suction or the grabbing tool . Total time from start to finish : between half an hour and two hours , depending on the size , number and chemical composition of the stones . <P> " After this procedure , patients are up and around pain-free the next morning , " reports Urologist Culley Carson of Duke University Medical Center . " It would be difficult for them to walk around for three or four days after conventional surgery . " Another advantage : nephroscopy patients can return to their jobs in about a week ; surgical patients require ten days of costly hospitalization and up to eight weeks of convalescence . " There really is no trauma to the system with this method , " says Dr. Joseph Segura of the Mayo Clinic , which pioneered the technique in the U.S. <P> Ultrasonic therapy should be an especially valuable technique for patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually destroy the kidneys . Says Carson : " With the new technique , there is less risk . "
