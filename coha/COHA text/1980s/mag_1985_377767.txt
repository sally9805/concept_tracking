Want to teach but have no credential ? asks the headline on a poster inside the Los Angeles unified school district 's crash recruiting center . " Relax , " continues the pitch . " We can help you get your teaching credential while you work full time as a junior or senior high school teacher ... " <P> The poster and the recruiting center reflect a surprising trend : a teacher shortage that promises to get worse , not only in Los Angeles but throughout the state of California and some other parts of the country . Within the next few weeks Los Angeles must find 2,500 new instructors for its classrooms . Before the bell rings for the new term , California needs a total of some 16,500 additional elementary and secondary teachers , a number that Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig believes will jump to about 110,000 by 1991 . Conservative predictions from the National Center for Education Statistics put the countrywide demand at slightly over 200,000 new teachers in 1991 , with a shortfall in supply of only 66,000 ( see chart ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education Association , says , " By the 1990s we may need a million new teachers . " <P> The shortage has already hit hard in the most populous Sunbelt states , catching some educators looking the other way . School-age populations fell off 5.3% , to 44.9 million , from 1980 to 1984 , as the last of the World War II baby boomers graduated . But meanwhile , the number of preschoolers surged 9% , to 17.8 million . And now the vanguard of this baby boomlet has hit first grade , where enrollments rose from a 33-year low of 2,894,000 in 1980 to 3,079,000 for 1983-84 , with more coming . In the Sunbelt states , the boomlet is being compounded by massive immigration from the snow country and the Third World . Texas , which had 3.42 million public school students in 1970 , expects enrollments of 5.25 million by the year 2000 . Florida 's public school population , 1.56 million in 1984 , is projected at 2.1 million for 2000 . And California , with 4.1 million students , is bracing for an additional 724,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when veteran teachers are fleeing the profession , and college students , put off primarily by the poor salaries ( an average of $17,000 to start ) and the low job prestige , are veering away from education careers . As recently as 1968 , nearly 25% of college freshmen favored teaching as a profession , but last year only 5.5% showed any interest . Among the remaining young people who do decide to teach , reportedly up to half quit within five to seven years . <P> Most threatening of all , perhaps , is the imminent prospect of numerous retirements . The average age of American teachers has risen to an estimated 40 to 43 , and in the next five years , 30% to 50% of the instructors are expected to bow out . The retirement trend has been accelerated in some part by recent efforts to upgrade qualifications . This spring , for example , Arkansas imposed a very unpopular competency test on all its teachers . And though results released last month showed that only 10% had flunked various sections of the exam , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " on morale . Apparently so . Early retirements in Arkansas have shot up close to 33% . Teachers in other states may soon be following them . Eighteen states now require competency tests , and two weeks ago the N.E.A. voted to support such exams for all new teachers .
