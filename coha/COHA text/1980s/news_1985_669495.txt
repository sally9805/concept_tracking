Stiff-backed wooden chairs have been replaced by cushy swivels , naked floors by sound-absorbing carpet . Blackboards have been replaced by nonglare white boards . A satellite dish perches atop the roof . New AT &; T computers sit on every desk . And a big , closed-circuit TV screen hangs from one corner , broadcasting C-Span ( Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network ) . A teacher can press a button to alter the video source of the images displayed on the screen from moment to moment. // // Obviously , this is a classroom in which high-technology and education have married. // But will the marriage last ? // Critics and advocates differ in their estimates but agree on what matters most : a need for improving the quality of teaching and learning. // ' ' Today we can bring the world into the classroom at the flip of a switch , ' ' says district superintendent of education Keith Larick , sounding a bit like a proud father . ' ' This classroom represents a deliberate decision to create a preferred future - a prototype school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Until now , people thought of computers as the answer to our unending problems with education , ' ' says Kerry Johnson , computer and telecommunications coordinator of the classroom . ' ' We ' re not emphasizing computers . They ' re just one part of the technology . We wanted to systematically study and test which equipment worked well for our purposes , which combinations were appropriate for teaching and learning. ' ' // At an official unveiling , parents and community leaders had the opportunity to play student in the classroom of the future . Their questions revealed both enthusiasm and misgivings . ' ' How can we get this at our school ? We want our kids to have it . ' ' And ' ' This is scary . The kids will pass us up by the fourth grade. ' ' // Doubts are voiced by educators as well . Bill Habermehl , assistant superintendent for educational services of the Orange County Department of Education , thinks the Brookhaven idea is too new to spread to other districts . ' ' Placentia bit off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapt portions of the program. ' ' // When the Placentia School District decided to incorporate the latest technology into its schools , decisionmakers were unsure about how to proceed . A task force , working in conjunction with specialists from AT &; T , settled on the concept of a prototype classroom . In a unique business relationship that could serve as a model for other districts , AT &; T is providing hardware and services at no charge in exchange for demonstrations of its equipment . And the Virginia-based National Information Utilities , together with the local phone company , Pacific Telesis , provide support . Without this kind of plan , Mr. Larick says , it would cost the school about $1 million per 1 , 000 students to buy the kind of technology in this room. // Some $50 , 000 for other aspects of the project came out of a district fund earmarked for technology , Larick adds . Another $500 , 000 is budgeted for additional equipment in the coming year. // The district is applying for state and federal grants , and project members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another innovative source of income : When the classroom is fully up and running , the school plans to lease equipment after school hours to corporations and universities , for private use. // The idea behind the classroom is simple : By keeping the technology captive for a while , this affluent district will test hardware and software before making heavy financial investments in equipment for other classrooms and schools. // Meanwhile , the task force can address pressing questions : Which hardware is best suited to teaching and learning ? Which combinations of equipment work best together ? How do you refit older classrooms ? How do you train teachers to use new methods of transmitting information ? How do you involve parents ? And , of course , what are the long-term effects on student interest and performance ? // A new elementary school , scheduled to open in Yorba Linda , Calif. , in January 1987 , will be the first of the district ' s schools to get a complete high-tech classroom modeled on this prototype. // Here at Brookhaven , teacher training is under way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The impact of this kind of classroom on students remains unknown . Critics are worried that computers could supplant teachers . Richard Clark , an educational psychologist at the University of Southern California , likens educators ' current love affair with computers to an earlier affair with instructional television . ' ' Advocates make similar claims with each new medium , ' ' he says . Mr. Clark , who has been studying the effects of computer-based instruction for the last few years , adds , however , that ' ' in education , the medium is not the message . ' ' Instead of being totally preoccupied with technology , he cautions , ' ' we should focus on developing instructional strategies. ' ' // Margaret Herron , principal at Brookhaven and chairwoman of the task force , disagrees . ' ' Until now , teachers have primarily used lectures and a chalkboard to teach . In this setting , they need to choreograph as many as 30 children , handling discipline problems and giving a lesson all at once . But if students are engaged with computers , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace . We believe students will end up with more personal contact rather than less. ' ' // Others worry about parents being left behind , as their children take off into the world of tomorrow . But in this case the parents are built into the plan - and they do not need to own computers . For the small price of a modem , Mr. Johnson says , parents will have access via phone lines and television sets to information about attendance and homework . They will also be able to send messages to , and receive them from , their chidren ' s teachers. // At a preliminary test of the hookup between home and school , parents recently dialed into the Times-Mirror data base and news service to help their kids with homework . Johnson says , ' ' The home takes on a vital new role in this light : the responsibility for learning. ' ' // // // // //
