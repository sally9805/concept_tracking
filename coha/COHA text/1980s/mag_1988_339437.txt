The revelations were enough to curl the hair on the neck of the most seasoned nuclear engineer . Last April a reactor at the Federal Government 's sprawling Savannah River Plant near Aiken , S.C. , was shut down to upgrade safety systems  --  with partially irradiated tritium still in its core . In August technicians , oblivious to the decaying radioactive material inside , tried to restart the reactor but were unable to keep it going . The next day they tried again . Ignoring procedure , they set off an abnormal jump in nuclear fission , usually a sign of imminent trouble . Workers ignored the warning , forcing plant officials to intervene to shut down the reactor . <P> For decades , such incidents have been alarmingly frequent at the aging facility , which manufactures materials for nuclear bombs . Moreover , officials at the Department of Energy , which oversees the plant , conceded last week that dozens of such near accidents and nuclear mishaps have gone largely unreported for more than 30 years . Admitted DOE safety chief Richard Starostecki : " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been shut down . " <P> Ever since it went on line in 1953 , the Savannah River facility has operated behind a barrier of secrecy so impenetrable that officials in Washington were often in the dark . In recent months Government investigators have begun to turn up internal memos that are shattering the silence . The result : a congressional hearing that revealed a stunning list of nuclear incidents caused by a combination of primitive instrumentation , inadequately trained personnel and a management meltdown by both DOE and E.I. du Pont de Nemours , which runs the plant for the Federal Government . The impact on the environment is not yet fully known , but thousands of gallons of radioactive material have already leaked into the groundwater . The contamination , says a 1985 Du Pont memo , may exist " centuries or millennia into the future . " <P> The pivotal facility is projected to consume 19% of the $8.1 billion DOE budget for weapons production next year . Some 17,900 people work on its 192,323-acre site , even though two of Savannah River 's five reactors are shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run at full power in part because of deficiencies in their emergency cooling systems . Still , the plant is the sole supplier of plutonium and tritium , the flint and steel of nuclear warheads . While the nation probably has all the plutonium it needs , tritium , which enhances plutonium 's yield , has a half-life of twelve years and must be continuously produced to maintain the nation 's nuclear stockpile . <P> Shortly after his appointment in 1985 , Secretary of Energy John Herrington established an internal DOE team , known as the " junkyard dogs , " to look into safety problems at federal nuclear facilities . After the Soviet Union 's Chernobyl disaster in 1986 , Herrington turned to the National Academy of Sciences to assess the situation in South Carolina . An academy panel concluded last year that DOE was torn by the " conflicting responsibilities " of meeting production quotas while maintaining safety . Operation of the facilities , it said , had been left in the hands of " largely self-regulated contractors , " while safety oversight was " ingrown and largely outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
