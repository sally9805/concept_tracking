It was midway through the third period , and the Nets were building a surprising edge in the contest , which they would eventually win . But there was another game in progress , the one between Williams and Maurice Lucas , who was a Net and Williams ' s mentor in training camp. // Williams , who is 6 foot 8 inches and a sculptured 215 pounds , matched Lucas , who is 6-9 and a barrel-chested 215 , bruise for bruise about the court. // Williams snared a ball off the Nets ' offensive board with both of his long , strong arms outstretched . Then , with a groan , he launched himself toward the hoop for a dunk . But there was Lucas , the man who would later say , " My job is to foul my man and let him know he ' s been fouled. " // That , he did . Lucas locked Williams about the head and shoulders ; Williams did not score . Then , in a quick moment , the usually even-tempered Williams took a roundhouse swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Lucas and the gaze of the officials , and Williams was restrained by the players on the court. // His point was made . The rookie was not to be intimidated any more - by anyone . If Buck Williams is not judged to be the this season ' s best rookie , then it will only be because rebounders - the game ' s workmen - are not as esteemed as the high scorers and flashy passers. // In fact , not since Dave Cowens was voted the honor after the 1970-71 season has the top rookie been , essentially , a rebounder . Cowens - after whom Williams says he patterns his own style - averaged 15. 0 rebounds , third in the league , that season and scored 17. 0 points a game for the Boston Celtics . But even he was a co-winner , with Geoff Petrie , a pure scorer. // This season , Williams has been overshadowed by Isiah Thomas and Kelly Tripucka of Detroit and Mark Aguirre of Dallas . They are more prolific scorers - Aguirre is averaging 23. 6 , Thomas is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a talented point guard and Tripucka has been outstanding shuttling between the forward and guard positions for the Pistons. // But for rebounding , Williams has no peers among this freshman class . Williams has started each of the Nets ' 27 games , averaging 14. 7 points . More importantly , he has amassed 329 rebounds , which is third in the league . Williams also has 100 offensive rebounds , second only to the perennial leader in that category , Moses Malone. // Lucas says Williams , " follows the ball well . He has a nose for it . " And Boston ' s Robert Parish said he was " shocked " at Williams ' s talent. // Williams ' s initial weeks in the pros have been a succession of awakenings . " The first thing I had to get used to the physical part of it , " he says . But Williams has always been a physical player , says those who have known him , so that was an easy adjustment. // But once the season began , things changed . " I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact that the pro game is eight minutes longer than the college game . " I would be looking up at the clock and saying , ' Isn ' t this thing over yet ? ' " // Then there was the travel . During the Nets ' six-game , 13-day road trip in November , Williams was a tired young man by the time the team reached its final stop , Dallas . It showed in his statistics. // In Seattle , Williams learned about intimidation , facing Lonnie Shelton , whom he calls his toughest opponent . " He kept talking all game , " Williams recalled with a laugh , " saying things like , ' You won ' t get any rebounds here , rookie. ' and stuff like that - unprintable stuff. " // Perhaps Williams lowest moment happened off the court , when he learned that his best friend on the team , Ray Tolbert , had been traded to Seattle while the Nets were in Houston. // Williams did not know of the move until the team bus stopped at the airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The veterans were sitting there like nothing happened , " Williams said later . " I didn ' t see how they could do that. " // Charles Linwood Williams was born on March 8 , 1960 , in a four-room house on Fountain Street in Rocky Mount , N.C. - the hometown of another talented player , Phil Ford , now of Kansas City . Williams was the last of Betty and Moses Williams ' s five children - " not the baby , but the youngest , " Buck will say - and the first to attend college . The old house sits empty , just a few blocks from the new four-bedroom home Williams bought for his family in October. // Betty Williams still works six days a week at a local Y.W.C.A. , while Moses Williams is a retired bricklayer . Their new home is one of the few reflections of their son ' s six-year contract worth a reported $2. 5 million . Buck spends much of his free time alone in a rented apartment in Hackensack , N.J. , and drives a Buick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years , he says. // " I ' ve got to look forward to something , " Williams says . " If I get a Mercedes now , what will I get later ? " One sees that logic - " I like to take things one step at a time , " he often says - in everything Williams does . One of Betty Williams ' s most vivid memories of her son is that he loved her Southern cooking . " He always liked to eat , " she says . " And I always loved cooking for him . But he was kind of bunchy and we used to have to buy big clothes for him. " // In fact , Williams was so stocky that a friend of his father ' s called him Huckabuck , an expression that , loosely defined , means a large , hulking person . The name was eventually shortened to Buck. // It was a hot July day in 1970 when the oldest brother , Moses , decided to take a lunchtime hiatus from picking tobacco by taking a swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long after he had eaten his lunch , Moses was hit by cramps and he drowned. // Moses Sr. spent that day staring at the pond where his son had died . And for years afterward , Mrs. Williams suffered nightmares about her son ' s death . As for Charles , who was perhaps the closest of the children to Moses , his brother ' s death was a turning point . During Moses ' s free time , he would hoist young Charles into the air so that he could put the ball through the hoop in their backyard. // " I often wonder what I would be like I he was still around , would I be as independent , " he says . " I ' m going to name my first kid Moses , too. " // Despite the frolicking in his backyard , Williams has not always been so interested in basketball . He wasn ' t very good at the sport . Instead , he played football in junior high school - tight end and defensive end. // But Reggie Henderson , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to join the basketball team , of which Henderson was the head coach . Soon , Williams was hooked , and he credits Henderson with much of his basketball development . " I would describe myself as rough and ragged when I came to him , " Williams says . " But he taught me to conserve my energy and stop just throwing elbows . He helped my on my techniques on outlet passes and dribbling , things that have become routine. " // With Williams , Rocky Mount High won its first state basketball title in his senior year , something it couldn ' t accomplish with Phil Ford . The deluge of mail from colleges had already begun to smother Williams. // " Charles knew we were poor and he always wanted to help out a litte by taking jobs , " Mrs. Williams says . " But school was always real important to him . A lot of kids around here used to duck school and get into trouble . But I never had any trouble with him. " // Like many great players from the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of North Carolina . But throughout the recruiting process , Williams felt slighted by its coach , Dean Smith. // " I loved the place , " Williams says . " But deep down I knew that I wasn ' t as valuable to them as their other recruits . " There was a sense that Smith was not impressed with Williams ' s ability to maintain his studies , a sense Williams disproved by sustaining a 2. 7 grade-point average in college. // Williams ' s most persistent pursuer was Lefty Driesell of the Maryland . " He made the big pitch early , " Henderson remembers . " He , or someone from the school , was at every game and that meant a great deal to Buck. // " North Carolina didn ' t even show until his team made the playoffs . Had they started earlier , Buck would have chosen them. " // Williams ' s almost instant impact in the N.B.A. has some observers wondering why he seems to be a better pro than he was a college player. // In fact , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons at Maryland , Williams led the Atlantic Coast Conference in rebounding twice , and became the school ' s secondleader in career rebounding , behind Len Elmore , who is also a Net . He also finished 10th on the Division I career list for field-goal accuracy , hitting 62 percent of his shots . Yet , he existed in the shadows of Maryland ' s stars - like Albert King , a Net teammate. // " He was our horse , " Driesell said of Williams last week . " He probably didn ' t get the ball as much as he should have . But for pure athletic ability - strength , agility - he was great . Took players like Ralph Sampson and locked them up for the night. " // Last spring , Henderson suggested to Williams that he look into the possibilities of foregoing his last season of college eligibility and turn pro. // Henderson says the response to his calls around the league was " mind-boggling . " Very few people knew of Williams ' s inquiries into leaving college . He called Driesell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also called his mother. // " He said one night that he was thinking of going pro , " she recalls . " And I told him to do the best he could . But when I hung up the phone , I cried because I knew that I wouldn ' t be seeing him much any more . I ' m really glad he did it , but I miss him so badly. " // It was 15 minutes prior to the midnight deadline last spring for informing the N.B.A. of one ' s wishes to enter the college draft . The offices of Donald Dell ' s law firm in Washington , D.C. , was quiet , save for the thoughts of a nervous Buck Williams. // He had been there since 6 A.M. , listening to an attorney speak to the top few teams in the draft . Coach Dick Motta of Dallas said he liked Williams , but they needed scoring . Detroit was interested in Thomas , as were a few members of the Nets ' organization. // " I wanted no part of Isiah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the class of the draft . " Although Williams still says he did not want to leave college , the offers were too tantalizing to refuse . The money , he says , " forced me out. " // It took Williams several days to get over what he had done , the pressure he had applied on himself . And it was not until training camp began last October that he realized he belonged. // After his oncourt meeting with Lucas last week , Williams apologized , stating that that was not his personality to do such a thing . But he added : " My point was clear . I wanted Lucas to know that I ' m here to stay. " //
