 | For years I hid my bald head under a wig and the real me behind a wall of shame . Then something wonderful happened . As a little girl I had a healthy head of hair , but at age 20 it suddenly fell out in clumps . Wigs allowed me to hide my baldness ? until I at last found the courage to " go public . " The summer I was 20 years old , I lost all my hair . It fell out in clumps until it was so thin I needed to buy a partial hairpiece to cover the missing patches . My parents , who were as shocked and distraught as I was , did n't want me to return to college for my senior year , but to stay and live with them , near doctors . I sensed that staying at home would be a retreat from life , and I returned to the 1'niyer ; sits of Wisconsin . But only a week later , I flew home , by then totally bald , and was fitted for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it then , but I was in a state of trauma from which I would n't emerge for 20 years . The wigs would hide my baldness from others , more importantly , they would allow me to hide from myself . The initial diagnosis was " alope- cia areata " or " just a small hair loss . " But at some point ? I honestly ca n't remember when ? it became " alopecia universalis , " a total loss of hair every place on the body . I think I have no memory of when the rest of my hair fell out because I felt that if my body was going to treat me so shabbily , I was going to divorce myself from it . My doctor told me there was no known cure for alopecia , though there were some treatments we could try . I was in no mood to be grateful . ! laving lost my hair , I believed I had lost my worth . So I returned to college , and slowly my life began to contract in subtle ways as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stole in and out of the showers at odd hours when no one else was around to see me take off my wig , wrap it in a towel , and stealthily wash my head . Although the wig was often uncomfortably tight and warm , I kept it on even in the privacy of my room . I developed fears of being discovered , uncovered . Most of all I was afraid that my stock on the social market had crashed and that I would never marry . After graduation from college I moved to New York City and took a job as the administrator of a language program at the Jewish Agency . That year was perhaps the low point of my life . I was seeing a dermatologist who gave me cortisone shots in the head ; I was also taking oral prednisone daily . Now I was not only bald but had a red , swollen , moon-shaped face ? common side effects of the treatment . At a party I was dancing joyously  | with a young man I was interested in . The speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground and my wig fell off . I was n't physically hurt ? but I was paralyzed with shame . Over the next year . my life took an upturn : I found a man I wanted to marry ? and did ? and within the next few years gave birth to two beautiful ? and perfectly hairy ? children . Though my marriage would last 12 years , it seems to me now that it was doomed to fail . How can one person , not thinking herself worth much , find the love and respect to give to another ? Yet the marriage did give me strength . In the privacy of a relationship , I could reveal myself totally and know I was desired for who I was . During my marriage I discontinued all medical treatment for alopecia . I did n't want to he experimented on any more , or made hopeful . Instead I spent my money on buying new wigs . I was in " hiding " ? and my children learned the lesson I taught them : My uncovered head was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be covered up when anyone else was around . After my marriage broke up . my exhusband went to est , an intensive encounter training . The experience was so transforming for him that he wanted our children to attend too . Since they lived with me , est would n't take them unless I went first . The session would turn my life around . The first evening we were told to get in touch with our bodies by closing our eyes , feeling the sensations that were in our toes , our knees ... I could n't do it . Not only did I have no awareness of my body parts , I felt dizzy and nauseous . I knew why immediately . For 18 years I had blocked awareness of my body to avoid dealing with my hair loss . At first I felt furious at being trapped . In this intense pressure-cooker training . I would n't he able to hide my secret . That night I made up my mind : I could n't not reveal myself any longer . The next morning at est , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of 275 people . " This is the most terrifying thing I 've ever done , " I told them , " but I 'm sure nothing in my life will be right until I stop hiding . " The trainer , who had been brutal on almost everyone else , was gentle with me . I think he knew I had gotten the message I had come for . How freeing that moment felt ! You see , once you have told people your " secret , " there 's no more secret to protect . The amazing thing was that people did n't seem put off or repelled.  | They began to tell me their stories . A woman told me her daughter had had alopecia and , after seeing a wonderful doctor , now had a full head of hair . Did I want the dermatologist 's name ? I took it , but I was uncertain about letting myself hope again . It was a month before I called the doctor . After the est training , I was introduced by a friend to a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd actually talked to another person with the same condition , and it was a relief to share experiences with her . Teresa had worn a wig for about 25 years but stopped . and had begun to accent her baldness with striking clothes , makeup , and jewelry . That summer I experimented with going without my wig in public ? at a graduation ceremony . While people did stare when I walked in. the experience felt totally different from the shock of exposure at that party years before . I realized that there was more dignity in choosing to tell or show what is true about myself than in being exposed . In December 1981 , I had my first meeting with the dermatologist who had been recommended by my est friend . Thus began two years of regular treatment ? corticosteroid shots to my scalp and eyebrow line . Again , my head was swollen , but this time I actually began to grow a little hit of hair . I spent part of the summer of 1982 with dear friends in East Dubuque , III. , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again , the joys of being unencumbered by concern for my wig compensated for my embarrassment . I began consciously to make and hold eye contact with strangers . I was learning that people most often reflect back what you put out in the world . If you are comfortable with yourself , it is that serenity , not the baldness , that is most obvious . Still , when I returned home I went back to wearing my wig most of the time . The next summer was a goalpost in my life . Once again , I spent a month in East Dubuque . Due to the treatments . I now had a closely cropped head of very thin hair , and I decided to put my wig away completely . My hard-won confidence crashed when , wigless , I picked up my then 12-year-old daughter . Morissa , at her grandparents ' house in Chicago . and began the drive home to New Jersey . Morissa was absolutely shocked that I might walk around " in front of people " without my wig . As we approached our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car without putting on my wig . Finally , in a fury , I jammed the wig on my head and marched into the house . Weeks of courage-building seemed wiped away . My son Joshua , then 14 , has the gift of being calm and soothing in times of crisis . I explained to him how I had been trying to break out of my wig , how critical I felt that it was to do that . While I could n't force this odd-looking self on him and Morissa , I needed them to support me because I was so frightened myself . ( It was not Morissa I was angry at , but the " old me " she reflected . ) Joshua let me know that he felt fine about the way I looked without the wig , and he suggested that I sit down and tell Morissa just what I had told him . My mature , wise son thought that my " limited " hair might even be an instant litmus test for Morissa of her friends ' integrity . The next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important it had become to free myself of the inhibiting wig , how I needed her strength . By the time we were done talking . we were both crying . Morissa gave me her support : I could stop wearing a wig . Now the only obstacle was myself ... . I 'll never forget the terror and relief of those first encounters with acquaintances and friends as they met the " new  | me . " Those difficult firsts never end , but the terror subsides . Again , people give me back a reflection of what I put out ? if I am at ease with myself , they quickly ask me what they need to know ( no , I do n't have cancer , I 'm not a Buddhist or an Orthodox Jew ) . I answer their questions with a smile , grateful that we 've bridged the distance between us . Many times strangers come up to me and tell me their most intimate secrets . Apparently they perceive me as already having shared my intimate secret , inviting them to do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my friend . Arthur . a well-known author , teacher , and political leader of our community . He and I had become good friends in the past year , and he had seen my head without a wig several times . Now , my wig Finally off , our love affair began . He clearly liked the woman out of hiding better than the " hiding " one . On June 22 , 1986 we were married . During my long struggle with alopecia , I had become active in a self-help group , the New York City chapter of the National Alopecia Foundation . At support meetings . I invite people to share one of the most painful experiences that has come from their hair loss . Then I ask then to share what good has come out of it . The question is usually met with stunned silence at first . Then someone speaks about having reached a deeper level of love and understanding for people who look " different . " I believe that my baldness has done just that ? cut through the mask of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself and others . Of course , there have been setbacks . I continued to take the corticosteroid shots . While new hairs began to grow , old ones fell out . In addition , my skin began to have one eruption after the other . A growth on one of my eyelids was the final straw in a series of minor crises . In March 1984 I decided to discontinue the shots . As a result , what hair I had fell out . I cried and raged . Though friends insisted there was hardly any difference between " a little hair " and no hair , I felt the difference profoundly . A critical moment came several weeks before my daughter 's Bat Mitzvah . With my hair falling out , I had avoided going shopping for a dress because I hated the idea of standing in front of mirrors . Finally , I put the wig on once again . But this time I met a wall of resistance from my two children , who assured me I looked terrible with the wig and fine without it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacular dress ? the first of what would he a number of purchases to suit the new , more dramatic me . Since that day , more than three years ago , the wig has held out no temptations . There have been moments , though , when it has felt right and necessary to go back to some form of " hiding . " I 've learned that not everyone understands my baldness . I have to consider others ' reactions . When I attended a women 's conference in Los Angeles , for instance , some people thought my head had been shaved as a statement protesting the conventional forms of women 's attractiveness ! Thereafter , I decided that in situations where people could see me as someone who was " normal " and healthy and not a political banner , I would uncover myself ? at work , at home , at my friends ' homes . In all other places I would " cover my nakedness " by wearing a scarf or a hat . My experience has taught me that " looking different " opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It encourages us to be who we are and not who we think we are supposed to he . And that , I believe , is what each of us wants most ? to be seen and known on the outside as we know ourselves to be on the inside . The challenge for each of us is to stop masking our uniqueness and to bless the opportunities ? like my loss of hair ? that allow us to be ourselves .
