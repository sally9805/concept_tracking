When a subdued Geraldine Ferraro announced in December that she would not run for the U.S. Senate from New York this year , she put the blame on an unresolved Justice Department investigation into her finances . " If this investigation were still pending , the issue would be Geraldine Ferraro , " she said . Now Ferraro , the 1984 Democratic vice-presidential candidate , may soon have her name cleared . Justice Department spokesmen disclosed last week that the investigation is all but complete and that Ferraro will apparently be cleared of any wrongdoing . The probe has concentrated on allegations that her husband John Zaccaro made illegal contributions to her first congressional campaign , in 1978 , and that Ferraro acted improperly when she failed to report on her husband 's business dealings in a financial-disclosure statement she made as a Congresswoman . <P> While the inquiry must still be reviewed by top Justice officials , it should be completed and released in a few weeks . " Someone could still go out and turn something up in an interview , " said a Justice Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely . " It remains to be seen whether Ferraro will revoke her " final and unequivocal " decision to stay out of the 1986 race .
