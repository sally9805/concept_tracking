Thatcher calls a snap election <P> The campaign will be brief , but the election will present British voters with their starkest choice in a half-century . Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has steered her Conservative Party hard to the right over the past four years . At the same time , the Labor Party , under the lackluster and ineffectual leadership of Michael Foot , offers a platform that is more leftist than ever before . The Social Democratic Party/Liberal Alliance , which is competing in general elections for the first time , adds a new element of uncertainty to the contest . Said Labor M.P . Tony Benn : " This is going to be the most fundamental election campaign we have ever fought in our lives . " <P> Thatcher 's announcement last week of new elections caught even some of her closest aides by surprise . But once she had made the decision , she wasted not a moment . By breakfast time Monday , she had informed her Cabinet . Shortly after noon , she drove to Buckingham Palace to tell Queen Elizabeth II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prime Minister had called general elections for June 9 , nearly a year before her five-year term was up . <P> As Thatcher 's senior advisers had pointed out to her in a weekend meeting at Chequers , the Prime Minister 's country estate , she is in a stronger position than any other British political leader since World War II . The latest MORI ( Market and Opinion Research International ) poll showed the Conservatives ahead with 49% , compared with 34% for the Labor Party and 15% for the Social Democratic Party/Liberal Alliance . Thatcher would have preferred to hold elections later in the fall or even next year , but her advisers urged her not to delay . Local elections a week earlier had confirmed recent polls showing that the Labor Party was picking up strength . Inflation , now down to nearly 4% , is expected to rise again later in the year . <P> Labor 's Foot derided the Prime Minister for her " irresolute rush " to elections and charged that " care and compassion had been thrown out the window " during her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party more time to close the rift between its radical left and moderate wings . But there was also grumbling among some Tory M.P.s , who noted that the party had not even selected its candidates in 20 constituencies . In fact , the 31-day campaign will interfere with several important international meetings . Thatcher promptly canceled talks with President Reagan in Washington on May 27 . But she still planned to attend the seven-nation economic summit in Williamsburg , Va. , from May 28 to 30 . <P> The fact that the opposition is divided is a major plus for the Tories . But both Labor and the Alliance will argue that Britain 's economy is far worse as a result of Thatcher 's four years in office . Unemployment now stands at 13.6%-21A times the level when she took office-and it is sure to rise during the coming year . Labor has called for a $17.5 billion reflation of the economy to create jobs , a prospect that frightens some moderate economists , while the Alliance is proposing a more restrained program of government spending to boost the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 15 years , and the government 's tough , antistrike policy has tamed the trade unions .
