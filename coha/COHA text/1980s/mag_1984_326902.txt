Hackers face tough new laws <P> State and federal officials are trying to stem a rising tide of computer mischief . But they are finding it hard to make their punishments fit the crimes . Many of the best-publicized pranks have been committed by minors who are protected from the full force of the law . Moreover , the laws are often inadequate to deal with the complexities of the new technology . In March two members of Milwaukee 's 414 Gang of computer whiz kids , which last summer broke into computers at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the Los Alamos National Laboratory , pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of making obscene or harassing phone calls . Maximum sentence for each charge : six months in jail and a $500 fine . <P> The trouble is that Wisconsin , like most states , is trying to fight 20th century crime with 19th century laws . Electronic mail , automatic funds-transfer systems and interlocking networks of high-speed computers are protected by legal concepts that were developed to safeguard paper documents . " In the old days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Richard Guilmette , manager of corporate security for Prime Computer . " Now you need fast fingers and a small computer . " <P> In the absence of specific federal laws aimed at computer criminals , nearly two dozen states have passed a series of conflicting and ineffective statutes . " It 's a terrible patchwork of law , " says Donn Parker , a computer-crime expert at SRI International . " Sometimes the results have been disastrous . " According to a recent estimate , only one in 33 reported computer crimes results in a conviction . <P> Now , however , laws tailored to punish high-tech criminals are beginning to make their way onto the books . The Massachusetts legislature is considering a model measure , prepared with the help of local computer experts , that spells out crimes in precise technical terms and calls for tough penalties : for example , $5,000 fines and up to a year in jail for hackers who crack security codes just for the fun of it , triple damages for persons found guilty of malicious tampering . The California legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , enacted in 1979 , by stiffening penalties for browsing through a computer system without permission . <P> Most state laws are aimed at malefactors who use computers to commit such conventional crimes as robbery and embezzlement . The Massachusetts and California bills are directed primarily at computer trespassers and criminals who deal in data , not dollars . These misdeeds range from changing school grades to deleting invoices in stores and altering credit-rating information . Other data-based crimes involve the theft of mailing lists , which can be copied and then sold , and the pilfering of oil-company drilling results , which can be worth millions to a competing firm . Today on some computer networks , credit card numbers are traded like baseball cards , along with telephone codes that let people tie into computer systems all across the country without paying long-distance charges . Estimates of the cost of such crimes range from hundreds of millions to several billions of dollars each year .
