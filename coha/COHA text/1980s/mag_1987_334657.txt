During Ronald Reagan 's intensive press-conference preparations , the tensest moment came on Thursday afternoon in the family theater of the White House . In the course of a two-hour practice session , Roman Popadiuk , a Foreign Service officer on loan to the press office , began boring in on Iranscam . The object was to make certain that Reagan would stay consistent , no matter how sharp the cross-examination . Popadiuk got so caught up in his role as a Sam Donaldson stand-in that Press Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater began to worry . " I thought we might all get kicked out , " he said . " It was pretty tough stuff . " Reagan hung in , however , a bit unsteady at times but improving . <P> The preparations started some ten days earlier when Executive agencies were asked to provide background information . Fitzwater 's aides then spent two days boiling down a foot-high stack of material into a 31-page summary for the President to read over the weekend at Camp David . Only after Reagan and Nancy returned and said that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to schedule the conference . <P> On Monday Chief of Staff Howard Baker and Iranscam Counselor David Abshire held an hour-long session with the President that focused on eight basic issues raised by the Tower commission report . The next morning Reagan was given what one aide called the " 50 nastiest , dirtiest questions that could be dreamed up " about Iranscam . That afternoon he discussed them with Baker and Abshire . <P> Two-hour practice sessions on the day before and the afternoon of the press conference are the heart of the preparation . As mock inquisitors grill him , top aides take notes and critique the answers with Reagan afterward . This time , his senior staff came to a startling realization : it had been so long since he had last held a press conference that virtually none of them had ever been in on the preparations . " We had to put in an urgent call to ask Ed Meese over here so we 'd have a little experience , " said one top staffer . <P> During Larry Speakes ' tenure as spokesman , aides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondents in advance . " We discovered what reporters have known for years , " boasts one former staff member , " that if you ask enough , some people will actually tell you . It 's hilarious . " This time the dominance of Iranscam reduced the need for pressroom espionage . <P> Wednesday 's rehearsal was a no-nonsense affair : Reagan was asked 36 mock questions , 30 of them on Iran and related issues . ( Every question asked at the real press conference , claims an aide , was among those asked at the first practice session . ) He answered in a straightforward way , avoiding the jokes he sometimes tells to entertain his audience . " I was really nervous until practice today , " said one staffer that afternoon . " The President is on target ; he 'll do fine . " The aide then knocked on wood .
