An old hand dispenses sturdy advice to keyboard novices <P> Personal-computer books , that enormous subindustry spawned a few years ago , are becoming increasingly literate . No longer do they require a graduate course in electronics to be understood . Few , however , make a pretense of being much more than manuals . They are aimed mostly at guiding potential buyers through the aisles of computer stores or piloting novice users around the new keyboard . <P> Now comes a new book that promises to help owners integrate computers into their lives intellectually , emotionally and practically : Electronic Life ( Knopf ; 211 pages ; $12.95 ) . Author Michael Crichton is no self-anointed microprocessor guru but the Harvard Medical School graduate turned bestselling author ( The Andromeda Strain ) and movie director ( Coma , The Great Train Robbery ) . It turns out that Crichton is also a computer expert of sorts . He wrote his senior thesis at Harvard in 1963 on a mainframe and has since created a computer adventure game and designed software programs for cost analysis and shooting-schedule planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , richton found himself a growing source of advice and information for friends who wanted assistance with their new Apples and Commodores . He claims that he produced the book so that he would no longer feel like the " help " button on a computer keyboard . <P> But Crichton aims at far more than simple hand holding . It is his conviction that just as computers have changed his own work life , they will change the very existence of almost everyone else . He believes the eventual impact of the computer will surpass that of the telephone and the automobile . To the author , the important issue is : " ' Am I going to be able to get through the rest of my life without a practical ability to use computers ? ' The answer is almost certainly ' No . ' My sense is that most people are n't going to have the choice of : ' Will I or wo n't I get involved with computers ? ' Even if it 's just with an electronic teller at the bank , everybody is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be O.K. to be afraid . " <P> That said , Crichton manages to create a believable human framework for micromachines . Electronic Life is a casual , alphabetized guidebook , with a brief initiation into high-tech jargon ( RAM , ROM , kilobyte ) and arcana ( magnetic fields , artificial intelligence and dedicated machines ) . The process is reassuring for the technophobic . " Fear of computers is normal , " writes Crichton . " A certain amount of kicking and screaming is useful . " <P> The book 's great virtue is common sense . It recommends that no computer should be bought on the promise of what will be available next week or next month , because such promises are seldom kept . A new machine or program should not be purchased until it has been thoroughly tested and the bugs removed . And the author gently reproves old computer hands irritated by the latest category of social bore , the newly minted fanatic . After all , today 's veterans were once zealots.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
