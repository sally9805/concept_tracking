The news was an eerie echo of the 1979-81 Iranian hostage crisis . The State , Department confirmed last week that Joe Pattis , 49 , an American in Iran , had been arrested there on espionage charges . Pattis , an employee of Cosmos Engineers of Bethesda , Md. , was reportedly working at Iran 's state-run telecommunications center at Assadabad shortly before Iraqi jets bombed the facility ; Iranian suspicion that Pattis was connected with the bombing apparently led to his arrest . <P> State Department officials said the Swiss government , which represents U.S. interests in Iran , had been denied the right to meet with Pattis . In Aiken , S.C. , the engineer 's sister Ellen described him as a " very quiet , private " person who would never be involved in spying . Pattis is one of an estimated 2,000 Americans living in Iran .
