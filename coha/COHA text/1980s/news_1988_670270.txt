The television commercial opens with the sound of voices droning and dishes clinking in a chic Manhattan cafe . Panning around the room , the camera eavesdrops on the gossipy prattle of the diners . " She ' s lived here for two years , and she thinks she ' s such a New Yorker , " one woman snipes . At another table , a woman cranes her neck and cries out , " Is that who I think it is ? " The camera moves in such a jerky fashion that the images , as well as the dialogue , seem out of focus . The marketing focus of the ad isn ' t easy to discern , either . In fact , it doesn ' t become clear until the tail end of the spot . " My friends are always complaining about their banks , " a woman says . " I don ' t know what they ' re talking about . " Then the following words flash on the screen : " The personal banker bank . Irving Trust . " Irving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , which began airing the commercial last month , says it has a good reason for making the ad so hard to fathom . For the spot to succeed , it needs to stand out from the pack of other ads that also are hyping personal banking service . Increasingly , banks are running ads portraying themselves as caring institutions that deliver impeccable service . The banks hope these ads will help them overcome the notion that they are cold and insensitive . Not coincidentally , the ads are arriving at a time when many of their customers are demanding better service . Some recent consumer surveys even show that people now consider quality service more important than convenient location when it comes to picking a bank . " Banks have all done market research and found general dissatisfaction among consumers , " says Chris Goodrich , senior vice president of Earle Palmer Brown &; Spiro , a Philadelphia ad agency . Now they " want to seem more human and empathetic . " The banks are off to a bad start . Marketing consultants say most image ads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers have become too cynical about banks to be taken in by platitudes . " You ' re swimming upstream when you talk about being the friendly banker , " says Stephen Weinstein , president of Weinstein Otterman &; Associates , an ad agency in New York . " It ' s about as believable as saying you ' re a painless dentist . " Judging from most of these image ads , banks have replaced dogs as man ' s best friend . Two typical slogans are " We hear you , " from Philadelphia ' s First Pennsylvania Bank , a unit of First Pennsylvania Corp. , and " We put you first , " from First National Bank of Chicago , a unit of First Chicago Corp . Then there ' s the commercial from Trustcorp Bank , Toledo , Ohio , a unit of Trustcorp Inc . " The last thing I ever want to do is intimidate a customer , " a handsome young banker assures viewers . " I ' m an investor . I invest in people . " Some marketing professionals also complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the Midwest , for example , Banc One Corp . , Columbus , Ohio , asserts in ads that it employs " 18 , 000 people who care , " while First National Bank of Louisville , Ky. , a unit of National City Corp. , is running ads stating that " there are more than 1 , 900 of us . . . who have pledged to work harder for you . " Even some banks question the effectiveness of such fuzzy , soft-sell spots . Earlier this year , for example , Security Pacific National Bank , Los Angeles , a unit of Security Pacific Corp. , aired a commercial in which a little boy frets about his poor report card until his understanding father shows him an old , equally poor report card of his own ; the connection with banking is that people also need " understanding " from their financial institutions . Currently , Security Pacific is trying to figure out if its image campaign was a success and is running only product ads , for such things as home-equity loans . Nonetheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising . And some say they are trying to come up with ads that do break creative ground . Irving Trust , for example . " We wanted to try a sophisticated documentary approach and spend most of the time in the commercial setting up a very New York scene , " says James Foster , president of Brouillard Communications Inc. , the bank ' s New York ad agency . First Chicago also is steering clear of such things as euphorically happy tellers . " Real " is its buzzword . In each commercial ( or " documonial , " as the bank calls it ) , an actor playing a First Chicago customer relates a personal story . In one , a young man sits in a garage talking about the loan he just received for a 1957 Corvette . " The first time I ever saw a ' 57 ' Vette , I knew I had to have one , " he says . " It was a lotta money then , and I was only 10 . " In another ad , a woman relaxing in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Chicago . " But hey , who thinks about switching checking accounts ? You know , it ' s one of those things you do , and you forget about , like getting married , " she says . " The commercials tell stories in an awkward , sometimes self-conscious way , " says Lis Slattery , management director at Foote , Cone &; Belding , First Chicago ' s ad agency . " We ' re trying to humanize the monolith without simply saying we ' re caring folks . That kind of talk falls on deaf ears . " In Texas , meanwhile , Gibraltar Savings Association , a unit of First Texas Financial Corp. in Dallas , is counting on the power of music to drive its new campaign . The song of choice is " Stand by Me , " an oldie by Ben E. King . One of the ads shows a Gibraltar customer 43 years ago as a World War II bomber pilot and today at a reunion with his wartime buddies . The tag is , " Gibraltar Savings . Like Good Friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The song really had stopping power and created a warm , good feeling among the people in our consumer research studies , " says Roy Spence , president of GSD &; Advertising , the ad agency for Gibraltar . " ' Stand by Me ' is especially appropriate since these aren ' t the best times for the Texas economy . " While catchy songs and visual images may get attention , some marketers think banks would do better to back up their talk about service with guarantees . A number of banks already are using the tactic . In New York , for example , National Westminster Bank , a unit of National Westminster Bank PLC , promises to give $5 to customers who aren ' t treated courteously and $50 to anyone whose loan request isn ' t answered as promptly as promised . But for some people , such guarantees are simply an indication of just how bad bank service has become . Says Carol Colman , a partner at Inferential Focus , a New York consumer-research firm : " Now people have to be bribed to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too small to matter to most people , especially in an expensive city like New York . National Westminster says so far it has given out only a " negligible amount . " Meanwhile , PlainsBank of Illinois , a unit of Plains Financial Corp . , Des Plaines , may have the best idea of all for attracting service-conscious customers . The bank is running an " At-Your-Service " sweepstakes and giving away prizes designed to make the winners feel pampered . The prizes don ' t have anything to do with banking . Instead , they include such things as a year of maid service , 26 weeks of car washes , three months of laundry service and catered breakfasts in bed .
