Sometimes it 's the little things that count . How little ? In San Diego last week U.S. Customs agents seized Atlantis II , an $80 million research vessel once used to explore the wrack of the Titanic , after a routine search turned up traces of pot in the shaving kit of a crew member along with two marijuana pipes . The ship was returned , but only when its owner , the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , agreed to send Customs officials a letter supporting the antidrug campaign and promising to tighten security . Zero tolerance strikes again . <P> Even as some Americans were asking whether drugs should be legalized , a Reagan Administration under fire for fumbling the drug war was pushing penalties to unheard of lengths . Zero tolerance , as the two-month-old policy is called , directs the Coast Guard , Customs Service and other arms of the Federal Government to enforce existing laws to the utmost degree . That means seizing vehicles , boats and planes if just a speck of any controlled substance is found on board . By last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveyances , including the $2.5 million yacht Ark Royal and the good ship Monkey Business , famed as the holiday vessel of Gary Hart and Donna Rice . Those two ships were also returned , but the fate of hundreds of less celebrated transports still hangs in the balance . <P> Laws that permit federal authorities to confiscate criminal assets have been used with great success in recent years to hit Mafia bosses and drug dealers where it hurts  --  in their profits . But the law allows government agencies to carry out " administrative seizures " that do not require the owner to be convicted of any crime . Police and federal agents in New York City and Los Angeles have been using that method to impound the cars of drive-in drug buyers whose purchases would bring merely a misdemeanor charge in court . U.S. Customs Commissioner William von Raab , who proposed zero tolerance to the White House drug-policy board after a successful pilot program in San Diego , says its purpose is likewise to put pressure on drug users who ordinarily are not reached by criminal penalties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Von Raab , " because people are n't being prosecuted . " <P> Even among those charged with executing the antidrug measures , however , the string of government seizures can seem excessive and unfair , especially when they involve owners who may have had no idea that drugs were on board . " Say my kids go out and one of their friends leaves a roach in the ashtray , " says Joseph McNamara , chief of the San Jose police department . " How would I know ? " Federal agencies often return property when owners can show they knew nothing about the drugs involved , but they are not obliged to . And the rules that govern agency hearings are different from those that prevail in a courtroom : it is up to the accused to prove their innocence . " We have a rule in American jurisprudence that the penalty fits the crime , " says Colleen O'Connor of the American Civil Liberties Union . " Confiscation of millions of dollars in property for a joint does n't fit . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
