Once a quiet farming community and get-away for Chicagoans , Algonquin is now confronted by a booming population and rapidly encroaching neighbors . The growth of this McHenry County town-to more than 10 , 000 residents from fewer than 4 , 000 in 1976-has elected officials asking each other just where the community is headed and how it is going to pay the mounting bills along the way . To answer those questions , trustees are considering hiring a professional planner . " We ' re old enough to have a rich history , but we ' re new enough to learn from the rapid growth of others and not make the same mistakes , " said Village President Donald Brewer . In an informal meeting recently , village officials listened to Lee Brown , consultant for Teska Associates Inc. , of Evanston , outline what a planner could do for the village . Brown is one of three planners the board is interviewing with an eye to devising a comprehensive plan for the village , something some of its neighbors already have . " There ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ready for it , " Brown told officials . But while the Village Board and the Plan Commision are ready to develop a comprehensive plan for the village , neither seems to know quite where they want the Fox River Valley community to be five years from now . They do know growth in far northwest suburban McHenry County is inevitable , and uppermost in their minds is protecting the village ' s borders , particularly to the west . " It ' s a land grab out there , " said Trustee Tom Schober , noting that neighboring Lake in the Hills was forced to take in a development or risk having its western border blocked from any further growth . By law , villages may annex land within 1 1/2 miles of their borders and continue to annex land until they are up to another village ' s borders , Brown said . That can lead to " bloody and costly " battles between towns , he told the officials , unless agreements can be reached . Although Brewer has no definite plans for the land surrounding Algonquin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from annexing land right up to Algonquin and sealing it off from expansion . " I think Crystal Lake will continue to grow , and I think we have a duty to our citizenry to not let that happen . It would landlock you the way Hoffman Estates engulfed Palatine , " Brewer said . Village officials foresee even greater growth with Sears , Roebuck &; Co ' s relocation of its Merchandise Group headquarters to Hoffman Estates and the office development taking place on Randall Road west of Elgin . " When I moved here seven years ago , I wanted to move west of O ' Hare ( International Airport ) , and I think people who come to work at Sears will want to live west of where they work , not east , " Trustee Schober said . " When they leave work , people want to get away from it all . " But that ' s getting harder to do in Algonquin . Rush-hour traffic seems to be backed up farther and farther at the busy downtown interesection of Ill . Hwys. 31 and 62 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to build a bypass bridge across the river to relieve some of the traffic have bogged down in disputes over where the bridge should be and what it would cost . Right now , planning in the village is done by the trustees and volunteers , serving on committees . Though the hands-on style of governing may have served the village in the past , Brewer says it ' s time the village moved beyond that . He ' d like to see trustees relinquish some of their decision-making powers and move to set policy instead . Brown concurred . " You ' re moving into a position of staff serving the committees . As you grow in complexity , there ' s no other way to handle it , " he said . Although that ' s not always easy for village governments to accept , Brewer said , it may be the only way for Algonquin to keep up with the fast-paced development in the area . " We need to respond to growth , not react to it , " Brewer said.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
