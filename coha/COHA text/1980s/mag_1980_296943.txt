A haven for refugees turns into a place of terror <P> Behind the barbed wire and chain-link fences at Fort McCoy , in the bucolic farm land of western Wisconsin , young Hispanic men have stripped off their shirts because of the sweltering summer heat . But when asked what the 5,000 Cuban refugees at the sprawling Army base need most , Tmas Rodriguez , president of their governing council , replies : " Warm clothing for the cold weather that is coming . " Has he no hope , then , that most of them will be resettled before winter ? " No , " answers Rodriguez . " If we were to say yes , we would be fooling ourselves . " <P> Chances are that he is right . Fort McCoy once was the gateway to a new life for Cubans fleeing Fidel Castro 's island ; almost 10,000 have passed through and been placed with American sponsors . Now it is a kind of prison , an extreme example of the difficulties the U.S. faces in assimilating the last of the 120,000 Cubans who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reasons for the despair that has driven a handful of refugees to hijack American airliners to Havana . The seventh U.S. hijacking in 26 days occurred last week . <P> The Cubans still at Fort McCoy are a hard-core remnant of the boatlift . More than 90% of them are single men aged 18 to 35 with no relatives in the U.S. , few job skills and no knowledge of English ; many are barely literate even in Spanish . Some came from Cuban jails or mental hospitals . Among the inmates are 266 juveniles under 18 who are caught in a bureaucratic snarl .

Nor can the youths be enrolled in foster-care programs even if they have relatives living in the U.S. ; if the teen-agers need long-term counseling , as many may , and the foster parents can not provide it , the financial burden would fall on a state .

Barely a week goes by without a stabbing incident ; there are repeated reports of homosexual and heterosexual rape . Fear of revenge keeps most of the victims from complaining to camp authorities . Monroe County Circuit Court Judge James W. Rice says that one boy who appeared in his court seeking release from the camp " told me that he had a knife held to his throat by a group of older boys . They demanded that he commit a homosexual act . " The youth was sent to live with relatives in Florida . Some Cubans also have slashed themselves to gain admittance to the safety of the camp hospital . One young man with deep knife cuts in his left forearm told TIME Correspondent Steven Holmes : " I did it to myself , to get attention . "                @ @ @ @ @
