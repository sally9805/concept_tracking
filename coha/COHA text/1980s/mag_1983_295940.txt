A close call for the jobs bill <P> On its face , the action of the freshman Republican Senator from Wisconsin was callously opportunistic . He was endangering passage of a bill that would extend unemployment benefits to jobless workers in 27 states and create an estimated 400,000 jobs . In behalf of the nation 's well-heeled banking lobby , he hung an amendment on the jobs bill that would cancel the scheduled July 1 start of the withholding of 10% of income from interest and dividends . This is a reform designed to reduce tax cheating and raise nearly $11 billion in revenue in the next three years . Said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Robert Dole : " This pits the truly needy versus the truly greedy . " <P> At first , it looked as if Senator Robert Kasten would succeed , aided by what Dole angrily termed " the most massive campaign in history to intimidate Congress . " The bankers had bombarded legislators with more than 1 million anti-withholding letters , most of them prewritten , preaddressed and with stamps supplied by the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause . In response , Dole resorted to a filibuster to prevent Kasten 's rider from passing . <P> At one point , Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker drew Kasten into his office for a scolding . Kasten began to weaken , but said he would have to talk strategy with Jesse Helms , the ultraconservative North Carolina Republican . There were Senators who suspected Helms was aiding Kasten just as the fox helped the gingerbread man , i.e. , Helms was really out to kill the jobs bill . President Reagan had vowed to veto the bill if the rider reached his desk as part of it . <P> The pressure mounted on Kasten . The bankers ' lobbying was assailed by editorialists from coast to coast . Dole indicted the bankers on national television for " using the big-lie technique . They 've been telling people that we 're going to loot their savings accounts , pick their pockets , take away their savings . " <P> Dole failed by ten votes to kill Kasten 's rider ; Kasten failed by only one vote to end Dole 's filibuster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat from Senate Republican leaders and agreed to withdraw his rider , in return for a promise that he could attach it to trade legislation due to come up for action next month . The Senate then quickly passed the jobs bill ; the $5.1 billion appropriation must now be reconciled with the $4.9 billion House version .
