txt CAR SALES in Detroit are terrible . Everyone is worried about it because , as we all know , as goes General Motors , so cues the nation . In my view , there is just one solution to the problem . If new car sales are to improve , old cars are going to have to start falling apart even faster than they do now . The answer is salt . A few hundred thousand tons more salt on our roads would substantially hasten the day when each of us has to buy a new car . The automobile industry can come up w'th new names for its cars , new style hubcaps , and they could even put tiny disposals in their ashtrays . but they are never going to find a more effective way to get as to buy new cars than by putting more salt on the roads . IN 1976 , a federally funded study estimated that we spend $2.7 billion a year on the damages done by salt spread on our roads to melt ice and snow . A study done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage a year to every car in that country . These are the kinds of statistics from which car sales are made ! Why , then , are we limiting the salting of our highways to the winter months ? Why do we only put salt down when there is ice and snow ? If every major city in America began a program of year-round salting , car sales would increase dramatically . Cars would be rotting oul right and left . Brake lines would go , electrical systems would short out , mufflers would go quicker , and gas tank straps Would cur rode and give way . LAST YEAR , New York City alone spread 166,938 tons of salt on its streets . It produced one of the greatest pothole crops in the history of mankind 's paved streets . It would be hard to estimate the good these frame-rattling craters did for the auto repair business in the city . If 25,000 cars had to have repairs averaging $200 apiece , this means that $5,000,000 was pumped into the economy . It is not only the automobile industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salt helps destroy water mains burled beneath our streets , thus providing increased overtime for municipal employes and public utilities workers . Nurseries across the land would profit . Nothing kills trees and shrubs along the roadside like a good dose of NaCi . The replacement jobs provided to garden ? en tern and nurseries would be a shot in the arm for them . AND WHY SHOULD we limit the spreading of salt on our roads to North ern states ? Why indeed ! Are not our Southern states equal partners in this union ? They should all participate in the good things the North alone derives from salting programs . The automobileindustry itself might well consider subsidizing. salt-spreading programs in those states which du not now have one . It might even consider the feasibility of developing a salt-based undercoating for new cars . U.S. cities currently use 10 million tons of salt on their roads every year . It is a domestically produced commodity for which we do not depend on any Middle Eastern sheikdom or ayatollandom . We should bend every effort toward doubling that figure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every ton of salt we splatter on the undercarriage of our cars is a ton of salt we do n't clog the arteries of our bodies with .
