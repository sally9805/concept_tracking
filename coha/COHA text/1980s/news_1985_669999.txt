General Motors Corp. is negotiating a wide range of partnership arrangements with Fiat S.p . A. , which broke off merger talks with Ford Motor Co. earlier this week . One possibility under discussion is a merger of GM ' s European operations with the Italian company ' s auto operations . Both GM and Fiat officials denied that such talks are being held . But sources familiar with the negotiations said the No. 1 U.S. auto maker , which made the initial overtures to Fiat , held its first meeting with top Fiat officials in London more than a month ago . At that time , Ford and Fiat were still talking  --  but their discussions were approaching a deadlock . Fiat announced Tuesday that after more than a year of negotiations with Ford the Italian auto maker couldn ' t agree on the financial structuring and management of a merged company . The sources said " relatively high-level officials " of the two companies are involved in the discussions . One source said that from the GM side , negotiations are being conducted by officials in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underscoring the seriousness of GM ' s intention to form some form of partnership with the Italian auto maker . The two companies , however , are " a long way " from sitting down " to trade horses , " the sources said . GM apparently aims to achieve the same sort of goals its Detroit rival sought in linking up with Fiat . There is tremendous overcapacity in Europe , which has led to heavy price discounting and narrow profit margins for both the European and U.S. auto makers who sell there . They need to slash capacity and consolidate efficient operations and share development and marketing costs in order to be profitable . GM , unlike Ford , either has been losing money or barely breaking even in Europe for the past few years . Fiat , on the other hand , has been " a vicious and successful " costs cutter and has been a profitable auto company in Europe , says one auto expert . " That ' s where GM can learn most from Fiat . " GM ' s desire to join with Fiat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s push to increase its presence in the European market , where GM sells cars through its Adam Opel unit in West Germany and its Vauxhall Motors unit in Britain . About five years ago , GM decided to increase sales in Europe , the largest auto market outside North America , in light of projected lackluster growth in the U.S. GM increased its share of the European market to 11. 2% last year from 8. 3% in 1981 . But it faces tough competition from four other major players  --  Ford , Fiat , Volkswagen AG and Peugeot S.A.  --  who each have around 12% of the market . Any link with Fiat would offer GM a major presence in Italy , where the U.S. auto maker accounts for less than 2% of the market . It would also allow GM to consolidate distribution networks with Fiat ' s dealerships in other parts of Europe . For Fiat , GM holds an opening into auto markets outside Europe , particularly the U.S. Fiat , faced with mounting quality and distribution problems , withdrew from the U.S. some years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a partnership with GM . Last week , Fiat managing director Cesare Romiti predicted sharp growth for the Italian company ' s non-automotive business  --  including Comau S.p . A. , which makes robots for auto production , and telecommunication and aviation units . GM recently bought Hughes Aircraft Co. and Electronic Data Systems Corp. , which could have implications for Fiat ' s non-automotive operations . But GM faces most of the same problems Ford encountered in merger talks with Fiat . The Italian company didn ' t want to take a subordinate role in the financial structure or in the management of the merged company . GM is a much larger company than Ford and is even more likely to seek a dominant role in any arrangements . " Who heads the new company ? Who decides which plants to close down and which to expand and what car to build ? These complications could create big roadblocks , " said one industry expert .
