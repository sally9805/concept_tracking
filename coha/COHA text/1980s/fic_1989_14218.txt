( AS THE LIGHTS FADE UP , we see the interior of Delicacies Restaurant . Stage Right we see the entrance to the restaurant , and a podium . Stage Left we see a single table with a white tablecloth , and chairs for six . There are stark touches of elegance in the setting : an orchid arrangement here , a piece of artwork hung there . Classical harp music can be heard in the background . The name of the restaurant is etched in glass on the door , and the shadow of this name falls across the podium , denoting sunset . The door opens and two women enter . MERYL , quite agitated , is elegantly dressed in a black silk jumpsuit and looks around the entry with jerky , furtive movements . KATE , in a longer , flowing , feminine dress , tries to calm MERYL down . They stand near the podium . ) MERYL We should n't be doing this . We can leave now and no one will ever know . ( Paces , nervously sits , paces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got here . MERYL We ca n't go through with this . I 'll just die if someone sees us . What if Ted 's boss comes in or the catsitter or Ted 's mother or  --  KATE This was your idea , Meryl Sugarman . MERYL Was it ? p. 3 KATE ( Imitating ) Was it ? Oh , yes it was . Last week you said you 'd like to meet these men we liked so much . And it was a great idea . We all agreed . MERYL Talking about it and doing it are completely different things . KATE Stand still for a minute . You 're giving me whiplash . MERYL Stand still ? Are you crazy ? God , this makes me so  --  incredibly  --  nervous  --  We 've got to get out of here while we can . KATE We are not getting out of here . Glenda is on her way here , and the guys MERYL The guys How can you call them that ? The guys ? Oh , God  --  I 'm sweating so much all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after I left the clinic , but Doc Clemens says animals always mark a sinner and I feel marked  --  - KATE Meryl , for Christ 's sake . We have n't even done anything yet . We have n't sinned . It 's only dinner . MERYL How did I ever get Derek into this mess ? KATE Yours is named Derek ? And he 's a vet , too ? MERYL Yes . Yes , he 's a vet , too . Especially good with rabbits . Gentle hands p. 4 KATE Michael 's got gentle hands , too . MERYL Okay . Yours is Michael . What does he do ? KATE He 's a P. D. Public Defender . MERYL You 're bringing the law here , to this ? I may puke God , why are we doing this ? KATE For fun . Because we deserve it . Because we 've lost sense of how to have it . And these men make us laugh . MERYL But  --  we 're  --  all  --  married  --  Katie  --  ( MAITRE D ' enters from kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delicacies . May I help you ? KATE Yes . We have a reservation . MERYL That 's an understatement . MAITRE D ' Your name ? KATE I do n't know . ( Looks at MERYL ) MERYL ( Shrugging ) Glenda made the reservations . For 6 o'clock . KATE ( To MAITRE D ' ) Is there a MacIntyre party ? MAITRE D ' ( Checking ) No. p. 5 KATE Is there a Sugarman party ? MAITRE D ' No . MERYL Is there a Wagner party ? MAITRE D ' No . We do have a Beach party . For six . At six . KATE Beach party ? MAITRE D ' A Beach party . For six . At six . With a request to be near a certain painting MERYL ( To MAITRE D ' ) Well , that 's probably us . Our friend is a sculptor and quite artsy MAITRE D ' You 're sure ? You 're the Beach party ? MERYL You see , that 's an old joke . MAITRE D ' We do n't seat jokes here at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , please . ( To MAITRE D ' ) If there are no other parties at six , for six , I will take personal responsibility for the risk of seating us at the Beach party 's table . MAITRE D ' As you wish . ( He takes them to SL table , near the hanging painting . KATE and MERYL sit facing out . ) MAITRE D ' Shall I bring the wine list ? p. 6 KATE Please . ( MAITRE D ' exits . KATE starts to relax . MERYL fidgets . The door opens SR and GLENDA enters , in a short miniskirt and a low-cut blouse . GLENDA looks around for a moment . Then MERYL waves . GLENDA waves and crosses to the table . ) MERYL ( Waving ) Here we are . GLENDA Hello , hello , hello . Is n't this delicious ? Are n't we naughty girls ? MERYL We 've been waiting for you to get here before we all leave . GLENDA Leave ? Not on your life . This is the best idea you 've ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be fine . ( Leans over to kiss KATE . ) Hi , Katie . Well , do n't you look nice . KATE Thank you . New skirt ? GLENDA ( Modeling it ) What do you think ? KATE Revealing . GLENDA That 's the idea with this sort of affair , is n't it ? MERYL You said it . You said the dreaded word . KATE I hope he brings the wine list soon . Meryl will be reciting the Ten Commandments and flogging herself any minute . p. 7 MERYL Excuse me for being the only one with a little guilt . Sit down , Glenda . We do n't want the Maitre D ' to suspect anything . KATE Him ? He 's certifiable . Anyway , how 'd you find this place ? GLENDA The chairman of the board at the museum . He asked me here for dinner once . Told me it was a " discreet , dark place perfect for art and artist appreciation " I turned him down . ( Fingers her wedding ring . ) I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started with the wolf stories . ( MATIRE D ' returns from SL and hands the wine list to KATE . ) MAITRE D ' Madame ? Is this another Beach ? KATE ( Taking it ) Thank you . Yes . ( MAITRE D ' eyes GLENDA and exits . ) MERYL Why did you want to be near this painting ? GLENDA It 's one of Kierran 's . MERYL Who 's Kierran ? GLENDA ( Smiling ) You know KATE We 're dining with the artist ? And he 's Irish ? How exciting ! ! p. 8 MERYL ( Groaning ) Yours is named Kierran ? I 'm never going to remember all this . ( Peers at the painting ) Besides , I do n't understand his work . ( MERYL stands to examine picture ) KATE Well , then , do n't bring it up . MERYL ( At painting ) But we 're going to have to  --  make conversation  --  - And it 's hanging right in front of our faces  --  Look at these round , pink things  --  Kind of like  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GLENDA ) Pouilly Fuisse ? To start ? GLENDA ( Nods ) Fine . ( MERYL shakes her head and sits down . ) MERYL I 'm not good at talking to strange men . Besides , you know what always happens when men are around . We all end up  --  behaving differently . GLENDA Meryl MERYL Our voices shift higher , our vocabulary shrinks , we cross our legs with great frequency Female conditioning . KATE Funny . I always thought my vocabulary expanded whenever men were around . My killer instinct I guess . p. 9 GLENDA Relax . I wo n't cross my legs a lot . Okay ? Anyway , these men are n't strange . They 're special . By the way , where are they ? ( Looks at her watch . ) It 's 6:15 already . Kierran 's always on time . KATE My friend Michael was coming from downtown . MERYL Probably just the traffic . Derek had to change after work . GLENDA ( Nodding ) Well , what 's everybody 's husband doing tonight ? As if we care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosses to the table . He frowns at GLENDA . ) MAITRE D ' Have you decided on a wine ? KATE Yes . We 'd like to start with a bottle of Pouilly Fuisse . MAITRE D ' Excellent . Have any of you Beaches ever dined with us before ? ( KATE looks at MERYL and GLENDA , then answers . ) KATE ( Coldly ) No . MAITRE D ' No . I see . And you are expecting three more ? KATE Yes . MAITRE D ' Well , let me begin your dining experience tonight at Delicacies with a little food for thought . The word " delicacy " has extensive meaning and rich connotations associated with it . It expresses the quality of being delicate as in taste , odor , or texture ( points to painting ) or a fragile beauty or graceful slightness , softness , fineness , as in the delicacy of a petal ( fingers the orchid arrangement ) , or spun glass , or a child 's face . It can mean weakness or frailty It can denote the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicacy . It means fineness of feeling , observation , or appreciation , as in the delicacy of musical taste ( He pauses to listen to harp music playing ) It shows a fineness of touch ( He holds a wine glass up to the light . ) And a fine regard for the feelings of others . It means a sensitive , almost finicky distaste for what is considered improper or offensive And of course , it means caviar , a choice food . And finally , luxuriousness ( He pauses as the three women look at each other . ) I 'll be right back with your wine . ( MAITRE D ' exits. ) p. 10 KATE That was a mental hors d'oeuvre . GLENDA Seemed more like a movable feast . MERYL He knows . He knows what we 're up to . KATE He does not . That 's a prepared speech he tells to everyone the first time they come here . It 's part of the restaurant 's ambiance . GLENDA But it was very interesting . MERYL He knows . Glenda , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our old college joke . MERYL It drew attention to us from the start . KATE So far , we 're the only ones here . MERYL But he knows . The Maitre D'knows . All he has to do is get our last names , and our marriages could be history . GLENDA Our marriages could already be history . That 's the whole point of this evening , damn it . ( A beat ) MERYL I ca n't go through with this  --  - KATE ( Emphatically ) If you 're going to whine through the whole meal , maybe you should leave . If you 're not mature enough to accept responsibility for your own feelings , if you ca n't do what you really want to do without driving yourself- and us- crazy , then maybe you should go home to Teddy . Fix some spaghetti and look at your canaries . Cry yourself to sleep . Then , think about Derek his hands . See him in your dreams , then flirt with him at work . That sounds so healthy ! ( MERYL sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay here with us . Have a little fun . We understand how you feel . But we 're all trying to move forward . This dinner is just an innocent experiment , a little adventure . KATE We 're not getting any younger . Do you want to live the rest of your life like this ? MERYL ( Quiet ) No . KATE Then just give it a try . GLENDA We love you . We want you to be happy . KATE We 're not saying have an affair . GLENDA Not yet , anyway . KATE ( Fingers her wedding ring ) We 're saying " Let 's meet these alternative men that we 're so attracted to . " And celebrate them . GLENDA Married men do this all the time . Maybe even Teddy 's done it . MERYL What ? ( MAITRE D ' enters from SL door with a bottle of wine . He holds it for KATE 's examination and listens to their conversation . The women continue , undaunted by his presence : this action continues during GLENDA 's speech . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D ' uncorks the wine , pours it for KATE . She tastes it and nods . The MAITRE D ' pours the wine for the 3 women. ) p. 12 GLENDA I 'm not saying he has . I 'm saying he could have . I 'm saying men do this kind of thing . My husband is always entertaining clients at dinner . Do you think it 's always business ? ( A pause ) Let 's relax and meet these men . Okay ? It 's only for a few hours . If it will make you feel better , we can come back here in a few weeks , with our husbands . The six of us . We have nothing to hide . How about it ? Then we can discuss golf , stocks and real estate . Does that sound dull or what ? KATE These men we 're dining with tonight are professionals , we 're professionals . We share professional interests . This is a professional dinner of the 90 's . All right , Meryl ? MERYL Okay . Okay . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KATE pats MERYL 's hand . GLENDA takes a sip of the wine . ) GLENDA This is good . ( GLENDA watches as the MAITRE D ' exits . ) You know , he 's different . Kind of handsome . ( MERYL and KATE sip the wine . ) KATE He thinks I 'm the head Beach . ( They laugh . The front door opens SR , and DEREK enters . He stands there innocently . GLENDA sees him first . ) GLENDA Someone 's here . ( KATE and MERYL strain to see. ) p. 13 MERYL ( Crouching ) God . It 's Derek . KATE ( Peering ) That 's Derek ? MERYL Do n't stare . KATE Are n't you going to wave ? GLENDA Wait . I 've got to do something first . ( She crosses her legs back and forth several times . ) KATE ( Holding her head ) Oh no . All I can think of are short words . See Jane Run . Go Spot Go . MERYL Stop it . Please . ( DEREK looks over at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KATE Nice hands . MERYL ( Feeling stronger ) Be good . I want you to like him . GLENDA I 'll say this for him . He 's here . I hope we 're not going to be stood up , Kate . KATE I 'll drink to that . But I 'm not going to be stood up . Michael is so ready to start something with me that he 'll be drooling as he walks in . GLENDA Kierran is so crazy about me that he 's asked me to pose for his next project . In the nude . p. 14 MERYL ( Watching for DEREK ) Oh God , I do n't want Derek to hear all this  --  ( DEREK enters , gingerly approaching the table . ) DEREK ( Shyly ) Hi . MERYL ( Stands up , knocks over her drink ) Oh , God ! ( Disaster : she 's very wet and her dress is now spotted . ) I do n't believe this ! Oh , God ! DEREK Oh no . Here . ( He reaches for a napkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the napkin from him . KATE AND GLENDA also scramble for napkins . The MAITRE D ' crosses to them with a stack of cloth napkins . He calmly watches . The other four help MERYL . ) GLENDA At least it 's not silk ! KATE Hold still . ( Pats her . ) GLENDA I 'll dab your hair . ( She does . ) MERYL My hair 's not wet . None of this is helping . MAITRE D ' May I suggest you retreat to the Ladies ' Room with this supply of napkins ? MERYL ( Trying to regain her dignity ) Yes . Yes . Thanks . Hi , Derek . I 'll be right back . Kate and Glenda , this is Derek . And please , please . ( She looks at KATE and GLENDA nervously ) Do n't . p. 15 MAITRE D ' This way , Madame . ( Hands her the stack of napkins . ) ( MERYL takes the stack of napkins . The MAITRE D ' motions to her and she follows him . They exit SL . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finishes wiping it off . ) DEREK Well . She was all wet . KATE Poor thing . Like she jumped in a pool . GLENDA Nothing wrong with a woman being wet . ( DEREK shifts uncomfortably . GLENDA looks him over . ) KATE ( Clearing her throat ) Please . Join us . I think it 's dry enough over here . ( KATE makes room for DEREK at the table . ) GLENDA With all the heat at this table , it 'll be dry in no time . ( KATE kicks GLENDA . ) KATE So . Derek . I 'm Kate MacIntyre . And this is Glenda Wagner . DEREK ( Shakes hands with each of them ) Nice to meet you . Again . GLENDA We 've heard so much about you . DEREK Really ? GLENDA Oh , Meryl just raves about you . p. 16 KATE She says you 're especially good with rabbits . DEREK Did she ? That 's high praise coming from Meryl . Her animal instincts are well natural . She 's a born veterinarian . Did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a miracle . A woman called at 11:17 a.m . She was in hysterics . She said her pet Gila monster was dying , that the lizard had been outside under a bush and just went over on its side , like this ( He mimes a movement with his hands ) . And opened its mouth , and was lying there . ( He mimes a movement with his tongue , suggesting exhaustion . ) The woman started screaming and threw water on it , tried to get it to drink , and called us sobbing , asking what to do . Meryl was so calm , and told her to bring the critter in as quickly as possible . Meryl was ready with a stimulant and the Gila monster lived ! The Gila monster lived and the woman was so happy . GLENDA What kind of person has a pet Gila monster ? Really . DEREK I used to have one . GLENDA Oops . KATE Do n't pay any attention to her . I 'm sure Glenda 's just afraid of them . p. 17 GLENDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know how Meryl does it . DEREK So , how do you know Meryl ? GLENDA College . KATE ( Quickly ) The gym . DEREK What ? KATE ( Covering ) The College Gym . We all used to work out together at the College Gym on 73rd . It was the first place in town to have aerobics . At the end of the 70 's . GLENDA ( Catching on ) Those were the days . The Good old College Gym . ( The MAITRE D ' enters . ) MAITRE D ' Would you like another bottle ? GLENDA Yes , we would . And we 're still waiting for two other people . MAITRE D ' Oh . I see . ( He raises his eyebrows and leaves . ) DEREK Well . Meryl told me that friends of yours will be joining us ? KATE Right . ( Meaningfully , to GLENDA : ) Our " co-workers . " GLENDA Sort of . p. 18 DEREK What do you do ? KATE/GLENDA I 'm an attorney/I 'm an artist . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEREK How interesting . I never get to talk to anyone outside of pets and vets . This will be a real treat . We 'll be joined by one of each ? GLENDA To be specific , I 'm a sculptor . I like to touch things . But Kierran  --  my friend who 's joining us  --  - is a painter . He did that piece right there . ( She rises to admire it again . ) See ? ( DEREK half-stands , straining to examine it . ) DEREK ( Tentatively ) Great . What 's it called ? GLENDA " Sucking Pink Balloons . " ( KATE sputters , choking on her drink . ) KATE It 's not . GLENDA I can see it . Ca n't you ? ( MERYL returns from the bathroom . There 's a wet stain across her dress , making a funny pattern . ) MERYL See what ? ( They turn to acknowledge her . ) GLENDA Pink things . MERYL Where ? ( She examines her dress. ) p. 19 KATE Not on you . The painting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derek just asked about the men who are joining us . So I merely showed him Kierran 's work . Displayed for our dining pleasure . ( They stare dumbfounded at the painting . ) KATE ( Braking the silence ) My friend Michael is a public defender . MERYL ( Awkwardly ) Where should I sit ? DEREK ( Moves for her ) Right here . ( MERYL scoots in between KATE and DEREK . THE MAITRE D ' returns with another bottle of wine . ) MERYL So . What did I miss ? ( The MAITRE D ' pours MERYL another glass of wine , and fills glasses around the table . ) DEREK We were just getting acquainted . How could we have a good time without you ? GLENDA ( Antsy ) Plus , we 're still waiting . ( Looks at her watch . ) MERYL Traffic is probably bad . DEREK It was as clear as a bell for me . ( MERYL gives him a look . ) But then , I was n't coming from downtown . p. 20 GLENDA Kierran was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exits . ) KATE I hate it when people are late . It shows they have no regard for how valuable your time is . And whatever they 're doing is more important than their silly plans with you . GLENDA It does n't always mean that . I was late today . Sometimes you ca n't help it . Things just happen . Phone calls . Finding notes in your husband 's pockets ( KATE and MERYL exchange glances . ) DEREK What ? GLENDA Nothing ? KATE Uh , she said " Fixing coats in your husband 's closets . " GLENDA ( Sarcastically ) Right . DEREK You mean you 're an artist and you 're domestic ? You have a career and find time to take care of your husband 's clothes ? I have enough trouble just fixing dinner for myself , let alone for someone else  --  and help with clothes and such . ( KIERRAN enters , wearing incredibly artsy clothes ; he is buoyantly handsome , and walks with a passionate verve . He carries flowers for GLENDA . ) KIERRAN ( Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , KATE and MERYL turn . GLENDA stands up . Her elegant rise/movement is in direct contrast to MERYL 'S previous greeting of DEREK. ) p. 21 GLENDA Kierran . Darling . You made it . ( She hugs KIERRAN . ) KIERRAN For you . ( He presents the flowers to her . She takes them and smells them . KATE and MERYL exchange glances . ) GLENDA How beautiful . Thank you . ( GLENDA AND KIERRAN stare at each other for a moment . ) Let me introduce you to everyone . This is Meryl Sugarman . Kierran Carew . MERYL ( Waving ) Hi . KIERRAN Meryl ? Hi . GLENDA And this is Kate MacIntyre . KATE Hi . KIERRAN Hello . GLENDA And Derek I 'm sorry . I do n't know your last name yet . Derek DEREK ( Standing ) Crane . Derek Crane . KIERRAN Kierran Carew . DEREK Nice to meet you . GLENDA Why do n't you sit here by me ? ( GLENDA sits down and makes a place for KIERRAN . He starts to sit , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " Sucking Pink Balloons " . Why did n't you tell me ? GLENDA I wanted to surprise you . KIERRAN I 'm surprised . I 'm embarassed . I 'm dumbfounded . DEREK I like it . How much is it ? ( A beat . ) KIERRAN Well DEREK There 's nothing wrong with asking , is there ? KIERRAN No . It 's just . ( He shrugs and looks at GLENDA . ) GLENDA Most artists do n't like to put a price tag on their abilities . DEREK It 's not putting a price tag on ability . It 's putting a price on that specific piece , right ? MERYL What Derek means is ( GLENDA , KATE , DEREK and KIERRAN look at her with interest . ) MERYL ( Continued ) I 'm sorry . I mean , I think what Derek means is how can you sell it if you do n't know how much it is ? KATE Did you mean that ? DEREK Not exactly . MERYL ( Disappointed ) No ? Sorry . I thought I understood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I meant , asking the price of this painting is n't the same as asking the value of the painter . KIERRAN Right . We do n't do that in America until the artist dies . And then we say " Picasso 's early work  --  still traditional  --  $3 million . " " Dali 's last work  --  worthless  --  he signed blank sheets for his students . " Art becomes purely an investment . DEREK But is n't that the point of hanging it up here ? To sell it to someone ? KIERRAN It 's also for appreciation . I hope that patrons will look at it , think about it . React to it . DEREK Then do you ever give your work away ? GLENDA ( Pleasantly ) How about a glass of wine , Kierran ? KIERRAN Yes , thanks . ( GLENDA pours him another glass of wine . ) MERYL ( Sensing tension ) Derek , that 's a very personal question . KATE Maybe we should see a menu . DEREK I just wondered . I did n't mean anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's fair . No . I never give any work away . Because I ca n't afford to . My income is unstable and I need every penny . p. 24 DEREK You 're an honest man . GLENDA Yes . Honest and modest , darling . Kierran is well known in certain circles . He 's hardly a struggling artist . MERYL But if he gave it away , no one would think it was worth anything . It 's very ironic . KIERRAN Because no one knows that art is anymore . No one knows why we need it in our lives . DEREK So . How much is " Sucking Pink Balloons " ? KIERRAN For you , twenty five hundred . GLENDA ( Surprised ) That 's nothing . Your other work goes for much more than that ! DEREK ( Brightly ) I 'll think about it . ( To MERYL ) Would it go over my couch ? ( MERYL , KATE and GLENDA exchange knowing glances . ) MERYL I 'm not sure KIERRAN But you see , that 's the problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? That 's bullshit . Do you like it or not ? Two thousand dollars if you take it without thinking about what it matches . DEREK Two thousand ? ( He looks at MERYL. ) p. 25 KIERRAN It 's a special sale for you . Do n't think about the color of your walls . Think about the painting . DEREK I 've never bought any art before . GLENDA ( Aghast ) Never ? MERYL Well , neither have I , really . I can never afford your stuff , Glenda . I did buy a ceramic plate once . At a crafts fair . DEREK What would my mother think ? Of the sucking part GLENDA Live a little , Derek . The artist is offering you a deal . KIERRAN Fifteen hundred if you decide you like it and buy it , oh say within 10 seconds . ( He looks at his watch . ) Ten , nine , eight DEREK You told me this would be an expensive meal , Meryl , but not this expensive . GLENDA It 's worth three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glenda . You like to so much . KIERRAN Two . One . DEREK ( Deep breath ) Thanks , Kierran . Really . But I 'm going to pass on this one . I 'm just not an impulsive person . But I 'd love to see more of your work . p. 26 KIERRAN ( Makes buzzer noise ) Zzzzzz . GLENDA That was exciting . Do that again ! KATE It smells of male ritual to me . ( The MAITRE D ' enters . He passes out menus . ) KIERRAN Ah . Very perceptive , Kate . Perhaps that 's why it did n't work  --  too male , no sale . MAITRE D ' Doing business while dining is so bourgeois , so crude . I know we are still expecting another person here at the Beach party , because a Michael Tanner phoned with a message for Ms. Kate MacIntyre , seated with a large party . Ms. MacIntyre ? KATE I 'm Kate MacIntyre . MAITRE D ' As I thought . Mr. Tanner has been unavoidably detained . Please commence dining without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specials for me to tell you about at Delicacies . Because all our main courses are special . In fact , let me suggest that you recognize the true meaning of the word " entree " , and select your dish to give you entry and access to a new world , a new world offered to you in this unique dining experience of your own choosing . Here at Delicacies , we do n't say " Bon Appetit ! " . We say " Bon Choisi ! " I leave you now to discover the menu . ( MAITRE D ' exits. ) p. 27 KATE ( Puzzling ) That was n't correct . " Bon Choisi ? " MERYL ( Reading menu ) Choice ? There 's only one entree listed . " Hearts and Sole , for the saddened of spirit . Artichoke hearts and a filet . To fill you . " KATE It 's " Bon Choix . " I 'm sure . DEREK What does that mean ? KATE It 's French . Good choice . Happy choosing . GLENDA Wow . Listen to mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lusty and lurid . Poulet and our secret white sauce . " KATE Glenda , that 's really in bad taste . Please . GLENDA ( Indignant ) That 's what it says . KATE It 's not on my menu . GLENDA ( Pointing to her own menu ) Right here . KATE ( Puzzled ) Mine does n't say that . ( GLENDA shrugs . ) KIERRAN ( Reading ) " Celestial Crab With Wild , Wild Rice , for the promiscuous and truly fatalistic . Extra claws provided upon request . " ( He laughs. ) p. 28 DEREK I think these menus were done individually . The handwriting is beautiful . MERYL Customized menus ? How original . What does yours say , Kate ? GLENDA And yours , Derek . We have n't heard from either of you . ( DEREK looks at KATE but she motions for him to go ahead . ) KATE You first . ( She puzzles over hers . ) DEREK No , please . KATE Please . DEREK ( Clearing his throat ) Okay . " Non-Hum Drum Rum Casserole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festive sustenance . With fresh fruit . " KIERRAN That sounds like dessert . GLENDA It sounds good , though . Katie ? KATE I do n't know MERYL We 've all read ours . Come on . KATE " Individual Whole-Wheat Pizza . " MERYL That 's it ? KATE ( Holds menu ) See ? MERYL ( Reading ) " Individual Whole-Wheat Pizza . " Huh . p. 29 KIERRAN Does that have a special meaning to you ? Is it an Italian code or something ? GLENDA Does pizza have any significance to you ? KATE No , well ( She shrugs . ) I think I 'll get it , though . Just to see what comes on it . Frank hates pizza . KIERRAN Who 's Frank ? KATE My husband . ( GLENDA takes a sip of wine . MERYL looks down . ) DEREK What does he do ? KATE I do n't know anymore . I never see him . GLENDA He 's in real estate . KATE Right . Or something . ( The MAITRE D ' reappears . ) MAITRE D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think there 's much deliberation . Unless perhaps someone would like another menu or more options MAITRE D ' There are no options . The menus are fixe . KIERRAN No other options ? DEREK What if you wanted what someone else had ? Could n't that be arranged ? p. 30 MAITRE D ' You insult us . ( Shakes his head . ) This is Delicacies . The menus are fixe . Now , may I take your order ? DEREK Can we switch menus ? MAITRE D ' You mean ( says it like an expletive ) " trade " ? Trade entrees ? I hope the chef ca n't hear this . Of course , you could go elsewhere . However , you wo n't get the same , shall we say , service that we 're known for . GLENDA It comes highly recommended . Let 's order what we have on the menus . DEREK All right . I 'll have the MAITRE D ' Non-Hum Drum Rum Casserole . DEREK Right . MERYL The artichoke hearts and the sole . MAITRE D ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coq . MAITRE D ' The coq ? GLENDA Au vin ? MAITRE D ' Of course . And for you , madame ? KATE The generic pizza . MAITRE D ' Oh no . You mean the " Individual Pizza . " Do n't you ? p. 31 KATE With whole-wheat ? MAITRE D ' Exactly . There 's an enormous difference . You wo n't regret it . It 's extremely healthful . ( To KIERRAN ) The Celestial Crab and Wild , Wild Rice for you ? KIERRAN Please . ( They hand over their menus . ) MAITRE D ' Very good . May I suggest you tour the restaurant in the interim ?

This way , Derek . Perhaps we 'll find something for you to buy yet . ( KIERRAN and DEREK exit SR . GLENDA , MERYL and KATE smile and nod as they walk off . Then the smiles drop immediately when the 2 men are out of sight. ) p. 32 GLENDA Can you believe Kierran ? He 's so sexy . KATE Why are you so crotch-oriented tonight ? This is so unlike you . You 're so well , forward about sex . It 's all you 've talked about . GLENDA Go ahead and say it . I 'm horny . MERYL I hate that word . Except when talking about a toad .

Do n't be such a chicken . MERYL I just want to keep up with where we are , you know , as people . Okay ? There 's nothing wrong with that . But we do n't want anything to get out of control . KATE O.K. Fine . Inventory time . I like Derek , Meryl . I think he 's nice . MERYL Do you ? KATE Yes . He said some sweet things about you when you were gone . p. 33 GLENDA " Meryl Sugarman , Gila monster Savior . " MERYL That 's it ? Nothing romantic ? God . I do n't think he even likes me as much as I like him . It 's wonderful that he acknowledged my reptilian healing ability . But am I only a vet to him ? He does n't know I fantasize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing that gets me through the day . And he 's never even made a pass at me . GLENDA Well , then what do you do together ? Besides work ? MERYL We go to lunch . We talk about things . Life . You know . KATE I think he 's great . GLENDA I like Kierran 's pants , do n't you ? KATE Will you get your mind off his crotch ? GLENDA He 's so sexy . I 'm going to sleep with him . I can feel it . MERYL What about Jake ? GLENDA I want to talk about Kierran . Inventory time . MERYL ( Nervously ) He 's very uh explosive . KATE His pants are very tight GLENDA I want him I think . p. 34 KATE Since my date seems to be no-show , that about completes our inventory . Which leads me to the restaurant . What 's with this place , Glenda ? Why did n't you warn us that the menus were like fortune cookies ? GLENDA How was I supposed to know ? I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spanish Inquisition ? KATE ( Gulps a drink and then slams it down . ) Sorry . It 's just This is so damn embarassing . I ca n't even arrange to have a man I might like to have an affair with  --  show up on time . At least yours came . GLENDA Not yet . KATE Glenda ! MERYL Michael left a message . He 'll be here . KATE He 's so late . GLENDA He would n't have called if he was going to stand you up . KATE I spend my life waiting for men . In the office . At home . In restaurants . All I want is for him to show up so I can see how this feels . GLENDA The guy 's do n't know you or Michael . They wo n't care if he does n't come . Relax . KATE It 's the principle of the thing . Another thing , Glenda . Why do you think they 're serving crabs to Kierran ? p. 35 GLENDA I do n't know . MERYL Maybe you should think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think you 're getting " Individual Pizza " ? Because Michael 's not coming or something ? This wine is going to your head . Jeez , you 're not in court . Calm down . ( The MAITRE D ' appears , with MICHAEL , from SL . He looks worn out . He wears a suit , with the jacket slung over his shoulder . ) MAITRE D ' Here 's the Beach party , Mr. Tanner . Ms. MacIntyre is there . I 'll be right back with a menu for you . ( KATE stands up . ) KATE How dare you show up half an hour late , Michael Tanner  --  MICHAEL God , Kate . I 'm so sorry I 'm late . I lost the Reynolds thing . It went on and on in chambers . ( He throws himself on the floor , kneeling . ) Will you forgive me and marry me ? ( GLENDA , KATE and MERYL look at each other . ) GLENDA I like this guy . KATE You lost the case ? MICHAEL I lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat ) Michael , I want you to meet my friends , Glenda and Meryl . p. 36 MICHAEL ( Acknowledging them ) Hi . Answer me , Kate . Will you ? MERYL Michael , she 's already married . KATE ( Through her teeth ) I think he knows that . Please get up . You 're hurting your knees , are n't you ? MICHAEL I love you , Kate . And you probably would have won this case . ( The MAITRE D ' enters , carrying a menu . He stands and looks at MICHAEL for a moment . He considers MICHAEL 's position . He kneels and hands him a menu . MICHAEL takes the menu . ) MAITRE D ' I 'll be right back for your order . ( MAITRE D ' exits . ) MERYL You know , Michael . If I were you , before you get up , I 'd take a look to see what entree is listed in your menu . MICHAEL Why ? MERYL Take a look . What does it say ? MICHAEL ( Reading ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " KATE Oh , please . What 's a Cupid Muffin ? MICHAEL I do n't know . MERYL This is incredible . ( She takes the menu from MICHAEL . DEREK and KIERRAN enter . They stand , staring at MICHAEL kneeling. ) p. 37 DEREK Hi . I 'm Derek Crane . You must be Kate 's friend . MICHAEL ( Turning , still on floor ) I 'm Michael Tanner . Nice to meet you . KIERRAN I 'm Kierran Carew . MICHAEL A pleasure . DEREK What are you doing ? MICHAEL I 've just asked Kate to marry me . DEREK ( Brightly ) Ah . I see . KIERRAN And has she answered yet ? GLENDA No . KIERRAN Oh . ( KIERRAN and DEREK get into place , reverently . All watch KATE and MICHAEL . ) KATE Quit being absurd . Get up off the floor . This is no joking matter . You 're half an hour late , at least . MICHAEL Help me out , everyone . We 'd make a great couple . DEREK ( Bewildered ) But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a divorce . Right ? MICHAEL I 'm an attorney . I 'll handle it . KATE Please get up . I 'm going to cry if you do n't stop this . He 's joking , everybody . Really . p. 38 MICHAEL I 'm not . I need you . KIERRAN I 'd like to paint you , Mr. Tanner . Such passion . ( The MAITRE D ' enters . ) MAITRE D ' May I take your order , please ? MERYL He 'd like the game soup . GLENDA Actually , he needs the Cupid Muffin immediately . MAITRE D ' Very good . ( MERYL hands the MAITRE D ' the menu . To MICHAEL : ) Do you need help , sir ? MICHAEL No . Thank you . I 'm fine . ( The MAITRE D ' exits . ) KATE Please get off the floor , Michael . I 'm going to come pull you up . ( KATE crosses to MICHAEL . She grabs hold of MICHAEL 's arm . ) MICHAEL Marry me . You know I 'd make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public . ( She pulls him to his feet . ) MICHAEL Frank does n't make you happy anymore . KATE I never see him so I never think about it . Now will you quit talking about my marriage ? You 've just met these people . p. 39 MICHAEL I 've had a long , bad day and I want to woo you . KIERRAN Join us . Please . ( He motions for MICHAEL and KATE to sit down . He pours MICHAEL a glass of wine and hands it to him . ) MICHAEL All right . I 'll sit . For now . If Kate forgives me for being late . KATE I guess I do . Quit pleading your case . KIERRAN ( To MICHAEL ) I think I 'd like to be represented by you . Do you have a card ? ( MICHAEL sits down at the table . He pulls out a card and hands it to KIERRAN . KATE sits beside MICHAEL . ) MICHAEL Here . But I 'm a public defender , so it wo n't really do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's who ? KATE I 'm Kate MacIntyre . MICHAEL Thanks . I know that much . KATE Meryl and Derek work together . KIERRAN Glenda and I met at a gallery that was showing our stuff . KATE They 're artists . DEREK And we 're vets. p. 40 MICHAEL Vets ? MERYL As in veterinarians . DEREK Meryl saved a Gila monster today . KIERRAN Great . MICHAEL Way to go , Meryl . ( A beat . ) MERYL Is n't it interesting that we 're each sitting here with a member of the opposite sex that works in our profession ? KATE ( Grimacing ) It 's fascinating . GLENDA Amazing . MERYL You see , I have a theory about that . KATE Do you ? MERYL Do n't you want to hear it ? KATE ( Forced ) Oh , by all means . Go on . GLENDA Yes . Tell us . MERYL Well , because of the arrival of women in the work force in the 20th century , in the 21st century , women and men will mate at the workplace more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , or wherever . And women , because of their careers , will wait a lot longer to get married . When they do marry , they 'll marry someone that does the same job that they do . Because women want to be treated as equals . And they 're more likely to be treated like that , as an equal , on the job . They 'll want husbands who respect their professional and intellectual capacities . p. 41 KIERRAN Interesting . But what about having children ? MERYL Women will be encouraged to wait until their 30 's . Like us . And then they 'll only risk having one child . Because of the biological timeclock . MICHAEL What a dim view of the future . Marriage to someone who does your job . Only one child . MERYL How many children do you want ? MICHAEL Lots . That 's why I got a divorce . My ex-wife did n't want any . She did n't have time . KATE You ca n't have it both ways . You ca n't want a breadwinner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys have this American Express Gold Card male fantasy  --  someone who can keep up your home , greet you in lingerie and bring in six figures . Forget it . It 's a full time job to take care of a house . It 's a full time job to keep in good enough shape to wear lingerie . And it 's a full time job to earn six figures . Three full times jobs . While all you want to do is one . ( A beat ) DEREK I 've never been married and my theory is this . Children and animals share several things in common . You can tell what kind of parent someone would be by the kind of pet owner they are . GLENDA Really . For instance , the owner of the Gila Monster . What kind of parent is she ? p. 42 DEREK Pretty good . She paid attention to her pet . She was concerned enough to bring it in . MERYL How about someone like me ? DEREK You 'd be the best . ( A beat ) KIERRAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glenda , forget your marriage and play around with me . You already said you 'd pose for me . Right ? GLENDA Yes . But that was for art . KIERRAN Forget about art . What about for you and me ? GLENDA Kierran , I live for art . In fact , it 's been one of my dreams to meet an artist who was as good as me , and who 'd see enough in me , the real me , to want to capture the essence of my spirit . In art . KIERRAN Okay . But what about love ? GLENDA ( Bitterly ) Love has ruined my art . KATE Glenda KIERRAN What do you mean ? GLENDA Nothing . ( The MAITRE D ' enters and pours more wine . ) MERYL What are you talking about ? p. 43 GLENDA Love ruins art . Because love can ruin the artist . The artist can lose her heart . MAITRE D ' ( To GLENDA ) More wine ? GLENDA Please . ( Turning her attention to him . ) What about you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame opinion . MAITRE D ' This is Delicacies , Madame . Our food is a pure discussion of love . MICHAEL Your food talks ? MAITRE D ' You 'll see . Your entrees will be ready shortly . I hope you 'll be ready too . ( He exits . ) KATE Curiouser and curiouser . KIERRAN Listen , I 've got a proposition for you . We can kill two birds with one stone . I can paint you , to immortalize you , and we can have an affair . DEREK But she 's married . KIERRAN So ? DEREK Does n't that slow you down just a bit ? KIERRAN Should it ? Is n't it up to her ? Really ? p. 44 DEREK Do n't you have any respect for the institution ? KIERRAN I have respect for Glenda . That 's why I want her . Now do n't butt in here and make her feel guilty . ( Man-to-man : ) I 'm flirting over here , Derek . DEREK Okay . I guess . KIERRAN Do n't you ever flirt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MERYL No . DEREK ( To KIERRAN ) No . KIERRAN Why not ? Does n't it make you feel good when you can catch her eye from across the room ? DEREK Sometimes . KIERRAN And does n't it make you happy when you see her smile ? DEREK Sure . KIERRAN So when you flirt with a woman , all you 're doing is combining those two actions with speech . Eye contact , upturned mouth to open mouth . That 's what flirting is and it feels good . Flirting leads other good , physical things as well . DEREK Obviously . But I do n't want to impose my wishes on a woman . I do n't want to make Meryl or any woman feel uncomfortable , as if they 're prey and I 'm a predator . p. 45 KATE You can tell he 's a vet . MICHAEL Did I just order game soup ? What a weird menu . There was no choice . MERYL From that delayed reaction , you can tell he 's an attorney . KIERRAN If there 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone 's got to start it . DEREK Love just starts itself . You ca n't force it . And you 've got to work to maintain it . GLENDA ( Angry ) Derek 's right . You 've got to work to maintain it . I wish other goddamned men realized that . KIERRAN Ooh . GLENDA Well , if you 'd just caught your husband having an affair with some office idiot , you 'd feel the same way . ( A beat . ) DEREK You actually caught him ? MERYL Derek  --  GLENDA No . I did n't walk in and see them screwing on my bed , and smell his come dripping down her legs , and then throw a net around them . ( Softly : ) I saw them in a car . KIERRAN Glenda GLENDA His car , to be exact . p. 46 KATE Well , at least you saw him . I never see Frank . MERYL Are you sure ? Really ? GLENDA ( Rising ) It was him , all right . He was sucking her pink balloons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot . I 'd know that head of balding hair anywhere . And does he want to make love with me ? When he has the chance ? No . MICHAEL I can refer you to someone good . You 've got grounds . KATE Michael  --  KIERRAN Maybe we should go for a walk , honey . There 's some other art work we can see . Some good stuff . Or we can get some fresh air . GLENDA Is this too embarassing ? For my oldest friends in the world and their new " friends " ? Fine . I 'll leave . MERYL I 'll come with you . KATE Me , too . ( KATE and MERYL rise . They take GLENDA arm in arm . ) MERYL I 'm sorry . KATE You should have told us . ( The MAITRE D ' pops open the kitchen door . He wheels in a tray with the food on it . He crosses in front of the 3 women , and starts to serve the food with great flourish. ) p. 47 MAITRE D ' Voila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First , the Individual Whole-Wheat Pizza . KATE That 's mine . MAITRE D ' I know . ( He puts it down on the table . ) MICHAEL That looks great . MAITRE D ' And it 's all hers . ( To MERYL : ) Hearts and Sole . MERYL Yum . MAITRE D ' It 's filling . Warming . You try it immediately , Madame . While it 's hot . ( He removes a lid . ) Here we have coq au vin . Madame . GLENDA I 'm not hungry . MAITRE D ' De Jake . ( A beat . ) KATE Yuck . ( A beat . GLENDA smiles and sits down . The MAITRE D ' serves her . MERYL and KATE sit down . ) MAITRE D ' That 's the chef 's name for it , Ms. MacIntyre . Next , Celestial Crab and Wild , Wild Rice . ( Serves it . ) KIERRAN Thanks . MAITRE D ' Non-Hum Drum Rum Casserole ? DEREK Right here . ( The MAITRE D ' serves it. ) p. 48 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muffin . MICHAEL Thanks . GLENDA What a beautiful banquet . I think I will eat . I wonder what they have for dessert . MAITRE D ' Do n't think about dessert yet . Think about your feast . A feast is anything that gives pleasure because of its abundance or richness it will delight , a very special treat Your entres are served . Enjoy . ( MERYL and KATE give each other a worried look . GLENDA and KIERRAN start eating . TEDDY and MICHAEL so the same ; various sounds of orgiastic pleasure are heard as opera music swells . A tableau , then : ) @x ( A few weeks later , at the same restaurant , early evening . The MAITRE D ' enters and sets up the table . JAKE and TEDDY enter through the front door . They wear suits and are attractive but have a stale Yuppie air about them . The MAITRE D ' continues to work on the place settings . JAKE and TEDDY wait at the podium . Classical harp music is again heard . ) JAKE So the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Shrugging ) Yeah . But that 's the way the ball bounces sometimes . JAKE Big loss ? TEDDY Took me to the cleaners . JAKE Too bad . Hey . Let me know if you 'd like to try again . I hear leads all the time that might interest you . TEDDY Thanks , Jake . I 'll let you know . ( Indicates MAITRE D ' ) Wonder what we have to do to get seated around here . JAKE He saw us come in . He 's more interested in seeing himself in the silverware . TEDDY I hate places like this . JAKE Me too . TEDDY Meryl went on and on about it . You know how they get about these things . p. 50 JAKE Glenda said it was a magical place . Get that ? " Magical " . TEDDY Maybe they do tricks . JAKE The trick is to get seated . TEDDY ( Looking around ) They 're not busy . We 're the first ones here . JAKE You know the girls will be late . They always are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosses to them . ) MAITRE D ' Welcome to Delicacies . May I help you ? TEDDY Yes . We have reservations . MAITRE D ' ( Looking at list ) The name ? TEDDY I do n't know . What name would they use ? JAKE Try ' em all . TEDDY Sugarman ? MAITRE D ' Yes . Very good . Right this way , please . ( The MAITRE D ' leads TEDDY and JAKE to the table . KIERRAN 'S painting is still visible . JAKE glances at it before sitting down . ) JAKE Do you have another table ? MAITRE D ' Ms. Sugarman specifically requested this table . Is there a problem ? p. 51 JAKE ( A beat ) No . MAITRE D ' Would you like to see the wine list ? TEDDY Well , got anything on tap ? MAITRE D ' On " tap " ? ( Frowns ) No . We do have imported beer . Would you like to see the list ? TEDDY ( Joking ) Nothing domestic ? I 'm in a patriotic mood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bring the list . MAITRE D ' Right away . ( He crosses to the podium and gets the wine/beer list . He hands it to TEDDY ) Sir . ( He exits . ) TEDDY ( Leafs through the pages ) All this just to get a beer . JAKE They 'll charge you four times what it 's worth . TEDDY And women find these places romantic . JAKE Go figure , Ted . TEDDY ( Puts down the list ) What do you think this whole thing 's about , anyway ? JAKE This dinner ? p. 52 TEDDY Yeah . JAKE Glenda told me they just wanted us to get together . And none of them had time to cook . Like for a dinner party . TEDDY Really ? That 's all ? JAKE What did Meryl tell you ? TEDDY Nothing . She just acted funny about it . JAKE Funny how ? TEDDY Like she was , I do n't know . I wonder why she requested this table . JAKE Been having problems ? TEDDY Oh , no . How are you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great . Great . ( A beat ) JAKE See that painting ? ( TEDDY and JAKE stare at " Sucking pink Balloons . " ) TEDDY Yeah ? JAKE They call that art . TEDDY Looks like pornography to me . I like it . JAKE Glenda knows the guy who did it . TEDDY Yeah ? p. 53 JAKE I recognize his style . Kierran Carew , the twerp . She has some slides , you know , of his work . She looks at them every day . She leaves them lying around the house . TEDDY Ever met him ? JAKE Yeah . At a party . The weirdo . TEDDY Anyone 's who 's an artist . Well , I mean , not Glenda , of course , I mean Any man who does that for a living , chooses that kind of lifestyle , you 'd expect them to be weird . JAKE Glenda likes him . TEDDY How do you know ? JAKE I can just tell . She likes those sensitive types . You 've seen ' em . They ca n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women love ' em . TEDDY Curly hair ? JAKE Right . TEDDY I know the type . JAKE She could have married someone like that . Back in school . I do n't know why she did n't , if she likes assholes so much . TEDDY Come on . She probably likes to talk to him about what kind of clay to use , what gallery is showing what , artsy things like that . JAKE That 's another thing . The clay . p. 54 TEDDY What about it ? JAKE It 's really starting to turn me off . TEDDY What do you mean ? JAKE Every time I come home , she 's covered in clay . It used to excite me . But now , I do n't know . It reminds me of dirt . TEDDY I know what you mean . JAKE When we were first married , Glenda was a sculptor and all . But she 'd clean up when I came home from work . You know ? Now , I 'm lucky if there 's food in the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JAKE Right . TEDDY It never used to bother me . I mean , there 's soap . Right ? But lately , I keep thinking about all the dogs and cats , and who knows what else she has her hands on JAKE Lots of fur . TEDDY About a month ago she made the biggest deal out of saving a lizard . And all I could think about was her hands  --  on it . ( The MAITRE D ' enters . ) MAITRE D ' Have you decided on a beer ? ( TEDDY opens the wine/beer list and points. ) p. 55 TEDDY I 'd like one of those . JAKE Make that two . MAITRE D ' Very good . ( TEDDY hands the MAITRE D ' the list and the MAITRE D ' exits . FRANK enters from SR . JAKE waves to him . ) JAKE ( Waving ) Frank . Over here . FRANK ( Crosses to the table . ) Long time no see . TEDDY I 'll say . Good to see you . JAKE Pull up a chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and run , but I wanted to stop by and say hi . Have n't seen you two in I do n't know how long has it been ? JAKE Christmas ? TEDDY Longer than that . FRANK It 's been a hell of a long time . How 's everything going ? TEDDY Great . How 're you ? FRANK Great . TEDDY We 'll see if we can get you a beer . If you do n't mind waiting for the ( In a formal voice : ) " Maitre D ' . " FRANK ( Looking around ) One of those places . p. 56 JAKE Yeah . FRANK Kate left me a message to meet everyone here . I 'd never heard of it . JAKE Leave it to them . " Delicacies " . FRANK Kate said no one had room for dessert last time so they wanted to come again . And save room . JAKE Right . And then start a new diet tomorrow . TEDDY So how 's your golf game , Frank ? Tearing up the greens ? FRANK Have n't played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) TEDDY Have n't had the time . FRANK Why do n't we get together for a game , take an afternoon off . JAKE Great . I know a fourth . FRANK Okay . Shall I have my woman call your woman ? TEDDY Okay . Next week ? FRANK Sounds do-able . ( The MAITRE D ' enters with 2 beers on a tray . He hands them to TEDDY and JAKE . He acknowledges FRANK . ) MAITRE D ' Would you like to see the wine list ? p. 57 TEDDY Could we have another one of these ? MAITRE D ' Certainly . I 'll be right back . ( The MAITRE D ' exits and the three men exchange glances . ) TEDDY ( To FRANK ) So how 's it going at the office ? FRANK In a word  --  busy . JAKE Sounds good . FRANK Ca n't complain . Except I 've been working late . JAKE I know how that is . FRANK It used to bother Kate , but now , she works so much herself I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care . Now , our lives are total mysteries to each other . TEDDY ( Interjecting ) You do n't know what she does all day she does n't know what you do  --  JAKE Right . So when we are together , we have nothing in common . Except the house . I 've got more to say to my secre  --  assistant . FRANK Because you 're around her ? JAKE Sure . At least I know what 's on her mind . Glenda  --  who knows ? And the worst thing is , I miss her . p. 58 TEDDY Who ? JAKE Glenda . TEDDY Yeah . Yeah . It 's not like the old days , the good old days . FRANK You mean like in college ? TEDDY We used to know everything then . Did n't we ? JAKE Sure . We knew their clothes , we knew their books , we knew their friends , we knew their dreams . FRANK We knew their jokes . TEDDY Their jokes What was that thing they used to do in restaurants ? Remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a big kick out of it . JAKE Yeah , yeah . Glenda would do this crazy thing . With the reservations . She would put in the reservations under a fake name . Something really dumb . TEDDY Meryl used to love that . Was n't it garden ? She would always say we were the Garden Party ? Something like that . FRANK ( Smiles ) Beach party . JAKE Right . The Beach party . I knew it was something like that . FRANK It 's funny , if you think about it p. 59 JAKE Glenda would never do something like that now . It 's like we grew up and grew boring together FRANK Maybe we just do n't know them anymore . TEDDY Maybe we do n't know them . We do n't know what they think about or what they want What do women want these days ? JAKE Who knows ? FRANK I know what women want . ( JAKE and TEDDY look at FRANK . ) TEDDY You do ? FRANK Sure . ( A pause . ) TEDDY Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na write a fucking book about it and make us buy it . FRANK A fucking book ? Maybe . TEDDY Come on . FRANK It 's easy . What do women want ? They want the same things that men want . ( A pause . ) TEDDY What do we want ? JAKE Ted . Please . TEDDY Well , what do we want ? I do n't know . p. 60 JAKE Think about it . TEDDY I do n't know . I used to know . Exactly . I had it all planned out . Like a chart . At 25 , I 'll be married and make X amount of dollars . At 30 , I 'll own this kind of home . At 35 , I 'll start having a family . At 40 , buy that second home in the country . But things are so screwed up . Nothing 's turned out the way I planned . JAKE I know what I want . A million bucks and happiness Not in that order . FRANK Women want to be loved . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things : friendship , kindness , sensitivity , excitement , caring  --  JAKE He is writing a book . FRANK They want to be treated like we want to be treated . It 's easy . TEDDY Things must be great between you and Kate . FRANK Why ? TEDDY You know so much about what women want . FRANK Do you think I can talk to Kate about it ? Are you crazy ? TEDDY You do n't talk to Kate ? FRANK How can I ? I never see her . JAKE Well , if you have this theory , " treat them the way you 'd like to be treated " , should n't you try it out ? p. 61 FRANK I 've been wanting to try it out . But I 'm scared Why do you think I 'm in therapy ? I want to change things . But when I do see her , I 'm so glad , just to see her that I never know what to say . How do you talk to women , anyway ? JAKE I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean those kind of women . JAKE What do you mean , " those kind of women " ? TEDDY I thought you meant . women of the night . JAKE Prostitutes ? You thought I was talking about whores ? I was talking about women I work with . I have no trouble talking to women I work with . TEDDY Sorry . JAKE Jeez , Ted . Talk about stepping on your dick . What if you 'd said something like that around the girls ? We 'd be dead . FRANK The women . JAKE Sorry . The women . TEDDY Do n't worry . JAKE You could have really gotten me into trouble . TEDDY I 'll be careful . I do n't talk that much around them anyhow . ( KATE and MERYL enter . They are dressed in stylish suits . FRANK sees them. ) p. 62 FRANK ( Waving ) Put a muzzle on it . Here they are . JAKE Glenda 's not with them . FRANK Hello ! ( KATE and MERYL cross to the table . ) KATE Hello . FRANK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ? TEDDY No , honey . Not really . This is some place you picked . ( MERYL and KATE sit down . ) MERYL Do n't you love it ? TEDDY Yeah . MERYL You 'll see . KATE Has he told you what Delicacies means yet ? TEDDY Are you kidding ? This guy can barely serve a beer , let alone talk . JAKE You heard from Glenda ? ( KATE and MERYL shake their heads " no " . ) JAKE She 's always so late anymore . KATE She just gets caught up in her work . Loses track of time . You know how it is , Jake . JAKE I do ? p. 63 KATE Do n't you ? Working late ? JAKE I try not to . KATE Frank does it all the time . FRANK Hi . ( All turn to look at FRANK . ) KATE Hi . FRANK How are you ? KATE I 'm fine . FRANK What ' ve you been  --  thinking about lately ? KATE Adultery and murder ( explaining ) My cases . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this accountant who killed his wife because she was having an affair . I think we 're gon na nail him . I think we 're going to hold him accountable . ( All shift in response to KATE 's story . MERYL sips some wine . ) FRANK Good Honey , I hate to say this , but I 'm going to have to eat and run . KATE ( Shrugging ) That 's okay . MERYL Frank , are you sure ? We never get to see you . KATE Could n't you cancel whatever it is ? FRANK It 's an important client . It was the only time he could meet . p. 64 KATE At dinner ? ( The MAITRE D ' enters with another beer . He serves it to FRANK . He looks at KATE and MERYL . ) FRANK Thanks . You want to come with me ? KATE I thought we 'd eat here . With everybody . That 's what having dinner means . MAITRE D ' Good evening . Welcome to Delicacies . May I show you the wine list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's bourgeois and crude to do business at dinner . Right ? ( She looks at the MAITRE D ' ) ( The MAITRE D ' nods and goes to the podium to get the wine list . He hands it to KATE . ) KATE Thanks . ( KATE looks at the wine list . ) So cancel . FRANK I ca n't . ( The MAITRE D ' exits SR . ) TEDDY ( Refering to MAITRE D ' ) Is n't he Mr. Personality ? ( KATE and MERYL exchange glances . ) MERYL He was before . TEDDY When were you here before ? MERYL You know . The three of us ate here . p. 65 TEDDY Oh , right . JAKE That 's why Glenda thought it was a magical place . From your dinner . MERYL Yes . Uh  --  huh . TEDDY I 'm trying to remember the charge slip . You charged it , right ? MERYL No . TEDDY Are you sure ? MERYL We I paid cash . TEDDY Just trying to keep track . Do we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KATE They like to wait until everyone is seated before they give you menus . JAKE Why ? KATE It 's a surprise . MERYL You 'll see . I ca n't wait to see what 's going to happen here tonight . TEDDY You really like this place , do n't you ? MERYL Yes . TEDDY Then I 'll probably like it , too . FRANK ( Looking at his watch ) I do n't know . Maybe I should just get an appetizer now . MERYL I do n't think they have any appetizers. p. 66 FRANK They do n't ? TEDDY I thought appetizers would be their specialty since it 's named Delicacies . MERYL Please do n't complain , Teddy . TEDDY Do n't nag . ( A beat . The MAITRE D ' returns . ) MAITRE D ' Have you decided on a wine ? KATE Meryl , how about a bottle of Pouilly Fuisse ? MERYL Fine . MAITRE D ' Very good . MERYL And someone in our party has to leave early . MAITRE D ' I 'll bring your appetizers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have special appetizer ? Already prepared ? MAITRE D ' Indeed . ( He starts to cross to the podium . ) MERYL Oh , I ca n't wait . KATE Wait . Are n't you going to tell them about Delicacies ? MAITRE D ' You mean the history of the restaurant , Madame ? KATE All the meanings of the word . You remember . Your speech . p. 67 MAITRE D ' Tonight you will experience the finest appetizers that Delicacies has to offer . Appetizer comes from the word appetite . The Latin roots are " ad petere " , meaning " to desire ' , which is the main purpose of any appetizer to satisfy desire , either through a small portion of a delicate hors d'oeuvre at the beginning of a meal , or with an aperitif or for a bit of anything that excites a desire for more of whatever you want . But it 's important to match your appetizer with the correct entree ; certain delicacies simply do not belong together . And one must retain a sense of balance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guides for our stomachs or hearts . I 'll leave you to consider your desires . I 'll be right back with your wine . ( He exits . ) JAKE Is this a classroom or what ? MERYL I thought it was interesting . TEDDY Very . No , really . It was . But he did n't mention any food for us to think about . KATE Interesting etymology . FRANK There you go again , honey , being polysyllabic . You lawyers . KATE Well , I did n't know it meant " to desire " in Latin . JAKE Neither did I. Now we know . And Teddy 's got a point . He did n't mention any food , specifically . p. 68 MERYL Everything happens here for a reason . The chef is very creative . TEDDY Call me traditional but a menu would be a nice touch , in my opinion . ( GLENDA enters and crosses to the table . She wears a white blouse and dark pants . ) GLENDA Sorry I 'm late . ( She sits down . ) JAKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? GLENDA Fine . JAKE You look great . Have n't seen you this clean in a long time . GLENDA ( Coldly ) Thanks . JAKE Usually she 's covered with clay , the working artist . GLENDA That 's me . Just a living dustball . JAKE Come on . I did n't mean it like that . Sorry . GLENDA Well , how 's everyone else ? KATE I think we 're all concerned because Frank 's got to run . He had just enough time to squeeze in an appetizer . GLENDA I see . That 's too bad . p. 69 MERYL You just missed what appetizer means . ( Indicates MAITRE D ' ) We were informed that it has to do with desire . GLENDA We all know a lot about that . JAKE What 's that supposed to mean ? GLENDA Look around the table . A pretty lusty bunch . TEDDY I bet this place serves rabbit food . Oh , sorry Meryl . I know you like rabbits and their food . But what 's so special about this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MERYL When we were here before , the menus were customized . TEDDY Customized . GLENDA Different . For each of us . JAKE Are you sure you did n't have too much to drink ? You were hung over the next day . GLENDA Positive . Everyone 's was that way . JAKE Everyone 's ? KATE ( Quickly ) All three of us . MERYL Yes . And we sat at this very same table . JAKE Was this damn picture hanging here ? p. 70 MERYL/GLENDA Yes/No . TEDDY Which was it ? KATE Maybe the place has changed management or something . We 'll ask . JAKE Did you tell them you know this guy ? GLENDA ( Looking around ) What guy ? JAKE Cryin ' Carew . Or whatever his name is . GLENDA Kierran . JAKE Excuse me . Kierran . GLENDA I might have mentioned it . JAKE I thought so . GLENDA So what ? JAKE Nothing . I 'm starting to lose my appetite . FRANK Kate and I are n't really into art yet . But we want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRANK Do n't we ? We said we did . It 's on our projected goals for the next five years . GLENDA What do you think of the painting behind us , Frank ? Think it would be a good investment ? ( FRANK gets up to look at it. ) p. 71 FRANK I think it 's a bold statement . MERYL How diplomatic . KATE How Donald Trump . GLENDA Nice brushstrokes , do n't you think ? FRANK A playful use of color . Will it appreciate ? A little . Is it art ? I do n't know . MERYL I really like it . TEDDY Me , too . Sort of reminds me of someone . ( MERYL looks at him ) JAKE Meryl , you 're not going to defend this piece of crap . MERYL I 'd put it in my home . TEDDY Like over the bed ? ( MERYL frowns at TEDDY ) MERYL I think it would make me laugh when I come home . It 's the kind of piece you could get used to , like a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? KATE The pink balloons . You could name the pink balloons . JAKE ( Pointing at them ) Like " Tweedledum and Tweedledee " , for instance ? p. 72 TEDDY You could give them name tags . Like pets , honey . Get it ? ( MERYL nods . ) KATE You could talk to them . FRANK ( Looks at KATE ) You 'd sit around talking to those ? KATE It 's better than talking to yourself . MERYL I do n't know about that . But I really like the work . FRANK Tell me , did he have a National Endowment for the Arts grant ? JAKE ( Edgy ) Who gives a flying fuck ? GLENDA Jake . ( The MAITRE D ' enters . He carries platters of mussels . ) MAITRE D ' Voila . Your appetizers are served . Mussels for everyone ! ( He puts the platters of mussels on the table . ) GLENDA Great . Some of us could use some mussels . JAKE What does that mean ? GLENDA ( Pleasantly ) Nothing . Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for eight years . You know what I like . p. 73 GLENDA Do I ? ( The MAITRE D ' looks at them . ) MAITRE D ' I 'll be right back with your wine . TEDDY Wait  --  MAITRE D ' And more beer , of course . ( The MAITRE D ' exits . ) FRANK I guess we know why this place is so empty , with service like this . MERYL Mussels . Mussels . Why did they serve us mussels ? ( She looks at GLENDA and KATE . GLENDA smiles , KATE shrugs . ) TEDDY I do n't really like mussels . How do you eat them ? MERYL I 've never really had them . KATE Try them once . ( KATE demonstrates . TEDDY and MERYL watch and try to imitate her at the same time . JAKE picks at his . GLENDA does the same . FRANK eats heartily . Throughout the next part , everyone eats . ) TEDDY Hey , everyone . Meryl was written up in a vet newsletter . JAKE Great . FRANK Terrific . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell us ? p. 74 MERYL I was going to . TEDDY I 'll make her send you all a copy . FRANK What was it about ? TEDDY Saving a lizard remember I was telling you , Jake ? GLENDA The Gila Monster ? ( KATE chokes on the mussels . ) MERYL Yes . TEDDY You heard about it ? GLENDA Meryl told us . TEDDY Was I the last to know ? MERYL No . No . GLENDA Congratulations . How 'd they find out about it ? I know Meryl 's too modest to have told anyone TEDDY Oh , from some guy that works with her , Derek  --  Crane or Crow or something ( He looks at MERYL ) KATE ( Matter-of-factly ) It 's Crane . ( She immediately regrets saying this . ) TEDDY/FRANK You know him ? KATE Uh , no . No . Maybe I 've seen his name or something On a case p. 75 GLENDA ( To the rescue ) So how is work , Kate ? KATE I 've been putting in a lot of hours lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billing the clients but it 's really been taking its toll on me . I do n't have time to work out . Or anything . FRANK I do n't think you 've even met our new housekeeper . KATE We 've got a new housekeeper ? FRANK Do n't you remember ? I told you . Maria left . KATE Why ? FRANK She moved . KATE Oh . What 's the new housekeeper 's name ? FRANK Jill . KATE I have n't seen her . ( The MAITRE D ' enters with the wine and beer . He pours the wine . The women acknowledge him as he pours . ) FRANK You 're never home before eight or nine anymore . KATE Are you ? FRANK Sometimes . I had time to hire a new housekeeper , at least . MAITRE D ' And how are your appetizers ? Are the mussels strengthening your desire ? p. 76 TEDDY They 're squishy . GLENDA ( Under her breath ) Like some other things we know . MERYL ( Covering ) Fine , thank you . KATE Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to see some menus ASAP . Okay ? We 're really hungry . We 'd like to order in this century . MAITRE D ' As you wish . ( The MAITRE D ' nods and exits . ) KATE What 's she like ? FRANK Who ? KATE This new housekeeper . Jill . FRANK I do n't know Young . You know . KATE Young . FRANK You have n't noticed anything being dirty , have you ? KATE No . I do n't seem to notice much around the old homestead anymore . She must be doing a fine job . TEDDY At least you have a housekeeper . MERYL Do you want one ? TEDDY Neither one of us have the time to keep up the house . Half the time we ca n't even manage to do laundry . p. 77 JAKE That 's what 's nice about having Glenda work at home . She always has time to take care of the chores . GLENDA Yes . My days at home are spent in leisure . Watering plants . Scrubbing floors . Taking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jake . JAKE I 'm really proud of you  --  you are able to juggle a lot . That 's all I meant . GLENDA Thanks . ( The MAITRE D ' returns with menus , passing them out and unfolding them for each person . MERYL gives TEDDY a look . ) MERYL Are n't you going to explain the menus ? MAITRE D ' I think you 'll find they 're self-explanatory . KATE ( Almost pleading ) But are n't there any specials ? MAITRE D ' Not tonight . ( Everyone opens menus . ) FRANK They 're plenty of appetizers listed here . MERYL Sorry . It 's changed since the last time we were here . ( To MAITRE D ' ) This wo n't change the evening , will it ? MAITRE D ' It depends on what you order . p. 78 FRANK ( To KATE ) Do you know what you want ? KATE Yes . I 'd like the Individual Whole-Wheat Pizza . ( The MAITRE D ' pauses . ) FRANK I do n't see that on here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAITRE D ' I 've have to check with the chef . FRANK Honey , there are plenty of other things here . Ca n't you find something else ? KATE I loved that . I want to try it again . Tonight . FRANK We do n't want to hold everybody else 's order up . KATE You 're the only one in a hurry . FRANK ( To MAITRE D ' ) Fine . I 'm just having the appetizer . MAITRE D ' Very good . MERYL I 'd like to have the hearts and sole again . TEDDY ( Checking the menu ) Where do you see those ? MERYL They 're not there . But as long as you 're checking with the chef MAITRE D ' I 'll ask . p. 79 TEDDY There 's plenty to choose from . MERYL But that 's what I want . TEDDY Okay . MAITRE D ' And for you , sir ? TEDDY I 'd like a hamburger , please . With some fries . MAITRE D ' Very good . ( To GLENDA : ) Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing you had before . GLENDA No . I 'll make it easy . I 'll just have whatever you 're having . JAKE Okay . Suit yourself . I 'd like Filet Mignon . GLENDA Ditto . MAITRE D ' Two filets mignon . How would you like those ? JAKE Well-done . GLENDA Rare . JAKE Do we get a salad or anything with that ? MAITRE D ' ( Indicating menu ) Yes , sir . You can see you get salad and a vegetable . JAKE I 'd like ranch dressing . MAITRE D ' We serve only the house dressing . p. 80 JAKE Whatever . MAITRE D ' Thank you . ( MAITRE D ' takes menus and exits . A beat . MERYL turns to admire the picture . ) MERYL ( To TEDDY ) Maybe it 's time we take a plunge , Teddy . Into the art world . You want to get that picture ? We could buy it tonight . TEDDY It 's pretty sexy . Might be the kind of thing we need . MERYL So you really like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not a dirty picture . It 's beautiful . JAKE They make good investments , Ted . But I would n't go for this artist . KATE Why not ? JAKE Who 's ever heard of him ? KATE Is n't that part of the fun ? Discovering artists that you like , and if they become part of the artistic elite or if they do n't , it does n't matter , because you like what their work says . To you . JAKE Yeah , you 're right . It should work that way . I wish more people felt that way about Glenda 's work . Felt it said something . GLENDA So do I. p. 81 JAKE ( Standing ) Honey , your stuff says a hell of a lot more than this crap . This is trash . ( Looks at the title . ) " Sucking Pink Balloons " . My ass . It 's a travesty . GLENDA I love it . JAKE You love the artist . There 's a difference . GLENDA How do you know what I think of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that party last week . You thought I did n't notice . But I did . GLENDA I did not fall all over anyone . FRANK ( Pleasantly ) Kate ? More mussels ? KATE No thanks . ( FRANK passes the mussels around . KATE lets them pass her by . MERYL takes some . TEDDY takes some , too . ) JAKE You held onto his arm . GLENDA You hold onto a lot more than that . JAKE What 's that supposed to mean ? GLENDA You know all about sucking pink balloons , Jake . It 's okay for you to do it , but when I do it , it bothers you . What kind of a double standard is that ? What kind of marriage is that ? p. 82 TEDDY Glenda . Jake . Please . ( MERYL glares at TEDDY . FRANK looks at his watch . ) FRANK Well , I got ta run . Have some more mussels , Jake . Finish my beer . You 'll feel better . ( He rises to go . He puts some cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hope to see you all again real soon . KATE Yes . Hope to see you soon . MERYL Thanks for coming . FRANK It was great . Wish me luck at my meeting , honey . I need it . KATE Good luck at your meeting . FRANK Listen . Call me . We need to schedule some time together . So we can talk out a couple of things  --  we 've got some financial decisions to make . The IRA thing . KATE Sure . Maybe next week . ( FRANK leans over to kiss KATE and waves goodbye . ) FRANK Sounds do-able . And remember , guys . Call me about that golf game . Bye . ( He exits . ) GLENDA Bye . ( JAKE stands dangerously close to the painting . ) JAKE See ya , Frank This speaks to you , honey ? I think I 'll get a little closer to it . To see if I can hear it say something to me . ( He holds up his ear. ) p. 83 GLENDA ( Warningly ) Jake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , that 's what some artists think . JAKE Staring at his brushstrokes , I think I hear him stroking something else GLENDA Please sit down . JAKE You know , this reminds me of someone , too . It looks very familiar . TEDDY I felt the same way  --  JAKE There is something I 'd like to do with this . GLENDA ( Warningly ) Please  --  ( JAKE crosses to the table . He grabs a knife from the place setting . He runs the knife through the painting and slashes it up . This is enormously satisfying to him . The pleasure shows on his face . ) GLENDA Oh my God . Jake . Stop it . KATE ( Standing ) No . Do n't ! MERYL Teddy , stop him . Do something . GLENDA Stop it . You want to do this to me , not the picture . That 's someone 's dream  --  TEDDY Hey  --  ( GLENDA runs to JAKE and holds him , to stop him from slashing. ) p. 84 GLENDA ( Furious ) Jake . Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting . Damn it , I wanted that and now it 's ruined . Totally ruined . TEDDY Honey GLENDA Meryl loved it . I loved it . You 've taken something beautiful and now , it 's all over . Look at it . Look at it . ( She traces it with her fingers . ) It 's in pieces . And he wo n't be able to do the painting again . Not exactly . It will never be the same . JAKE Maybe when he tries it again , it 'll be better . It 'll be something else . Not you . I do n't want any man to know you this way . It 's supposed to be you and me . GLENDA ( Surprised ) That 's the most passion I 've seen in you in years . ( He drops the knife and embraces her . They kiss . ) TEDDY I thought that was going to save our sex life but instead it might save theirs . KATE I thought I 'd buy it to have a companion around the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shut up . ( There 's a pause , as GLENDA and JAKE embrace . After a moment , The MAITRE D ' enters and hands JAKE a price list. ) p. 85 MAITRE D ' ( Refering to the painting ) Would you like to take that with you tonight ? Or shall we arrange to have it sent ? JAKE I want you to throw it out with the garbage , where it belongs . MAITRE D ' Very good , sir . Please write your name , address , and phone number at the bottom of the sheet . ( The MAITRE D ' takes the slashed painting away . JAKE , holding GLENDA 'S hand , starts signing the sheet . ) MERYL That should have been mine . KATE You should 've said something sooner . MERYL That 's the problem . I never say anything . When I should . And then when I do n't get what I want , I 've got no one to blame but myself . TEDDY How much was it ? ( MERYL reaches over and gets the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) TEDDY ( Continued , reading ) Three thousand dollars ? ( He 's shocked ) MERYL It was priceless to me . JAKE ( Sincerely ) Glenda , do n't hang around that guy anymore . I know you 've been posing for him . I ca n't stand it . I hate the thought of another man 's hands all over you , wanting you . We 've had our problems . I 've done some things that I regret . But let 's not give up . I 'll try again if you will . Please . I love you . p. 86 GLENDA I love you , too . ( She takes his hand . They kiss again . ) JAKE Honey , let 's go . ( Puts his arms around her . ) GLENDA ( Surprised ) Now ? JAKE Yes . Will you excuse us ? We 're going to step outside . ( JAKE takes GLENDA 's hand and they exit.A beat . MERYL and KATE look at each other . ) MERYL Wow . I wonder what that means . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KATE It means they do n't need a lawyer after all . You know . I 'm going to go find a phone . I need to leave a message for Frank . I 'll be right back . MERYL There 's a phone in the women 's restroom . KATE Thanks . ( KATE exits towards the bathroom . ) MERYL Well . ( She clears her throat . ) Looks like everyone 's working things out . Jake and Glenda . Kate just went to call Frank . TEDDY That was something , was n't it ? I ca n't believe that Jake would pay $3,000 dollars to run a knife through that guy 's painting . But I guess if your wife is cheating on you , it makes you really mad . I hope we 'll never have to go through anything like that . p. 87 MERYL Teddy . TEDDY What ? MERYL Well TEDDY Oh , no . We 've just had one scene at this place . Ca n't this wait until we get home ? MERYL No . ( Takes a deep breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . TEDDY I 'm not bored . MERYL You 're not ? TEDDY How can I be when we do fun things like this ? ( He indicates the painting . ) MERYL You 're terrified to be alone with me . TEDDY All relationships go through phases . It 's just temporary . MERYL You 're fooling yourself . We 've been in this phase for at least two years . Three years Who knows ? TEDDY You 've been unhappy that long ? MERYL And so have you . Admit it . TEDDY I may have noticed some problems . MERYL We 've got to face it . We ca n't go through life with our heads in the sand . p. 88 TEDDY What are we  --  ostriches ? You relate everything to animals . MERYL Sorry . TEDDY We 're humans . Whatever problems we have , we can work them out , Meryl . So we do n't like to sleep together anymore . So what ? MERYL But I like sex . TEDDY Yeah . I used to like it , too . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem . Because I want children . When are we going to start having children ? TEDDY I do n't feel ready MERYL But I am . We 're not getting any younger . TEDDY Children ca n't be our main focus . We 've got to be happy together before we could bring up kids . MERYL Okay . Then what do we do about it ? TEDDY Focus on us . We need to try to have some fun again . You do n't like to do the same things that you used to . MERYL You 're right . I do n't like to go to sit on the sidelines and cheer you on at softball games . I do n't like to spend Saturday nights with the corporate bowling league . And office parties are n't the thrill they used to be . I do n't live to rent a movie . If you want to do those things , go ahead . But I should n't do it anymore if it makes me unhappy . p. 89 TEDDY Sorry . I ca n't talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rises . ) MERYL Where are you going ? TEDDY I ca n't take this . MERYL ( Rises ) What about dinner ? TEDDY I 'll pay you back . MERYL Ted ! That 's not what I meant . Please . Come back . ( He exits . He passes KATE as she comes out of the bathroom . She watches him walk past . MERYL sits back down at the table . KATE sits with her . They sit in numbed silence for a moment . ) KATE Are we the only ones left ? MERYL Uh  --  huh . KATE You okay ? MERYL ( Shrugs ) I want to try and get what I want . And Ted 's got to do the same thing . It 's the only way either one of us will get better . KATE I tried to beep Frank . No answer . I left a message on his machine . I told him that I was moving out . Maybe I 'll fax him . MERYL What ? KATE I need to try it . p. 90 MERYL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big step Where will you go ? To Michael 's ? KATE No . No . I 'm going to find my own place . At least for awhile . MERYL Good . Good for you . KATE So now . How about you ? MERYL Things are changing . I know that much . KATE Maybe Glenda knows what she wants . MERYL And if she does , good for her , too . If it 's Jake KATE If ( A pause . ) But I want to find out what works for me . What I want ( THE MAITRE D ' enters . ) MAITRE D ' I see we 've grown smaller here . I guess the mussels did the trick . ( He removes the plates from around the table . ) We often find there are those who ca n't make it through the appetizers to enjoy the entrees . It 's sad , but it 's really quite common . I 'll cancel the other orders . Is there anything else right now ? MERYL Yes . I do n't want an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last time , we did n't have any . MAITRE D ' Indeed . That was your mistake . Our desserts are the best . Shall I tell you about them now ? p. 91 MERYL Please . ( The MAITRE D ' looks around the restaurant , then circles around their table . ) MAITRE D ' Dessert is a usually sweet course served at the end . But one must really think about what that means . It 's a paradox , like all things in life . It 's sweet , but it signifies the end . How can that be ? How can it be happy and sad ? How can we celebrate the end ? It 's because we know that just because something 's over does n't mean it was n't great , that it was n't worth doing . Sometimes the sweetest things in the world , the things we most want to savor , come at the end . We chew slowly . We relish the sugar . Our tongues catch chocolate crumbs . But eventually the cream is gone . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafe au lait , by slicing our cheese ever so thinly . But finally , we all put down the fork , the knife , the spoon . We leave the table and go out into the dark night . And then tomorrow , we 're up with the sun and we eat again . You see ? So dessert at Delicacies is our most favorite course to serve . We pride ourselves on recognizing the unique function dessert has in the life of our patrons . The bittersweet end that we must savor and love Tonight , we have one dessert . It is delectable . Scrumptious . A luxurious delicacy . It 's called Eve 's Apple Delight . MERYL I 've never had that before . p. 92 KATE Neither have I. MERYL I like the sound of it . I 'd love to try it . KATE I 'd like one , too . And please cancel my entree as well . MAITRE D ' Very good . MERYL But no hurry . MAITRE D ' As you wish . MERYL I 've got the whole evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAITRE D ' smiles . ) MAITRE D ' I 'll inform the chef of your excellent decision and I 'll be back with your just desserts . ( He exits . ) KATE You know , this was your idea , Meryl Sugarman . And it was the best idea you 've ever had . MERYL So far . KATE So far . MERYL Thanks . Funny . Twice feels like enough . I do n't think we 'll be coming back to Delicacies again . KATE No So let 's enjoy it . MERYL All right . ( She raises her glass . ) A toast . To dessert . To us . Let 's really savor it . This time . KATE To dessert and us . Bon choisi . ( They clink glasses . Tableaux . Then : )
