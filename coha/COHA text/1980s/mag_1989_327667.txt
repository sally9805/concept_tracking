The front is just outside Kabul . From the center of the city , it is easy to spot a series of outposts  --  small , mud-walled fortresses  --  on the snowy mountaintops that ring the capital . Soviet and Afghan troops man the redoubts around the clock , watching for guerrilla movement in the valleys beyond . As soon as mujahedin activity is spotted , Soviet artillery goes into action , and the boom of outgoing fire echoes through the city . <P> The defense of Kabul , however , is undergoing its biggest change since the Soviets invaded Afghanistan a decade ago . Having already withdrawn most of its 115,000-strong invasion force , Moscow has now begun pulling out the last of the estimated 15,000 troops who form the Kabul garrison and defend the corridor north to the Soviet border . By Feb. 15 , the last Soviet soldier is scheduled to be gone from Afghanistan , and the Afghan military will bear sole responsibility for the security of the capital as well as the rest of the country . <P> Then the question will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Najibullah will fall . Though all the country 's major cities are still under government control , Kandahar and Jalalabad , two of the five largest , have seen their defenses crumble under mujahedin attacks . Moscow insists it is determined to ensure the survival of Najibullah 's government , but nearly all diplomats in Kabul believe the regime will collapse within months , perhaps even weeks , of Feb. 15 . As the prospect of a bloody siege grew last week , U.S. Secretary of State James Baker ordered the closing of the American embassy in Kabul and told the eight U.S. diplomats still in Afghanistan to leave the country . The British , French , Italians and Japanese * decided to follow suit and announced that they would be withdrawing their diplomats from Afghanistan . <P> Though Kabul has not yet come under consistent , heavy military barrage , the city is vulnerable to attacks that may cut the Salang Highway , the 264-mile road that climbs the towering Hindu Kush and crosses long stretches of mujahedin-controlled territory to the Soviet border . In a move to push the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops last week shelled villages south of the Salang Tunnel , killing hundreds of civilians and refugees . <P> The Soviet pullback from the capital began about three weeks ago , even as Yuli Vorontsov , the Soviet Ambassador to Afghanistan and a Deputy Foreign Minister , threatened that Moscow would halt the withdrawal if the mujahedin leadership did not accept some participation by Najibullah 's People 's Democratic Party of Afghanistan ( P.D.P.A. ) in a shura , or council of leaders , that would choose a new government . The mujahedin , smelling a bluff , would not budge , and the pullout from Kabul continued . <P> Ilyushin-76 transport flights in and out of the capital are running at a dozen a day , many carrying Soviet soldiers home . Two large Soviet bases north of the city are deserted . The main Soviet hospital has been turned over to Afghans , and Moscow has reduced its embassy staff by two-thirds , to about 100 people . Soviet infantrymen still patrol Kabul 's streets , but they expect to be home within days . " It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central shopping area . " And we are never coming back . It is up to the Afghan people to find a solution to their problems . "
