<P> New ordeal for Shcharansky <P> <P> The 400 Jews who gathered in a Jerusalem park last week to commemorate the 34th birthday of Soviet Dissenter Anatoli Shcharansky were more in a mood for lamentation than for celebration . The group , which included his wife Avital , discussed Shcharansky 's new ordeals in prison , then trudged through the city on a pilgrimage to the Western Wall , where prayers were offered for Shcharansky 's health , his release from captivity and his arrival in Israel . <P> The ceremony reflected renewed concern about Shcharansky , who became a world-renowned political prisoner and a symbol of official Soviet anti-Semitism following his well-publicized trial in 1978 . A champion of human rights in the U.S.S.R. , he had been made the victim of a trumped-up treason case . Shcharansky was accused of spying for the U.S. and sentenced to three years in prison and ten in a hard-labor camp , despite his denial and President Jimmy Carter 's categorical refutation of the charges . <P> For the past year , the Soviets have singled him out for punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Shcharansky in early January his mother , Ida Milgrom , reported : " He looked so pale and so thin . For one year he has been starving . If he remains in this present situation he wo n't survive . " <P> <P> During 1981 , Shcharansky was often kept on a 1,300-to 1,400-calorie meatless diet consisting of some fish , cabbage , potatoes , bread and cereal , plus minute amounts of flour , oil and tomato paste . On alternate days he received only bread , hot water and salt . Shcharansky , who weighed about 134 Ibs. at the time of his arrest in 1977 , was down to about 110 Ibs . He was hospitalized for 33 days at the end of the summer . According to his mother , Shcharansky was subsequently sentenced to spend three more years in prison instead of spending this time in labor camp . <P> The persecution of Shcharansky is part of a pattern of increasingly severe treatment of dissidents , Jews and other ethnic minorities that has coincided with the deterioration of U.S.-Soviet relations . Soviet leaders have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of Jews allowed to emigrate . By the end of 1981 emigration had dropped to an average of 380 people a month , an 82% decline over the previous two years . One of those allowed to emigrate earlier was Avital Shcharansky , 31 , who met Secretary of State Alexander Haig during his trip to Israel two weeks ago . He promised her that he would raise Shcharansky 's case with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko when they meet in Geneva this week .
