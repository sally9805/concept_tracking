A Prelude to Death in Venice is a play in one act for a Character , BILL , and a Voice . Both Character and Voice " characterize " and " voice " themselves in different ways . Some of these ways are implied in the dialogue and others elaborated in the " Playwright 's Note " at the beginning of the text . This note is not meant to encroach upon the director 's province . It documents one set of solutions to the problems of staging posed by the text . On the street at night , JOHN GREED , a puppet , manipulated by BILL , stands at two touchtone PAY PHONES designated I and II . JOHN wears a leather bomber jacket , levis and a blue knit watch-cap . BILL wears a " wino tux " ( old black suit jacket , white shirt  --  open neck , levis , western boots , a knit cap similar to JOHN 's . ) BILL 's BILL 's voice is JOHN 's voice as well as his own .

HE listens ) PHONE II ( VOICE as Mercury Message , imitating Thomas Mann ) Gustave Aschenbach  --  or Von Aschenbach , as he had been known officially since his fiftieth birthday  --  had set out alone from his house in Prince Regent Street , Munich , for an extended walk . JOHN presses a number on the touchtone dial of PHONE I. PHONE II ( VOICE as Mercury Message , continued ) Aschenbach had sought the open soon after tea . JOHN presses three more numbers which play the opening phrase of Bach 's " Toccata and Fugue in D Minor . " p. 14 PHONE II ( VOICE as Mercury Message , continued ) He was overwrought by a morning of hard nerve-taxing work A recording of the " Toccata and Fugue in D Minor " underscores the remaining portion of the quote from Mann 's Death in Venice . JOHN , in a " dumb show , " appears to play it on the touchtone dials. expanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II ( VOICE as Mercury Message , continued ) work which had not ceased to exact his uttermost in the way of sustained concentration , conscientiousness , and tact ; and after the noon meal he found himself powerless to check the onward sweep of the productive mechanism within him , that " motus animi continuus " in which , according to Cicero , eloquence resides . He had sought but not found relaxation in sleep  --  though the wear and tear upon his system had come to make a daily nap more and more imperative  --  and now undertook a walk , in the hope that air and exercise might bring him back refreshed to a good evening 's work . Bach pauses . JOHN bows , acknowledging applause . Then Bach continues . PHONE II ( VOICE as Mercury Message , continued ) May had begun , and after weeks of cold and wet a mock summer had set in . The English Gardens , though in tenderest leaf , felt as sultry as in August and by the time he reached the North Cemetery he felt tired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a storm was brewing over Fhring . Music pauses . p. 15 JOHN GREED ( On PHONE II ) Fhring ? PHONE II ( VOICE as Mercury Message , still imitating Thomas Mann ) Ja , Fhring . Bach and JOHN 's dumb show continue . The TELEPHONES rise , their poles elongating  --  the scene is lit as a holy tableau . JOHN climbs up his " cross of telephones " and hangs between them , still listening . VOICE as Mercury Message imitating Thomas Mann continues throughout . PHONE II ( VOICE as Mercury Message , continued ) A mortuary chapel in Byzantine style stood silent in the gleam of the ebbing day . Its facade was adorned with scriptural texts in gilded letters bearing upon the future life , such as : " They are entering into the House of the Lord " and " May the Light Everlasting shine upon them . " Aschenbach let his mind 's eye lose itself in these mystical formulas . He was brought back to reality by the sight of a figure standing in the portico above two apocalyptic beasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucified on the TELEPHONES . PHONE II ( VOICE as Mercury Message , continued ) The figure kindled his fantasy . He felt a kind of vaulting unrest . A youthful ardent thirst for distant scenes  --  a feeling so new , or at least so long ago outgrown and forgot , coming upon him with such suddenness and passion as to resemble a seizure . The image of TADZIO , the Bach and the holy lighting conspire to seduce JOHN . Volumes and intensities rise . p. 16 PHONE II ( VOICE as Mercury Message , continued ) He beheld a landscape , a tropical marshland full of islands , morasses , and alluvial channels JOHN hangs up PHONES . Silence and momentary tableau . Then the TELEPHONES descend bringing JOHN back to earth . JOHN dials PHONE I. JOHN GREED ( On PHONE I ) " Johns Anonymous . " Well , look in the commercial listings . It 's not in the commercial listings ? I just got it from the commercial listings . Well , give me the supervisor . There 's no supervisor ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's not my dime ! " ( Hangs up ) JOHN GREED ( To BILL ) You got another dime ? BILL shakes his head . JOHN GREED ( To BILL , continued ) What do you mean , " You do n't got another dime ! " Anxious pause until PHONE I rings . JOHN GREED ( Answering PHONE I ) " Johns Anonymous ! " Whew How 'd you get my number ? Oh you called my Mother . Now she 's giving out my number . I was picking up my messages . Sometimes you get long messages . Tom called . " Tom , " man . " Tom ! " Well , it 's not hard to understand  --  the word is out , " I want to shoot in Venice " ; he 's pushing a script . Why should I mind ? I do n't write my scripts . I 'm a " shooter " by profession  --  that 's what I profess  --  I mean , I 'm a " straight shooter . " My problems lie in the area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Life " onto my dog . I made a mistake ; it was a conceptual error . No , the problem was , this small domestic animal projected " Beauty and the Beast " right back on me . I was perceived . I perceived myself perceived . Right . I perceived I was not just some " Tom " " Dick " or " Harry . " No , I was a " Jean . " Right . I perceived that I , myself , was not a self-supporting system . I was a reactive system . I followed the action  --  all I needed was a little action . I followed other dogs ; I panned around looking for little pussy cats ; I zoomed in on a gerbil once because she thought I looked like Steve McQueen . Then I realized that my shooting was affected . I discovered that my shooting was affected shooting a long shot on Twenty-Third Street . Formerly , when shooting , light entered my aperture , through my lens , and left an image right between my sprocket holes . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other way and leaves my image on Twenty-Third Street . This was detailed in an article by Annette Michaelson called " The Greed Effect "  --  that 's how it 's referred to in the Industry today ; in other circles it 's called " The Miracle of Twenty-Third Street "  --  it depends on your circle . Well , frankly , I had a creative crisis  --  three shots a day , then two , for a while there I was down to eighteen frames a week on Sunday afternoons . Then I cut out color . There I was down to black and white , I 'd wake up in the morning with the shakes , my hair came out . I went on a bender ; I shot two reels of " Todd AO " with quadrophonic sound . Afterwards , I was hospitalized . I emerged from the hospital a changed John . I was a " Mark . " " You 're a junkie , John , " they told me , " you 've got to go cold cock . " I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found myself . I 'm hooked on my reality . Now , I 'm afraid to fade . My self is my vacation . " What can I do ? I go into myself . I become self involved . I try to be self effacing . But , that 's self defeating . I indulge in self recrimination . But , all that does is make me more self centered . I long to be self transcending . But , this becomes too self deluding , which brings me to the brink of self destruction , which becomes a subject of self concern . Am I being self indulgent ? Good . Good . Just checking . You got to help me , man , I 'm going down the garden path  --  self assertion , then , self direction , then I get just plain old selfish  --  afterwhich followeth self possession . I 'm beside myself . That 's the Pale Horse , man . I 'm on the edge . I 'm on the edge of being a " self made , " man . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dialogue , first to BILL and then to the OPERATORS ( local and transatlantic ) , is improvisationally interjected into the pauses and over the lines of the Johns Anonymous monologue . The sequences begin at the points where they are inserted . p. 17 PHONE I ( VOICE as Johns Anonymous ) John , let me tell you the story of my life . My fucking did not start until after I was thirty-five , and a fairly successful career had been established . My success brought increased social activities , and I realized that many of my friends enjoyed a social fuck with no apparent harm to themselves or others . I disliked being different , so , ultimately , I began to join them occasionally . JOHN GREED ( To BILL ) You got about thirty-four dollars ? I got to call Luxembourg . BILL shakes his head . JOHN GREED ( To Bill , continued ) Thanks anyway , my man , I 'll call collect . You got a dime ? Thanks , man . PHONE I ( VOICE as Johns Anonymous , continued ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I started looking forward to my weekend of golf and the nineteenth hole . Gradually the quantity increased ; the occasions for fucking came more frequently  --  a hard day , worries and pressures , had news , good news  --  there were more and more reasons to fuck . It was frightening . Fucking was being substituted for more and more of the things I really enjoyed doing . Golf , hunting , and fishing were , now merely excuses to fuck excessively . p. 18 JOHN GREED ( Dialing transatlantic operator on PHONE II ) Get me the cable . Dime comes back . JOHN GREED ( On PHONE II , continued ) Thanks , man . The Transatlantic Cable . ( Pause ) Informazione Luxembourg Je voudrait unt numer telefoon . Si . Lieba Stoed . Yah ! " Es " " tay " " oh " " ooh " " day . " Ja . O.K. Bon d'accord . Mit umlaut . Thanks , man . PHONE I ( VOICE as Johns Anonymous , continued ) I made promises to myself , my family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in heavy fucking . I tried to hide my fucking by going places where I was unlikely to see anyone I knew . Remorse was always with me . The next steps were closet fucking and excuses for trips in order to fuck without restraint  --  what it does to a person is apparent to everyone but the person involved . JOHN GREED ( On PHONE II ) Achtung ! Hey ACHTUNG ! Collectare . PHONE I ( VOICE as Johns Anonymous , continued ) When it became noticeable to the point of comment , I devised ways of sneaking fucks on the side . Rehearsals became part of the pattern  --  stopping to fuck on the way to the place where I was planning to fuck  --  never having enough , always craving more ; the obsession to fuck gradually dominated my entire life . p. 19 JOHN GREED ( On PHONE II ) Allo ! Prego ! Pronto ! Attenzione ! What 's happening ! She wo n't accept ? She rejects ? Man , she do n't understand , I live on the edge . PHONE I ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on numerous occasions but I always felt unhappy and abused . I tried psychiatry but , of course , I gave the psychiatrist no cooperation . I was living in constant fear that I would get caught fucking while driving a car , so , I used taxis part of the time . Eventually , my entire personality changed to a cynical , arrogant , intolerant person , completely different from my normal self . JOHN GREED ( On PHONE II ) O.K. , bill it to my home number . My home number  --  " nine one one . " It 's an emergency . PHONE I ( VOICE as Johns Anonymous , continued ) I was full of self pity . I resented anyone and everyone who tried to get in my way . It seemed to me that my wife was becoming more intolerant and narrow-minded all the time ; whenever we went out she appeared to go out of her way to keep me from having more than one fuck  --  she , of course , did n't realize how cunning a john can be . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our children to bring their friends home at any time , but , after a few experiences with a fucking father they eliminated home as a place to entertain their friends . I 'll never know all the people I hurt , all the friends I abused , the humiliation of my family ; we think we can fuck to excess without anyone knowing it  --  everybody knows it p. 20 JOHN GREED ( On PHONE II ) Hello . Lieba ? Sorry . Where am I ? I 'm on the street . Where are you ? On the bidet . PHONE II beeps . JOHN GREED ( On PHONE II . continued ) Sorry . Well , the point is  --  Freddie Laker .

" BILL turns Downstage , laughs , and pulls JOHN 's jacket off his hands with his teeth , separating himself from the puppet . BILL and JOHN dance ballroom style . BILL bites JOHN on the neck like a vampire . Telephone lights change from white to red . Fog seeps in . BILL lays " dead JOHN " down on the curb propped against the PHONE I post . Then HE crouches Upstage  --  out of sight lines , except for a hand which appears , now , to be JOHN 's . It gestures minimally , as HE speaks to the image of a DRACULA that has appeared where , previously , the image of TADZIO had been . Music continues . BILL ( Continued ) : Hi , Sucker . What do you mean you 're not home free ? Well frankly , Pop , I 'm shocked that you , of all people , are not home free ; in fact , I 'm shocked you 're even home at all . Do n't you usually wing it till sunrise before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you filed an affidavit that I 'm not an Equal Opportunity Employer . You stated that I discriminate against the dead . You work for me , Sucker . Do n't you ever forget it ! Hey , Pop , you 're out for blood , are n't you ? I understand , I really do  --  it 's a hook . I 'm telling you , " Eat those chocolate covered cherries . " They 're just as good . I left a whole box for you under the wolfbane . I said , " Eat those chocolate covered cherries ! " " Eat those chocolate covered cherries . They 're just as good ! Good ! Good ! " Just vamping Music and lights start to fade . p. 27 BILL ( Continued ) You 're suffering from claustrophobia ? Pop I 'm sorry You have to what you have to open the lid and look at the sky ? That 's dangerous . I mean  --  anybody just driving by with a stake and hammer Your soul ? seeks the light ? That 's so weird , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daybreak sets the alarm for my soul at two a.m . We hardly have a thing in common anymore . I 'm sorry too . There 's nothing to say  --  you know what I 'm saying ? I 'm just " vamping . " We 're vamping , Sucker , you and me . We do n't have a thing in common anymore . The image of the DRACULA disppears and a VAMPIRE BAT descends and perches on PHONE I booth . BILL reappears . BILL ( continued ) We do ? ( BILL 's hand disassociates from JOHN , entirely de-animating the puppet , which HE disposes of out of sightlines ) Uh huh uh huh uh huh hey , do you mind if I bum one of those chocolate covered cherries ? ( BILL materializes the cherry magically , unwraps it and eats ) Thanks , man . ( BILL assumes JOHN 's position against PHONE I ) Uh huh well , why do n't we have lunch sometime  --  a late lunch . Who would you like to eat ? Well , it 's business too  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two states  --  " yours " and " mine . " I want to work up a joint proposal . I need a little subsidy . Yeah , that 's my point  --  supernatural subsidy . Well , you know the people , man I mean shit , man , you know Croesus . Right now I 'm just a piece of chalk on the blackborad of myth . You got another chocolate covered cherry ? ( Again BILL materializes the cherry magically , unwraps it and eats ) Thanks , man . Well , I was going to wait to get into this over lunch , but , if you 've got a minute , I could pitch it to you . All I want is a " development deal . " Uh huh and pursuant to our previous discussion , Pop , I want to shoot in Venice . PLEASE . Thanks , man I want to shoot you sitting in the fog , on a bench , on a beach in Venice . We 'll use fact film ' cause there 's not much light . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm down inside your overcoat like a kangaroo in a pocket . Well , that 's my shot . Yeah , that 's my point  --  it 's a " lap " dissolve . You got another cherry ? ( Again BILL materializes the cherry magically , unwraps it and eats ) Thanks , man . I want your shoes off , and your feet in the sand , and your eyes on the water , and your hair in the fog . You know , it 's Venice before the mist burns off  --  it 's " vamping " weather . ( BILL sits between PHONES facing the street  --  Upstage ) And I say to you , Pop , " How do you do . " How does a " doer " do or die And you say , " You vait for de sun , son , like any uder sucker . " Now dissolve to the sun . The sun appears in the night sky over the street . p. 28 BILL ( Continued ) The sun comes right down Pico Boulevard beating every yellow light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Music , lights and effects fade ) I want to die in my father 's arms looking at the sea . Repeat after me BILL sings to the tune of " Row , row , row your boat . " The VOICE , as a child , joins the round faintly . BILL ( Continued ) I want to die in my father 's arms looking at the sea . I want to die in my father 's arms . Repeat after me Round repeats . Music barely audible , lights and effects out . BILL silhouetted at the window . BILL ( Continued ) Yeah well , just bring along one of your standard contracts . Yeah yeah , I 'll sign in blood . VAMPIRE BAT files off . BILL ( Continued ) Jesus Christ what a primitive ( BILL calls through the window into the street )
