DETROIT  --  General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union reached a tentative agreement on a new three-year contract , likely averting a strike once thought inevitable . Neither side would disclose the terms of the pact , but officials from both sides said the union won a contract with job security and pay provisions largely similar to the one reached last month at Ford Motor Co . GM fought for differences , arguing that it is in a less-competitive position than Ford . But the struggling auto maker apparently gave in after deciding the differences weren ' t worth the cost  --  either in lost production or damaged labor-management relations  --  of a walkout . Early in the negotiations , GM pushed hard for lower pay for workers in plants deemed uncompetitive , especially some parts plants . But that concept , too , apparently fell by the wayside . The pact may get a negative review on Wall Street , however , where analysts have said GM needs a contract tailored to its specific problems . That view may change as GM explains the accord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday . In composite New York Stock Exchange trading , GM closed at $76. 25 , down $2 . If the contract gets the expected approval from various UAW committees and ratification by the rank and file , it will mean remarkable labor peace for the auto industry this year , tracking a recent nationwide trend of fewer strikes . It now appears that the only work stoppage will have been a brief six-day walkout at Chrysler Corp. in Canada . ( GM ' s Canadian unit still faces negotiations , but difficulties aren ' t expected . Chrysler ' s U.S. contract doesn ' t expire until next year . ) The agreement may prove expensive to live with over time , but the harmonious negotiations at least provide desperately needed good news for the No. 1 auto maker , which has been battered in recent months with eroding market share and plunging earnings . Indeed , the contract was put together with less than a week of intense bargaining , and without even a formal deadline , or " scratch in the sand , " as UAW President Owen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon news conference announcing the settlement , praised the content of the pact , saying it will " achieve job security for our GM membership and make stable employment a part of the way this corporation does business . " GM Chairman Roger B. Smith followed Mr. Bieber to the podium and praised the agreement as something that " will strengthen the partnership between General Motors and all of its employees . " Those familiar with the pact said that GM agreed to all the major principles of the Ford job-security plan . GM promised not to lay off any of its 335 , 000 active UAW workers during the contract except during a sales drop ; to replace half the workers lost through attrition ; and not to close any plants other than the 16 already announced . GM agreed to back the job-security plan with $1. 3 billion . With more than three times Ford ' s 104 , 000 active workers , that would be less than proportionate to the $500 million limit Ford set . But one source said GM had agreed to other job-security expenditures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study ways to improve productivity in each plant , but it made no guarantees . In pay , GM agreed to give all workers a 3% base-wage raise in the first year of the contract and 3% lump-sum payments in the last two years , matching Ford ' s commitment . The auto maker pushed hard to get some special breaks Ford didn ' t , mainly because GM makes many more parts than Ford does , and it argues that many of those operations aren ' t competitive . GM is also less efficient in comparable facilities than Ford , and it says it needs to trim its work force more . But GM may have found enough flexibility to live with , if not like . Specifically , the plant-closing " ban " may not cover facilities that would be shut because of " consolidations . " And the requirement to replace workers lost through attrition can be waived in certain circumstances , such as employee buy-outs . GM is likely to use such buy-outs more frequently than Ford , one source said , so it likely will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GM also hopes to get major productivity improvements through work-rule changes in its plants , particularly its parts operations . But altering decades-old work practices is a political hot potato , and it was the most contentious part of the Ford agreement . While many union leaders say certain restrictive job classifications are archaic and meaningless , others say they are important protections for workers . Even so , GM may suffer a certain loss of face on Wall Street . Many securities analysts have said that job guarantees and pay raises too similar to Ford ' s would only make the limping auto maker less competitive . Those comments were made , however , before details of the agreement were available . Though it sounds sweeping , the job-security plan agreed to marks more an evolution than a revolution over previous contracts . In 1984 , GM agreed to protect workers whose jobs disappeared because of productivity , technology , and the transfer of work to other companies , a practice commonly called outsourcing . The only major factor left uncovered was a sales drop , and the new contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event . But the union feels the new plan marks a significant shift in tone . Before , it appeared the company had the right to lay anybody off , and the union had to prove why the workers should be protected . Now , the burden has shifted to the company to show why it should be allowed to lay someone off . Auto labor pacts often set a pattern for other negotiations around the country . This year ' s GM and Ford contracts reflect the growing importance of job security over money . Some industry officials say the auto companies will be more inclined to build certain products in-house as a result of the pacts . Also , by asking the companies to stanch attrition , the UAW made clear that it ' s concerned about the stability of the union itself , as well the security of individual workers . The negotiations also reflect the closer ties between the union and the companies . The contracts include more joint union-management programs that enhance worker involvement . They also include more flexibility , where the true value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work together . Another indication of the new relationship was the ability to make it through without a strike . Within the last year , GM infuriated its workers by announcing a $5 billion stock buy-back , $169 million in executive bonuses , and a $750 million buy-out of dissident director H. Ross Perot  --  all while telling workers they wouldn ' t get profit sharing and that the company would have to close a dozen plants . At that point , many industry and union officials , as well as analysts , projected a long , bitter GM walkout . But the union decided to negotiate first with Ford . And when the two sides failed to come to terms when the contract expired Sept. 14 , they agreed to an unprecedented day-by-day extension , rather than call a strike .
