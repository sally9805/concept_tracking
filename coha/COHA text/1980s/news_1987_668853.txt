The new tax law contains a provision that forces home sellers to report their profits to the Internal Revenue Service right away , even if no tax is owed . While this may seem like a lot of bother , you can look at it from a positive point of view , as the IRS does :  --  The government will get an estimated $250 million more in taxes annually than it now collects from home transactions , since many homeowners have failed to report their profits in the past.  --  Filing a report every time you move gives you a record that is likely to come in handy some day in case you have to add how much you owe the government . It ' s a fairly complex process , involving figures from every house you ' ve ever owned . Here ' s how it works : The Nelsons buy their first house for $100 , 000 , paying closing costs of $8 , 000 . They add on a room costing $12 , 000 before they sell the house six years later for $180 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $15 , 000 . To calculate the gain , the Nelsons must first figure out their " basis , " which is the price they paid for the house , plus any closing costs , legal fees and the cost of permanent improvements . In their case , that ' s $100 , 000 for the house , $8 , 000 in closing costs and $12 , 000 in improvements  --  a total of $120 , 000 . Next , they take the sales price of the house , $180 , 000 , and subtract any closing costs  --  in this case , $15 , 000  --  which gives them the " adjusted sales price " of $165 , 000 . Their profit is the adjusted sales price realized minus the basis  --  $165 , 000 minus $120 , 000 , or $45 , 000 . This profit must be reported to the IRS by the closing agent at the sale of the property , usually the lender or title company . The Nelsons will not have to pay taxes on that $45 , 000 right away as long as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale . The tax is deferred , but under the new law it must be reported to the IRS anyway . In this case , the Nelsons qualify for the deferral with the purchase of a house for $225 , 000 , with closing costs of $10 , 000 . Ten years later , they sell that house for $300 , 000 . Closing costs on the sale come to $25 , 000 . The " basis " of the second home is figured differently than the basis on the first home . It is the price and closing costs of the second home  --  $235 , 000  --  minus the profit on the first home  --  $45 , 000  --  or $190 , 000 . Subtract that figure from the adjusted sales price of the second home ( $300 , 000 minus closing costs of $25 , 000 leaves an adjusted sales price of $275 , 000 ) . The profit on the second house is thus $85 , 000 ( $275 , 000 minus $190 , 000 ) . Taxes on this profit can be deferred as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they sell a house after reaching age 55 , they have the option of taking a once-in-a lifetime tax exclusion of $125 , 000 on the accumulated profits from their home sales  --  as long as they have lived in their last home for three of the previous five years . This one-time exclusion has meant that most people never had to pay tax on the profits they made from home sales . But with the median price of a new home in the United States now at $110 , 000 and property values rising steadily in many places , many middle-class families may find their profits exceed this limit by the time they are 55 . Thus it is a good idea to keep careful records on each of your home purchases and sales , including prices , closing costs and improvements you make on each . You can not add routine fix-up costs to the basis , but you can subtract them from the " amount realized " if you do the work within 90 days of selling the house to make it more attractive to buyers. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
