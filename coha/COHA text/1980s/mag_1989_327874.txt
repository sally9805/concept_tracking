War , being a pretty depressing human endeavor , has never been a favorite subject for network entertainment . The Viet Nam War , being pretty depressing even as wars go , would seem to be nearly untouchable . Not only was there too much R-rated action ( drug abuse , massacres of civilians ) but the story had an unhappy ending . Such recent movies as Platoon and Full Metal Jacket could immerse their audience in the muck and moral quicksand for a couple of hours and then let go . But TV series must keep viewers coming back week after week , adhering to standards of " family entertainment " along the way . <P> The surprise , then , is that two weekly shows about Viet Nam have established themselves on the prime-time schedule . To be sure , both of them  --  CBS 's Tour of Duty and ABC 's China Beach  --  add plenty of TV fabric softener to the abrasive material . Each fills its sound track with ' 60s pop songs , as if Viet Nam were just another trip down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the malt shop . Both have taken a predominantly male experience and leavened it with female characters and soap-opera story lines closer to Dallas than Saigon . <P> China Beach revolves around a **26;7660;TOOLONG complex near Danang , and its protagonists range from a dedicated nurse ( Dana Delany ) to a hard-bitten war profiteer ( Marg Helgenberger ) . Tour of Duty focuses on an all- male combat platoon , but this season has added two prominent female characters  --  a wire-service reporter and a psychiatrist  --  and , of course , a love interest for each . <P> Yet credit is due : no other dramatic shows on TV deal with such relentlessly uncheery subject matter . Tour of Duty is the more conventional of the two , an L.A. Law-style mix of characters , subplots and issues that are introduced and neatly resolved by episode 's end . The show 's flaws are familiar : characters who are too simplistic ( the hotdogging helicopter pilot , the streetwise black private ) , and plot twists that are too patly " illuminating . " When a battle- fatigued soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the objections of his sergeant and a psychiatrist  --  you can bet that five minutes into his first mission he will go berserk and get shot . Still , the show has broached some touchy subjects , from officer corruption to cowardice in battle , with honesty and dramatic fluency . <P> If Tour of Duty is the war genre 's L.A. Law , China Beach is its thirtysomething : narratively loose jointed , laced with ironic dialogue and moody introspection . Created by John Sacret Young ( screenwriter of A Rumor of War ) and former magazine editor William Broyles Jr. , the show lurches between the fey ( a macho war hero parachutes into camp and romances all the women ) and % the loquaciously self-important , as if it were a sorority bull session with grenade sound effects . But the writing is a notch above standard-issue TV fare , and the show follows its own adventurous , if sometimes bumpy , path .
