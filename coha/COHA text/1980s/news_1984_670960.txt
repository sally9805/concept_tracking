A century after he arrived penniless on the docks of New York City , Tesla is receiving credit for brilliant achievements that outdid those of his contemporaries , Edison and Marconi . And more than 40 years after the recluse died in a Manhattan hotel room , in the company of the pigeons who were his favorite companions in the final years of his life , he is at last being elevated to the pantheon of the world ' s great inventors. // It was Nikola Tesla , not Marconi , who invented the first radio ; it was Tesla , not Edison , who devised the system of electric power disribution now used throughout the world . Working in small laboratories in midtown Manhattan and Greenwich Village , Tesla invented the polyphase electric motor , the bladeless steam turbine and the radio-guided torpedo . Some scientists say it was Tesla who first conceived ideas for a " Star Wars " type of military shield in space. // To help analyze and publicize the accomplishments of the reclusive genius , a group of scientists and engineers have formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized a museum exhibition and persuaded the Governor of Colorado to dedicate the month of August to Tesla. // " He helped spawn the industrial revolution , " said Toby Grotz , chairman of the Tesla Centennial Committee and an engineer at Martin Marietta Aerospace in Denver . " It couldn ' t have happened without him . He came from a period when a single individual could still change the course of history. " // The centennial events have largely taken place in Colorado , where the inventor had built a laboratory to create huge bolts of artificial lightning. // " We ' re trying to bring his name to its rightful prominence , " said William H. Terbo , who is Tesla ' s great-nephew and honorary chairman of the Tesla Memorial Society. // The proceedings of the symposium will be published by the New York-based Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers , the world ' s largest such society. // The committee says conventional histories all too often dismiss Tesla in a few paragraphs . Indeed , the usual story is quite short. // Tesla was born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and soon showed a talent for invention and tinkering . In 1884 , he took a ship to New York and immediately went to work for Thomas Alva Edison . But the two quickly parted ways after a dispute over an invention. // Going into business for himself , Tesla soon developed the basis for the alternating-current system in worldwide use today . He realized that direct current can be transported over wires for only a few miles , whereas high-voltage alternating current can go on almost forever without sustaining great losses of power . To make the new system practical , he invented and patented a variety of alternating- current generators , transformers and motors. // Edison backed direct current as the perfect electrical source of the future , and the two men fought a heated battle over the best system . It went down in science history as the " war of the currents " - a contest Tesla won. // <> <> Conceived Futuristic Devices So much for Tesla ' s conventional history . The Centennial Committee says he went on to do much more than just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dazzling array of futuristic devices. // " All the literature says Marconi invented the radio , " Mr. Grotz said in an interview . " But long before Marconi had a patent , Tesla was demonstrating a radio-controlled model boat and talking about transmitting electrical power across the Atlantic . Compare that to Marconi ' s S-O-S. " // Indeed , in 1943 the Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States overturned Marconi ' s patent because they found it had been preceded by Tesla ' s practical achievements in radio transmission. // Another example is radar , which employs short wavelength radio signals that can be reflected back from solid objects . As early as 1900 , members of the centennial committee note , Tesla suggested that these wavelengths could be used for locating ships at sea. // Many of the 27 speakers at the Tesla symposium , held this month at The Colorado College in Colorado Springs , put their emphasis on Tesla ' s most spectacular experiments of all , which occurred at a laboratory not far from the symposium site . There , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generated 10 million to 12 million volts of electricity and sent bolts of artificial lightning flashing 135 feet through the air , a feat that has never been equaled. // <> <> Work Shrouded in Mystery // To this day , scientists debate what Tesla accomplished in Colorado , for much of the work was shrouded in mystery . Dr. Robert W. Bass , an electrical engineer with Litton Industries , said at the symposium that one of Tesla ' s more controversial claims - that he had created ball lightning - was probably true and he cited contemporary theories of physics to explain how Tesla could reproduce such a rare natural phenomonon. // Tesla ' s laboratory in Colorado Springs was a barn-like structure that sat atop a hill on the prairie and was crowned by an 80-foot tower and beyond that a 122-foot mast . The tall fence surrounding it carried signs reading : " Keep Out - Great Danger . " The claps of thunder from his bolts of artificial lightning could be heard for miles. // According to Charles Wright , a retired engineer formerly with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a host of inventions including high-voltage transformers , dynamos , coils , capacitor- discharge devices , oil-insulated capacitors and a large metered control panel. // In Colorado Tesla hit upon what he thought was a revolutionary way to send electricity through the air . " Not only was it practicable to send telegraphic messages to any distance without wires , " he wrote of the insight , " but also to impress upon the entire globe the faint modulations of the human voice , far more still , to transmit power , in unlimited amounts , to any terrestrial distance and almost without any loss. " // <> <> Financed by J. P. Morgan // With the financial backing of J. P. Morgan , Tesla embarked upon a plan to commercialize the discovery , building a 200-foot tower at Shoreham on Long Island . By 1905 , however , Morgan had abandoned the project and the tower was never completed. // Tesla , especially in later years , was a man of extraordinary idiosyncrasies and boastful declarations that sometimes sent his science peers into a rage . His ideas for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasy. // With a pocket-size vibrator , he once told reporters , he could generate resonant tremors that would split the earth in two . He gave its resonant frequency as one hour and 49 minutes . Whatever the plausibility of his earth- splitting scheme , the rather precise estimate of the earth ' s frequency turned out to be close to the mark , as was demonstrated during the great Chilean earthquake of 1960 , when geophysicists were able to measure the time it took waves to travel back and forth through the Earth. // At the symposium some of Tesla ' s advocates seemed to try to outdo the master ' s knack for hyperbole as they conjured visions of death rays and futuristic weapons . In a paper entitled " Star Wars Now ! " Thomas E. Bearden , a retired nuclear engineer and Army war games analyst , noted what he said were a number of designs for making weapons based on Tesla ' s more exotic ideas . The hypothetical devices included what he termed a Tesla howitzer and a Tesla shield that could allegedly stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested in 1940 that the United States military could build a system of death rays that would melt enemy airplanes at a distance of 250 miles . The War Department looked into the idea and said politely , no thanks. // " With Tesla you ' re always going to get the fringe , " said Robert K. Golka , a physicist who spoke at the symposium . " It ' s hard to tell what is real and what is not . Tesla will always attract guys with ideas about perpetual motion. " // Indeed , Tesla himself was something of a character , according to Margaret Cheney , whose book , " Tesla , Man Out of Time , " details some of the eccentricities . At the height of his fame , while eating dinner in the Palm Room of the Waldorf- Astoria Hotel , he would polish the already sparkling sliver and crystal using exactly 18 napkins . He had a phobia about germs and a love of numbers divisible by three. // The New York Times reported in a front-page article in 1915 that Tesla was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Edison . But he never got the award . One biographer said that Tesla had refused to share it with his old rival . Another version has it that Tesla rejected the prize because it had been given in 1909 to Marconi. // After the death of his mother , Tesla became increasingly eccentric and withdrawn . He vigorously disagreed with theories put forward by great scientists of his day including James Clerk Maxwell and Albert Einstein . He never married . Nearly every day he would go to Bryant Park behind the New York Public Library and feed his friends , the pigeons . Late in life he announced that he had received signals from distant planets , a claim that was greeted with some skepticism. // Waldemar B. Kaempffert , a science editor of The New York Times in the first half of the century , once described Tesla as " an intellectual boa constrictor " and a " medieval practitioner of black arts. " // <> <> Attracts Following of Fanatics // Tesla ' s closest living relative , Mr. Terbo , says that four basic types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yugoslavs proud of his achievements , pseudoscientists who pursue some of his wackier ideas and cultists who worship him as an extraterrestrial. // " There are religious fanatics in Pasadena who say he came down on a space ship from Venus , " said Dr. Terbo , adding , " It ' s no small group. " // Although Tesla is only belatedly being recognized for the wide-ranging brilliance of his achievements , one testimonial to his genius did come in 1917 from B. A. Behrend , an engineer who had an inkling of the mark Tesla would make on Western civilization. // " Were we to eliminate from our industrial world the results of his work , " he told a banquet in Tesla ' s honor , " the wheels of industry would cease to turn , our electric cars and trains would stop , our towns would be dark , our mills would be dead and idle . His name marks an epoch in the advance of electrical science . From his work has sprung a revolution. " //          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
