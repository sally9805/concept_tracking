The artistry of War and Peace and Anna Karenina translates into many languages , but Leo Tolstoy the social phenomenon is strictly Russian . Most biographers take this fact for granted . A.N . Wilson spells it out in his descriptions of that vast , isolated kingdom of the 19th century in which the roles of writer and prophet were frequently indistinguishable . Martine de Courcel strikes a deeper Slavic chord when she says that Tolstoy 's aim was to become a Fool of God . Count Leo was , of course , no fool , although many of his truths never got off the ground . His moralizing often seems as windy and endless as the steppes . Had he expounded his ideas about the utility of art earlier in his life , he might never have written his masterpieces of fiction . <P> To modern American readers , Tolstoy 's life sometimes reads like a 19th century version of Portnoy 's Complaint , in which the protagonist never stops griping that his desires are repugnant to his morals .

She relies heavily on the diaries of Tolstoy and his wife Sophia Andreyevna , memoirs , letters and interpretive readings of the novels and essays . These materials are tailored to fit what appears to have been a predetermined conclusion : Tolstoy reconciled his warring selves only when , ten days before dying in 1910 , he fled farm and family . <P> Wilson , one of Britain 's most accomplished comic novelists , is more relaxed about Tolstoy 's contradictions and racked conscience . His imaginative approach to the mysteries of personality is a good reminder that consistency is for peanut butter , not for geniuses who exploit their conflicts in creative acts . Wilson 's Tolstoy is the story of the literary titan 's relationships with three subjects : God , Russia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a homegrown faith that amounted to a churchless Christianity . He shunned organized religion and city life for rustic self-sufficiency among the muzhiks ( peasants ) at his estate , Yasnaya Polyana ( Bright Glade ) . He preached against the evils of meat , alcohol , tobacco and fornication . He believed a Christian should make his own shoes and empty his own chamber pot .
