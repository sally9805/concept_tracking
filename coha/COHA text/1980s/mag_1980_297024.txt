In the course of a long presidential election campaign a chosen few journalists enjoy the opportunity of watching candidates go through their dawn-to-dusk schedules from a claustrophobic range . Last week in Waco , Texas , TIME Photographer Arthur Grace was reminded that the candidates get a good chance to watch journalists too . As he posed for the accompanying picture with Jimmy Carter and Correspondent Christopher Ogden , Grace was surprised to hear the President call him his " secret adviser . " Added Carter : " Whenever I speak , I look to you to see if you 're going to give me the thumbs up or down . " <P> For Ogden , the remark was further evidence of what he sees as a dramatic difference between Carter the President and Carter the campaigner . <P> Ogden has covered more than 80,000 miles in 27 states with the candidate since January . He observes : " The same fellow who can be very cool and distant in Washington takes on almost a new persona on the campaign trail . He can get very excited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ogden says that his stint with Carter has been " a great deal more intense . When he does campaign , Carter throws everything into it . " <P> The pace has been as hectic on the Reagan side , where Correspondent Laurence Barrett says he has seen America as he had not for years : " Mostly it looks like the inside of a plane or a Holiday Inn room . " Barrett covered 80,000 miles and 23 states before he stopped counting three months ago . He has seen two of his portable computer terminals , for filing stories back to New York , go up in smoke . But Barrett remains stoic . Says he : " Come Nov. 4,1 have a fifty-fifty chance of knowing the President-elect better than most people know their next-door neighbors . " <P> Correspondent Eileen Shields has found that a lively sense of humor is essential to survive a presidential campaign . Shields , who has traveled 30,000 miles with Independent Candidate John Anderson since mid-August , describes the atmosphere on Anderson 's press plane as " zanier all the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rubber chicken from the ceiling and blowing whistles during take-offs and landings . Still , admits Shields , " the only thing worse than covering a presidential campaign is not covering one . "
