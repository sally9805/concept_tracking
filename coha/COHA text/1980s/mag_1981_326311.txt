Should Ronald Reagan , once he recovers , change his style and mingle less with the public to minimize the risk of possible future attempts on his life ? Certainly not , says a man who should know : former President Gerald Ford . Within a span of only 17 days in 1975 , two women , Lynette ( " Squeaky " ) Fromme and Sara Jane Moore , tried to shoot Ford in California . Last week he shared his thoughts on the dangers of the presidency with TIME West Coast Bureau Chief Ben Cate . After the two incidents in 1975 , said Ford , " I did n't change my style , and I do n't think any President should . " To do so , he said , would be to " capitulate to the wrong forces in the country . " <P> The ever-present threat of assassination is " part of the job-the peril of the profession , if you will , " said Ford . " There 's no way you can get 100% security unless you sit in the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job entails certain responsibilities . One of those responsibilities is moving around seeing people and appearing in public . <P> If you 're in the job , you have to accept that gamble . "
