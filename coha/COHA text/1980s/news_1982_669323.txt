Then man came <> To the deeper rituals of his bones , <> To the lights lighter than any bones . . . <> Carl Sandburg ; The People , Yes <> // Sometimes , and not always for lack of something better to do , I ask myself : What will have become of man and the earth in , say , 500 trillion years . ( That is a long time . ) Certainly something will be around then . What will it be ? What will we have learned ? What will we be thinking and talking about then ? Inflation ? Wars ? Will we be arguing about which is the real king of beers ? Will soap operas still be popular ? How thick will the plot and the gossip of ' ' As the World Turns ' ' become , after terra firma has turned for another 500 trillion ? // From a perspective of 5x10 to-the-fourteenth-power years hence , from a thought of a power capable of sustaining life that long , some things can begin to seem fairly petty. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience screaming ) , ' ' Do you mean to be so irresponsible as to suggest that the news of the world today and the news of the neighborhood be casually ignored with a ' This too shall pass ' sort of shrug ? Isn ' t this Escapism Sublime ? ' ' Not necessarily . Perhaps what we may need to get us unhung from so many of our hangups is a sense of creation big enough to allow us to put away some of our childish things , war and hate included. // From a larger perspective , I think , we can see ourselves not as this nation or that race , but as the family of man - involved in a momentous process , a stumbling but ongoing search for something more vital , something that feels truer than what we know now . Slowly , in great shuddering , beleaguered steps we are looking for guidance , seeking a higher ground . Is this not true ? Is there not an immense perspective to seek ? The oftentimes agonizing news is not the whole story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found our ' ' final condition . ' ' We may go through great pains ; but we grow . Seeds sprout . Buds bloom . Caterpillars fly . Metamorphosis happens. // One of the more exciting metamorphoses happening right now - in this moment of our 500 trillion years - is the questioning of Newtonian physics as a final statement of the laws governing this universe . With the advent of Einstein and quantum physics , the view of the universe as governed by a fixed , rigid set of laws has been losing ground . Pardon the cliche , but things are ' ' relative . ' ' Reality , or truth , is less determined now by laws of physics ' ' out there . ' ' According to Einstein , we are not mere bystanders in this world . Instead , this world is very much tied to our consciousness of it : things are not objective , they are subjective - subject to our perspective . As poets , mystics , saints , and thinkers have been telling us for centuries , our real world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at from only one two-dimensional perspective . If things are truly relative , what we see ' ' out there ' ' may have something to do with the way we are seeing it . The implications I find behind quantum physics are that the kingdom of heaven is to be found within us. // The shift from an objective sense of experience to a subjective one does not make us little gods - rather , it gives us the opportunity to question the old ones . And one of the most pernicious of the old gods is the Newtonian law that for every action there must be an equal and opposite reaction . This is physics that declares the world is balanced , but this balance is inert , mindless - a balance of bodies at rest . So if this physics is correct , we would be living in a world where the governing laws tried to keep things in a kind of cosmic status quo - the physics of action and reaction would deny any sustained momentum . It would oppose the life force. // In human terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false belief systems and superstitions . It is , in a sense , the Old Testament notion of ' ' an eye for an eye ' ' - a reaction for an action . Taken into our thinking processes , this law would rule by instigating a tyrannical balance , that age-old myth that for every joy there must be a sorrow ; for every grain of order , a grain of chaos ; for every good , a bad. // Because Newton ' s physics is only valid in a closed system ( as a final statement about the world ) , a move to a new order must be considered impossible under his laws . Because change is impossible . Here , metamorphosis doesn ' t happen. // Nowhere , I think , is the resistance to change more evident than in the general thought about who we are and what we are able to do . For example , at the World Future Society ' s recent conference in Washington , a man stood up at the end of a panel discussion entitled ' ' Communication and Religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ecumenicals from the nation ' s mainline Protestant faiths - what they thought about personal transformation . The question was a timely one . Growing numbers of people these days are finding the pursuit of more transcendent ideals and values more fulfilling than the pursuit of better material standards and comfort . And in this seeking , many people have felt themselves ' ' wake up ' ' to a larger sense of themselves , their capacities , and their responsibility to the rest of the human race . They have found themselves , in a degree , transformed - less selfish and more caring than they used to be. // The question was taken by a man from a West Coast school of religion . Wagging his finger at us , he fairly shouted , ' ' I think this whole idea of personal transformation is poppycock . It doesn ' t take into account human nature and the amount of evil in this world . As the Scriptures say , ' The good that I would I do not : but the evil which I would not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think many of us felt pretty bad - mostly about ourselves . But what broke the feeling for me was a sudden recognition of his Bible quote . Not what it said , but who had said it . The Apostle Paul had said it . And Paul was a man who went through the most classic case of transformation in history ! At that point , for me , all the poppycock boomeranged . The panelist was giving us a kind of limited , status quo , ' ' Newtonian theology ' ' that didn ' t allow for change , and which was self-defeating. // One thing is certain , faced with the crises and opportunities of 1982 , some form of metamorphosis needs to happen . Some larger perspective needs to be gained . Looking ahead 500 trillion years broadens things , but to make it that far we need to begin with our own lives today . Transformation for the better won ' t come blindly. // The most powerful transformer I have found is the same book Newton himself studied ceaselessly during the last two-thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a much maligned , often misunderstood book called the Bible . Because it has been so badly interpreted , used , and misrepresented over the years , many people just write it off . Yet look at what the last half teaches : meekness , mercifulness , purity , openness , peacemaking , courage , integrity , patience . These are not philosophical abstractions , and there is nothing theoretical about them . Instead , they are practical and fundamental because they focus on , and come to grips with the unredeemed , untransformed human self within us . The deeper nature of these qualities could take longer than a lifetime to realize . If we are to make any quantum leaps past war and hatred , this is where we need to begin . Then we will still be here in 500 trillion years. // Even longer , no doubt. // //
