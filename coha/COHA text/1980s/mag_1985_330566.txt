Take a dentist 's drill , a meat grinder . . . Take lights and deform them as brutally as you can . Make locomotives crash into one another . . . Explode steam boilers to make railroad mist . Take petticoats and the like , shoes and false hair , also ice skates . <P> So runs one part of a scenario for total theater , as imagined soon after the infinitely worse chaos of the First World War by a German collagist , poet and would-be dramaturge , Kurt Schwitters ( 1887-1948 ) . The scenario casts a long shadow . Schwitters ' ambition to assault all the senses with a megalomaniac collage of real things onstage is the middle term between Wagner and the plotless , junk-crammed happenings that were the talk of the New York art world in the early ' 60s . The more one sees of Schwitters , the more Robert Rauschenberg 's and Jasper Johns ' work in the ' 50s seems to owe to him : the stuffed goat , the paint-soaked bed , the light bulb , the pathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> In Europe , however , Schwitters was virtually the last great modern artist to be widely misunderstood and rejected . Uprooted from his native Germany by Nazism , he found himself cast adrift at 49 , a hard age at which to begin life in exile . He went to Norway , and then in the early ' 40s passed through a series of British internment camps . The artworks and documents he left behind in Hanover were destroyed in an air raid . He suffered from epilepsy and strokes . His wife died of cancer . To support himself he had to do tourist views and kitsch portraits in the Lake District village where , at 60 , he died . But he never stopped working , and what a friend called the distinctive " Schwitters aroma "  --  an amalgam of glue , flour paste and guinea pigs , the portable pets of his exile  --  followed him to the end of his days . <P> The retrospective that New York City 's Museum of Modern Art has dedicated to his work this summer ( through Oct. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schwitters ' larger ambitions . The projects that vented them either were not begun or were destroyed , like the house in Hanover that he transformed into an immense continuous construction , the Merzbau . The show 's catalog , written by its curator , John Elderfield of MOMA , far surpasses in lucidity and thoroughness anything else on Schwitters and becomes the authoritative work on the artist . It evokes in brilliant detail the aggressive and sadistic side of Schwitters ' lost oeuvre , which was grandiose and trashy but done with constructivist precision . One of his avant-garde friends , on first viewing the Merzbau 's bizarre grottoes and columns ( which included such elegancies as a " Sex-Crime Cavern " and a bottle of the artist 's urine with artificial flowers in it ) , thought it " a kind of fecal smearing  --  a sick and sickening relapse . " Would it look so violent today ? Perhaps not , but certainly the Schwitters placed before us on the walls of MOMA is a different creature , edited by the survival of small works and the destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
