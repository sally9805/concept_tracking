Those security guards who were on duty looked bored and lonesome ; the empty seats inside resembled rows of plastic soldiers ; peanuts and Crackerjacks remained in their containers ; souvenir stands were bolted shut . Above that spot in the Angels ' dugout where first baseman Rod Carew generally sits , I discovered a single stick of gum , still in its wrapper. // At field level an aerating machine was punching holes in the grass , occupying the time of two groundskeepers . High above in the front office , members of the publicity staff were constantly answering telephones . The callers were always the same  --  fans either wanting to know when the strike would end or offering some speedy solution. // Nobody wins a strike , the saying goes , and that certainly seems true in this case. // With the average major league salary at $163 , 000 for a 162-game season , the loss averages out to a little more than $1 , 000 a game per player during the strike , plus meal money of $37. 50 a day while on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Dave Parker of the Pittsburgh Pirates , Dave Winfield of the New York Yankees , and Nolan Ryan of the Houston Astros will forfeit approximately $6 , 172. 84 for every game that is canceled. // The clubs are protected for a while via strike insurance plus a special fund they ' ve built up for this eventuality , but in time they too would begin to feel the inch. // The big losers , though , are the fans , many fo whom couldn ' t care les about salaries and compensation but who don ' t like the idea of their " national pastime " being disrupted. // Larry Larsen , a California real estate dealer who had planned to attend 25 big league games this year and has already seen five , told me : // " I don ' t really understand the free agent issue and I wonder if all of the players do either . With owners and players earning so much money today I can ' t understand why they can ' t come to some agreement . Baseball , like a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn ' t available , people are going to look elsewhere for their entertainment , and maybe they won ' t come back. " // Some fans even plan their vacations around the home team ' s schedule , and for them , of course , there is no turning back . Also , most clubs don ' t plan to do anything about refunds , including advance ticket sales and season ticket sales , until the end of the strike . This means that the owners will continue to draw interest off what is basically the fans ' money. // Speculation as to when this strike will end was everywhere . However , in Washington D.C. , Edward Bennett Williams , famed trial lawyer and chairman of the board of the Baltimore Orioles , said he thought president Reagan should intervene and stop the strke . But the general consensus seemed to be that if an agreement wasn ' t reached by the end of the week , this disagreement probably would last at least until Aug. 7. // Said Boston Red Sox outfielder Dwight Evans : " The owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us by the courts , and we ' re not going to do that . One of the reasons salaries are so high is because owners Gene Autry of the California Angels , George Steinbrenner of the New York Yankees , and Ted Turner of the Altanta Braves keep giving players thousands of dollars more than they are worth . Well , that ' s not our fault . I see a long strike because the players are united and stubborn , and because the owners are stupid. * They ' re crazy not to let us keep what we already have. " // Anticipating the possiblility of a strike and unwilling to budge on the issue of free agent compensation , the owners at the start of the 1980 season began assessing themselves 2 percent of their gate receipts . It is estimated that they now have a war chest of $15 million. // In addition the owners also purchased $50 million in strike insurance at a cost of $2 million to themselves , but which does not take effect until 153 games of the league ' s regular schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it would take all 26 major league clubs to play approximately 153 games ) the owners will rely on the $15 million to cover their expenses. // After that , according to reports , the $50 million in outside insurance would become effective , with $100 , 000 per scheduled league game being divided equally among the nonplaying ball clubs . The strike insurance probably would run out about Aug. 7. // " since player payrolls and expenses account of about 60 percent of a team ' s operating budget , " one team ' s traveling secretary told me , " I feel pretty sure that the owners might actually make money between now and Aug. 7 . I understand the umpires signed an agreement last year that continues their salaries through any strike . While most clubs have already laid off between 1 , 00 and 2 , 000 part-time workers ( like ushers , security men , parking lot attendants , concessionaires ) I ' m sure that regular employees have nothing to fear. " // Placing the blame for this strike exactly where it belongs is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners make huge profits from ticket sales , TV and radio revenue , concession and souvenir sales , what other business do you know where the average salary of 600-plus employees is $163 , 000 for six months. // Most professional athletes , and particularly baseball players , do not live in the real world . They have agents to handle their financial dealings ; clubhouse personnel to clean their uniforms , shine their shoes , and order their bats ; and traveling secretaries to arrange air and ground transportation , book hotel reservations , and provide them with meal money. // Said one former player who is now a big league pitching coach : " Most ball players are like little kids . I know , because I was like that myself when I was a player . If this strike goes beyond three days , most of them won ' t know what to do with themselves . They ' ll be fighting with their wives , upset with their kids , and bored to death . How many days in a row can you play golf  --  especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here where his Boston team had been scheduled to play over the weekend , Red Sox elder statesman Carl Yastrzemski told me : " I don ' t want to strike and i know a lot of players in baseball who feel the same way . Since free agent compensation is the only issue that has to be settled , I can ' t understand how two groups of men can ' t come to a decision . If a compromise is the only way that they can work things out , then that ' s what they ought to do. " // asked from a physical standpoint what players would have the most trouble staying sharp during a prolonged strike , former Yankee manger Bob Lemon ( now a baseball scout ) replied : // " Well , a pitcher , if he can find an experienced catcher to work with , can throw every day on the sidelines and at least keep his rhythm . But players who have to get friends to throw batting practice for them or hit against a pitching machine , aren ' t going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike ends I think you ' ll find the pitchers holding a big edge over the hitters of a while. " // The funniest line of the disagreement probably came from Johnny Carson when he said that although the Chicago Cubs game was canceled , the team " scored its usual number of runs ! " // //
