There is never a good time for a jet fighter to crash , but the loss of an F-20 Tigershark jet in Labrador last week seemed particularly inopportune . The plane , en route to the Paris Air Show , had stopped over at Goose Bay airport ; coming in from a practice flight , it suddenly nosed down during its landing approach , killing Pilot David Barnes , 40 , as it plowed into the ground . The crash occurred the day before the annual stockholders meeting of Northrop Corp. , which spent $800 million to develop the F-20 but has not been able to sell a single plane . The accident may also undermine efforts in Congress to force the Pentagon to acquire 300 Tigersharks for the Coast Guard and Air Force reserve squadrons . That would cover Northrop 's development costs and perhaps convince other countries that they should buy the plane . <P> Northrop has been promoting the F-20 as a less expensive and more reliable alternative to General Dynamics ' widely used F-16 . The Tigershark 's reputation had already suffered from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accident on pilot error . Last week 's disaster left Northrop with only one prototype . Still , Chairman Thomas V. Jones vowed to renew his efforts to sell the aircraft .
