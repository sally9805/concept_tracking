The spate of recent discoveries includes additional natural gas off Sable Island on the Scotia Shelf , more crude oil off Newfoundland , and still more oil and gas under the ice-covered waters of the far northern archipelago. // In addition , a record-breaking exploratory effort is in the making this year in all the promising exploration " hot spots , " including the waters off Labrador and , when polar conditions permit , the Beaufort Sea near Alaska. // Canada ' s offshore exploration expenditures will soar to more than $600 million ( Can. ) for the first time . Indeed , industry spending within two years could reach $1 billion annually as work to develop newly discovered fields begins in certain areas. // Canada ' s offshore regions provide some cheer for an otherwise largely demoralized petroleum industry , doing little more than tenaciously holding its own in the face of what it considers harsh political and economic adversities. // " The news is good from afar , " a senior local executive said , reflecting the mixed emotions now experienced by many oil people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospects nearer t o home. " // Mobil , in partnership with the state corporation Petro- Canada and private interests including Gulf Canada , texaco , Columbia Gas Developments Canada Ltd. , and Chevron Standard , dominates the Scotia Shelf-Grand Banks location. // Shell Canada , BP Canada , and Aquitaine Canada are expected to be back off the Labrador coast , along with Esso- Imperial , adding to the acute shortage of drilling vessels worldwide. // Dome Petroleum , in tandem with its corporate " clone , " Dome Canada  --  created to meet new stringent tenancy rules of federally administered lands and waters  --  will be the leading operator in the Beaufort . Esso-Imperial , gulf , and Shell Canada are expected to resume work in the adjacent Mackenzie River Delta. // Meanwhile , Panarctic Oils Ltd. , the consortium of Petro- Canada ( 45 percent ) and 30 private interests , will be going after its own tantalizing prospects on the top of the world with " renewed vengeance , " Charles Hetherington , its president , says. // It is possible that given the financial grants recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs , more companies , both returnees and rank novices , might be joining the northern throng . In future , only Canadian-controlled companies need to bother with prospects north of the 60th parallel because they alone will qualify for the incentives. // Foreign-dominated companies already in the federal regions will have to " go Canadian " or take on Canadian partners to qualify for development and production permits. // Anything less than 50 percent Canadian content won ' t get you more than an exploration permit . At least 75 percent will be needed to secure the right to turn on the taps. // Petro-Canada will have an automatic " back in " provision into all discoveries so far made , now in the making , or yet to be made , to the tune of 25 percent , without having the contribute to expenditures . In other words , it will get 25 percent of the equity of companies working in the " frontier " areas. // Despite what industry experts have already considered " onerous " circumstances , the frontiers in general and the offshore areas in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , simply have to make do , since they can hardly be expected to abandon their sizable investments altogether. // Mobil Canada has reported possibly commercial gas volumes off Sable Island in a well dug to appraise the 1979 " venture D-23 " discovery well. // Both Mobil and Petro-Canada speak in positive terms about Sable Island gas prospects . They talk of initial deliveries of gas to shore perhaps as early as 1985. // The strategy used there will be dictating the reevaluation of earlier " teaser wells " and even dry holes . That ' s because experts now believe that wells drilled in the past have not gone deep enough to reach the gaspressured and geologically complex area. // By comparison , Newfoundland offshore operations are fast becoming fairly routine to mount , despite the exceptional pressures and the high cost of wells there. // The average east coast probe costs about $25 million . But some problem-ridden wells are knows to have run to almost twice as much. // Mobil Canada ' s Hebron find last month glowed almost as brightly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1979 , with logs registering a net pay thickness of at least 150 feet . Still more tests are needed to evaluate fully Hebron , sunk into a separate structure 23 miles southeast of Hibernia. // There have been several tantalizing finds farther north off the Labrador coast . But to date no commercial find has materialized. // Jack Gallagher , chairman of Dome , said his company ' s Kopanoar well north of mainland Canada will be " drained " from two atoll-like production platforms with dozens of wells each and a year-round loading facility. // The tentative date of Beaufort Sea production is mid1985 . Each of the two Kopanoar pools , Mr. Gallagher says , could contain up to 1 billion barrels of recoverable oil. // He says the Beaufort Sea contains , literally , dozens of similar and even larger structures , several of which have the potential to eclipse even Prudhoe Bay offshore of Alaska. // All the dozen Dome wells that this company drilled in the past five years  --  the annual drilling season is only about four months  --  have had some hydrocarbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1981 offshore expenditures are estimated at about $200 million in the Beaufort ; $55 million to $75 million in the high Arctic , depending on whether Panarctic can find a fourth rig ; about $150 million for Labrador ' s share ; and around $250 million for the Newfoundland waters and the Scotia Shelf together. // That total  --  about $675 million ( Can. )  --  compares with about $500 million spent on the same prospective areas in the past year. // //
