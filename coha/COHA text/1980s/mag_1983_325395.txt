Joseph Mitchell , a North Carolinian , once wrote a story called Hit on the Head with a Cow . The story was not so much about being hit on the head with a cow-although he had as a boy been felled by a beef that slipped its hoist as he prepared to skin it-but rather it was about the disoriented , pleasantly confused sensation that a knockdown blow begets , the same sort of crackbrained feeling that certain cranks , eccentrics , free spirits , if you will , can induce in any listener who truly tries to follow . Listening to Bob Windsor , another North Carolinian , has a lot in common with being hit on the head with a cow . <P> Windsor is a very large man who publishes a newspaper in Chapel Hill with the assistance of a dwarf , whom Windsor calls his bodyguard . The newspaper is called the Landmark , and it is published higgledy-piggledy . Sometimes it is a weekly , and sometimes it is a biweekly , and sometimes it is just , well , tardy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press run is 4,600 , as it was for the first issue last June 10 , or 20,000 , as it was for the most recent issue , there are precious few copies , if any , left over at the office , a casebook study in clutter , standing between a liquor store and a massage parlor . <P> It is a populist paper , written mostly in the first person , entirely without pretension and utterly without objectivity , by Windsor , who is something of a card . Windsor wears red Camel overalls and chain-chews Tums in between smoking Pall Malls , and the effect of his great heft is stunning : he looks like a denim- wrapped redwood that somebody potted in brogans . What is more , he has a tongue that could not be stilled if you placed it under a brick . " I always wanted me a paper , " he was saying the other day , discarding a half-formed opinion that contemporary chickens have no personalities . " I looked into buying one , but they all wanted a fortune . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought paste-up was something you did with wallpaper and layout was something you did with a girl . " <P> He was 53 then and feeling solvent . He had been rich two or three times since he took a bachelor 's degree in history from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1954 , going on to speculate prosperously in land . He speaks wistfully of a period , long ago , when he ran through his money in the sporting houses of Havana . Laying a finger alongside a nose whose veins suggest some past abuse , he allows : " One time , I drank myself broke . " <P> Sober again ( and sober still ) , he made more money , but , as his wife Joyce observes , " Bob and money do n't get along . One time we had a Cadillac and an airplane , but I did n't have a cup that matched a saucer . "
