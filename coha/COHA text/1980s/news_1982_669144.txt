Unfortunately , few investors did when the Mexico Fund , a closed-end mututal fund was launched in June l98l by three brokerage firms , Merrill Lynch , Salomon Brothers , and Bache , in conjunction with Mexican securities firms. // At the time , the allure of the nouveau riche oil capital , with an annual gross national product ( GNP ) growth of 8 percent , was such that Americans clamored for the chance to get into the opportunities the Mexico Fund offered on the Bolsa de Valores - the Mexico City Stock Exchange . In fact demand was so great that the underwriters managed to sell $120 million worth of shares in the fund - some $48 million more than they had originally planned on. // The price per share was $12 . And , as a closed-end fund , the sponsors offer neither to buy back shares or sell more . Once the offering is complete the fund is offered on the New York Stock Exchange and shares trade up and down with demand. // After just a bit more than a year , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2 1/4 per share . And in early September , trading was halted at the request of the fund ' s sponsors. // According to David Bodenberg , vice-president for international research at Merrill Lynch , one of the Mexico Fund ' s underwriters , the Fund ' s trading was halted for two equally cogent reasons . First of all , trading had been halted on the Bolsa , which made the Fund ' s sponsors unable to evaluate the net asset value of the Fund and make any recommendations . Further , since one of the measures the Mexican Government had taken to counteract the panic run on the peso was to nationalize the country ' s private banks , and the Mexico Fund had 7. 6 percent of its asset value in bank stock as of last May , there was no way the fund could establish what value , if any , they could attribute to their bank stocks. // Beyond the immediate problem lay the currency dilemma . Explains Mr. Bodenberg , ' ' The last net asset value before the Bolsa closed down and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was estimated at 108 pesos per dollar . A few days before that , net value had been estimated at roughly $2. 80 - $2. 90 . That had been under the first phase of exchange controls when Mexico had switched to a two-tier currency market. ' ' // Currency is an important factor in the Mexico Fund , since all stocks the Fund invests in trade in pesos . Those peso values have to be converted into dollars when the stock is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange . But as the Mexican Government switched the official conversion rates several times , and forced some peso conversion onto the illegal black market , the Mexico Fund found its share price in US dollars on the Big Boardswitched from a 50 percent premium over the estimated net asset value in pesos to a 30 percent discount at the blink of an eye . Such enormous fluctuations result in uncertainty , to put it mildly . And uncertainty is the chief antagonist of investment. // But even before the apparently temporary closing of the Bolsa , the Mexico Fund appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $27/8 bid , $31/8 asked , reflecting the break in world oil prices , the free-fall of the Mexican peso after two massive devaluations , and the disintegration of Mexico ' s financial credibility throughout the world as it nearly defaulted on $80 billion in bank loans . In short , the dream built on Mexican oil was fading away. // Imitation , they say , is the sincerest form of flattery . And Wall Street , like most of us , prefers to remember its successes rather than its failures . So when the glimmer of an idea about the Mexico Fund hit , Wall Street glowed with the memory of the Japan Fund and forgot the Brazil Fund. // The Japan Fund , a prosperous mutual fund launched in the 1960s , enabled investors to multiply their asset value twelvefold within 18 years by hitching their wagons to the star of the unrelenting industrialization of Japan. // But investors would probably have been more savvy had they remembered the fate of the Brazil Fund and used that other single-market investment fund as a role model. // Issued in 1973 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brazil Fund aimed at taking advantage of Brazil ' s ' ' economic miracle ' ' in which the Latin American country was posting impressive 8 percent growth in GNP year in and year out . The problem , however , according to Geoffrey Collier , president of the New York office of Vickers Da Costa , was that the Brazil Fund backfired in 1974 when oil prices quadrupled and oil-poor Brazil became mired in debt and runaway inflation. // ' ' It took a lot longer for the Brazil Fund to fall than for the Mexico Fund , ' ' muses Collier about the precipitous plunge in Mexico . The Brazilian stock market index rose from 60 to 450 . But because of currency translation problems , the Brazil Fund shares , issued at $10 , dropped to less than $6 . It has since recovered slightly. // The Mexican Bolsa , on the other hand , has been a disappointment since the Mexico Fund began . When the fund was first issued the Bolsa index stood at about 1 , 000 , down somewhat from its all-time high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issuance of the fund the index has fallen steadily , until before Mexico ' s most recent devaluation , the Bolsa index hit a low of 480 . And when the Bolsa closed on Sept. 1 , it was at about 570 . Its average price-to-earnings ratio for the entire Bolsa was two times earnings. // While rumors about the reopening of the Bolsa circulate daily , the consequences of the Government ' s actions on the Mexican stock market remain an enigma . Some believe the Bolsa was closed to allow the Mexican Government to decide on compensation for the assets the Government nationalized. // Rumors about possible settlements are flying , meanwhile , and will probably grow more panicky the longer the Bolsa is closed . Some believe the Government is extending the period until it finds a just compensation package , as was the case in France . But a less innocent interpretation suggests that the new Government of Mexico ' s central bank is more adamantly socialist and would prefer dumping shareholdings at whatever price can be gotten - no matter how low . And that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the Mexico Fund , the longer the Bolsa stays closed , the worse things look. // Even if the Government takes the best posture and bails out private investors , things will not be simple . Currency complications are bound to harm the funds . The Mexico Fund is scheduled to pay a dividend in early 1983 . The Fund set aside dollar deposits in Mexican institutions to pay that dividend . But government rules indicate all such deposits must be turned into pesos , and only removed with specific government permission. // Unfortunately for the Fund ' s sponsors , such crises do not discriminate between good investors and bad ones . ' ' The Fund has outperformed the market , ' ' says Mr. Bodenberg . But he admits that in such situations , stock picking is secondary to the market . ' ' Basically , ' ' he says , ' ' individual stocks are not the game to play . The question is whether to buy Mexico or not to buy Mexico. ' ' // And the answer ? Mr. Bodenberg answers , ' ' this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buys Mexico and then goes to sleep for a year , he will wake up a lot richer . But for someone who doesn ' t sleep quite so well , Mexico during the next few months will endure some problems that could keep him awake many nights. ' ' // //
