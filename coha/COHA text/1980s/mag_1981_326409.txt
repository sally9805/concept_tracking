As the Pope recovers , his assailant remains a mystery <P> His first normal meal consisted of consomm and a boiled , mashed pear , and the next day he tackled a bowl of stracciatella , a hot chicken broth with egg drops . There were clear signs last week that Pope John Paul II was on his way to recovery-and , as usual with any job he tackled , doing it robustly . Doctors at Rome 's Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic removed the 26 stitches they had inserted after a would-be assassin 's bullet ripped through the Pope 's abdomen on May 13 . The Pontiff received visitors , made brief voyages to a nearby armchair and walked in the corridor outside the tenth-floor four-room suite , where he had been moved from the hospital 's intensive-care unit . <P> Typically , John Paul was thinking of others . He ordered flowers sent to the two American tourists , Rose Hall and Ann Odre , who had been shot with him in that appalling moment in St. Peter 's Square . When a group of 52 schoolchildren gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers for his speedy recovery , the Pope sent a messenger bustling down with a fond reply : " I bless you , and I would like to kiss you all , one by one . " John Paul even celebrated a birthday ; he was an increasingly hearty , if not yet hale , 61 . <P> Doctors warned that the accelerated pace of the Pope 's recovery did not mean the end of his ordeal . John Paul faces a second major operation in approximately a month to reconnect his large intestine , which was surgically isolated to help cut the risk of infection . But a team of six doctors from five countries ( two from the U.S. , one each from France , Poland , Spain and West Germany ) pronounced him to be recovering nicely so far . Early last week the Pope was moved to say , after sipping tea laced with sugar , " Per la prima volta , mi sento bene " ( For the first time , I feel well ) . <P> Though the Pope was impaired , business at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as discreetly as possible . John Paul met six times with Agostino Cardinal Casaroli , the Vatican Secretary of State , and was told of the defeat of a referendum proposal backed by the Pope that would have restricted abortions . He also received a surprise visit from Franciszek Cardinal Macharski , the Archbishop of Cracow and an old personal friend , who brought " the greetings of the people of Poland . " <P> Meanwhile , about 3 miles away , Italian police were still trying to make sense out of the bizarre maunderings of Mehmet Ali Agca , the gaunt and hollow-eyed Turkish gunman who felled John Paul in what he termed a " protest against the imperialism of the Soviet Union and the United States . " The terrorist told interrogators that he had first wanted to kill the " King of England " as well as the President of the European Parliament . He said he changed his mind after discovering that Britain was ruled by Queen Elizabeth II and the Europarliamentary President was a woman , Simone Veil . Agca told police that " as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman .
