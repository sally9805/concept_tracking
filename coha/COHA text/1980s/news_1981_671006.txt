Since then , the Kroffts have been known for their television work in Hollywood . They have produced Saturday morning shows for children as well as prime-time series starring Donnie and Marie Osmond and Barbara Mandrell .

Her visitor sat on her right side , near her good ear . " So often I ' ve been in a play and thought : ' I don ' t know why people come to see it . It ' s so boring . ' But this one is so enchanting. " // Miss Nesbitt recalled that she almost turned down the role of Mrs. Higgins in 1956 . " It ' s such a little part , " she explained . " I don ' t have much to do . I just pop on and off . But now I ' m at the age where the smaller the part , the better. " // " As one gets older , " she added , " one doesn ' t expect to still be employed . It gives a lift that someone wants you again .

' " ) . // Finally , it was time for her to lie down and rest for the performance that evening . " I ' ve had a wonderful life , " Miss Nesbitt concluded . " I haven ' t been known as a great actress , but I ' ve been a very successful one . And I have children and grandchildren I love . By and large , I ' ve found life very pleasant.
