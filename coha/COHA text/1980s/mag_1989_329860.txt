Fogel enjoys the veneration , up to a point ; his work has garnered moderate recognition and less money . But Simson 's relentless requests for advice , tips on writing and letters of recommendation distract Fogel from his own efforts , in this case his slow progress in finishing another novel : " Perfection comes hard to an imperfectionist . He had visions of himself dying before the book was completed . It was a terrible thought : Fogel seated at the table , staring at his manuscript , pen in hand , the page ending in a blot . " <P> With hindsight this passage seems chilling . An Exorcism was not included among the 25 works in The Stories of Bernard Malamud ( 1983 ) .

When the narrative breaks off , the good guys are losing , a situation that is also typical of its author . But in the notes he left for the remaining four chapters , Malamud outlined a way for Yozip to be of further , and possibly victorious , service to those who had adopted him . <P> The best part of this volume can be found in the 16 stories following the unfinished novel . Five have never been published , and the rest were never collected in hard covers . It is difficult to imagine why not . Malamud hit his stride early , writing stories of old men trying to preserve their dignity amid the shambles of harsh circumstances .
