The nation 's biggest chain combines profits with a Pulitzer <P> To mark his birthday last year , friends roasted Allen Harold Neuharth , 56 , with a bogus interview printed under the logo of the Cocoa ( Fla . ) Today , a newspaper he helped launch in 1966 . " We 're pushing for a Pulitzer this year , " the fictive Neuharth remarks at one point . In what category ? " Profit . Er , make that ' progress . ' " <P> Er , make that " public service . " Last week the Gannett News Service , which provides national reporting for the 82 Gannett-owned dailies , won the prestigious Pulitzer Gold Medal for its investigation of financial improprieties committed by the Pauline Fathers , a small order of monks in eastern Pennsylvania . The award was sweet vindication for Al Neuharth , Gannett 's chairman and president . Best known for making the chain the largest and most consistently profitable in the U.S. , Neuharth has lately been on a tireless campaign to make it one of the most respected as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is gratifying recognition of the pretty professional work that Gannett News Service has been doing for quite a while . " <P> In the 74 years since the late Frank E. Gannett purchased the Elmira ( N.Y. ) Star-Gazette , the chain has steered clear of big-city competition . Instead , Gannett has concentrated on small-and medium-sized towns with only one daily . The stereotypical Gannett paper has a circulation of 40,000 , profit margins that dazzle Wall Street and a reputation for editorial lassitude . Defending his preference for local monopolies , Neuharth once said : " I do n't dislike fighting , I just like winning . " <P> Gannett is beginning to grow its reputation for thinking small . It became a true press giant last summer when it merged with Combined Communications Corp. , a Phoenix-based firm that owned the Cincinnati Enquirer ( current circ. 190,000 ) and Oakland ( Calif . ) Tribune ( current circ. 165,000 ) , seven television stations , twelve radio stations and extensive outdoor-advertising interests . Among chains , Gannett is the longtime leader in number of papers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulation . Gannett 's total is now 3,580,000 ( vs . Knight-Ridder 's 3,492,000 ) , more than double that of a decade ago . <P> Neuharth is perhaps the highest-paid newspaper executive in the country ( $1,160,000 in salary , benefits and stock options last year ) and is currently finishing his second one-year term as president of the American Newspaper Publishers Association . He has used his ANPA position to exhort fellow journalists to defend the beleaguered First Amendment and to hire more women and minorities . These are heartfelt concerns , but Neuharth 's passionate pursuit of them is constantly put to use in his crusade to recast Gannett 's image . The company trumpets its commitment to journalistic freedom and excellence in expensive and seemingly ubiquitous corporate advertisements , and a skillful p.r . staff lets no Gannett achievement go unheralded . The chain has even adopted a new motto : " A World of Different Newspapers " has become " A World of Different Voices Where Freedom Speaks . "                 @ @ @ @
