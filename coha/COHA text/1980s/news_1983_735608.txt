txt " What do you think happened ? " I asked a person prominent in the George Jackson entourage . This had been a big day in the George Jackson business . He was killed in a shootout at San Quentin prison . " What do you think really happened ? " - wen , ueorge was clump enougn to think he could blast his way to freedom and he found someone dumb enough to smuggle in a pistol . But what we 're going to say is he was set up by the pigs . We 're going to say he was murdered . " " But you do n't think that 's what hap-pened ? " " This is politics , man . You got to keep the big picture in mind . " * * * Perhaps , even in that revolutionary hangover period of the early ' 70s , even in the San Francisco Bay area , the smaller pictures should have been kept in mind , too  --  telling the truth , integrity , honesty . Earlier , I had been invited to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quentin - to celebrate publication of George Jackson 's book , his collected letters and thoughts . Champagne and crackers in those cold winds , before those cold walls and bars ; well , why not check it out ? I bundled up as much as one can bundle in blue denims . But along with the flirtations , jokes and thrills of that occasion in the chill winds off San Francisco Bay , an unsettling dogma was preached at the gates of the prison . Fay Stender , a lawyer , stood on a box to make a speech in which she cried out . " Free all political prisoners ! " and it seemed as if every fist shot into the air . I raised my arm , too . I 'll admit . I do n't believe the state should hold political prisoners and I could assent to her slogan . OK , yes , no political prisoners . Then she paused , took a breath , and added a second command : " Free all prisoners ! " Again the fists were thrust up . but this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the arms around me . " Did you hear what she said ? All prisoners ? Do you really want every prisoner re-leased ? " A little knot of angry friends confronted me with the dictum : All crime is political ; and thus I knew I was at the wrong literary cocktail party . There is an element of lust  --  call it enthusiasm , call it commitment , call it love ? in any determined action , and politics is no exception . In Fay Stender , as in other prisoner groupies , it came naked out of the dilemmas of an incomplete person . Although she had a husband and children , she fell in love with the idea of the Stranger ; in this case , black prisoners . Inevitably , they ( or he ) let her down . She fell out of love with " the prisoner movement . " Her next love was a young woman lawyer . Such anxious stylishness is material for satire of the time  --  or , in someone who treasures democratic and liberal-hopes , for pity and rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the George Jacksons and Jack Abbotts . By now Fay Stender might have been a harried seeker , and her credentials as " radical lawyer " would not have protected her from the normal weariness of age and the fickleness of causes . But fate cast her in another role , that of martyr . An intruder broke into her house , babbling that she had betrayed George Jackson . She was shot , paralyzed , her life destroyed , and a few months later killed herself . Perhaps the man who shot her is the product of a faulty politics , a faulty time ; perhaps politics are always faulty , and the times always out of joint . But perhaps he should not have been wandering about with delusions in his heart and revenge in his hand . Those who commit murder . rape , muggings and burglary need to be pitied from a certain distance . We need them to be pitied locked up away from ourselves and our children : away from the dilettantes of revolution , too . New West magazine ran a long article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the elements of abstract politics , racial snobbery , sexual confusion , factional quarrels , inverted idealism , purest timeserving and ideological obfuscation were painfully sorted out by journalists with excellent radical credentials . They were attacked by their former friends as supporters of " McCarthyite trashing " of civil rights and racial justice . A woman supported by her trust funds accused them of being too well-paid by New West ( for anyone who has written for New West  --  now called California  --  this thought provided additional comedy ) . The facts and quotations in the article were not questioned , but the analysis was blamed for being " inopportune " when we must all unite against Reagan , etc. , etc . The verb " to trash " ? that weatherperson-chic disposeall  --  is a ticket of admittance to this salon . In other words , whatever happened . We 're going to sau . . . Because that 's the big picture . A critic of the article by Peter Collier and David Horowitz granted that their " details " are correct , but " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People can get killed , " he said . In other words , first comes an idealistic line  --  protection of a radical position : and then there is a line of prudence  --  the objects of all this idealism might shoot . Somehow one is to yoke the two lines together . The name for such behavior is bureaucratic totalitarianism , fascist or communist , which uses threats of vengeance and torture in the name of the People or the Nation . These are more than mere nuances . The disarray of ' 60s radicalism is not the product of journalistic truth-telling or of a neoconservative mood . With their sentimentality and their fury for ideology , with their carelessness in human relations , the Fay Stenders of that time let us all down . And the sad case of this driven and desperate woman , who suffered horribly in the wake of confusions she helped disseminate , surely suggests a pathetic fable for the times . May she rest in peace . But may those who seek to paint her as a heroine and martyr be content with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a consequence , suffered unbearably .
