That ' s what the shippers of hazardous material ' s are finding . Of course , new government rules and regulations are forcing the transportation business to be more careful in rail , road , and river shipments of hazardous materials  --  some 250 , 000 shipments each day last year . But the industry has also found that safety measures are cheaper than disaster. // Out of these 250 , 000 shipments , about 16 , 000 accidental leakages took place  --  most of them minor . But the recent flurry of serious accidents points up the importance of better safety equipment and standards. // In Waverly , Tenn. , a company shipping by rail was sued for $30 million . An accident there caused extensive damage to the countryside and killed 15 people . Chances are the accident could have been avoided had sufficient safety steps been taken. // The Department of Transpostation ( DOT ) regulates all modes of transport under its Title 49 code list . Most sources feel these are only an introduction to what could be done to prevent accidents. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some have their own safety research , while others simply keep up with federally funded projects which they feel could be beneficial. // Preston Lockridge , an official with the Transportation Test Center of the Federal Railroad Administration ( FRA ) , says the testing center devises improvements for tank cars and tracks which " could curb the number of accidents. " // One is a flame retardant coating which , when painted on tank cars inhibits them from igniting . Sometimes when one car gets punctured , it acts like a torch , shooting flame onto other cars . With the coating , they will resist combustion. // A 1 , 500-foot section of track equipped with devices attuned to potential problematic areas of the train is another testing center safety effort . When the train is run over the track , the devices detect dragging brakes , cracked wheels , adn other sources of derailment. // The information is relayed back to a computer area where the signals are read , and defects can be fixed before the train leaves the area. // Mr. Lockridge says that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he reports that " their attitude is quite positive , " and he expects greater cooperation. // Different types of toxic materials need different precautionary measures and tank cars , says Gloria Stone , a spokeswoman for the Boston &; Maine Railroad . Tank cars are usually owned by the company shipping the chemicals , not the railway , and are built according to safety rules from the FRA and Association of American Railroads. // Boston and Maine has spent $104 million in the past six years on track rehabilitation , and other maintenance. // Regulations for truckers and shippers vary intrastate , but the Federal Highway Administration sets up general interstate guidelines. // States , the highway administration , and various trucking companies combine to evaluate routes and provide transporters with guidelines . Says Russell Toth , hazardous materials liaison officer at the Federal Highway Administration : " Our aim is a good route with minimal exposure to population. " // The Aug. 9 propane leak on the George Washington Bridge in New York City highlights the importance of local regulation . With better attention to routing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been avoided , the experts maintain. // Ralph V. Durham , director of safety and health for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , sees a problem with local regulation : " There will be a mishmash if it ' s left to the states . Drivers won ' t know what routes to take. " // As for safer equipment , the Federal Highway Administration is " doing its best , " says Mr. Toth . " We don ' t want something that will run into a concrete wall at 150 miles per hour , but we do want to make sure that a tank truck is safe by having its manufacturers prove the product will withstand rigorous transport. " // Many tank trucks now come with vapor release valves which prevent excessive pressure within the tank. // Drivers are most vulnerable to accidents . Many companies are establishing training programs on the special needs of hazardous loads , hoping to lessen the chances of injury . " There is a bewildering array of hazardouw materials , " says Stephen McDougall , Teamsters Union industrial hygenicist , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling and how to work with it in an emergency. " // The Coast Guard also has preventative hazardous materials measures . Chief Richard Griggs of the Pollution Responce Branch says regulations touch on chemical control in a number of ways . " No ship is built until we review the company ' s construction plans , " he says . " Once on the water , all ships are inspected frequently at port . " Also , the DOT has compatibility tables for cargo stowage which , for instance , prevent shippers from loading acid over something flammable. // Local port regulations vary according to geographics . In Boston , where the port is fairly narrow , ships carrying liquefied natural gas take priority over other ships entering the harbor . The port practically shuts down while the tanker pulls in . Port Captain Barry Eldridge says a " two miles ahead and one mile stern collision safety zone " is required as these tankers enter and leave the harbor. // Both Captain Eldridge and Chief briggs agree that water transport is the safest way to move hazardous loads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in barges , bulk carriers , and cargo ships in 1979 was 4 , 325 , about 25 percent of the accident total. // Radioactive materials are a particularly sensitive regulating area for all transporters . Lee Metcalfe , a hazardous material specialist for the DOT , says radioactive materials in all modes of transport are will regulated compared with chemicals . A truck can hit a rail car with nuclear materials in it at 60 miles an hour and the car wouldn ' t even bruise. // But the Teamsters Union ' s Stephen McDougall disagrees : " Radioactives may be well regulated on paper , put studies show drivers and shippers are overexposed . The problem is that no one monitors the radioactivity . " Independent truckers are especially vulnerable to illegal exposure since they are more willing to cart dangerous loads in order to keep themselves in business. // //
