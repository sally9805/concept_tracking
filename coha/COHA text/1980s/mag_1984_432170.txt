 | There 's a lot riding on this year 's U.S. national ski team . After all , these are the men and women who are supposed to bring back the gold and silver from Sarajevo in February and , in doing so , make up for all those years when Swedes , Austrians , Liechtensteiners and other blonds kicked snow in America 's face . Led by Phil Mahre and the beautiful Tamara McKinney , this crop of outstanding young athletes is expected to do for U.S. skiing what Napa and Sonoma did for U.S. wine making . But things began going downhill almost as soon as the team arrived for the first round of pre-Olympic World Cup races that drew to a close in Europe last week . Threetime World Cup champion Phil Mahre and his twin brother , Steve , symbolized the problems of the men 's team . The two left the tour and flew home to White Pass , Wash. , to practice on familiar slopes . Their exodus came after Phil careened off a slalom course in Courmayeur , Italy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had finished 23rd and 19th respectively in a giant slalom event at Les Diablerets , Switzerland . Shot : U.S. Alpine director Bill Marolt defended their decision to leave , which they 've done in previous years when things were n't going well in December . Phil , who has the best shot at becoming the first American man to win an Olympic Alpine event , points out that although he did poorly in the early meets last year , too ? racking up only 15 points by Christmas , as compared with 7 this year ? he came back for the final rounds that start in January and won the World Cup . " Hopefully it will be just like last year , " he says , " where everything will just kinda click and fall back into place . " Such wishful thinking was also being expressed by the women 's team , which had also been hit by an avalanche of problems . Twenty-eight-year-old veteran Cindy Nelson , who took home an Olympic bronze medal from Innsbruck in 1976 , tore two ligaments in her right knee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence , she is out of cup competition ? and probably the Olympics , though she is doing therapy furiously . " It would be the comeback of the decade , " she admits , " but it 's possible . " Even more disappointing , McKinney , the 5-foot 4-inch slalom specialist who last season became the first non-European to win an overall World Cup title , is a distant @# sixth in point standings . Her highly regarded teammate Christin Cooper is in seventh place , and Maria Maricich , America 's only downhill hope with Nelson sidelined , has not scored a point . The women , however , bristle at suggestions that they 're not meeting expectations . " It 's not so bad that they 're not cracking one-two-threes , " insists Nelson . " There 's time for that in February . " Head women 's coach Michel Rudigoz adds that he 'd " be happy if we had won every race by now , but it 's better not to be too strong too early , winning everything now and then running out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few World Cup bright spots . Ski jumper Jeff Hastings won a 90-meter event with a 378-foot jump , and Coloradan Kerry Lynch tied redoubtable East German Uwe Dotzauer for first place in the Nordic combined ( which consists of a 70-meter jump on one day and a 15-kilometer cross-country race the next ) . However , champion racer Bill Koch finished a disappointing 21st and 36th in two cross-country events , leaving Jim Galanes as high placer for the United States with a 9th and 10th . What ails the American skiers ? It is n't the punishing " if it 's Wednesday this must be Garmisch-Partenkirchen " travel . As Cooper puts it : " We 're pretty accustomed to that life-style by now . " Marolt blames poor snow conditions that cut down drastically on practice time , as well as the team 's traditional slow start in Europe . According to Lynch , many of the Nordic skiers ? Koch and himself included ? are also pacing themselves so that they will not peak before the Olympics competition . " Everybody 's looking at Billy Koch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ha ! He 's going to surprise them all . " It 's hard to predict what will happen in Sarajevo , but based on World Cup performances so far , there may be some surprises in store . Even with Sweden 's Ingemar Stenmark and Liechtenstein 's Hanni Wenzel ? between them the winners of four golds and a silver medal at Lake Placid in 1980 ? barred from competing at Sarajevo belt cause they earn money by endorsing products , the Europeans look strong . Andreas Wenzel , perhaps seeking revenge for the ousting of his sister , leads the slalom standings ; Yugoslavia 's Bojan Krizaj also looks awesome in that event , and even Poland may luck into a medal or two from the racing Tlalka sisters ( Malgorzata and Dorota ) . " Poles in the top ranks of women skiers ? nobody heard of such a thing before , " marvels Rudigoz . Other than that , it is beginning to look like a replay of the old Swiss-Austrian dominance on the Alpine slopes and the Russo-Scandinavian control of cross-country . Unless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming of the new year . 7t
