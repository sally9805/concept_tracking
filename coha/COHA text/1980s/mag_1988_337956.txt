Mikhail Gorbachev may finally get his way . Two months ago , the Soviet leader said he wanted to begin withdrawing the 115,000 Soviet troops mired in Afghanistan by May 15 , but deadlocked negotiations in Geneva over the precise terms of the pullout cast doubt on his schedule . The snag was caused by Washington 's insistence that the U.S. could arm Afghanistan resistance fighters as long as Moscow continued to provide military help to Kabul 's Communist regime . <P> The Geneva talks were about to break down over that contentious point last week when Gorbachev decided to yield to the U.S. demand . Having won support from the Politburo , all that remained for Gorbachev was to secure agreement from Afghanistan President Najibullah , a former secret-police chief who is reportedly displeased with the Soviet pullout plan . Gorbachev summoned Najibullah to Tashkent , 200 miles north of the Soviet-Afghan border , where the two men conferred along with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze . No details of the talks were released , but a Western diplomat in Moscow said , " I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the ultimate persuader , a combination of arm twisting and reassurance . " <P> When the discussions ended , Gorbachev and Najibullah were all smiles . A joint communique declared with notable finality , " The last obstacles to concluding the agreements have now been removed . " It stated that the withdrawal of the first Soviet units could still begin on May 15 . The next day , at the United Nations-mediated talks in Geneva between Pakistan and Afghanistan , the gloom of recent weeks lifted almost instantly . Diego Cordovez , the U.N . troubleshooter who has shepherded the negotiations for the past six years , emerged from morning sessions with Afghan and Pakistani diplomats and told reporters , " We have discussed ; we have negotiated . That 's over . I want to inform you that the documents are now finalized and open for signature . " <P> Though Cordovez announced that all the parties to the negotiations  --  directly , Afghanistan and Pakistan ; indirectly , the U.S. and the Soviet Union  --  were prepared to sign the accords within a week , the response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviets had yet to answer formally the U.S. demand for the right to arm the rebels at a level " symmetrical " to Soviet military assistance to Kabul . Since the superpowers ' symmetry discussion has not been a part of the Geneva negotiations , it will probably be covered in a separate declaration . Speaking on U.S. television after a futile round of shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East , U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said , " Perhaps what we suggested . will be agreeable to them , but we still want to see the answer . " <P> In Pakistan , which has suffered Afghan air and artillery attacks along the border as well as terror bombings in retribution for Islamabad 's support for the mujahedin , the response to Gorbachev 's concession was more clear-cut . Legislators thumped their desks in approval as President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq told a joint session of the parliament that a Soviet pullout was imminent . He called the development the " miracle of the 20th century , God willing . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
