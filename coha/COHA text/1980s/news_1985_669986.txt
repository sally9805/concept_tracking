This is excerpted from Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew ' s address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday . ( See related story : " REVIEW &; OUTLOOK ( Editorial ) : By Jingo ! "  --  WSJ Oct. 11 , 1985 ) : Decisions made in this august chamber , especially in the decades since 8 December 1941 , have determined the course of human history and settled the shape of the contemporary world . If the era after the war has seen a world relatively at peace and accompanied by an unprecedented degree of human progress , much of the credit must go to American leadership . At a time of domestic disquiet over large imports and the possible loss of jobs , the attention of America ' s legislators has been drawn away from the fundamentals . . . successive administrations and Congresses have successfully pursued for four decades from 1945 : a world in which all peoples can seek to fulfill themselves without having to conquer or to dominate or to exploit other people . I suggest that the 40 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II is not just because of the atomic bomb . The U.S. had learnt the lessons of World Wars I and II , how the desire for the better life through industrialization and trade had caused the squabbles over markets and the expansion of empires in order to build larger markets and acquire resources . The end of World War II and the emergence of the Cold War made the U.S. put determined pressure on the European empires to decolonize . More pertinent , when the war ended the U.S. set out , with her European allies , to establish an open and fair trading system under General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , and a stable system of currency exchange under the original IMF agreement at Bretton Woods . These agreements led to the huge growth in trade , banking and finance throughout the world . These developments have had a most profound impact on the leaders of China after Mao . After nearly three decades of Maoist seclusion and self-sufficiency , Deng Xiaoping decided that closing China ' s doors on the world was the cause of her stagnation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors to trade , investments , technology and tourism . She wants to get the same economic uplift that Japan , South Korea , Taiwan , Hong Kong and ASEAN have had from the free market economies of the West by plugging into their trading and investments power grid . In a few years after this decision , China ' s trade with U.S. and Japan has gone up many times . China is seeking growth through trade , not territorial aggrandizement . Her quest for a better life for her people is through peaceful cooperation in trade , investments and transfer of technology and know-how , not the use of force for territorial conquests and the carving out of a sphere of influence or a trading bloc . China ' s decision is a most significant factor for peace , stability and growth in Asia . For nearly 30 years , from 1949 until Mao died in 1976 , a poor but ideologically fervent China was a ceaseless spoiler of other countries ' economic plans as she undermined their stability . She was an exporter of revolution . She provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southeast Asia . China has , for the present , discounted such support . Every Chinese schoolboy knows how China ' s civilization began : through the unification , over 2 , 000 years ago , of the seven warring states by the emperor Qin Shihuang . China knows from her own history that the time-proven method for a dynamic , vigorous people to achieve greater economic power is to carve out a larger territory with a larger population to form a greater base on which peace and order are established . Then with a wide range of soil and climates and peoples , there will be more wealth from a greater diversity of goods and services for exchange . The success of the countries in East and Southeast Asia has caused much of the Third World to rethink their policies . Once infatuated with socialist economic policies of nationalization and autarchy , Third World nations have now come to see that stagnation and decay have followed . Putting up barriers to America ' s markets would halt the economic advancement of the free-market-oriented developing countries . It would send a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Southeast Asia is no longer an available option . It could set off a chain reaction which would result in a downward spiral of the world economy . The irony is that it was the U.S. and Europe that forced a reluctant China and a hermitlike Japan to open up their countries to trade with the West . They were two Oriental societies happy to be self-sufficient and to keep out the outside world . It seems preposterous that because America has temporary difficulties . . . due in part to an overvalued dollar resulting from high interest rates and a budget deficit , the U.S. should begin to close her markets . Is America willing to write off the peaceful and constructive developments of the last 40 years that she had made possible ? Does America wish to abandon the contest between democracy and the free market on the one hand vs. communism and the controlled economy on the other , when she has nearly won this contest for the hearts and minds of the Third World ?            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
