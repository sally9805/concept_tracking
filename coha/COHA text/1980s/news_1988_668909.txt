The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) won a major victory last week in an effort to curb travel scams that have swept the nation in the last two years . Amy Travel Services , a Naperville-based travel firm and its owners sued last year by the FTC for deceptive sales practices of so-called Vacation Passports , was ordered by Magistrate Joan H. Lefkow in U.S. District Court in Chicago to pay $6. 6 million in restitution to its defrauded clients . Nearly 28 , 000 people nationwide purchased $300 Vacation Passports for alleged bargain trips through Amy ' s subsidiaries-Resort Performance Inc. and Resort Telemarketing Inc. - which operated telephone boiler rooms in Illinois , Indiana , Kentucky , Texas and Colorado . Magistrate Lefkow concluded from testimony that came out during the trial and in court May 2 , that 17 , 406 people who purchased the Vacation Passports did not get their vacations and another 4 , 691 people who requested refunds for the money they paid never got them . She multiplied those numbers by $300 to arrive at the $6 , 629 , 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order were the principal owners of Amy Travel and the other firms-Thomas P. McCann III and James F. Weiland-who were found guilty of misrepresenting the cost of vacation packages , obtaining credit card numbers under false pretenses and billing consumer credit cards without authorization . Lefkow gave the defendants 30 days to deposit restitution funds into a court account and asked the FTC to submit a plan , approved by the court , to distribute the funds . She also ordered any bank or other financial institution holding accounts or assets of McCann and Weiland to turn them over to the court within 30 days . She also ordered McCann and Weiland to keep the FTC informed of their business activities over the next five years when those activities include the sale of any product or service to the public . Robert S. Bennett of Houston , attorney for McCann and Weiland , said he would appeal the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago . Bennett said he filed a motion to stay the judgment as well as a motion for a new trial . " Our position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our case , " involving testimony from an attorney who advised Amy Travel on its operation , he said . Bennett also asserted that the court ' s freezing of Amy ' s assets was an error and challenged the FTC on other legal grounds . While the $6. 6 million restitution figure sounds good , it is likely the figure is more symbolic than real . " There ' s sufficient doubt if the defendants have enough money to make redress , " said attorney Eileen Harrington , assistant director , marketing practice division for the FTC in Washington . " We are attempting to determine the exact amount of their assets and then submit a plan for restitution . " We are not optimistic that we are going to get $6. 6 million , " Harrington said , and urged " those defrauded not to be falsely optimistic ( about recovering their funds ) and not to write the FTC for a check . " When the court determines how much money there is , " we ' ll know how much money is available to carry out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FTC already has the names and addresses of the Amy clients , " so there ' s no need to write again . " What encouraged Harrington , as well as Sally Saltzberg , an FTC staff attorney in Chicago who worked on the case , about Lefkow ' s order was " the judgment will live with these individuals . It will follow them around . " Will these individuals be able to walk away from this ? The answer is a resounding no , " Harrington continued . " They will not be able to get rich by running a similar scam nor will they be able to live high in the future as long as they still owe money under this order . " Harrington said the court sent a message to others engaged in this kind of telemarketing fraud . " The message is the court will not hesitate to fine any firm that follows the practices used by Amy . " She said the Amy case was the first that has gone to trial and concluded in the recent wave of telemarketing travel scams . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frauds , she added , but through negotiated settlements . " In the case of Amy , the defendants were unwilling to settle , so they were brought to trial right away . The result is a major victory for consumers . The court not only found them guilty , but sent a message that this kind of conduct won ' t be tolerated . " Still awaiting a message from U.S. District Court in Chicago is World Travel Vacations Brokers of Alsip . World Travel two years ago introduced the so-called " $31 flights to Hawaii " certificates to Chicagoans and then proceded to scam the nation to the tune of an estimated $28 million from the sale of 700 , 000 certificates , according to testimony heard before U.S. Magistrate Joan Gottschall in December . World Travel remains under a preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Bua last December . World Travel and its owners , Scott Walker and his mother , Carol Walker , were charged with misleading consumers about the price of vacations to Hawaii and failing to make refunds to customers who requested them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the records the FTC and court sought . During the hearing , the FTC said the Walkers borrowed $3 million from World Travel and another $3 million from C-S- K , a holding company . Since the hearing , the FTC impounded World Travel ' s financial records to document certificate sales and income . By all accounts , the records were a mess . Action also is pending before Bua concerning attorneys ' fees sought by Bennett , who represents World Travel as well as Amy Travel . In the meantime , World Travel is out of business as is Amy . Bennett said appeals also are pending in the World Travel case . BankCard Travel of Chicago , also sued by the FTC , continues to operate while the federal agency pursues a settlement in that case . According to the FTC , BankCard sold travel club memberships to MasterCard and Visa credit card holders . BankCard had about 400 , 000 members , who each pay an annual membership of $49. 20 , with gross annual revenues of about $20 million . The complaint alleged that Heinz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual membership fees to consumers ' credit cards and failed to refund charges , even though consumers canceled their memberships within the required time . While the FTC deserves credit for prosecuting Amy , World Travel and BankCard , credit must go to the Illinois attorney general ' s division of consumer fraud which first filed suits against World Travel and Amy Travel last year . Several other states also had filed suits against the two operators . It was after those suits that the FTC stepped in . Despite all the actions taken by states and the FTC , hardly a week goes by without a call or a letter from someone who believes he or she has received an offer of a travel deal " that sounds too good to be true . " Believe me , it is.
