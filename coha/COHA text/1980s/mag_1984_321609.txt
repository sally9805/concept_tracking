Brutal fighting and a Muslim takeover in West Beirut produce an American withdrawl- of sorts <P> Some easy questions to begin with . Last Tuesday ( which after last Friday feels like a month ago ) , President Reagan announced that the U.S. was simultaneously going to open fire on Syrian positions and withdraw the Marines , in slow stages , to ships offshore . Was this a retreat that looked like an escalation or an escalation that looked like a retreat ? Perhaps it was merely the " redeployment " the President called it , a way of offering help to the Gemayel government from a more secure military position . Never mind that there was no Gemayel government , that West Beirut , swirling in its own fires as usual , now belonged to the Amal and Druze militiamen . Were we in or out ? If in , how deeply ? And was it not dangerous to pull back gradually , over a month or months , while taking massive potshots at the enemy ? If out , it meant that the U.S. policy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political defeat for Reagan . Except that the Democrats , evidently not grasping the meaning of " redeployment " either , hailed the Administration for finally moving the Marines . Does anybody know what 's going on ? Enough for starters . <P> Odd that these first questions asked by most Americans last week concerned themselves . It was Lebanon , after all , that seemed to be in trouble . Lebanon again ; the world 's nervous breakdown on public display one more time , the now familiar blanched apartment houses of Beirut crowned with rocket smoke , the collapsing balconies , the stained , scorched skeletons of cars . Every street seems to be either a wilderness or occupied by wild-looking young men crouching and running . One wonders if anyone will ever again walk casually in Beirut . And the inevitable ambulance sirens , the anguished women pleading with the television cameras , small children , arms limp , supine on stretchers . Still , Americans looked homeward , and not solely because of fear for the Marines . Now the questions grew more difficult . First : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ever doing there , " there " being the Lebanons of the world , which for decades have both characterized and exasperated American foreign policy ? <P> As helpless as Americans began to feel about Lebanon , they have felt just as helpless about their nation 's position in the world , and for a good deal longer . Superpower ? Where ? What does it mean to be a superpower in a world whose burning center is not Washington or Moscow but friable Beirut ? Where is the leverage a superiority of arms is supposed to bring ; or is arms superiority the wrong tool for leverage ? If the U.S. is willing to use force in messy places , how much , and for how long ? No great shakes at covert operations , it has fared no better in the open . True , after the U.S. " loses " Lebanon to the Muslims , and indirectly to the Syrians , and even more indirectly to the Soviets , not much may be lost in practical terms . Even the loss of prestige or face may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss lies in what America has yet to find : a way to use power discriminately and effectively .
