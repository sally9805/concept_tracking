What does a designer like Giorgio Armani do with three homes ? Simple . As if they were so many jackets , he unconstructs them . Just a simple sweeping-clear , a concentration on line and form and spare the decoration . <P> His Milan apartment , on a dead-end street only a short walk from his office in Palazzo Durini , is a sort of luxury-class version of a Japanese monk 's cell . He shares the seven rooms with a gray Persian cat named Micio . Except for Micio and a Japanese screen , practically everything in the living area was designed by Armani himself , who is mulling over the addition of furniture to his assorted ventures . Certainly the low couches and chairs here , all covered with satinized cotton , and the sculpted rectangular table in a favorite Armani shade of taupe , represent a strong start . The room is coolly lit by a couple of sloping lamps Armani originally designed to show off one of his collections , and the most insistent color comes from a green tree by a narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of happiness ) . <P> There is no decoration . " I furnished this place , " Armani explains , " by taking things off the walls . " The almost mathematical austerity of the apartment gives way , after a while , to a stealthy sense of tranquillity . It is a little like being in a rock garden , or in a museum where the patrons are the exhibit . <P> The apartment also contains an exercise room , a sizable stretch of bookshelf holding weighty volumes of everything from Ert 's costume designs to Donald Duck 's Uncle Scrooge ( " Wonderful ! My favorite ! Uncle Scrooge is my partner ! He 's Sergio Galeotti ! " ) and a bathroom with a tub of Carrara marble big enough for Shamu the Killer Whale . The tub , Armani 's one concession to abject luxury , also turns out , perhaps significantly , to be impractical . " It is so big , " he admits , " that the water gets cold before it fills up . " <P> His closet , however , returns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designer , " he apologizes , showing a lineup of five navy-blue jackets and one of cashmere wool . In a neighboring closet are a full supply of denim and leather jeans , some old shirts , underwear from Bloomingdale 's arranged by the housemaid in neat rows like grenadiers on parade , and an assortment of shoes , his own make as well as American and English . <P> Like many men without families , Armani has adopted his own , most of whom are employees of long standing who weekend with him at a converted farm house that he owns jointly with Galeotti , in Forte dei Marmi , about three hours ' drive from Milan . The decoration there is a kind of bucolic adaptation of the Milan digs , with the same aquatic excess : in this case , an Olympic-size pool . For sun , and the summers , Armani , Galeotti and pals repair to a Moorish-style domed house on the island of Pantelleria , 50 miles off the coast of Tunisia , where nature has supplied her own aquatic excess in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
