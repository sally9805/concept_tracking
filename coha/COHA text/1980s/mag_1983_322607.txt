STAYING ALIVE Directed by Sylvester Stallone Screenplay by Sylvester Stallone and Norman Wexler <P> It sounded like a match made in show business heaven . John Travolta : instant superstar when he strode down a Brooklyn sidewalk , the white-suited knight in a grungy Camelot , as Tony Manero in Saturday Night Fever ; consolidation of stardom in Grease and Urban Cowboy ; a sensitive actor with a stud 's lean physique . Sylvester Stallone : instant superstar when he laced up his gloves and socked it to the champ for the full 15 in Rocky ; consolidation of stardom in Rockys II and III , which he directed as well as wrote , mixing sentimental bravura with slam-bang action sequences . And who was Tony Manero anyway but Rocky Balboa with faster feet ? You 've seen one athletic , inarticulate , sweet-souled Italian American , you 've seen ' em both . And so the deal was made : pair Travolta and Stallone for a sequel beyond all sequels , a refreshed Saturday Night Fever that would take Tony out of Bay Ridge and put him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Dancin ' ! Cross-cultural amour ! Local boy hits big time ! If he can make it there , he 'll make it anywhere . . . <P> Staying Alive does n't make it anywhere : not as character study , not as an ersatz Chorus Line , not even as a canny exploitation of the good will engendered by Saturday Night Fever . Six years after Tony crossed the Brooklyn Bridge into the city of everyone 's tattered dreams , he is stuck in a rut just off Broadway , teaching jazz dance by day , tending bar at night . Encouraged by his palfriend Jackie ( Cynthia Rhodes ) , Tony auditions for the chorus of a musical called Satan 's Alley-a sort of rock musical comedy version of Dante 's Inferno-and falls for Laura , the show 's star ( Finola Hughes ) . Tony gets the job because , as the musical 's choreographer tells him , " you have anger and a certain intensity . And that 's what I need to make this show work . " Sure enough , by opening night Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final duet into a solo and comes back a star . <P> As always , Travolta is urban gorgeous and very charming . The rest of the film is neither . It brandishes the New York look , where every man needs a shave , and every woman a Porcelana rubdown . The Satan 's Alley production numbers , full of grinding pelvises , heavy metaphors and a climactic ascending platform , have all the pretensions of Cats or a Bob Fosse musical but with none of the spirited style ; this show would never get to previews . Stallone seems not to have noticed or cared . He heads off in opposite directions-toward 42nd Street and Flashdance Avenue-and loses himself in the contradictions . With the exception of one rehearsal sequence , feverishly edited to Brother Frank Stallone 's catchy Far from Over , the movie brings neither kick nor context to its song track ( including five new ones by the Bee Gees ) . The raunchy zest of Tony 's family feuds in the first film turns flat as a ' 50s malted here : he and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie lacks the naive vitality that seduced moviegoers to strut out of the theaters in 1978 and strut right back in again . Staying Alive begs every question but one : Can a movie close on opening day ? <P> - By Richard Corliss
