Are the royal tapes real fakes ? <P> <P> The presses were already rolling at the Nuremberg plant of the West German women 's weekly Die Aktuelle ( circ. 550,000 ) when local court officials slapped the publication with an injunction at 4 a.m. last Friday . Facing a $200,000 fine or six months ' imprisonment , the publishers nevertheless ordered the staff to proceed ; by midmorning , an outsize print run of 925,000 copies was being distributed throughout West Germany . The offending article : a six-page cover story headlined " The Whole Truth About the Phone Calls Between Prince Charles and Lady Diana : No Scandal , but Love , Longing and a Touch of Sadness . " <P> Die Aktuelle was publishing what it described as transcripts of several telephone conversations that were secretly taped while Charles was touring Australia last month . The magazine said it had purchased the transcripts from a Munich literary agent who had obtained them from the British agent of Freelancer Simon Regan . Regan , 38 , a longtime contributor to the sensation-seeking News of the World and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tapes from an unidentified Australian who had bugged the Prince to embarrass the monarchy . But Regan insisted that he had not authorized their sale . As Die Aktuelle 's staff tried to peddle the transcripts on both sides of the Atlantic ( asking price : $50,000 ) , palace reaction was swift-and angry . " If this is true , " rumbled a royal spokesman , " this is a bad day for journalism . " The palace won an injunction from Britain 's high court forbidding Regan from " disclosing , divulging or making use of the contents of the tapes of the telephone conversations or publishing transcripts of them . " Mid rumors that British papers wanted to publish the royal chitchat , Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denounced the transcripts as " despicable " in the House of Commons . <P> By the time Die Aktuelle appeared on West German newsstands , Scotland Yard had been called in to investigate , and Simon Regan was promising his full cooperation . Said the Prince 's solicitor , Matthew Farrer : " We are quite satisfied that the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not take place . " That afternoon , British Secretary of Trade John Biffen banned the import of the offending issue . By Friday night , Charles and Diana had seen all of Die Aktuelle 's transcripts . Their verdict : all were fake . <P> The transcripts themselves were not very convincing . They contained little that had not already been reported or speculated about in the press . Most of the purported conversations were completely innocuous . Diana is quoted as telling Charles how much she misses him , and pleading with him not to leave her alone so long in the future . Charles complains that he is bored with Australia and the lack of humor in Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser . Diana says some of her relatives are getting on her nerves as the wedding approaches .
