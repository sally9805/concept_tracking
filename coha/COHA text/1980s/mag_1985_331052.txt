Lance Morrow 's earliest memory is of loss : " I look for my father , but can not move . . . I stand in the middle of an open space , immobile , under a dark gray sky . " Some four decades have passed since that bleak moment . Morrow , a TIME senior writer , is himself a parent , but he remains a Daedalus figure , trying to come to terms with the past . <P> On the surface , and he had an excess of surface , Hugh Morrow would seem the epitome of a family man ; he was one of eight children and came to be father and stepfather to ten of his own . He was genial , articulate , gregarious , a spokesman for Nelson Rockefeller , intimate of politicians and journalists across the country . But at home he often seemed a figure invested with glamour , forbearance and remoteness . There , " injury and anger gusted inarticulately through the house . The spirit bore a bruise , a grievance : the bruise was mysterious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not assuage it . " <P> To his large brood , Hugh adopted a tone of remote and incomprehensible irony . His children came to believe that somehow they seemed to have " done him a concealed injury , to have stolen something from him , something they may have taken without knowing the wound they were inflicting . " <P> In this elegant and glowing memoir , Lance Morrow sifts time like sand in an hourglass , revisiting the places and stations of his life . They are brilliantly specific , but they resonate far beyond their locales . In Washington , " politics , elections , chicaneries flowed through private conversation . . . marinated in Scotch and cigarette smoke , " and the boy immediately associates tobacco with wisdom and maturity . At Harvard , a fellow student tells him Schopenhauer , the ultimate pessimist , " ' knows the way life is ' . . . life was painful . ' No , ' I would say . ' Life is not like that at all . ' I was terrified that it might be . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he watches a beloved younger brother , " a form of sunlight , " dying of cancer and turns away from the unbearable . Morrow also reaches forward , sometimes into the incalculable future , through his two sons . The elder goes to school with the Shah of Iran 's son , and the author finds the boy " so like his father . . . all hauteur and vulnerabilty delicately balanced . The Shah and his son , my father and I , Jamie and I : I thought about the tenderness and the capacity for violence in the configurations . " <P> Wherever the author goes , father-son parallels seem to stretch to the horizon without touching : in the Roman Catholic Church , which he abandons and rejoins ; in the attitudes of his doctors after Lance , a heavy smoker , suffers a heart attack at 36 ; in the jousting of police and demonstrators . The relationship that causes the greatest internal rift is the one between Hugh Morrow and Nelson Rockefeller . " No one does the words better than Hughie , " Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endorsement to the pastry chef . " Those words , Morrow acrimoniously notes , are what Rockefeller demands for 21 years , along with the deference of a talented man writing below his worth : " In my sight , Rockefeller cost my father something of his manhood .
