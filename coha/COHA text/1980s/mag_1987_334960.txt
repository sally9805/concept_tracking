The most fateful exercise of judicial discretion is the one that starts with the words " I sentence you . . . " Whether to slap the wrist or slam the cell door is a complex and partly subjective decision in which the particulars of the crime , the history of the culprit and the disposition of the judge all play a part . No wonder , then , that a stickup may draw anything from hard time to probation and defense lawyers maneuver to get their cases heard by judges known to go easy . <P> For years such disparities have troubled both liberals concerned about equal justice and conservatives fuming over lenient sentences . To make punishment more uniform , and more certain , Congress in 1984 authorized a commission to devise new sentencing formulas for use in federal courts , where some 40,000 criminal sentences are handed down annually . After 18 months of hearings and study , the U.S. Sentencing Commission last week issued its guidelines . Their tangle of numerical tables may rationalize court penalties , but they are expected to add thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission created a system in which each crime is assigned a " base " number . That figure is then adjusted , depending on such variables as the use of a gun or how much money was stolen or whether the victim was elderly . The resulting number is plugged into a chart that weighs any previous record and comes out with a prescription for the sentence . For example , a bank robber starts by getting 19 penalty points , gets 1 added for taking $15,000 and 9 more for shooting someone and causing serious injury . If the robber served a 14-month prison term five years earlier , the total of 29 points would direct the judge to set a new sentence  --  whir , click  --  between 97 and 121 months . <P> The guidelines represent a compromise between complete judicial discretion and fixed sentences , a now disfavored reform in which specific crimes get unvarying punishments without parole . Under the new federal proposal , judges would retain a small range of discretion and could depart from the guidelines in certain instances . If they did so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the record , and those sentences could be appealed . <P> Even so , the " departure " provisions are too broad for the sole dissenting commission member , Rutgers Law Professor Paul Robinson , who charges ! that the report is riddled with loopholes . " If Congress asked for Rambo , " he says , " what it got was Don Knotts . " Counters Commission Member Stephen Breyer , a federal appeals judge : " Departures should n't occur that often . " When they do , he adds , the reasons that judges give " will be analyzed , and the guidelines will be refined . " The new system is scheduled to go into effect in November , but the commission , which is a permanent body , has recommended that Congress delay implementation until August 1988 in order to let judges try out the guidelines on a voluntary basis .
