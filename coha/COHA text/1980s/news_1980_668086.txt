The Hudson Valley is a land of legends , a mysterious world of Sleepy Hollows , Schroon Rivers , and Tarrytowns , the home of Natty Bumppo and Hiawatha , where Ichabod Crane was haunted by the headless horseman , and where Rip Van Winkle should have known better , for God ' s sake , than to drink Holland gin with a bunch of mountain dwarfs playing ninepins . All of which made Saratoga a perfect setting last weekend for the outdoor concerts that ended this year ' s Newport Jazz Festival , and nobody gave a damn about the drenching rain nor the thunderclaps that cracked in the Adirondack Mountains and rolled down the Hudson Valley to the glen where Dave Brubeck , Zoot Sims and the divine Sarah Vaughan made magic sounds . As it turned out , the Great Conductor in the Sky , as Robert J. Lurtsema calls him , was in tune all weekend , rumbling thunder for Chick Corea at Saratoga on Saturday , then rustling the evergeens gently the next day at sunny Tanglewood , where at least one grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes and goes , but quality music has no fear of time . At Saratoga , to escape the rain , people sought refuge under the awnings at the concession stands , some choosing natural foods , others kielbasa . The hillside was a maze of polyurethane tents , transparent and otherwise , and what are we to surmise about a tent with three bare feet sticking out , tapping time ? Only the devil herself would know for sure what was going on inside . Most people , however , simply said to hell with the rain , spread their blankets on the slope of the hill , and sat down to drown themselves in the music , and did it matter if rain fell on the potato salad ? Of course not , because once you accept it , there ' s a perverse pleasure in being miserable . Ask the man hugging his girl under the umbrella , swaying to Brubeck . Gratefully , The Boston Globe accepted shelter from Lyle French , 34 , who had set up a Chablis concession under a huge green umbrella , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and libation for pain . That ' s when I noticed her , the girl with the purple umbrella , and a beauty she was , in faded jeans and light cotton blouse , dancing barefoot in the park , lovely in the dark , twirling her umbrella this way and that in a marvelous ballet interpretation of Brubeck ' s " Take Five . " Summertime , and the livin ' was easy , and you would have fallen in love with her yourself , with her beauty , her youth , and with her wondrously improvised dance . She was keenly conscious of the graceful lines of her body , the thrust of a shoulder here and the bend of a knee there , delighting in her arched back or her perfectly pointed foot . She danced under a streetlight , but the floodlights at Avery Fisher Hall could not have been more flattering . In and out of the shadows she twirled , then leaped and circled , first round a young oak tree , then around a bearded chap en route to the water fountain , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leap a puddle , then pirouette through it , twisting the umbrella this way and that , as coyly as Gene Kelly who was singing and dancing in the rain before she was born . It was a glorious feeling because she was happy again , laughing at clouds so dark up above , the sun in her heart , she was ready for love . Here and there , by candlelight , couples danced together in rapture , and once in a while , a boy would make a feeble effort to join the dance of the girl with the purple umbrella , but while she had the world on a string , invariably he ' d look like a silly so and so . The moment was so intoxicating that , on a mad impulse , The Boston Globe considered asking her to dance , but only if Chick Corea would come up with a slow one , maybe a waltz . Even as she ate , she danced , holding aloft her paper plate and plastic spoon , bending without effort to pick up her glass of white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace the wine before twirling across the grass . At intermission , in pursuit of the facts , The Boston Globe established that her name was Patricia , that she came from Albany , worked for the state , was 5 feet 8 , of Polish-British extraction , a Libra with brown hair and blue eyes , who had studied jazz and ballet for 12 years , and who loved Brubeck . " I just couldn ' t not move to it , " she said . We may have discussed SALT II , but my notes do not reflect this . She introduced her friend , as she called him , and although The BostonGlobe is not a jealous newspaper , he seemed surprisingly plain , a bit overweight , somewhat scruffy and none too bright . Later , when Sarah Vaughan sang love songs like " Tenderly , " The BostonGlobe returned to the spot where the girl with the purple umbrella had danced . But she had vanished into the night , misty as it was , and all that was left was the sound of her hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
