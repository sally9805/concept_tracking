Finally , of course , there is the evidence of the works . We all know that scholars know vastly more than we about the Last Supper or the Sistine Chapel ceiling , but those works address us so immediately and totally that experiencing them dissolves the metaphorical version of the grime that literal restorers feel it necessary to remove . But Raphael 's most famous works are the frescoes that embellish the Papal chambers  --  the School of Athens , or the Disputa  --  both of which seem too freighted with allusions and learned references for us to unravel them as we troop with other sightseers through the Camera della Segnatura . And then there are the dear Madonnas , luminous embodiments of absolute solicitude and total maternal loge , but to our tastes too cloying , too finally sentimental , to compel . Vasari tells us that Raphael was of an amorous disposition , and even that his death ( at 37 ) was due to heavy lovemaking and a lowered resistance . There is a marvelous painting , La Fornama , said to be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bare breast while pointing to an armband with Raphael 's name , as if to say that it and she belong to him . But little of this eroticism comes through in the chaste Madonnas ; we stand before them respectful but unengaged . Still , he was one of the great artists , and one can not be indifferent to the exhibition of his drawings on view ( until January 3 ) at the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York City . Indeed , precisely because of the spontaneity , the immediacy , the unstudied , free , swift , gestural transcription of presumed feeling drawings promise , these pieces would appear to offer the best solvent for the glaze that has settled over this master 's name and work . So one goes to such an exhibition not just to look at the drawings , which are certain to be marvelous , but to look for Raphael , to seek , across the centuties , a sort of post-PreRaphaelite contact with a nearly vanished sensibility . There are glimpses of him , to be sure , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another order against the other artists who form what the Morgan calls " his Circle " ? somewhat misleadingly , I think , since his circle was composed more of intellectuals and poets and high ecclesiastical personalities than of the artists in his workshop who came under his immediate influence . Yet the personality remains as elusive as ever ; it is difficult to meld the forty-odd drawings by himor said to be by him into a coherent corpus . You are going to have to work to find him , which gives a certain interest to the show . There are a number of reasons for this elusiveness . First , of course , is the fact that the drawings come from the three main periods of Raphael 's career , and show him absorbing , and transforming , the differing styles of three radically different artists : Perugino , to whom he was apprenticed and whose clear Umbrian style is the basic stratum in Raphael 's artistic persona , especially in the Madonnas ; Leonardo , whom he was dazzled by in Florence and whose smoky style , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Michelangelo , whose work on the Sistine ceiling Raphael was allowed , surreptitiously , to see , and which he proceeded , as far as he could , to make his own . Undoubtedly , Perugino 's influence , while it admitted the Leonardesque overlay , impeded Raphael 's full command of Michelangelo 's style , which he aspired to but could not reach . ( " Dry , minute , and defective in design " is how Vasari describes Perugino 's manner . ) So Raphael 's personality flows through the sequence of drawings like a river , whose tributaries are all the streams of High Renaissance expression and invention . It is only at the end , in the magnificent head and hand he drew for the Transfiguration  --  the masterpiece on which he was working at his death , the greatest drawing in the show and , for all I know , the greatest drawing in existence  --  that he comes fully into his own as a genius .                   @ @
