The last time they were here , the season was beginning and both teams talked wistfully of pennants and October . That was the First Season . Last night , they began the Second Season with the realization that October may seem as far away as it did in April , because all that ' s left is second place . Actually , the opener of last night ' s doubleheader was the kind of game that should be played for first place . Reggie Cleveland and Mike Torrez dueled , 1-1 , into the bottom of the eighth , aided and abetted by a half-dozen outstanding defensive plays . It was won , 2- 1 , by the Brewers when Torrez got hurt by a walk and his own fielding deficiencies , but it really was a matter of Reborn Reggie winning rather than Torrez losing . But in the second game , the Sox came back , parlaying the five- hit pitching of Steve Renko ( eight strong innings ) and Bob Satnley and two Fred Lynn homers into a 7-0 victory . In the opener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Jerry Remy . When he re-jammed his left knee rounding second in the sixth , he crumpled down to the ground and had to be helped off the field . " I had seen third uncovered and started to go , stopped and hurt it then , " he said , " but I don ' t think it ' s too bad . I ' ll know more ( today ) when I can gauge the stiffness , but I don ' t think it ' s as bad as last time . " Last time , in May , Remy was out eight games . Last night ' s injury meant that Don Zimmer had to play the second game without Jim Rice , Carl Yastrzmeski , Remy , Chuck Rainey , Tom Burgmeier and Skip Lockwood , and with both Lynn and Jimmy Dwyer limping and Carlton Fisk in left field . The front office may decide today whether or not to send help . Reborn Reggie is now 4-1 , 1.44 since moving into the rotation five starts ago , and 7-3 on the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s RBI double in the second , was hard-hit . The other three were by Fisk , who set up two of the three scoring chances they had in the first four innings with stolen bases . When Fisk stole second as Butch Hobson struck out for the first out in the second , Cleveland also was fortunate . Stormin ' Gorman Thomas , whose single knocked in the winning run , robbed Jimmy Dwyer with a brilliant catch in right-center , one of the two he made , right before Stapleton roped his double into the left-field corner for Torrez ' 1-0 lead . " That was really the only pitch I hung all night , " said Reggie . He hung it to the wrong man . But after that , Fisk ' s bunt single in the fourth and his two-out single in the ninth were the only hits . Torrez ( 4-9 ) pitched well . He even had a no-hitter two outs into the fourth . But in the fifth , the 1-0 lead was lost , helped by a messed-up rundown whose consequences we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on Lezcano ' s drive to the warning track when Dick Davis hit a routine two-hopper to Rick Burleson . Oglivie broke for third , beginning the rundown , which the Red Sox didn ' t handle properly , letting Oglivie stay alive too and enabling Davis to reach second . Davis was thus in scoring position when Jim Gantner dumped a single into left-center . The question remains whether or not that caused Torrez to lose his concentration , because Charlie Moore lined the next pitch into the right- field corner . Here the Red Sox made what Fisk called " three good plays . " Dwyer got to the ball in the corner and came up throwing for a perfect relay . Remy spun and made a perfect relay to the plate . And Fisk dived in front of Gantner ' s tag , " tried to get my glove in front of the plate , " did , and wound up with Gantner ' s spike in his glove . And the out . Dwyer made another good relay in the eighth , this time in left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torrez had walked Don Money with one out , and Cecil Cooper hit a bouncer through the box . Torrez was falling toward first , but the ball went right over the mound , playable for a pitcher with fielding skills , and Torrez couldn ' t get near it . First and second . Thomas banged the next pitch inside the third-base bag for the winning run . They did jump back in the second game , knocking Lary Sorensen out in the third after taking a quick 4-0 lead . Lynn followed another Stapleton double in the first with his ninth homer , a drive over the right-field fence . Dwight Evans , who had knocked in one run in a month , doubled between Sal Bando and the bag for a third run in the second . Then Stapleton singled , Tony Perez doubled off the top of the right-field fence and Fisk lined his fourth single of the night to make it 4-0 with one out in the third , and Mr. Sorensen was gone . The Red Sox got a fifth run for Renko in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lefthanded hitters out . He walked Dave Rader and Evans , and after Rader was thrown out as the lead of an attempted double steal , Rick Burleson lined a single for the 5-0 lead . With the bullpen down to Bill Campbell , Dick Drago , Wilhelmus Remmerswaal and Bob Stanley , Renko , like Torrez , gave Zimmer the kind of performance he needed . Renko shut the Brewers out for seven innings , his only trouble coming in the third when Hobson made a pair of errors .
