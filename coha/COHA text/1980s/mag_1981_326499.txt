Haig ousts an envoy who spoke up once too often <P> When Israeli planes bombed Beirut last month , Secretary of State Alexander Haig was publicly criticized for being too soft on Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and for not having a coherent Middle East policy . Haig 's patience was further strained when Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger assailed Begin 's lack of " moderation , " a more reproachful view than that of the State Department . So when Haig learned that one of his own ambassadors , Robert Neumann in Saudi Arabia , had joined the chorus of dissent , he decided to make his own feelings very plain . <P> During a meeting in Washington on July 20 with Senator Charles Percy , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , Neumann reportedly denounced Haig 's refusal to say that the Administration 's delay in shipping F-16 fighters to Israel was punishment for the Beirut raid . Word of that disloyalty reached the Secretary , and Neumann was called in for a loud dressing down . The next day , Haig met privately with President Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neumann , who had been in Saudi Arabia for only two months , announced his resignation " for personal reasons . " <P> Since taking office , Haig has mounted a crusade to make the Administration speak with one voice on foreign policy issues , an effort that has sometimes brought him into collision with Weinberger , National Security Adviser Richard Allen and occasionally people in his own department . Neumann had earlier displeased Haig by pushing for the U.S. to sell Saudi Arabia five sophisticated AWACS radar and command center planes , while Haig saw no reason to rush the deal . To make matters worse , when Israel destroyed an Iraqi nuclear power plant in June , Neumann complained that U.S. reaction had been excessively mild . <P> Neumann had another strike against him : his close association with Richard Allen , whom Haig dislikes . A scholarly former Ambassador to Afghanistan and Morocco , Neumann was vice chairman of the Georgetown University Center for Strategic and International Studies when Allen , a founder of the center , picked him to head Reagan 's transition team at the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dismissed most of its members as soon as he took office . Neumann survived-but without ever gaining the Secretary 's trust . <P> By ousting an Allen protg , Haig has demonstrated that his sometimes shaky status in the Administration is on the rise again . His choice for Neumann 's replacement : Ambassador to the Philippines Richard Murphy , 51 , a career diplomat with pro-Arab sympathies similar to those of Neumann . Murphy , TIME has learned , was Haig 's original choice for the Saudi Arabia post .
