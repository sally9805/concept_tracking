Have you heard ? There 's a Belgian beer that makes you impotent , the Chinese once caught President Nixon pocketing a priceless teacup , and dim-witted ecologists are renting airplanes to drop poisonous snakes on the forests of France . <P> Dedicated Rumormonger Jean-Noel Kapferer , 38 , has heard those spurious stories and some 10,000 other tales . A Parisian academic , Kapferer , in 1984 , created the Foundation for the Study of Rumors . His office , not far from the Paris Stock Exchange , runs a 24-hour hotline dedicated to collecting examples of tattle while they are still fresh . " It 's very important to hear about them the instant they start , " he says . " A rumor is like a fire . You have to be on the spot . Otherwise you find yourself working on hearsay about hearsay . " <P> The rumor mill is a semicovert part of the information media , says Kapferer , who holds an American Ph.D . in social psychology from Northwestern University and teaches at France 's School for Advanced Commercial Studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsessions of a society . " They are , " he says , " an echo of ourselves . " <P> Kapferer assumes that rumors , which he defines rather woodenly as nonofficial information circulating within a social group , are not just idle tales . Long-lived rumors of snakes or spiders coming out of clumps of bananas or children 's teddy bears , he believes , probably have a strong xenophobic component  --  fear of Africa , where bananas grow , or Asia , where stuffed animals are made . <P> Hearsay can bring psychic benefits to speaker and listener alike . A case in point is the false teacup story about President Nixon , which Kapferer says was spread by the official Chinese press . Instead of challenging the President , so the story goes , authorities arranged to have a performing magician pull the cup out of Nixon 's briefcase and replace it with a cheap imitation . Kapferer thinks this rumor offered folk wisdom on how to deal with foreigners . " It showed the essential traits of the image the Chinese have of themselves , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese over the crafty foreigner , and the ability of the Chinese to know how to act without having anyone lose face . " The tale that ecologists were using airplanes to drop vipers into the woods of Perigord ( as prey for endangered hawks ) expressed provincial contempt for ecologists as impractical outsiders . " No one bothered to ask whether it would n't be cheaper to rent a car or truck to release the snakes , " says Kapferer , " or whether the snakes would survive a fall from an airplane . " <P> Some stories voice new and realistic fears in coded form . A wild rumor that McDonald 's was mixing earthworms into its hamburger meat spread across the U.S. as concern about junk food was rising . " The worm represented , on the one hand , the garbage food , " says Kapferer , " and , on the other hand , the internal destruction that comes when you eat it . Far from being an aberration on the part of a bunch of crazies , this rumor was a cry of alarm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
