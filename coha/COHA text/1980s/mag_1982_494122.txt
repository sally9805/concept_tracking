Byron , Shelley , Keats : these . I was told in my schooldays , were the great English Romantics , following on a senior trio ? Wordsworth , Coleridge , and Southey . I can only suppose that historians make these lists because they adore triads . Keats and Shelley do , of course , have the disconcerting similarity of opposites : the mirror of the ideal and spiritual of Shelley confronting the mirror of flesh-asdream of Keats . But to speak of Byron as " Romantic " in any way resembling Shelley and Keats is to misrepresent everything about him except that he belonged to the same generation as they . One thing that Wordsworth , Coleridge , Shelley , and Keats ? though not Byron ? had in common was the importance they attached to imagination as a primary creating and world-envisioning force . For Coleridge , the poetic imagination was the instrument of mind closest to the creating " I am " of God . For poetry was capable of transforming society . For Keats it could create beauty in poems equal with sensations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetic imagination had any such powers . In a letter to his bride-to-be Annabelle Milbanke ( November 29 , 1813 ) , he writes : I by no means rank poetry or poets high in the scale of intellect ? this may look like Affectation ? hut it is my real opinion ? it is the lava of the imagination whose eruption prevents an earthquake ? they say poets never or rarely go mad but they are generally so near it ? that I can not help thinking rhyme is so far useful in anticipating or preventing the disorder . I prefer the talents of action ? of war ? or the Senate ? or even of Science ? to all the speculations of these mere dreamers of another existence ( I do n't mean religiously but land-fully ) and spectators of this . This rings true because it is based on Byron 's own experience of writing poetry to rid himself of pent-up delirium , and also of his yearning for a life of action . He had his own generation in mind ? and perhaps Shelley in particular ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " By a curious coincidence , there is a passage in The Fall of Hyperion ( Keats 's incomplete attempt to rewrite Hyperion ? at a time when he already knew that he was dying of consumption ) in which , like Byron in the letter I have quoted , Keats also ranks poets below men of action , though by these he means healers of sickness and helpers of the poor , not Byron 's soldiers and Senators . The healers Keats has in mind , whom he regards as superior to . mock lyrists , large self-worshippers , And careless Hectorers in proud , had , verse are those who come to grips with sick-ness and poverty and act to remedy them , They are ... those to whom the miseries of the world Are misery , and will not let them rest . The prophetess Moneta who , in The Fall of Hyperion is the projection of Keats 's own poetic conscience , rebukes him for being " a dreaming thing " inferior to the healers who seek to remedy the world 's ills , and who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human face : No music but a happy-noted voice ? They come not here , they have no thought to come And thou art here for thou art less than they . What benefit canst thou do , or all thy tribe , To the great world . Thou art a dreaming thing ; A fever of thyself ? think of the Earth The description of the poet as a fever of himself fits Byron 's description of him as one who in moments of near-disorder overflows with the " lava of the imagination . " But Byron sees the imagination as a purely subjective affair , the poet as his own self-dramatist writing the speeches of the role he plays in life . Keats blames himself and his fellow poets for what he regards as failure of imagination ? allowing imagination when confronted by terrible objective realities of the world , to lapse into subjective dream , failing to envision the world 's misery . Those who deal with sickness with real instruments of healing are superior to those who turn away from it into their dreams . But rejecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reject them as poets : The poet and the dreamer are distinct , Diverse . sheer opposite . antipodes . The " weak dreamer " is not a true poet . The true poet is wide awake with visions that meet terrible reality . To do so , the poet has to become Apollo in that god 's double aspect ? both visionary , who heals , and also " misty pestilence " that rots false worshipers and purges the temple of them . Keats concludes the passage quoted above , about " mock lyrists " and " careless hectorers " ( he is thinking of Shelley and Byron ) , with the savage lines written out of the hitter anticipation of his own death , his cruel envy of the poets who will survive him : Though I breathe death with them . it will be life To see them sprawl before me into graves . In The Fall of Hyperion , Keats looks forward to Rimbaud , the idea of the poet as visionary and seer , voyeur . Byron , on the contrary , looks hack to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least that the poet should become visionary . He wants poetry to be of the world and he blames his own generation ? including among them himself ? for its decadence In a letter to John Murray ( September 15 , 1817 ) in which he has been discussing Moore 's Laliait Rookh , he writes : With regard to poetry in general I am convinced the more I think of it ? that he and all of us ? Scott ? Southey ? Wordsworth ? Moore ? Campbell ? I ? are all in the wrong ? one as much as another ? that we are upon a wrong revolutionary poetical system ? or systems ? not worth a damn in itself ? &; from which none but Rogers and Crabbe are free ? and that the present &; next generations wilt finally he of this opinion. ? I am the more confirmed in this ? by having lately gone over some of our classics ? particularly Pope ? whorn 1 tried in this way ? I took Moore 's poems &; my own &; some others ? &; went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was really astonished ( as I ought not to have been so ) and mortified at the ineffable - distance on point of sense ? harmonyeffect ? and even Imaginatiim Passion ? dt Invention ? between the little Queen Anne 's Man ? &; us of the lower Empire ? depend upon it , it is all Horace then , and Claudian now among us . C LEARIY BYRON felt no sympathy with the Romantic idea of the poet being existent in his poetry as subjective consciousness identical with the poem . For him , Pope 's strength lay in the fact that as a man he lived in the world and made poetry out of the objective material of the world . Pope and Dryden wrote from the standpoint of aristocratic sensibility , in which the poet as craftsman in his work and as friend of aristocratic patrons stood outside his poetry , just as the maker of a fine piece of jewelry . or a watch , stands outside the material with which he works his miracle of craftsmanship . Comparing his poetry with that of Pope , Byron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in which in Childe Harold he made himself and his moods the subject of his poetry . What was wrong for him with his own poetry and that of his generation was the identification of the poetry with the poet . In his letters Byron sometimes refers to his poetry as " scribbling , " though he confesses that it is torment to him to write poetry : the torment of " excited passion . " He only considered himself a poet at such moments of excitement . He admits in a letter to Thomas Moore ( from Ravenna , July 5 , 1821 ) I have had a friend of your Mr. Irving 's ? a very pretty lad ? a Mr. Coolidge. of Boston ? only somewhat too full of poesy and " entusy-musy . " I was very civil to him during his kw hours ' stay and talked with him much of Irving , whose writings are my delight . But I suspect that he did not take quite so much to me. from his having expected to meet a misanthropical gentleman , in wolf-skin breeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of this world , I can never get people to understand that poetry is the expression of excited passion , and that there is no such thing as a life of passion any more than a continuous earthquake , or an eternal fever . Besides , who would ever shave themselves in such a state ? r OR BYRON poetry was a matter of instantly expressing his feelings , when he was in a highly agitated state of mind , He achieved the greatest facility of expression in Beppo , The Vision of Judgement and , supremely , in Don Juan , poems written in a very complex stanza form that he commanded with absolute mastery and wrote with lightning ease . In his hands this meter was responsive to changes of mood from frivolous to sententious , cynical to impassioned , instantaneous with narrative , comment , and feeling at the very moment of writing . Goethe , who admired Byron enormously , remarked that he was incapable of thinking . But the great merit of Don Juan is that the poetry never stops to think . His letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the pen onto the page without intervention of any self-censorship or hesitancy . Some screening mechanism that causes most men to censor their thoughts with afterthoughts at the very moment they are expressing them seems to have been lacking in Byron . He wrote down everything that happened to him or that occurred to him . But he is all the society to which he belongs . The things he writes about are the things the people in circles in which he moved did and talked about but also knew how and when to suppress as subjects of conversation . Apart from a very strong individual character and this social personality , he seems to have had very little personal psychology . It is difficult to think of Byron having what we call an " unconscious . " Everything with him seems accessible . There is much temperament but no hidden depths . We learn , because he tells us it is so , that when he was a child he was interfered with ? sexually ? by a nursemaid . Well , that seems food for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly to what extent this early episode affected his later sex life . It is the same with his incestuous love for his half-sister Aurora Leigh and with his club foot . The connection of this deformity ? which he took pains to hide , wearing trousers when he went swimming ? with his athletic prowess at boxing , swimming , riding , and unremitting sexual activity , is obvious to us as it must have been to him . Yet the thing to note about his sexual life is that , given the fact that its virulence arose from neurosis , that it was so uninhibitedly successful . No one ever complained about his sexual performance . In the scandalous gossip of the time , he goes on at it like a nonstop pornographic movie . Frederic Raphael makes , rightly , a good deal of his homosexuality with which ( apart from the nursemaid ) his sexual life began at Harrow and Cambridge , and ended at Missolonghi in his last ( and unrequitted ) love for a Greek boy , referred to in the last poem that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life ? Plymouth harbor , back streets in Venice , etc. ? separate , and not interfering with , the main pattern of his pursuit of , and being pursued by , ladies . It is significant that in all the volumes of his letters there are no love letters to men . The boys he went with were not of a social class for him to correspond with . Frederic Raphael ? in his lively and compressed biography ? is best in his account of Byron 's youth and in his discussion of the circumstances that led to the breakdown of his marriage : It is one of the oddities of Byron 's life that comparatively little of it was out of the ordinary , though much was extraordinarily exaggerated by the rhetoric of his responses . The vividness of his reaction is often more remarkable than his experience : what would have grazed another drew blood from him . This in part explains his great popularity with his contemporaries . Instead of being a Romantic with an inner self , like Wordsworth , Keats , or Shelley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star . Reading Leslie Marchand 's excellently edited Selected Letters and Journals , one turns from the letters to the journals , thinking perhaps : " Well , I have had so much of the man of the world telling of his affairs to his friends , now I shall turn to the Poet communing with his inner self . " One discovers , though , that the letters ( apart from a few sobering hung-up reflections ) are simply letters from Byron to Byron . There ai n't no Inner Self . All the same , despite the resounding emptiness , Byron is in no sense a fraud . He has the utmost truth of his qualities , and that is why his life was such a scandal to English society . He told the truth about their goings on . His letters are so wonderful precisely because this form of communication is his natural element , like a stream he swims in , concealing only his clubbed foot from the otherwise very public gaze . What after all is Don Juan but a hell-fire letter written from abroad by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into exile ? It is as though Milton 's Satan , having been thrown out of heaven , wrote , from the infernal regions , a letter hack to God and the heavenly hosts saying how much he preferred the lotiche company he now kept to that of the hypocritical and boring inhabitants of the empyrean . Raphael . in his account of the last months of Byron 's life , spent in Greece where he advised and to some extent led the Greek fighters for independence in the war against the Turks , depicts the poet become , for a short time , and in quite inappropriate circumstances , the man of action and military leader . In Greece Byron certainly showed the cour- diplomacy required of a commander of such an expedition . For his readers he was , and remains , a poet of genius , and that is all they require him to be . But to himself he was , I am sure , a frustrated man of action who used his immense poetic gifts to express his frustration at never having found among his many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and traveler , his true vocation , which was to be a leader of men . He was able to write speeches for all the roles that were failures or at best filling up time and sowing wild oats while he awaited the real one . We can he grateful that he never found it , because while he could write speeches for the false ones , it is difficult to think that he could have written poetry for the statesman , governor , or military commander , which from his point of view , he should have been .
