THE NATION Independence Day <P> The little old voter fooled everybody . <P> The experts thought they had him analyzed , charted , taped and ready for delivery . But the independent voter apparently was n't telling anybody anything . This week he went to the polls and cast his secret ballot . In Illinois , a victorious Democratic candidate for the Senate , Paul Douglas , declared : " This is a people 's victory . " He was right . <P> Why had the voters chosen Harry Truman and given the Democrats sweeping control of both Senate and House ? For a number of reasons , not the least of which was little old Harry Truman . <P> The President had fought a single-handed fight without parallel in U.S. history . He did it all himself , after Democratic liberal and labor leaders had tried their best to depose him . He had plugged and pounded his way across the country . He had a kind of self-induced fervor which roused the admiring cry of " Pour it on , Harry ! " <P> Harry Truman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Republicans might not be able to stand it . But the Republic could .
