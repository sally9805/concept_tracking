 | Forget homework . Forget school troubles and boy troubles and parent troubles . For Carmen Smith , 19 years old , World War III was being waged in a prize ring on screen at the Sack Cinema 57 in Boston , and Russia , in the person of a blood-doped bionic giant named Ivan Drago , appeared to be winning . " You gon na get your ass whipped , boy , " Carmen was muttering half in prayer , but the punches were raining down like MIRV'ed missiles on her champion and America 's , and she and most of the kids around her were squirming deeper into the dusty red plush of their seats , waiting for the end . And then , suddenly , the good guy ? our guy ? was on the attack again , answering the Russian blow for blow , and Carmen bounced to her feet with the others , screaming , " Go , Rocky , go ! Go , Rocky , go ! " Rocky , of course , was an up-from-the-canvas palooka named Rocky Balboa , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green Beret machinetooled to kill in Vietnam , are the twin icons of a flag-waving , Redbashing new nationalism in our mass culture . They are the creatures of one Michael Sylvester Stallone , an actor , writer and director of otherwise unexceptional gifts ; his face droops in key places like a melting waxwork , his voice sounds by his own estimate like a Mafia pallbearer 's , and his announced notion of the ideal screenplay would consist of a single word of dialogue . But his " Rambo : First Blood Part II " in the spring and now " Rocky IV " in the fall have brought the mythic American hero downstage center again , standing tall after years in hiding , ready to take on the world with guns , knives , gloves or bare knuckles . Their breakaway success at the box office is , in the eyes of Rocky 's chief hypester , Irv Ivers , marketing president of MGM/UA , a case of simple hero worship . " America has always wanted a hero it can identify with , " he enthuses . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ivers is , of course , an interested party , and his reverence for his property is not widely shared among critics , cinematic or social . Son of Rambo was widely dismissed as a revenge fantasy and Great-Grandson of Rocky as the burned-out end of a spent series ; the daily reviewers called it empty , crude , primitive , boring , bloated , hollow , mush-headed , butter-brained , elephantine , witless , redundant and , in one Hobbesian spasm in The Baltimore Sun , " loud , stupid , nasty . brutish and short . " Vietnam veterans attacked Rambo for his war psychosis . Feminists savaged Rocky for his unregenerate machismo . Psychologists worried about the romanticized violence in both film cycles ? the implicit message that the problems of 1985 can be solved in the manner of the frontier , by hitting or shooting them . Ticket sales : Nobody much likes Stallone or his works , that is to say , except the people , and not , as widely supposed , just teen-age boys ; nearly half the cash customers , after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are women . " Rambo " rang up $32 million in ticket sales in its first six days , the third best launch in history , and has grossed $150 million thus far . " Rocky IV " did $32 million in five days , the strongest nonsummer opening ever , and pushed the total domestic take for the series over $400 million . The numbers owed much to shrewd marketing strategies ? to saturating screens with trailers long in advance and rushing the films to theaters ahead of the seasonal competition . But their deeper source was Stallone 's own intuitive ? or , as some prefer , cynical ? feel for the Zeitgeist . He taps the same wellsprings as Bruce Springsteen , say , or Ronald Reagan ; he is filmmaker to a damnmad blue-collar America that does n't want to take it anymore . He is suitably modest , for publication , about his folk genius ; he likes to say it was his characters who were at the right place at the right moment in our history . He thinks of himself as an artist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat surrounded by the appurtenances of art ? a Diego Rivera and a Chagall , a copy of " Ulysses " cheek by jowl with a biography of Rocky Marciano and the leatherbound scripts of his own growing oeuvre . But art to him is instinct rather than cerebration , " like playing football in the dark , " he says . " You do n't know when you 're going to get tackled ? you just have to go for it . " First Rocky and then Rambo arrived to him on the wash of patriotism ? even jingoism , he concedes ? that swept the country beginning in the Bicentennial year of 1976 and crested in the Age of Reagan . " And I happened to get caught in it , " he told his visitor . " It 's like a guy who goes out fishing and gets caught in a tidal wave . " He was not the first to ride that wave , and he is not swimming alone in it now ; a generation of cinematic pop artists also sensed America 's weariness with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its thirst for an older style of champion ? a white-hat in city clothes , this time , or combat khakis . The worship of the warrior hero is at least as old as Hercules , and in America it has grown its own frontier strain : the " legitimate savage , " historian Stan K. Schultz calls him , who operates outside the laws and strictures of civilization and uses violent means to worthy ends . Some scholars see Clint Eastwood 's " Dirty Harry " as the precursor of his return to the popcorn circuit after a long absence ; others nominate other stars in other star vehicles . Suddenly the silver screen seems crowded with lonewolf heroes dispensing politics and justice out of the barrels of .357 magnums ? Charles Bronson stalking muggers on the S 0 C 1 E T Y  | subway , Chuck Norris hunting MIA 's in Vietnam , Arnold Schwarzenegger standing off an army in " Commando " with weapons including a severed arm . But Stallone 's ingenious comic-strip artistry has zapped them all ; his success with two series at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry . That success has become a bit of a prison for him , spoiling practically everything else he tries in the movies ; his Rambo/Rocky persona is too powerful for ensemble playing . Yet he can not seem to escape it . A Rambo III is already in planning , and while Stallone has been trying to retire Rocky through four pictures , the economic determinism of Hollywood makes a fifth seem almost inexorable . " The studio seems to think so , " he says , smiling a smile of handsomely rewarded ruefulness . Kidvid hour : Thus , for the moment , he is trapped inside his brainchildren and crying all the way to the bank . " Rocky IV " is in 1,400 theaters now and will spread to a record 2,200 this week . ( " You wo n't have to knock yourself out to find it this Christmas , " MGM/UA 's Ivers said with a mercenary grin . ) Rocky dolls and Rambo water guns are in the toy stores . A cartoon series about Rambo ? a nonviolent , nature-loving Rambo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidvid hour . A New York modeling agency ran a Rambo look-alike contest ; the winners got to dress up ( or down ) as Rambo and deliver gag " Rambo-Grams , " with the warning to the recipient , " Take it or else . " In Houston a new saloon named Rambose opened , with camouflage nets for decor and a buffet served from an army stretcher . Even the president wished aloud for a Rambo to send to the next hostage crisis , and Fritz Mondale played the theme from " Rocky " whenever he won a primary from Gary Hart . Stallone 's climb to the top of the hero business was roundabout , begun before heroics were fully back in fashion . There were trace elements of the antihero in the Rocky Balboa we first met nine years ago , and of Stallone 's own life as well ? the struggles of the Hollywood equivalent of a gym rat hanging out around a practice ring and hoping for the big break . Rocky was a club fighter of 30 at the time , a " ham-and-egger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pedigree ( 19 juvenile arrests , seven schools in two years ) and nothing in his pro record ( 44 wins , 20 losses ) to indicate much more than a capacity to absorb punishment . " I 'm at least half a bum , y'know ? " he told his lady Adrian , a plain-Jane shopgirl until she took her glasses off and became beautiful . Rocky was a product , culturally , of the Age of Limits , and when he was chosen by whim to fight a Muhammad Ali clone named Apollo Creed for the heavyweight title , his expectations were suitably low . " A11 I want to do is go the distance , " he said . " . . . When that bell rings and I 'm still standing , I 'll know for the first time in my life , see , that I were n't just another bum from the neighborhood . " The rest is folk history . He went the distance that time , won the championship in a rematch , lost it to Mr. T , won it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with selfdoubt and ? in contrast to the neurasthenic ' 60s heroes ? invariably won . ( " ' Cause I 'm a fighter , " he concludes in " Rocky IV . " " I did n't ask to be one , but that 's what I am . That 's the way I 'm made . " ) In the process , he knocked the rust off the whole canon of traditional American values and became their exemplar . He loved his family . He was loyal to his friends . He was kind to animals . He believed in the American Dream of opportunity for all , and achieved it by hard , unremitting labor . He raised the work ethic to a nearly religious plain ; his training for his fights became a saintly mortification of the flesh , a rite of purification requiring his retreat to various wildernesses ? a meat-packing plant , a hostile ghetto gym and finally , in " Rocky IV , " the frozen steppes of Russia . Where next ? The stories took on a relentless sameness from sequel to sequel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no surprises anymore . " Where do you go ? " he asked himself , and his answer was deeper into minimalism ? shorter films , flashier images , louder music , less talk , more action and longer flashbacks to earlier installments in the series . Rocky became less a character , the wised-up Candide from back-street Philadelphia , than a checklist of virtues and a balance sheet of pain , given and received . The predictability of the Rockys had always been one of their attractions , " like going to McDonald 's for dinner , " David Marc , a Brandeis professor of American studies , says . " You know you 're not getting gourmet stuff , but it 's fun and safe . " By " Rocky IV , " the experience had become nearly ritual , like mass at San Vitale in Ravenna ; the players had been worn as smooth and flat as the saints in the mosaic , and the story line was as dependable as liturgy . The difference , this time , was that " Rocky IV " emerged from Stallone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land and allowed him to politicize his 60 NEWSWEEK : DECEMBER 23 , 1985  | vision ; the ham-and-egger from Mighty Mickey 's gym in Philly had been transmogrified into the ultimate cold warrior , taking on the best the Soviets had to offer in gladiatorial combat . A president of the United States had declared Russia the Evil Empire . A deep chill had settled over U.S.-Soviet relations and had spread into popular culture at a pitch unheard since the 1950s ? into sports , movies , comedy and even television commercials . A particularly crude promo for Wendy 's hamburgers pictured a Soviet fashion show with a single stout model in a babushka and a dowdy gray frock . For evening wear , the same woman modeled the same dress with a flashlight ; for resort wear , the same ensemble again , this time with a beach ball . Rocky was preceded into geopolitics by his doppelganger Rambo , who had been mopping up commies while Rocky was still stopping punches at the Resurrection Athletic Club . John J. Rambo is Rocky as he might be after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after one extended tour in Vietnam and another in an American prison quarry doing hard time for blowing up an unfriendly town . Rocky 's theater of war is the prize ring ; the combat there , while brutal , is contained by the ropes and or- dered by the rules . Rambo 's is the bush , and the law of the bush is the law of the jungle . " To survive war , you have to become war , " he says , and he has . He was a Medal of Honor winner in a war that was , in the politics of his movies , a lie , and when he is sent back in to find a campful of American POW 's , that is a lie , too ? a mission betrayed from birth by his own government . " Sir , do we get to win this time ? " he asks when he is recruited for the job . " This time it 's up to you , " his ex-CO says . It is n't , not really , but Rambo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would have made a battalion proud in the real war . His contempt for politicians remains murderous ; his regard for America survives . " Hate ? " he says . " I 'd die for it . . . I want what every other guy who came over here and spilled his guts and gave everything he had wants ? for our country to love us as much as we love it . " In the iconography of the Stallone movies , Rambo is a man of the past shooting up the past ? those days of shame when America lost a war , witnessed the disgrace of a government , knuckled under to mullahs , sheiks and tin-pot dictators and seemed immobilized by the difficulties of doing something about anything . His last paroxysm of violence , this time around , is directed not at the men who betrayed him but at the machines lining their cybernated command post ; the computers stand for complication against common sense , for bureaucracy against people , for paralysis against action . His rage is meant to be cathartic , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there with their own wars to fight . It works for the audience , or seems to in their deep , visceral response to the movie . It does not for Rambo ; he is imprisoned in history , his own and America 's . It is instead Rocky Balboa who stands for the future in the world according to Sly ; standing in the ring in Moscow on Christmas Day , the flag around his shoulders and the slain Drago at his feet , he is the apotheosis of a new America , open , tough , disciplined , confident and unabashed at having and using power . Stal- NEWSWEEK : DECEMBER 23 , 1985 61 @#  | lone had written scenes aligning the American establishment against Rocky ; the boxing commission , in one , forced him to give up his title if he insisted on fighting Drago , and the government , in another , threatened to revoke his passport if he tried . But those perfidies belonged to the Rambo , not the Rocky canon , and they were left on the cutting-room floor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced to parable or even fable . Rocky is the self-made champion of freedom , Drago the machine-made product of the state . The outcome , even for newcomers to the formula , is a foregone conclusion . Jingo-jangle : What the early box-office returns suggest is that America was ready for such a fantasy , though only up to a point ; the roar of the crowd gives way to titters , in some theaters , when Rocky uses the moment of his triumph to plead for peace and gets the whole Soviet house applauding , even the Gorbachev lookalike in the Politburo box . It is what one scholar calls the conquistador spirit that people come to see , a kind of Grenada in a prize ring at similarly low cost with similarly satisfying results . The jingo jangle Stallone admits is at the heart of the work is , in his eyes , not a bad thing ? not after the shoving around America took in the world of the ' 70s . " They just pushed , " he mused , " until finally the giant said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I have n't done anything that 's that atrocious . ' ... There 's nothing wrong with being fit and strong and powerful and , if necessary , to flex some muscle . We 're back to geopolitics on an even keel . We 're not coming in there quaking , What do I do ? ' We 're coming in as an equal . We 're now in the proper weight class . " Rocky 's victories and Rambo 's do not count for much even in their own terms and do not live long after the 90-minute running time of Stallone 's reductionist late works . But the two of them descend from a long bloodline of warrior heroes in America 's popular culture ? soldier heroes who do battle under the codes and conventions of war and outlaw heroes who use private violence when armies , posses and policemen fail . They date at least to the Minutemen , to Davy Crockett and Dan'l Boone , and they have recurred in cycles in many guises ? as cowboys and cavalrymen , as private eyes and rogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the unlikely personae of a ring-worn fighter and a stressed-out soldier . They are nearly as much a part of the symbolic furniture of Reagan 's America as the president himself ? a can-do America re-emergent , in his vision , from a can'tdo past . " America thinks it 's about time John Wayne got back in the saddle again , " says historian Schultz , a professor at the University of Wisconsin ? only this time the Duke is Sly Stallone . Not all students of our mass culture are happy with what the Rambo/Rocky phenomenon says about the state of our communal fantasy life . The Rocky movies teach the traditional values of grit and hard work , but when Robert Fillman , a 10-year-old in Boston , was asked what he liked about them , he answered readily , " He always wins . " The Rambo cycle is bloodier and more nihilist , the chronicle of a nearly mute hero whose natural state is war and whose vocabulary is. sudden death . At a recent class on war films at Notre Dame , a student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In the trash can , " Anderson replied . To his astonishment , a sizable share of the class rebelled . The body count seemed not to matter , or the amoral framing of the war . Rambo , for the dissenters , was a hero ? a kind of noble savage who got fed up with a system that reduces men to numbers and who took arms against it with wit , cunning and skill . Collective past : Yet Rocky and Rambo are figures of redemption as well after the antiheroics of the recent past , a trend in mass culture that reflected a nation 's fallen regard for itself . Our fantasy heroes are less mirrors of what we are than windows into what we might like to be . Rambo and Rocky are archetypes of our collective past , and if one was disfigured by it , the other is its champion ? the underdog who went for it and made good . " If I could unzip myself and step out and be somebody else , " Rocky 's brother-in-law , Paulie , tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd wan na be you . " So , by the evidence of his success , would a lot of us. 62 NEWSWEEK : DECEMBER 23 , 1985
