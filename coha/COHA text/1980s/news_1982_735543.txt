txt Despite assurances from Greece 's Socialist government that they are still welcome , more than 300 foreign companies with Middle Eastern and African operations are beginning to wonder if promises of hospitality will be kept . Legislative and bureaucratic changes in the past year are casting shadows on a 1967 law that encouraged foreign companies to use Greece as a base for business in other countries . In return for numerous privileges , including tax exemption and duty-free status , the companies were required to invest at least $50,000 of foreign currency and , until this year , post a bond of $5,000 . But now parts of the Greek bureaucracy are insisting that these offshore companies comply with a vast array of ordinary business regulations , even though they are obstensibly exempt under the special protective law . And the required bond has been increased to $50,000 , an amount considered high by business executives running some of the smaller administrative offices .

A survey by Commissioners International , a consulting firm , found that 26 of the companies bring less than $100,000 in foreign exchange annually , 13 bring in more than $1 million and the rest are somewhere in between . Estimates of the total foreign exchange attracted to Greece by the offshore offices range from $96 million to $250 million . The foreign companies are coming under pressure to contribute more . For example , MMM Design Group , an American concern that runs its Middle Eastern design and construction activities from Athens , is being asked by the Social Services Ministry to pay $500,000 for 10 years of back health and pension payments for its 130 employees . The ministry 's demand has been called " excessive " by Stavros Thomadakis , economic adviser to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou , although such benefit payments must be paid to employees in Common Market countries under the community 's rules .

' Eliminate Vagueness ' " There is a lack of a chain of authority concerning these matters , " says J. Roger McCaulay , a U.S. regional trade official in Athens . " The government must come up with regulations and eliminate all this vagueness . " Mr. Thomadakis , who has been meeting with representatives of the offshore companies , says the government wants them to stay in Greece . " We 'll welcome any company that is willing to play the game responsibly according to the rules , " he says . Nonetheless , some offshore companies are considering the possibility that they will be forced to move out of Greece , though their executives concede that their options are limited .
