THE COMPLEAT XMAS STORY By Brock Brower It is , let us assume , and pray , the day after the twelfth day of Christmas . Thirteen Santas snoring . Twelve ladies having danced , eleven lords having leaped , ten drummers having drummed their all . But the kids tell me yet another present has been found , while vacuuming up the dead pine needles , one that somehow got kicked under the sofa fender . Nine pipers having piped , eight maids having milked . Wrinkled red tissue paper , knotted white ribbon , no tag , only a sprig of dry holly , so they say it has to be for me . Seven swans having swum , six geese having laid . I feel through the thin tissue , flex grumbling pages , and guess what it is . Five golden rings , four colly birds , three French hens . My own notebook . Two turtle doves . Do Not Open Until Next Xmas when I will make one more vain attempt . And the partridge flown the pear tree . To complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I boast every December . But still unmastered . Somebody must 've wrapped this by mistake , after too many nogs , sans egg . I ease the tough ribbon round the notebook 's hard corner , tearing the Christmasy paper . I get one more crack out of the old binding , then begin to leaf through my faded inkings , like lines from some long-lost pen pal . Sketching out the gist of a season 's tale , still unseasonably delayed . Trouble is , I find , so many things you ca n't do anymore , in a Christmas story . You ca n't , for instance , do treacle . Characters in Christmas stories used to be treacle , as you and I are dust . Especially biblical characters , once removed  --  to old Xmas fireside tales  --  like Henry Van Dyke 's " The Other Wise Man , " whom thou wilt recognize as always speaking thusly . Even Frances Hodgson Bumett 's " Little Hunchback Zia " talks like that . Little Zia was cured of all his earthly ills on the night he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the newsletter Inside Book-selling and is currently wrung a book about the year 1956. manger , and the woman said , " Draw nigh , and let His hand rest upon thee ! " Only one day old , and already miracles  --  both the hump and the leprosy . You ca n't do Dickens either . Franklin D. Roosevelt used to read A Christmas Carol to the family at the White House every season . I at least had Ronald Colman as Scrooge on a scratchy old record . But how do you get anybody to listen now beyond " Bah ! Humbug ! " ? You ca n't do monetarist change of heart , squirearchical benevolence. " . . a string of hog's-puddings with a pack of cards to every poor family in the parish " ? that 's what Joseph Addison had Sir Roger de Coverlcy send around , long before even Dickens . But you ca n't cook the boar 's head , and gather the villagers for small beer , and follow Mr. Pickwick under the mistletoe at Dingley Dell . You ca n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an Xmas rewrite , is Marley . FROM : MARLEY , I. RE : XMAS TAKEOVER AT MARLEY &; SCROOGE This is dictated from inside a frozen door-knocker . Cramped , and very cold around the jowls , but I am ready and waiting to strike the fear of Christmas into Ebenezer Scrooge . I want you to check his calendar . The next three days . Tonight  --  has he got his 1 A.M. free ? I know about the bowl of gruel , but that can wait . I want to slip the Ghost of Christmas Past in there first . A little guy with a sprig of holly and a very shiny head , almost a dwarf , but he knows a lot of people Scrooge will have to know . Somebody named Fezziwig he once worked for , and this popsie he had a thing for . We 're playing on his guilt , so if he wants to know whose Past , tell him , right up front , his Past . And I do n't want a half-hour , I want an hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I A.M. , cross out the rest of his morning , write in the Ghost of Christmas Present . Present clearly has n't got a whole lot of time , so he ca n't come to us , we 'll have to go to him . A real ho-ho type , the original Jolly Green Giant , sits around on a pile of Christmas goodies , bare-chested , like he just knocked over a Pathmark . Subject for discussion with Present : Scrooge 's proposal to decrease the surplus population , along with the latest supply-side analysis of what , and where , that surplus really is . Since we 're going full-bore for sympathy on this , others attending the meeting : R. Cratchit , Mrs. Cratchit , two Misses Cratchit , Master P. Cratchit , two younger Cratchits , and T. T. Cratchit and crutch . If it flies  --  and well know from how Scrooge reacts to our Crutch **34;2775;TOOLONG Option  --  I want him to see the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come , tight away . Does n't have to he a real sit-down , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . All Yet to Come does is point . A futurist . You think he 's nothing but a sheet with one finger , but do n't underestimate him . He really knows where the bodies are buried . If Scrooge is still sticking with Option One ? " Keep Christmas in your own way , and let me keep it in mine " we 're counting on this guy to walk him right up to graveside , show him the bottom line . . Wait . No . Why drag it out ? Strike everything back to my opening graf . I want to reschedule . All three spirits here , now , tonight . Past will have to handle things until the other two can fly in . Call Present , tell him to meet the jet in Abu Dhabi . Wire Yet to Come to get on the Concorde . Well do it all in one night . Never know what hit him . When he wakes up tomorrow morning  --  with hold of nothing but the bedpost  --  I see him running for the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll throw open the shutters  --  and we 'll have a kid down in the street , all set to deal . We 'll offer him Christmas . He 'll be so glad he has n't missed it , he 'll grab it . " Like a golden parachute , " I have down here in my notes . Also : " When he leaves Marley Scrooge this Christmas Eve , change all the locks . " But it does n't sound right coming from somebody in fetters himself . Know what I mean ? Verisimilitude . You want character to rise out of circumstance , not Xmas excess . That 's how I created the only original Christmas character I 've come up with , to date . he circumstances were , I wanted the family to do something really old-fashioned . Make our own Christmas card . Carve one of those linoleum blocks , then roll red ink off a piece of window glass , and stamp the cards out on rice paper by leaning hard on the back of the block with both hands , or , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very simple card . Do n't want too many curlicues , or you lose the image in the ink stains . So my wife , the artist , sketched out this snowfall more an ice storm , really and then I added the shortest Xmas word I could think of , at the bottom of the block . NOEL . I carved all around each letter  --  N , 0 , E , then L  --  so they would he raised in red , not sunken in white . We let the kids do the inking , out in the kitchen , while we addressed envelopes . Let them stomp on them , with newspaper under the rice paper , and they were doing them up like Hallmark until Number One Son came in and asked , " Why are you sending them all to this one guy ? " " What guy ? " I said . " Leon . " " Who 's Leon ? " I said . " Are you messing up OUT there ? " " No way . It says ' Leon ' on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed out to the kitchen and , sure enough , all the imprints said " LEON , " raggedly backward , because I had forgotten to do the letters in reverse on the block L , E , 0 , then N  --  so they would print out " NOEL . " Instead , we had who knows how much personalized stationery for anybody answering to " Leon , " and I made haste , midst merry laughter , to place an order with UNICEF . But we kept Leon around , using the rice paper for place mars , and I started musing on him , in my notebook , and pretty soon he began to take seasonal shape . He was a tall , thin , blond Anglo who 'd grown up in the country with a Flexible Flyer . The family always cut their own pine boughs for over the mantel , but then moved to the city , where Leon ca n't tell grit from green through the terrible Yuletide . Every time he passes some street Santa , bell-ringing in front of some paper chimney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I also worked on Leon 's upside , tried to see if I could n't slip him into the Comp ! eat Xmas Story , maybe in an update of " The Gift of the Magi . " If you ca n't do Dickens , I had this theory , maybe you can still do 0 . Henry . If you recast. 0 . ' s version has Mr. James Dillingham Young and his pretty , young wife , Della . My version has a more modem couple . Leon goes in for Della . He is a househusband , living on Barrow down in the Village , struggling to sell his first romance novel , while his wife , Slim  --  in for Jim  --  works at a local television station and trains for the New York marathon . O.K. , it is the day before Christmas , Harlequin has just turned down Swords Under the Mistletoe , and Leon has $1.87 to his name . This is agony , because Leon knows Slim takes a lot of pride in the terrific Hong Kong chronometer that sits on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the studio and in the park , especially to time her runs  --  but the watchband is badly swear-stained , needs replacing . Only not for any $1.87 . But Leon happens to be a hunk , with this gorgeous head of blond curly hair , which he wears fairly long . So he goes around to Seventh , to this unisex hair stylist  --  you know the story  --  the stylist also does toupees , and for $65 , Leon sells his blond curls and buys a gold-filled , adjustable spandex to go around Slim 's wee wrist like a love knot . So far , so good . Everything is plausible , at least by 0 . I lenry standards , but what happens when Slim walks into the apartment in her jogging shoes arid velour sweatsuit , still sweaty from her workout , maybe even a little chilled , on Christmas Eve , and sees Leon standing there ? Way . I figure , she takes one long look and says , " You got a Mohawk ? " He shakes his shorn head . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Christmas ? " Already I can feel this story getting out of hand , even though Leon does his level best to plead his case ( " It 'll all grow back , in a month maybe " ) , tries desperately to smile as he hands her the gold-filled spandex in its free giftwrapped box , Merry Christmas . Slim undoes the package , sees what 's inside . Then sighs and slowly pulls up the velour cuff of her left sleeve . Now you can really see what trouble I 'm in with this story , because Slim obviously makes good money , very good money , local TV pays  --  even if Leon ca n't scrape it together  --  So why , what economic sense does it make fur her wrist to be suddenly bare ? Here , from my notebook , is the best I can offer : " Oh , baby , I 'm sorry . I was jogging around the reservoir , and this guy tails up on me. , he'sgot Yalie written all over him . Smiles boolaboola right at me , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all I feel is a funny little tug . He ripped me off . On Christmas Eve . And I do n't even know it for another quarter mile until I raise my arm to check my time . " You better believe 1 go after that Yalie bastard . I 'm yelling and screaming for a cop , but he 's too far ahead . I ca n't yell and scream and chase him too . He is in that great shape , he is like Donder and Blitzen , and I end up way over on the West Side , all I can find open is this Duane Reade . I could n't even get them to wrap anything . Oh , baby , look at you ... at least you did n't get it dyed green , or something .. . but you 're going to hate what I got you . . . " And she hands Leon a plain brown bag , out of which falls a $32.95 two-speed blow dryer . See what I mean by a few narrative problems ? I 've thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them more like the Walrons in that rural Xmas TV classic , " The Homecoming . " But Slim would crack up doing Patricia Neal alone in a Christmas blizzard . Better to work on Leon along the lines of John Boy  --  from the kid 1 know he must have been , always played one of the shepherds in his high school Christmas pageant , before the ACLU closed them all down . Stared himself half blind every Xmas at a blue spotlight that was the Angel From On High . hat 's why I keep trying to line up something solid for Leon , in the Complear Xmas Story . But going through my notebook again , this Thirteenth Night , I 'm thinking I might he taking the wrong approach . Maybe it ca n't even he a narrative anymore . No Dickens , no 0 . Henry , no Clement C. Moore  --  not even Dylan Thomas 's Child 's Christmas in Wales , or Truman Capote 's Creole rehash of same . No , it 's got to be more high concept  --  a real Yule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let 's say , to an Advent card . Yes , how about down in the lower left corner , could n't that be Leon ? His old shepherd self again , gazing up at all those little tab-shut paper windows . Only do n't pick them open , one at a time . Let them all fly open , the way they used to on Laugh-ln . Exactly . Everything whip-zipzap and random and rush-rush , like the Christmas chaos we all know so well . Some favorite Christmas character , any favorite Christmas character , pops up , does a spiel , a little dance , a one-liner , even a carol , then laying a finger alongside his nose  --  slammo ! ? up the chimney he goes  --  a soot shower , and blackout ! Start with a star suddenly appearing in the east , in very low orbit . " Telstar of Wonder , Telstar of Light . . . " Then  --  hear now , this  --  from the Three Wise Men . Gaspar : " Unto you is born a king . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . brings you this news update . " Balthasar : " A savior is born . That was the hark from the Herald Angel tonight to a crowded party of shepherds , keeping watch . Immediately after the hark , the shepherds left for an unnamed Bethlehem destination . " Gaspar : " Now hack to Nutcracker Madness . starring ? " Suddenly our most existential Xmas hero stag-leaps into view . The Nutcracker himself . He has great Twyla Tharp moves  --  crazy legs and jazzy , priapic sword thrusts  --  but his wooden jaw is bandaged shut with Clara 's scarf , the result of having been force-fed a nut too tough to crack by nasty little Fritz . He 's inarticulate , ca n't even wish you a Merry Christmas , but he 's got bigger priorities , anyhow . Namely , facing the Mouse King , who has seven heads and comes on like a section of A Chorus Line . ali set to chew large wood . But before the battle can be joined , several other figments of our collective Christmas imagination pop up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pan will put his entire Tribe of Lost Boys under Nutcracker 's command if Nutcracker will agree to assign Wendy work that is non-combat-related . Peter also brings word that Captain Hook has taken all his pirates over to the Mice . Meanwhile , Nutcracker is approached by none other than the Grinch . The very same who once tried to steal Christmas . The Grinch suggests this.and that dirty plan , but with Candyland clearly in mind for himself . When Nutcracker refuses to talk  --  he ca n't , anyway  --  the Grinch immediately goes over to the Mice with all the latest intelligence goodies on Candy-land . " You 're a sly one . Mr. Grinch . " In the end , Rudolph casts his Red Nose with the Nutcracker forces , but Gene Autry declares , " Ich bin ein mouse . " What all this is leading up to , of course , is war . A blare of trumpets , a crash of chimes , other martial Moog music . Nutcracker mounts up , launches a cross-parlor attack against the scurrying Mice  --  under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree  --  and we are into , yes , Christmas Star Wars . It is a battle pitched in fiercely mixed media . You can still spot jetes and plies from the old Kirov Ballet , hear Tchaikovsky distantly in digital , but at the heart of the fearsome fray all is lasers and Dolby sound . Nutcracker 's horses are quickly surrounded by brigades of foot Mice . Enhanced neighing and squealing . Fate hangs in the very balance . with Nutcracker chewed almost bootless , when a cry goes up from Peter , and into the tinsel and carnage flies a strange figure , firing like a gunship . Wendy may be out of action , but guess who is n't ? Tinkerbell . She is not only a terrific laser , but a great mouser . The tide turns . Mouse dead begin to pile up like fur balls as she whirls in , then lands like a chopper , right beside Nutcracker . Together , they charge the Mouse King himself , go for all seven heads . Victorious , Nutcracker raises his white standard o'er the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded , and alas , blinking mortally . O.K. , we all know what to do here . Clap . Clap like crazy . Only your applause can save Tinkerbell , right ? But that was childhood , this is Now . Far greater audience exposure , and every chance of a huge public outpciuring in response to Tinker-bell 's struggle for survival . Which we should try to maximize . Do a phone-in poll . How many are aware of Tinkerbell 's condition and want to help ! Bumper stickers . Honk If You Love Tinkerbell . And a jingle . " Tin-ker-bell . . " to the tune of " 0 Tannenbaum " ! Do a Tinkerbell telethon  --  show what a celebration there is going to be , up in Prince Nutcracker 's castle , if we save Tinkerbell . Even the snowflakes are going to waltz . And after the snowflakes , believe it or not , the flowers are going to waltz . In certain parts of the country , we even tie in with Pledge Week . But no loose ends . Keep the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have the Grinch hanging around , in some by-plot , angling to have his way with the Sugar Plum Fairy . Or Rudolph come suddenly tailgating out of the fog , on a crazy Christmas sleigh chase . Or any foul-up over just when Santa Claus is coming to town , or doubts about who 's been naughty and who 's been nice . If this is going to be the Story . Next Xmas . Almost Compleat . Noel , Leon . ?
