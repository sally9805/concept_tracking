 | Is marital fidelity possible in this age of sexual freedom ? It most certainly is ! Ecstasy and monogamy are not mutually exclusive . One man and one woman can stay happily married forever . Any marriage partner can avoid an affair . All one has to do is recognize that , given the vast amount of sexual stimuli with which our culture bombards us today , it is important not only to believe that fidelity is possible but to also have a strategy for remaining faithful to the one you love . Though sexual infidelity is one of the great enemies of a lasting relationship , statistics tell us that husbands and wives are turning with increasing frequency to new partners . The figures are startling . When several thousand men were asked if they 'd had extramarital affairs , about half said they had and two-thirds said they would consider an affair under certain circumstances . Statistics show that adultery is on the rise among women too . To some people these statistics merely confirm that monogamous love is unrealistic in our age of sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought to legitimatize adultery and who tried to say that a lot of good can come from a sexual fling . There are even many psychologists and marriage counselors who tell us that an occasional affair can be beneficial to a marriage . But despite these efforts to make husbands and wives  | regard fidelity as outmoded , our instinct to pair off with only one person has very deep roots in almost every society . Human beings form meaningful bonds with one another because we apparently function most happily in one-to-one relationships of commitment and trust . Hence the Bible 's clear-cut proscriptions against extramarital sex , and the history of church support for monogamous marriage . The Scriptures take an unequivocal position : It is always a sin to commit adultery . With such a rigid rule , it is easy for some people to wonder if God decided to give us such commandments simply in order to make us miserable or test our allegiance to Him . But in fact , God gives us such rules not to make us miserable , but to make us happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position to give us our operating instructions . And the One who made us says that we will function best when we pledge ourselves to a mate and remain faithful to the one we have chosen . One of the popular canards abroad today is that a person can have a moderate amount of outside sex without harming one 's marriage . Just be sure you keep it casual and be sure that you and your mate have an " honest understanding , " the proponents say . Most of the people who come to me for help did not intend to break up their marriages when they reached for a little flirtation and sexual excitement . But all too often , from what I have seen , affairs do break up good , functional marriages ? damaging children , breaking dreams . and causing permanent damage to persons who did nothing to invite injury . Why do we stray ? In looking at the complex reasons that we are tempted to stray , we must first dispel two misconceptions about the phenomenon of extramarital affairs . There is. first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love for only one person at a time and that if you feel that you are falling in love with someone new , you must have fallen out of love with your mate . That is nonsense . The other canard one often hears is : " A person never would have strayed unless there was something wrong with the marriage . " Wrong again . Surveys show that many unfaithful spouses rate their  | overall marital relationship as " good " or " very good . " What is it , then , that those who are unfaithful want ? If the marriage is happy and the sex is fine , why would one partner go to the trouble ( and usually it is trouble ) of having an affair ? Animal desire is one reason . One of the curious contradictions we carry with us is that while we have a mental instinct to be monogamous , biologically we are capable of being attracted to almost anyone of the opposite sex . Another reason is that there are periods in one 's life , usually when one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of circumstance increase the vulnerability to an extramarital fling . If those stress points happen to occur at a time when the marriage is not going well , the danger is intensified . Another factor that makes it a little more difficult to be true to one mate for a lifetime is that we are all somewhat fascinated with the forbidden . The last , and perhaps the most common , cause for having an affair is boredom . It is my thesis that the allure of the affair lies not so much in the nature of romance as in the nature of boredom . No long-standing relationship can compete in excitement with a brand-new affair with an attractive , interesting person . Knowing this , there are specific things one can do to control wandering erotic feelings or to repair the breach if a mistake has already occurred . Here are some suggestions : 1 ) Decide what you believe . The sooner you can make up your mind what you really believe about sexual commitment , the better it will be , because in the long run , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than on your feelings . The Bible tells us that adultery is wrong and that we are to be true to the mate we have chosen . If you do not accept that , your behavior will be the natural consequence of your decision about monogamy . The persons to be pitied most are the ones who are uncertain about what kind of sexual life they have chosen , and who wait to adapt their behavior to whatever opportunities come along . These are the persons who wake up too late to the realization that they have jeopardized their family life without thinking through the consequences . 2 ) Decide whether you are bored with your mate or with yourself . If many affairs begin out of boredom , it is important to determine whether your mate has really become uninteresting or whether your real problem is that you are bored with yourself and with your life in general . If the answer is the latter , it is important to get busy making some changes . Almost any change . If your basic boredom is with life itself , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For long-range solutions , self-change may be necessary . 3 ) Regulate your fantasy life . People were shocked some years ago when a famous religious figure was caught in a sexual scandal . Someone who knew him well , however , was not at all surprised that it happened . " I saw what he read , " the man told me . " It was inevitable that he would eventually act out those fantasies . " In other words , if you fill your mind with trashy novels , pornography , and accounts of life that are contrary to your beliefs , sooner or later your morals will be broken down by that constant bombardment . None of us can withstand an unlimited exposure to such material without having it eventually seep into our moral thinking . 4 ) Learn your limits . There are those who say that one should restrict friends to people of the same sex in order to eliminate the possibility of sexual attraction . But for a man to eliminate women from his circle of friends would impoverish his life and his marriage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand and love my wife , Diane , better . But Diane and I have an agreement : We are free to make friends with anyone we want , but we both know our sexual limits ; if we think we are beginning to test those limits , we bail out in a hurry . No friendship is as important as our marriage . 5 ) Remember : Little decisions are the important ones . A successful businessman who started from scratch to become co-owner of a company that grosses more than two billion dollars a year told me , " For me , the key was not making the big decisions , but the little ones . Those little decisions are crucial , and added up , they make the difference between failure and success . " This valuable principle works for success in relationships as well as in business . I mean , the real test is not the question , " Shall I have an affair ? " because by the time you 're at that point , it 's probably already too late . The crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as , " Shall I pick up the phone and call ? " or " Would it hurt if I sent just this one postcard ? " These are the little but crucial intersections at which your destiny is determined . The way to win the battle against infidelity is to win the little skirmishes one at a time . 6 ) Remember that sex is not everything . Surprising as it may be , there are some people who , apparently happily . have gone without sexual intercourse for several years . I am not recommending this as a way of life but relating it as a way of saying that sex is not all there is . Other emotions , such as kindness , can sometimes cause almost as much joy . I know a woman whose husband had surgery almost a decade ago that incapacitated him for customary sexual intercourse . Afterwards he rehearsed a little speech to make to his wife about how he would understand if she decided to get a divorce . But before he could even get started , she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , you 'll have to think up a lot better excuse than this one . " Then she told him she 'd rather live her life with half of him than with all of any other man . They are still together and , as nearly as I can tell , she is a fulfilled woman . Does jealousy help or hinder a marriage ? Today it is regarded as poor form to express jealousy . If you are the jealous type , it is by all means advisable to examine your feelings to see if they are too extreme . The wife who rages every time her husband looks at a pretty girl is not helping their relationship . She should examine the reason for her feelings . It may be an attempt to keep her husband on a very tight leash , which will probably backfire , or it may be that she feels very insecure and is really asking for more love from her husband . A woman has a perfect right to ask for more affection if she needs it , but angling for it indirectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start a fight . Having said that , I must now say that jealousy in moderate amounts is a sign of love . I say that despite the fact that these days we are told that the way to hang on to a mate is to stay cool and act as if we do n't care whether or not our partner falls for someone else . I do n't believe that . Indifference never aroused love in any one . Diane and I were once watching a TV program about straying husbands . Wives were being interviewed about what they would do if they learned that  | their husbands were philandering . My ordinarily easygoing wife turned to me and said , " I know what I 'd do ? I 'd fight for you ! " I do not plan to test her on that , but I was flattered to the core that she loves me so much . Every man I know feels the same way . So to the extent that jealousy is an expression of love , it may not be all bad . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can do to ensure against infidelity . Here are a few suggestions : 1 ) Step up your marital sex life . A fascinating pattern emerges when a wife III learns that her husband is seeing another woman . There are usually tears , lots of anger and hostility , of course , but along with that , in 99 percent of the hundreds of cases I have worked with , there is an increase in the couple 's sex life . The point is : If a wife increases sexual interaction in order to get her mate back if he is straying , why not do it in order to prevent an affair ? 2 ) Talk to your mate about how you would feel if he were unfaithful . The possibility of an affair is on everyone 's mind , yet it is a topic that few couples ? even close couples ? ever discuss with each other . If it is important to you that your partner try to be true , then say so . Do not say : " If you ever mess around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is an invitation to your partner to try to get away with something and gives the impression that infidelity might be okay so long as it 's kept quiet . Make clear that you would be very , very hurt if he were unfaithful. 3 ) Make your own commitment clear . It does n't hurt to tell your spouse that you have had some opportunities to be unfaithful and that you 've been true , if in fact that has been the case . Some couples have been married so long that they assume their mate knows that they are being faithful , and that sexual commitment is still important . But too many assumptions are always dangerous . Successfully married couples continue to feed each other with data about their feelings ? which ones have changed , which have not . 4 ) Avoid prolonged absences . Many adolescent love affairs end when one party goes away to college and the other stays home . Two-career families , with a husband working in Seattle and a wife in Denver , are playing with dynamite . It is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's feelings for the beloved more intense . " I miss you desperately , " Diane will write to me when I 'm off speaking at some convention . Our pattern of talking things over each evening and of living a shared life has been interrupted and it poignantly makes me realize what I 'm missing when we 're apart . But I would n't dare stay away from her for , say , six weeks . She might get accustomed to living without me ! 5 ) Use positive reinforcement . An occasional compliment and a thank-you once in a while will do more to modify your mate 's behavior than any amount of threats or jealous nagging . If you are married to an attractive person who is pretty sure to get some come-ons from people at work , let it be known that you know that . Explain how much it means to you to be married to a lover who is true . Many of us are blessed with wives or husbands who have high standards and who love us enough to suppress some very strong inclinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our appreciation to them for resisting those opportunities ? 6 ) Trust your mate . It is a principle in marriage counseling that the surest way to send a mate into the arms of another lover is to be accusing him constantly of having an affair . If you are uneasy , insecure , suspicious , and constantly questioning , you may think you are helping to hold your mate in line , but usually it has the opposite effect . No one likes to be distrusted , and such accusations tend to bring out the worst in us . On the other hand . when we are trusted , that tends to bring out our best . It is a great gift if a wife believes in her husband , knows that he is a good person , and does not constantly question h. - about all his movements . And when a wife puts that sort of confidence in her mate , he will usually do everything in his power to live up to the image . " Call a dog by a good name , " an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can to live up to that reputation . " If one should slip : Learning that a mate is having an affair is a devastating experience , and I am always profoundly touched by the pain such knowledge causes . With the high incidence of extramarital sex , however , many persons may have to face the fact that their partner has slipped . Here are some suggestions for dealing with this : 1 ) Remember that it 's not the end of the world . It 's probably not even the end of your marriage unless you want it to be . The worst thing about discovering that your mate has been unfaithful is that you feel rejected and uncared for . 2 ) In fact , however , your partner may still be deeply in love with you and the affair may have had little or no meaning . I know it is difficult to believe that an unfaithful husband acted without feeling or that your marriage is not in jeopardy as a result of the infidelity . We tend to think the worst . But here is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or therapist that they could have a temporary fling without loving their mate any less and without wanting to end their marriage . But they find it hard to give their partner the same benefit of the doubt . 3 ) Do not stifle your emotions . If you learn your mate has had an affair , you are going to be hurt , and if you need to cry , for goodness ' sake , cry . Women who come to see me when they 've just learned of their husbands ' affairs say , Now , ci nacho Nacho crunch of Trisc snack 5  | " I 've got to get hold of myself . If I keep crying this way I know I 'm going to drive him away . Not so . If you hurt , express it . 3 ) Assess your mate 's responsibility . Among women responding to a survey on whether they would leave their husbands if they discovered they were having an affair , the overwhelming majority said it would " depend " and that they would try to find out why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last response is wise , because husbands ' reasons for straying can differ enormously . For instance , it may make a difference whether your mate actively sought the affair or was , in fact , seduced . We have all known of situations where a good person is the object of a carefully planned campaign : if the onslaught happens to coincide with a vulnerable moment , there are few of us who can be sure that we would not succumb . If you know that was the circumstance , it hopefully will ease your anger and feeling of rejection . 4 ) Try to assess your own responsibility . Most people ? certainly those who have any humility ? who come to me for help when their mate has had an affair say , " I 've got to take part of the blame . I was making a lot of mistakes . " Knowing this , it makes sense to become aware of these " mistakes " and talk them over with your mate before anything happens . By doing so , a potentially dangerous event can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer together . 5 ) Do n't ask about the details . Some people , when wronged , have a macabre impulse to want to learn about every minute aspect of the wrongdoing . To make your partner recount all the details of an affair keeps him or her in an inferior position ; to ask anyone to watch you go through the hurt again is severe punishment indeed . 6 ) Do not try to retaliate in kind . The natural instinct when you are hurt is to give your mate some of the same medicine ? namely have an affair yourself . Sometimes this is not revenge but a desperate need to prove to yourself or to your partner that you are still desirable . While this instinct is understandable , if it is followed , the results are often disastrous . I think more divorces have occurred when a second partner has a retaliatory affair than when the initial slip occurred . An already shaky situation can be destroyed by such an impulse . Finally , to sum up , I know of literally hundreds of wonderful marriages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past and today the " wronged " partner is very glad that he or she did not panic unnecessarily . A slip is not necessarily the end of the world . Even if you lose a round in today 's highly competitive game of love and sex , it should not be the end of your self-esteem and it need not be the end of your marriage .
