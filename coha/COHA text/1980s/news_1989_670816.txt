The first phase of economic union , which takes effect on July 1 , 1990 , would require an end to exchange controls and obstacles to European-wide banking , securities and insurance services . The final two phases would involve the adoption of a common currency and the creation of a regional central bank. // Mrs. Thatcher found herself in the position , unusual for her , of having made the crucial compromise that allowed a European meeting to end successfully . She retreated to do battle another day against the idea of a Eurocurrency that would replace the pound , the franc , the mark and other currencies. // // Second and Third Phases // Mrs. Thatcher ' s compromise was to agree to a European commitment to let preparations go ahead for an inter-governmental conference on the second and third phases of European monetary union , after the first phase begins in 1990 . The conference would discuss modifications of the Common Market ' s 1957 charter , the Treaty of Rome , which would have to be changed to permit full economic union. // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summit ' s final communique was that the conference would have to be " preceded by full and adequate preparation. " // " This will not stop a conference from being called , " Mrs. Thatcher said at a news conference today , acknowledging that Britain would be in the minority in opposing it if the other nations go ahead. // " I think there ' s no need for a single currency in Europe , " she said . " It ' ll be the biggest transfer of national sovereignty we ' ve ever had , and I don ' t think it will be at all acceptable to the British Parliament . " <> <> Plan for the Pound // Mrs. Thatcher also came closer than ever before to explaining when the time would be right for Britain to let the pound join the European Monetary System , as her Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer have sought. // The monetary system links the currencies of nine European nations and sets limits on exchange rates among them . With Spain ' s recent inclusion in the system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece and Portugal. // Mrs. Thatcher said that when the first phase was complete and a single European market had been achieved , and if Britain could get its 8. 3 percent inflation rate down substantially , the pound could join the monetary system. // Several European participants said Mrs. Thatcher had been uncharacteristically moderate in explaining her objections to a European currency this time around . They wondered whether her party ' s defeat in the June 15 elections to the European Parliament had anything to do with her demure tone. // What Mrs. Thatcher would do was the main question at the two-day meeting , which could have ended in failure if she had remained opposed . President Francois Mitterrand of France , her most outspoken debating opponent , said today , " The United Kingdom refuses all surrender of sovereignty in economic and political affairs. " // West Germany ' s Foreign Minister , Hans-Dietrich Genscher , said at a news conference that a simple majority of the European countries could call the inter-governmental conference to lay the groundwork for a common currency . But Mrs. Thatcher observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heads of the 12 governments. // Despite the prospect of further clashes over the issue , Mr. Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany both said they were very pleased by the outcome . " I presume the United Kingdom doesn ' t want to be isolated - no one wants to be left behind , " Mr. Mitterrand said . Earlier today , in a radio interview , he had described Mrs. Thatcher as a " brake " on European unity. // " He ' s scarcely got into the car yet , " retorted the Prime Minister , who said that unlike Britain , France had not yet abolished foreign exchange controls or eliminated restrictions on capital movements. // Mr. Mitterrand , who was unable today to get the other leaders to set a deadline of December 1992 for laying the groundwork for a common European currency , said afterward that he would call for the intergovernmental conference to start the preparations for it on the earliest date he could , July 1 , 1990 , when the first phase starts . <> <> Loose Confederation Sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the years has been aimed partly at shaping Europe as a loose confederation of sovereign states rather than as a tight union . This was the same stance Charles de Gaulle took three decades ago as president of France . It has also been good theater : Mrs. Thatcher ' s news conference and her assistants ' earlier briefings were all sellout performances. // Her tactical retreat on the currency question concealed her success in preventing the meeting from adopting outright the three-stage blueprint for achieving economic and monetary union . That plan was submitted to the government heads by Jacques Delors , the president of the European Communty ' s executive commission. // Mrs. Thatcher argued that this was only one possible way to greater economic unity among others , and the final communique said realizing the goal would have to " allow for the diversity of specific situations. " // Asked what other ways she saw of achieving European economic union , Mrs. Thatcher spoke of voluntary coordination among the member states. // " I wait with interest for other alternatives , " Mr. Delors said today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in the community is more ideological than the left. " // Mrs. Thatcher also dissented from approval of a draft European charter of social rights adopted by the 11 other countries , though Mr. Kohl said that he hoped work would continue on it in time to have something signed at the next European meeting in France at the end of the year. //
