The 12,000 organ transplants performed in the U.S. each year are often successful only because the patients take a daily dose of cyclosporine . The drug keeps their immune systems from attacking and rejecting the foreign organs . But it is not perfect . Some 70% of patients getting a new liver , for example , still suffer rejection episodes . And many organ recipients face life- threatening side effects from cyclosporine , including an increased risk of cancer and heart disease . <P> Now a respected researcher who was one of the first to use cyclosporine may have found a better way to make transplants succeed . Dr. Thomas Starzl of the University of Pittsburgh , the world 's largest transplant center , is expected to report in the British journal Lancet this week that a new drug , FK-506 , is proving to be more powerful and less toxic than cyclosporine . In more than 100 patients taking FK-506 for up to eight months , the rate of organ rejection was only one-sixth as high as in those using cyclosporine . Side effects were minimal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration calls the preliminary research " very exciting , " but approval for general use may be years away . <P> FK-506 works by suppressing the proliferation of certain white blood cells , the workhorses of the immune system . Starzl thinks the drug could signal a revolution in organ transplantation . Moreover , it could possibly lead to a treatment for diseases , like arthritis , that are caused by an overactive immune system . <P> Manufactured by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical of Osaka , FK-506 is derived from a soil fungus found in Japan . Starzl first learned of the drug in 1986 at a meeting in Helsinki . Other researchers had dismissed it because in studies using dogs it caused severe bleeding and other problems . But Starzl believed the reaction occurred in dogs alone and undertook a graduated series of experiments on several other animals , from rats to baboons . These tests were encouraging , and in February 1989 Starzl tried the drug on Robin Ford , a 26- year-old secretary who was in danger of rejecting her third liver . After two weeks of FK-506 treatments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible how great this drug is . " <P> But FK-506 will not remove the most serious hurdle to transplants : the chronic shortage of donor organs . More than 18,000 Americans in need of transplants are waiting for organs to become available .
