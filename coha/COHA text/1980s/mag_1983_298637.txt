The army gives up on Rios Monti 's born-again leadership <P> His downfall surprised no one except perhaps himself . Rumors of plots to oust him had circulated so often during the 16-month rule of Guatemalan President Efrain Rios Montt that observers lost count of the actual attempts . Had there been seven ? Eight ? Ten ? Whatever the tally , last week 's coup turned out to be for keeps . After a brief gun duel outside the National Palace in Guatemala City , the country 's military leaders toppled Rios Montt and replaced him with Defense Minister Oscar Humberto Meja Victores . <P> The change , at least initially , is likely to be more of style than substance . A born-again Christian and onetime Sunday-school teacher , Rios Montt , 56 , had displayed a penchant for proselytizing his Roman Catholic country of 7.9 million . In Meja , 52 , the nation has a no-nonsense paratrooper and a Roman Catholic who is not likely to mix politics and evangelism . Though the Reagan Administration had supported Rios Montt 's reforms , Washington withheld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope Meja will continue the same programs . " <P> When Rios Montt joined the coup that overthrew the government of General Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia in March 1982 , he made for a refreshing change . Rios Montt reduced corruption and abolished many of the government-sanctioned death squads that had haunted the country . Though his tactics cost the lives of thousands of innocent Guatemalans , the new leader succeeded in subduing a threat by 4,000 leftist guerrillas last year . <P> Rios Montt made his first serious mistake only three months after he came to power , when he tossed out his two junta partners and declared himself President . He imposed a 10% sales tax that angered the country 's businessmen . Wealthy landowners believed , mistakenly as it turned out , that the government planned to launch a land-reform program . Veteran military leaders resented Rios Montt 's reliance on younger officers . <P> But Rios Montt 's cardinal sin was being aggressively Protestant in a Catholic country . A member of a California-based sect called the Christian Church of the Word , he appointed two church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petty : when Pope John Paul II toured the country last March , Rios Montt refused to provide government funds for a specially built car for the Pontiff . <P> Until June , the occasional coup attempt originated with two fringe groups : friends of the deposed Lucas Garcia or supporters of the right-wing politician Leonel Sisniega Otero . On June 28 , however , senior military commanders met with Rios Montt and demanded that he fire his religious aides , disband an advisory group of young officers and set a date for early elections . The President pacified them by agreeing to fire the junior officers , but the effect was fleeting . <P> On Aug. 6 , virtually all of the commanders of the country 's armed forces gathered at the Guatemala City barracks of the Guardia de Honor , an elite army garrison . There were impassioned arguments for and against ousting Rios Montt , but gradually the plotters won . The decisive factor : the news that Sisniega Otero was once again planning to move against Rios Montt . Explains a Guatemalan journalist : " The ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
