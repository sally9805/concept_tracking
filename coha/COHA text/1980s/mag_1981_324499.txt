U.S. officials launch an offensive over El Salvador <P> " The insurgency in El Salvador has I been transformed into a textbook case of indirect armed aggression by Communist powers . " With that stark assertion , the Reagan Administration last week launched a carefully orchestrated campaign to demonstrate that the Soviet Union , Cuba , Viet Nam and other Communist nations have been smuggling arms to the leftist guerrillas in El Salvador . The Administration 's motive is to win support for increased U.S. military aid to that strife-torn nation , and the intensity of the effort is stunning . <P> A U.S. delegation headed by Lawrence Eagleburger , Reagan 's choice as Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs , visited five European capitals with fresh evidence of Soviet-bloc mischief . Another team of U.S. envoys , headed by Lieut . General Vernon Walters , set out for Latin America . Secretary of State Alexander Haig headed for Capitol Hill to brief congressional leaders . The State Department provided embassies of friendly governments in Washington with a lengthy memorandum detailing its evidence . This week the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " white paper " summarizing its case that , as one State Department official put it , " El Salvador is an East-West conflict . " <P> In what proved to be one of the most complex intelligence assessments conducted since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis , officials at the State Department , the Central Intelligence Agency , and the Defense Intelligence Agency worked feverishly for more than two weeks assembling the evidence . Many of the details were provided by a clearly prejudiced party-the Salvadoran armed forces-and had to be double-checked . U.S. officials then had to tailor a presentation for foreign officials that would not compromise intelligence sources in Central America . <P> In the most dramatic briefings of the week , Eagleburger offered his European listeners a chronological summary of Soviet-bloc efforts to arm the rebels . He described how , over the past two months , Soviet-built transport planes have been flying from Cuba to Managua , Nicaragua , and unloading a variety of American-and European-made arms , which are eventually smuggled into El Salvador . He backed up his assertions with a slide show that included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and detailing commitments made by Viet Nam , Ethiopia , the Soviet Union and East European nations to provide military hardware . Perhaps the most dramatic evidence was a series of photographs of a tractor-trailer said to have been captured in Honduras . Underneath the trailer 's false bottom was a cache of about 150 M-16 assault rifles . Serial numbers on U.S. weapons recovered from the guerrillas have been traced to the arsenal left behind by U.S. forces in Viet Nam . <P> West European officials were somewhat surprised that , as one top British diplomat put it , " the first business of the U.S. with its European allies should turn out to be El Salvador . " Yet they seemed uniformly impressed by the evidence and grateful to the Reagan Administration for consulting with them . " We are now inclined to believe that arms of a certain precise origin are being used with the aim of destabilizing El Salvador , " admitted a French official last week .                    @
