txt  | efficiently from these water-miscible forms . Fat is not involved in the absorption process . So , greater care in controlling dosage is necessary in order to avoid unwanted effects . Vitamin D is also synthesized cutaneously , by actinic conversion ( utilizing ultraviolet light ) , from its common endogenous precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol . The amount available from this source is highly variable and probably indeterminate because it depends on climate , level of dust and smoke pollution , level of skin pigmentation , duration and area of skin exposed , and whether or not a topical sunscreen is applied to the skin . For the most part , current lifestyles do not favor actinic conversion . So , a dietary source is now considered necessary for adults as well as children . Once produced , the vitamin D diffuses into the lymphatic system where it is indistinguishable from that obtained exogenously . Via the lymphatic system it is transported to the liver for processing . A second mechanism also exists for absorption of vitamin K. About 50% of the vitamin K absorbed is produced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they die . Bile salts are used to emulsify lipids in the small intestine . These are liberated when the lipids are absorbed , and as they remain in the chyme , they are carried along to the colon where they emulsify the newly liberated vitamin K. They carry the vitamin K across the mucosal wall when they are reabsorbed . Metabolism of Fat-soluble Vitamins ? in General At the liver , the chylomicrons are removed from circulation and are processed , starting with release of the fats and fat-soluble vitamins . The details of liver cell processing are not clearly understood . Vitamin A esters are hydrolyzed and recombined with a specific protein for transport . During vitamin A processing , some vitamin E is utilized as an oxygen scavenger ( it preferentially combines with the oxygen ) to prevent unwanted destructive oxidation . In any case , IF the circulating level of any one of the fat-soluble vitamins is low , THEN it is packaged as a low density ( LDL ) , very low density ( VLDL ) , or particularly as a high density ( HDL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of use . IF the circulating level of any one of the fat-soluble vitamins is within normal range , THEN it is converted to a storage form ( process unknown ) and is stored locally . Metabolism of Fat-soluble Vitamins ? in Specific Organs/Tissues Although the site for concentrated storage of the fat-soluble vitamins is the liver , storage in low concentration is distributed throughout the  | adipose cells of the body . In the aggregate , the dispersed storage potential is almost unlimited . Therefore , in adults supply is seldom a problem . Infants and children , however , are vulnerable to supply problems until liver and adipose reserves are developed . Usually , the circulating level is maintained within normal range and cells can withdraw on demand . Utilization of the vitamins by specific organs/tissues will be discussed in turn . Vitamin A. ? Recent research in animals , as yet unconfirmed in humans , suggests that Zn is essential in mobilization of vitamin A from liver stores . Smith et al . ( 1973 ) have reported the following : ( a ) Circulating plasma vitamin A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IF a deficient animal is given vitamin A , THEN it will be stored in the liver . ( c ) IF an animal deficient in both vitamin A and Zn is given both , THEN liver stores will not develop but the circulating level of vitamin A will rise . ( d ) IF an animal deficient in both vitamin A and Zn is given only vitamin A , THEN the circulating vitamin A level will remain low AND IF the vitamin A is discontinued and Zn is given , THEN liver vitamin A stores will decrease and the circulating level of vitamin A will increase . Clearly , this relationship requires further investigation . The mechanism of Zn involvement in the mobilization of vitamin A is unknown . It may be involved in either the synthesis or function of retinol-binding protein ; this is under investigation . A recent review ( Rodriquez and Irwin 1972 ) concluded that little information about vitamin A requirements at various stages of the life cycle is available . For example , various investigators have deduced infant requirements from their findings . The values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies of the needs of adolescents have been reported , and only a few studies of the needs of the elderly have been located . The review did outline the factors affecting the amount of vitamin A to be ingested . These are : ( a ) activity of the compound ( b ) amount of dietary protein present ( c ) frequency and duration of exercise ? need increases with physical activity ( d ) exposure to sunlight ? conflicting reports on effect ( e ) environmental temperature ? there are seasonal differences in need according to need for dark adaptability of vision ( f ) thyroid activity ? there is a positive correlation between the circulating level of vitamin A and the circulating level of thyroxine  | ( g ) infection ? the relationship is unclear , but an infection seems to decrease the circulating level The transmission of the visual impulse , especially in dim light , requires a continuous supply of vitamin A. Retinol is released from retinol-binding protein and is converted to retinaldehyde . Retinaldehyde , in the cis form , complexes with opsin to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retinol in the trans form . This cis-trans shift results in transmission of the impulse that causes the psycho-physical translation that we call vision . After the impulse has been transmitted , the trans form reverts to the cis form , but there is a short lag time . IF the supply of cis retinaldehyde is adequate , THEN every stimulus will generate an impulse and it will be transmitted . The nutriment role of vitamin A in epithelial tissues is as a constituent of the mucopolysaccharides and mucoproteins of mucus . Although some details are unclear , when the supply of vitamin A is adequate , mucussecreting cells are formed at the normal level and secretion of mucus is adequate to protect the tissues . Mucus forms a slick dense physical barrier that protects the tissue from invasion by bacteria . They can not penetrate . It is in this sense that vitamin A protects against infection . Vitamin A is necessary for normal development of bones and teeth . It is a necessary constituent of mucopolysaccharides of ground substances . And , it is necessary in the step where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base on which the **26;831;TOOLONG apatite salts are deposited . Without the normal base , the shape can not be controlled . The adrenal cortex withdraws vitamin A for production of the steroid hormones . Growth and reproduction depend on the circulating level of these hormones . Vitamin A is involved in the synthesis of corticosterone , deoxycorticosterone , and progesterone . Spermatogenesis requires that retinol be converted to retinaldehyde . Alcohol dehydrogenase , the enzyme involved in this conversion , is the one necessary for metabolism of ethanol . Since ethanol is preferentially metabolized , this conversion is inhibited . Hence , some investigators have proposed that alcoholic impotence results from this interference with vitamin A metabolism . Vitamin D. ? Recent research has revealed that prior to utilization in its nutriment function , vitamin D undergoes a two-step transformation . The first step takes place in liver cells where it is converted to **25;859;TOOLONG ( 25-HCC ) , which is its active form . Then , the second step takes place in the kidney where 25-HCC is converted to **29;886;TOOLONG ( 1,25-DHCC ) , which is its hormonal form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for translocation to its sites of use .  | The new theoretical explanation offered by DeLuca ( 1976 ) for the int eraction of vitamin D and calcium and phosphate is as follows : ( a ) IF vitamin D is adequate , THEN the 1-hydroxylase , i.e. , the enzyme that adds OH at position 1 , is sensitive to the circulating Ca++ and phosphate levels . ( b ) IF vitamin D is adequate , AND the circulating Ca " and/or phosphate level is normal , THEN production of 1,25-DHCC ( in renal tissues ) and 24,25-DHCC ( in renal and other tissues ) is stimulated . ( c ) IF vitamin D is adequate AND dietary Ca ' and/or phosphate intake is low AND the circulating level of Ca " and/or phosphate is low , THEN parathyroid hormone is secreted which stimulates production of 1,25-DHCC and suppresses production of 24,25-DHCC. ( d ) IF vitamin D is adequate AND dietary intake and the circulating level of Ca++ are high , THEN the 1-hydroxylase is inhibited , so production of 1,25-DHCC is suppressed and 24,25-DHCC is produced . Explanations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorption and mineralization of bone have been revised ( Fig. 11.1 ) . Partial explanations of the processes can be summarized as follows : ( a ) In the intestinal mucosa , vitamin D facilitates absorption in the initial phase before calcium binding protein ( CABP ) becomes available . And , IF 1,25-DHCC is circulating , THEN additional Ca " will be absorbed because the presence of this hormone induces production of CaBP ( Anon. 1978 ) . This protein is involved in the active transport of Ca " and phosphate ions because it makes the mucosal wall permeable to them . Note : parathyroid hormone is not involved in intestinal transport of Ca " and phosphate . Since 24,25-DHCC is inactive , IF it has been formed , THEN Ca " and/or phosphate uptake will be reduced . ( b ) In bones , IF 1,25-DHCC is present , THEN the action of the osteolytic cells is increased and resorption occurs . Ca " , inorganic phosphate , etc. , are liberated and released into systemic circulation . At the same time , IF 1,25-DHCC is present , THEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , phosphate , etc. , are deposited . The balance between these two processes allows adjustment of the circulating Ca ' and phosphate levels . Vitamin E. ? The nutriment role of vitamin E is as an oxygen scavenger , i.e. , it preferentially combines with available oxygen , preventing destructive oxidations . This function has long been known in relation to plant tissue lipids . Recently , it has been observed in animal tissues , e.g. , intestinal mucosa , adipose tissue , and skeletal muscle tissue . Vitamin E appears to work in conjunction with the selenium-glutathione ( Se-GSH ) peroxidase system in performing its role .  | The human requirement for vitamin E largely depends on PUFA intake . A recent study by Lehmann et al . ( 1977 ) found that the natural vitamin E content of a mixed diet with 25% calories as fat was 0.17 to 1.18 mcg/g PUFA . The natural vitamin E content of a mixed diet with 35% calories as fat was 0.31 to 0.93 mcg/g PUFA . A level of 0.6 mcg/g // mg/100 ml total tocopherol as the difference criterion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat-calories intake was borderline to deficient p 185 for one-third of the subjects ; the 35% fat-calories intake was adequate . Sex differences in relationships between circulating levels of vitamin E and lipid fractions also were found . For women , there was a high correlation between total cholesterol level and a-tocopherol level . For men , there was a high correlation between TG level and a-tocopherol level . These sex differences need to be taken into account in assessment of vitamin E nutriture . As a result of these findings , i.e. , that the 25% fat-calorie diets provided 12 IU and 15 IU of vitamin E to women and men , respectively , and that the 35% fat-calorie diets provided 21 IU and 26 IU of vitamin E to women and men , respectively , the adequacy of the current RDA of 8 to 10 mg has been questioned . In the intestinal mucosa , free oxygen is occluded in the foods and has not yet diffused from the food across the mucosal wall to the systemic circulation . As a result , it can oxidize some nutrients , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen scavenger , it indirectly protects these nutrients . Vitamin A is particularly vulnerable on liberation from food fat esters . All other things being equal , vitamin A absorption is related to effectiveness of vitamin E protection . In the process , vitamin E is used up , so the amount absorbed is reduced . In adipose cells , the role of vitamin E is similar but the process is more complex , involving stabilization of PUFA . IF a person consumes a diet high in PUFA , THEN stored TG in adipose cells will be partially composed of PUFA . PUFA are not very stable . The unsaturated bonds are easily broken , resulting in the formation of free radicals . We are continually subjected to radiation , which breaks the unsaturated bonds . The free radicals formed are of random size . They are rapidly moving fragments and they bombard the structures of the adipose cells ( others as well ) , damaging them . When damage is great enough , cell function is interfered with to such an extent that cell death ensues . The cumulative and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oxygen scavenger , protects cell life by combining with available oxygen , making it unavailable for combination with PUFA . This breaks the chain reaction by which the free radicals are formed , and so prevents aging in this sense . THEREFORE , IF a diet high in PUFA is customarily consumed , THEN there is a need for vitamin E. The role of vitamin E in muscles is to protect the integrity of the stored triglycerides , which are a reserve energy source . Normally , glycogen is stored for immediate energy . IF a person is well-nourished calorically , in addition to adipose tissue stores of lipid , THEN intramuscular deposits of lipids will develop , e.g. , the meat of obese animals is well-marbled . IF the diet has been rich in PUFA , THEN the stored triacylglycerols will contain PUFA . Vitamin E protects these fatty acids from radiation-induced free radical formation by the same mechanism operative in adipose cells .  | Vitamin K. ? The nutriment role of vitamin K in formation of prothrombin for blood clotting involves four vitamin K-dependent factors : factor II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor IX ( Christmas factor ) , and factor X ( Stuart-Prower factor ) . These four factors are involved in the extrinsic ( injury-activated ) and intrinsic ( platelet-activated ) coagulation system by which clots are formed . Details of the system are not completely known ; two alternate roles for vitamin K have been postulated , i.e. , in regulation of the synthesis of these coagulation factors or in conversion of their precursors to active forms . Vitamin K is stored in the liver in at least two forms , one of which is an epoxide . IF the circulating level of prothrombin is low , THEN the following sequence of reactions occurs : the epoxide is activated , vitamin K is released and reduced to its active form , it modifies the four dependent factors which activates them and allows calcium binding of prothrombin to form thrombin , and thrombin interacts with fibrinogen to form fibrin , the base of the blood clot . THE FAT-SOLUBLE VITAMINS : DEFICIENT SUPPLY Clinical symptoms have been attributed to deficient intake of and/or block in utilization of vitamins A , D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or when it is provided in its active form , remission of symptoms occurs . From these observations , nutritionists have inferred that intake from exogenous sources is essential . In the case of vitamin E , deficiency in premature infants has been demonstrated but not in adults . Discussion of the effects of deficient supply of each vitamin follows . Vitamin A Deficiency is progressive ; three levels of severity of deficiency have been characterized . IF intake is low for a long period of time AND liver stores are depleted , THEN mild clinical symptoms will develop . Vision is affected ; nyctalopia or night blindness is the symptom . The accepted explanation for this manifestation is : since cis vitamin A aldehyde is not regenerated as rapidly as it is converted to trans retinol , it will be in short supply . Trans retinol accumulates and is translocated to the liver via systemic circulation . The liver reconverts it to the cis retinal form . Since the circulating level of cis retinal is low because of continuous withdrawal by the eye , cis retinal is released into circulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye tissue is rapidly metabolizing the cis form , its demand exceeds the supply . Because supply takes longer , some impulses are not transmitted , so one is night blind .  | I F supply is very short , THEN moderate clinical symptoms develop and epithelial tissue becomes involved in addition to optical symptoms . I F the supply of vitamin A is very short , THEN squamous cells are formed in lieu of mucus cells . As a result , there is no mucus . So , the tissues become dry and hard . Thus , the barrier to bacteria is destroyed and they invade and infect . IF almost no vitamin A is available , THEN severe clinical symptoms develop . Xerophthalmia progresses to blindness . The lacrimal glands cease production of tears , so the corneal tissue dries up and becomes hard . It then lacks resistance to attack by bacteria , so it becomes infected , When scar tissue develops , blindness results . Follicular hyperkeratosis develops in the skin . The ducts of the sweat glands and hair follicles are destroyed , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry , and scaly and covered with petechia , i.e. , a roughness that looks like goose flesh . Bone growth also is affected . The cartilage is abnormal and the crystals of apatite are deposited irregularly so bones are misshapen . Bone and joint pain is excruciating . Vitamin D Rickets and osteomalacia are the common manifestations ; both result because calcium metabolism is impaired . Recent evidence supports the position that rickets may result from the combination of vitamin D deficiency with a preexisting metabolic defect in phosphate transport ( Bronner 1976 ) . In this deficiency state , the 25-HCC is not converted to 1,25-DHCC in response to low circulating levels of Ca " and/or phosphate . IF the vitamin D supply is low , THEN CaBP is not produced in the intestinal mucosa , so both Ca " and phosphate absorption are impaired . THEREFORE , the circulating level of Ca " and phosphate falls AND they are mobilized from bone in order to maintain the circulating level for supply to muscles and nerves . Heart and lung action are critical to survival and take priority over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low , withdrawal from bones results in progressive demineralization . In the case of a child , the effects are observed sooner and are more severe since growth needs inflate demand . Because the bone tissue can not mineralize properly , the protein base that should extend is squashed into an irregular shape . Any long bones that are weight-bearing bend to approximate a triangle , the strongest shape . Hence , bow legs develop . In the case of an adult who is tall and heavy , when resorption reaches a critical point , the bones are so weakened that they can not bear the weight . Spontaneous fractures result . These conditions are painful like arthritis because when the bones  | bend , they pull muscles , ligaments , etc. , in an unnatural way . The stress causes the pain . Vitamin E IF vitamin E stores have not been developed in a premature infant via placental transfer , AND IF the child is fed a cow 's milk formula , THEN a deficiency syndrome involving capillary fragility ( bruising ) may develop . IF an adult consumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years or so , THEN the mean survival time for RBC is reduced from 120+ days to approximately 110 days , but the time of onset of this manifestation is unknown as it was unlooked for . Otherwise , there is no detectable mental or physical impairment even when the circulating level of vitamin E is reduced to 20% of normal . Vitamin K Because of intestinal production , dietary deficiency is rare . Deficiency is more likely to result from administration of too large a dose of dicoumerol , a drug that is structurally similar to vitamin K and acts as its antagonist . It is given to heart patients to decrease the probability of clotting . When too much is given , a medical problem , vitamin K is given to restore clotting time . THE FAT-SOLUBLE VITAMINS : AVAILABLE IN EXCESS Some Americans are taking megadoses of vitamins A and/or E , having accepted some of the popular myths that have resulted from misinterpretation of the facts . This is an unfortunate outcome , as the cumulative effect can be development of a toxicity syndrome . The fat-soluble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adipose tissue and intramuscular deposits . Since fat deposits in many people are extensive and increasing , potential uptake is almost unlimited . Fatsoluble vitamin uptake is progressive . IF the circulating level increases , THEN uptake by adipose cells is facilitated . A slight drop in the circulating level then facilitates additional absorption . So , more is dissolved in adipose tissue . Since uptake potential is open-ended , and at some concentration it interferes with cellular functions , toxic side-effects are observed . The minimum toxic dose is unknown as is the cumulative level at which symptoms develop . People are highly variable in the amount of  | fat stored and , therefore , probably in the amount of excess vitamins that t hey can tolerate . The effects of toxicity of the fat-soluble vitamins are described below . Vitamin A and the Carotenes Not much is known . Acute cases are a public health problem . About 75% of these occur in infants 2 to 8 months of age . A dose of 300,000+ IU will cause symptoms in an adult in 1V2 to 36 hours . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in adults is more severe in women . For women , the symptoms are amenorrhea and consequent sterility , irritability , loss of hair , jaundice , and bone pain . In men , the symptoms are joint pain , thickening of the long bones , baldness , and jaundice . When the circulating level of carotenes is high ( carotenemia ) , the skin of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet turn orange . Vitamin D The basic symptoms in children and adults are similar : weakness , lethargy , anorexia , and constipation . Also , the circulating level of calcium is reset to a high level ( hypercalcemia , and may persist for months after intake is reduced to zero ) so bones soften and soft tissues such as those of the kidney may calcify . Vitamin E No effects have been observed and no known excretion mechanism exists . Pharmacologic doses , i.e. , 300 to 600 IU/day , lead to tissue saturation ; since information is limited , an intake this high is not recommended , pending further information . Vitamin K @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults . Since the colon is sterile at birth and placental transfer may not have occurred , infants are routinely given a shot of vitamin K. The margin between too little and too much is narrow . IF an excess is given , THEN jaundice results because when the blood clots there is an increase in breakdown of RBC , resulting in production of the by-product bilirubin ( a yellow pigment ) . In adults , IF an excess is taken , THEN it is excreted.  | THE FAT-SOLUBLE VITAMINS : FOOD ECOLOGY AND LIFE EXPECTANCY Exogenous supply of fat-soluble vitamins can result in toxicity , so warnings have been issued and a movement to limit availability has gained favor . An overdose ( O.D. ) from food alone , except for polar bear liver which contains toxic amounts of vitamin A , does not occur . Rather , in the case of infants and children , it is a result of a mistake in dose ; a teaspoonful rather than a drop is given . In the case of adults , continued therapeutic doses of vitamin A for acne have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about consumption of a cup or more of carrot juice per day ( a fad utilizing a juicer gimmick ) on a continuing basis . Usually , such fads wear out before harm can be done , but the possibility exists that a compulsive person might continue to use the juicer for a much greater than normal length of time .  | The Water-Soluble Vitamins : Ascorbic Acid Since 1970 , there has been much controversy among scientists regarding the need for ascorbic acid and the quantity necessary . The controversy is not resolved . Linus Pauling 's book has created a furor , and some Americans have been induced to take pharmacologic doses of ascorbic acid on a regular basis . The position of the " Nutrition Establishment " is that such doses are both unnecessary and undesirable . It could be dangerous and there are many unknowns . ASCORBIC ACID : NORMALLY AVAILABLE Food sources of ascorbic acid are citrus fruits ( oranges , lemons , limes , grapefruit , etc. ) , tomatoes which contain only one-third to one-half as much of the vitamin per serving , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropical fruits are also good sources , but availability in the continental United States is limited . Ascorbic acid is easily destroyed by heat and/or oxidation . Therefore , careful handling is necessary to protect vitamin activity . Sodium ascorbate , the compound added to cereals , is stable . Rose hips is a good source , but the quantity available is limited . Digestion/Absorption Ascorbic acid is absorbed from the small intestine . Since no transport mechanism has been identified , absorption is presumably by passive diffusion . Given ingestion of a known quantity of ascorbic acid , the percentage absorbed is variable depending on its use as a reducing agent .  | It is carried by the portal blood flow to the liver for use and/or distribution . Metabolism of Ascorbic Acid ? in General The body pool of ascorbic acid is small and must be resupplied frequently . Since people tend to forget whether they have consumed a rich or a moderately good source the previous day or several days previously , nutritionists recommend a daily intake to be sure . There is no accepted storage site where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulate some . All cells , especially leucocytes , retain a small quantity for local use . The circulating level is low and any excess is excreted . The urinary excretion point is 1.4 mg/100ml . The salient nutriment role of ascorbic acid is as the universal reducing agent in biological reactions . Unlike most other vitamins , ascorbic acid has no known coenzyme function . Other nutriment functions have been identified , but the mechanisms by which they are accomplished are delineated only partially . These known functions include roles as : ( a ) a cofactor in the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline and lysine to hydroxylysine in collagen formation . This is the basis of involvement in wound healing , bone and tooth formation , and capillary wall strength/fragility. ( b ) a cofactor in conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine ( c ) a cofactor in conversion of the B vitamin folic acid to its active form , folinic acid ( d ) a cofactor in reduction of Fe ' to Fe " for absorption , for release from transferrin , and for release from ferritin ( e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) an agent in response to stress ? infection , injury , shock . All of these decrease the stores in the adrenal cortex and depress the circulating level , suggesting either increased need or increased destruction . ASCORBIC ACID : DEFICIENT SUPPLY OR INFLATED DEMAND For centuries , man has suffered and died from scurvy , the severe deficiency disease that results from continued lack of ascorbic acid . In this severe form , deficiency is rare among Americans . The development of deficiency is progressive . Observation of persons with no exogenous source of ascorbic acid has defined the clinical picture . Development of symptoms , though continuous , has been divided into three stages .  | In Stage I , symptoms are mild . IF deficient for some weeks , THEN the circulating level falls so response to stress is slow . In Stage II , moderate symptoms develop . These involve several or-gans/tissues : ( a ) skin ? IF deficient 4 to 6 months , THEN the hair follicles become clogged and hairs ingrown , the texture becomes hard and horny ( keratosis ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circulation problem develops , pressure builds up and small hemorrhages occur so that the skin looks like it has been bruised . ( b ) gums ? IF deficient 6 months , THEN the tissues become swollen , tiny hemorrhages appear , infection sets in , and the teeth become loose due to lack of intercellular cement . The mouth becomes very sore . ( c ) CNS ? IF deficient for at least 6 months , THEN the adrenal hormones are secreted in excess . The abnormal stimulation causes nerves to fatigue a little sooner , so irritability develops . Personality changes may develop from lack of control in reactions . ( d ) any tissue ? Rate of wound healing is decreased ; surgical patients must be watched . IF supply has been deficient and/or is insufficient to meet the inflated demand , THEN the quantity and quality of intercellular cement is decreased . Both the rate of wound healing and the strength of the scar tissue are reduced . Skin , which should heal in five days , requires ten or more days to heal . Deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate allows stitches to be removed in five days ) . When the tissues do heal , the scar is not strong and wounds will reopen with slight stress . In Stage III , life is endangered . This is the stage traditionally associated with scurvy . Manifestations are as follows : ( a ) heart-lung function is impaired ? These are active muscles that need continuous renewal and repair . Since collagen formation is impaired and nerve impulse transmission is abnormal , function is impaired . ( b ) bones are deformed and painful ? Interference with normal collagen formation results in abnormal deposition of the mineral salts ; the matrix is squashed so shape is deformed . In children , the long bones are stunted and buttons develop on the ends of ribs . Moreover , lack of collagen weakens ligaments and tendons , so failure to maintain normal bone alignment leads to pain . ( c ) blood ? A megaloblastic anemia develops . Iron absorption , transport , and release from storage are impaired , so the quantity of iron available for incorporation in hemoglobin is reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folinic acid which is required for synthesis of some amino acids and purines used in DNA and RNA formation , RBC formation is reduced . Together , these two combine to cause the development of the megaloblastic anemia.  | ASCORBIC ACID : AVAILABLE IN EXCESS The general effects of chronic ingestion of a small excess ( still at physiologic levels ) have long been known and are trivial . IF a person chronically ingests a slight excess or intermittently a larger excess , THEN some is not absorbed , some is absorbed and excreted , and some is absorbed and retained . The effects of chronic ingestion of pharmacologic doses ( 1 g or more per day ) are different , and may be harmful . IF a megadose is ingested chronically so that a greater-than-normal quantity accumulates , THEN the set-point for the circulating level is reset at a higher level . IF the person reduces intake sharply ( it may still be greatly above normal ) or when the demand is sharply increased by stress , THEN the body will respond to the relative supply deficit with deficiency symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnitude of the supply deficit . Thus , chronic ingestion of a megadose results in addiction and can result in conditioned deficiency . The body will go through withdrawal symptoms . This state can be very dangerous . Intermittent use of megadose ingestion of ascorbic acid in treatment of a " cold " may be appropriate ; no preventive action has been observed . The explanation for the effect of a pharmacologic dose is incomplete but it appears that IF a megadose is ingested with aspirin at the onset of a " cold , " THEN it increases membrane permeability to aspirin , thus increasing its effectiveness in decreasing the fever and in fighting the virus . As a result , there is some alleviation of symptoms . Ascorbic acid does not cure the " cold " ; its role is that of a cofactor . Chronic ingestion of ascorbic acid in megadose quantities is a recent phenomenon , so long-term effects are unknown . Some facts that have begun to emerge have created a cause for concern . Until more is known , megadose consumption is not recommended . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IF ascorbic acid is chronically ingested in excess , THEN intestinal absorption of iron is augmented and the quantity stored may become excessive , especially in men . ( b ) acidosis ? A negligible problem because of buffer base reserves . ( c ) oxaluria ? 50% of the quantity of urinary oxalate is normally derived from ingested ascorbic acid . If the person has normal kidney function , kidney stones are unlikely to develop . ( d ) hypoglycemia ? No relationship has been demonstrated . However , a false positive test results because ascorbate is a reducing agent . The physician should be notified of customary megadose intake so that an alternate lab method of testing is used . ( e ) gastrointestinal disturbances ? A sensitivity can develop that causes the symptoms of nausea , cramps , and diarrhea . In this case , the  | ascorbic acid should be taken with or following meals so that it is diluted . ( f ) serum cholesterol levels ? The circulating level may be elevated and atherosclerosis may be aggravated . At the present time , the known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare except for the problems of systemic conditioning , and increasing the serum cholesterol level . However , these effects may be more important than currently recognized so they are under study . Destruction of vitamin B12 by ascorbic acid was reported as a hazard of megadose consumption . On further study , however , the point was refuted ( Newmark et al . 1976 ) with evidence of a technical problem leading to erroneous findings . Clearly , the effects of megadose consumption of ascorbic acid are not fully understood . In the meantime , a moderate intake is recommended . ASCORBIC ACID : FOOD ECOLOGY AND LIFE EXPECTANCY Ascorbic acid intake from exogenous sources is required by man and a few other species that lack one of the enzymes necessary for its synthesis . Dietary surveys have repeatedly shown that ascorbic acid intake of Americans is highly variable ; some take too little and some take too much and many are erratic in intake . Although some dietary changes were evident , until the mid-1960s potatoes and cabbage were still major sources . Potatoes , though only half as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by many Americans ; more than two servings per day was not uncommon . Cabbage , which is approximately equal to orange juice in its ascorbic acid content , was consumed several times a week . Consumption trend lines for potatoes and cabbage have shown a downturn for some years , so other foods have become major sources of ascorbic acid . Availability of and consumption of citrus fruits , especially oranges and grapefruit , have increased . In addition , fruit drinks have been fortified . Even more recently , ready-to-eat breakfast cereals have been fortified to provide about one-fourth of the amount needed . Since the mid-1960s , questions of the comparative stability of natural and added synthetic ascorbic acid in fruit drinks and other foods have been investigated and partially resolved . Findings are : ( a ) In order to make a label claim that fruit drinks contain 25 to 30 mg/serving , the quantity added by manufacturers must exceed this amount . ( b ) Stability of synthetic ascorbic acid in fruit drinks is a function of pH and time ; in acid fruit drinks it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The bioavailability of synthetic ascorbic acid is slightly greater than that of natural ascorbic acid in orange juice .  | Timing of ascorbic acid intake in relation to intake of iron , and perhaps other nutrients , is a critical variable related to its effectiveness as a reducing agent . In this regard , research has demonstrated that there is no carryover effect . Therefore , to potentiate iron uptake , both ascorbic acid and iron must be present in the chyme simultaneously . Therefore , IF this beneficial effect in potentiating iron uptake is desired , THEN food and/or supplement intake must be distributed among feedings or consciously paired with ingestion of sources of iron .  | The Water-Soluble Vitamins : The B Complex Thiamin , riboflavin , niacin , B6 ( pyridoxine ) , pantothenic acid , folic acid , biotin , and 13 , are the B vitamins . The essentiality of consumption of an exogenous source of these vitamins was demonstrated years ago . Nonetheless , according to the 1976 Report of the President 's Biomedical Research Panel , Large areas of ignorance exist concerning : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the effects of vitamin undersupply or oversupply on the development and treatment of acute or subacute disease conditions ; ( 3 ) the extent of variability in vitamin requirements ( or vitamin toxicity at high levels ) in different members of the population ; and ( 4 ) the interrelationships of vitamins and drugs ... Almost nothing is known about ( 1 ) the comparative rate of turnover of individual vitamin-dependent enzymes in intact organisms ; ( 2 ) the relative rates of turnover of apoenzymes and their coenzymes ; ( 3 ) the rates of coenzyme loss from individual enzymes during states of vitamin deficiency ; ( 4 ) the efficiency of salvage pathways for individual vitamins ; ( 5 ) the metabolic control devices that operate at high levels of vitamin feeding ; ( 6 ) the schemes for metabolic degradation of vitamins in animals and man ; and ( 7 ) the rates at which degradation or excretion occur at different levels of vitamin intake . Such studies are essential if the relationship of deficiency disease to vitamin level is to be understood . From the above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is for this reason that nutritionists recommend moderate intakes . THE WATER-SOLUBLE B VITAMINS : NORMALLY AVAILABLE The B vitamins can be supplied from the plant and/or animal tissues consumed as food . But , a variety of foods is necessary since no one food is a concentrated source of any and may not be a good source of another ,  | e.g. , pork is a good source of thiamin and milk is a good source of riboflavin . Whole grain breads and cereals are generally good sources , as - ire their enriched white flour versions ( except for folic acid which was unknown at the time the enrichment legislation was enacted ) . The supply of vitamin B12 is an exception . Omnivores and carnivores usually ingest a sufficient quantity of B12 to meet their metabolic needs . Vegetarians may not . This is because vitamin B12 is synthesized by bacteria and fungi but not by yeasts , plants , animals , or man . Grains , fruits , and vegetables may contain trace amounts absorbed from the soil . Since B12 is stored in glandular and muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish and shellfish , eggs , and dairy products . Some of these sources may be proscribed , so the amount available to the vegetarian is limited . A concentrated source from bacterial production is a commercially available alternative . Digestion/Absorption With the exception of vitamin B12i absorption of these vitamins takes place in the upper end of the small intestine . In general , they are destroyed by alkaline medium , so absorption must take place prior to infusion of the pancreatic fluids . Proteases liberate the vitamins from their protein bases . Some are then phosphorylated for rapid transport through the mucosal wall . Vitamin B12 is absorbed in the ileum , after a long and complex sequence of steps . HCl in gastric juice splits B12 from its animal protein matrix . Then , the free B12 combines with intrinsic factor ( IF ) for transport along the alimentary canal to the ileum . In the ileum , it is liberated from IF and combines with calcium for transport across the mucosal wall . Within the ileal cells , it is converted to its coenzyme form 5 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liver and attaches to its transport protein Transcobalamin II , which also facilitates its uptake by cells of target tissues such as the liver and bone marrow . New information on the processes of digestion and absorption of folic acid indicates some unique factors that affect bioavailability of this vitamin . Folic acid is pteroylglutamic acid ( PGA ) , but it is not found in foods and is not biologically active in this form . In foods , it occurs as one of the polyglutamates . These are related to PGA by : ( a ) containing additional glutamic acid residues ( b ) being reduced by the addition of H+ at positions 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 , i.e. , they are tetrahydrofolates ( c ) having single carbon substituents at positions 5 or 10 , e.g. , methylfolates , formylfolates  | The most common food form is 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate . In order to be absorbed , these pteroylpolyglutamates must be hydrolyzed to pteroylmonoglutamate . The enzyme - y- glutamyl hydrolase , also known as folate conjugase , catalyzes this reaction . Apparently , according to Reisenauer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity occurs at two points . Membrane-bound conjugase in the brush border of the jejunum probably partially hydrolyzes the polyglutamates to the monoglutamate form so that it can enter the mucosal cell . An additional soluble conjugase inside the mucosal cell may complete the task . Beyond this , the sequence of steps in folate absorption and membrane transport is unclear . The liver is the storage site for B vitamins . The quantity stored , with the exception of B12 , is only sufficient for two to three months . Therefore , consumption of an exogenous source must be frequent . Here again , to circumvent the memory problem of the timing and quantity of the previous dose , nutritionists recommend a daily intake . Vitamin B12 is stored in micro-quantities in the liver , kidneys , heart , muscles , pancreas , testes , brain , blood , spleen , and bone marrow . The liver alone can store 2,000 to 5,000 mcg , a 3- to 5-year supply . Water-Soluble B Vitamin Metabolism ? in General The most frequent nutriment function of B vitamins is as a constituent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exact step where a specific vitamin-activated coenzyme is required as a cofactor for a specific enzyme has been identified . There may be additional steps that are presently unknown . Known nutriment functions for each of the B vitamins are listed below : Thiamin. ? As thiamin pyrophosphate ( TPP ) , also called cocarboxylase , which is one of its metabolically active forms , it is involved as a coenzyme in reactions involving oxidative decarboxylation in carbohydrate metabolism , e.g. , conversion of pyruvic acid to active acetate and carbon dioxide , which initiates the reactions of the Krebs cycle . As thiamin diphosphate ( TDP ) , which is the other metabolically active form of thiamin , it is involved in the transketolation step in which glucose is converted to active glyceraldehyde as the first step in transformation of carbohydrate to fat . Riboflavin. ? As flavin mononucleotide ( FMN , a riboflavin monophosphate compound ) , it is involved as a coenzyme in deamination of amino acids . As the coenzyme flavin adenine dinucleotide ( FAD , a riboflavin diphosphate compound ) , it is involved as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatty acid , and glucose metabolism . It also is involved in the systems of H+ transfer in cellular oxidation . In this role riboflavin is a constituent of one of the metalloflavoprotein enzymes . These contain molybdenum and/or iron . The function of the flavin moiety is to accept or donate an electron in the oxidation-reduction process . Important enzymes of this type are the ferredoxins in which Fe is bonded to the S of cysteine , forming an iron-sulfur bridge as a part of the enzyme structure . In the oxidized form , both iron atoms are in the Fe+++ form . In the reduced form , one is Fe " and the other is Fe+++ Niacin ( Nicotinic Acid ) . ? Its coenzyme form is a cofactor with thiamin and/or riboflavin in the anaerobic oxidation via the " respiratory chain " of reactions by which amino acids and fatty acids are oxidized as well as in several reactions in the Krebs cycle that transform glucose to energy , carbon dioxide , and water . For example , nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD , a niacin diphosphate compound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step of conversion of pyruvic acid to active acetate . Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADP , a niacin triphosphate compound ) , as well as NAD , is involved in the Krebs cycle with FMN and FAD . NADPH is produced primarily by the pentose phosphate pathway . The major function of this pathway is to produce NADPH , which must be supplied in sufficient quantities to meet demands for it as a reductant in numerous biosynthetic reactions involving NAD . These include , but may not be limited to : ( a ) formation of long-chain fatty acids and steroids ( b ) conversion of glucose to sorbitol ( c ) conversion of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid ( d ) conversion of glucuronic acid to L-gulonic acid ( e ) conversion of pyruvic acid to malic acid ( f ) hydroxylation in forming PUFA and in the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine . The utilization of NAD in these reactions does not require ATP or metabolites of the Krebs cycle so it provides an alternative . It may be regulated by need for NADPH . Niacin is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike many other nutrients , its supply needs are partially met by an endogenous source . Tryptophan , an amino acid , is a precursor of niacin . Therefore , in assessment of niacin nutriture , the concept of niacin equivalents is used . This means that the expected amount of niacin available from endogenous sources should be added to that from exogenous ( dietary and/or supplements ) sources . Research has demonstrated that the mean tryptophan content of animal protein is 1.4% and of vegetable  | protein is 1% . For convenience , 1% is used in computing the quantity of niacin that may be produced by endogenous conversion . The mean quantity of niacin produced by the conversion is 1 mg/60 mg tryptophan ingested . A sample calculation follows : ( a ) IF the protein intake is 125 g , the mean American intake , THEN 1250 mg tryptophan will be involved ( 125 g protein X 0.01 = 1.25 g or 1250 mg tryptophan ) . ( b ) Since 1 mg niacin is produced/60 mg tryptophan , 21 mg niacin will be produced ( 1250 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the group designation for the three known forms , i.e. , pyridoxine , pyridoxal , and pyridoxamine . In its active form of pyridoxal phosphate ( PLP ) , its nutriment function is as a coenzyme in many reactions of protein , fat , and carbohydrate metabolism . B6 as a coenzyme in protein metabolism is involved in numerous types of reactions that include , but are not limited to : ( a ) decarboxylation of amino acids , e.g. , the conversion of tryptophan to serotonin which is a vasoconstrictor ( b ) deamination , e.g. , of serine and threonine ( c ) transamination of the various amino acids to form nonessential amino acids or other non-protein nitrogen compounds ( d ) transsulfuration , e.g. , from methionine to serine ( e ) conversion of tryptophan to niacin ( f ) incorporation of glycine in heme ( g ) active transport of amino acids across the mucosal wall and into cells ( h ) biosynthesis of cysteine B6 has an indirect role in CHO metabolism because the end-products of the transformations listed above are finally degraded through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid metabolism is related to its function in the conversion of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid . B6 exists in foods in the bound form . In some foods it is bound to proteins , but in others it is bound to an undefined substance ( Nelson , Burgin , and Cerda 1977 ) . Cooking has been demonstrated to enhance bioavailability . Otherwise , it is more available in the synthetic than in the natural food form . Pantothenic Acid. ? Its most widely recognized nutriment function is as a constituent of coenzyme A , which is converted to active acetate . This vitamin coenzyme role in acetylation reactions includes , but is not limited to , the following : ( a ) Active acetate derived from amino acid , CHO and/or fatty acid metabolism combines with oxaloacetate derived from amino acid or CHO metabolism as the first reaction in the Krebs cycle .  | ( b ) Active acetate activates fatty acids , which then form either TG or keto acids to be degraded via the Krebs cycle . ( c ) Active acetate combines with amino acids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reactions that produce TG or glucose . ( d ) Active acetate is one of the basic units from which cholesterol is synthesized ; all of its carbon atoms are supplied by active acetate . In turn , cholesterol is a precursor of the steroid hormones. ( e ) Active acetate is a precursor of active succinic acid , succinyl CoA , which combines with glycine in the initial reaction by which heme is synthesized . A less widely recognized nutriment function of pantothenic acid is as a constituent of fatty acid synthetase ( ACP ) . This enzyme is necessary in fatty acid synthesis after the initial step in which active acetate condenses with malonyl CoA to form a short-chain fatty acid . ACP combines with the short-chain fatty acid , which activates it and enables it to continue elongation by stepwise condensation with malonyl CoA . Whether pantothenic acid is a constituent of other enzymes or has unidentified nutriment functions is unknown . Folic Acid or Folacin. ? It is reduced to its active form , folinic acid , as the first step in preparation for subsequent interactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its role in 1-carbon transfer in the synthesis of thymine , which is a pyrimidine base , and purines , both of which are constituents of DNA . Cell growth and reproduction are thus folic acid dependent ; this is especially noticeable in relation to RBC formation . THFA also is involved in the conversions of glycine to serine and of phenylalanine to tyrosine . Methyl THFA provides the methyl group for synthesis of methionine , choline , and neurotransmitters such as serotonin . THFA also is involved in hydroxylation of proline , a step in collagen formation . Para-aminobenzoic acid ( PABA ) is not a nutrient in human nutrition , although it is essential for some microorganisms . It is only a necessary constituent of folic acid . Biotin. ? Its major nutriment function is as a coenzyme in carboxylation reactions , in which carbon dioxide is transferred from one compound to another . For example , it is necessary in the reaction by which the chain length of fatty acids is increased , and in the reaction of pyruvic acid and oxaloacetic acid in the Krebs cycle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other functions are related to synthesis of purines and in activation of deaminases for threonine , serine , and aspartic acids ? by which these are converted to keto acids.  | BIZ ( Cobalamin ) . ? The cobalamide coenzymes are necessary for methyl group transfers in numerous reactions in amino acid , glucose , and fatty acid metabolism . Bit is a coenzyme in the transfer of three methyl groups from methionine to serine in the synthesis of choline , which is a component of lecithin and the sphingomyelins . It is also necessary , in conjunction with ascorbic acid , for the conversion of folic acid to THFA , hence its roles in DNA synthesis and RBC formation . Water-Soluble B Vitamin Metabolism ? in Specific Tissues The B vitamins are active primarily as cofactors in common metabolic reactions that occur in all cells . From the available evidence , there is no indication that particular tissues have specific needs . THE WATER-SOLUBLE B VITAMINS : DEFICIENT SUPPLY OR INFLATED DEMAND Although the exact steps where the various vitamins are required are known and well defined deficiency syndromes have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generalized deficiency syndrome is more typical . Usually , protein , calcium , and vitamins A and C are also deficient when intake of the B vitamins is deficient . The observed GI , CNS , and cardiovascular symptoms are a direct effect of decreased glucose supply and are only indirectly related to lack of the B vitamins . The effects of deficiency of each of the B vitamins are summarized below . Thiamin The classic syndrome beri-beri is characterized by polyneuritis , muscular weakness , and GI disturbance . The polyneuritis reflects a decreased supply of glucose , which is the predominant fuel of CNS tissue . When insufficient , motor control is impaired , alertness and reflex responses are decreased , and general symptoms of lethargy and lassitude are observed . Symptoms are progressive through nerve irritation to paralysis . Muscle weakness of heart and vascular tissue leads to edema and cardiac failure . GI distress is due to decreased mucosal supply of glucose which precludes normal function of the musculature , secretory glands , and absorption mechanisms . The results are anorexia , decreased HCl secretion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epithelial tissue inflammation and breakdown . It is characterized by the following symptoms : cheilosis , i.e. , cracking and dry scaliness of the lips and corners of the mouth ; cracks at the angles of the nose ; glossitis , i.e. , the tongue is swollen and typically red ; corneal vascularization accompanied by burning and itching ; and seborrheic dermatitis , i.e. , a scaly , greasy skin eruption . The links between lack at the biochemical level and clinical manifestations are unknown . Niacin The classic syndrome pellagra is characterized by dermatitis in areas exposed to sunlight ? the reddish rash later turns dark and the skin is very rough ; diarrhea ; dementia ? irritability , anxiety , depression , confusion or delerium , etc. ; and finally , death . Here again , the links between lack at the biochemical level and clinical manifestations are unknown . 13 " The deficiency is associated with development of a hypochromic , microcytic anemia and/or by CNS disturbances as a result of impairment of the conversions resulting in the formation of y-aminobutyric acid and serotonin , compounds important in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using oral contraceptive agents ( OCA ) develop functional biochemical manifestations that suggest B6 deficiency . This is a relative deficiency induced by inflated demand . Mean serum levels of PLP are significantly lower when OCA are first used , but in some women serum levels rise toward normal by the sixth month of use . An increased exogenous supply of B6 is necessary in order for some to achieve normal circulating levels . Pantothenic Acid. ? This is unknown under natural conditions . Folic Acid. ? The macrocytic anemia of pregnancy and the megaloblastic anemia in premature infants have been attributed to folic acid deficiency . During the third trimester of pregnancy , the circulating levels of hemoglobin and folic acid fall below the normal standard for nonpregnant women . The prevalence of macrocytic anemia is small , and has been estimated as less than 2% of pregnant women . Apparently , despite the relative deficiency induced by the inflated demand to supply situation , there is enough to enable substantial nucleic acid synthesis for  | production of placental as well as fetal tissues . Among those whose customary folic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the macrocytic anemia may be manifest . Infants born to these mothers present a megaloblastic anemia , i.e. , the RBC are large and immature . Folic acid deficiency is a deliberate iatrogenic deficiency that is intermittently induced in leukemia patients by the drug aminopterin , used to cause remission of the disease . It is a folic acid antagonist , i.e. , it blocks nucleic acid synthesis and , hence , the rapid proliferation of leukemic cells . When remission occurs , the deficiency and the resultant anemia are corrected . This induced deficiency is greater in severity than that resulting from simple dietary lack . Glossitis , diarrhea , weight loss , decreased RBC levels , and urinary excretion of the metabolite FIGLU are manifest . Biotin. ? A deficiency syndrome has been produced in man , but it is not known to occur naturally . Avidin , a glycoprotein in egg white , combines with biotin in the intestine , preventing its absorption . To cause a deficiency , abnormally large quantities of raw eggwhite must be consumed ? an unlikely event . So this effect is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pernicious anemia . The classic cause of this disease is the result of a rare metabolic disorder which causes a lack of intrinsic factor ( IF ) ; malabsorption results . Symptoms are severe . A more common , although infrequently observed , cause is inadequate dietary intake . Mild nervous symptoms but not anemia are seen . In severe form , pernicious anemia is a highly injurious , destructive , and potentially deadly disease in which the lack of vitamin B12 undermines health by : ( a ) creating a severe macrocytic hypochromic anemia which is marked by a progressive decrease in the number and increase in size of RBC , which results in physical symptoms of pallor and weakness . ( b ) causing achlorhydria , which results in decreased efficiency of digestion and/or malabsorption of proteins and amino acids , B vitamins , Ca , Po " etc. , and in generalized GI disturbances as a secondary effect . ( c ) nervous disturbances that result in a typical gait . This disease develops gradually by corrupting and undermining tissue processes . It is well established before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anemia is that lack of cobalamides has an indirect effect which is produced by blocking the conversion of folic acid to folinic acid . This , in turn , prevents synthesis of the pyrimidines and purines that are constituents of DNA . Lack of DNA results in incomplete RBC division , so macrocytes develop . Lack of folinic acid also blocks heme formation , so the cells are hypochromic . Insufficient hemoglobin impairs oxygen transport , hence the typical symptoms of anemia . See Chapter 10.  | The neurologic damage results from impaired formyl and methyl group transfer and consequent blocking of choline synthesis . Choline is a necessary constituent of acetylcholine , which is involved in nerve impulse transmission at the synapse , and of sphingomyelin , which is a nerve insulator . Hence , the impairment . Also , an observed , but not clearly understood effect is increased circulating levels of branched chain fatty acids such as methyl malonic acid and odd-numbered fatty acids . Treatment of pernicious anemia depends on its cause . When lack of IF is the cause , B12 injections are necessary on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal products , then use of a commercially available bacterial production concentrate is recommended . One should note that the anemia can be corrected by administration of folinic acid , but it does not correct the more serious neurologic damage that is directly related to the B12 deficiency . THE WATER-SOLUBLE B VITAMINS : EXCESS SUPPLY Little is known about the effects of chronic excess supply of the B vitamins . An excess from dietary sources is unknown . With the exception of niacin , which is used medicinally , toxicity from megadoses is unknown . The requirements for the various B vitamins are not accurately known in relation to nutriment function because quantitative analysis in vivo is impossible . Some , and perhaps most or all of the steps in various pathways where one or more of the B vitamins is necessary , have been identified . However , the information is qualitative rather than quantitative . That is , the quantity used up is unknown as are the number of reactions per cell per day and the number of cells in which the function is performed . Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an approximation of the cumulative and aggregate quantity necessary . Such studies determine the intake level associated with development of clinical manifestations and the quantity per day that is necessary to relieve the symptoms . The quantity designated as excess is an arbitrary value . It is the quantity that spills into the urine . Load dose studies have yielded some additional information which shows that the renal threshold for the various water-soluble vitamins is low . The accepted assumptions and inferences that are associated with load dose testing are : ( a ) assumption ? Plasma uptake will continue to its maximum . Withdrawal or redistribution to tissues is minimal since storage capacity is small . ( b ) assumption ? IF intake is increased greatly with a load dose , THEN one can obtain an indirect measure of uptake by computing the percentage of the dose that is excreted.  | ( c ) inference ? IF a person has had an adequate intake , THEN the percentage of the load dose that is excreted will be high or close to 100%. ( d ) inference ? IF the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained will be high and the percentage excreted will be low . ( e ) inference ? Since kidney excretion occurs when even a small dose is ingested , there is no value in ingesting a greater quantity . At the present time , the reason for kidney excretion is unknown . Two plausible , but unverified , explanations are that the kidney lacks the capacity to reabsorb these vitamins and that the circulating set-point is low , and the kidney is programmed to exclude any excess above the set-point . Undoubtedly , the fact that the urinary excretion point is low has been a factor in preventing development of a recognizable toxicity syndrome . Niacin is used therapeutically in treatment of a number of medical conditions . The standard dose administered is 100 mg , which is approximately 10 times the RDA . Toxicity can be produced with doses 1000 times the standard dose . Side-effects are common when even the standard therapeutic dose is ingested . Observation has led to the following conclusions : ( a ) IF a therapeutic dose of 50 to 100 mg is given on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metabolism occurs which results in vasodilation accompanied by flushing of the ears , face , and neck . ( b ) IF a greater dose is given , THEN the whole body may flush and the individual may experience burning , tingling , and/or itching sensations . These symptoms may last a few minutes or may persist an hour or longer . Body temperature also may rise and fever effects may result . Since enzymes can be inactivated at high temperatures , medical supervision is required in order to prevent extensive damage . A large dose also results in an increase in free and total HCl in gastric juice . Therefore , symptoms of nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea may result . THE WATER-SOLUBLE B VITAMINS : FOOD ECOLOGY AND LIFE EXPECTANCY Although unable to identify the names of the vitamins in the Bcomplex , the general public has accepted the need for supply . To many people this means the need to take vitamin pills every morning . Discovery of most of the B vitamins resulted from studies of people with gross deficiencies created by consumption of an almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1940s revealed a marginal to low intake in many segments of the American population . As a result , legislation for enrichment of cereals and flour was enacted in the  | 1940s . Since then , until recently , there have been few cases of deficiency of any of the B vitamins . Since the nutriment function of several of the B vitamins is as cofactors for various reactions in the Krebs cycle in the production of energy , the demand is linked to carbohydrate intake/metabolism . At the present time , some Americans are consuming quantities of unenriched flourbased junk foods and others eat no bread but sizeable quantities of simple sugars . Both groups may show symptoms of relative B vitamin deficiency . Others , with different food preferences , eat ready-to-eat cereals which are fortified with B vitamins and other nutrients ; their intakes may be adequate to abundant . Since intakes have changed , the first step is to expand people 's consciousness of , this fact and its expected nutritional effects . At the present time , life expectancy is not threatened by deficiency or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quality of life may be . suboptimal due to lethargy or lassitude or annoying skin conditions associated with chronic marginal intakes . Vitamin pills are available over-the-counter ( OTC ) as an alternative to dietary intake . Careful label reading is required to determine whether all of the B vitamins are included in meaningful quantities . Moreover , a number of substances with vitamin or partial vitamin function , but not demonstrated to be essential from exogenous sources , may be included as a profit-making feature . These harmless , but unnecessary substances include , but are not limited to : ( a ) lipoic acid ? This is a sulfur-containing fatty acid with a coenzyme function in the initial decarboxylation step where pyruvate is reduced to active acetate on entry to the Krebs cycle . ( b ) PABA ? This is a fragment of folic acid , discussed above . ( c ) inositol ? It has no known role in human nutrition . ( d ) choline ? It is a lipotropic agent in the liver , i.e. , it is involved in changing fat from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fatty acids to lipoproteins . The necessity of ingestion of an exogenous source has not been established , so it is not considered to be a nutrient in human nutrition . ( e ) bioflavonoids , e.g. , citrin and rutin ? These have no known function in human nutrition . The recently revised booklet listing Diabetic Exchanges includes a . statement with respect to vegetable sources of folic acid . However , there is no implication that diabetics ' need is any different from that of nondiabetics . For the first time , the 1980 RDA for niacin is listed in niacin equivalents . Tables of food composition list preformed niacin . To determine the quantity of niacin equivalents , the amount available by conversion is  | computed and is added to the sum of the preformed values obtained from the food composition tables . Then , valid inferences about intake can be drawn .  | Food and People Human food ecology and life expectancy ? how are they related ? Is longevity identical to life expectancy ? Is there some subset of the contemporary array of food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship between an intake of nutrient X that is too low or high and life expectancy ? What are the expected effects in terms of short-term and long-term quality of life ? These are some of the relevant questions . They are eternally at issue and require a personal and continuing assessment and solution . HUMAN FOOD ECOLOGY The food environment of an American involves food and people interactions at three levels : ( a ) personal , ( b ) domestic , and ( c ) international . An observation at any given point in time can be evaluated to provide an index to the quality of the interactions at that time and implications for life expectancy . A dynamic interaction exists among the various factors operative at these three levels . Thus , the pattern of man 's relation to his food environment , i.e. , human food ecology , is complex and subject to continuous change . Personal Component A life-long series of problems associated with food and people interactions presents a continuing challenge and opportunity for growth/development to all personally responsible adults . Some problems are related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people interactions for other purposes . Some problems are small and are a trivial challenge . Others are large and may test one 's limit of adaptability . Success or failure in adaptation appears to derive from one 's basic disposition rather than from one 's motives , all other things being equal .  | Initially , a motive , i.e. , the need or desire , that operates on a person 's will , causing an action to change food intake and/or other aspects of food and people interactions , is frequently supplied by a nutrition counselor or physician . But , to be effective , the individual must identify with the motive and internalize it as an integral part of his/her will . That is , the individual 's mental powers must be manifested as wishing , choosing , desiring , and intending to act in a way that is controlled , directed , and/or strongly influenced by the motive . When the motive has been internalized , one becomes motivated to change pertinent aspects of food intake and/or food and people interactions . Implementation involves thinking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These categories ( Mahoney and Caggiula 1978 ) are : ( a ) personal ability to deal with problems associated with food intake or customary food and people interactions ( b ) personal goals to be achieved by problem-oriented modification of food intake and/or food and people interactions ( c ) customary and/or preferred methods used in problem-oriented modification of food intake and/or food and people interactions ( d ) nature and adequacy of progress One 's basic disposition may support ( or undermine ) one 's will , which works for ( or against ) goal attainment . It conditions the nature and extent of one 's thinking in each of the four thought categories and the tone of one 's transactions in food and people interactions . Disposition is the dominant quality , i.e. , nature and distinguishing attribute , of customary moods and attitudes toward life and the normal transactions that are a part of living . Disposition is represented as a continuous variable with infinite gradations along a bi-polar continuum from positive to negative . It varies among people and for an individual over time according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point is used to characterize its quality at a particular place in time for the purposes of distinguishing differences in disposition among people . Thus , some are described as optimists and others as pessimists . These orientations result in very different thought and response patterns . Both are discussed below in some detail so that implications and ramifications in nutrition counseling will become clear . Optimism is defined as an inclination to put the most favorable construction upon actions or happenings or to anticipate the best possible outcome . This sets up what has been called a " self-fulfilling prophecy . " An optimistic orientation causes a person to approach situations/challenges with a hopeful , cheerful , encouraging , enthusiastic , confident , and assured manner . Thus , even when an action or happening is less positive than expected , the construction is facilitating toward acceptance or solution . The individual construes , i.e. , understands or explains the sense or  | intention of the action or happening , in a positive way or with respect to having done the best possible , given the circumstances . The construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construing , interpreting , or explaining in a positive manner , sets up a situation in which the individual is open to suggestions for modification of the goals , methods , and other aspects related to the circumstances under which the less positive actions or happenings occurred . Thus , progress evaluation focuses on emerging aspects that can be changed . The explanation of why an optimistic person eats/does not eat food X is related to the use of reason in implementation of methods of modifying food intake and/or food and people interactions . This focus suppresses emotional counter-productive thoughts and responses . Thus , actions tend to be rational , i.e. , related to , based on , or agreeable to reason . So , reason is restored to consciousness , is held in the mind , and thereby exerts a positive influence or force in the modification of food intake and/or some aspect of the food and people interaction . Accordingly , the rationale for behavior modification , i.e. , explanations of controlling principles of opinion , belief , practices , and phenomena associated with food intake and/or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the optimist uses supportive rationalization , i.e. , the attribution of one 's actions to rational , credible , and creditable motives without analysis of true ( especially unconscious ) motives so as to provide plausible but untrue reasons for behavior . The individual may need additional information or new techniques but can independently work through a series of progressively closer approximations to what is wanted . Thus , use of reason reinforces other positive aspects . Pessimism is defined as an inclination to emphasize adverse aspects , conditions , and possibilities or to expect the worst possible outcome . This also sets up what has been called a " self-fulfilling prophecy . " A pessimistic orientation causes a person to deny the existence and/or effects of situations/challenges or at best to approach them in a hopeless , doubting , dispairing , anxious , and insecure manner . Thus , when an action or happening is less positive than expected , the construction is negative . Therefore , innumerable difficulties surface that appear to mitigate against attainment of a satisfactory solution . The person construes the action or happening in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes defensive and looks for excuses . Therefore , progress evaluation becomes reflexive unless redirected ? it tends to focus on the person 's failures , which are beside the point . If the action or happening is a small thing , the individual needs to be given assistance in refocusing on modification of the methods or other aspects of the circumstances that can be changed to bring action back on a positive course . IF the action or happening is a major thing , THEN the individual needs to be given assistance in finding a face-saving alternative goal . Note : Many pessimists view retargeting  | downward as totally unacceptable . As a result of efforts to get them to retarget , they become fatalistic and abandon the goal . The explanation of why a pessimistic person eats/does not eat food X is related to the lack of reason in implementation of problem-oriented methods of modifying food intake and/or food and people interactions . The pessimistic focus allows emotional counter-productive thoughts and responses to overwhelm the will . The result is that the person loses any semblance of self-control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or guided by reason . Instead , some active power such as rebellion , vengeance , or fear becomes a compelling force . This force then creates resistance to positive modifications and/or sets in motion dysfunctional negative modifications of some aspect of the food and people interaction . The unwanted outcomes that result reinforce the pessimistic disposition . Moreover , rationalizations tend to be given in lieu of a rationale for behavior . As a result , the individual can not work through a series of approximations toward goal attainment without extensive help . A person with a generally optimistic disposition may have a pessimistic outlook with respect to any one of the four categories of thought as a result of previous negative experiences in that domain . IF one is insecure with respect to personal ability in dealing with problems , THEN supportive review of planned changes will decrease anxiety and the likelihood of panic-related impulsive actions . IF one is uncertain about goals , THEN supportive discussion of alternatives will decrease the likelihood of unfocused activity . IF one is uncertain about methods , THEN supportive review of appropriateness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can minimize the likelihood of disappointing mistakes . IF one is impatient with limited progress , THEN supportive review of accomplishments can reveal whether the pace can be increased or one has to be content with small but continued improvement . Care must be taken to avoid development of a dependency . In the context of the person 's disposition as it conditions responses to the need for dietary change , other aspects of the personal component of the food environment begin to make sense . The personal component is based on the particulars of the near environment of the individual , i.e. , physical , emotional/psychological , aesthetic , economic , social . To define the personal component , one must obtain information of the following types : ( a ) who he/she eats with ( b ) what plant or animal tissues are defined as food ( or poison ) ( c ) when foods are consumed , i.e. , time of day , season of the year for specific items ( d ) where food is consumed , i.e. , the boundaries of the eating territory , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why some foods are consumed at certain times , under certain con-ditions ( f ) how food is consumed , e.g. , state ? raw or cooked , speed ? fast or slow , utensils used , type of service involved , etc . Resources of time , energy , money , skills , and food/nutrition information may be involved variously with different expectations for outcome at different points in time . This chapter and subsequent chapters in this section discuss many facets of these and other related aspects . Time available for acquisition , preparation , and service of food determines , at least to some degree , what is consumed and its eating qualities . All other things being equal , when time and skill come together , the potential for a positive food and people interaction is increased . Otherwise , quality may have to be sacrificed to convenience . Energy available ( physical , mental , or petro-chemical ) is also a factor in the ecological relationship between a person and his/her food . It is often a limiting factor , e.g. , physical energy limits may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food prepared . Mental energy is one of the determinants of the go-no go decision on whether to plan menus , control nutrient intake , etc . Petro-chemical energy availability determines whether conservation and recycling measures predominate in food product design as well as the degree of convenience that can be purchased . This is because highly processed foods require more energy input at each step and also often in handling and/or storage than products prepared at home from " scratch . " These energy relationships are just beginning to affect food ecology . Money available for food and the accoutrements of food service is another aspect of food ecology . For an individual , the money available for food determines choices among alternate items in the array of foods available for purchase , the frequency with which some items can be served , what quality is purchased , the level of physical defects tolerated , ttie degree of convenience that can be afforded , portion size , and so on . Money also determines the size and type of eating territory and the quality of its furnishings , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , all of these factors affect the perceived quality of the meal climate and eating experience and , hence , the affective component of man 's relationship to his food environment . Skills in food preparation , service , etc. , determine the items selected , whether ready-to-eat or prepared according to an elaborate ritual , the aesthetic qualities of the items , and their elaborateness . This in turn is important to the quality of the eating experience and the value accorded it Knowledge of food attributes , food composition , menu planning methods , food purchasing principles , food storage principles , food preservation  | methods , food preparation techniques , and food service methods determine what can be done with what one has to work with . Knowledge gives the power to compensate for lack of time , energy , and/or money , to some degree . Thus , knowledge has a major impact on food ecology . The quality of food and nutrition information sources used is also important . Access to scientific rather than food faddist explanations leads to different conclusions and actions . Quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceived as necessary to maintain health . Scientific information tends to take a conservative view that leads to moderate action , whereas food faddist sources tend to cause alarm and result in precipitate action . Any or all of these may be critical variables affecting the nutriture of an individual . Domestic Component The domestic component is composed of ( a ) those elements of the food supply/demand situation that control local food availability , ( b ) the culture-based food ideology and food practices , and ( c ) food/nutrition education and/or information sources . The overall relationships are sketched below and will be developed in subsequent chapters . Food production technology and capacity are important as they largely determine the types of food available for consumption , given consumer acceptability and preferences . Fruits , vegetables , and cereals available commercially are only a limited subset of the wild edible plants that may be used for food locally and/or nationally . Technological considerations , e.g. , ability to withstand the rigors of mechanical harvesting , limit the varieties selected . The number and kinds of animals that have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small . Technology has produced a controlled environment that enables a continuous supply of milk and eggs . The aggregate effect is a unique array of foods . The nature of items included and the supply of each determine the distribution of nutrients available from foods . Moreover , production efficiency has a major effect on price , which determines who can purchase what and how much . Thus , by adjusting food production technology and/or capacity , man can modify his relation to his food environment and his potential for adequate nutrient intake . Food processing technology and capacity largely control the nature and extent of preservation methods and preservatives used . In theory , the nutritive content of fresh foods exceeds that of preserved foods . In practice , while a reduction in nutritional value that varies with the food , the preservation method , and the nutrient can not be denied , fresh food can not be supplied countrywide , year-round at a reasonable price . So , processing to preserve is necessary . The net effect of increased and  | continuous supply is an improved potential for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual items is somewhat less . The use of preservatives retards or prevents some common kinds of deteriorative reactions . In some cases , the effect is to retard or to prevent destruction of particular nutrients and , in any case , to maintain the food in a condition fit for consumption , making its nutrients available . Food processing capacity makes highly processed foods available at a relatively low price , which determines who can purchase what and how much . The result is that man can modify his food environment so as to reduce the variability in the supply of nutrients . Food availability policies are manipulated to control food commodity prices . Policies limit , encourage , or channel food production . Policies of the following types are among the means used : subsidies for production of specific crops , intervention levels that allow production to a specified level , variable levies or charges , tariffs , import quotas , acreage quotas , price guarantees , export subsidies , land banks . Other policies limit , encourage , or channel consumer demand for food . Policies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice to the consumer on items that are plentiful ; price controls ; concessionary food programs for the young , pregnant , disabled , and elderly ; rationing ; public health legislation ; quality controls ; licensing laws ; consumer protection laws ; taxes on luxuries and duty on imports ; foreign aid ; and consumer subsidy to create new purchasing power . Thus , man can use food production and/or consumption policies to manipulate the supply and demand for food and , hence , food ecology . Food distribution /marketing technology and capacity are also factors that determine local item availability , demand , and prices . Distribution technology allows refrigerated shipment of perishable fresh foods and transport of frozen foods . Marketing technology entices people into the stores and encourages impulse buying . Availability in relation to demand determines the mark-up . Thus , man can affect this aspect of the food environment . Food control legislation encompasses food inspection , food additives , good manufacturing practices , food labeling , and food advertising . Food inspection procedures control the safety and wholesomeness of the food available . Food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor attributes , thus affecting quality and item choices made by the consumer . Good manufacturing practices followed within food processing plants assure nutrient conservation , wholesomeness , safety , and economy as well as control of air , heat , and water pollution . Controls on labeling are designed to aid the consumer in selecting appropriate foods to meet general and/or special dietary needs . Such legislation is designed to strengthen security while allowing for the level of choice that is necessary  | to self-esteem and self-actualization . Controls on food advertising are necessary to restrict claims while allowing product awareness to develop . All of these have important effects on food and people interactions . Generally accepted food-related beliefs underlie personal decisions in food purchasing , storage , and preparation . Some are based on fact , others on myths . But , all are controlling factors , usually learned from others in an effort to deal with the food environment in the common way . As a result , a common pattern develops . It is carefully monitored by the food industry . Usual food practices are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cases where nutrient supply and/or demand is altered by injury , infection , or malfunction . These include observable behaviors associated with food purchasing , food preparation , food service . These have a major impact on the food environment because they create/maintain/modify the aggregate demand for foods of various types , which in turn , results in marketing transactions , i.e. , create a new product , discontinue a product , modify a product , increase production control on a specific aspect of a product , augment or decrease the supply of a product , etc . Special food practices in relation to holidays , celebrations , and other social occasions reflect the status of man 's relation to his food environment , at a given time . When food is scarce and limited to a few items , then samples with few physical defects are presented with elaborate ritual , and thus , status is maintained . When food is generally abundant , high quality items and elaborate ritual are understood to be basic and emphasis tends to shift to rarity , costliness , and/or prodigality as means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a demand for fancy quality and specialty items . Paradoxically , in times of scarcity , the importance of these rituals increases and probably has a greater impact on man 's relation to his food environment than when food is abundant . This effect probably results from the fact that when food is scarce , it receives more attention and its relative importance increases . Thus , behaviors of individuals , such as hoarding and selectivity , become important in maintaining status , which is under pressure for other reasons . The aggregate effect is to inflate demand for scarce items . International Component The international component began to have a marked effect on the food environment of Americans in 1972 . At that time , the world food supply situation was transformed from one in which producer nations had surpluses and low food prices to one of relative scarcity and high  | prices . Prior to that time , American food giveaways of surplus foods had little effect on domestic availability and prices . However , when surpluses were reduced and other nations decided to purchase large quantities of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On top of this , the world food crisis developed and resulted in a crisis in confidence , a credibility gap , and widespread insecurity regarding the American food supply . These events have altered the perceived relat icon to the American food environment . It is now regarded as threatened . The food and people interaction is very complex . Its many components are under the control of world markets , national policies , commercial interests , and personal choice . Though these are operative at different levels , all are interdependent and the interaction among them shapes the nutritional outcomes for the American society and its individual members . LIFE EXPECTANCY Fundamentally , life expectancy or physiological survival depends on the supply of the right nutrients ( assortment and quantity ) on a continuous basis , all other things being equal . That is , consumption of a nutritionally adequate diet now and again or only some nutrients will not suffice . Nor can consumption of a nutritionally adequate diet overcome the lack of clothing or shelter nor the effects of mortal injury , infection , or organ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lived with a marginal quality of life which was in part due to inadequate food intake . Life expectancy for this segment always has been low , although in this century improved sanitation and medical assistance have improved life expectancy . At the same time , in every society there have been some rich people who were obese , but their general health was better and their life expectancy was greater . These people often suffered from what are now culled the degenerative diseases , namely heart disease , strokes , gout , and diabetes . Until lately , these diseases have been accepted as natural accompaniments of old age . Although these presented a threat , the threat was less immediate than the threat of starvation . Thus , people valued the good life , which was defined to include an abundance of food of ' ever-increasing quality and variety . Since hunting/gathering times , the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution have facilitated improvement in the lot of mankind . An ever-increasing proportion of people has consumed an adequate diet , and life expectancy has improved as has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in this century , the prevalence or number of cases of degenerative diseases has become a matter of increasing concern . Moreover , the incidence or number of new cases is growing as is the mortality rate , i.e. , the proportion of deaths in the population . The forces at work in American society have increased life expectancy to about 70 years . While life expectancy has been stable at this point for some years , there is increasing evidence that acute manifestations of degenerative diseases are occurring at increasingly younger ages . Although the causes are unclear , there is some evidence to implicate food intake . Therefore , various preventive diets have been advocated in order to retard or prevent development of the degenerative diseases and their threat to life expectancy . The opening paragraph raised some relevant questions . The answers are unknowable . Given current knowledge , some hypotheses and theories can be stated but in many cases we can only speculate , i.e. , give a reasoned explanation , since the answer is problematic . Consensus is reached in each generation on the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that emerges under the circumstances . Intervention programs to correct malnutrition must be implemented with care , since the implications and ramifications of such actions change man 's relation to his food environment and may have an impact on almost every other aspect of his existence .  | Why Do People Eat or Not Eat X ? At the personal level , food and people interactions in a society are related to ( a ) satisfaction of the basic human needs and ( b ) people 's beliefs concerning the proper relation to their food , which may reduce to a definition of which foods are suitable to eat under certain circumstances . This chapter examines generalizations that apply to the level(s) of satisfaction achieved by Americans as a people and/or its major subgroups . Discussion is organized according to the following topics : ( a ) implications of the food and people interaction ( b ) basic human needs and implications of satisfaction at various levels ( c ) hunger , surfeit , nutritional status , and individual potential ( d ) eating with safety and security ? the issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 0 religious functions of food ( g ) foods and nutrition : " Doing your own thing " The next chapter introduces concepts of individual intolerances and idiosyncrasies as related to food ideology . Then , the bases of subgroup beliefs are explored and the foodways of some of the major subgroups are described . These two chapters provide the foundation for understanding what you have when you have what you have , i.e. , the data collected as a basis for nutritional assessment . IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOOD AND PEOPLE INTERACTION The three levels of food and people interactions were indicated briefly in the previous chapter . At all levels , there is an on-going concern with adequacy of the food supply . The food supply would be adequate to meet t he needs of all people were it not for an anthropocentric view that creates defective and corrupt food and people interactions . The imposition of man 's will ( individual and collective ) on the food ecosystem can  | have unlooked-for effects . Since man is not all-knowing , mindless mistakes can be made . Ultimately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or mindful of this truth . Some effects at the personal and domestic levels have been discussed in previous chapters . Others pertaining to domestic and international levels are discussed in Chapter 32 . An assessment of an individual 's true position would include a status evaluation of all aspects of all components and their expected effects . But , to evaluate all of these prior to working with a given individual would be prohibitive in terms of time , energy , and money . Therefore , some generalizations with respect to critical variables have been developed for people in various situations . These are revised from time to time , as the need is recognized . The use of generalizations releases professional time . Attention is then focused on the quality of choices made by an individual . Alternatives that can help the individual improve food choices in relation to his/her food environment are suggested so as to achieve/ maintain the desired quality of life , all other things being equal . Before discussing some of the elements of American food and people interactions , a number of terms need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meaning that differs from the popular one . Important terms are : ( a ) Foodways ? This is a genus term referring to internalized beliefs and customary patterns of activities associated with acquisition , preparation , serving , consumption , and storage of food . It includes all relevant factors in the food and people interaction ? who , what , when , where , why , and how . ( b ) Food habits ? This is a species term referring to the practices associated with consumption of food , e.g. , the usual or customary items preferred and selected , the rituals of eating under variable circumstances , eating territory , eating times and frequency , meal climate . ( c ) Food ideology ? This is a species term referring to the beliefs and attitudes people have that determine their personal definition of food and their activities in relation to food , e.g. , - what people think about each of the different items that might be considered as food ; the sorting factors - what people think the effects of eating various " foods " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " foods " people think are suitable for individuals and categories of people , e.g. , old , infants , sick , pregnant , lactating - what kinds of " foods " people think are suitable at certain times , e.g. , one is not permitted to eat X from April to June ; it is poisonous - what kinds of " foods " people think are not suitable in certain conditions , e.g. , pregnant women are not permitted to eat X or the baby will have symptoms Y , Z , and Q The foodways of Americans are very diverse because the availability of foods is essentially unrestricted for most people ; freedom of choice is not limited arbitrarily . We are a nation of peoples from everywhere who have introduced many new items and variations of existing items , and we have free communication of food ideas , practices , etc . Nonetheless , the foodways of individuals and groups can be characterized at any given point in time according to similarities . Thus , anthropologists write long descriptions of beliefs , cooking pots and other utensils , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , food gifts , and the like . Statisticians prepare tables using descriptive statistics or measures of central tendency , i.e. , mean , median , mode , and percentage . Tables are interpreted with statements such as " The mean number of people preferring food item X is ... , " " Half the people of type X now eat dinner on TV trays in front of the television , " " The most frequent ( modal ) cut of meat purchased is X , followed by Y , " and " The percentage of people eating X on Friday is Y. "  | The foodways of individuals and groups can be compared at different points in time . The result is identification and documentation of variability or changes in foodways . Anthropologists and statisticians have techniques for characterizing the nature and extent of change . For this purpose they usually plot a trend . They may prepare a descriptive explanation , having identified the differences between two groups or among more than two groups . Another approach is to compare the effects of foodways to some standard , e.g. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many are close to the standard , and a few exceed it . Many alternate patterns of nutriture can be observed , depending on the nutrient under study and the age or other basis used for segmenting the group . American society has taken the position that professionals must intervene in the lives of those whose diet is not satisfactory nutritionally , whenever such cases come to their attention . A series of sorting factors for identifying the particular aspect(s) of the foodways of individuals and groups that will help one find the starting point for effective intervention has been developed . Three classes of variables are scrutinized routinely in making a dietary assessment . These are indicated here and are developed in Chapter 18 . The classes of variables are : ( a ) ingredient variables ? The personal array of ingredients and/or ready-to-eat items consumed customarily and occasionally is identified and evaluated . Tables of food composition are used to compute the mean intake of various nutrients . ( b ) environmental variables ? The differences in personal food habits and food ideology ( specific points ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then a big matrix of variables is construct- ed with age , income , education , etc. , as column headings and individual particulars in rows . ( c ) Individual variables ? The peculiarities of the foodways of an individual and/or known facts about particular biological needs that make the person vulnerable are identified and evaluated . All of the factors that create the diversity of foodways are operative simultaneously and there are many interaction effects . In order to make the points clear , each aspect will be discussed as though it were the only variable . That is , with all other things being equal , the effect is X. Though in reality , the effect may be magnified or negated and masked by other coexisting and operative patterns . BASIC HUMAN NEEDS AND IMPLICATIONS OF VARIOUS LEVELS OF SATISFACTION Above all else , the foodways of an individual are determined by his status in relation to satisfaction of basic human needs . A person at or near the subsistence level assigns top priority to food acquisition activities . Above this point , the expected priorities are unpredictable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Observed foodways often reveal some pattern that has developed as a result of the interactions , in the same way that personality develops . For the purposes of intervention foodways need to be reviewed and characterized . The first step is observation which should focus on obtaining a definition of where the person is at , at a specific point in time , in regard to satisfaction of the basic needs ; the description should be recorded . Then assessment of food ecology or the individual 's relation to his particular food environment will provide meaningful detail . The elements of food ecology to be assessed and associated considerations and procedures will be described in Chapters 17 through 21 . Apparent inconsistency between observed food habits and expected food habits , given expressed food ideology , often can be explained by some problem in satisfying one or more of the basic human needs at some level . The problem may be one of frustration because of inability to satisfy . Or , the problem may be one of conflict between competing but equally important needs . In this case , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is internal war . Ultimately , a trade-off or compromise is reached . The conflicting points are rejected by a process called rationalization , and internal harmony is restored . Once this point is reached , seemingly inconsistent behavior disappears .  | Basic Human Needs In 1943 , Maslow ( 1943 ) identified the basic human needs as physiological , safety-security , love or belongingness , esteem or status , and self-actualization . Maslow , in discussing the motivations of people in satisfying these needs , made a number of points that are fundamental to an understanding of the food and people interaction . In general , all human activity is organized to satisfy one or more of these needs , at some level . Generally , these needs can be arranged in a hierarchy at their lowest level of satisfaction ; above the minimum , other considerations take priority . What this means is that , when it comes right down to it , the highest priority of all is physiological survival . People will eat anything that they perceive might provide nourishment . A person is occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And , the definition includes anything that the person perceives will supply nutrients to meet physiological demand . But , as soon as enough " food " is supplied to meet the demand for nutrients and assure survival , man becomes concerned with safety-security considerations . A person is then occupied with the problem of the distinction between " food " and " poison " in relation to health . The result is that the definition of " food " is restricted to those items that are least associated with illness , i.e. , those that appear to be least poisonous and reliably non-toxic . At the same time , man is occupied with problems of storing food for future use , i.e. , to provide some security . Food classification and beliefs begin to form . When this distinction has been made and a person is secure with regard to the safety and stores of food , he then becomes concerned with lovehelongingness considerations . A person is then occupied with the problem of defining what is OK/NOT OK to eat from a socio-cultural standpoint . The result is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those it ems accepted by the local peer group . The definition of what is " poison " is expanded to include unfamiliar or strange items and proscribed items . Observation will quickly identify who is in the " in " group and who is in the " out " group . The process of food classification and development of belief structures continues . When these basic needs have been met , man becomes concerned with esteem or status . A person is then occupied with the problem of defining What is food ? on an economic basis . This is an important consideration its it has a major impact on variety . The definition of what is " poison " is expanded to include inexpensive low quality items and items " given " in charity to those less fortunate .  | When these needs have been met , man becomes concerned with selfactualization which is the process of establishing a personal identity . A person is then occupied with the problem of defining What is food ? in terms of style that becomes a trademark . This is often an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition of " food " to combinations that are harmonious in color , texture , and shape . The definition of " poison " may imply lack of harmony or it may connote monotony . A dinner of steamed chicken , mashed potatoes , and cauliflower on a white plate is deemed poisonous for this reason . Implications Above the minimum level of satisfaction , there is the potential of a continuous distribution of levels or gradations in satisfaction of each of these needs . The basic needs can never really be satisfied . This has both fortunate and unfortunate implications . It is fortunate as it allows flexibility in the food and people interaction and thereby permits healthy adjustment to changing circumstances . Elusiveness is also unfortunate as some individuals become compulsively obsessed with seeking continuous improvement in one aspect or another . There is more to life than this . IF one can get beyond obsession with pursuit of improvement , THEN satisfaction is not that important and is easily attained at a reasonable level . For each individual , there is a characteristic band of expected levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of self-concept and life-style . These motivate control of activity to assure expected satisfaction , to the extent possible . Within this characteristic band , there is some minor shifting up and down according to immediate considerations . A shift outside this band requires great adjustment . A shift down is traumatic and results in feelings of deprivation . For example , this occurs with every sharp price rise when some items are eliminated or served less frequently . A shift up implies that life is improving . It is accompanied by feelings of insecurity over appropriateness of choices at the new level , unless the shift was slight . For every individual , the priorities for satisfaction of the basic needs are in a continuous state of change in response to internal and external forces . Any force which causes a shift in level of satisfaction of one need may result in a chain of responses involving any or all of the other needs . From the above , it is clear that observable behaviors are a result of many interactions . Although the same food behaviors may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and integrations . The change agent must be aware of this fact since strategies for change must be based on the causes , not the observable behaviors. // HUNGER , SURFEIT , NUTRITIONAL STATUS AND INDIVIDUAL POTENTIAL  | The top priority need is to assure physiological survival . Too little or too much food can be life-threatening as will be discussed in this section . At the very least too much or too little food tends to modify individual potential . Before discussing the issues , a few terms will be defined . ( a ) Hunger is a sensation occasioned by lack of food and results in a craving or urgent need for food or a specific nutrient . ( b ) Surfeit refers to an overabundant supply of food , i.e. , an excess or an intemperate /immoderate indulgence in food or drink , e.g. , by a glutton. ( c ) Nutritional status refers to the state of supply of an assortment of about 50 nutrients , in some known ratio and quantity , at a particular time in relation to expected metabolic demand . ( d ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ratio and quantity ) is adjusted continuously to meet expected metabolic demand . ( e ) Malnutrition means inadequate or inappropriate supply in relation to expected demand , i.e. , right nutrients in the wrong ratio , right nutrients but supply is erratic , wrong nutrients ? miss one or more , or wrong nutrients ? supply is so high that it poisons the system . Nutritional status is related to health . Health has been defined in the preamble to the WHO constitution as " . a state of complete physical , mental , and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity . " Health is directly affected by injury , infection , and malfunction of organs and systems and indirectly by nutritional status . Nutritional status is an environmental factor that affects the body 's ability to deal with injury , infection , and/or malfunction . If nutritional status is good , then effects can be reduced , i.e. , a fast return to good health is possible or minimal problems result . If nutritional status is not good , then the effects are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health . Herein lies the importance of good nutrition . As people always have known , a person who is chronically hungry is nearly always poorly nourished . A person who is surfeited traditionally has been considered to be well nourished . However , in the past 20 years , accumulated evidence supports the position that surfeit also results in malnutrition , but of a different kind . Thus , the problem of physiological survival is still a relevant issue . Hunger Hunger is not an all or none variable . Rather , it is continuous in degree from not very hungry to very hungry . Basically , hunger is related to  | physiologic need but the appetite response is unreliable . Everybody becomes hungry at intervals during the day , but responses vary among people ( both in terms of quality and quantity of food consumed ) along a continuum . Some people tune out the signals ; they become hungrier and temporarily undernourished . Some people accept the signals but delay action ; they often become hungrier to a point and then overreact . Some people accept the signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overreact . Hence , the nutritional outcomes vary and the signals may cease , continue at a low level , or increase in intensity . A person also can override the physiological signals because of other needs . And , in some cases physiological need will take over at the subconscious level , resulting in uncontrollable cravings . A pattern of behavior usually associated with simple starvation has been observed in milder form in persons who are temporarily hungry , such as dieters . If the pattern is present , then it must be dealt with before any progress can be made in dealing with other needs . According to Maslow ( 1943 ) , in the case of simple starvation , . . . all other needs may become simply non-existent or be pushed into the background ... For the man who is simply and dangerously hungry , no other interest exists but food . He dreams food , he remembers food , he emotes only about food , he perceives only food ... Utopia can be defined very simply as a place where there is plenty of food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guaranteed food for the rest of his life , he will be perfectly happy and will never want anything else . ' But , it turns out as soon as some food is obtained which partially satisfies hunger , then the person 's scale of values changes ? quality or variety becomes important or some other physiological or other need takes priority . Hunger also is related to the safety-security need . In general , an emotional-psychological crisis resulting from a threat to safety-security results in a depressed appetite in the short-run . This occurs because the fright-fight-flight response is to release adrenalin in order to deal with the crisis . The effect is to shunt blood from the stomach and intestines to heart and muscles . If a person were to eat at this time , absorption would bottleneck since the blood flow for distribution of nutrients would be reduced . The result is anorexia , nausea , and cramps . In general , in chronic cases of emotional-psychological crisis and after a discrete event , a person will experience hunger pangs and increased appetite . Originally , the fright-fight-flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was then necessary to replenish energy stores . Emotional-psychological balance is necessary and people eat to symbolically replenish stores .  | Hunger also is related to the love - belongingness need . People who are lonely feel unwanted and ill at ease . They often do not eat except when invited out to dinner . Usually they subsist on tea and toast rather than meals . Hunger or lack of hunger may result from frustration in obtaining status . People may be observed to eat to excess or to refuse food in order to gain attention , which increases status , in a sense . Strength and integrity of food ideology may stimulate or suppress hunger pangs . Those who eat by the clock do so because they believe that they should eat regularly . The same type of person who does not eat enough at one time may suppress hunger pangs until " mealtime " as determined by the clock . Food beliefs are not that important to most Americans . So , if a person is very hungry , he/she probably will eat whatever is available , all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry , then behavior is unpredictable . Many people are hungry . The May 6 , 1969 Message of the President to the Congress of the United States ( Nixon 1970B ) includes this passage : ... in the past few years we have awakened to the distressing fact that despite our material abundance and agricultural wealth , many Americans suffer from malnutrition . Precise factual descriptions of its extent are not presently available , but there can be no doubt that hunger and malnutrition exist in America , and that some millions may be affected . Real hunger or food deprivation of sufficient extent and duration to result in medical cases of malnutrition usually are seen only in populations at marginal levels of subsistence . At least that was the consensus of opinion at the time . So , where did the President obtain information that caused him to make the above statement ? In 1969 , the documentary film " Hunger in America " was shown in prime time on major TV networks . It showed hunger in Appalachia among coal mining families , hunger among Native Americans living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rural areas and in city slums . It showed the hungry to be young , old , pregnant women , the employed as well as the unemployed . Documentation was comprehensive and unequivocal ; the point was irrefutable and unavoidable ? in affluent America , real hunger exists . The resultant shock waves were of sufficient magnitude that they could not be ignored . A White House Conference was called , resulting in some corrective legislation . In 1969 , in appointing Jean Mayer to organize the White House Conference on Food , Nutrition and Health , the President said ( Nixon 1970A ) In calling the White House Conference on Food , Nutrition , and Health , we are loth reaffirming our commitment to a full and healthful diet for all Americans  | and exploring what we yet need to know and do to achieve that goal . The White House Conference came and went . There was much talk and some immediate food aid . " Bread now " was the concept . But , man must eat every day , not just now and again . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , public opinion is fickle and shifts from one crisis to another . So , when budgets were juggled because of the next political exigency , feeding programs turned out to be approved but not funded . So , things have not changed . " The poor are with us " always . " And , poverty results in food deprivation and concomitant malnutrition . Surfeit Surfeit is not an all or none condition . It is a matter of degree and is the antithesis of hunger . Basically , surfeit is related to lack of physiological need for food . Here again , the appetite is an unreliable guide . Some people ignore the response and make themselves sick by overeating . Others accept the signal but delay action , continuing to eat mindlessly . These people have no will power and become obese . Some are easily satisfied and eat too little . In contemporary American society , availability of an abundant supply coupled with too little will power has led to development of the degenerative diseases . Prevalence is so high that a health crisis exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body stores of the various nutrients are highly variable . Since the reserve supply of some nutrients is small , they are critical to survival . The available evidence suggests that carbohydrate , potassium , sodium , and water are most critical , in that order . Normally , symptoms of deprivation of these have an acute onset and degeneration toward death is rapid . Consequently , man has learned to supply these and warning is passed among generations via folk tales and adages . Fat and protein are the next most critical nutrients . Deprivation results in protein-energy malnutrition ( PEM ) . This condition is seen among people of all ages , but most often among pre-school children . Thiamin is the next most critical nutrient . It is a class representative , which means that it stands for all of the B vitamins except B12 . The expected effect of deprivation is similar for all since they all function as coenzymes . IF a low level of intake is maintained , THEN stores can be //  | built to a limited extent that provides short-term reserve . IF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron , vitamin A , and calcium are usually adequate for years . But , we hear of much anemia , and of deficiencies of vitamin A and calcium . Why ? There are many causes of blood loss and iron intake is frequently low . Vitamin A is distributed unevenly in foods and not in the foods that are inexpensive and filling . So , people must select for it by conscious action and many do not . Deprivation of calcium in early childhood prevents normal storage so children have limited reserves and thereby become vulnerable . Development of a deficiency syndrome in an adult indicates real hunger of months ' to years ' duration , since stores are normally adequate . Stores of ascorbic acid are diffuse . Nutritionists recommend a daily intake . Why ? Ascorbic acid is not stored in any great quantity . Therefore , it must be supplied frequently . But , supply must not be left to chance . Since people forget or can not get organized , it is more convenient to recommend a daily intake . Other nutrients are not listed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extent , but the quantities are small . In most cases , IF a variety of natural foods is consumed , THEN intake will be alright . In summary , severe malnutrition is expected only when people are really hungry because of chronic food deprivation . IF it occurs during the period when brain tissue is developing , THEN development may be impaired . Otherwise , misery rather than great harm is the likeliest outcome . Suboptimal nutriture also can affect individual potential because performance is likely to be lower with consequent reduction in opportunities . Individual Potential Nutrition is a science and much is known about the general human physiological demand for a specific array of nutrients under certain conditions . But , we can not know how much of a specific nutrient is needed by a specific individual at a specific time . This is unknowable . Some general concepts of what is wanted , given genetic and environmental factors , have emerged from extensive controlled investigations . There is a basal metabolic demand that is determined by genetic potential . This is the amount needed to sustain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual bioefficiency . It varies among people with race , sex with respect to size-and-shape-related distributions , and age ? older people have lower proportions of functioning cells so require less . In addition , there is a demand that is determined by growth and development status according to a biological time clock . Growth and/or devel- opment inflates the need for all nutrients , for some more than others depending on the nature and extent of growth and/or development ill process . For example , infants have a small body size but their growth rate is steep so demands are relatively high . Teenagers have attained or are in the process of attaining maximum body size . Basal metabolic need is high and growth and/or development is rapid so the demand is inflated to a very high level . Adults have attained a large body size so basal metabolic need is high . But , since growth has stopped , overall demand is only moderate . In pregnancy body size is large and growing so the basal demand is high . Growth of maternal and fetal tissues is steep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over and above these physiological needs for nutrients are needs created by various environmental factors . Physical activity is the first of these . Physical activity results in wear and tear on the tissues in addition to the need for fuel . For example , infants have relatively high needs because activity during waking hours is practically incessant . Adults , who in our society are practically sedentary , may have no need above their basal metabolic need . Use of drugs , whether over-the-counter or prescription , inflates the need for some nutrients but not much is known about such effects . It is known that oral contraceptive agents ( OCA ) inflate the needs for B , , nicotine inflates the need for ascorbic acid , and aspirin inflates the need for iron . If a person takes any drugs routinely , then serum levels of various nutrients should be monitored . However , the effects of many drugs on nutritional need are unknown . In general , nutrient demand is correlated with stage in the life cycle . For this reason , statements of guidelines are related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs at least at five-year intervals . To avoid mistakes , one automatically could review needs each time the new Recommended Dietary Allowances are published . Individual potential for performing optimally , given genetic potential , is related to nutritional status . Deficiency in the supply of each of the nutrients is related to slowdown or cessation of some necessary metabolic activity . Marginal intake leads to minor stress and vague symptoms . Major deficiency results in a major stress , development of pathological conditions , and if prolonged , death . Excess in supply of each of the various nutrients is related to problems of flooding , resulting in storage and/ or poisoning problems . A chronic marginal excess causes a minor problem . A major chronic excess results in a major stress , pathological conditions , and/or death . Thus , it turns out that a person must determine his/her personal level of need , adjust intake to supply it , and continue that supply level in order to facilitate productivity according to potential .  | EATING WITH SAFETY AND SECURITY : THE ISSUES From time immemorial , problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern of society . Since the beginning of recorded history , the same issues have confronted mankind . In this sense , there is nothing new in this world , but there may be a new twist for the current generation to solve . The problems for the individual involve trust in others and personal food intolerance or allergies that create special individual problems . The problems for society are : ( a ) What is naturally edible or can be processed so as to become edible ? ( b ) What is perishable and what can be stored as is or if processed to preserve ? ( c ) When food is obtained from others , what procedures can be used to control the nature and extent of defects that result from ignorance or negligence so as to be sure that the food is wholesome ? ( d ) When food is obtained from others , what procedures can be developed to prevent/protect it from adulteration or fraud ? ( e ) What procedures can be established to control the problem of poisoning out of malice for political reasons ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence in the safety and wholesomeness of the food supply ? Between 1900 and the mid-1930s , the major issues were problems with standards , control of defects which until then had been accepted as natural , and adulteration . These problems were solved effectively for the time being . The controls were so effective that people became secure and complacent . Businessmen knew their businesses and there seemed to be adequate laws to control and protect , for the level of problems that existed at that time . City people were not exposed to natural toxicants . The array of domesticated plants is small compared to natural variety , but people had access only to domesticated plants so the problem of natural toxicants was minimal . The pesticides and food additives used were few and easily detected because the technology was not that advanced . But , since about 1970 Americans have been insecure with regard to the safety and supply of basic foodstuffs . Why ? The true explanations are unknowable . A plausible explanation is offered for consideration . Edibility may have become an important issue because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ingredients in their long , impossible-to-pronounce chemical names . This might be expected to evoke a response of fear of the unknown . It may be that the change was too abrupt . The general public previously had not been educated to regard foods as mixtures of chemicals . Understandably , many people may have  | rejected this concept as unacceptable . If so , an expected outcome would be that out of fear and/or ignorance they would reject the foods with the chemical names for common ingredients . In this case , label information may have been the only aspect that changed with respect to the food , but beliefs would cause rejection . So , questions of safety were raised and people became insecure . Edibility also became an issue because new sophisticated processing techniques were introduced . People are no longer involved in processing their own food . And , they fear the unknown . Food processing is accomplished by the food processing industry , and an impersonal unknown " they " are not trusted by many people . So , again out of fear and/or ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety were raised and another segment of the American population became insecure . Perishability became an important issue because new intermediate moisture foods that are shelf-stable were introduced . From television and other sources , the consumer learned that perishability was not a problem . These items look and taste like their traditional counterparts , which is the cause of the problem that developed . Sometimes the traditional items were purchased and handled in the new way ; these items spoiled . Confusion resulted , questions of safety were raised , and people became insecure . The problem of too many defects became an important issue because foods are biological materials and are inherently highly variable . Many consumers did not know this since neither they nor any relatives were any longer involved in agriculture . So , consumers expected too much uniformity and perfection . When people became aware of food product recalls for reasons of defects they panicked ( Fig. 15.1 ) . And , when prices went up , they bought less expensive substitutes , found unaccustomed defects , and responded with " What are you trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of safety , and became insecure . The problems of adulteration and fraud became an issue because sophisticated technology , using a large array of food additives , evolved . The food processor has been confronted with an increasing demand for product control during processing , delivery , and home storage by the consumer . The solution was manipulation of product attributes by controlled use of food additives ( Fig. 15.2 ) . But , nearly all of these food additives , when listed by chemical name , resulted in fear of the unknown . Moreover , the average consumer is not technically competent to understand why each food additive is used . Plausible and acceptable explanations usually have not been made , so the consumer concluded that either adulteration or fraud was intended . So , questions of safety were raised again and people became even more insecure .  | The problem of poisoning out of malice or for political reasons has become an issue because sophisticated technology allows us to measure chemicals in parts per billion ( p.p.b . ) . The question of natural contaminant versus deliberate low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So people are anxious and insecure . To top it all off , when crop short-falls abroad resulted in elimination of our surpluses from storage , the problem of possible death by starvation became an important issue . People became aware that greed and politics resulted in grain sales that depleted stores . At the same time , people became aware of the population explosion , and they became aware of waste on a grand scale . All in all , people became insecure regarding supply . In this country , which has the best agricultural productivity the world has ever known , some people have become afraid of death by starvation . See Chapters 32 and 33 for additional detail . The wave of insecurity and lack of confidence in the safety of American foods was not confined to processed food . Techniques that enabled detection of substances in p.p.b. revealed the presence of pesticides , known poisons , in raw agricultural commodities . In the wake of this revelation , the " organic " foods movement was born . Organic foods are purported to be raw agricultural commodities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foodstuffs processed without the use of food chemicals or food additives . Thus , they are " pure " foods .  | Organic food stores opened throughout the land to cater to the needs of those who had to have organic foods . Some sell fancy grade produce or staples and assert that the superior quality is a direct outcome of the ecologically sound organic farming methods . Others sell substandard produce or staples . Natural defects such as apple scabs and worms , uneven color , or rancidity are accepted as evidence that the food is organically grown . Still others sell the same quality of items obtained from the same suppliers as the local supermarkets . In any case , organic food stores customarily charge " what the traffic will bear . " Table 15.1 lists comparative prices . IF the assurance of safety and security derived from the label " organically grown " is sufficient to allay unreasonable fears , THEN such food and the peace of mind it creates is probably worth the price to the true believer .  | Wherever people meet , either informally or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering , i.e. , the sharing of food and/or drink , in the social situation serves as a unifying force with the functions of expressing love/friendship or belongingness/acceptance , status , hospitality , and celebration . Foodways are associated with each of these functions . In this context , foodways refer to the habits and beliefs of the group that reflect the way in which that culture standardizes behavior of the individual members of the group , in relation to food . As a group , Americans have developed certain foodways which form an identifiable pattern in terms of what is considered appropriate for picnics , pool parties , barbecues , teas , or brunches . Within American society , foodways of local social groups determine the who , what , when , where , why , and how of the food and people interaction . The connotations of eating or not eating , in regard to social acceptance , vary with the situation . In the most common social eating situations , the functions of expressing love/friendship or belongingness/acceptance , status , and hospitality can not be separated . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A neighbor , a friend , a salesman admitted to the home ? by tradition all of these are immediately offered some sweet and/or rich item and a beverage , even if the visit is unexpected . Appropriate items must be kept can hand against such an emergency ; failure in this regard is embarrassing and decreases status . Failure to offer food and/or beverage usually implies flouting of custom and results in loss of status . To refuse an item offered is considered bad manners and implies rejection of friendship and results in loss of status . If for reasons of health , one can not accept the item(s) offered , one feels obligated to apologize ; nonetheless , the situation is awkward . If the timing of the visit is very close to a mealtime , non-acceptance of food and/or beverage may be alright but timing of the visit may be considered inappropriate and may be resented . Food and/or drink is served as a planned but minor part of most meetings , except dinner meetings where it is more important . Usually , to refuse food is unacceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join a group after a meal just prior to the speaker . This alternative avoids the necessity for consumption of unwanted food , but is still not entirely acceptable socially . Food and drink are a major part of social get-togethers such as teas , bridge parties , picnics , and ball games . If one anticipates that he/she will not be able to eat the type of food likely to be served , then the invitation usually is not accepted . To attend the function and refuse the food would be conspicuous and socially unacceptable behavior . The type of food served on social occasions tends to be rich and/or sweet empty-calorie foods in keeping with the concept of generosity . Those individuals whose life-style involves frequent social eating become obese unless they compensate . One way to compensate is by selecting the best alternative item . Another is to eat slowly and leave a portion or at least to avoid additional portions . Another strategy is reduced eating at other times . The major difficulty is that the nutrient density of foods consumed socially is low . Supplementation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intake . Traditionally , American women have expressed love of family through careful selection , preparation , and service of meals . Accordingly , disparaging remarks about food are tabooed as bad manners . At the same time , a compliment expresses love in a socially acceptable way . Love also is expressed through the system of rewards and punishments . In this sense , to publicly withhold food is equivalent to withdrawing love and social acceptance . This is a powerful means of applying social sanction . Food gifts signify love/friendship and are universal symbols used for this purpose . A gift of wine is used to exchange for a meal . A gift of candy is expected at Valentines Day . Fudge , brownies , and special foods are prepared to strengthen relationships . A homemade food gift is offered as  | a " labor of love " and carries the message that " I care enough to use my time and talents to do this for you . " Belongingness/acceptance also is expressed by invitations to participate in social eating situations . Persons with reputations as gracious hostesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share Thanksgiving , Christmas , and other group dinners . Status and social acceptance also are related . Newspaper gossip columns carry remarks about who was " seen " and therefore accepted as having sufficient status to belong to the " right " crowd . Invitations to " hundred-dollar- a-plate dinners " carry much status . Serving of food and beverages has a central role in expressing hospitality with its implication of generosity . In this context , even the humblest of families shares their best food with guests . In fact , since other means are limited , food assumes greater importance . Indeed , it may be the social binder . More affluent families augment hospitality with a status-giving prodigal array of foods . Overeating and its sequelae are expected outcomes . Food and drink play a well recognized role in celebration . Individuals celebrate special occasions of personal significance with culturally determined foods that have been assigned symbolic value by convention . For example , raises and promotions are celebrated with dinner out including wine and/or champagne , and birthdays are celebrated with cake and ice cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The women 's magazines present new variations of traditional items and/or combinations each year . Thus , while turkey and cranberries are expected at Thanksgiving , the cranberries will be included in the different meal components from soup to nuts , e.g. , one year a cranberry relish will be the rage and another a cranberry crunch . Social acceptance limits freedom to choose . For example , consider the following situation . Three women enter a restaurant for lunch . As soon as the menu is presented , somebody mumbles her choice aloud . IF she selects a salad plate luncheon , THEN companions usually will select similarly light meals . In all probability , nobody will select the featured complete meal of entree , vegetable , salad , and dessert . To do so would break an unwritten social rule . FOOD AND ESTEEM : FREEDOM TO CHOOSE Esteem was listed by Maslow ( 1943 ) as the fourth level need . To esteem means to have great regard for , to value highly , to respect . All of these imply status . High status is attributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . American society teaches people to value freedom of choice . Consequently , self-esteem and the esteem of others  | are related to the number and kinds of alternatives available to an individual . In American society money , rather than birth , is the basis for social position . Celebrations associated with the rites of passage always have been used to emphasize status differences . Also , conspicuous consumption has been the prerogative of those of high birth . But , in affluent America it is practiced by peoples of various levels . So , having money is not enough . It must be spent in socially acceptable ways . One of these is to purchase exotic expensive food and drink and/or serve it lavishly and conspicuously . Operationally , status functions by accentuating the differences between the giver and the receiver . Suitable food gifts from high status people are extra quantities of deluxe items or strange and costly items . The relationship between status and freedom of choice is that IF one has high status by means of being rich and/or famous , THEN one has a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not have high status , THEN one can make a showing and pretend , at least temporarily . The freedoms that status confers and that are emulated by others include : ( a ) Freedom to choose rare and costly items with which to impress ethers . ( When we go to C 's house , she serves X ! We accept invitations from C since they increase our status and we can impress others by relating the fact that we went to C 's house and had X ! ) ( b ) Freedom to select expensive restaurants , costly wines , and other luxury items for personal gratification . ( When we switch from place A to place B or Brand A to Brand B , peers infer that we must be coming up in this world since these are more costly alternatives. ) ( c ) Freedom to prepare an especially difficult or time-consuming dish . In addition to facilitating achievement of status in others ' eyes , freedom to choose also provides the means for increasing self-esteem . For example : ( a ) Freedom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can afford X more often than anybody else in my group . Therefore , I feel good about myself. ) ( b ) Freedom to eat in restaurants , a more expensive alternative than c+ating a comparable meal at home . ( I can afford to eat at place X or I can afford to eat at place X more often than previously . Therefore , I feel good about myself . I am coming up in this world. ) ( c ) Freedom to prepare X , which is difficult and time-consuming and which my neighbors or friends love but can not produce . ( I can choose to make X for them because I have the skill . Then I can show off and feel good about myself . ) Lack of power to choose decreases self-esteem . The poverty problem is a case in point , whether people " feel poor " or are poor . IF people have less  | food purchasing power than usual or than others around them have , THEN they feel deprived . They become envious and the value of some items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars to obtain X. Then , having obtained it , they may be able to endure the usual food for some time . When it is impossible to obtain X , the result is less variety by elimination of a coveted item . Sometimes the result is apathy and rejection of customary food , accompanied by an attitude of not caring whether any food is consumed . The therapeutic diet problem is another case of deprivation . People feel restricted and their behavior reflects this . Some people accept or go along with the restriction . But , they fail to compensate in the food and people interaction so the total value of each meal is depreciated . After awhile , the diet is not followed . Some people can not accept the lack of freedom , so reject the diet as impossible . These people regard physical discomfort . as the lesser of two evils . Institutions such as schools and hospitals often use a set or no-choice menu . Even when the food is acceptable , complaints arise due to lack of choice . Another example is commonly observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a forced choice between two unacceptable alternatives such as lamb and liver . The problem arises because when such items are paired , they result in a no-choice situation for many people . Even when two equally popular items are paired , there may be resentment due to the problem of choice and the fact that the next pair is unlikely to be as good a choice . RELIGIOUS FUNCTIONS OF FOOD ( RELATED TO RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND OBSERVANCES ) Freedom of religion is a constitutional right in the United States . More than 500 sects have taken advantage of this freedom and have become established . These have been grouped as follows : ( a ) The Liturgical Family ( Western or Roman Catholic and Episcopal ) ( b ) The Liturgical Family ( Eastern Orthodox and Non-Chalcedonian Orthodox ) ( c ) The Lutheran Family ( d ) The Reformed Presbyterian Family ( Presbyterian and Congrega-tional ) ( e ) The Liberal Family ( Unitarian ) ( f ) The Pietist-Methodist Family ( e.g. , Moravian , Methodist ) ( g ) The Holiness Family ( e.g. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ h ) The Pentecostal Family ( e.g. , Church of God , Pentecostal ) ( i ) The European Free-Church Family ( e.g. , Mennonite , Amish , Breth- 0 ) The Baptist Family ( Baptist and Church of Christ ) ( k ) The **26;917;TOOLONG Family ( Plymouth Brethren , Grace Gospel Fellowship ) ( 1 ) The Adventist Family ( Seventh Day Adventist , Church of God , sacred name churches , Jehovah 's Witnesses ) ( m ) The Latter-Day Saints Family ( n ) The Communal Family ( e.g. , Amana , Shakers ) ( o ) The Metaphysical Family ( e.g. , Christian Science ) ( p ) The Psychic and New Age Family ( e.g. , spiritualist churches , theosophy societies , the " I Am " movement , Rosicrucians , cosmic wisdom groups , Church of Scientology , ECKANKAR ) ( q ) The Magic Family ( witchcraft , neo-paganism , satanism ) ( r ) The Eastern and Middle Eastern Family ( Judaism , Islam , Hinduism , Sikhism , Jainism , Buddhism ) ( s ) The New Unaffiliated Religious Bodies ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dietary laws , awareness is essential so as to avoid giving offense . A simple case in point is when one party believes that to refuse food is to deny friendship when no such thing is intended by the other party , who may have no inkling of this belief . Moreover , when some refuse to eat there may be good reason for it . Adherents of many smaller religious groups have been taught that others do not understand and that they should not take offense when their religious scruples are ignored . Their coping mechanism is to withdraw and not eat rather than create a scene by requesting special food . At this time in the United States , life is very secularized , and many people are only nominal Jews , Christians , Buddhists , etc . Even among adherents to the various religions , strength of belief and observance in practice is highly variable . Contemporary city territories and styles are informal and do not support religious observances . A religion that is viable grows and evolves . As long as adherents give credence to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the right spirit . When they are disillusioned , it loses meaning and observance degenerates through erosion to detachment ( pro forma observance ) to separation ( non-observance ) . In general , new converts are likely to be more zealous in observance than those who are raised in the faith . Thus , strength of belief and importance of adherence must be ascertained before implementing a diet or feeding program . Spontaneous interpretations and revelations introduce new precepts that wax and wane . Over the centuries , splinter groups retaining the old or following the new break away from the main group . Thus , many versions coexist under the umbrella of a particular family of religions . No attempt has been made to identify all of the versions , since more than 500 are practiced in the United States .  | A common religious belief is that people are capable of perfection and are responsible for choosing between right and wrong . Food is of fundamental importance in sustaining the physical body and is consumed several times a day , so it is a suitable vehicle for nourishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying grace ; ( b ) demonstrating faith through acceptance and observance of scriptural directions with respect to what may be consumed as food , what might otherwise be consumed as food but is detrimental to health , and the spirit with which food is to be consumed ; and ( c ) developing discipline via fasting . Observable behaviors with respect to choice of kind , quality , and amount of food consumed as well as food and people interactions also reflect obedience to and application of particular church dogmas . The subsequent discussion identifies similarities and differences among various religions , to the extent possible , given variability in the comprehensiveness of materials provided by the various churches . All religions appear to have originally incorporated a belief that the provision of food involves some relation with the divine . However , in some of the older religions , only vestiges of the belief and means of observance remain . Christians have been provided with a scriptural admonition ( 1 Cor. 10:31 ) : Whether therefore ye eat , or drink , or whatsoever ye do , do all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the basic rule . All others are subsumed and provide specific guidance for dealing with particular positions which people always have taken that place an undesirable strain on food and people interactions . Some Christian sects recognize and promote the ideal of religious liberty in a sense that precludes an official position or guidance with respect to social habits , diet , and domestic customs . Practices and avoidances involving food and people interactions are an individual matter . Churches with this persuasion include , but are not limited to , Baptist , Congregational , and Methodist . Communication with God A blessing is a short prayer said before a meal to ask God to bestow his favor on those assembled in order that the food might nourish the participant 's body . A grace is a short prayer said at the close of a meal to express thankfulness or to acknowledge God 's hand in what has been provided as a source of nourishment . Judaism , Islam , and Christianity have a precedent in a song of praise ( Psalm 145:15 ) :  | The eyes of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in due season . ( KJV ) ' Both a blessing and a grace create a meal climate that affects the tone of the food and people interactions . When a sacrilegious grace such as " Rub-a-dub-dub , thanks God for the grub , " is said , the tone of the meal tends to be light and joking ; barbed , critical remarks about the food and/or cook are not uncommon . When a heartfelt grace is said , those who partake of the meal usually are more restrained and will refrain from disparaging remarks about the food and/or cook . Other aspects of table conversation are similarly constrained . Moreover , there is incentive to avoid misuse of the food provided . Thus , overindulgence , waste by taking more than can be consumed , and " pickiness " are less likely . The practice of asking a blessing or saying grace is practiced alone and in public by Jews , Protestants of all sects , Roman Catholics , Eastern Orthodox , Mormons , and Muslims . The custom of offering a blessing by Jews and Christians is documented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might find him in a certain place on the day of sacrifice . ( 1 Sam . 9:13 ) ... for the people will not eat until he comes , because he doth bless the sacrifice ; and afterwards they eat that be bidden . ( KJV ) The model for behavior of Christians is contained in Acts 27:35 : And when he had thus spoken , he took bread , and gave thanks to God in presence of them all ; and when he had broken it , he began to eat . ( KJV ) Demonstration of Faith Sharing of food to indicate a bond of friendship is an old JudeoChristian tradition , as recorded in scripture ( 11 Sam . 9:7 , 10 , 11 , 13 ) . Similarly , to refuse food was an indication of anger ( 1 Sam . 20:34 ) . Both aspects are recognized today . Churches in which fellowship and the interpersonal bond of love is strong emphasize this aspect . This is characteristic of Islam , Jehovah 's Witnesses , Judaism , the Lutheran Family , Mormons , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scriptural references are numerous . For Christians , the specific scriptural references specify that hospitality is to be extended only to fellow Christians ( 1 Pet . 1:9 and 11 John 9-11 ) .  | The custom of giving food gifts to gain or ensure the goodwill of another is an old Judaic custom . It puts the receiver under obligation to observe peaceful relations . Scriptural examples are 1 Sam . 25:18 , 19 , and 1 Ki. 14:1-3 . Gathering of relatives to partake of a common meal is one function recognized by many religious sects , including Catholic , Protestant , Mormon , Seventh Day Adventist , and Jewish . Some Oriental and African religions , especially polytheistic ones , do not ; meals are consumed by members of the sexes separately and small children eat with the women . A common Christian view with a scriptural basis ( St. John 6:63 ) is : It is the spirit that quickeneth ; the flesh profiteth nothing ... This is true in all domains . Thus , the spirit with which food is consumed is the critical variable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domain , the Christian view builds on the scriptural precedents of Judaism . ( Prov. 15:17 ) : Better is a dinner of herbs where love is , than a stalled ox and hatred therewith . ( KJV ) When people get along in harmony , food and people interactions are friendly , hearty , and pleasant . In this case , the meal is satisfying even if the actual food is limited to vegetables , i.e. , the food of the poor . When people do not get along because of mutual envy and strife , malice causes hating and being hated . In this case , a prime cut from the best feedlot steer ( the " stalled ox " ) can not normalize the food and people interactions , so the meal is not satisfying . Hence , of the two alternatives , less desirable food is preferable to undesirable food and people interactions . Another associated scriptural point ( Eccl. 2:24 ) is : There is nothing better for man , than that he should eat and drink and that he should make his soul enjoy good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was from the hand of God . ( KJV ) One of the meanings of enjoy is " to have for one 's use or benefit . " Thus , in this context , it means that wages from labor should be used to provide food and drink for the body and the spirit . It is easily seen that this basic provision is from the hand of God . Rest from work and cares on the Sabbath was enjoined on the Jews by Mosaic Law . This is a traditional convention observed to a variable degree by some Christian sects . The exception is the Mormons , on whom it was enjoined by prophetic revelation . Thus , Orthodox Jews do no food preparation on the Sabbath . One-dish meals requiring long , slow cooking overnight have been devised for Sabbath meals and are customarv , as  | are cold food items . Similarly , since the Lord 's Day is observed as a day of rest by the Mormons , basic preparation is completed the preceding clay ; this minimizes exertion . Finish food preparation designed to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerfulness is allowed by Mormon doctrine ( D &C; 59:13 ) . ' In Judaism , the definition of what is food is delimited as a means to self-mastery . Hence , the stated position : " The dietary laws train us in t he mastery over our principles , not to consider the pleasure of eating and drinking as the end of man 's existence . " ( Maimonides ) The definition of what is food is also delimited by concepts of sanctity of life . Reverence for life is shown by different means in Eastern and Western religions . Vegetarianism , a feature of several Oriental religions ( Buddhism , Hinduism ) , is the overt manifestation of a reverence for life . In some casedmeat is proscribed because of an associated belief that the souls of those who did not do well during their human existence devolve to lower forms in the subsequent incarnation , so reside in animals . To consume the flesh of animals so regarded would be tantamount to cannibalism . In Western religions , proscription of blood as food is the overt manifestation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Noah ( Gen. 9:4 ) and then was detailed in the Mosaic Law ( Lev . 17:10 ? 14 ) : And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel , or of the strangers that sojourn among you , that eateth any manner of blood ; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood , and will cut him off from among his people . For the life of the flesh is in the blood ... Therefore , I said unto- the children of Israel , No soul of you shall eat blood , Neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood . And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel , or of the strangers that sojourn among you , which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten ; he shall even pour out the blood thereof , and cover it with dust . For it is the life of all flesh ; the blood of it is for life thereof ; therefore I said unto the children of Israel , Ye shall eat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all flesh is the blood thereof : whosoever eateth it shall be cut off . ( KJV ) These scriptures are the basis for the koshering process ( see discussion of Jewish foodways ) . In New Testament times , the apostles and elders decreed that Christians should abstain from blood ( Acts 15:20 , 29 ; 21:25 ) . Hence , consumption of blood puddings and blood sausages , etc. , is forbidden . In some of the other religions , the sanctity of life is expressed via strictures regarding the foods to eat for " health " and proscriptions to be observed to prevent bodily harm . Three major religions assert the im- portance of consuming a well balanced diet in order to nourish the body as the temple in which the soul resides . These are Seventh Day Adventists , Mormons , and Muslims . For Seventh Day Adventists , the scriptural basis for their health emphasis is 1 Cor. 3:16 ? 17 : Know ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth within you ? If any man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for the temple of God is holy , which temple ye are . ( KJV ) Ellen White ( nee Harmon ) , inspired by divine visions , called members ' attention to their duty to maintain health by temperance in eating , drinking , and drugging . A corollary belief is that the body will function best on a diet of simple foods , i.e. , grains , fruits , vegetables , and nuts . However , most members are lacto-ovo vegetarians . The rejection of flesh foods has three bases : ( a ) avoidance of scripturally unclean foods such as pork , ( b ) the suggestion that meat consumption causes diseases , and ( c ) the suggestion that meat consumption makes people more animalistic and less humanly sympathetic . Stimulants such as coffee , tea , alcohol , and tobacco are proscribed and use of strong spices and condiments that might harm the digestive tract is discouraged . Between-meal eating also is discouraged in order to rest the digestive organs . For Mormons , the scriptural basis for their health emphasis has several scriptural bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above ) and D &C; 89:18 , 20 : And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings , walking in obedience to the commandments , shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones ; ... And shall run and not be weary , and shall walk and not faint . Prophetic revelation incapsulated as what is called the Word of Wisdom provides details in keeping the scripture of 1 Cor. 3:16-17 . The basic point is stated as follows ( D &C; 89:10 ? 12 ) : And again , verily I say unto you , all wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the constitution , nature , and use of man Every herb in the season thereof , and every fruit in the season thereof ; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving . Yea , flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air , I the Lord , have ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving , nevertheless they are to be used sparingly ; Other strictures recommend abstinence from alcohol ( D &C; 89:7 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as coffee and tea ( D &C; 89:9 ) .  | Subsequent interpretation has extended the meaning of the latter to include cola drinks and other caffeine-containing foods . These doctrinal strictures were revealed in modern times . Hence , they supersede the scriptural injunctions . Furthermore , Mormons are expected to get enough physical exercise to maintain a healthy physique ; obesity is not condoned . And , individual intolerances to particular foods are acknowledged and respected . Other Christian sects , including Jehovah 's Witnesses , take the position that individual Christians are personally responsible for ascertaining unhealthy sensitivities related to consumption of particular foods , i.e. , alcoholic beverages , caffeine-containing beverages , sugar and/or honey , and salt . Individual sensitivities are regarded as dictating individual abstinence . These sects affirm the position that scripture does not categorically condemn consumption per se , but rather unwise selection or quantity . Additional scriptural wisdom ( Prov. 25:16 , 27 ) is also cited : Hast thou found honey ? eat so much as is sufficient for thee , lest thou be filled therewith , and vomit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so for men to search their own glory is not glory . ( KJV ) For Muslims , prophetic revelation documented in the Koran forbids consumption of the flesh of animals that die of disease or strangulation , blood , pork , or wine or other alcoholic beverages . Muslims are exhorted to eat foods necessary for development of strong bodies . To this end , a number of foods are stipulated : honey , milk , dates , meat , seafood , sweets , and vegetable oil . Fasting is used as a periodic means of restricting food intake for reasons of health . The basic scriptural definition of food that is accepted by Jews and Christians alike is Gen. 1:29 : ... I have given you every herb bearing seed , which is upon the face of all the earth , and every tree , in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed ; to you it shall be for meat . ( KJV ) Thus , until the Flood , man was vegetarian . The distinction between clean and unclean animals apparently referred only to fitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructed ( Gen. 9:3 , 4 ) : Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you ; even as the green herb have I given you all things . But the flesh with the life thereof , which is the blood thereof , shall ye not eat . ( KJV ) Although God had decreed that man could eat all flesh , Mosaic law as  | suming pork , shellfish , etc. ( see discussion of Jewish foodways ) . In contrast , Christians were specifically warned by the Holy Spirit against such prohibitions as doctrines of the devil ( 1 Tim . 4:1 , 3 ) : ... and commanding to abstain from meats , which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth . ( KJV ) Thus , for many Christians , a religious regulation prohibiting consumption of meat is viewed as evidence that a religion is degenerate and has accepted doctrines of the devil . Jehovah 's Witnesses and Mormons are warned against this problem . Continuing , scripture indicates that any food can be eaten ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature of God is good , and nothing to be refused , if it be received with thanksgiving ; For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer . ( KJV ) Jews , Christians , and Muslims have long been informed of the proper way of dealing with drunkards and gluttons . Scriptural counsel is as follows ( Deut. 21:20 ? 21 ) : And they shall say unto the elders of his city , This our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard . And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones , that he die : so shalt thou put away evil from among you ; and all Israel shall hear , and fear . ( KJV ) Warnings with respect to the consequences of intemperate eating and drinking have scriptural bases in many religions ; in others , alcohol is proscribed , as noted . Scripture accepted by Jews , Muslims , and Christians ( Prov. 20:1 ) says : Wine is a mocker , strong drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise . ( KJV ) Old Testament scripture provides further guidance for Jews , most Christians , including Pentecostal , and Muslims ( Prov. 23:20 , 21 ) : Be not among winebibbers ; among riotous eaters of flesh . For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty : and drowsiness shall clothe a man in rags . ( KJV ) This rather graphically depicts the effects . Excesses of wine and meat lead to drowsiness . As a result , men are stupified so that they can not pay  | attention to their business by which they provide for themselves and their families . Then , their excesses become costly and they are impoverished . Clearly , this is a food and people interaction in which " the food and drink get even with the person . " Thus , believers are warned against greediness leading to intemperance . Use of alcohol in moderation is not forbidden . In fact , scripture acknowledges that wine is associated with joy and pleasure ( Eccl. 9:7 ; John 2:2 ? 10 ) and can be used to calm people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong drink unto him that is ready to perish , and wine unto these that be of heavy hearts . Let him drink , and forget his poverty , and remember his misery no more . ( KJV ) Eating/not eating proscribed foods as a matter of conscience is another function circumscribed by religious strictures . For each dispensation ( period in time involving a system of revealed commands and promises regulating human affairs ) , there has been a somewhat different set of particulars , apparently according to the needs of time and place . Thus , even for the sake of courtesy , practicing Jews , Hindus , Muslims , and members of some Christian sects do not consume proscribed foods . Following New Testament scriptures , Catholic and most Protestant sects do not make an issue of eating/not eating particular foods ( Col. 2:16 , 17 ; 1 Cor. 10:25-27 , 31-32 ) : Let no man therefore judge you in meat , or in drink ... which are a shadow of things to come ... ( KJV ) You may eat anything sold in the meat-market without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord 's and everything in it . If ' an unbeliever invited you to a meal and you care to go , eat whatever is put before you , without raising questions of conscience . Well , whether you eat or drink , or whatever you are doing , do all for the honour of God ; give no offence to Jews , or Greeks , or to the church of God . For my part I always try to meet everybody half-way , regarding not my own good but the good of the many ... ( NE ) ' The point that Christians should not offend by eating/not eating particular foods is outlined in detail ( Rom. 14 : 1-23 ) and is reiterated ( 1 Cor. 3:1-13 ) . This is coupled with the concept that one should not superimpose his food beliefs/practices on others . The reasons given are that ( a ) eating/not eating food X does not make or break a Christian , so it is not important enough to justify grieving others or becoming a model to lead another away from his/her beliefs ( no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b ) out of respect for others one must not despise those with a more restricted definition of what is food , and in turn , the latter must not judge the former to be loose , ( c ) when in doubt about whether a food should be eaten /not eaten , then one should abstain , unless to do so would create a problem for others . Some Protestant sects emphasize one aspect of the rules ( Rom. 14:21 ) : It is a fine thing to abstain from eating meat or drinking wine , or doing anything which causes your brother 's downfall ( NE ) Thus , some groups , e.g. , Southern Baptists , proscribe alcohol under any circumstances but otherwise consume whatever is offered , so as not to offend . Mormonism is an exception among Christian sects in that proscriptions are observed as a matter of conscience . The underlying belief is that in these trying latter days , additional prophetic revelation known as the Word of Wisdom was given as a guide . Expedience and the possibility of giving offense to a fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fasting Fasting is another common practice . Although exotic Oriental philosophical/religious styles of fasting recently have been applied in bizarre ways by Western atheists and agnostics , our Judeo-Christian heritage is not without precedents for fasting . Jews have fasted since early times . The New Testament refers to Jewish observance of public fasts but nowhere does it contain a command enjoining Christian fasts . But , there is scriptural precedent for Christian fasting ( Acts 13:2-3 , 14-23 ) . Catholics , some Protestant sects , and Mormons have long practiced fasting . In general , Christians are enjoined to give no outward sign of fasting ; there is no merit , if one is praised for it ( Matt. 6:17-18 ) . The World Food Problem developed in 1974 . The World Council of Churches responded by recommending that one day per month be set apart as a fast day to save food for those in need . The various sects have used the released funds for various charitable purposes , including support of foreign disaster feeding programs . Muslims observe three kinds of fasts ( see discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were observed by all of the people and their animals . Rabbinical exemptions for children under the age of 12 , the ill , pregnant and lactating women , the very elderly , and animals  | have been granted since . On ordinary fast days , no food or drink is consumed during daylight hours . On special fast days , the fast is for the full 24 hours and extends to abstinence from other stipulated sources of sensual gratification . Fasts are one , three , or seven days in length ; they usually do not include the Sabbath or festival periods . Public fast days are Mondays and Thursdays . Partial fasts limited to abstension from meat , wine , and pleasure also are observed , sometimes only for a few hours . In common with other Near Eastern religions , fasting is viewed by Jews as the means of getting requests filled by God . God is expected to note that the pious afflict themselves as a symbol of humility and , therefore , compassion is called for . Exigencies for which fasting has a scriptural precedent are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1 Sam . 7:60 , Joel 2:12-15 , Jonah 3:5 ) ( b ) In the face of great danger to avert or terminate a great calamity ( 11 Chron. 20:3 , Esther 4:3 ) ( c ) When in great need of divine guidance , especially when going on a journey ( Ezra 8:21 ) ( d ) When enduring tests and meeting temptations ( Joel 2:12-15 ) ( e ) When studying , meditating , or concentrating on understanding God 's purposes In modern times , only 2 fasts are widely observed : Yom Kippur ( Day of Atonement ) , a complete 24-hour fast ( Lev . 16:29-31 , 23:27-32 ) and the Ninth of Av . Jewish fasts are classified into 3 groups : ( a ) Fasts decreed by God or referred to in scripture : Day of Atonement , Ninth of Av , 17th of Tammuz , 3rd of Tishri , and Fast of Esther ( b ) Fasts decreed by the rabbis ( selected ) : Ten Days of Penitence ( between Rosh Hashanah and the Day of Atonement ) , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in winter , the Three Weeks of Mourning between the 17th of Tammuz and the Ninth of Av , Seventh of Adar , Eve of Passover ( firstborn males ) ( c ) Private fasts : anniversaries of parents ' deaths or that of an esteemed teacher , the wedding day until the ceremony , as appropriate to avert the evil effects of nightmares . Catholic Fasting. ? Jesus affirmed the principle of fasting but left no rules . As a result , beliefs and practices have evolved over time ; these differ among the various branches of the Catholic Church : ( a ) Roman Catholic . Abstinence and fast have different meanings . Abstinence means that no meat is consumed , but the quantity of other foods is not restricted . Fast means that the total quantity of food is limited . Fast days are not observed by the ill . Current fasts include : - 40 days of Lent ; each individual ( children only ? ) gives up one favorite item which may he a food  | - Ember Days ? instituted in the 11th Century and discontinued as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old stations ( weekly fast days ) , observed on Wednesdays , Fridays , and Saturdays in winter ( the week after the third Sunday in Advent ) , in spring ( the week after the first Sunday in Lent ) , in summer ( the eight-day period beginning with Pentecost ) , and in autumn ( the week after September 14 , the Feast of Holy Cross ) . - Rogation Days ( gang days ) ? the three days before Holy Thursday . April 25 is the date of a pagan ceremony called the Robigalia , which was celebrated to protect sprouting crops from blight by rust or robigo by offering the entrails of a dog and a sheep to the god Robigus . Rogation Days supplant this ceremony and utilize processions or gangs . - All Fridays , except Christmas Day if it falls on Friday - Vigils before certain festivals ( b ) Eastern Orthodox . Fast means abstinence from meat and other animal products including milk , cheese , eggs , and butter ; fish ( except clams , shrimp , and oysters ) ; and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not observed by the ill . Current fasts include : - 40 days of Lent ( obligatory ) ? pre-Lenten preparation involves Meat Fare Sunday two weeks before Lent on which all remaining meat or fish is consumed . Cheese , eggs , milk , and butter are permitted during the ensuing week through Cheese Fare Sunday on which all remaining is consumed . Thereafter , that is , during Lent , none of these items are consumed except fish , which is consumed on Palm Sunday and on the Annunciation Day of the Virgin Mary . - Fast of the Apostles for the octave of Pentecost to June 29th , St. Peter and St. Paul 's Day - Fast of the Mother of God ? August 1 through 14 - Fast of the Nativity of Our Lord ( Advent ) ? the 40 days between November 15 and December 25 - Decollation of John Baptist ? August 29 - Holy Cross Day ? September 14 - Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year ( obligatory ) , except on the day before Ascension Day ( 40 days after Easter ) on which oil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is Biblical precedent for fasting , many Protestant churches do not encourage fasting . Those that do , including Pentecostal , regard fasting as a personal spontaneous act . Modes of fasting vary ; fasts may be partial or complete , from brief periods of one meal to extended periods of several days . Mormon Fasting. ? Fasts are to be observed only by saints ( members ) in sound physical and mental health , so that there will be no adverse  | effects . Prophetic revelation of the Lord 's command to continue in fasting and prayer ( D &C; 88:76 ) is partially implemented by organized fasting one day per month ( instituted in 1855 as the first Thursday ; changed in 1896 to the first Sunday ( Rich 1972 ) ) . This is a 24-hour fast , from Saturday evening to Sunday evening , and includes abstinence from food , drink , and other forms of bodily gratification and indulgence . One of the chief purposes of fasting is the contribution of the food saved , or its equivalent in money , for the welfare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be observed in the right spirit ; true and hypocritical observances are contrasted ( Isa. 58:3 ? 8 ) and provide scriptural guidance . Additional discretionary fast days are observed as spiritual preparation for a variety of church rituals and purposes by participating individuals . Buddhist Fasting. ? Buddha was opposed to asceticism because in his view it was excessive , and anything excessive was anathema . Fasting was discredited in the Dhammapada . Several passages state that fasting is not useful to a person who has failed to overcome desire ; fasts can not purify the passions . Nonetheless , fasting was enjoined by monastic regulations ; all males are expected to serve as monks for some period of time in their lives . The different monastic orders developed distinctive fasting regulations . In general , fasting is to be done for the sake of joy , frugality , purity , and contentedness . Hence , fasts are to be restrained rather than complete and prolonged . Fasting is practiced by monks and the laity as meritorious discipline . Ordinarily , they eat only at noon , only what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no food is consumed between meals . Water is permitted ad libitum . Complete fasts are observed four times per month , including the days of the new and full moon . Muslim Fasting. ? Mohammed , the prophet of Islam , was opposed to asceticism and did not advocate fasting . Nonetheless , prestigious followers instituted the practice of fasting as a time of reaffirmation of faith and for the remission of sins . Fasting is from sunrise to sunset ; no food or drink is taken ( requiring much discipline in lands where daytime temperatures may reach 140 ? F ) . Young children , the aged , the ill , travelers , and pregnant or lactating mothers are exempt from fasting . However , days missed for reasons of travel , pregnancy or lactation must be made up . ( See discussion of Muslim foodways for particulars . ) Feasting associated with religious holidays is a common feature of many religions . Observance varies from vestiges of traditional rituals to a vital component of contemporary celebration . Feasting is a prominent feature of the Oriental religions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not observed by some sects . Thus , important holy days are celebrated by Buddhists , Hindus , Jews , and Muslims with a feast . Holy days are joyous occasions to be celebrated with good food ;  | special foods are prepared and served on each . Involved ritual preparation is customary . For the Christian , plenty of somewhat dressed-up foods and a few traditional items are more typical . However , Pentecostals do not observe special feast days . In contrast , Lutherans feast by having pot-luck dinners to welcome new members , as socials , when the congregation gathers to vote and on secular and religious holidays as well . Even Sunday service is an occasion for coffee and sweets in most congregations . Clearly the foodways and food and people interactions are greatly affected by religion , though each group has its own variation . To relate to peoples with differing beliefs one must expand one 's consciousness and then proceed with sensitivity . FOODS AND NUTRITION : " DOING YOUR OWN THING " One of the answers to the question " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attitude that values ( or does not value ) the use of foods and nutrition as a medium for self-actualization . Self-actualization or the power to express oneself is the lowest level of basic need . It is emphasized when higher level needs have been satisfied to some degree . The food and people interaction provides many opportunities for selfexpression that can be rewarding . The traditional role of a woman included home food production and service . But , over time the necessity for the woman to perform these functions diminished . So , now any family member can use this domain for self-expression . Increasingly , men have become weekend chefs , teenagers have made divinity or brownies , and even pre-school children have learned to prepare simple foods . The problem in using food and people interactions for self-expression reduces to one of selecting which food(s) and which social food-serving situation(s) can be developed as a personal trademark for purposes of identity . The item(s) so selected then becomes a part of the array of foods consumed . The explanation for inclusion in the diet is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Self-actualization can mean a number of things , for example : preparing tasty nutritious meals ; developing skill in home gardening , home canning or home freezing , or home baking of breads , cakes , pies , or cookies ; preparing ethnic meals ; or preparing buffet and bridge luncheons that are perfect . On the other hand , it may mean development of a limited skill such as the ability to char-broil steaks , to make fudge or divinity , or to bake brownies . The range of possibilities is almost endless . In recent years , the domestic arts associated with food and people interactions have been revived for the specific purpose of self-expression .  | The American culture traditionally has valued skill in the domestic ; arts . In part this stems from the early need to help family members deal with a hard existence in a hostile untamed land . The kitchen was the center of the home . And , a woman was valued if she could provide tasty meals and serve them in such a way as to affirm the strength and serenity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attitudes change . By 1938 , the role of the food and people interaction in family support had diminished and had been devalued . The standard food and nutrition text of the day , Feeding the ! Family by Mary Swartz Rose , made the following point : " I should n't mind housekeeping if it were not for planning meals " ? how often have we heard this ? There is a sort of inevitableness about meals which makes then seem truly awful at times . A hungry family and nothing on the table is terrible to contemplate . But routine ( drudgery if you will ) loses much of its depressing power when work gains significance . To see the children rosy , the family accounts free from doctor 's bills , and an atmosphere of serenity in the home are surely compensations for the time and thought given to family meals ' The tradition-directed person can relate to this quotation . A person of this nature will begin to value the development of necessary skills and will find many opportunities for self-expression through food . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual first has to value consumption of a nutritionally adequate diet . A person growing up in a home where tasty nutritious meals are valued may take them for granted . This depends on the amount and kind of dialogue in the home . Some homemakers are good providers out of duty . Others do it for the love and joy of it . Duty tends to generate neutral to negative feelings resulting in taking it for granted . Whereas , love and joy communicate a positive value . In the 1970s Americans rejected the value of providing good meals . In part , this probably was because so few women had or would take the necessary time . Also , reasonably high quality convenience foods of many types became available . And , another set of factors may have been operative . Compared with previous times , children were healthy , people were relatively affluent and did not bother to calculate small differences in costs , and home serenity became only a dream , given the number of factors beyond immediate control . So , for many the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these points were less important so devaluation did not occur . Because many devalued the traditional role of a woman in providing  | tasty nutritious meals , the inner-directed person may have opted to use some aspect of the food and people interaction for self-actualization . Mastery , or " I can do X , " is a power-giving self-concept . IF home-grown , home canned , home frozen , or home baked goods are valued , THEN a person is usually motivated to develop skills for producing them . Today , when skills of these types are unnecessary , pride in mastery becomes a value . So , new methods and new recipes have been introduced . These frequently use spices , seeds , honey , and other uncommon ingredients for reasons of distinctiveness . In this way , because these specialty items are produced they are consumed . The other-directed person will utilize the food and people interaction or some aspect of it , for self-actualization if it is the current fad . Thus , in recent years , because there has been a wave of interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have reaped the rewards and have acquired status . Food quality and other aspects of usual food and people interactions are symbols of high quality of life . Sharply rising food prices have threatened , if not reduced , customary levels of consumption . This is viewed as undermining and inconsistent with concepts of appropriate quality of life . Hence , resentment , resistance , and hostility have become manifest . Some skills in food purchasing , money management , and the like have been revalued upward to meet the crisis . To maintain a normal facade and avoid embarrassment with respect to the question " Why do you eat or not eat X ? , " many have begun to employ these skills quietly and privately . To maintain quality of life in the face of rising food costs is not easy . According to Rose ( 1938 ) , " ... the satisfaction of ceasing to grope blindly ( which is drudgery ) and acquiring a conscious power over one 's environment ... makes even the difficult task interesting and joyous . " ' Thus , one way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with the will to work in maintaining life-style . The food and people interactions provide many opportunities to do this .  | What Is Food ? What Is Poison ? In man 's near environment , there always have been many items that man perceived might be used for food . At the same time , some peoples have avoided eating available plant or animal tissues ( specific items or classes of items ) that could be used for food , as demonstrated by the fact that other peoples used them for food . That is , by convention , particular peoples had decreed that selected food items are inedible or poisons , i.e. , something that would cause illness or death . Early on , man also learned that what appeared to be food might turn out to be poison and that some means to distinguish between the two classes of items was necessary in order to prevent illness and/or death . As man learned to sort items into " food " and " poison , " some definitions and generalizations regarding the basis for sorting emerged . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of perspectives that account for the decision to eat/not eat an item . Topics include : ( a ) Food rejection : food avoidances and food proscriptions ( b ) Physiological definitions of food and poison ( c ) Emotional /psychological definitions of food and poison ( d ) Socio-cultural definitions of food and poison ( e ) Health-related definitions of food and poison ( f ) Economic definitions of food and poison ( g ) Aesthetic definitions of food and poison ( h ) Subgroup definitions of food and poison An understanding of the various definitions of food and poison is a necessary prerequisite for the professional who is involved in assessment of an individual 's relation to his/her food environment . Food avoidances restrict the array of foods consumed . The probability of an adequate nutrient intake is reduced and may vanish . Since for a particular individual or group any food may be regarded as either food or poison , one must ascertain how it is classified . Using a  | standardized list of items with provision for write-ins , one may observe and/or question individuals or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods are consumed by choice and will continue to be classified as food except under unusual circumstances . Items that are proscribed will be classed as poisons as long as the supporting beliefs continue . IF one pursues the matter beyond the first response , THEN one usually finds that some items may be classified as either food or poison , depending on the circumstances . Items that are barely accepted evoke a passive response . They are consumed for lack of an alternative . Given an alternative , acceptance turns to rejection . Under special circumstances , some items that normally are avoided might be consumed . Without an understanding of the reasons for the distinction , one can not predict the classification of these items . FOOD REJECTION : FOOD AVOIDANCES AND PROSCRIPTIONS Rejection of any food item or class of items is an overt individual action that may result from beliefs , attitudes , and/or intentions . Reasons for the action generally may be classed as personal avoidances or collective conventions and proscriptions . However , collective reasons must be internalized to be implemented . So , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . Personal Avoidances The degree of preference for or avoidance of an item is determined partly by exposure to and experience with it . For example , if a preferred food is served with a high frequency , one may become tired of it . Then one may rebel and avoid it , perhaps permanently . Or , a food that is usually enjoyed may have no appeal and may be avoided during illness . Or , a food that is preferred may not look quite right and may be temporarily avoided . This is especially likely to occur if previous experience with variable quality resulted in a negative association between appearance and presence of a defect that was unpleasant or harmful . The array of reasons based on beliefs and attitudes is extensive . Many intentions are logical outgrowths . These include , but are not limited to , the following types : ( a ) health-related ? " I ate X and got a stomachache ; I will never eat X again . ( b ) association ? " I had a pet duck ( rabbit , goat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or whatever ) . "  | ( c ) surfeit ? " I once had to eat turkey ( or whatever ) every day for period X ; I can not tolerate the smell of it cooking much less eating it . " ( d ) snobbery ? " Lesser beings of type X eat X ; how could you suggest that a person of my class eat X ! " ( e ) preference ? " I dislike X ( no particular reason that I can ( or will ) state ) ; I will never eat X. " ( f ) indifference ? " I do n't care that much about X ; I just do n't think of it . " Some people have an attitude that they have been eating food X all of their lives , so they will not stop for any reason . Others have the attitude that they have never eaten item X and will not start . In these cases , preferences or avoidances are based on permanent intentions . Collective Conventions Items that are defined as " food " may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be inappropriate under the circumstances . These are collective conventions ; several examples follow : ( a ) instant orange juice ? It would be selected by those who prefer it , usually at breakfast or between meals . It would be avoided at lunch and dinner as unsuitable . ( b ) butterscotch sauce ? This item usually is served in conjunction with a dessert , which is served at lunch , dinner or p.m. snack . It would be avoided as inappropriate at breakfast as it would not complement the items served . ( c ) mixed sweet pickles ? This item usually is served with a sandwich . It is not appropriate at breakfast . Formerly , they were a daily accompaniment at both lunch and dinner meals . They were homemade and available . But , for whatever reasons , at the present time they are not valued enough to warrant purchase in a quantity sufficient for daily service . The result is that now it is considered inappropriate to serve them routinely at both lunch and dinner . This type of avoidance is passive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast to other types of avoidance which are more active in that an emotional/psychological response is added to the avoidance behavior . Because what we eat is limited largely to what items are commercially available , most people are only vaguely aware that they would avoid certain other foods . IF a person were to inquire whether an individual would eat dog or snake , THEN the individual would say no . But , IF the individual were asked to list items not eaten , THEN such items probably would not be recalled . They just are not considered as a possible source of food . For this reason , this emotional/psychological response is probably  | less than in an individual who has been trained to avoid such items . So , they are not recalled because by convention they are ignored . Collective Proscriptions Since the Year One , in almost every society , collective proscriptions have been used as a powerful means for social control . Society has used a number of measures to ensure that members were conscious of tabooed foods and would overreact if they ate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , a response of fear and horror of the magnitude elicited by a callous murder was carefully cultivated . Before proceeding with discussion , a number of terms need to be defined . Some of these are used with a meaning that differs from the popular one . Terms called to reader attention are : ( a ) food ? A solid or liquid that is consumed by members of a group . Context must be specified , because the definition applies only given a definition of the group 's culture at a stated place and time . ( b ) food aversion ? An intense or definite dislike accompanied by feelings of repugnance , loathing , and/or revulsion . It is an avoidance based on an ingrained feeling against an item that is perceived to be disagreeable and offensive . - repugnance ? An emotional opposition to items incompatible with one 's ideas and tastes ; e.g. , snake or lizard meat would evoke this response . - loathing ? An expression of extreme disgust . - revulsion ? A drawing away from the item in horror , e.g. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating pet dog . ( f ) proscribe ? To condemn or forbid as harmful ; prohibit . Proscriptions are disseminated by formal decree . ( g ) proscription ? This is an imposed restraint or restriction . ( h ) defiled ? A person , place , or thing that is inherently or ( corrupted so as to become ) dirty or unclean , hence unfit . - unclean ? It is prohibited for use or contact ( by ritual law ) . The implication is that the item is infected with harmful supernatural contagion . - unfit ? Not suitable . - ceremonially defiled ? Contact with X makes one unclean , according to church rules . ( f ) religious observance ? A customary practice or ceremony or an instance of following a religious custom , rule , or law . The theoretical explanation for and mode of enforcement of collective food avoidances and aversions now must be considered . The leaders of a social group/religious group define what is food , i.e. , which plant and/or  | animal items are OK/NOT OK for its members to eat . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary motivation behind the need to define what is food is group survival . Food is important to people , so it can be used as a lever in social pressure . Food is power . Food can be used as a factor in group cohesion and identification . People who have something in common tend to unite , then the common factor serves as a basis for identification . For example , people who do not eat X acquire a label and everybody knows that they do not eat X. Once branded with the label , people fight for survival of their group . It is worse to be beyond the pale . On the other hand , leaders of an established group may wish to accentuate differences from other groups in their territory . To this end they study what nearby groups eat/do not eat and select some item(s) to create a difference . Then they set up rules to guide social pressure , in order to ensure group cohesion . In essence , group members must develop the designated kind of food discipline in order to demonstrate group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily distinguish between members of the " in " group , i.e. , those who have the food avoidance or aversion , and outsiders who do not . It also turns out that over time the foods accepted by members of the " in " group increase in familiarity and the foods avoided become strange . Astute leaders magnify these differences with supportive myths to create fear and anxiety as a consequence of consumption of strange items . This sets up a conditioned response of tension and fear of the unknown . The result is that people become reluctant to try strange foods . So , these strange items become " not food , " and not tried is equivalent to dislike . Thus , the array of potential foods is restricted by food avoidances . From the above , one might conclude that the array of foods is continually shrinking . Fortunately , there is a counter-balancing process that occurs simultaneously . There is a . If the item(s) is/are accepted , this is perceived as a vote of confidence for the would-be leader and the definition of what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptance by some , the food array is constantly changing . In contemporary society , the subgroup where this pattern is most evident is that of Orthodox Jews . Originally , Jews and Moslems lived in the same territory and food taboos were one means of identification . Since the diaspora , Jewish leaders have found it necessary to inflate and strengthen differences from others in order to prevent integration and assimilation ( which are equivalent to group dispersion , the opposite of what is wanted by group leaders since dispersion extinguishes power ) . So , in this group , food is power , and it must be controlled .  | In contemporary society , collective food behavior has become very important to Black leaders ? hence , Soul Food . Until the 1960s , Blacks were becoming integrated into the Caucasian society , so the Black leaders created an identity crisis as a means of reasserting their position . The outcome was the " Black is Beautiful " strategy , one outgrowth of which was Black studies . Since food is power , Soul Food surfaced and Blacks learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was successful for the Blacks , leaders of other ethnic groups tried it . They " discovered " that members of their groups had become assimilated and that they were losing/had lost power . So , they " discovered " the power of the food and people interaction . And , American society has witnessed a succession of ethnic food fads . In the long run , it is apparent that the use of the food and people interaction in social power games cycles back and forth according to temporal importance of need for power . Success depends on timing . And , this depends on the aggregate need of individuals to belong to American or ethnic subgroups for reasons of identity . In any case , in contemporary American society , the overwhelming response to breaking a food taboo has been attenuated . Collective food proscriptions are not that powerful because of the diversity of backgrounds , mobility , and anonymity . All individuals reject some foods . The professional who is trying to change food selections as part of a nutrition intervention program needs to distinguish between avoidances with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to deal with them successfully . For example , one may opt to ignore an avoidance based on a strong collective belief structure ; any other course would be likely to terminate the relationship . Moreover , the method of presenting the need to change a weak belief differs according to whether the individual is tradition- , inner- , or other-directed . For example , one might appeal to the inner-directed person with a logical argument and to the other-directed individual with the argument that " everybody is doing it . " When a food avoidance results from an individual intolerance , the appropriate response is to suggest a nutritional equivalent . When it is due to negative experiences , if important enough , one might attempt to overcome the aversion with a series of positive experiences . PHYSIOLOGICAL DEFINITIONS Some foods are forbidden and some foods are rejected , but what foods can man tolerate ? Consideration of the physiological definitions of food and poison answers this question . IF food is a liquid or solid substance t hat is consumed and nourishes the body and poison is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or absorbed , THEN can one  | predict whether a substance is a food or a poison ? Is quantity a factor in ability to tolerate ? The Case of Pure Foods Pure foods are popularly believed to be non-toxic . Otherwise people would be afraid to eat most things . Nonetheless , Boyd and Boyd ( 1973 ) reported their research which shows that while the lethal dose of some pure foods is so high as to be unlikely to be consumed by human beings ( 1/2 ton/day ) , consumption of a lethal dose of other foods is a possibility . Moreover , the researchers present evidence that animals who grow and appear normal on diets containing very large amounts of pure foods become susceptible to effects of other stresses . Thus , the importance of the question of quantity begins to emerge . These authors state : The basic concept . . . is that there is probably a toxic dose or amount of everything . This dose is an amount that overwhelms the body mechanisms for dealing with the substance in question . ' This quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operational definitions of food and poison are determined by careful research , using an index that defines relative toxicity as a criterion . LD50 is defined as a lethal dose for 50% of the sample . Subjects are given a series of graduated quantities and are observed . IF less than 50% die , THEN the quantity is manipulated until 50% die . This quantity is the dividing line between food and poison ; greater quantities are poisonous . In this way , the physiological definitions of food and poisons are obtained for various substances . The Nuremburg Code prevents giving lethal doses to man ; so animal studies are used and the quantities are extrapolated . It turns out , that for pure foods , animals die when given a lethal dose of food all at once because ( a ) the substance irritates and inflames the mucosal lining of the GI tract which causes pain and malabsorption and ( b ) the osmolar load is so high that it draws water into the intestines , causing diarrhea and at the same time dehydrating blood and tissues . The stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IF an animal survives the initial lethal dose , THEN it adapts . The effects disappear and the animal can continue to ingest the lethal doses with no observable effects . It also turns out , that IF the total lethal dose is divided into portions and given at intervals , THEN a much greater quantity is needed to have a lethal effect .  | While large quantities of a particular food can be ingested , tolerated , and adapted to , the effects are unpleasant and some risk is involved . The evidence is limited and a particular person 's LD is unknown . For this reason , some of the single-food fad diets are possibly hazardous . Physiological Demand for Nutrients All of the working cells of the body require variable quantities of a number of nutrients as raw materials used in cellular processes . Normally , the majority of nutrients are obtained by dietary intake . A few can be synthesized and some can be withdrawn from body stores , if available , to meet temporary needs . A nutrient supply/demand monitoring system is presented as a model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceptualization of the processes involved . Normally , when intracellular supply of a nutrient is low , it is replenished from the blood , whose main function is translocation of nutrients throughout the body . A normal circulating level of each nutrient is maintained continuously , to the extent possible , at a level that will supply all cells ' needs under normal circumstances . When the circulating level can not be maintained , life is threatened . Since the beginning , man 's intake of the various nutrients has been highly variable , often taking wide swings . So , to deal with this situation , the body has evolved some mechanisms that provide flexibility for dealing with a range of intakes : ( a ) flood extreme ? The body can eliminate some of most nutrients in t he urine , it can store some , or if levels are still too high nutrients can be detoxified. ( b ) famine extreme ? The body can draw some from reserve stores or it can recycle more effectively , or it can shift to low gear which reduces usage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit attached . Feedback mechanisms are auto-correcting at the local level under normal circumstances . On a continuous basis , the cells send what amounts to a " state of the cell " message . Since the supply/demand situation is critical to survival , these messages are sent out " Special Delivery " as a strong signal that will register . However , under some circumstances it may not register or the appropriate action may not be made because of the following : ( a ) busy signals ? Human beings have the capacity for mind over matt er . They can focus on something else and tune out the hunger/satiety signals . ( b ) noise as a distractor ? Worry , fear , etc. , keep the mind occupied so  | In response to various signals , various responses and messages are remitted . Some examples follow : ( a ) IF the signals result in reception of a pattern that is within normal range and not highly variable , THEN the " message received " signal is remitted . ( b ) IF the mean level registers high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signal to GI tissue is " not necessary " so that the response to food translates " that 's nice . " ( c ) IF the mean level registers low and this is a new message ( temporary ) , THEN the translation is " that 's OK " AND a message is sent that translates " draw from stores . " ( d ) IF the mean level registers low and the stores are low , THEN the message sent is " not OK , get food . " The result is that hunger pangs are generated and conservation mechanisms are implemented . At the same time , a portion of the alarm system registers and keeps checking to see if status is transient or if more and stronger measures must be taken to ensure survival . ( e ) IF the mean level registers low and stores are out AND no food intake continues , THEN the translator sends the message " NOT OK . Desperate , help , starving ! " Since the gut and general conservation measures have failed , a rationing system is implemented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kidneys function as best they can , as long as they can , and supply to other tissues an amount that is just sufficient to keep them marginally alive . After this point , the only remaining message is " Ca n't cope , sorry about that . " The situation described pertains to any nutrient , even those that are required only in trace quantities . By definition , IF a substance is a nutrient , THEN it is required in some quantity . One nutrient can not be substituted for another . In a few cases , one nutrient can perform some , but not all , of the functions of another . So , the requirement is absolute . Therefore , a diet that is inadequate in even one nutrient is not OK . Some effect can be expected . But , ability to observe effects is limited ; small differences can not be detected at the present time . In most cases only cumulative and aggregate effects resulting in major malfunctions , which are described as the classic deficiency diseases , are detected . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known . But , the effects of marginal intake are unknown ; these are under intensive investigation at the present time . Moreover , while the effects of absolute deficiency of one nutrient are known , with few exceptions the combined effects of multiple deficiencies are unknown . This is to be expected since ( a ) there are about 50 nutrients , ( b ) the number of combinations of multiple deficiencies is a very large number , and ( c ) the number of levels of deficiency is continuous  | from zero deficiency to total deficiency . Pre-selected combinations and levels of interest are under investigation . Because the task is infinite , ( he true definition of physiological demand for nutrients always will remain an unknown that challenges every generation . Man can have only the current approximation to truth ; some inkling of past approximations also may be known . Details of the monitoring system were described in Chapter 3 . The appostat or appetite mechanism converts signals of cellular need for nutrients to conscious awareness of hunger and , unless there is an interfering factor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of appetite is related to cellular demand for nutrients in the following way . For an individual , the aggregate demand of the active or processing cells is determined genetically by the basic architecture of the tissues and environmentally by physical exercise , which affects muscle development . Thus , a person with a large body developed for physical strength and endurance will have a different need for nutrients than one with a small and poorly developed body . The aggregate demand of adipose storage cells is determined by the number of storage cells required at three early periods in growth and development , i.e. , prenatal , infancy , and during the teenage growth spurt . IF the need to store excess fat exists during these three periods , THEN the number of adipose cells is increased and maintained at the new number . The cumulative effect is a greatly inflated number of cells . This is important to appetite control because a greater number of cells can take up a greater quantity of nutrients , causing the circulating levels to fall . IF there are many cells , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person is programmed to " feel " hungry . IF there are few cells , THEN the signal of need is smaller , THEREFORE a person is programmed to " feel " not hungry , which programs for thin to normal weight . Physiological Definition of Food Until recently , the available information led to the conclusion that only a " hungry/not hungry " signal could be sent . A corollary idea was that if the signal was to fill the stomach , a mixture probably would provide some of the nutrient needed ; if not , the signal could be continued . Newer evidence supports the position that the message may be somewhat more specific , at least for some nutrients like sodium . Suppose nutrient X is deficient and has caused the signal to be sent . It is reasonable to suppose that IF the circulating level is low , THEN receptors in the intestinal wall will be unsaturated . Therefore , uptake from ingested food is facilitated . Since the circulating level is low , nutrient X will move from the receptors into venous circulation . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately normal , at which equilibrium dynamics would slow uptake . Foods are digested and absorbed at variable rates depending on their liquid-to-solid ratio and proportions of fat , carbohydrate , and/or protein since these require different processing in digestion . IF a food is rapidly digested and absorbed AND IF it contains some of nutrient X , THEN the signal of need shuts off . IF a food that is slowly digested contains nutrient X , THEN the signal of need shuts off and stays off because absorption continues over a long period of time , i.e. , several hours . So unless a person eats by the clock or some other cue , no impulse to eat will occur . Thus , consumption of coffee , tea , and other clear liquids scarcely shuts off the signal since they are absorbed as is . In contrast , fat takes a long time to digest ; so the signal will be shut off and a person will not desire food . Thus , fat has great satiety value . Simple sugars , e.g. , sucrose , are easily degraded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starches require more extensive breakdown because of the long chain lengths ; they have moderate satiety value . Protein itself is slowly degraded and in food it is usually associated with fat ; therefore , it has almost as much satiety value . The satiety value of a meal containing a variety of foods is highly variable and depends on the proportions of fat , carbohydrate , and protein . Thus , it turns out that the physiological definition of food is determined by the nutrient needed and whether the substances ingested contain it in a quantity that shuts off the signal of need . EMOTIONAL/PSYCHOLOGICAL DEFINITIONS Contact with food or poison , or the thought of either , usually evokes an emotional/psychological response of some sort . The psychic and physical reaction to food and poison are experienced ( a ) subjectively as a strong feeling and ( b ) physiologically as a result of changes that prepare the body for immediate vigorous action , e.g. , release of adrenalin in the fright , fight , flight sequence . Both aspects are involved in man 's relation to his food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and partly physical responses characterized by pleasure , pain , attraction , and/or repulsion . The whole range of feelings can be evoked in response to the presence of or thought of food or poison . The feeling responses are variable in magnitude , intensity , and duration depending on the stimulus and experience with stimuli of the same kind . People are highly variable in the degree to which they are aware of their feelings in relation to food and poison stimuli . Awareness or consciousness denotes : ( a ) realizing that the psychophysical response has occurred ,   ( b ) perceiving or understanding what aspect of the stimulus or some association with it evoked the response , and ( c ) knowing or apprehending , i.e. , grasping , the meaning of the response for oneself and outside observers . In former times in America , people probably were more conscious of their feelings regarding food and poison . This is because of their religious mentality and the impression made by weekly sermons designed to raise their consciousness of ( a ) the temptations of pleasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , greedy etc. , ( c ) the virtue of disciplining oneself to endure monotony , and ( d ) the need to be thankful . Feelings were accepted as natural but to be controlled ; advice was given for dealing with them . Various sayings embodying the ideas , often as metaphors , were used to remind people of what they knew . In recent years the lack of meaning attributed to degenerating food and people interactions may reflect lack of understanding of emotional/psychological responses to food and poison and the definitions of food and poison that result . The array of feelings is universal . However , how a people " feels " about food varies among groups . The observable behaviors used to denote or express the various emotions also vary . Little is known about this aspect as it has not been studied to any extent . Prior to contact , one is indifferent ' to a food . Contact is a prerequisite to the development of feelings regarding food , the eating experience , and the eating territory . Contact can be physical causing a sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings , i.e. , they are responsive to or conscious of sense impressions ( Tables 16.1 and 16.2 ) , so the attributes of the food itself may attract or repel . Moreover , people are perceptive and can pick up both verbal and non-verbal cues to other people 's responses . From these experiences , people form beliefs and attitudes that reinforce the strength of emotions . After initial contact , other feelings can be generated ( Table 16.3 ) . A basic attraction can become a desire . The desire may take the form of a wish . Or , it may become a want that initiates food getting behavior . A food that is desirable and can be enjoyed , i.e. , it is available for one 's use and benefit and can give pleasure ( delight and joy ) , and satisfaction ( fulfillment of a need or want ) is considered delicious and delectable and may be consumed with gusto . The desire for a particular food may become stronger and compelling , so that the person responds when enticed , lured , tempted , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , desire may be coupled with envy and jealousy and result in covetousness . So , ultimately some foods become so desirable that they p 272 can not be served except to selected people because they have an individious effect . Thus , a few favored items become " super-foods " with high status  --  a special definition .  | Satisfaction of needs and desires can be achieved by everybody at a number of levels . One progresses from feeling full or satiated to gorged or replete . A glut or too much good food changes the food and people interaction from a positive experience to a negative one . Interest in the particular food or in any food palls and the person becomes indifferent ; food has no interest for the person . Surfeit becomes cloying and even the thought of food is wearisome . Monotony and boredom undermine tolerance for the food(s) until finally the food is rejected as poisonous . Each of these emotional states is ecologically different and the implications of the resultant food and people interactions for life expectancy also differ . Man has a tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desired food , then he/she would never want anything else . IF one has a mental set that predisposes one to gratitude , appreciation , and/or conWHAT //  | tentment , THEN this may be so . IF in pursuit of gustatory pleasure one acts to indulge , humor , or spoil , THEN one has become involved with a " more " spiral . All of these have negative connotations because they imply that one goes too far in satisfying desire . Temporarily , the definition of what is food is restricted to the few favored items . IF such a practice of restriction becomes customary , THEN an abnormal food and people interaction has been established ? it may threaten life expectancy . Hedonism is a life-style based on the doctrine that pleasure or happiness is the sole or chief good in life . IF enjoyment of food and drink becomes a predominant way for an individual to obtain pleasure , THEN the relationship may take on added emotional significance due to the concurrent satisfaction of status and self-actualization needs . Progressive levels of pleasure and satisfaction are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result . The definition of what is food is progressively restricted since the person becomes more discriminating ; at the same time the concept of poison expands . At one level , one is a gourmand ; at another , a gourmet ; at the ultimate level , one is an epicure . Normally , definition of what is food is not so narrow because people are generally less discriminating . However , within a group what food is good is defined . This enables people to evaluate food by comparison with a standard , which is often a mental construct . Given the standard , objectionable attributes are identified and serve as a basis for criticism or condemnation of the particular specimen(s) . These are labeled as poisonous or bad and disapproval results . Distaste or dislike for an item may degenerate to repugnance and avoidance . IF too many people find that samples of a food are unsatisfactory , THEN the item falls into disrepute and people are offended if the item is served to them . After this point , antipathy develops and the food is regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aversion increases , resulting in disgust . Then even the thought of the food is revolting . Finally , the food becomes abhorrent and detestable and loathsome ; it is invidious and odious . Thus , some foods that are usually acceptable are temporarily defined as poison and are rejected in the particular instance . Others lose favor and are permanently defined as poisonous and unfit for consumption . Such outcomes have an important effect on man 's relation to his food . The experience of physical pain as a result of consuming a food evokes a range of responses . A trivial amount of pain , by definition , stimulates or excites . Black pepper and mustard are added for their appetite stimulating effect that derives from their bite . At low levels the sensation is pleasant . At higher levels it is unpleasant because more irritates and may cause agitation .  | The shock of unexpected and sharp pain as a result of injury or allergic response causes a person to be apprehensive about consuming more of ' the same lot of food and/or trying a sample from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided as a result of fear . If the food was previously a favorite or it is forced on a person , considerable anguish may result . Thus , physical pain can result in restrictions on the definition of what is food . Like physical pain , mental pain also can evoke a range of responses that result in the redefinition of what is food . In this case , it is not usually an inherent quality of the food that evokes the response , but an association with a painful food and people interaction . Nonetheless , IF a special food was served on the painful occasion , THEN whenever the food is served , the painful situation may be recalled . IF so , THEN the food is regarded as poisonous and may be rejected . Agitation and/or hurt feelings lead to irritation . Then a person becomes offended and later disgusted . Repetition creates repugnance . What is distasteful and repellent becomes abhorrent and loathsome and finally invidious and odious . Thus , what is food is redefined and a carryover effect that influences similar food and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statusseeking . Thus , nourishing foods consumed by low status persons are redefined as poisonous , are held in disrepute , and are despised . Disgust , scorn , and disdain may be shown whenever such foods are mentioned or contempt may be shown for persons who serve them . Thus , for high status people , the definition of what is food is restricted to exclude these items . Uncertainty about food quality or the honesty/integrity of those who produce/process foods causes some people to redefine what is food so as to exclude items that they are unsure of . Wariness leads to dubiosity and doubt . These produce low level emotional/psychological responses and have only a minor effect on the definition of items to be included in the food array . Distrust and suspicion lead to mistrust and **33;945;TOOLONG involvement is greater and more items become questionable . Dubiety and agitation characterize final stages where many items are suspect and therefore avoided . Moreover , the person at this stage selects information that reinforces his/her doubt in order to maintain the integrity of his/her beliefs . Eating to excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repulsive to many . So , eating to excess has long been considered evil because obesity arises from the actual or imputed bad conduct of eating to excess on a continuing basis . Discipline is a means of perfecting moral character , in this case by imposing order on what is eaten and by training the person in selfcontrol . So , a person is trained to redefine what is food to a smaller  | number of less satisfying items . Diets fail because resentment results , obedience gives way , and one rebels . As a result of rebelling , the restricted definition of what is food is rejected and many desirable " poisons " are redefined as food . What is food is also determined in part by whether one eats alone or with companions . Emotional/psychological responses relating to social aspects of eating will be discussed in a later section . Development of Emotional/Psychological Definitions Each adult responds to items regarded as food in his/her culture according to the feeling evoked as a result of his/her original and/or continuous exposure to the item . The one exception is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The observable behavior may or may not reflect the real response . Some people are overt . Others are covert and control themselves to project whatever response they plan to . The definition of what is food in general is learned as is the unique overlay of personal restrictions . Little children will taste/eat anything within reach until they learn not to . Thus , they will " eat " cigarettes , dust balls , blocks , hair , a rattle , etc . Somebody says NO and projects an emotional/psychological vibration that gives the child the message . This child soon learns to label the item " not food . " This is the first level of learning . Children also learn what is " not food " from other experiences , for example : ( a ) imitation ? A father gives a non-verbal negative reaction such as a grimace when food X is served . Thereafter , the child defines the item " not food " and resists the mother 's efforts to coax the child into trying it . ( b ) sensitivity to pain ? Hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more sensitive than an adult due to a greater number of taste buds . After a painful experience , the child defines the item as " not food " and will not eat it . ( c ) muscular fatigue ? Children become tired of chewing . Tough meat or any meat may be defined as " not food " and rejected . ( d ) ridicule ? Little children lack refined muscular coordination so have difficulty handling slippery foods . If ridiculed or reprimanded for difficulties or an accident , they will define the item as " not food . " ( e ) television exposure ? What is food and what is good are learned from commercials , i.e. , sweet , chocolatey , crispy , crunchy are good and other flavors/textures are suspect so the items are rejected as " not food " when introduced . ( f ) tiresome ? Food jags are common . Children get turned on to an item and eat it to the exclusion of other foods , then suddenly they become tired of it and thereafter it is redefined as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time a person becomes an adult , his/her f s d experience has personalized the definition of what is food . In order that a child develop accepting attitudes toward food , experiences that evoke positive emotional/psychological responses are necessary . The number one objective in establishing the food and child relationship is to create a positive feeling , i.e. , a positive but undifferentiated background of awareness that is apart from any identifiable sensation , perception , or thought regarding food . Then , the objective shifts to providing eating experiences which evoke the range of feelings toward and away from foods , so that the child learns to distinguish and respond appropriately within the cultural context . These experiences form the basis for social competency in food and people interactions . Although a child 's initial response to a food may be negative , the response can be modified if the right strategy is employed . IF the food is available because it is served frequently AND others around the child consume it with enjoyment , THEN the child will be inclined to try it unless pressured to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given some of everything ( the child is given a " no thank you " portion ) AND everybody eats what is given , THEN the child may manage to eat the small amount and over time come to accept the food unless pressured to eat more , in which case a mild dislike may be increased by an element of defiance . Firmness but avoidance of force is the key . As teenagers or young adults , many people learn to use food to restore emotional/psychological balance after a crisis or on a chronic basis . Food provides transitory gratification . And , both food and food and people interactions are normally associated with deep feelings of security . So , food consumption is used symbolically to compensate . IF chronic anxiety or depression develops , THEN a person may become obsessed with the problem(s) and eat certain foods compulsively . These are defined as good because they provide immediate gratification . In order to serve this function , the eating experience must evoke a positive emotional/psychological response . This response may be evoked by a sensory attribute , e.g. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " chocoholic . " Or , the response may be evoked by an association , for example : ( a ) " I am cheating on my diet and getting away with it . " ? Fattening foods , i.e. , those that are sweet and/or rich are " good " for this purpose . ( b ) " I have been good . Therefore , I owe myself a treat . " ? Something sweet or expensive is " good " for this " lollipop mentality , " which is a holdover from childhood when an authority figure gave the child a lollipop for being good at the doctor 's office . ( c ) " I am eating this because everybody else does ; I know it is not good for me , but I want to be like everybody else . " ? All kinds of rich and salty snack foods are " good " for this purpose .  | ( d ) " My feelings are hurt and nobody loves me . It does n't matter what I look like . " ? A large bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so " good " that it disappears . ( e ) " I am just as good , strong , and brave as they ' are . " ? IF I eat heart , kidneys , and liver , THEN I will be strong like a lion . ( f ) " I almost starved to death during period X. " ? People who have been deprived of food on a continuing basis often will eat whatever they can obtain in order to become fat for the security of having calories to go on . ( g ) " I am really up tight . " ? People who are anxious with a feeling that makes them aware of an undifferentiated background stimulation that is unrelated to an identifiable sensation , perception , or thought also eat to compensate . They are " driven " to eat mindlessly , i.e. , they will eat whatever they can get and whenever they can get it . ( h ) " That was a real put-down . " ? Persons who have been degraded or feel unwanted often will eat steak or lobster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ( i ) " I should n't have said ( done ) that ; it was not right . I feel guilty about that but I can not bring myself to admit it to X. " ? Because they are later uncomfortable with what they have said or done , they may symbolically do penance by bringing a food gift from their garden or a homemade cake , pie , or cookies . They have to exert themselves to provide the food gift and have to go out of their way to present it , so they have made an effort without having to rectify , recompense , or reconcile . A number of other typical examples of compensatory eating and/or food and people interactions could be cited . However , these should be sufficient as " food for thought . " The attributes of a food may cause it to be regarded as poisonous , i.e. , something harmful or an object of aversion and abhorrence . Allergy or intolerance causes people to regard some foods as poisons . Associations put other people off . Within a culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of what is " good " or what is an appropriate color , texture , flavor , temperature , etc . A deviation from a standard evokes the response " What are you trying to feed me ? It is poisonous . " Blue mashed potatoes , slimy sour smelling hamburger , unfamiliar spices , and tepid coffee are examples of inappropriate attributes that evoke this response . Centuries ago , a sage stated , " It 's not what is that is , but what people think is that is . " Thus , it is not always undesirable attributes of a food that cause rejection but an association that evokes an emotional/psychological response causing a redefinition as poison . In this sense , " One man 's meat is another man 's poison . " And , a person will " lose his/her appetite " and/or " feel sick " ( nauseated ? " It turns the stomach " ) when  | presented with a " food " that is regarded as poison . The non-verbal response to even the thought of baked potato with sour cream and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or snake meat , illustrates this point . A number of other typical examples of poisons could be given . However , other bases for redefinition need to be considered . One of these relates to changes in the eating environment , as for example when a student goes away to college or when a person is hospitalized . These are major changes that disrupt many personal routines and challenge personal definitions of what is good in every aspect of life . A major emotional/psychological adjustment is required . A person is likely to be so busy dealing with the major stress that he/she is indifferent to food . Or , in the case of the college student , he/she may not be accustomed to planning for or procuring food ; he/she may lack the necessary skills and have to be content with whatever he/she can obtain . Or , he/she may not accept the difference in food quality in the food that is provided so may avoid some items or classes of food ; he/she may not be aware of diet quality deterioration as long as hunger is assuaged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees clearly that the definition of what is food has changed and can begin to adapt toward a balanced intake . In the case of a hospitalized patient , a stress related to the attributes of , or the choices of items available in , the eating experience when food quality is different , or the food and people interaction when eating in bed alone or with only a random acquaintance rather than family may evoke a range of emotional/psychological responses including suspicion , embarrassment , fear , anger , hostility , and rejection . At a time when nutrient intake is important to recovery or control or mitigation of a medical condition , emotional/psychological responses may intervene and interfere with acceptance of an appropriate definition of what is food . SOCIO-CULTURAL DEFINITION The socio-cultural definition of what is food encompasses the various aspects of the ecology of man 's social eating within the local cultural context . The terms social and cultural have a number of meanings with important implications that pertain to food and people interactions . Social means : ( a ) Marked by or passed in pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sociability . This aspect necessitates inclusion of the concepts of host , guest , hospitality , conviviality , comfortability , and congeniality as well as alone , lonely , lonesome , forlorn , and desolate .  | ( b ) Tending to form cooperative and interdependent relationships with one 's fellows ; gregarious . This aspect necessitates inclusion of the traditional group activities , e.g. , corn husking , canning and jam making , candy making , and pot luck suppers as well as contemporary ones , e.g. , progressive parties and food cooperatives. ( c ) Of or relating to human society , the interaction of the individual and the group , or the welfare of human beings as members of society . This aspect necessitates inclusion of the concepts of courtesy and table manners ; acceptable , appropriate , and inoffensive behavior. ( d ) Of , relating to , or based on rank or status in a particular society . This aspect necessitates inclusion of the concepts of appropriateness , competition , and rivalry . These are discussed in the section pertaining to cultural definitions . Culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired by intellectual and aesthetic training . This aspect necessitates inclusion of aesthetic definitions of what is food . This is to be discussed in a subsequent section . ( b ) A particular stage of advancement in civilization , the characteristic features of such a stage or state . This aspect necessitates inclusion of concepts of traditions in food for different occasions . ( c ) Behavior typical of a group or class . This aspect necessitates inclusion of concepts of sanctions applied in cases of mistakes and defiance and of barbarians . In the United States , we serve food at or in relation to essentially every kind of gathering of people . The definition of what is food is determined as a socio-cultural , often local , definition of what is appropriate . Generalizable considerations are that items will ( a ) create/maintain a pleasant , relaxed atmosphere , ( b ) not offend , and ( c ) be customary for the kind of occasion . These considerations are all related to the objective of evoking a positive emotional/psychological response in the collective food and people interactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of who , what , when , where , and how food will be served and eaten . These are transmitted among members of a cultural group by the same type of strategies and means used in teaching behavior patterns related to other aspects of life . Underlying Social Reasons Amicable , friendly , and genial are terms that describe relations that are expected to characterize social eating situations . The convivial host provides the hospitality , i.e. , receives and welcomes guests in a cordial manner and creates a pleasant or sustaining environment . The role of the host requires that one plan for the guest's ( s ' ) comfort .  | A large heterogeneous group introduces many unknowns , as people differ in what they define as food . Because of the uncertainty in this situation , the definition of what is food is customarily restricted to commonly accepted items in order to minimize the risk of giving offense . Food offered must not offend by being strange , shocking or horrifying , or causing pain ( physical or mental ) . In short , it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mildly stimulating , perhaps a conversation piece to be used as an " ice breaker . " On the other hand , a large homogeneous group is more manageable in the sense that there are fewer unknowns . But , a mistake in item selection is more noticeable because the food will remain uneaten and people will remark on that fact . A small heterogeneous group is also more manageable in the sense that there are fewer unknowns . But , IF a mistake is made in item selection , THEN it is likely to be noticeable when some individual(s) avoids the item(s) . The response of the host/hostess is reflexive ; an apology for the discomfort incurred is proffered immediately . A small homogeneous group is the most manageable , as there are few unknowns to deal with . The probability of a mistake in selection of foods offered is expected to be low . When it does occur , discomfort is correspondingly greater . Congeniality is managed by selection of persons for the guest list . When tastes are similar , the definition of what is good food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality must be acceptable and appropriate . IF strange , shocking , or a source of mental pain ( distaste ) , THEN comfort has been compromised and the eating experience fails socially . This is because one or more people become alone as a result of the difference between their definition of what is food and the quality that is presented . By nature , man is gregarious . IF a person is alone , i.e. , separated from others for any reason , especially on a continuing basis , THEN normal food and people interactions occur with a low frequency . The result is that the definition of what is food shrinks for reasons that include , but are not limited to : ( a ) The kinds of items prepared for one person and a group differ , e.g. , casseroles , quick breads , cakes , pies , and cobblers are prepared from recipes that make six or more portions and roast meats serve a dozen or so . These items drop out and are replaced by eggs , sandwiches , salads , ice cream , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The items that would have been prepared as a " labor of love " to please somebody else are avoided because they call forth painful memories . ( c ) The special foods that would be prepared/eaten in celebration of holidays , promotions , or other special occasions drop out unless the person is invited to join a group .  | ( d ) The quality of the eating experience is low , creating a degenerative spiral in which interest in eating decreases progressively and many an item drops out because the person does not think of it or can not bring himself/herself to make the effort to prepare it ; quick-fix and/or readyto-eat items remain . Loneliness and lonesomeness may restrict the food experience of people of any age ; the forlorn and desolate are usually elderly . IF a person is lonely , i.e. , apart from others with the implication that there are no others of the same kind around and the person longs for companionship so is sad and has feelings of bleakness or desolation , THEN in addition to the above , the person may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or may be unaware of what he/she is eating . IF a person is lonely , i.e. , sad and dejected as a result of a lack of companionship or separation from others and perceives existence to be dreary , THEN in addition to " a ? d " above , the person may compensate by eating sweet and/or rich items almost continuously . IF the person is forlorn , i.e. , apart from others and suffers miserably from a great sense of loss , or is desolate , i.e. , apart from others with a sharp and poignant sense of loneliness that results in behavior showing the effects of abandonment and neglect , THEN the person may refuse to eat . The cause rather than the effect of a restricted food array must be dealt with . Cooperative and interdependent food and people relationships are used to manage bigness and complexity , using a " divide and conquer " strategy . Many foods and many people can be served successively at a progressive party . A unique definition of what is food ( kinds , amounts , quality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular occasion , perhaps around a theme . The list of items is divided among participating hosts . A food co-op enables a group to purchase common items in bulk . These are cooperatively divided , packaged , and sold to members at a lower price . On " workdays " the members socialize while they work for the common good . Courtesy , or behavior marked by respect for and consideration of others , dictates that an alternate item be provided unobtrusively when a person can not eat one of the items served . In this way , the definition of what is food on the particular occasion is expanded to include special diet items , non-alcoholic beverages , etc . Table manners are one means to control the quality of interaction among members of a group for their general welfare as individuals . In a formal social situation , the concept of good table manners precludes noisy chewing or picking up food with the fingers . So , the definition of what is food is redefined to exclude relishes , e.g. , carrot and celery sticks , fried chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inelegant habits offend someone . On the other hand , in an informal social  | eating situation such as a picnic , such items are customary . Indeed , the definition of what is food is expanded to include as many items that can be eaten without the use of utensils as is possible . Variability in rank and status of the people , places , and things involved as well as in the occasion causes several kinds of redefinition of what is food in social eating situations such as dinner parties . For example , ( a ) Who the honored guest is may be the major factor in deciding what to serve , e.g. , when entertaining the boss , one serves food " fit for a king " whereas one may simply add another plate for a grandchild , nephew , or other relative . Moreover , some foods commonly served to the family would never be served to guests . ( b ) What the occasion is is another factor , e.g. , the usual items are served every day whereas familiar , acceptable but dressed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party or social gathering for dinner . ( c ) When a person shares a meal with another of differing rank or status , both must subordinate or suspend their personal definitions of what is food in order to preserve the relationship that brought them together . Otherwise , differences may come between the parties . ( d ) Where the particular dinner party is held may determine the definition of what is food . This is especially so when the meal is consumed in a commercial establishment . The rank and status of the restaurant are associated with its type , i.e. , fast-food versus exotic table service or some type in-between . Menu offerings delimit the definition of what is food ; these vary with the type of establishment . Therefore , when a steak tough as shoe leather and cold coffee are served in a high class French restaurant , the patrons react with shock and horror at the affront because such are not defined as food in these circumstances . ( e ) Why people give dinner parties , e.g. , to introduce a new person to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repay a social obligation may determine what is defined as food . When introducing a new person , some informality , certainly no stiffness or awkwardness , is desired . So , a buffet with spaghetti or other easy acceptable casserole is a common choice . To impress , the foods may require long painstaking preparation or be costly or rare or exotic . To repay a social obligation , the food is usually limited to items similar to those served previously by those being entertained as guests ? type , cost , and elaborateness should be similar in deference to feelings . Underlying Cultural Reasons The culturally defined definition of what is food for different occasions provides a basic list of items that are expected to be served . Occasions for  | which the definitions of what is food can be obtained include , but are not limited to , birthday party ; card party ; koffee klatch ; picnic ; wake ; dinner party , e.g. , Chinese , German , Hawaiian , Italian , Japanese , Mexican ; holiday dinner , e.g. , Christmas , Easter , Thanksgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develops in relation to food decoration , use of special optional ingredients in a creative way that adds interest . This aspect must be considered in the definition of what is food . Variation of this sort is approved and expected . Friendly rivalry of this sort is a social game used to introduce new status . Deviation , whether an unwitting mistake or in defiance , is not approved . To the newcomer , the distinction between variation and deviation may be unclear and result in the degrading designation of barbarian . Within a culture , people learn the boundaries of the definition of what is not food for every common circumstance , i.e. , what is poison because of some off-note that turns people off in such a way that they respond with " The very idea of eating X ! " In the United States , what is meat , i.e. , animal tissue used for food , is largely limited to muscular tissue . It is clearly defined and is known . There are also a number of " inedible " flesh foods that have been eaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of high quality animal protein . These are consumed by some subcultures that accept the items as meats . However , all of these items generally evoke a learned emotional/psychological response that has a socio-cultural basis . The items and presumed reasons for non-consumption are : ( a ) pig ( pork ) ? A gross animal that will eat whatever it can obtain ; in former times , it often ate garbage , which led to the idea that it is unclean . ( b ) dog , cat , horsemeat ? These have been domesticated as pets , which are friends . To eat a friend would be cannibalistic , so one withdraws in horror instinctively at the very idea of eating their flesh as meat . ( c ) wolf or coyote meat ? These are " bad animals " that kill sheep and other domestic animals ; ranchers loathe these animals . Also , these animals have been vilified in folk tales so they are rejected as a source of meat . ( d ) snakes , lizards , rodents , and insects ? Contact has created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people overreact with revulsion at the idea of eating such as meat . ( e ) game , e.g. , moose , elk , duck , rabbit , pheasant , deer , bear , squirrel ? People do not think of these as food ; unless one has access , and since the supply is seasonal , these are strange and therefore suspect . ( f ) organ meats , e.g. , tongue , heart , liver , kidneys , brains , tripe ? Muscles but not organs are accepted as food . Organs are basically repugnant because of texture , and we have undercut the beliefs that gave magical qualities and overcame natural aversion .  | ( g ) blood ? The thought of drinking warm blood , which is a highly nutritious beverage , causes one to withdraw in horror . ( h ) milk ? It is produced by all mammals but only cows ' , humans ' , and possibly goats ' milk are accepted . Others are strange and are considered suspect . Milk is the natural food for young mammals but it is rejected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) eggs ( hens ' and possibly ducks ' ) ? These are accepted as food although the eggs of other birds are nutritional equivalents . In addition to these reasons , some meats are not considered food because a person does not know how to cook them or does not think of them . And , flesh foods are avoided by vegetarians , as discussed elsewhere . Thus , flesh avoidances result from a variety of responses and derived rationale . Historically , there have been few taboos against eating plants other than those containing natural toxicants , which are avoided for health reasons . Some plants are comparatively rich in iron and/or protein but are not regarded as food . For whatever reason(s) , they are not grown commercially , so most people are not aware of their existence . Many of these were used by Native Americans and the settlers and now grow wild . Some that are used and could be used more extensively are nasturtium leaves , chrysanthemum leaves and buds , geranium leaves , dandelion leaves , poke , purslane , lamb 's quarters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they cause flatulence , which is socially embarrassing . Therefore , consumption by most Americans is limited to outside occasions . Other items are not defined as food by some people under defined circumstances . These are avoided because of degrading associations . These foods are avoided because they are for ( a ) low class people , ( b ) children , ( c ) sick people , or ( d ) old people . Clearly , there are many factors that may determine the definition of what is food . Learning Definitions of Food and Poison The definitions of food and poison are part of our general cultural heritage of foodways . They are transmitted to succeeding generations by mothers and other parent figures by means of the same types of strategies and actions used in teaching behavior patterns related to other aspects of life . A system of rewards and punishment is used to encourage desired behavior . The following aspects are commonly taught : ( a ) What is food , when to eat what , where to eat what , why eat , how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. ) ( b ) How much variety to expect within and among meals , by the example of what is provided . IF the food array is restricted by prejudice  | or economics , THEN children will have a restricted definition of what is food . The expected outcome is that children then will refuse to eat unfamiliar items , or at least they will be reluctant to try them . ( c ) What is nutritious ? items and what cluster of foods make up a balanced diet . IF one is knowledgeable about the nutrient contributions of various foods AND values consumption of a nutritious diet , THEN the nutrition information , attitudes , and associated behaviors he/she teaches will program a child for good nutrition later . Otherwise , the child will learn adages , attitudes , and behaviors that belittle the value of a nutritious diet . In our mobile society , children have other learning experiences that program them nutritionally . IF a family is mobile and has to adjust to a difference in ingredient availability , price , or differences in regional food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , THEN the child learns to be adaptable and somewhat more catholic ( universal ) in tastes . At least four expected outcomes have been identified : ( a ) IF the change is sudden or drastic , THEN the family may not make a perfect adaptation so maladaptation results in less optimal nutritional status than previously . ( b ) IF the change is slow and gradual , THEN nutritional status is likely to be stable at the normal level for the family . ( c ) IF frequent changes are required , THEN the requirement for adaptations may exceed the capacity to cope and nutritional status may degenerate rapidly . ( d ) IF the family regards changes as an opportunity for an eating adventure and recognizes the need to study the effects of item changes on nutrient intake , THEN necessary changes will be accepted more easily and unwanted effects will be minimized . Children in a mobile family are more vulnerable nutritionally than their peers . They can not evaluate the effects of so many complex factors . Lack of continuity in diet and inability to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and/or incorrect concepts and habits . So , the child is less likely to redefine what is food in such a way that he/she chooses a balanced diet . The child needs both support and assistance in balancing the diet during the transitional phase while new habits are being formed . Lacking this , the child is likely to develop habits of food choice that are nutritionally unwise . The adult who has grown up in a mobile family or who has moved from one region to another and has not given thought to changes in food intake may be nutritionally vulnerable . This is because of the cumulative and aggregate effects of failure to unlearn , or of incomplete and/or incorrect past learning . For example , people who live on a farm are accustomed to eating a variety of home-grown fruits and vegetables . These are eaten  | because they are available , customary , and enjoyed . When farm people move to urban areas , fresh fruits and vegetables are often no longer defined as food because of quality and availability differences . Moreover , purchase price is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost . Commercially preserved forms are not substituted , so fruits and vegetables drop out of the diet of many . Of course , the nutritional quality of the diet suffers . But , often people do not recognize that such important changes have occurred in their diet , nor could they explain why . Expected effects are completely beyond them . Thus , people who have moved from one area to another need help in redefining what is food so as to retain the nutritional quality of their diet . HEALTH-RELATED DEFINITIONS " Good health ! " ? in every culture , one of the most common traditional rituals at a social gathering ? is the proposing of this toast , first to the host and then to all gathered . Everybody can drink to this toast , which unites all with good wishes . The concept of good health has three aspects : ( a ) the person gives the appearance of and is free from signs of disease , weakness , or malfunction ; ( b ) the person behaves in a way that demonstrates full strength and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person has a sense of physical and mental well-being . From earliest times , man has perceived that food intake was related to health , i.e. , consumption of the right food might remedy a disease whereas consumption of a poison might cause a disease . Man also learned that the possibility of demonstrating full strength and vigor was influenced by something inherent in the food itself , i.e. , by nutrient intake , rather than food intake per se since consumption of different diets has different effects on health . And , sense of well-being was linked to man 's perception of the relationship between food ecology and life expectancy . The question has been asked , " Who eats for health ? " The answer is , those who ( a ) Have a chronic disease and must modify and/or control food consumption in order to remedy the condition or mitigate symptoms . ( This group also includes the incurable who are seeking a miracle. ) ( b ) Opt to prevent or delay onset of symptoms by modifying food consumption to balanced moderation . ( c ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises improvement . ( d ) Are losing or have lost a sense of well-being , e.g. , the elderly who seek to recapture the strength of youth or members of the counterculture who seek health .  | Everybody eats or avoids certain foods on a temporary basis during an acute illness . Thus , at some time or other , everybody eats for health . It turns out that many persons in the first two groups have a rational basis in eating for health . The challenge in improving the nutriture of persons in these categories is to reach them with accurate information , assistance , and support so that they can accept personal responsibility for monitoring and control of their food intake . An appropriately modified definition of what is nutritious food , given physical limitations , is the basis for health maintenance . Many persons in the latter categories eat for health on the basis of affective or emotional criteria . Food fads and cults are common among people in these categories . The challenge in this case is to improve diet intake without giving offense , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nutritious food , given beliefs , is the basis for health maintenance . The mentality of a people determines the level at which they perceive and attempt to deal with health-related aspects of their life-style . Food ecology is closely related to the mentality and life-style of a person . For some , health is a blessing that they pray for because they fear that poor health will prevent happiness . People with this mentality often do not take the necessary actions in redefining what is food to assure a basis for health . Others feel that they are at the mercy of disease , which is a disaster that strikes randomly with appalling devastation . People with this mentality often adopt an attitude of utter hopelessness which precludes implementation of an assertive health maintenance program that includes diet control . Some people respond to any decrease in physical strength with a sharp decrease in sense of well-being ; they feel abandoned . They will grasp at anything that appears to have promise in regaining vigor . So , unwittingly they may redefine what is food in a way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of health is inextricably bound to a cult of the body . The quality of the observed food intake is determined by the quality of sources of food and nutrition information used . Use of a nutritionist is likely to lead to a nutritionally valid definition of what is food , which may improve physical capacity . Use of a quack is likely to lead to a nutritionally invalid definition of what is food , which may create a physical stress and/or waste money . In recent years , there has been increasing evidence that the American people perceive unmet needs in relation to the way to eat for health . The number of courses , lectures , books , and articles on one aspect or another is phenomenal . Still , the demand is insatiable and people do not feel secure in their knowledge . The " Establishments " have not dealt effectively with the need to eat p 300 for health . They provide some limited kinds of information in a fragmented way , for example : ( a ) The " Nutrition Establishment " provides information on normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People learn about these in order to have some intellectual understanding of nutrition . ( b ) The " Food Processing Establishment " provides some information on the nutritional value of foods , food processing methods , and the role of food additives. ( c ) The " Health Care Establishment " provides some information on preventive and curative diets , and special foods to be used . Still , these inputs are not sufficient and are not used systematically in making daily food choices for health and people are uncomfortable . So , many have turned to the person employed in health food stores for help . The lure of profit from the gullible encourages the glib to present their irresistible sales pitches . Thus , in good faith , many are enticed into spending large sums on innocuous and/or worthless foods that have been redefined as possessing some special value . Therapeutic Diet Definitions Diet therapy is used in prevention and/or control/cure of disease . It results in need for modification of food and people interactions , food experiences , food attributes , and food consumption behavior . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by application of a remedy . Terms with related connotations and implications are : ( a ) remedy ? A diet that relieves or corrects for effects of a disease ( within an involved tissue ) or disorder ( some effect , e.g. , high blood pressure , glucosuria , hyperlipidemia ) ( b ) relieve ? Lift a burden to make it tolerable ( c ) alleviate ? Temporary or partial lessening of distress ( d ) mitigate ? Moderate or counteract the effect of something painful ( e ) cure ? To restore to health , soundness , and normality ( implies per-manence ) There are different types of modified diets for different conditions and levels of restriction that vary with the severity of the condition . The concept of modify includes , but is not limited to , the following aspects : ( a ) to make less extreme ? As when a person who habitually consumes a high fat diet must reduce fat intake to a moderate level ( b ) to limit or restrict the meaning of and suggests a difference that limits , restricts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has habitually consumed a salty rich diet must follow a low fat-low calorie diet until sufficient weight is lost that the gall bladder can be removed  | ( c ) to make a minor change in ? As when an ulcer patient is instructed to eat mid-morning , mid-afternoon , and bedtime snacks ( d ) to make a basic or important change in ? As in diabetes where the simple CHO content must be greatly restricted and the complex CHO content must be adjusted Use of a modified diet requires changes . In this context , change means to make different in some particular(s) and may imply whatever level of variation , whether affecting some aspect of the food domain essentially or superficially . An essential difference amounts to a loss of original identity in one or more aspects of the food domain , i.e. , that aspect is transformed or has a new direction . The magnitude of the change depends on the magnitude of the aspect changed . A superficial difference leads to substitution or replacement of one food/interaction by another , e.g. , to exchange one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two extremes are a number of levels of change . These include , but are not limited to : ( a ) permutation ? Transposition within a group of otherwise unchanged items , as in preventive modifications that are not followed rigorously . ( b ) mutation ? An inevitable change that lacks permanence and stability . This change is observed when people have distress from foods X , Y , Z , and Q. These may drop in and out of the diet or be replaced by other foods . The observed diet is usually very close to the customary since the effects of a few items are not far-reaching . ( c ) major change ? Either a transformation or a new direction . This is difficult and requires strong nutritional counseling . Many aspects of the food and people interactions may have to be changed in diseases such as ulcers , diabetes ( maturity onset ) , and kidney failure . ( d ) radical change ? Either a transformation or a new direction of a magnitude great enough to constitute a reversal of what had been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat , high salt to low sodium , etc . This is very difficult and requires effective and continued nutritional counseling . Both major and radical changes require extensive redefinition of what is food and what is poison and involve adjustment to changes in food attributes ( color , texture , flavor , etc. ) , eating frequency and spacing of meals , size of meals , eating territory , and satisfactions resulting from food and people interactions . Counseling is needed to salvage as much positive reward as possible , given the new reality . It is used to assist the individual in returning to former health state and normal food and people interactions , to the extent possible . It provides suggestions for ways to lift the burdens of the dietary constraints via individualization of the diet , to the extent possible . Counseling seeks to assist individuals in  | compliance so as to reduce the probability of a recurrent episode and/or increase the probability of a return to a normal diet . It also provides guidance to assist individuals in returning to social eating in public , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow up with a vague awareness that adults and/or some children have some " condition " which requires that they may be served special foods or not served other foods . The " condition " for which such definitions are generally available include obesity , ulcers , diabetes , " heart trouble , " and indigestion . Gradually , everybody acquires a definition of what is food and what is poison for each of these " conditions . " These definitions are acquired piecemeal and out-of-context distortions occur . Unfortunately , the definitions are known and accepted and interfere with instruction by qualified professionals . Some " conditions " require continuous adherence to a reasonably restricted definition of what is food in order to remain symptom-free or to avoid a catastrophe . Acceptance of personal responsibility is a necessity , but requires self-discipline . Some subcultures have not accepted the concept of delayed gratification . Members from these subcultures will have two alternate definitions of what is food , which will be used alternately according to level of pain . These are : ( a ) the restricted definition , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ( b ) the usual subculture definition of what is food , which is indulged in during relatively asymptomatic periods . Continuing instruction is necessary to help individuals make a more appropriate adjustment for health . When a diet has been prescribed , initial instruction provides definition of what is food and poison for most people . Because of individual differences in food ecology , additional and perhaps continuing instruction is necessary to individualize the definition of food and poison , to retain the quality of the eating experience , and to minimize disruption of food and people interactions . This is necessary in order to maintain long-term adherence and well-being ; professional assistance should be sought . Preventive Diet Definitions The concept of a preventive diet to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes was introduced to the general public in the late 1960s . Whether an individual is at risk and whether diet modification will prevent one of these catastrophic events is unknowable for an individual . For the population-as-a-whole , the fact that risk is reduced has been established . So , many people have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only a few foods are excluded . The emphasis is on making choices on a continuing basis so that the total intake of cholesterol , saturated fatty  | acids , and/or salt is below a defined daily limit . Particulars of a simplified pattern called " The Prudent Diet , " discussed in Chapter 24 , are quite restrictive but if one is willing to take the time , the definition need not be so narrow . Body-Building Definitions The masculine ideal of a strong , healthy , well developed body has been sought by teenage boys and men of every generation since the Golden Age of Greece when perfection of physical prowess was an obsession . Physical fitness programs have been revalued and revitalized since the 1960s finding that Americans were physically unfit due to a sedentary life-style . Men were encouraged to improve physical fitness in order to decrease risk of heart disease and physical exercise was advocated as a means to weight control . And , increasingly , women began to seek a healthy physique . Control of food intake and a restricted definition of what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early times . The definition of what is food seemingly always has been an important issue , with many differing opinions among coaches and athletes . The decrees of the local coach(es) usually redefine what is food for the athlete in training . The idiosyncrasies of some nationally or internationally famous athlete(s) may result in a transitory redefinition of what is food as aspiring athletes imitate their idol in a faddish way . From the scientific standpoint , the definition of what is food for bodybuilding must be determined by the nutritional requirements of the individual as established by a biochemical evaluation of circulating levels of nutrients . Then lists of rich sources of needed nutrient(s) can be used as a basis for food choice . In this way , the definition of what is food can be modified to provide needed nutrients . No particular food is essential or possesses special virtue . It is only a better or poorer source of a needed nutrient(s) , given the quantity consumed . During training , protein ( amino acid ) needs are increased in the early stages while muscles are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( any red meat , fish , poultry , or carefully chosen mixture of plant proteins can be used ) is greater . After that , a normal maintenance quantity ( RDA ) suffices . Strenuous exercise inflates the need for fluids and salts that are lost in sweat . These must be supplied for replacement . Many items may be defined as food for this purpose . Public awareness of " body-building " foods is maintained by advertising slogans such as " Wonder Bread Builds Strong Bodies 12 Ways " or   " Every Body Needs Milk . " Advocates of foods from each food group develop catch-phrases for this purpose . Youth-Seeking Definitions Approximately 15% of the American population lives to age 65 or older . Aging is accompanied by a decreased sense of well-being . As one becomes infirm , i.e. , no longer strong enough to endure strain , pressure , or strenuous effort , and then feeble , i.e. , almost totally lacking in strength , a panic may evolve . These natural outcomes are repugnant in a society that glorifies youth . So many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that promises the " Fountain of Youth . " There is some evidence that some of the elderly have special difficulty in facing the normal fears , anxieties , and insecurities of old age and death . A crisis evolves since some ideologies do not deal with these aspects and to resort to religion would require an about-face that would be shattering to beliefs and self-concept . The solution to these problems that has been adopted by many has been the use of megadoses of selected vitamins . These are believed to postpone the effects of the aging process and ward off disease . For the elderly of this persuasion , the definition of what is food has been expanded to include large quantities of vitamin supplements . Other items such as bone meal , tiger 's milk , kelp , carrot and kraut juices , and bran capsules also have been added to the definition of what is food . Moreover , within memory of the elderly , many old people routinely took tonics and drank tisanes for health and comfort . When all else fails , many revive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is food . Indeed , such items may be infused with and invested with magical properties in restoring health and vigor . So , these are reinstated with a primary role . Thus , a tonic of sulfur and molasses ( contemporary equivalent is Geritol ) and various herbal teas are expected to have value and are consumed in hope . The observed euphoria , i.e. , an often unaccountable feeling of well-being or elation , becomes understandable . When the elderly have established this link between their past , in dealing with present infirmities and in warding off future disease , they can experience a good feeling of accomplishment . Thus , a redefinition of what is food and drink can rekindle a sense of well-being . Counterculture Health-Seeking Definitions A health food diet works , i.e. , it leads to improved health of those who follow it . How can this be ? The answer is simple :  | ( a ) A health food diet is based on foods of known nutritional quality , i.e. , fresh meat , dairy products , fruits and vegetables , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a combination of these in a simpler diet . The increased bulk causes people to feel full on a smaller quantity of food that also contains fewer calories . Such a diet avoids the common excesses that result from consumption of unsatisfying but enticing foods made from refined cereals and sugar . ( c ) Greater interest in and knowledge of nutrition combined with religious , i.e. , scrupulously and conscientiously faithful , control of intake . Together , these factors create and maintain a definition of what is food that leads to good health . Success in improving physical health naturally leads to a more positive mental outlook , even euphoria . The need for internal balance and harmony has long been recognized as essential to good health . Since ancient times , man has believed that food has medicinal value , i.e. , it can be used in treating disease ? to alleviate or cure it and to relieve pain ? and to improve one 's sense of well-being . Bark , leaves , seeds , and roots are known to contain some substances that have healing power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ albeit crudely , to remove the active principle and make them more convenient to use . So , some plant materials are dried and powdered and others are extracted . An infusion has been made from others and the liquid is drunk as tea . Still others , being used mainly for food , also have an effect ; these traditionally have been classified as " hot " or " cold . " This classification redefined usage or what is food for ( a ) certain people , e.g. , old , sick , or weak and ( b ) certain circumstances , e.g. , pregnancy , confinement , and lactation and a whole array of temporary minor illnesses such as flu , stomachache , and evil eye . The effects of " hot " diseases were believed to be alleviated by taking " cold " foods and vice versa , since these were believed to reestablish internal balance . Acute Illness Definitions Most people grow up with some vague memories that when they were sick with X ( a common acute minor illness ) , they were served Y but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among people ; the common list of items has evolved from common experience . The items differ from place to place due to historical differences in availability . A few examples are listed below for illustration : ( a ) nausea , vomiting , or stomachache ? Y = dry toast , tea , plain carbonated beverage , gelatin dessert ( b ) diarrhea ? Y = tea and toast , carrot soup , chipped ice , boiled skim milk //  | ( c ) flu or common cold ( starve a cold and feed a fever ) ? Y = chicken soup , milk toast , orange juice , fluids , whiskey and honey , honey horehound drops ( d ) mumps ? Y = chicken soup , ice cream ; J = pickles , other sour foods Learning Definitions of What Is Food for Health Like other culturally defined aspects of the definitions of food and poison , the health-related portion is in part absorbed and in part carefully taught by means of the common system of rewards and punishment . The process begins early . Everybody values a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation in which the children will eat what they consider to be a healthful diet . A number of common phrases are used to impress upon the child the importance of eating X ( an unwanted food ) , so one hears : ( a ) " Eat your meat so you will be strong . " ( b ) " Eat your spinach ; it 's good for you . " ( c ) " Drink your milk so you will have strong bones and teeth . " ( d ) " You need your vitamins every day . Come on , chew it up . That 's a good boy . " ( e ) " Eat your liver so you will be strong like a lion . " Even mothers who pay little or no attention to their own food intake are careful to buy baby meat , strained fruits and vegetables , and egg yolks for their babies . And , so it goes . In a well meaning effort to be sure that the baby is well fed , some parents poison their babies with too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice , which is dilute . It fills the stomach but does not provide enough nourishment for the volume , so the baby is unsatisfied and continues to cry with hunger . It expands capacity and keeps food in the mouth ; dental caries in erupting teeth result . When too much solid food is given , the baby becomes fat , which programs it for later problems . What is needed is balance . See Chapter 26 . School children become " junk-food junkies " as a result of an abundant supply of and free access to candy , soft drinks , and cookies . Peanuts , chips , ice cream , and other items also are staples of the diet . This definition of what is food is sweet , rich , and high in calories and little else . But , ten years of experience on this diet teaches the child many things . See Chapter 27 . The teenager learns more about food and health since physical demands for growth greatly inflate needs and appetite , concern with shape leads to body-building and/or weight control regimens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All of these aspects expand the teenager 's consciousness of the health-related defini- tions of food and poison , as he/she attempts to conform to a defined diet rather than simply eating whatever is prepared and served in the home or is generally available . Typically , the teenager tries a variety of diets , so experience with redefinition of what is food for health can be considerable . Peers and popular literature are main sources of information about what is food for health under a variety of circumstances . See Chapter 28 . Normally , the primary health-related definitions of what are food and poison to be learned by young adults pertain to pregnancy and feeding of infants and children . Everybody , e.g. , relatives , friends , and neighbors , frequently share opinions and repeat experiences as object lessons . Popular literature is also studied . From the process of sifting through this often conflicting information , a personalized definition of what is food emerges . See Chapter 29 . During the middle and later years , the personalization of the healthrelated definition of food and poison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preventive diet , and/or requires a therapeutic diet . A general accretion of common knowledge of the definition of food and poison for common acute illnesses also occurs . Normally , bit by bit the basic definitions formed at earlier periods are refined to meet new needs . See Chapters 30 and 31 . From early teenage years on , popular literature can have an important effect in redefining what is food and poison in relation to health . The half-truths that are presented and accepted are likely to be those portions of truth that are closest to what is already believed . The other half is beyond what one can understand ; it may be there , but it is not revealed . It is in this way that people selectively learn or reinforce what they know . Research has shown that people are more likely to select what they pay attention to because of the beliefs they have rather than base their belief systems and behavior on what they have just heard or read ? nobody can change that fast and that consistently . IF this is so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have become health faddists ? Consider the following : ( a ) most adults remember that they were healthy as children and ( b ) when most adults or their parents were young , food technology was not so advanced so food was processed less and did not contain the food additives that are commonly added today . In contemporary society , people are confronted with symptoms of poor health and/or reason to question food quality from the standpoint of health and safety . Since many people 's beliefs about what is food were formed before food technology was so advanced or in a home where preparation from " scratch " was highly valued , it is reasonable to suppose that given uncertainty about health , some people will be receptive to the health  | food literature because it fits with long-held beliefs . Moreover , the fact that the beliefs were formed at a time when the person was healthy seems to confirm the suspicion that the simpler diet was healthier . This , then , is the basis on which a seemingly abrupt change can be made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be explained similarly . Many adults from the various subcultures have grown up with some awareness that an older relative recommended X for " condition " Y and it worked . X is only half-remembered ; but what is remembered is the resulting satisfaction . The impersonality of today 's medical practice does not meet people 's affective needs in times of stress in a society where many are anonymous and alone . Therefore , it is reasonable to suppose that given symptoms of poor health , some people will be receptive to a return to the use of food as medicine . ECONOMIC DEFINITIONS Seemingly food always has been considered to be costly ; some foods such as salt were even precious in times past . And , food prices have been a major topic of discussion for centuries . Almost everybody has a mental idea of what the price of food X " should " be compared with what it is and what he/she " will " afford to pay for food X , irrespective of what he/she " can " pay . Therefore , IF the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THEN it usually will not be purchased . The effects may be a temporary excluding from the definition of what is food , as in the case of foods with seasonally fluctuating prices . For example , meat , fruit , and vegetable prices are highly variable but the foods can be obtained year-round , e.g. , strawberries may have to be flown in at $3.50 a quart in December . Or , the effects may be permanent , e.g. , Salmon Loaf was served frequently when canned salmon was 590 per can but since the price has been beyond $1.25 , it has been considered prohibitive . In affluent America , most people can afford to purchase sufficient quantities of a reasonable variety of foods of good quality . Still , economic definitions affect everybody 's food choices . In general , younger and older people differ in their expectations of and experiences with food prices and these factors affect their definition of what is food . Differing priorities at different stages of the life cycle also affect the definition of what is food . Some people can not afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what is food is a common concomitant effect . Clearly , cost may be either a primary ( critical variable ) in the definition of what is food and the food choice decision-making process , or it may be one of a cluster of factors that together determine the decision outcome . People appear to evaluate the cost of food simultaneously on two  | different scales . On the normative scale , the cost of an item is judged in comparison with the costs of other items in the same food class , e.g. , the cost of hamburger is compared with that of chicken or T-bone steak . On the ipsatiue scale , the cost of an item is judged against itself at several points in time , starting with its cost at a base period , e.g. , the cost of hamburger when one was a bride is compared with its current cost . Relative positions on both scales enter the decision-making process . However , the weights used depend on the age of the purchaser and food budget priorities . Thus , when somebody says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't afford it anymore , " the interpretation hinges on knowledge of the relative cost of alternate items as well as other demands of the person 's food budget . Economic Definitions When One Has Comfortable Means Differing expectations concerning the cost of various foods is one independent factor that probably accounts for part of the differences between a younger and an older person 's economic definition of what is food . It seems likely that because today 's young people have generally grown up during a relatively affluent period , they can accept current prices of many foods as reasonable . And , they are more willing to purchase what they want , at what it costs . Since they have enough money , they can budget what is required . On the other hand , older persons generally grew up in a poverty or war-restricted period when both money and food were scarce , and prices were considerably lower . They feel virtuous when they feel that they can resist the impulse to purchase high-cost foods . Their hesitation is ingrained ; they are not comfortable with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever it costs . Although they often have enough money and can budget what is required , they are reluctant to do so . And , they expect lower prices and are generally outraged with the price of many foods . Prices have not risen uniformly . So , those foods whose prices have risen most are targets for the outrage and are removed from the definition of what is food . Differing experience with food prices is another independent factor that probably accounts for part of the differences in younger and older persons ' definition of what is food . It appears that older people may be less willing to accept the continually rising price spiral as a normal outcome . They can remember when the price of food X was a nickel a pound ; in their experience , this price is reasonable . No amount of explanation can reconcile them to the fact that the current high price is an outrage . They know that their income has risen and they read that personal disposable income has increased . But , these facts do not matter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the price of food X is  | " too much . " So , this means that food X must be regarded as too expensive to be afforded . Younger women do not respond to current prices in the same way . This is because their experience is different . The purchase price at the time they started purchasing food X already was elevated , so the observed price rise is not yet too much . But , unless prices stabilize , the price of food X will reach a level that evokes the same response . Except for the affluent , in order to meet expenses , people must set different spending priorities at the different periods of the life cycle . As a result , in some periods , the amount budgeted for food may be absolutely and/or relatively low in relation to other aspects of life-style . The resulting constraints on the definition of what is food may produce feelings of frustration , guilt , and anger . Thus , the incongruity creates a major conflict when it comes together with economic realities and results in feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the launching period , young people must ( a ) initiate purchase of basic household goods , ( b ) acquire a business wardrobe , and ( c ) start a family ? on an income that is probably at its lifetime lowest . Life-style determines the level or quality of demands and thus associated costs . A higher income may not mean that more money is available for food . Sufficient money must be allocated for lunches and entertaining to maintain a socially acceptable food and people interaction front . But , behind this one may see that the amount budgeted for food is shockingly little ? whatever is left . So , food is " gold " and the definition of what is food may be restricted to the less expensive cuts of meat which are extended when served , nuts and dairy products , and carbohydrate fillers . Fruits and vegetables may be too expensive to be used other than as treats . During the coasting period , adults in the middle years must ( a ) complete purchase of original household goods and initiate replacement , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( c ) meet growing expenses of children 's developmental education and experiences with an income that is climbing toward its lifetime maximum point . Here again , life-style determines the level or quality of demands and so the associated costs . Increasingly , during this stage the amount of money available for food rises . Sufficient money is available for and is allocated for lunches and entertainment that fit with life-style . Usually , the amount budgeted for food is relatively much greater . Food is still " gold " ; however , the definition of what is food has been expanded to reinclude steaks , roasts , chops , fruits , vegetables , and other items formerly consumed during childhood and teenage years in the family home . As income expands , the less expensive items progressively drop out of the diet and are replaced by more highly valued and higher cost items since increasingly it is economically feasible to define them as food . Feelings of deprivation become //  | only a memory . Luxuries that formerly were only dimly perceived on a distant horizon now become almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spending priorities are rearranged to optimize satisfaction , given values and life-style . It seems that IF food is not an important source of satisfaction , THEN whatever definition of food applied in the preceding period is likely to continue . IF food becomes a major source of satisfaction , THEN its priority rises to its lifetime maximum and the definition of what is food will expand to include whatever is desired . So , food is " gold " and one enjoys its richness . During the has-been period , which is highly variable in length from a few years to several decades , a sharply reduced income forces people to again redefine what is food within newly imposed economic limits . IF sufficient money is available , THEN a socially acceptable food and people interaction front may be maintained . But , often the amount of money available for food is shockingly little . So , food is " gold " and the definition of what is food is often sharply and painfully restricted to cheap and somewhat filling items . Loss in the economic sphere adds feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of aloneness of the elderly . Another factor having an independent effect on the economic definition of what is food is advertising . Advertising is deliberately designed to create/maintain wants as well as to entice and tantalize . Carefully designed messages with multiple meanings that appeal differently to different segments of a reader/listener audience are disseminated via radio , TV , and magazines . These messages expand consciousness of alternate definitions of what is food to include similar items . This progressively expands the size of the food array and the want list . Unfortunately , when wants are created ahead of economic capability/access , then frust ration and anger result . The mentality of those with comfortable means and the mentality of the poor differ . As a result , there are different expectations/experiences in regard to food , eating , and the food and people interaction . These differences must be understood in order to respond appropriately to behavior of persons in both groups . Economic Definition of the Poor The level of uncertainty the poor have to live with makes a future orientation ridiculous . They can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variables that are beyond their control . In the resulting ecosystem , the definition of what is food reflects the " now " orientation , which is part of an appropriate adjustment mechanism that makes the deprived food and people interaction tolerable . Until now , attempts to change this situation have failed .  | When the poor get a little money , they buy food and have a feast ; between times , they may almost starve . So , efforts have been made to persuade the poor to allocate money received intermittently in such a way that a slightly better diet will be consumed on a continuing basis . The poor refuse to cooperate because a feast provides hope , relief from the monotony of a limited variety of foods , and the satisfactions of achievement . On the other hand , they perceive that a more uniform allocation might result in a somewhat better diet nutritionally , but that it would not be significantly different in terms of the items defined as food so it would still be monotonous and unsatisfying . Moreover , they would no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , this system would be impractical because other demands would take the money away from food anyway . So , it is not worth the effort . It is for this reason that all enlightened contemporary proposals to help the poor obtain a better diet require that they be given enough money to obtain a basic level of other goods and services . The definition of what is food can not rise above its minimum subsistence level to something with a potential of meeting nutritional needs when the level of other goods and services is similarly low . The money is simply spent on the other items . When people consume a subsistence diet in the midst of a society where the majority have comfortable means , the poor are more aware of their deprivations than they would be in a society where nearly everybody shares the common lot . So , the poor covet the foods they can not afford . And , their desires , which are fanned by advertising , become an obsession until they just must have food X , no matter what . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other luxuries with their Food Stamps . Public awareness results in expressions of outrage and demands for punitive action . Still , the " abuse " continues and it probably always will . When people have a fixed low income , they accept the restricted definition of what is food as something they have to live with since they have no hope of obtaining luxuries . They do this by reducing awareness . However , when people are given hope in the form of expanded food purchasing power , acceptance gives way to desire which frustrates them until they purchase the item(s) . Under these changed circumstances , the accepted definition of what is food is rejected . A new definition emerges to take advantage of the expanded purchasing power in gratifying repressed desires . So , initially , a person on Food Stamps may feast . But , the reality of the continuation of the expanded food purchasing power is soon realized . Then , the wide swings of the feast or famine mode tend to even out toward the planned outcome of a nutritionally better diet . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse " of Food Stamps also can be observed : mothers use precious Food Stamps to obtain candy and soft drinks for the children . Here again , the explanaWHAT //  | tion is simple and reasonable ? on an occasional basis . At the subsistence level , a mother has difficulty in supplying rewards for desired behavior . Since food is scarce and is served monotonously , any variation takes on added significance . Everybody in the family , including very small children , know this . So , IF precious food money has been spent for candy or soft drinks , THEN the sense of satisfaction generated is all out of proportion to the monetary cost and thereby enables the food to serve as an important reward . The poor long have had reduced purchasing power which has had a long-term effect on their definition of what is food . It is essentially limited to staples . Some rich sources of nutrients are not included in the definition of what is food because their absolute cost is too high . Many other foods that are good sources also are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be surprising that the nutritional quality of their diet is low . To improve nutritional quality , some of these foods must be consumed regularly . But , for most people an unknown food is rejected as readily as a disliked one . Therefore , unless steps are taken to correct the definition of what is food , increased purchasing power will not necessarily result in improved nutriture . It is for this reason that nutrition education , including the introduction of new foods , is a mandatory component of federal food programs . But , the solution to this problem creates another : IF one expands a person 's consciousness of alternate foods in order to expand the definition of what is food , THEN one has changed the eating experience and has created an acquired need for the food(s) introduced . Unless access is provided simultaneously and on a continuing basis , dissatisfaction results and provides the seeds for rebellion . For this reason , control of the definition of the food of a people has political as well as economic importance ; food is power . Unlooked-for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is appealing and evokes gleeful exclamations . Everybody exults when food is obtained by giveaways or bargains . A windfall makes one jubilant . Whenever food is available free or at a cost below the going prices , especially when below the real value of it , the definition of what is food is adjusted to utilize the new item(s) to best advantage . A new item ( introductory offer ) or version ( different brand ) of a familiar item may be introduced into the food array by this means . Or , because of supply , frequency of consumption may be increased markedly . As long as supply lasts , which ordinarily is not that long , advantage overcomes the tendency to become tired of a perishable item that must be consumed intensely before it spoils . During the harvest season , this effect of the economic definition of what food is  | AESTHETIC DEFINITIONS The assessment of aesthetic quality is based on a psychological evaluation of the physical properties of foods , i.e. , it is a psychophysical evaluation of appropriateness and composition . Color , texture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are evaluated for appropriateness . Composition of the plate and meal are evaluated on the bases of topography , neatness , quantity of food , harmony of attributes , and emphasis . Ornamentation is evaluated with respect to taste . In the United States , we value artistic ability in a cook , i.e. , showing taste in arrangement or execution , from the point of view of the cook who thinks in terms of creating beauty or form . But , most Americans are resigned to the fact that the majority of cooks make only a token effort to be artistic , e.g. , they add something green , usually parsley , to the plate . On the other hand , as consumers we are highly variable in terms of the importance we place on aesthetic quality , i.e. , assessment of beauty , from the point of view of one who analyzes and reflects upon the effect a work of art has upon him . Unless the cook is superb and evokes a response to his/her art , most of us focus on utilitarian aspects unless the food has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and what is good is culturally determined . Each culture has its own scale of values for each quality ; both scale factors and values are known . In some cultures , especially Japanese , perfection can be obtained only by a few ? freshness and top color , texture , and flavor are prized . In the United States , we value what has been derisively called " uniform mediocrity " ? a standard that is less than perfection but attainable almost everywhere , most of the time . Aesthetic values change with technological capabilities . The American standard for fruits and vegetables requires uniformity in size and color , which has been made possible by sizing and grading . Artificial colors and flavors are commonly added to foods to adjust color and flavor to a standardized level . Deviation from standard is a recognized defect that detracts from aesthetic quality . The accept/reject decision is based on attributes and composition . Attributes Foods are the source of nutrition . . . Since their nutritive properties are taken for granted , food items are not bought primarily on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well they are liked . While price and ease of use are interwoven in the fabric of food purchase , the inherent sensory properties of the food item are the primary determinants of its acceptance . How does it look ? How does it smell ? How does it taste ? If the response to these questions is " O.K. " or " all right , " then acceptance will result . For acceptance implies neutrality : there is  | nothing particularly wrong with a product . Better yet , if the response to the question of looks , smell , and taste is " good " or " I like it " or " my family likes it , " then preference is on the horizon . Preference implies the existence of plus factors over and above neutrality or acceptance . In other words , people use their senses to determine if a food is edible and secondly if it pleases them . The first is a judgment , the second is a reaction . People prejudge a food by its appearance . From its colour they can tell if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roast of meat will be juicy and succulent , if toasted bread will taste bitter , if coffee is weak . Its odour will tell them if a fish is fresh , if a fat is rancid , if milk is sour . Through previous experience they will frequently be able to predict the flavour and texture of the food from its appearance and aroma , and on the basis of this flash prediction they decide to accept or reject . But the prime test of a food occurs when it is eaten . Its in-the-mouth or flavour properties are by far its most important sensory properties . ' As Sjostrom ( 1959 ) has pointed out , the decision to accept/reject a food item is based on the definition of what is good food , which involves a psychophysical multi-factor evaluation . A few examples of the role of food attributes in this evaluation follow . Color as an Index to Eating Quality. ? ( a ) appropriateness ? The food has no off-color , usually it is uniform in color or has typical variegation , and has no color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is out of the ordinary , e.g. , red French fries , green tinged meat . By convention , inappropriate food colors are blue and psychedelic hues such as electric pink and chartreuse . ( b ) index to process control ? The food is of the appropriate color , reflects light appropriately . A cooked food that is too brown is expected to have a flavor defect ; color indicates overcooking . Juices that are expected to be clear but are turbid reflect overextraction in which the pulp has been extruded into the liquid ; turbidity is expected in " natural " juices . ( c ) index to flavor based on stage of maturity ? This concept applies to fresh fruits and vegetables . IF the skin is green , THEN they are expected to be underripe . IF the skin is brown , THEN they are expected to be overripe or rotten . ( d ) index to purity ? This concept applies to sugar and cereals . IF white , THEN they have been refined or milled to a state of pure carbohydrate . Texture as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The food has no abnormal texture and is uniform with no defects . IF a hard
