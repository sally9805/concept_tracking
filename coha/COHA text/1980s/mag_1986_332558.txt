In defiance of the American television networks , against the wishes of much of the amateur athletic world and without the blessing of the Reagan Administration , Atlanta Yachtsman and Cable TV Impresario Ted Turner has thrown himself a Moscow Olympics complete with flags , anthems and accusations of cheating . To the strains of dueling boycotts , the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had been avoiding each other on the playground for ten years until last week . Opening the Goodwill Games , Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev referred to " the lurking catastrophe " and " the dangerous race toward the abyss " in his cheerful welcome to some 70 nations , not including Israel or 1988 Olympics host-designate South Korea . " They dodged the bullet on Israel , " said Robert Wussler , executive vice president of Turner Broadcasting , " using this excuse , that excuse . They were much more direct on South Korea . They just said no . " With so much goodwill in force , it certainly seemed like the Olympics . <P> The most serene athlete on hand was Soviet Pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ft. 8 3/4 in. into the brief Russian night , the highest anyone has ever flown on a swizzle stick . Immediately , Americans started questioning chemistry . " He 's souped-up , " said Earl Bell , who finished third . Fourth-Place Vaulter Mike Tully allowed , " He 's the best athlete in the world , but he has edges . It all comes down to the doctors : it may be they 've figured a way to get around the drug testing . He 's not a normal athlete ; he 's not a normal person . Maybe the kid just is n't normal . " ( Soviet officials denied that Bubka had taken drugs before competing . ) <P> This became the tenor of the track meet . Sprinter Carl Lewis , the quadruple gold medal man of 1984 , said , " The Russians just cheat . " Reminded that it was a Jamaican from Canada ( Ben Johnson ) who dusted him in the 100  --  for the second time this year , incidentally  --  Lewis reasoned , " They 'll try to help anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned Steve Scott 's silver to bronze , he grumped , " It 's an asinine way to do things , but that 's the Soviet Union . " For welcome counterbalance , Regal Hurdler Edwin Moses extended his nine-year winning streak to 111 races ; Cheryl Miller led the U.S. women 's basketball team to an 83-60 victory over the Soviets ; Dasher Evelyn Ashford , 29 , held off East Germany 's Heike Drechsler , 21 , for another day ; Jackie Joyner became the first U.S. woman since Babe Didrikson Zaharias to hold the world record in a multiple-discipline event . <P> Turner has been saying " The whole idea was to get East and West into the same swimming pool , " and that turned out to be one of the sweetest venues . When New Jersey Freestyler Sean Killion , 18 , beat the great Vladimir Salnikov in a 400-meter race , Killion blinked and said , " I have a picture of him on my wall at home . " Eight years between losses in the 800 or 1,500 , Salnikov announced he would break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest swimmer in history , " said TV Commentator Rowdy Gaines , who enjoyed a golden Olympics two years ago in Los Angeles but still considered 1980 his lost prime .
