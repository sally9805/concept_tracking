Jim and Tammy , Jimmy , Jerry , Oral , Pat . With other evangelistic stars beset by scandal , political controversy or organizational woe , the untainted Billy Graham remains America 's most admired religious leader . And the most durable . " My schedule is just as heavy as when I was 40 , " says Graham , who this week reached 70 . His 1988 itinerary has featured revival meetings , drop-ins at both U.S. political conventions and breakthrough tours in two Communist lands . <P> It was 50 years ago that a rawboned young Billy delivered his first sermon one cold night before 36 Baptists in Bostwick , Fla . Since then , he has preached in person to upwards of 100 million people , more than any other clergyman in history except perhaps Pope John Paul . With recent appearances in Buffalo , Rochester and Hamilton , Ont. , Graham has achieved a remarkable four- decade run of 375 carefully choreographed revival meetings along a civilized sawdust trail . <P> When Graham preaches nowadays , those piercing blue eyes flash from behind bifocals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it takes a half-second longer to uncoil his 6-ft. 2-in. frame when he stands up to preach . But the lilting Carolina voice , firm as ever , still stirs the stadiums . Graham 's simple messages always conclude with words like these : " I 'm going to ask you to get up out of your seat and come forward to say , ' I open my heart to Jesus as Lord and Saviour . ' " To date , say the Graham computers , 2.2 million people have responded . <P> In Graham 's twilight years , the 1950s Red baiter has been targeting the Communist world . Over the past decade , Graham has managed to preach salvation and world peace in Poland , East Germany , Czechoslovakia , Rumania , Hungary and  --  three times  --  the Soviet Union . Last April he conducted his first tour of mainland China , where his wife Ruth was raised by missionary parents . Prior to the arduous three-week visit , he was briefed by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger ; during it , he was the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by new Premier Li Peng . <P> On a 1982 Soviet visit , Graham was lambasted for downplaying religious repression ; he contends he was more effective by raising the problem in private . When the post-glasnost Graham preached last June at Orthodox and Baptist churches in Kiev , the authorities allowed outdoor loudspeakers for the overflow crowds , numbering in the thousands . During the Soviet adventures , he added admiration for the Eastern Orthodox to his longtime friendliness toward Roman Catholics . " I find the Lord 's people among all these groups , " remarks Graham , whose toleration infuriates Fundamentalists . <P> Relaxing at his elegant mountainside log house at Montreat , N.C. , Graham recalled his ten-day Soviet marathon with wonderment : " You could n't believe that human beings could live through it at any age . " How long will this keep up ? In 1989 there will be a London mission , linked by satellite to hundreds of sites in Britain and Africa . Graham is mulling bids from Hong Kong for 1990 , and after that Barcelona , Buenos Aires and Kinshasa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Graham wonders . " To try to hold the attention of a crowd of ten , twenty , thirty thousand people takes a tremendous amount of energy . In the next year I 'll know how much it takes out of me. "
