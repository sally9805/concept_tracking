Hi there , boys and girls ! Just when you thought it was safe to sleep late on Saturday mornings , here comes Pee-wee 's Playhouse , a TV show starring Paul Reubens , a.k.a . Pee-wee Herman . The half-hour program , which will premiere this weekend on CBS , consists of Pee-wee 's tee-hee antics interspersed with animation clips and a cast of oh-so-crazy characters and props , including Chairry , the talking chair , Mr. Window and a mousehole full of dinosaurs . Herman , you see , got complete creative control from the network . " I want the show to be really wacky , " he says , " so when kids are finished watching they will be filled with creative energy . " Oh , wow . Exactly what groggy parents want their children to be filled with on Saturday mornings .
