Republican politicians and consultants said that Mr. Bush needed to solve that problem now , so that this fall he could concentrate on his real foes , the Democrats. // Hours after his Pennsylvania triumph gave him more than the 1 , 139 delegates needed for nomination , Mr. Bush took a conciliatory telephone call from Pat Robertson , the former television evangelist and leader of the religious right . He was Mr. Bush ' s last remaining rival for the nomination , but today Mr. Robertson issued a statement promising his assistance in the fall . <> <> Praise From the Right // Then R. Marc Nuttle , Mr. Robertson ' s campaign manager , went to the office of Mr. Bush ' s campaign manager , Lee Atwater , to be courted for his help in the fall battle . Afterward , Mr. Nuttle praised the Bush campaign as " having done a miraculous job of trying to bring everybody in , " and said he would work in the campaign. // In these efforts Mr. Bush was acting consistent with the advice he received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who told him that to win the Presidency he had to be at peace with the party ' s right wing. // Recalling his losing race for Governor of California in 1962 , Mr. Nixon said that a Republican could afford neither to alienate his conservative base nor to waste time in the fall campaign courting their support . <> <> Goldwater Race Cited // " You can ' t win the election just with these people , as Goldwater proved , " Mr. Nixon was quoted by a friend as telling Mr. Bush . " But you can ' t win the election without these people , as I learned. " // For Mr. Bush , who has long been aware of the merit of Mr. Nixon ' s advice , the meetings today and others like them that have taken place over the last few weeks are among the most important strategic imperatives of his campaign this year : to appease Republican conservatives now , lest they become a troublesome problem in the fall campaign. // October , Republicans say , is the time to reach out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder and worry about the right , it will already be too late . <> <> Criticism From the Right // The other danger , in the view of some on the right , is that between now and the Republican Convention , intense conservatives focus their energies not on the Democratic enemy , Gov . Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts , but on internecine battles for influence in the Republican Party. // " He ' s got to get conservatives off his back on issues like the Vice Presidency and onto the business of going after Dukakis , " said Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia , a thoroughly conservative Congressman whom the Bush campaign has also asked for advice. // On the right wing of the party some figures - for example , Richard Viguerie , the specialist in mail solicitation , and Howard Phillips , president of the Conservative Caucus - have already publicly criticized Mr. Bush , making no secret of their view that a Bush defeat would not be the worst thing that could happen to the Republic or the Republicans. // But criticism from Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp or concern it too much , since the two men have also been deeply critical of President Reagan . More of a danger to Mr. Bush , in the eyes of many Republicans , is the possibility that a conservative insurgency could become more widespread. // Mr. Atwater and other Bush officials say this was unlikely . " To the extent that there is a problem , " Mr. Atwater said , " it ' s a matter of getting everybody involved in the campaign. " // Jim Pinkerton , the Bush campaign ' s director of research , said Mr. Bush continually emphasized issues dear to social conservatives , including his opposition to abortion and his support for school prayer , the death penalty and " a general devotion to family values. " // Mr. Pinkerton said that from the point of view of conservatives , " on most social issues , George Bush is right and Michael Dukakis is 100 percent wrong . " <> <> ' That Took Guts ' // The rumblings on the right are a source of some frustration for the Bush campaign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his political career proving that he really is a conservative . Burt Pines , vice president of the Heritage Foundation , a conservative research organization , noted that Mr. Bush was a leader of Barry Goldwater ' s doomed 1964 campaign in Texas , the home state of Mr. Goldwater ' s opponent , Lyndon B. Johnson . " That took guts , " Mr. Pines said. // In addition , Mr. Atwater encouraged Mr. Bush to make a series of speeches emphasizing right-wing themes as long ago as 1986 . Mr. Atwater ' s stategy was to risk criticism then , in order to placate conservatives well in advance of the election. // But some Republicans , including Mr. Bush ' s sympathizers , say that Mr. Bush ' s problem is as much cultural - his image as what conservatives call a " country club Republican " - as it is issue-specific. // " On issues , the party has become relatively homogeneous , " said Roger Stone , a consultant who worked for the Presidential campaign of Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York . " But culturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s comment goes to the heart of two questions : who " conservatives " are , and why many of Mr. Bush ' s supporters are mystified that anyone who is a conservative would have a problem with the Vice President . <> <> Conservative Creed Supported // Mr. Bush , after all , supports the basic conservative creed . He is a foe of tax increases and a supporter of free-market economics . He is a backs a tough foreign policy and many of the items on the conservative social agenda. // But to many conservatives , Mr. Bush is not , as Mr. Gingrich put it , " one of us , even though he has grown and has changed . " Mr. Bush came late to his opposition to abortion , for example , and was once a sharp critic of supply-side economics ( calling Mr. Reagan ' s proposals " voodoo economics " in a famous phrase ) . Mr. Bush has also had the friendship and support of such Republican party liberals as Representative Jim Leach of Iowa. // There are , as well , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bush will choose as his running mate. // Thomas S. Winter , editor of Human Events , a magazine that is one the best barometers of thinking on the Republican right , said that it would be " a terrible symbol for conservatives and terribly demoralizing " if Mr. Bush chose Governor Kean of New Jersey or Gov . James R. Thompson of Illinois as a running mate . Both are seen by many conservatives as insufficiently committed to their agenda. // Some conservatives also worry about the large role that Secretary of the Treasury James A. Baker 3d is likely to play in the Bush campaign - and in a Bush Administration . " I like Jim Baker and he ' s bright and he has some good ideas , " said Mr. Winter . " But he also has some bad ideas and he ' s much too willing to sell out , to compromise prematurely . " <> <> Conservative Platform Seen // The Bush campaign hopes that one way of assuaging conservatives will be to give them most of what they want in the Republican platform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican platform be an updated version of the 1984 platform , which was largely written by staunch conservatives. // Mr. Bush ' s two liasons to the platform committee , Gov . John H. Sununu of New Hampshire and Charlie Black , a Republican consultant , are both respected by the right. // Mr. Pines and Mr. Pinkerton said the campaign had also reached out for ideas to such conservative strongholds as the Heritage Foundation and the Free Congress Foundation , a major source of thinking for the New Right. // And Mr. Bush has two other factors working in his favor . One is that in the primaries , thanks to his embrace of President Reagan , Mr. Bush won with conservative votes . Mr. Stone , Mr. Kemp ' s adviser , said , " Conservative voters demonstrated what they think of George Bush : They voted for him. " // The other is President Reagan himself . Although the President is less popular on the right than he once was , given his embrace of arms negotiations with the Soviet Union , he is still a powerful symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans argue that Mr. Bush needs to satisfy the concerns of the right not so much to appease their vocal Washington-based leaders as to break through with lower-income white voters . Speaking of the conservative leaders , Kevin Phillips , a leading Republican voting analyst , said , " Their issues , though not their personal influence , reach out and touch a lot of people. " // Low-income whites , in this view , will either vote old Democratic loyalties or not vote at all unless they are motivated by conservative social issues such as crime or abortion . Mr. Phillips warned that such voters would not respond to " centrist blather. " //
