Newly released photographs show just how much the U.S. knew <P> One of the pictures , taken in 1967 over Hanoi by a U.S. reconnaissance plane , freezes a terrifying moment in the Viet Nam War : an exploding SAM missile scoring a kill on a U.S. Phantom reconnaissance jet that has burst into flames . Another shot resembles a sort of hacksaw that turns out , on closer inspection , to be an assortment of bombers at a top-secret airfield in the Soviet Union . There are also high-altitude views of submarines nestling alongside their mother ships on the coast of the Barents Sea ; a lunar-like landscape that is a Soviet hydrogen-bomb test site ; a graceful triangular pattern deep in central Asia that marks the Tyuratam launch site for Soviet space shots and missiles . <P> Except for the Phantom being downed , these remarkable pictures ( all but one never before published ) were shot by U-2 aircraft flying high over the Soviet Union as long as 24 years ago . The glider-like plane was conceived in December 1953 by the brilliant Lockheed Aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson , now 70 , for one purpose : to gather hard data on Soviet military capabilities . Its mission was to soar beyond the range of any jet interceptor or antiaircraft missile and provide the photographic and electronic intelligence necessary for accurate military assessments . <P> " Kelly 's Angel , " as the odd-looking plane was called by its pilots , was up to the task . Flying from bases in Turkey and Pakistan , U-2s crisscrossed the Soviet Union with impunity from 1956 to 1960 . Though the Kremlin was aware of the spy flights , it issued no public protests ; to do so would have amounted to an embarrassing admission that the Soviets could not protect their own airspace . <P> As a result , the U-2 was free to make discoveries that strongly influenced U.S. strategic policy for several years . The 1956 picture of M-4 Bison jet bombers lined up at one airfield showed virtually the entire Soviet production of the craft ; only a few were found at the other fields , ferreted out by the U-2s . That convinced the Pentagon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the overhead view of the Tyuratam site ( where all Soviet missiles were then tested ) gave the U.S. some needed reassurance . Determining that the rocket booster aperture at the base of the launch pad was 15 meters ( 50 ft. ) in diameter , photo interpreters concluded that the Soviets were still using missiles boosted by auxiliary rockets strapped around the circumference of the main rocket . Because they were so cumbersome that they could not be practically deployed , U.S. strategic planners concluded that the missile gap did not exist either . The photograph of the Soviet 's North Sea submarine fleet showed that it was largely a defensive force ; the moored submarines shown here turned out to be Whisky-and Foxtrot-class submarines , designed to attack surface ships rather than to launch nuclear missiles .
