According to TIME 'S cover story this week , eight out of ten Americans will sooner or later suffer from backaches . The rate may be even higher for journalists . They spend long , sedentary hours crouched over typewriters and telephones , wedged immobile in the seats of planes and press buses , and trapped by deadlines that elevate stress levels past the danger point : practically a prescription for back pain . Yet of the TIME editors , writers and correspondents who contributed to this week 's story , only a few confessed to back problems . Medicine Writer Anastasia Toufexis , who wrote the story , and Adrianne Jucius , the reporter-researcher who assisted her , approached the subject with pain-free objectivity . All of those involved , whether they count themselves among the afflicted or not , gained useful insights into the physiology-and the psychology-of aching backs . <P> Joyce Leviton of TIME 'S Atlanta bureau interviewed a physiotherapist who can tell from a person 's posture whether he or she has a back problem . " He looked at the way I sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had bouts of backache , " she says . New York Bureau Chief Peter Stoler , who first injured his back in a mountain climbing accident a decade ago , interviewed numerous doctors , researchers and fellow sufferers . " There is more awareness of the problem today , " says Stoler . " Fewer people are enduring in silence any more . More people are aware of the need to maintain a certain level of physical fitness , especially as they get older . " Linda Stern Rubin of TIME 'S Midwest bureau found Detroit engineers and designers conducting surveys and motion tests to determine ways to make automobile seats more comfortable . The Los Angeles bureau 's Joseph Pilcher visited several " pain clinics , " where such unconventional therapies such as acupuncture and electrical stimulation help patients deal with back pain . <P> Chicago 's Gary Ruderman was told by one neurosurgeon that prolonged periods of squatting would reduce pressure on the spine . Ruderman tried the posture while waiting for a bus , but found the view of passing knees and the stares of passers-by unnerving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who labor not only under stressful deadlines but also under large amounts of equipment . Bill Pierce , whose photos accompany the cover story , is typical . He threw his back out several years ago and now does special exercises regularly to avoid a recurrence . Says he : " If I backslide , it is n't long before a twinge reminds me. "
