Dear Henderson : It has occurred to me that , in my somewhat hasty letter of resignation last week , I may have failed to explain the exact reasons for my drastic action . If this neglect has caused you any worry or distress , I am sorry . And I hasten to assure you that I am not mad at you or at the Earthworm Tractor Company . My only reason for quitting is to give me greater freedom of action , to permit me to operate without being hampered by foolish orders and senseless restrictions from the home office and thus to enable me to do a far better job in promoting the company 's interests . After I complete my operations here in Winnipeg , you will be so impressed by my success that you will undoubtedly want me to resume my position as sales manager . And it is possible , if I am sufficiently urged , that I might accept . Thus it would be much better if you did not hire anyone to take my place . I would not want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager almost immediately after hiring him . As I am now a free man , no longer subject to your orders , I do not need to tell you anything I am doing . However , in view of our long friendship , and because you are undoubtedly interested , I will give you a brief report of my recent activities . You will doubtless remember that about two weeks ago you received news that Mr. George Buttrick , of the Buttrick Mining Company , Winnipeg , Canada , was planning to buy a million dollars ' worth of excavating equipment from the Jumbo Wheel Tractor Company . You promptly directed me to rush up here to Winnipeg and help our dealer get the order shifted to Earthworm . You will also remember that instead of obeying your hasty directive I first visited one of Mr. Buttrick 's mining properties in the state of Maine . And it is well I did so . I picked up a lot of information about Mr. Buttrick 's background . And I made $10,000 on a gravel contract  --  of which I still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , when I finally reached Winnipeg this morning , I arrived amply supplied with both information and funds . I promptly called on our Winnipeg dealer . And I found him sunk in despair . " That million-dollar Buttrick order , " he said , " is blowed up , gone with the wind , down the drain and lost in the deep blue sea ! The biggest order I ever worked on  --  and now it is sunk without a trace . " " Come , come , " I said . " It ca n't be that bad . " " It is , Mr. Botts . This man is the toughest customer I ever ran into . In the first place , he 's a really big operator  --  has made millions in stock-market speculation and financial manipulation . Apparently he avoids taxes by capital-gains setups . And he owns enormous mining properties in both Canada and the United States . But that 's not the worst . " " Go on , " I said . " Mr. Buttrick is not really a mining man at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mining operations . But he has been so successful in financial matters that he thinks he knows everything . He 's obstinate , opinionated , conceited , arrogant -- - " " They told me all that in Maine , " / said . " What I want to know are the latest developments on this million-dollar tractor deal . Just why does Mr. Buttrick need so much equipment ? " " He has recently acquired some big mineral deposits in British Columbia at a place which he has named Buttrick Canyon . " " What kind of minerals ? " " Various rare metals used in the defense industry . I forget what they are called , but that is not important . What matters is that Mr. Buttrick is in a hurry to build an airstrip , so he can fly in supplies and equipment . Later there will be an enormous open-pit mine , and a big mill to concentrate the ore . " " The concentrate will be brought out by plane ? " " Yes . " " Just where is this Buttrick Canyon ? " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " He claims the country is too rough . " The dealer turned to a wall map and put his finger on a dot in northern British Columbia between the Alaska Highway and the Pacific coast . " That 's the place , " he said . " Completely surrounded by mountains and canyons and jagged rocks . " " No roads anywhere near ? " " Just a few mountain trails  --  almost impassable . The only inhabitants are a few Indians and trappers . There 's a rumor that the government is planning a radar station somewhere in the region . But there are no towns , no settlements . The mineral deposits were found by a lone prospector . Mr. Buttrick bought him out and then sent in a party of mining engineers . They have just made their report , and it is so favorable that Mr. Buttrick has decided he is going to go ahead in a really big way . " " In country as rough as that , " I said , " it 's going to be pretty hard to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . " " That 's what I told Mr. Buttrick , but he is too stubborn and opinionated to listen to me . He says there is a flat area several miles square right next to the canyon . All he has to do ? or so he claims  --  is to clear off the trees , and he 'll have a first-class landing field . " " All right , " I said , " if that 's what he wants , we 'll sell him a fleet of our Earthworm tractors , bulldozers and whatever else he needs . He can ship them by railroad to Dawson Creek , run them up the Alaska Highway about as far as the Toad River and then drive them overland the last hundred miles or so to Buttrick Canyon . " " By strange coincidence , Mr. Botts , that 's exactly what I told him myself . " " Good for you , " I said . " I even presented him with a detailed order for Earthworm equipment I thought he would need  --  just over a million dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He told me I was crazy . He said no tractors could possibly get through those mountains . " " Of course , they can , " I said . " I 've never been to Buttrick Canyon , but I know in general what that region is like . I was up there in 1942 when we were building the Alaska Highway . And I know we can get through . " " That 's what I tried to tell him , Mr. Botts , but he said he would n't dream of wasting any of his money on any such off chance  --  especially since the Jumbo Wheel Tractor Company has offered to do the whole job entirely at their own expense . " " Listen , " I said , " those miserably built Jumbo wheel tractors could never get in there in the first place . They 're no good in rough country . They could never get through the mountains . " " They do n't have to get through the mountains , Mr. Botts . The Jumbo people are planning to fly their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how are they going to land ? On a lake ? On a river ? Or will they use helicopters ? " " There are no lakes or rivers nearby , and I understand they ca n't hire enough helicopters . So they 're going to take their tractors and other machines apart , drop them by parachute in small packages and then reassemble them on the ground . " " That 's going to cost a lot of money , " I said . " Just why are the Jumbo people doing it at their own expense ? " " They 're so crazy to get this But-trick order that they have made all kinds of concessions . They even offered a 25 percent discount . But that was n't enough to satisfy Buttrick . He demanded a free demonstration . If Jumbo will build an airstrip at Buttrick Canyon and get it finished ahead of anybody else , he says he will give them the million-dollar order and pay for the airstrip besides . " " Did he make the same offer to you ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airstrip he wants-500 feet wide and a mile long . The trees and the fluff and duff have to be cleared off and the hardpan has to be leveled . If pavement is necessary , he 'll put that in himself later . " " Very generous of him , " I said . " What did you tell him ? " " I told him I simply could not afford , as a dealer , to go to any such expense on the mere chance that I might get his order . " " So the deal is off ? " " Yes . I understand several other tractor companies have turned him down too . The Jumbo dealer is the only one who is going ahead . Apparently the president of the Jumbo company is financing him  --  which is more than the Earthworm president will do for me . " " You have taken this up with Mr. Henderson ? " " Yes . After my interview with Mr. Buttrick 1 sent a wire to Mr. Henderson asking if he would finance this proposition . He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " However , " said the dealer , " you are the sales manager of the company . You have influence with Mr. Henderson . Maybe you could persuade him to help out . " " Not a chance , " I said . " In the first place , I am no longer sales manager . In the second place , I have no influence with Mr. Henderson . And , in the third place , nobody in the world could ever persuade Mr. Henderson to take any such sporting chance as this . " The dealer looked at me in amazement . " You mean to tell me that you are no longer sales manager of the Earthworm Tractor Company ? " " That 's right . I resigned last week . " " Then what are you doing here ? Why are we discussing company affairs ? " " I am now in business for myself , " I said . " I am an expert adviser on tractor problems , a coun you a whole lot more than that . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avaricious man . All I want is the thrill of putting across an exciting deal plus enough money to cover expenses and provide sufficient funds for the next venture . " The dealer looked at me with admiration . " For anyone so generous and unselfish , Mr. Botts , you are incredibly self-confident  --  almost conceited . Here I have completely given up hope on this deal , but you talk as if you are certain you can put it across . What are you planning to do ? Just how are you going to go about this thing ? " " Frankly , I do n't know , " I said . " All I can do is use the same methods I have employed in the past . I will turn this matter over and over in my mind . I will let it soak into my subconscious . I will examine all aspects of the situation . And in time I 'm sure I will come up with a solution . " " It sounds pretty hopeless . " " Not at all , " 1 said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fitted together certain disjointed facts you have given me . I have related these to certain other facts I have learned in my long experience in the tractor business . And already a vague pattern has begun to emerge ? the first faint glimmer of what may turn out to be the dawn of a brilliant idea . And now I would like a copy of that million-dollar order and a copy of Mr. Buttrick 's airstrip specifications . " " Here you are . " He handed them over . " Thank you , " I said . My next move was a visit to the office of the Buttrick Mining Company . Here I learned that Mr. But-trick is in Labrador , so I would have to wait until his return on Monday , May 7 . After learning this disappointing news , I called at the establishment of the Winnipeg dealer of the Jumbo Wheel Tractor Company . Instead of going in the front door , I circled around to the rear and discovered a group of mechanics taking apart a big Jumbo wheel tractor . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation , and was told that this was one of a large fleet of tractors and scrapers that was to be flown piecemeal and dropped by parachute at Buttrick Canyon . The mechanic said it was a rush job . But part of the equipment had not yet arrived from the factory . And there had been a delay in arranging for cargo planes . So the big airlift could not possibly get started until about May 10 . This was indeed good news . While Mr. Buttrick was in Labrador , I would have two weeks to prepare my sales campaign . And after his return I would have three whole days to work on him before the Jumbo people got started . I returned to the hotel to meditate on the situation . For a few minutes I considered calling you , Henderson , by long-distance telephone and asking you to instruct our service department to disassemble , fly to But-trick Canyon and drop by parachute sufficient equipment to build an airstrip ahead of the Jumbo company . If you really got busy on this I knew you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , because I know you dislike emergency long-distance telephone calls , and second , because I realize you are too timid and too conservative to spend the large amount of money this operation would require . Besides , I had by this time dreamed up another more promising idea . I had remembered that an old friend of mine , Col. Angus MacNab , of the Canadian Army Engineers , lives here in Winnipeg . In the old days Angus and I were associated on the Alaska Highway , the Canol Pipe Line and other military and construction projects . More recently he has worked on airport and other construction jobs for the Aircraft Warning Service . But , wherever he is , he always seems to be in charge of a lot of heavy equipment . And he and I have often helped each other out . On various occasions I have lent him a few extra Earthworm tractors . At other times he has returned the favor . And once  --  believe it or not  --  he used one of his large helicopters to pull one of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that good old Angus might be a real help in the present emergency . I called on him . I explained the entire situation . And together we evolved a plan of action that is almost certain to land that million-dollar order for the Earthworm company . This plan is so simple and yet so beautiful that I would like nothing better , Henderson , than to explain the whole thing in this letter . However , the methods we are going to use involve one of the most closely guarded secrets in the entire Canadian Army . This means that I must maintain complete silence . And you , Henderson , must control your curiosity for the next two or three weeks  --  at the end of which time I hope to send you a sensational report of complete success . In the meantime , I wish to remind you of your good fortune in having a sales manager who has the foresight to resign temporarily from his position . It is possible that my operations here might involve the expenditure of several thousand dollars . And , as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am doing , I doubt very much if these expenses would be O.K. 'd by the company comptroller or by you , Henderson . Consequently , if I were still sales manager I would be in serious financial difficulties . Having resigned , however , I can get by very easily . I will make up the deficit by accepting from our dealer the $10,000 commission that I have previously men-tioned , and that I naturally could not accept if I myself were still sales manager . With this happy thought I will close . Most sincerely , ALEXANDER BOTTS EARTHWORM TRACTOR COMPANY EARTHWORM CITY , ILLINOIS OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT Wednesday , April 25 , 1956 Dear Botts : Your letter is here . And , for once , I agree with much that you have to say . Neither the company comptroller nor I would even consider passing an expense account from you or anybody else when it involves the outlay of thousands of dollars for activities claimed to be so secret that they could not even be described . You are also right in assuming I would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of equipment into the wilds of Canada on the mere chance that we might thereby make a sale . Your glib talk about military secrecy does not sound to me like a legitimate attempt to keep valuable information from an enemy power . It seems more like something you dreamed up to hide embarrassing facts . I can well believe that your friend , Col. Angus MacNab , may have succeeded in pulling a tractor out of a mudhole with a helicopter . But it would take more than Colonel MacNab and a whole fleet of helicopters  --  if that is what you have in mind  --  to fly in enough equipment to build an airstrip a mile long in any reasonable length of time . Also , it would cost more money than the $6,000 you say you have on hand plus $10,000 you expect to receive from our dealer . However , it 's your misfortune and none of my own . In closing I feel it is my duty to tell you that we can not hold the position of sales manager open for an indeterminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are therefore accepting your resignation . Most sincerely , GILBERT HENDERSON , President , Earthworm Tractor Company Winnipeg Hotel , Winnipeg , Canada , Monday , May 7 , 1956 Dear Henderson : Your letter arrived in Winnipeg over a week ago , but I have been too busy to answer it until this evening . Now , however , I have plenty of time . My activities in the matter of Mr. Buttrick 's million-dollar order have progressed to the point where I am on the very brink of success . In the two weeks since my previous letter , I have been working hard with good old Angus Mac-Nab . He has co-operated 100 percent . And yesterday we completed all of the preliminary work for one of the most stupendous sales operations of my entire career . This morning Mr. But- trick got back from Labrador . This afternoon I called on him . And I am happy to report that I was able to hand him a sales talk so sensational and so effective that I will now quote it in full , so that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an authentic example of how a real salesman handles a big deal . Realizing that Mr. Buttrick is a self-important stuffed shirt who is too impatient to listen to a logical and reasonable presentation , I decided to make my remarks so apparently outrageous that he would be tricked into listening and answering back . In order to make my entrance as dramatic and interesting as possible , I ignored the usual formalities . Pushing past the receptionist , I burst into Mr. Buttrick 's private office completely unannounced . And I started talking at once . I said , You want an airstrip at Buttrick Canyon . You are in a hurry . All right , if you will give me the job , I will have the whole thing completed , according to your own specifications , in exactly three days . Think of it  --  only three days ! " This approach , I am happy to report , was successful . Mr. But-trick 's interest  --  as well as his anger  --  was immediately aroused . continued on page 84 Biggest Deal continued from page 51 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pounded his fist on the desk . Then he started yelling , " You 're crazy ! You do n't know what you 're talking about ! Who are you anyway ? Who let you in ? " " Calm yourself , " I said suavely . " I am not crazy . I know what I am talking about . My name is Alexander Botts . Nobody let me in , I just came . Formerly , I was sales manager of the Earthworm Tractor Company . At present I represent the local Earthworm dealer . He tells me you offered to buy approximately a million dollars ' worth of Earthworm equipment , according to this sales order , provided we could construct an airstrip according to these specifications , ahead of anybody else . " I laid the order and the specifications on his desk . " Is that correct ? " I asked . " I made the offer . But you people turned it down two weeks ago . In the meantime the Jumbo dealer is going ahead . He plans to start flying his equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish the airstrip this fall . " " You can forget about having to wait till fall , " I said . " All you have to do is give us the word , and we can have the whole job finished by next Thursday  --  three days from now  --  before the Jumbo people even get started . " By this time Mr. Buttrick had calmed down somewhat . But he was still interested enough to argue . " As I told you before , " he said , " you are crazy . " " Not at all , " I said . " With old-fashioned methods it would take weeks or months to complete this job . But we are using some very special construction techniques that have been developed by the Earthworm Tractor Company in co-operation with the Canadian Army . " " And just what are these tech-niques ? " " I am sorry , Mr. Buttrick , I can not tell you . " " Why not ? " " It 's a military secret . " " But the whole thing is impossible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mr. Buttrick , " I said , " has it never occurred to you that we live in an age of miracles ? " " Maybe so , but --  --  " " And do you not realize that many of these miracles  --  like the atom bomb  --  have been developed in secret ? " " You mean that you have a fleet of secret machines of some kind that you can transport to a remote section of British Columbia to build an airstrip  --  all in three days ? " " Buttrick . I can not divulge any of our actual methods . However , I can suggest certain ideas which may possibly make it easier for you to believe my seemingly incredible claims . Have you ever stopped to think that an airfield is one of the first things needed by an invading army when it lands on a foreign shore ? " Mr. Buttrick looked puzzled . " I suppose so , " he said . " And how have such airfields been built in the past ? " " Mostly by bulldozers , I suppose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds of heavy machinery have been needed . And it has been necessary to land this equipment  --  often with great difficulty and considerable delay  --  throughpounding surf , on rocky shores and often many miles from the terrain suitable for a landing field . " " Probably that 's true . " " Of course it 's true , " I said . " And , if you think it over , you will readily understand that any progressive military establishment like the Canadian Army would try to develop better and faster methods . " " Such as what ? " " Use your imagination , " I said . " Earth-moving machinery does not have to be heavy . It does not have to crawl slowly along the ground . Have you never heard about rockets ? Or jet propulsion ? " " Yes , Mr. Botts . " " If you want to clear away a forest , Mr. Buttrick , you do n't necessarily have to chop down the trees with old-fashioned axes . You do n't even have to use chain saws or push the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are such things as shaped charges and other types of modern explosives . And it is even conceivable that we might use an atomic flame thrower . " " And you mean to tell me , Mr. Botts , that you have on hand such machines and devices ? " " Certainly not , Mr. But-trick . The methods we use are entirely different  --  and completely secret . I have mentioned these other things merely to broaden your outlook and to indicate to you that the field of military engineering is not limited by the conventional techniques of former years . " " Listen , Mr. Botts , " he said . " I am a busy man . I have no time to listen to all this fantastic chatter . It just happens that I am going to fly my private plane to Buttrick Canyon next Thursday . Naturally I am not planning to land . I merely want to look the place over from the air and watch the parachute operation that the Jumbo Wheel Tractor Company is planning for that day . " " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " I would suggest therefore that you notify the Jumbo people so that they may be spared the expense of this useless expedition . " " Ha ! " said Mr. Buttrick . " I will do exactly that .

THE EARTHWORM COMPANY HAS NEVER CO-OPERATED WITH THE CANADIAN ARMY IN DEVELOPING ANY SUCH SECRET MACHINERY AS YOU INDICATE . IT IS THE UNANIMOUS OPINION OF OUR ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT THAT THERE IS NO EQUIPMENT IN EXISTENCE WHICH COULD BE MOVED INTO AN UNINHABITED WILDERNESS AND BUILD A MILE-LONG AIRSTRIP  --  ALL IN THREE DAYS , IT IS ONLY FAIR TO TELL YOU I AM HIGHLY SKEPTICAL . GILBERT HENDERSON Winnipeg Hotel Winnipeg , Canada Saturday , May 12 , 1956 Dear Henderson : No wonder you are skeptical . You have read my reports so carelessly that you have missed a number of important points . And you have jumped to a lot of unwarranted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will see that I never said the Earthworm Tractor Company had co-operated with the Canadian Army in developing secret machinery . I merely said that the company ( represented by myself , even though I have been on temporary leave ) was co-operating with the Canadian Army on construction methods . And this is perfectly true . Col. Angus MacNab and I have been co-operating on secret methods , not machinery . Furthermore , I never said I would construct a mile-long airstrip in three days , I merely said I would have it finished in three days  --  which is something entirely different . Your lack of understanding , Henderson , is of course partly due to the fact that I was compelled , for reasons of military secrecy , to withhold a few of the more important facts . Now , however , my friend Angus has informed me that the situation has changed sufficiently so that I may reveal what has heretofore been top secret . I will therefore explain exactly what I have been doing , and I will do so as nearly as possible in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henderson , may be able to understand what has been going on . I want you to notice that if you had read my previous reports a little more carefully , you could have guessed at a great many of the conclusions which I was unable to explain fully . In my first letter I reported that our dealer had casually mentioned a rumor about a radar station near Buttrick Canyon . I also told you that Col. Angus MacNab , who had formerly been in charge of Earthworm tractors and other heavy equipment on such projects as the Alaska Highway , has recently been doing some sort of work in the Aircraft Warning Service . Putting all these facts together , I decided  --  before I even talked to Angus  --  that he was probably in charge of building radar stations  --  including the one near Buttrick Canyon . If so , he might have some heavy equipment in the neighborhood . I lost no time , therefore , in calling on Angus . And I was delighted to find that the situation was even better than I had hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radar stations , he had actually been working for over a month on the station near Buttrick Canyon . It seems the job is semisecret . It is apparently impossible to conceal a radar station completely , but the government prefers to keep these installations as inconspicuous as possible . Rumors get around , but the general public knows very little about what is going on . Angus told me that he had spent the preceding month with a fleet of twenty-four Earthworm tractors and auxiliary equipment in building a tractor trail  --  as narrow and as inconspicuous as possible  --  from the Alaska Highway to the site of the radar station . All of this equipment was still on hand only ten miles from Buttrick Canyon . This was one of those lucky breaks which you , Henderson , like to refer to as " purely accidental " or " mere luck . " However , I would like to point out that this kind of luck occurs only to people like me who go after it . Our Winnipeg dealer had heard the rumor about the radar station . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various construction projects and knew of his recent connection with the Aircraft Warning Service . But he never did anything about it . I gave you all the facts , Henderson , two weeks ago . And you never did anything . You continued on page 94 Biggest Deal continued from page 89 never even thought of doing anything . But I am a man of action . And I am proud to report that I have finished up this project as brilliantly and efficiently as I started it . It was not easy . First I had to convince Angus  --  by a great flood of inspirational oratory  --  that Mr. But-trick 's mining operations are of such vital importance to the defense industry in both the United States and Canada that it was his patriotic duty to use his big fleet of tractors to build the airstrip at Buttrick Canyon . Then I had to persuade him to do the job right ery available , the construction work was pure routine . We scraped off the scrubby growth of spruce , jack pine and aspen , including the fluff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardpan so that we had a reasonably good landing field of the kind called for in Mr. But-trick 's specifications . The whole job was finished in about ten days . When I got back to Winnipeg , however , I had the problem of persuading Mr. Buttrick , who had just returned from Labrador , to reinstate the offer that our dealer had turned down . Mr. Buttrick was already much impressed by the Jum bo offer to sell him what they claim is a million dollars ' worth of machinery for only $750,000 . My only chance to argue him into spending a full million for Earthworm was to promise him a hurry-up job on his airstrip . But I could not tell him the airstrip was already finished . Even you , Henderson , will admit that I could not successfully bargain with a tough customer by offering him something he already had . Furthermore , I could not tell him how the job was done ; that was a military secret . That is why I had to give him the highly imaginative sales talk that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to get him to renew his offer . And away , without waiting for permission from his superior  --  a rather unreasonable general who was taking a trip somewhere in the South Pacific . " You can do the job first , " I said , " and ask permission afterward . You do n't have to tell him about this yourself . And you can keep the news from leaking out and reaching him indirectly by declaring the whole operation top secret  --  which will be entirely in accordance with established military tradition . " " How so ? " " Military secrecy , " I said , " is sometimes used to conceal vital facts from the enemy . But it is employed even more often to hide embarrassing facts from superior officers , from investigating committees and even from the general public . " Angus hesitated . But finally he agreed to go ahead  --  keeping the whole operation secret . So you were completely right , Henderson , when you suggested in your recent letter that my talk about military secrecy was something I dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fairly easy . Angus sent out advance orders by radio , and we both arrived on the scene the following day , after a rush trip by plane and jeep . With all that machin this afternoon , when he returned from a hasty inspection trip to Buttrick Canyon , I think he actually believed I had done the whole job in three days . Anyway , he signed the million-dollar order . He paid the airstrip construction costs  --  which I am turning over to Angus . And he notified the unfortunate Jumbo people that they were out in the cold . If he finds out later that we did the job ahead of time , it will do no harm . Just before I started to write this report , my friend Angus telephoned that his commanding officer had returned in such an unexpectedly affable mood that he had taken a big chance and told him the entire story of our little project in British Columbia . The general promptly gave his ex-postfacto approval , so the job is no longer top secret and I am therefore free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastically paid me the $10,000 commission , so I am accepting your offer and returning to my old job as sales manager  --  this time with a very satisfactory little nest egg to use in case I should decide at some future time that I would be able to best further the interests of the company by re-resigning . Cordially yours , ALEXANDER BOTTS. 411 !
