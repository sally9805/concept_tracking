Suddenly , New England has an auto racing tycoon . Mr. Good Guy , Dick Williams , made it official last week : He has added Thompson Speedway , the region ' s largest oval track , to his string that already includes Westboro and Monadnock . Williams also said he had hoped to announce the signing of another track but couldn ' t " at the time " because negotiations aren ' t complete . He refused to say what track would be the fourth but it is understood to be New London- Waterford in Connecticut . The four tracks under a single direction is not unique for New England . Bill Welch and John Falconi did much the same a score of years ago . " John has told me it isn ' t much more difficult to run several tracks at once than a single one , " said Williams . " He ' s been right in about everything else he has told me . I ' ll soon see if he is right about this one . It makes sense , though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making auto racing attractive for fans and participants . The nuts and bolts of running races has to be delegated to others . " Williams , who calls his operation Coastal Racing Assn. , announced at the same time that Busch Beer is becoming a major sponsor of his racing , contributing " in the neighborhood of $25,000 with the promise of more next year if we do a good job . " He said he had hoped for a bigger bit from Busch but " even with that we are able to up the purse for the Thompson 300 from $53,000 to $70,000 making it the highest paying modified race anywhere . " The announcements were made at a Thompson Clubhouse press conference during which the owner of the track , Donald Hoenig , was conspicuous by his absence though he was reportedly available in the area . Williams said Hoenig had leased him the track for three years and he will have everything but the food concessions . " Donald is one heckuva golfer who is now 50 and wants to join the senior men ' s PGA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . Donald is going to continue to make improvements to the track and adding grandstands . I would love to have a NASCAR Grand National race here in 1982 . " He said that there will be no attempt to coerce drivers who run at one track to run at another by having combined point funds and the like . " I don ' t want guys running 200 miles from Monadnock to a track they shouldn ' t be going to just to chase points . " The Williams addition of Thompson was applauded by Dick Armstrong , president of the N.E. Drivers and Owners Club ( NEDOC ) . Williams led a boycott of Thompson last season , an action that resulted in the track being closed for several weeks . Williams says he will retain Bill Slater as chief steward at Thompson and Dick Brooks as starter . Also retained as promotion director is Ben Dodge , Jr . He is making some changes on format such as dropping supermodifieds from the opening event , the March 29 " Icebreaker . " " The Icebreaker will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modifieds with a $20,000 purse , 30 laps for late models and 20 laps for the streets . There were only 22 supers available so early in the season last year and with 60 mods in the pits more money is needed for that purse . " Thompson will run Sundays as it has in the past . Monadnock , in Southwestern New Hampshire , has been moved to Friday night and Westboro , a highly successful operation under Williams last year , will continue on Saturday nights . New London-Waterford is also a Saturday night operation and would be the only Williams conflict . Williams got his first experience in track operation three years ago when he took over the direction of New London-Waterford that was in danger of not opening that year . " It ' s just down the street from my construction business , and I hated to see my home track fail , " he said . After Williams made a success of the track the original management moved back in . Now Williams is supposedly on the brink of returning . He drove a race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an owner . Bill drove a Williams car to a championship at the old Norwood Arena . Why do people keep turning tracks over to Williams to run and why has he been successful where others couldn ' t hack it ? Williams isn ' t the greatest speaker in the world so he concentrates on listening . He has the knack of knowing what auto racing fans want and has a tremendous camaraderie with the drivers whose situation he knows intimately . And he has a conviction that auto racing is New England ' s most popular spectator sport and has been able to get promotion-minded sponsors like Busch to agree with him .
