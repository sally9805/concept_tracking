A new book casts dim light on the life of John Belushi <P> By the time that John Belushi finally bought it , in the winter of 1982 , he had already made a considerable and enthusiastic investment in his own destruction . He had also bought , whole , every sorry , second-rate dream of success that American pop culture has to offer : the performer as outlaw , the outlaw as sha man ; self-immolation as the fulfillment of a creative spirit that burns too hot to contain or understand ; drugs as recreation , revelation and social challenge , a turn-on for talent , a tip sheet for personal apocalypse . He died , really , of the cumulative effects not only of the cocaine and heroin that had swollen his brain and bloated his heart but of all these bad dreams . <P> From the time he got his first taste of success in the early ' 70s , performing in Chicago with the improvisational troupe Second City , Belushi 's life was an increasingly frenetic series of binges , punctuated by bouts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and no help for him . <P> That is the way his life reads , anyhow , in Bob Woodward 's mildly sensational , ultimately senseless account , Wired : The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi ( Simon and Schuster , $17.95 ) . The book , kicked off with a front-page serialization launch and favorable review in the Washington Post , where Au thor Woodward heads up the investigative reporting staff , is drawing the kind of hoopla usually kindled by more conventional show-biz behemoths ; an excerpt has also appeared in Playboy . Like some Hollywood superproduction , the book boasts a long list of cameo appearances by stars ( Jack Nicholson , Robin Williams , Robert De Niro , Carrie Fisher and miscellaneous The Rolling Stones ) whose presence has nothing of importance to contribute save what agents and producers like to call " name value . " <P> Indeed , the entire book is basically an exercise in casting : get the country 's star investigative reporter to tackle " the unanswered questions " about the grubby death of America 's favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the President 's Men and The Final Days was on the case invested Belushi 's life with a weight and dimension it lacked when he was busy living it . It turns out , however , that there are no unanswered questions that matter . So everyone comes up short : Belushi 's widow and his sister-in-law , who first enlisted Woodward in the project ; the author himself , who does a considerable amount of vamping and page filling by re-creating old Belushi routines from Saturday Night Live ; and any reader who hopes to learn some lesson from Belushi 's death or is even curious to know why it matters .
