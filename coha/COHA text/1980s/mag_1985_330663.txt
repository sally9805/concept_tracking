Shortly after dawn late last week , the ramrod-stiff figure of General Fabian Ver , the armed forces Chief of Staff , arrived at a govern ment office building in downtown Manila to surrender himself . Two days earlier the Tanodbayan  --  a four-member panel of ombudsmen  --  had indicted Ver , 24 other members of the military and one civil ian for their alleged involvement in the 1983 murders of Opposition Leader Benigno ( " Ninoy " ) Aquino Jr . and of Rolando Galman , the man said by the military to have killed Aquino . Ver brought $1,600 to post as bail , then left before any photographers showed up . Ver , a cousin of President Ferdinand Marcos , was once considered the second most powerful man in the Philippines . Now his authority has been seriously weakened . With Ver 's indictment , the Tanodbayan supported the findings of last fall 's majority report of the Agrava board , which had been appointed by the government to investigate the deaths of Aquino and Galman . Four of the five members of the commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same 26 men who were indicted last week . Ver and the officer he assigned to investigate the killing , Major General Prospero Olivas , were among eight men named by the Tanodbayan as accessories for their part in concealing evidence of the crime . <P> The panel 's findings , particularly in regard to Ver , resulted largely from his testimony to the Agrava board last April . According to the Tanodbayan report , that testimony was found " to be of doubtful veracity or at times . . . false . " In addition to those named as accessories , 17 soldiers , including Aquino 's military escorts and Brigadier General Luther Custodio , who was responsible for security at Manila airport , were charged as principals in the conspiracy and ordered held without bail . Herminio Gosuico , a Manila businessman , was named as an accomplice . Said Agapito ( " Butz " ) Aquino , 45 , younger brother of the slain opposition leader : " What is lacking is the mastermind . " <P> The indictments were not unexpected ; if the panel had decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would likely have been a national outcry . Conviction , however , is another matter . The accused will be arraigned this week and their joint trial may begin shortly thereafter . As many as 26 lawyers are expected to cross-examine witnesses before the three judges of the Sandiganbayan . " This is just a preview to a whitewash , " said a Manila businessman after the indictments . Aquilino Pimentel , leader of the Democratic Party , has called Ver 's indictment a ploy " to get acquitted and prevent any further charges against him . " Said a member of Marcos ' Cabinet : " If Ver ever gets reinstated , it will only be for two weeks , and it will only be to save face . So after that , he will be retired . " <P> In the meantime the anti-Marcos forces received a boost last week when another exiled opposition leader , former Senator Jovito Salonga , 62 , returned from a four-year stay in the U.S. The government had taken some of the drama from his arrival , first by dropping the subversion charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then by inviting Salonga 's family to participate with the military and other civilians in enforcing tight security precautions at the airport . Said General Hermilo Ahorro , deputy police chief : " It all went very smoothly this time . "
