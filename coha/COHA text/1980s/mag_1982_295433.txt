And still no Rx for the MX <P> It was worrisome enough when President Reagan described the U.S. nuclear arsenal as unequivocally inferior to the Soviet Union 's . Last week , during a dinner with reporters , Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger went his boss one better with some nuclear scare talk that was even more worrisome . " Soviet missiles , " Weinberger declared flatly , " are now more accurate than ours . " <P> Weinberger 's revelation was amended by a spokesman , Henry Catto . " Some of the Soviet missiles are more accurate , " he ventured , " and some are not . " Nevertheless , even if Weinberger were only half right , it would mean that the Soviet advantage in overall nuclear megatonnage was no longer counterbalanced by the superior guidance systems of U.S. warheads . <P> In the opinion of many strategic analysts , however , Weinberger was at least hyperbolic . They maintain that only the most advanced Soviet missiles approach the targeting precision of the 550 U.S. Minuteman IIIs . <P> Of greater concern is the uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land-based nuclear missiles . The Ford and Carter Administrations had planned to shuttle 200 MXs among thousands of shelters over a vast tract of Western desert . Reagan scrapped the scheme , proposing to store the first 36 missiles temporarily in existing silos . Congress rejected that idea . Now congressional impatience has hardened to outrage . Last month the Republican-controlled Senate Armed Services Committee refused to appropriate funds for the initial allotment of nine missiles ( at $160 million each ) until a permanent decision is made on deployment . <P> The latest leading contender among basing schemes is " Dense Pack . " The idea is to build , say , 200 underground silos on several 20-sq. - mi. parcels of military land . Since only 20 missiles would be allotted to each 200-silo cluster , scores of empty silos would harmlessly draw Soviet warheads . One of Dense Pack 's entirely theoretical virtues is " fratricide " : since Soviet bombs would arrive in exceptionally tight formation , the first to explode might destroy its " brother " warheads . <P> The other options under study are even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3,000 ft. down inside mountains ; the " Big Bird " scheme calls for a fleet of mammoth airborne MX launchers . With the more far-fetched " Orbital Basing , " MX warheads would be put into orbit only after a Soviet missile launching , and the U.S. warheads could then be directed at Soviet targets at the Government 's discretion . The extra time to make momentous decisions would be valuable ; the delay in deciding where to put the missiles is not .
