New bankruptcy law helps debtors survive financial woes <P> James and Lynda Hobson , a Salt Lake City couple in their early thirties , owed creditors more than $18,000 in secured and unsecured debts* when they appeared in court last month-a considerable burden for a family with an annual income of only $15,000 and a fourth child on the way . An $8,000 loss on a house they had built-and then had to sell before ever moving in-was one reason they were in trouble ; another was the $1,200 that they had accumulated in medical bills . Hard pressed for cash , the couple had begun to rely heavily on credit cards late in 1978 . " We 'd borrow from Diners Club to meet the utility payments and from Visa to pay for groceries , " recalls Lynda . Eventually , that house of cards collapsed . Buried under bills and harassed by creditors , the Hobsons turned to an attorney , who sought shelter for them under the recently overhauled federal Bankruptcy Act . The Hobsons paid a $60 filing fee , and soon afterward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on every dollar owed to unsecured creditors as part of $150-a-month payments that also cover the secured creditors . Under the plan 's terms , the couple will still be able to afford a $140 monthly tithe to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints . <P> The Hobsons ' financial woes typify the debt crises facing the increasing number of Americans who end up in bankruptcy court . These days , family finances are stretched so tight that a change in circumstance-loss of job , divorce , birth of a child-can be disastrous . With Americans overdosing on credit and the economy threatening to nosedive , a surging personal bankruptcy rate may well eclipse the record of 224,354 cases set during the recession year of 1975 . <P> Throughout this century , the federal <P> Bankruptcy Act of 1898 was the final resort for the debt ridden . Before the revised act went into effect last October , the typical debtor went into " straight bankruptcy " : many of his possessions were taken from him and sold . Secured creditors , attorneys ' fees , court costs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unsecured creditors on a pro rata basis . Many of the creditors remained unpaid , while the debtor had little left with which to start a recovery . Only in about 15% of the cases did debtors choose to proceed under Chapter 13 , or the " wage-earners ' plan , " which permitted partial repayment of debts over three years and sometimes longer , but subject to the creditors ' veto . <P> Much of that changed when the new law , before Congress for five years , came into effect . Most important among its provisions was a liberalization of Chapter 13 - on the theory that easing the debtor 's hardship would give him or her the financial strength to pay a reasonable percentage of what was owed .
