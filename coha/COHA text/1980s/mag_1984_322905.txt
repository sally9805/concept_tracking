Bonner exiled , Sakharov taped <P> Increasingly angered by the dissident activities of Andrei Sakharov over the past two decades , Soviet authorities last week moved to exact another bit of vengeance . A court reportedly sentenced Sakharov 's wife Yelena Bonner , 61 , to five years of internal exile for anti-Soviet slander .
