Cape Cod is an arm flexing into the Atlantic , an ambiguous gesture : America summoning Europe , showing its muscle , or giving the Italian equivalent of the finger . In 1849 and in 1857 , Henry David Thoreau walked from Eastham to Provincetown , a distance of about twenty-eight miles . Since then the dunes have n't changed much , but Provincetown has been transformed from a fishing village into a capital of honky-tonk . So walking from Eastham to Provincetown , which I do each summer , is like hiking through time , from 1849 to the present , from a landscape that is not too different from what Thoreau saw to one that is very different . And comparing Thorcau 's Cape with the Cape today is a means of measuring some of the ways in which our country has changed in the past century and a third . Or so I , at first , thought . On reaching Boston ... we noticed in the streets a handbill headed " Death1 one hundred and forty-five lives lost at Cohasset . " ... The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with emigrants , was wrecked on Sunday morning .... The first time I walked up the Cape , in the summer of 1974 , when I was twenty-nine , the body of a woman had just been found in a secluded spot in the dunes near Provincetown . She had been sexually assaulted , and her hands had been chopped off . At the time , it had seemed a neat , if melodramatic counterpart to the shipwreck that had greeted Thoreau on his first walk up the Cape . Thoreau 's egoism ? the selfishness that led him to seek at Walden Pond a life in which any dealing with others could be on his terms ? had found in the wreck an excuse to turn life into a pageant staged for his benefit .

" One hundred and forty-five dead , and Thoreau sympathized with the forces that killed them . It is unpopular to suggest that Thoreau 's self-reliance ? which in our time has been reinterpreted to mean self-service ? might be rooted in narcissism , the theatrical pride of a spoiled kid who retreats to his bedroom , slamming the door to keep out the adults . But throughout his book Cape Cod , Thoreau makes himself the measure of what he hears and sees ? which is , of course , exactly what any author must do . Literature is full of the sound of slamming doors . The 1974 dune murder was so barbarous that it stirred elemental fears . People in bars were sure the killing had been part of a satanic ritual . A garage mechanic claimed he 'd heard that the body had been drained of blood ; the killing was an act of vampirism , although he took comfort in his conviction that the vampire was n't a supernatural creature . It was merely a man with a taste for blood . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me at the counter said he was sure the murder had been done by hippies ? this was 1974 , remember , not long after the height of what was then called the counterculture . He 'd just seen a science fiction movie about the end of the world . Reveling in the apocalypse , people went crazy , he told me ; had sex in the streets , broke windows , trampled one another . It was the same up there in Provincetown , he said . They ? he jabbed his thumb over his shoulder as though they followed him around , a ghost chorus ? lived as if the world were about to end . That 's how they could do such ghastly things . The crime became a promiscuous symbol , representing whatever evils an outraged citizen felt threatened by . The breakdown of the family . after Labor Day . 1 arrived on the beach near Eastham at dawn , about two hours before high tide . The wind was blowing from the southeast . There was a drizzle pockmarking the sand . The sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horizon , so looking at the ocean was like staring at the inside of an egg , which ? as the mist lifted ? seemed to be cracking along its middle as though the world were about to hatch . The Nauset Light , on the cliff to my left , was a squat tower , like a chess rook : white on the bottom , red on the top . Its searchlight , pale yellow , getting paler as the sky brightened , turned off as I passed below on the beach . The three lighthouses Thoreau had seen were destroyed in 1892 , the same year Lizzie Borden was accused of her crime . Two surf-casters were walking hack and forth along the shore , checking their rods , which they 'd stuck upright in metal tubes jammed into the sand . They were serious fishermen , one in an orange windbreaker , the other in a blue-hooded sweatshirt , who except for their costumes could have been on the beach when Thoreau walked up the Cape . As 1 passed , the three of us nodded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was far enough along the shore so that they were out of sight , I sat in the shelter of the high cliff that ran along the length of the beach all the way to Provincetown . I unpacked a thermos of coffee and a doughnut from the rucksack I was carrying ( Thoreau had walked with an umbrella ) and had breakfast . The surf sounded like a stereo demonstration record : soft off tomy right , getting louder as the breakers rolled along the beach , cracking like a gunshot right in front of me , and getting softer as they rolled farther along the beach to my left . The waves , as they slid up the sand , foamed and hissed like butter sizzling in a frying pan . The noise the surf made would have been the same 135 years ago , but Thoreau would have heard it differently . It is not just that I use a simile he would not have used , but that because I live in a time in which stereos exist , I actually hear the noise of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but clues to how our minds interpret the world . Sitting there , I had my first suspicion that my thesis about walking forward through time might be arbitrary . I could just as easily have been walking backward through time ? from a landscape very different from the one Thoreau had seen to a town that , for all its modern honky-tonk , was closer to the village he 'd visited than I had at first assumed . Because it was harder to get to , the beach seemed far more savage to Thoreau than it did to me . For him , it was " a wild , rank place " with " no flattery in it . " For me , it was a park , protected by the federal government , subject to regulations , planted with Erosion Control Area signs . For Thoreau , Provincetown was " a flourishing town " that looked forward to a prosperous future . For me , it was a city that looked backward to its past . Its history was the central fact of its life , the thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town 's notoriety as a sinkhole of vice , Provincetown had a bad reputation as far back as 1727 . The Devil , according to Mary Heaton Vorse , chased a ship 's captain named Jeremiah Snaggs all over the Cape , from Barnstable to Orleans to Wellfleet , finally catching him in Provincetown . " Welt , " said Captain Jeremiah , " you caught me fair and squar ' . Whar do we go from here ? " " Go ? " said the devil . " Nowhar . Ai n't we to Ptovincetown ? " When I started walking again , the last of the mist was rolling in big balls off the cliffs and spreading along the beach . The sun broke through . A man in a red plaid shirt and chinos , another beach hiker , appeared up the shore about 200 feet ahead of me , his long-legged shadow stretched out on the sand . I was to see him off and on all day . By the time 1 reached Marconi Beach , the sun was out for good . Where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luster like the sheen of a dead fish . Styrofoam egg cartons , plastic six-pack holders , and empty bleach bottles washed up with the waves . The debris Thoreau found , the remains of wrecked ships and their cargo , seemed more heroic ? ships breaking up in stonns instead of bathers tossing beer cans into the surf . But , of course , littering does n't lead to loss of life ; shipwrecks do . At various secluded spots , the garbage had been turned into art . In one place , driftwood , colored cloth , crab shells , plastic containers , and yellow rope had been used to build the skeleton of a boat . At another spot garbage had been organized into an antic house , something out of an Edward Lear poem , flying half-deflated balloons and raggedy pennants made of old T-shirts . There Is usually , as I have said , no bathing on the backside of the Cape , on account of the undertow .... On Marconi Beach , three white lifeguard towers stood empty , facing the sea . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour before high tide , and there were no bathers in sight , although farther along the shore I found an elderly man dressed in white slacks , aes , a few late-season bathers were sitting on towels , waiting to get warm enough to dash into the water ; and some scavengers were wandering along the shore , looking not for firewood or valuable cargo from shipwrecks ( like the scavengers Thoreau met ) , but for shells and stones and pieces of smooth colored glass . I 'd been filling my pockets with souvenirs , too : rocks shaped as perfectly as eggs , clam shells , ark shells , periwinkles , and translucent gray stones that looked like solidified smoke . A few hundred feet from the crowded part of the beach , naked bathers lay , working on tans . The adults were nude , and the kids were clothed . In 1954 , before I 'd ever heard of Tho- reau , my family visited one of my father 's cmnies ? let 's call him Ernst Weibeck ? who had a summer place in Wellfleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened onto a strip of sand . Beyond , framed by the door 's arch , the ocean gleamed like black plastic . There were a few other families down for the day . It was mid-May , so no one had thought to bring a bathing suit ; but it was unseasonably warm , so the younger kids had stripped and were playing at the water 's edge , naked . " Go on in , " my father told me . I 'd just turned nine and was too old , I thought , to swim naked . tvly father kept goading me , and I kept refusing ? much to the amusement of the other adults . " It 's too babyish , " I said . " Balls , " said Weibeck , who in Germany in the early 1930s had been a member of the Verband Volksgesundheit , a socialist nudist organization . In the middle of the living room , he stripped ; and he ran through the double doors down to the water ? followed by the other men , who also stripped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as figures in a late Picasso print . As I passed a nude woman , stretched out on her back , she opened her eyes , started ? as a token of modesty ? to raise one knee so she would n't be caught spread-eagled , then resisted the impulse , staying defiantly as she was . I like nudity , but I 've never been able ? as friends of mine claim they have ? to find it innocent , When I used to camp on these dunes with the couples with whom my wife and I were sharing a house , I was never able to pretend that skinny-dipping was an act of liberation ? which meant I found it hard to counterfeit a disinterested gaze at the bodies of the women as they proved how free they were by wandering around the campsite naked . I 'm sure it is a character flaw , But my response to seeing an attractive woman undressed is nearly always lewd . Even in a museum , when I come upon a nude ? whether it is an obviously pornographic Boucher or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension as in the solution to the formal artistic problem . Like Miles , the writer in John Fowles 's novel Mantissa , I look forward to the " sexy parts . " Which does n't mean that I like only erotica . It does mean that I delight in the attempt to translate the physical details of the world into art ? whether the art is deliberate , an artifact like a story or a painting , or only a stray thought , a narrative moment . We live in our heads ; no wonder we enjoy the intellectual equivalent of a hard-on , pleasure at the fact of creation , even if the act of creation is merely identifying ? reeshark , about two feet long , was washed up on the beach . Its belly was very white and streaked with blood , which looked like water stains on wallpaper . The gills and eye sockets were filled with sand . The dorsal fin fluttered in the breeze . A little beyond the shark were the remains of what must have been a skate , although part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . The chunks of flesh that still stuck to the bones looked like clumps of tapioca pudding . Thoreau called the beach a vast morgue . That has n't changed . Between Wellfleet and Provincetown I saw half a dozen more dead sand sharks , the stinking carcass of an animal that could have been a dog , the remains of a seagull covered with flies that buzzed away in a cloud when I approached , small dead fish that looked like spilled exclamation points , and , of course , shells , all that remained of clams , scallops , cockles , and limpets . I walked through patches of dried kelp that rustled like autumn leaves . For a while , I strolled along popping the little air bladders in the strands of rockweed . Where the beach was deserted , gulls stood in crowds , each gazing over the heads of the others , like guests at a chic party on the lookout for celebrities . Later , I noticed crowds of gulls that all faced the same way , south , into the breeze . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat on the beach , drank some more coffee , ate a gritty blueberry muffin , and , having stripped , ran through the chilly air into the waves . I came out , dried myself , dressed , and drank some warm whiskey out of a pint bottle I 'd been carrying in my back pocket . By two in the afternoon I had reached the Truro shore , inure than halfway from Eastham to Province town . The day after I graduated from Amherst College , in 1967 , I headed ? as I did after school ended every year for the Cape , detouring by way of Providence , Rhode Island , to visit my grandparents . That morning , my grandfather had awakened hardly able to breathe . The doctor was there when I arrived , examining him . My grandfather gazed up at me mildly , unable to speak , smiling over the doctor 's shoulder . Six and a half feet tall , broad as a refrigerator , white hair like hot phosphorus , he had loomed over me in my childhood , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? looking up from below as if at skyscrapers ? hut also because he seemed , with his pawlike fists and booming laugh , an elemental force , a hurricane or an earthquake . He had always been a heroic and comic figure , like Oargantua , Falstaff , or Paul Bunyan . On his back , in bed , he looked shrunken , defeated , apologetic . By the time I left the room he had become ? in the story I told myself about his life ? a tragic figure : perhaps still Falstaff , but the Falstaff at the end of Henry IV , Part 2 . Even his hair , once as fiery as a halo , was now the dingy yellow of old teeth . My grandmother had called my parents , who were on their way from their home in Springfield , Massachusetts . She took me into the living room , where we sat , made formal by death , before glass-fronted bookcases filled with Hebrew prayer books and a set of Dickens . These were the only volumes she 'd kept from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to America and was sewing dresses in a sweatshop in New York City . The rest of the collection , about 500 books , was intended to form the core of a library for the children of the village in Lithuania where she had been born ; but when she took the books to Europe shortly before World War I , the wooden trunks in which they were packed were stolen at a railway terminal in Poland . Having come so far , she did n't want to cancel her trip , so she continued on her way , carrying the stories in her head . Surrounded by the children of her village , she recited what she could remember of Oliver Twist , David Copper-field , and Great Expectations , placing the events in twentieth-century New York City , nor nineteenth-century London , to make them more immediate , as though they were true tales she was importing from her experience in the New World , tales in which ? out of tribal loyaltyRiah ( the Jew in Our Mutual . Friend ) became the hero and Fagin a ruined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the Lower East Side in jalopies . Despite how fast and loose she played with Dickens 's plots , my grandmother worshiped books and felt unworthy of them . The one time she visited me at college , she refused to go into the library ? a great campus attraction , which JFK had dedicated a few weeks before he 'd been shot ? because ( she said ) she was n't dressed properly . As I tried to convince her that she was dressed just fine , the bells of Johnson Chapel tolled the hour , and my grandmother turned white . I loved the sound of the bells . For me , they evoked a sense of community ; they transformed the landscape into a Norman Rockwell painting . For my grandmother , the sound was murderous . In the village in which she was born , Christians rang church bells as they rode through the Jewish quarter , killing and burning . In us , the bells set off clashing stories ; and the stories kept us apart . Trying to distract me ? and herself ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that I had graduated , what I intended to do . " I 'm going to be a writer , " I said . She grabbed my hands and squeezed them as though I 'd blasphemed . " That 's not something we do , " she said . " That 's for the gentry . " I pulled away . Furious ? maybe because I half believed her ? I grabbed my rucksack , slammed from the house , and , when I got to the corner of the block , stuck out my thumb and hitched to the Cape . When I got to Tniro , I called Providence to apologize . My mother told me my grandfather had died that afternoon . I said I 'd hitch back the next morning . I spent the night in a shack I 'd rented , an abandoned gas station with a huge plate-glass window facing the highway . There were no curtains . In full view of the passing cars , on my old portable typewriter , I wrote about how my grandmother had refused to enter the Amherst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson Chapel bells , trying to reduce the distance between us by making her story part of my story . orth of Truro , a surfer in a black wet suit flopped in flippers down to the ocean . He looked like a great lizard that had learned to walk erect , one of the creatures from Karel Capek 's novel War With the Newts . A woman , bundled in a parka and with a plaid blanket wrapped around her legs , waited for him onshore , fiddling with a portable radio . When Thoreau arrived on the Cape , he saw two organ grinders on their way to Provincetown , who , he thought , would provide the only music to be found in the towns he would be passing . I had become a human sundial . At the beginning of my hike , my shadow had been behind me and to my left . As I walked up the Cape , my shadow had moved clockwise around me until at noon it had been right in front . By the time I reached the Highland Light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my right . Thoreau had stayed overnight at the Highland Light and had talked at length with the lighthouse keeper . I scrambled up the cliff grabbing on to the beach grass . At the top was a field . The breakers , below , were abruptly softer , as if someone had turned the volume down . Crickets chirruped in the bushes . A bobwhite called off to the left . It was idyllic . The wind had changed , coming now from the southwest . All the stalks of grass leaned over in the light breeze and pointed the same way . Beyond the field were radar domes , dimpled like golf balls . To the right was the lighthouse with a high fence around it . When Thoreau walked up the Cape , he had been a welcome distraction to the lighthouse keeper . Now , the lighthouse was off-limits to hikers . I slid back down the cliff and headed up the beach to Provincetown . For a while , I was kept company by a woman riding a horse along the sand . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which would splash up and make the horse toss its head . Another dead shark , dried , gutted , and collapsed like a punctured inflatable toy , lay nearby . Beyond that I found the arm of a doll , a rubber snake , a toy horse , and a plastic dinosaur scattered over the sand , looking like the failed attempts of a bungling god to populate a dead planet . Outside of Provincetown , I passed a section of beach that had been fenced off as a tern colony : a separate sire set apart for birds ? it seemed the most alien thing to Thoreau 's world that I had seen . I climbed the cliff and followed a footpath through the dunes . The obvious difference between Thoreau 's Provincetown and ours lies in a reversal of the public and private . The outward aspect of the houses and shops frequently suggested a poverty which their interior comfort and even richness disproved . Provincetown now presents a rich mask , hiding an impoverished life . During the summer , Commercial Street , Provincetown 's main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spun sugar , saltwater taffy , fudge , hot dogs , hamburgers , ice cream , fried clams , portraits in chalk , tintypes ( customers dress up in clothes from Thoreau 's time and have their pictures taken so they 'll look in the photos like their own great-grandparents , so they 'll become their own ancestors ) , ceramics , " Poetic Impressions : original pen and ink prints and poetry , personalized for you by the poet , $1.50 matted , $1.00 unmatted , " trinkets . The music from one bar merges with the music from another bar up the street . People lounge at outdoor cafes , watching the passing circus . In the late summer , the town seemed as deserted as an off-season amusement park . In a bar , a man was sipping a drink , apparently oblivious to the blond girl holding him around the waist and resting her cheek against his shoulder . At a table in the back of the room satthe man in the red plaid shirt I 'd been shadowing all day . I wanted to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time I 'd ordered my drink he was gone . Later , I walked out along the pier . Mist was coming off the water in strands like cigarette smoke . At the end of the dock , a 7. man was urinating into the harbor . hen I look at old photographs of the Cape ? or of New York City , or of anyplace ? I rarely try to imagine what life was like then . Instead , I try to fit the past into the present . I like to go to the location where the picture was snapped and try to conjure the image up , so can see how it would look on that spot now . When I was writing a biography of August Belmont , a nineteenth-century financier and sportsman , I used to walk up Broadway from the Battery to Prince Street , where Niblo 's Garden used to stand , superimposing old New York on the present city . The past has its own geography , crosshatched with emotional longitudes and latitudes . It is no longer a physical place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past ? the stories about the past ? to nourish us . And we need nourishment . We are hungry as Saturn . But , unlike Saturn , we devour not our own children , but those who lived before us . We are continually doing what I did with nay grandmother 's memories of tolling church bells , what I do with Thoreau 's Cope Cod every time I repeat his walk : making the past part of the present , and making of the present one more story that will feed us in the future . Every day , we turn life 's Chinese boxes inside out . At the center is the infinite universe ; then , each a little larger and enclosing the last , come successive realities all the way down to our country , our city , our community , our family , until , on the outside , enclosing everything , is ourselves . In Islamic legend , a king sewed up a peacock 's head in a bag so there would be nothing to distract from the beauty of its tail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all existence was encompassed within the limits of the hag . Its beauty was beyond its comprehension . The stories we tell ourselves are a way of seeing through the bag , a way of making the Chinese boxes transparent , so that we can see through our own lives into the infinite heart of the puzzle . The stories help us comprehend whatever beauty our lives accidentally make as we blindly move through time . I returned to the bar . The man with the girl draped over him was still sipping his drink . He muttered , " Unreal , unreal , unreal . "
