If a proposal before the Berkeley city council becomes law , hoteliers will be offering more than a bed , bath and Gideon Bible . Leland Traiman , a registered nurse who treats AIDS patients , has suggested that the city help combat the spread of the disease by requiring hotels and motels to equip each guest room with safe-sex information kits , including condoms . The kits would also be distributed at some local massage parlors and saunas . " There could be a sign with each kit saying , THE BIBLE MAY SAVE YOUR SOUL , BUT THIS WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE , " says Traiman . Some innkeepers fear that guests might find the kits offensive . Elie Cukierman , owner of the venerable Shattuck Hotel , suggests an alternative : a sign in each room stating that condoms are available free , on request .
