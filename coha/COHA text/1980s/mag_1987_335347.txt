It is disheartening to know that Michael Jackson , having acquired the publishing rights to the Beatles ' music , has decided to cash in on it by making it available for corporate commercialization ( ( SHOW BUSINESS , May 18 ) ) . The specter of Jackson 's developing a list of " only 40 ( ( songs ) ) you 'll ever possibly see in an ad " is an insult to rock music . <P> Nirmal Goswami <P> Arlington , Texas <P> Rock fans are complaining because a Beatles " classic " will be used to advertise Nike sneakers . But nobody complained when Tchaikovsky 's Nutcracker Suite was used in a commercial for cat food or the Brandenburg Concertos advertised German cars and French mustard . My heart bleeds for the Beatles fans who take the commercialization of their heroes ' songs so seriously . <P> Ronald W.
