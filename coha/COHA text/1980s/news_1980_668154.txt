The New Republic sticks it to James Earl Carter , endorsing John Anderson for President , and claims the enterprise is one of liberal principle . Newsweek is the more interesting of the newsmags this time out . Its cover story is a delightful survey of editorial cartoonists who have been sticking it to Carter for months and appear unanimous in their separate explanations . Prime Time has some interesting dispatches for us older goats , while Ms. remains an embarrassment . Fortune deserves attention , as do Playboy , the New Yorker and the Phoenix . Clearly the magazine fellas are back from summer vacation . - The New Republic has turned into a veritable brawler in the drawing room of political ideals . The liberal journal has been trashing and thrashing Carter for weeks , but the Oct. 4 issue makes what went before seem pretty mild . The Anderson endorsement begins : " John Anderson ' s main asset is that he is not Jimmy Carter . " NR says that if Reagan is the principal beneficiary of an Anderson vote , he is preferable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President as an unprincipled , incompetent hack without any saving graces . The cartoonists , led by Jeff MacNelly and including Szep of this journal , told Newsweek interviewers that they enjoy smiting Carter and every other pol in sight because it ' s good , dirty fun . They do it because they like doing it , just as you suspected . Pete Axthelm was dispatched to cover the Holmes-Ali fight in Las Vegas , an assignment as obvious as the headline chosen for his story - " Requiem For A Heavyweight . " Nice job . George Will ' s concluding essay follows the hue and the cry : He carves a large chunk out of the Carter claim to re-election . - Prime Time promotes itself as a magazine " For the generation in the middle . " The middle is not otherwise defined , which is probably diplomatic . A. B. Guthrie Jr . ( " The Big Sky " ) reports on " Marrying a Younger Woman . " No one but a cad or bounder would admit to having done anything else , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Prime Time evidently thinks Guthrie ' s fine novelistic corpus requires that he be credited with " Shane , " which may startle Jack Schaefer ) . There is also an interesting piece on faddish nutrition . - Ms. is a magazine put out by militant feminists , addressed only to feminist readers . Gloria Steinem is a good writer when she speaks to general audiences . That no longer happens very often . In the October Ms. she speculates on where Hitler would have stood on the abortion question . Then there is a long excerpt from Jane O ' Reilly ' s forthcoming book , " The Girl I Left Behind Me . " In this O ' Reilly attributes a long , fallow period of daffiness to her upbringing as a girl . This is illustrated with snapshots from Jane ' s family album . Sexual equality prevailing over chivalry , I declare it to be navel- gazing maundering. - Fortune for the 20th has another barrage by Alexander Stuart , toasting the airlines on their own spit of free-enterprise bungling in the wake of government deregulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 is a self-made millionaire and apparently a tedious toad as well . If you rage at the ads on the devil box , you should read Geoffrey Colvin ' s fine report on the fiddling that the networks and the advertisers do , trying to clip a few extra bucks off each other in the process of getting you steamed . Martin Mayer knows something about money , and so does Merrill Lynch ; the brokerage house has a new wrinkle on personal finances that looks a hell of a lot like regulated banking . As usual , Daniel Seligman ' s column displays absolutely no restraint in making sport of everyone in sight , and also as usual , it is great . - Playboy for November should be introduced in evidence against Yr . Obt . Svt. by any female person wishing to justify the balderdash published by Ms. " Entertainment For Men " this month has a lot of skin pictures , fleshed out as it were with gaga copy describing how all them naked folk do all kinds of derring do , and one , count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to read . Emanuel Greenberg wrote that one and it ' s about chocolate . Read it down at the tire store , while you ' re waiting for your fall inspection sticker. - John Updike is a marvelous writer , but of course you probably knew that . The New Yorker for Oct. 6 carries his short story , " Still Of Some Use . " Also included in this issue is the second installment of Thomas Whiteside ' s disquieting and thorough inquiry into the publishing business , this one dealing with the mega buck agents who mostly package dreck for book and film . Depressing , but important . Herbert Warren Wind wrote about tennis with his usual mastery . Good issue - shame if you miss it . - Last Sunday ' s Phoenix had John Hubner on selling Bibles . See also Michael Gee on sports . Alan Lupo had a long piece on the First National Bank and what it proposes to do about financing Boston neighborhoods , whether voluntarily or under outside suasion . Each in its own way very interesting . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WBZ-TV get those two bubbleheads now hosting Evening Magazine , and what is the explanation for this outrage ? George V. Higgins is a Globe columnist . B07985134
