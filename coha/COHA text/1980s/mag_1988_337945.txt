American women are taking up arms . Propelled by a rising tide of crime , more and more of them no longer seem willing to trust their safety solely to their husbands , their neighbors or the local police . Between 1983 and 1986 , as gun sales to men held steady , gun ownership among women jumped 53% , to more than 12 million , according to a Gallup poll commissioned by gunmaker Smith &; Wesson . Even more striking , the poll found that the number of women who were considering buying a weapon quadrupled , to nearly 2 million . <P> The movement to own and carry guns is spread fairly evenly among age groups , across professions and around the country . " These are young women , older women ; many are professional , but some are housewives , " says Barbara Mueller , vice president of the Illinois State Rifle Association . " They do n't have a cigarette dangling from the corner of their mouth , and they 're not closet commandos . " Though more women are appearing at shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really the issue . The vast majority who are buying guns  --  about 75% , by most estimates  --  are doing so to protect their homes and themselves . <P> Gun owners and sociologists agree that the trend reflects a change of thinking , a rejection of traditional roles . Jerome Skolnick , a professor at the University of California law school at Berkeley , describes the increased gun ownership among women as a " gender revolution . The notion that only men protect is no longer valid . " Agrees Teryl Jansons , a Massachusetts attorney : " People are less apt to take advantage of your situation , since you do n't look like you 're afraid  --  because you 're not . " <P> Shooting instructors observe that women view guns more coldly , and cautiously , than do men . Some suggest that women make better shots . " Men come in with all sorts of bad habits , " says Michael Freire of the Tamiami Range and Gun Shop in Florida . " They see themselves as either Rambo , Roy Rogers or Daniel Boone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning to shoot . " Discipline is the whole point of training , " explains Carol Kolen , a Chicago psychologist who has taken shooting lessons . " It gives me the feeling that I could take care of myself . " Most female gun owners , say police officials , are careful to abide by the laws regulating possession of handguns . But women are less likely than men to advertise their ownership of a weapon . " I do n't go around bragging about it , " says Karen Elise , 31 , from Beverly Hills , whose parents were robbed late one night last year . " I do n't think it 's good for people to know . " <P> The new gun market has prompted manufacturers to design lightweight weapons with smaller grips , purses with built-in holsters and other accessories aimed at female buyers . Last month Shotgun News even sponsored a " gun and fashion show " in which scantily clad models demonstrated how a woman in a bikini can carry a concealed weapon ( in her hairbow ) . A how-to video , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , has sold more than 8,000 copies .
