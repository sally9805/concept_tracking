The lucky ones find jobs flipping burger patties at their neighborhood McDonald 's or pitching bales of hay on Wyoming cattle ranches . The less fortunate kill time shooting baskets in asphalt schoolyards or hanging around the local pool hall . Always the most volatile , lowest-paid segment of the work force , America 's job-seeking youth are headed for hard times this recession-plagued summer .
