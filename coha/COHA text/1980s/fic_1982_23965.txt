50 A TOMB WITH A VIEW A story . by Paul Theroux HERE 'S another woman to see you , " my secretary said , giving me an old-fashioned look on " another . " It had been a bad morning  --  I knew she was thinking about Mr. Fleamarsh 's ashes . Mrs. Fleamarsh had come in a few days before . Her husband had complained of chest pains on the train to Salisbury , missed the cathedral , collapsed on the bus , and died at Stonehenge . She insisted on having him cremated , so that she could carry him in her handbag . Is there a more presumptuous statement than " He would have wanted it this way " ? Accompanying his coffin back to Baltimore would have meant her missing the tour of the Lake District , and Stratford was tomorrow . Mrs. Fleamarsh gave me to understand that a whole , unburnt , adult human corpse was a terribly inconvenient thing . " He bowled a lot , " she said , as if this was all the explanation I needed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those shiny blue jackets . " I arranged for the cremation , but as Mrs. Flea-marsh was in Stratford , the ashes were delivered to me at the embassy . The urn , the size and shape of a white crock of Gentleman 's Relish , stood on my desk for most of the afternoon . And it put me in the mood for what happened later that day , though I would willingly have missed it all  --  Mrs. Flea-marsh , the ashes of her husband , and Miss Gowrie and her dark lodger . Miss Gowrie , the other woman  --  she had watery eyes and a wind-reddened face  --  introduced herself as a friend of Sir Charles Smallwood , whom I dimly remembered having met at Horton 's reception . Miss Gowrie , I guessed , was nearing seventy . She sat down and planted both her feet on the carpet to steady herself , and began squashing her handbag in her lap . She said , " I 'm afraid I have rather a shocking story to tell you . I mentioned it to Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Smallwood ? " and he said I should come straight to you . " I thought she was a bit drunk or having trouble Paul Theroux lives in London . His most recent novel , The Mosquito Coast , was published by Houghton Mifflin last spring . with her dentures . In fact , she was straining to speak in a dignified way  --  she was fighting her cockney accent and losing . She had a voice of astounding monotony . I said , " Go on . " " Well " ? wayew --  " it 's about my lodger , is n't it ? " She looked around the office , she peered at the walls , she spoke again . She was one of those people who seem  --  in the way they whisper and squint  --  to be addressing eavesdroppers . " Mind you , I 'm not really a landlady in the normal way . It 's just that I live in Mortlake and the Council put up me rates , did n't they ? Practically doubled them . I had to take in lodgers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What color , Miss Gowrie ? " " There 's only one color , " she said . " Black . One of yours . " I tried to convey , with silence and cold eyes , that I did not like this at all . " And that 's why I 'm here , " she said . " Because your lodger is black ? " " Because he 's a thief . " Feef was what she said . " British ? " " Of course not . " " Before you go any further , I think I should remind you that this is the American embassy , " I said . " Properly speaking , if you have a problem with your lodger you should go to the police . " " He 's one of yours , " she repeated . " American . And he 's driving me mental . It 's not fair ! " " How do you know he 's a thief ? " " He keeps the rubbish under his bed , do n't he ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pots and pans and that . He 's driving me mental . " As she spoke , I resolved to check the man 's citizenship . I did n't like Miss Gowrie 's manner . She behaved as if she were holding me responsible for this thieving lodger . I hoped I could get rid of her without becoming involved in her problem . I had had enough that day dealing with the ashes of Herbert Fleamarsh . The worst problems in any office arise at roughly four in the afternoon . It was four-ten , and I wished I had gone home early . 51 " Mr. Wubb has no right whatsoever to come here and steal from people . Some college student ! I suppose he 's studying how to steal . Why do n't he stay in his own country and steal ? " " That 's a good question , " I said , picking up the telephone . " Let 's see if the police have an answer to it . " " Oh , please , sir ! " she said , and her fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groveling . She looked suddenly frightened and small , and I felt genuinely sorry for her . " Please do n't tell them . It would be in all the papers . There 'd be talk . It would kill me . " " That you had a dishonest lodger ? " " That I had a flaming lodger at all , " she said . " I do n't want the rest of them to know . " " The rest ? " " The street , " she said . " They do n't take lodgers , certainly not black ones . They 're awfully decent . " She was asking me to agree with her . I said nothing . " He 's one of yours , " she said . " You 'll know what to do . " But he was n't , and I did n't . T SEEMED no business of ours , this light-fingered lodger who might or might not be an American . I checked the files . There was no one named Wubb registered with the embassy ? but not every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephoned me the next afternoon . She was desperate , and I had a free evening : the combination often ends badly . But I liked the idea of going upriver to Mortlake , so I visited her , just to look around , and perhaps to find excuses for my curiosity . " He 's rearranged all his furniture , has n't he ? " Miss Gowrie said , letting me into the tall , gloomy house . It was just off the Mortlake Road , which ran along the river , and the river could be seen  --  we were mounting the steps to the lodger 's room  --  from Miss Gowrie 's upper windows . On this wet black afternoon the river 's dampness seemed to penetrate every brick of the house , and the trees dripped gray water from the tips of their bony branches . " In his ? room , " she said . " He 's moved everything , every stick . " She threw his door open , releasing mingled smells , sweet and sour . Miss Gowrie saw me sniffing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That pong is all his . It hums sometimes . " I looked around the room and then turned to Miss Gowrie and said , " Tell me , does your lodger have a small bump or bruise  --  a little swelling , say ? right here on his upper forehead ? " " Yes  --  you 've seen him , " she cried . " Does he often wake you up in the middle of the night , padding around ? " " All the time ! Gives me a fright sometimes . How do you know about his bruise ? " " And have you noticed that he cooks at night  --  only at night  --  not during the day ? " " Yes ! " she said and clawed her hair straight . " Your lodger is a very devout Muslim , " I said . " Mussulman ? " she said , saying it like " muscleman , " and frowning . " I do n't know about that . And as for devout ? " " Oh , yes , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could face Mecca ? over there . " Miss Gowrie peered in the direction of Mecca , and , seeing only Barnes Common , made a face . " ? and taken down those pictures , " I said , examining a pair of framed prints stacked to face the wall : two busty ladies in black lace . " They hate pictures of human beings . " " Spanish , " Miss Gowrie said . " They 're the same as blacks ! " 52 " Here 's his prayer mat , " I said . " And he must be devout because he has a prayer bump on his forehead . The bruise  --  you 've seen it . Also , if he wakes you up at night , he must be saying his prayers five times a day . They bump their heads when they pray . " " He might not be praying  --  be might be cooking . " " Of course , Because this is the Muslim period of Ramadan . It 's like Lent , and it goes on until the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything until sundown . That 's why he eats at , ah " ? I had seen a small valise under the bed , and its luggage tag ? " Abdul Wahab Bin Baz . That explains it . " Instead of looking relieved , Miss Gowrie had become progressively worried by the information I had given her . And then she said , " Ai n't you glad you come over ? " " Miss Gowrie , he 's not one of ours , " I said . " He 's black , " she said . " Arab . " The Saudi Airlines luggage tag said everything : he was a Wahabi , he had flown from Mecca to London . A fanatical traveler ? " Do n't split hairs , " she said , and flung herself at me . She grasped my arm and exhaled the smell of bread and fish paste . " You know these people and their funny ways . You can help me . You 're the only one who can . The police do n't know about prayer bumps and eating after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked her where her lodger was . " College , " she said . " It 's a sort of night school . He goes out about six and comes back at nine . That 's when he starts eating . " " And praying , presumably . " " I would n't know about that , " Miss Gowrie said . " During the day he just frowsts in here . Studies and that . He 's a great reader . Mad about history . That 's what he told me . That 's all he told me . " " How long has he lived with you ? " " Two weeks . I only discovered he was pinching things two days ago . He must have been at it all last week . I thought then , out you go ! But I reckoned he might be dangerous , him being a thief . That 's why I called Charlie Smallwood , and he give me your name . You 'd know what to do  --  that 's what he told me . Only I wish you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at his Toot , " I said , Miss Gowrie got slowly to her knees , saying , " I used to have a proper charlady  --  I used to have staff , " and went on to say that she had discovered her lodger 's thievery while she was cleaning out his room . It was under the bed , in a couple of cardboard boxes . She brought out the boxes , spitting with effort as she did so , and showed me the oddest collection of stolen goods I had ever seen . There were two brass incense burners , properly called thuribles  --  they could have been a hundred years old . There was a brass lamp of oriental design and a pair of brass candlesticks . There was a metal crucifix and , lastly , a string of about twenty bells  --  round ones , about the size of golf balls , with a slit in each one . I had never seen any bells like this . Everything was thick with dust and coated with a kind of sour , damp rind , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cave . " You think it 's junk , " Miss Gowrie said , " then you look closer and you realize it might be valuable , A little Brasso and a dry rag  --  come up a treat . But if you get very close , it looks like junk again , and that 's what it is . So why go to the police ? All they 're going to do is laugh and say , ' Steady on , love . ' They wo n't treat it as a serious matter . But they do n't have to live here , do they ? " " Maybe it 's not serious , " I said . " You 're joking , " she said . " This is diabolical . You do n't get this in shops or houses . This ai n't the kind of thing that fell off the back of a lorry . Go on , touch it . " I took one of the bells and shook it . It had a dull sound , and no vibration  --  about as musical as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? Like from a church . I tell you , some of this stuff gives me the collywobbles . " KNEW what she meant . They were n't the sort of things that anyone would steal , and yet where could you buy them ? So they had to be stolen , probably from a church , from a derelict altar  --  a Muslim fanatic might do that . But what about those little round bells ? It was too late to do anything that day . I left Miss Gowrie with a promise that I would try to get to the bottom of it , and the next morning , with the aid of a good map , made a list of all the churches near her Mortlake house . There were seven . My secretary phoned each one and asked whether anything had been stolen from them . All had been burgled , but not within the previous two weeks . We tried a dozen more nearby churches : no luck . I was still not satisfied and so , that same afternoon , I went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Methodist chapel were both securely locked , but the Catholic church was open . I walked through it and into the deep grass of the churchyard . " Can I help you ? " It was a man with a broom , probably the caretaker , but he was suspicious of me and held his broom with the handle forward , like a weapon . " Hello , " I said brightly , to calm him . " Are you missing anything from the church  --  anything stolen ? I 'm thinking of things like candlesticks or crucifixes . " " Not that I know of , " he said , and yet he had an undecided look . He wanted to say more  --  he had something on his mind . 53 I said , " You 're very lucky then , " to give him an opening . " Not really , " he said . " We 've lost most of our outside lights  --  vandals . They broke every blooming one of them . " He showed me that all the floodlights in the churchyard had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the effect , on this gray afternoon , was somber , a sort of bleak and muffled violence . " I 'm amazed they could have broken lights that high , " I said . The spotlights were attached to the eaves of the church , thirty feet up . " They 're savages , " he said . " They use pellets , slingshots , blowpipes . " " Did you see them do it ? " " No , and I 'll tell you something else , " he said . " I 've worked here at St. Mary Magdalene 's for twenty-two years , and it 's the first time this has happened . The past two weeks have been terrible . Broken glass everywhere . It 's so dark at night ! " " Two weeks ? " I said , and thought of Mr. Wahab . " The first week was shocking . But this week has n't been so bad . There 's no more lights to break ! " He looked at me in a disgusted way and said , " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him I was . " You 're used to this sort of thing  --  vandals , villains , queue-jumpers , law-breakers . But this is n't New York or Chicago . This is the quietest part of London . People behave themselves here . At least , they used to . " We stood in darkness , because of the smashed lights . But this was the early daytime dark of November : it was not yet five o'clock . I decided to stop by the embassy before I went home . I was at my desk , wondering whether to call Miss Gowrie to tell her I had found out nothing , when my colleague Vic Scaduto appeared . Seeing me examining one of the strange round bells that the lodger had stolen , Scaduto said , " You 've got the craziest things in your office . Last time I was here there was a funeral urn with a tourist 's ashes in your pending tray . And now you 're playing with a camel bell ! " " How do you know that 's a camel bell ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is full of camels . My kids bought bells like that at the bazaar . They 're sort of ceremonial  --  they loop strings of them around a camel 's neck . " I said , " Can you think of any reason why you might find a camel bell like this in an English church ? " " I love it ! " he said , and left my office , snickering . Just before I went home , the phone rang . It was Miss Gowrie . " Can you come over straight away ? " she breathed . " He 's just gone out . " " Is there anything wrong ? " She said , " There 's another parcel , is n't there ? He brought it back last night then , did n't he ? The dirty devil ! " " Do n't open it . Do n't touch it . I 'll be right over . " She was waiting for me by the door , her hands knotted in her apron . She told me to hurry , and started upstairs . Twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be back any minute . " Mr. Wahab 's room was the same as before  --  very neat , the prayer mat facing Barnes Common and Mecca , a slight aroma of stale spice in the air , the pictures turned to the wall . After Miss Gowrie unlocked it , she stepped into the hallway to stand sentry duty while I opened the parcel under the bed . It was a pillowcase , its top twisted and held fast with a length of wire . It gave off the same dusty underground odor as the candlesticks and the crucifix and the came bells . It seemed to contain sticks of wood and broken pottery wrapped in newspaper . I removed them and saw at once that they were bones  --  old , yellow , spongy , woody bones  --  and the cracked bowl of a skull , and a jawbone , and a number of loose human teeth . " More of the same , " I said , so as not to frighten her . And I wrapped them and returned them to the 54 innocent-looking pillowcase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll do my best , " I said . I was relieved that she had not seen the contents of that new parcel , for I had always thought of myself as being fairly unshockable , and yet when I remembered those yellow bones and teeth and incense burners and camel bells under the bed of the Arab in that wet suburb of London , I got the shudders . T WAS no longer a trivial , speculative matter about a troublesome lodger . The man from Mecca was , quite simply , a grave robber . Mr. Wahab was a ghoul . Why had n't I thought of it before ? Though they looked like ecclesiastical items they could not have come from a church . But tombs , especially the larger ones , were often a kind of underground chapel , and had an altar furnished with candlesticks , and an incense burner and crucifix . It was almost certainly a Catholic tomb  --  the crucifix said that . An old tomb ; this stuff had lain undisturbed for a century . A large tomb , big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be entered through a door  --  if there had been digging it would have been seen and reported . The tomb was probably above ground . But what sort of tomb contained camel bells ? This part of London was full of cemeteries  --  we had cremated Herbert Fleamarsh in nearby Kew . There were five important cemeteries not far from Miss Gowrie 's house , and every church had a walled graveyard beside it . But only one of those churches interested me : it struck me that a grave robber needed darkness to hide him , and if he did not have it he might break the sort of lights I had seen smashed at St. Mary Magdalene 's . But no theft had been reported there . I did not want to see the caretaker again . He would wonder why I was back ; he would be suspicious ; he would ask awkward questions . I had no answers . So I let a day pass , and then I waited for the five o'clock darkness , and I entered the churchyard of St. Mary 's wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . I crept toward the vaults , the Eat-topped granite huts with iron doors , or sealed with stone blocks . They were unmarked , they were sadly neglected , and overgrown with high bushes . Some were hidden in grass , others had almost burst from the ground or been yanked aside by the roots of the trees . I was behind the church and fighting my way through a tangle of bushes when I saw the tent . It was a sort of oriental tent , perhaps Arab , with a slanting roof and high steep sides flowing from neatly scalloped eaves . I thought for a moment that I had stumbled upon a group of campers  --  people often pitched tents by the roadside or in parks ( I could see them from the windows of my fiat in Battersea ) . Why not in this graveyard ? But the tent was made of stone . It was white granite or marble , with carved folds , and it bore a tablet with the name Captain Sir Richard F. Burton . The explorer 's tomb was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried the door . The putty surrounding the door , a marble slab , had been dug away . But a padlock on a rusty hasp remained . I shook the padlock and it came apart in my hand : it had been sawed through . So he had broken it  --  I was sure that this was the work of Abdul Wahab Bin Baz . A poem was chiseled into the marble just above the door . I turned my small flashlight on it . Farewell , dear friend , dead hero , the great life Is ended , the great perils , the great joys ; And he to whom adventures were as toys , Who seemed to bear a charm ' gainst spear or knife Or bullet , now lies silent .. . What was that ? A sound from the churchyard gate . Crouching , I ran around to the back of the vault . It was not easy  --  trees grew close to it , and I scratched my face on a branch as I squeezed through . At the rear of the tomb , overgrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches , was an iron ladder . It was fixed to the stone and rose to the top of the tentlike roof . More to hide from the caretaker than to see where the ladder went , I climbed the iron rungs , and when I could not go any farther I looked down in amazement . I was looking straight into the chamber of the tomb . This tomb , this stone tent , had a window ! It was thick glass and I could see in the narrow beam of my flashlight that it had not been tampered with . But I knew at a glance that the tomb had been plundered . A century of sunlight through this window had faded the stone walls in places and also printed on them the shadows of the objects I had seen in the Arab 's room  --  the lamps , the crucifix , the string of camel bells . Where a thurible had been plucked from the dust a disk mark remained of its oval base . Only these shadows were left of what had once been in the tomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor , on either side of a row of footprints . The larger coffin had been opened . Its lid , a fraction lopsided , had a freshly yanked nail at its end and showed a seam of darkness . But if I had not already seen Burton 's bones , if I had not tried the lock that seemed so secure , I doubt that I would have noticed that the coffin lid was ajar or suspected any tampering . Even under the penetrating light of my pocket flashlight the tomb was very murky , and only serious scrutiny told me that it had been broken into . It was a terrible little coffin room , it was dusty , it was cell-like ; it gave me a good idea . The Arab , Abdul Wahab Bin Baz , had to be stopped . Now I knew how . It was no more than a short stroll , using the foot-55 bridge over the railway tracks , to a row of shops . In one of these , with a sign saying IRONMONGERS , I bought a large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fanatic from Mecca had cut through in order to enter Burton 's tomb . It was now well after six . The church was shut , the gate was locked . I scaled the brick wall of the churchyard and took up my position at the top of the ladder , where I rested against the slanting window of the tomb . I was completely hidden ; the graveyard was as dark as the bottom of a deep hole . In a doggedly destructive way , by breaking all the churchyard lights , the Arab had guaranteed that I would not be seen . I thought : What if he does n't come back ? And yet , Isabel Burton 's coffin had not been disturbed . Later than I expected , after seven , when my knees were about to give out , I heard the thump of feet in the churchyard  --  someone had come over the wail . There was a swishing sound of legs moving in brambles and grass . If it was Abdul , and if he entered the tomb , I would see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then there was a slow , millstone sound  --  the marble door being swung open . When he entered the tomb , I ducked , and I did not move again until , some seconds later , I heard the door being eased shut . It was not closed entirely . I climbed down the ladder , dashed to the front of the tomb , and kicked the door . At that moment there was a cry from the vault , but I was quickly straightening the hasp and clapping the padlock on . There was no sound from inside . The Arab was sealed in . No one would hear him . He had asked for this : and now he was buried alive . If you knew he was there and you listened carefully , you could hear a faint mewing , which was all that was audible of his wild screams through the thick marble walls of the tomb . THOUGHT it was him , " Miss Cowrie said , opening the door , with a look of apprehension still on her face  --  fright takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back tonight , " I said . " He may not be back at all . " " He 's out haunting houses , I expect , " she said . " Not exactly . " " You come in and have a nice cup of tea , " Miss Gowrie said . " Put your feet up . Look at the time ! It 's gone eight  --  you 've had a long day . " My day was not over . I told Miss Gowrie I had discovered where Wahab had stolen his brassware . I gathered up the objects and put them into a sack . I would return them to their rightful place , I said . " May I sleep in Mr. Wubb 's room tonight ? " I said . " What if he comes back ? " " Not a chance , " I said . " You never know with blackies , " she said . In his stale bed , in that small room that smelled of carpet dust and prayer sweat , I thought about Abdul Wahab and it occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was simple revenge . Had n't Burton , the unbeliever , trampled all over Islam ? In this Muslim 's eyes , had n't the English explorer violated the sanctity of his religion by dressing up as an Arab and entering Mecca ? Burton was no respecter of taboos or traditions  --  he had plundered the secrets of Islam in his search for adventure . This was one Muslim 's reply : the Arab dressed as an English gentleman , prowling undetected in London  --  as anonymous as Burton had been in holy Mecca . There was a crude justice in what the disguised Arab had done to Burton 's bones in the Mortlake churchyard . This was a civilized country and a different century , but the smell in that bedroom was of dust and bones and the stink of prayer . I had set my wrist alarm to wake me before dawn . It was still dark when I crept out of Miss Gowrie 's house . I liked the thrill , carrying the brassware and camel bells and Richard Burton 's bones through the damp , chilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no sound at the door of the vault . I went around back and mounted the ladder and shone my flashlight inside . Wahab lay on the floor , sleeping on his side , He woke when I turned the light on his eyes . This was the first time I had really seen him . His dark face had a stretched look of panic  --  the expression certain fish have in fishbowls : trapped and pop-eyed , with fat , swollen lips . His eyes were red and puffy , and he was in the last stage of terror . He was limp , making pleading faces at me  --  or rather at the light , and blinking at the brightness of it . He would have confessed at that moment to being Leon Trotsky . He clasped his hands and implored me . I breathed on the window . The vapor condensed , and with my finger I traced a cross in it and shone my flashlight on it . It is the simplest of symbols , but to the man from Mecca it was strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him more fearful than the darkness he had endured in that tomb all night . It was now safe to remove the padlock : I had announced myself as the avenging Christian . As soon as the hasp was released he pushed the door open , gasped  --  gave a whinny of fright  --  and then disappeared at the far end of the churchyard . It was still dark . I had plenty of time to replace the thuribles , the lamp , the candlesticks , the crucifix , and the camel bells , as well as Burton himself in his ornate and rotting coffin . Then I shut the door of the tomb and locked it . I had left everything just where it belonged in the tomb , as anyone could see . ?
