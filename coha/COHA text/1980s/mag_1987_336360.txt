Unlike the FORTUNE 500 or Standard &; Poor 's 400 , there is a roster of U.S. corporations to which no self-respecting chief executive aspires : the dishonor roll of companies charged by the Federal Government with failing to monitor adequately the safety of their workplaces . The list has swollen every month or so in the past year , as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has imposed unprecedented penalties on some of the nation 's biggest and best-known companies . Among them : Ford Motor and Chrysler ( the No. 2 and No. 3 U.S. automakers ) , Caterpillar ( No. 1 among makers of construction equipment ) , General Dynamics ( No. 1 defense contractor ) and IBP ( No. 1 meat-packer ) . <P> Amid all this apparent vigilance , America 's 112 million workers should be able to breathe easier , knowing that Uncle Sam is doing everything possible to ensure safer plants , factories , agricultural fields and offices . But perhaps not . The headline-grabbing cases imply that a watchful eye is being cast toward workers ' safety ; nonetheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of injuries and illnesses . This year 's proposed fines , ranging from $477,000 for Ford to $2.59 million for IBP , were the highest ever levied by OSHA , but the penalties posed little financial hardship for the companies . Critics , including many union leaders , charge that OSHA is not taking enough action to combat the hazards of dangerous equipment and noxious chemicals that can lead to ailments , injuries and deaths . " OSHA laws are supposed to improve a worker 's chance of getting home safely to his family , " says Davitt McAteer , director of the Occupational Safety and Health Law Center , a public-interest law firm in Washington . " But the worker has less protection than he did eight years ago . " <P> If that is true , some of the responsibility may rest with the President . In his 1980 campaign , Ronald Reagan attacked OSHA for imposing nitpicking , burdensome regulations on business . Within nine months after Reagan took office , the agency made a major policy shift . In the most dangerous industries , OSHA began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory floors and instead began relying on checks of the companies ' own records . Only if employers ' safety logs showed illness and injury rates to be above the national average in manufacturing did OSHA staffers consider wall-to-wall inspections . To lessen the chance of such unwelcome scrutiny , some employers apparently started doctoring their logs to underreport or hide serious accidents . But OSHA did not begin to crack down with heavy fines on major record-keeping violations until last year . Critics contend that only pressure from Congress and the approaching 1988 election galvanized the agency into action .
