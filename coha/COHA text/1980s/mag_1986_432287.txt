 | OK , drivers , here 's the bottom line : on the best available evidence , raising the speed limit to 65 miles an hour on rural interstate highways could cost 500 lives and 500 serious injuries every year . The trade-off is time , a lot of it . Each of those lives could save 100 years of driving . You decide : is it worth it ? The evidence is questionable , the math is mind boggling and the ethics are impossible . But that bemusing question is the real heart of the chronic muddle of the 55-milean-hour national speed limit , a policy issue that infuriates drivers , paralyzes politicians and provokes more national hypocrisy than anything short of religion and sex . Last week the war of the speed traps and radar detectors was once again at a midsummer high . Two states were about to lose federal highway funds for insufficient compliance with the law . Eleven Western governors , whose constituents yearn most fiercely for higher limits , called on Congress to repent , and a sympathetic White House booked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time soon . For one thing , despite all the complaints about the " double nickel " limit , most Americans do n't want the law changed . Polls consistently show majorities in favor of keeping the 55-mile limit ; a new Gallup sounding , due out this week , is not expected to differ much from the 71 percent landslide found in 1984 . But such figures hide major regional and demographic discrepancies . Support for the law , for instance , is lowest in the Western states and highest among those who drive least . And polls that probe deeper find still more ambiguities . In California , 47 percent of the drivers favor keeping the limit . But support drops dramatically if it is stipulated that tickets would be given for speeds below 62 mph , and 74 percent admit to speeding occasionally themselves . Nowhere is the national schizophrenia more evident than on the open road , where it sometimes seems literally nobody is obeying the law . " It 's crazy , " says Leonard DeGroff , a regional chief of the California Highway Patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying . People will see a black-and-white and go shooting by anyway . I do n't know what the hell the reason is . " By actual measurement , 75 percent of vehicles on monitored stretches of rural interstate highways were exceeding the limit last year . Of necessity , enforcement is selective . " It 's hard to give someone a ticket for going 60 when everyone else is going 65 , " says Sgt. George Clements of the sheriff 's department in Houston . Under good road conditions in most states , cars are n't stopped unless they are driving more than 5 miles over the limit ; in some , the tolerance rises to 10 miles . The Texas Highway Patrol , says spokesman David Wells , tries to keep average speeds down by zeroing in on " more significant violations . " Translation : the majority of tickets are given in the 65- to 75-mph range , though troopers insist that some cars are still ticketed at 56 mph . And penalties vary wildly ( chart ) . Some states impose fines of up to $100 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of license and a notice to insurers that can cost money at renewal time . Others , particularly flat states with open spaces , set fines as low as $5 for an offense that is called " wasting motor fuel " and requires @#  | no points or notification . There is no evidence that crackdowns make people obey the law . California handed out more than 1 million tickets last year ( versus 257,000 in New York ) and levied fines up to $50 , but a state official once estimated that for every speeder caught , 22,000 get away . It 's a figure that could make a Smokey turn in his hat and sunglasses . For determined speeders , the first line of defense in the war with troopers is a radar detector . Truckers in particular have come to rely on them ; a driving teacher argues that in the Eastern states a truck driver carrying a legal load at legal speeds can make only $8 an hour , and thus is almost forced either to speed or overload . A survey in Maryland found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nonprofessional drivers are grabbing them up , too : a leading producer , Cincinnati Microwave , says it sold 400,000 of its $245 Escort and $295 Passport models last year , a 46 percent increase over 1984 . The detectors alert drivers to a radar beam over a range of one mile in normal highway conditions , providing enough time to slow down . They are outlawed in Connecticut , Virginia and the District of Columbia , but an active lobby has stopped similar bills in 27 other states . The bad news is that even when the beep is n't touched off by dish antennas or microwave ovens , the value of radar detectors is often mainly psychological . In the escalating high-tech war , the forces of law have @# come up with a radar gun that emits no warning waves until it is pointed at a suspect car and the button is pushed . " By the time the Fuzzbuster beeps , we 've already got ' em , " boasts Georgia trooper Rhonda Page . Police are also using computers that calculate speed from the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar devices are being used in helicopters and planes that alert lurking patrol cars . Some speeders are retaliating with jamming devices that can block radar altogether or return a deceptively innocent reading . But these are dubiously effective , expensive ( $650 to follow one build-it-yourself plan ) and illegal in all 50 states . Miracle cure : The logic of the double nickel is childishly plain : speed kills . But opponents maintain it is n't that simple . True enough , when the national limit was imposed in 1974 as an energy-saving measure after the Arab oil embargo , the highway toll fell abruptly , from 55,000 deaths in 1973 to 46,000 in 1974 . That drop turned the law into a safety measure , a miraculous conversion that opponents resent more with each drop in oil prices . Since then the national death rate has continued to fall , even though speeds actually driven have been rising . Last year there were only 2.48 deaths for every 100 million vehicle miles driven , down from 2.58 in 1984 and 4.24 in 1973 . Especially on the interstates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the death rate continued to fall as speeds rose ( chart , page 17 ) . The only explanation is that other factors have been at work : seat-belt and childrestraint laws went into effect , campaigns against drunken driving changed habits , auto design improved , better roads were built . Doctors may have learned how to save traffic victims who would have died a decade ago . If there is any direct correNEWSWEEK : JULY 21 , 1986 15  | lation between speed and safety , concedes a Department of Transportation expert , " it 's impossible to isolate . " To a large extent , the whole argument is sophistry . Speed affects safety ; common sense says that an accident at 65 mph might not take place at 55 and the one at higher speed will almost surely do a lot more damage . The National Research Council , asked by Congress to study the results of 10 years of living with the national law , cranked up its computers and concluded that the 55-mile limit saves from 2,000 to 4,000 lives a year ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit ? Apart from the fact that people enjoy fast driving , the only rational argument is the time saved . According to the NRC , a 65-mph limit would cost 500 lives and 500 serious injuries a year on rural interstates , which carry 19 percent of the nation 's fast traffic but have only 4 percent of total fatalities . At 1 billion driver hours per year , the enormous time savings might justify the added toll . A good many cops , weary of the unequal struggle , are ready to go along with higher limits on interstates . But others argue that the whole war would simply escalate again . " If they do raise it , say to 65 , you 're going to start seeing speeds of 80 and 85 , and we 're going to see more traffic deaths , " said Texas 's Wells . So far , that logic has prevailed . At least four bills are pending in Congress to raise the limit , but Rep. James Howard , whose Public Works and Transportation Committee could bottle them up , believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averaging 70 mph , up from 59.5 last year . And 70 , he says , " is an unsafe speed . " That impasse leaves state governments in deep and worsening trouble . Under the law , they must enforce the limit on at least half the cars traveling roads posted at 55 mph or lose up to 10 percent of the federal highway funds they would be entitled to . The fact that three-quarters of all drivers on the interstates now violate the law has led to an intricate set of seriocomic games , in effect a conspiracy tween the states and DOT to keep the law from being invoked . For openers , federal rules permit elaborate " adjustment " of the figures ? invari-@#  | ably downward ? to offset presumed inaccuracies in speedometers , errors in sampling and the like . In 1983 fully 37 states had more than 50 percent of their traffic in violation , but all were able to fudge the figures enough to be in technical compliance . In 1984 three states ? Vermont , Maryland and Arizona ? went over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasted for two years in a row , they would lose funds ; and sure enough , the same three states , plus Rhode Island and New Hampshire , tipped the scales last year . Maryland has appealed ; Vermont and Arizona have been invited to negotiate their fines : a possible $5.1 million for Arizona , $1.9 million for Vermont . As average speeds rose to test the limits of creative bookkeeping , some states turned to other measures . In theory , automatic monitoring devices are placed along highways and switched on at random intervals to sample vehicle speed . In practice , state officials may place the devices selectively ( say , on a steep upgrade ) and state troopers who know where they are can station patrol cars in plain view nearby to slow traffic . " We could make a one-act play out of our monitoring practices that would have the bureaucrats rolling in the aisles , " says Wallace Stickney , commissioner of transportation in New Hampshire . " Everyone is skulking around watching each other . " But for all their efforts , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some are also close to revolt : Nevada tried unilaterally raising the speed limit on one stretch of road to 70 mph two weeks ago , only to buckle when DOT threatened to cut the flow of money . And all of them complain that trying to enforce the speed law hampers their efforts to deal with more pressing problems , such as drunken driving . The Reagan administration sympathizes with the states , particularly with their claim to the right to set their own traffic laws , and there is at least some support for raising the limit . In the Oval Office , an aide last week noticed a magazine on Ronald Reagan 's desk open to an article on the problem , and the Domestic Policy Council is scheduled to start a review of the issue within a month . But given the polls and the regional nature of the pressure , Reagan is n't likely to spend any political capital on this hot potato . " It 's not a battle we want to fight , " said a senior aide .
