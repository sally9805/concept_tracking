The reports of the Bruins ' early departure fromthe playoffs were somewhat premature . Last night they did what coach Harry Sinden told them to ; played the same as they had in defeat in Tuesday night . This time they won with a three-goal second period , 4-1 , in the Garden , and evened their best-of-five series with the Pittsburgh Penguins at one game apiece . And the Penguins finished up last night ' s game playing as though they weresatisfied to have won Tuesday . Wayne Cashman put the game out of the Penguins ' reach at 11:15 of the third period , lifting a rebound of an Al Secord shot into the goal . The game didn ' t start that way . It began like a replay of Tuesday ' s game , with the Bruins forechecking their way into puck contol in the Pittsburgh end , and goalie Greg Millen making all the necessary stops . And , like Tuesday , the Penguins were delighted to get out of the first period with a 0-0 tie . Rarely did Pittsburgh send its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let the Bruins carry the play and wait for opportunities . The first indication that Millen was ready to play again came with less than two minutes gone . He stuck out his pad to block a Ray Bourque shot and then straightened up to catch Al Secord ' s whack at the rebound . That was how Pittsburgh would play - sitting back , getting that good goaltending and patiently waiting for the breaks . Twice in the first period the Penguins broke out to attack , but overall they had just six shots at Gerry Cheevers - only two of them particularly dangerous . " That ' s the way we expect them to play , " Sinden had said , " and if we play with the same action as we did Tuesday , it will be all right with me . " The first period wasn ' t totally all right with Sinden , for not all of Boston ' s 10 shots were scoring chances . Sinden would feel comfortable in the second period , for the Bruins played one of their dominant periods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This should have knocked Pittsburgh ' s strategy into a cocked hat , but the Penguins attacked only sporadically . The first step to driving Pittsburgh out of jamming in its own end came early in the period . And it began 180 feet awayfrom the Penguin goal . It was at the Boston goal line that Brad Park put a move on Rick Kehoe , faking one way and going the other . Ferguson fell down , and Park moved the puck quickly to Mike Milbury . With Kehoe down , the Bruins struck quickly before the Penguins could regroup in their end . Milbury spotted Rick Middleton breaking down the middle at the Pittsburgh blue line and fed him the puck , sending him through the defense and in alone on Millen . Millen came out to meet him , and Middleton backhanded the puck softly behind him and into the goal . That was at 1:42 , and the Bruins kept thepressure on through the next four minutes . Their second goal , however , didn ' t come until the middle of the period . This play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter McNab made some kind of trick play to receive a pass from Terry O ' Reilly . Somehow McNab got the puck , which was in the air , around to his stick while barely breaking stride . He cut right and backhanded a pass to the front of the goal , where Don Marcotte chopped it up into the middle of the goal . Boston ' s third goal came on a Park slap shot . He got to the puck inside the Pittsburgh blue line , went almost to the top of the circle and slapped the puck by Millen ' s right . Cashman was in front screening Millen . That came at 11:41 , and the Bruins had a 3-0 lead . It was Millen who prevented the margin from growing larger . He stopped Middleton on another breakaway later in the period , then robbed Marcotte in front . And the Bruins lost a Craig MacTavish goal because referee Wally Harris had blown the puck dead near the goalie . Things were not all that quiet in the Boston end with Cheevers making two sparkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hughes . Both shots were out of the right circle . Boston had a whopping 22-5 edge in shots on goal .
