// Will President Jimmy Carter lead the United States to war ? That question is worth pondering , for it 's a fact that the Democratic presidents preceding him in this century have shown themselves afflicted by a kind of war mania they seemed impotent to shake off . Presidents Woodrow Wilson , Franklin D. Roosevelt , Harry Truman and Lyndon Baines Johnson involved the U.S. directly in war , while President John F. Kennedy had taken the warlike step of dispatching some 16,000 U.S. combat troops to Vietnam by the time of his assassination in November 1963 . That is the war-prone record of Democratic presidents in the 20th century  --  up to Carter . It is a record to be feared . It is one the American people should get to understand . They should think about it , long and hard , for it has been enormously costly in human lives , in natural resources , in almost every conceivable way . In quest of that understanding , therefore , a start may be made by asking why Wilson came to break the promise implied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , " on which he was reelected to the presidency in 1916 . Could he have kept that promise ? The realistic answer must be no . U.S. interests could not then risk the very real chance of victory by the Central Powers in World War I. Those powers  --  principally Germany and Austria  --  had already demonstrated their capacity to seize without qualm the territory of other nations . The unprincipled German march through Belgium in 1914 had been compounded by the invasion of France and was to be underscored by the monstrous arrogance of the 1918 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with defeated Russia . So , less than a year after his reelection as a president devoted to keeping the nation out of war , Wilson led the nation into war . But the question remains : Could Wilson have taken steps to stamp out the sparks that ignited World War I ? Between his first inaugural in 1913 and the outbreak of war in August 1914 , could he have so put the fear of God into the German government in particular that it would have recoiled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the road ? Again the answer must be no . He scarcely had time . Nor was the handwriting as large , as glaring on the wall as it was later  --  and still is . Yet it 's one of the enigmas of history . Had he been a bigger man , could Wilson have realized  --  as a U.S. president should have  --  that the enormous productive capacity of the U.S. could make mincemeat of Europe 's quarrelsome nations ? That he had in his hand the means to make the heads of Europe 's aggressive states gibber with fear at the defeat awaiting them if they went to war and the U.S. came in on the opposing side ? In fact , this is exactly what happened . But the tragedy is that the World War I blood bath actually had to take place , and the U.S. had to add its 50,000 battle deaths to the war 's 10 million total to prove the point . But if Wilson was blind , what of the blindness of Franklin Delano Roosevelt  --  four-time elected president  --  whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1945 and beyond ? Living in luxury and of a family with old and lucrative roots in America , Roosevelt nonetheless made it plain he was a people 's person  --  tried and true . Would such a person then lead the American people suring them the same fate awaited nations foolish enough to risk American hostility in any subsequent war , he could have forced them to recoil in horror at the chasm opening beneath their feet . But he did no such thing . He gave no sign of having the will . His own policies denied him the means . Instead , with somber lament over " a date which will live in infamy , " he led the U.S. to war . He had promised " again and again and again : Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars . " But he presided over a war in which our " boys " fought from North Africa to Italy to the heartland of Germany , from Guadalcanal to New Guinea to the doorstep of Japan , sailed the world 's oceans or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war in which almost all able-bodied adult Americans were in some way mobilized , and its mammoth , eleventh-hour cost ? " Never before have we had so little time in which to do so much , " conceded Roosevelt  --  added more than $150 billion to the national debt . Yet the Roosevelt administration 's war aims were so ill-defined that at war 's end the road led inexorably ahead to further wars , the most catastrophic of which  --  the Vietnam War  --  grew directly out of Roosevelt 's chronic tendency to plan not historically , but provincially . Meanwhile , however , it was the turn of Harry Truman , this century 's third Democratic president , to lead the U.S. to war . His was the Korean War  --  sometimes known more euphemistically as the Korean Conflict . In fairness , it should be said that Truman fell heir to the vaguely conceived humanitarian schemes , largely undone by under-the-table deals with Soviet Russia , which constituted Roosevelt 's World War II aims and virtually promised that war , like marsh gas exploding from world-wide rot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manfully the burden of unfinished business that descended on him with Roosevelt 's abrupt demise only months after winning , in 1944 , a precedent-shattering fourth term in the presidency . But Truman seemed never fully to shake off the woolly Rooseveltian philosophy which tended to see communism not as a tyrannical revival of the old world but as an advanced , people-oriented form of self-government . Thus , author of the Truman Doctrine of opposition to communist designs in Europe  --  especially in Greece  --  he almost simultaneously perceived so little threat from communism in Asia that he trustingly ordered U.S. peace-keeping forces withdrawn from South Korea in 1949 . A year later , communist North Korea brazenly swarmed over the United Nations-drawn 38th parallel dividing North and South Korea , and the Korean War began . Truman called that war " a police action " ? a term hardly appreciated by those involved , although it had a certain rationality from the war 's purpose of punishment for disobedience to a U.N . initiative . Unfortunately , the aggressors were never adequately punished , and the most corrosive consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to President Eisenhower to negotiate  --  was that thenceforth it might be presumed the U.S. could be jockeyed into a war it lacked the will to win . And jockeyed it was , though by a far more protracted process than is generally understood , into America 's longest and most catastrophic war and the first it ever lost  --  the Vietnam War . U.S. involvement in that war began not with President Kennedy 's dispatch of U.S. combat troops to Vietnam in 1962 , nor with commitment of those troops to battle by President Johnson , but a full 20 years earlier when , under the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration , the war zones were established for the prosecution of World War II in the Pacific theater of operations . To comprehend the extraordinary short-sightedness of that expedient , with its ultimately calamitous consequences , it should be borne in mind that it was in the last year of Roosevelt 's second term in the presidency-1940that France , for nearly a century ruler of Indochina , was ignominiously defeated on her own home ground and capitulated to Adolf Hitler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the U.S. entry into World War II , therefore , and with full knowledge of a firmly established Roosevelt adminstration , France thus suffered a defeat almost unique in history  --  that of a colonial power brought to its knees at home and thereby losing control not only of its own destiny but that of its colonies as well . When has such a nation so defeated been able to regain its lost colonies ? Never in world annals . And that point should have been crystal clear to Roosevelt  --  doubly so to one with the international stature to which he pretended . Yet it was n't . It could n't have been . For he was content to let the whole of Indochina fall into the British-controlled Southeast Asia war zone . Thus he failed to grasp that his own country must be by far the dominant contributor to any victories won , either in the Pacific or Europe , and therefore would inevitably be involved  --  as it ultimately was with a vengeance  --  in the intensely difficult Indochinese settlement that must follow war 's end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and General Douglas MacArthur 's Southwest Pacific war zones ? It lay neatly along the Vietnamese coast . And thus the bulk of Indochina fell to British suzerainty ? not that of the U.S. ? on the Japanese collapse in 1945 . Was this a U.S.-British-French deal , a deal kept secret from the American people ? The record does not divulge . And silence on that crucial point without doubt provides the clue to why Americans became so deplorably divided , so distracted , so rudderless in their purposes when eventually they became enmeshed in the Vietnam War  --  a war they did n't understand , an " immoral war " that never should have come about but instead flickered ever hotter and hotter , a war whose ashes even now flame angrily like some persistent fire that refuses to be extinguished . Yes , the Vietnam War was immoral . It was immoral for exposing American servicemen to the unusual hazards of an undeclared , no-win war . It was immoral for its image of a giant nation mindlessly flailing an insignificant , far-away nation with no real understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that it need not even have come about but for the gross incompetence of U.S. foreign policy as far back as the Roosevelt era . Did that policy comprehend the long-manifest Indochinese nationalism  --  spearheaded by Ho Chi Minh 's Viet Minh movement  --  that burned to throw off French rule ? Did it grasp that , once defeated , France could never hope to regain its lost Indochinese possessions and had no business even trying ? Did it feel any obligation to reward an ally , the Viet Minh , for its anti-Japanese services in World War II  --  a concern promising much to the ultimate advancement of U.S. interests in Asia ? Obviously not . Instead , the first downhill step  --  resulting directly from those oddly drawn World War II combat zones  --  was for a self-sidelined U.S. to watch helplessly the disgraceful British rearming of Japanese prisoners in 1945 to bushwhack the newly proclaimed Viet Minh administration in Vietnam and to hold the territory open against the arrival of French military units . Next followed a senseless interlude during which France attempted the historically impossible  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dien Bien Phu , which led to the futile Geneva Accord creating North and South Vietnam and dividing them at the 17th parallel . And did the U.S. make any attempt to influence or even halt this stupidity ? Far from it . By 1950 the U.S. was underwriting France 's military effort in Vietnam to the tune of $150 million , an outlay which was to grow to more than $1 billion-80 percent of the French costs  --  in 1954 , the year of Dien Bien Phu . Unbelievable ? But that was barely a beginning . The time came when the U.S. , with one tentative toe in the Vietnam quagmire , got sucked in over head and ears . From cadres of military advisers to South Vietnam in the Truman-Eisenhower years , the U.S. presence grew to the Kennedy-dispatched contingent of some16,000 combat troops ; a year later President Johnson ordered those troops into battle . There followed the mad Tonkin Gulf frolic and  --  presto ! the U.S. was committed to a full-fledged war ultimately involving a half-million-man army equipped with every sort of sophisticated weaponry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. could n't win . And lacking the will to win , it eventually lost . Were the North Vietnamese the enemy , the Viet Cong  --  who ? Why was the U.S. in Vietnam at all ? How did it get there ? What were its aims ? Babbitt-like reasons were tossed back and forth . But the American people were n't convinced . Ignorant of the long-festering reasons for their country 's plight , they swayed this way and that . In the end enough of them screamed " end the war " so tumultuously that Johnson felt himself barred from the second presidential term he might have sought . So once again it fell to a Republican president to unscramble a military mess . Elected Johnson 's successor in 1968 , President Nixon promised to - wind down " the war . He tried . He managed to cut the U.S. military presence to some 25,000 . Aided by Henry Kissinger , his secretary of state , he contrived the fragile Paris peace agreement of 1973 . But his " Vietnamization " program was systematically scuttled by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon than he faced the final calamity of America 's ill-starred Indochinese adventure . The North Vietnamese  --  descendants of Ho Chi Minh 's Viet Minh , but now bitter enemies of the U.S. ? swarmed across the 1973 cease-fire line , overran South Vietnam and left the remaining Americans no choice but to flee , their shirttails flying , any way they could . That is the war-prone record of this century 's Democratic presidents  --  save only Mr. Carter . And out of concern for future generations of Americans , it would surely seem vital to look for anything that may have united these presidents in a kind of affinity for war , though certainly none wished for war . The unifying thread most apparent is that all shared the belief  --  now virtually Democratic dogma  --  that government should play an activist role in the lives and doings of the American people . Truman carried this concept to its logical conclusion in calling his party " the party of the people , " while Roosevelt 's New Deal , though failing in its goal of fighting the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important concern of that same horrifying draft in the same nether region . Bending over to pick up my tee confirmed my worst fears  --  zipper again clear down to the floor boards . As a result , that shot into the woods proved to be my best effort of the game . You may not know this , but trying to keep the right elbow over the fly can raise all kinds of hell with the swing . Especially when one is preoccupied with the thought of his " buddies " stooping so low as to bribe his wife to tamper with his zipper . As I said , that 's it . I 'll never play another round with those guys  --  never , And I mean it . Of course , this is only Monday . And I have until Wednesday . I wonder if I could hire a girl with a corduroy bikini and a permanent case of hiccups to kibitz when Stan ... hum .... IV War Party continued from page 46 activist government in ac removed in time from today 's Democratic era  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress ? Wilson nonetheless showed himself a people 's man . And it was a wealthy liberal , Kennedy , who hustled his favorites , " the best and the brightest , " to construct a European-style welfare state which Johnson , with a surer hand on Congress , brought to being under his grandiloquently named Great Society . But as history has shown of all such people-serving schemes , the cost was enormous . Roosevelt 's New Deal , Truman 's Fair Deal , Kennedy 's New Frontier , Johnson 's Great Society  --  all cost the government far in excess of its revenues . Yet because these schemes were politically expedient , a whipping boy had to be found . It was not the social programs of a benevolent government that caused the red-ink spending , it was said ; it was the exorbitant cost of nation al defense . Defense was the bugaboo . Especially to blame were the demands of the military and their suppliers , the despised military-industrial complex . Thus there has been an almost continuous tug of war between the monetary demands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too often it has been the latter  --  at the hands of vote-conscious politicians  --  that have taken the cuts . The consequence is that U.S. defenses have been negligently depleted in the sense that the ultimate well-being of the American people depends on the nation 's capacity not only to repulse its enemies but also to muster military might awesome enough to stamp out wars before they begin . " The moving finger writes , " and one thing it has written is that America 's wars in this century have followed a downhill path . Though immensely costly , World Wars I and II were clear-cut victories . The Korean War at least restored the boundary between North and South Korea . But the Vietnam War can be classed only as a clear-cut defeat in which 50,000 Americans died merely to herald the coming of the pathetic Vietnamese " boat people . " Could a future war replace the famous " weeping Frenchman " ? overcome at France 's ignominious defeat in 1940 ? with some nameless American in tears at the forced surrender of his country to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perish the thought . To render such an outrageous event no more than a nightmare 's conjuring , however , the time has come for the American people to demand that henceforth America 's military might and productive power be the means to rid the world of war . It must be made clear to the world that America will make the cost of war insupportable .
