 | Dorothy Thompson first learned in 1946 that she was a victim of discrimination . At the time she was working at the Kingsport Press in Kingsport , Tenn. , one of the largest book binderies in the country . She operated the two large sewing machines used to sew together the pages of a book , and she had to keep the " hoppers " that automatically fed the book sections into her machines full and make sure that each machine ran smoothly . The job was known as " double duty " in the bindery , and workers who did it got a bonus . Dorothy 's bonus was three cents an hour . Across the aisle a young man also worked two sewing machines ? smaller than Dorothy 's . When Dorothy found out that the young man was receiving both higher regular pay than she was and a higher bonus ( 15 cents an hour ) , she was outraged . She became even angrier when she complained to her union shop steward about the difference ( both Dorothy and the young man belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained that Dorothy 's pay was lower because " she was a woman . " " I knew there was nothing I could do about the injustice then , " Dorothy reminisces . " There was no law . So I just stored it away in the back of my mind and thought , One day I 'll make it right . ' " It took Dorothy Thompson 36 years to make it right , but in April 1982 she won a landmark $14,000,000 victory in the fight for equal pay , not just for herself , but for all women . Dorothy Thompson was born and raised in Gate City , Va. , a small town near the Tennessee border . Her father , a railroad man , was home only on weekends , and so it was her mother who ran the family . " She 's a very strong person , " says Dorothy , " and I guess that mode : took on me . " In 1941 , when Dorothy was 18 , she married her high school sweetheart . The following year her daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage was troubled almost from the beginning , and the couple separated when Dorothy was pregnant with her second child . As soon as her son was born , Dorothy got a divorce . She had to take care of the two babies herself because her husband moved out of state to avoid supporting them . So Dorothy moved back home with her parents and got a job at the Kingsport bindery . It was not an easy life . And it got much harder when , at age 5 , Sandy became seriously ill . Dorothy and her mother  | rushed the little girl to the doctor . " I almost sank through the floor when we learned what was wrong , " Dorothy recalls . " It was what we most dreaded ? polio . " The polio left Sandy with one leg shorter than the other , and as a result , she at first had to wear a brace , then built-up shoes . In order to spend more time with her children , Dorothy began to work nights . She would come off her shift at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cooking or cleaning , get the kids off to school , and then collapse into bed for a few hours of sleep before the children came home again . When Sandy was 13 , the doctors began some corrective surgery , a series of five operations on her leg . " None of it ever stopped her , " says her mother proudly . " She was a cheerleader all through high school . " Nothing stopped Dorothy either . Used to meeting challenges all her life , it was natural that she go on doing so ? even when it meant taking on the U.S. government . Dorothy moved to the Washington , D.C. , area and applied for a job at the Government Printing Office in 1965 . When she was hired , she really expected that " things would be different there . " No more , she thought , would the women be paid less than men or segregated into the lowest-paying jobs and blocked from the better-paying ones reserved for men . Dorothy had read the Equal Pay Act when it had passed in 1963 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried it around with her . What she did n't realize was at that time federal employees were exempt from the act . To her dismay Dorothy soon faced many of the discrimination problems she 'd encountered before . It was easy for Dorothy to keep track of the antidiscrimination laws being passed in the 1960s because the GPO prints every bit of government business . What Dorothy did n't know was how to make those laws work for herself and the other " bindery girls . " When she talked about equal pay to union representatives and supervisory personnel , she always heard the same thing : " It 'll never happen . " " Even the women said it ! " Dorothy cries indignantly . " They were their own worst enemies . " But Dorothy was determined to change things . Her first real chance came in 1971 , six years after she began to work at the GPO , when the government offered to train interested employees as Equal Employment Opportunity ( EEO ) counselors in all its agencies and departments . Dorothy was accepted for training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she applied for and got a part-time job as an EEO counselor at the Government Printing Office . " My supervisor gave me a good recommendation , " Dorothy jokes . " He thought he 'd get rid of me that way . " Two years later , in her capacity as EEO counselor , she accompanied a fellow employee who had a legal problem to the Washington Lawyers Committee , a group of attorneys who took on worthwhile cases . It turned out to be the most important errand Dorothy Thompson ever ran . While there , she told the lawyers about conditions for women at the GPO and her fight to change them . They suggested she contact an attorney named Nora Bailey , who wanted to give some of her time to a case that would help women . No stranger to self-reliance and determination , Nora had worked her way through college and law school . Her background played an important part in her interest in the GPO case : She understood how tough it is for people who do n't know the ropes to fight for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expertise she needed to continue her fight . But it was still not easy to convince the other women sewing-machine operators at the GPO to join her in going to court and suing the government . Although Dorothy could have initiated the class action herself , Nora thought the case would be stronger if other women joined the suit . Then technology came to Dorothy 's aid . In 1973 the GPO began using a new machine , called the perfect binder , that glues books together instead of stitching them . It was stipulated that only men trained on the new machines through an apprenticeship program would be allowed to run them . Some of the women , realizing their jobs as sewing-machine operators could soon become obsolete , became uneasy . Four women came to Dorothy and at last agreed to sign a discrimination complaint against the government . In May 1973 Nora Bailey filed a class-action suit against the GPO on behalf of 325 female bindery workers . At that point Nora thought that the GPO was in such obvious violation of the discrimination laws that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set things right . After all , she reasoned , here was a group of women sewing-machine operators doing essentially the same work as men , yet blocked from the " male " jobs by a four-year apprenticeship requirement ( frequently waived for men ) , unable to move into supervisory positions because they were not permitted to take the exams for them , and members of a union that maintained separate locals for men and women and that had a clause in its constitution specifically barring women from the " male " jobs . But the government decided to fight the case on the grounds that previous discrimination suits had involved workers using exactly the same machines . Since in this case the women were forced to use different machines ? even though the work was equivalent ? the GPO tried to prove there were no violations under the Equal Pay Act . The battle lines were drawn . And from the day the suit was filed , Dorothy 's life at the bindery became a nightmare . Her supervisors , trying to show the women " what happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra " jobs . ( It was general practice in the bindery that whenever there was not enough sewing-machine work , the women were sent to other jobs . ) One day when Dorothy was sent to work on the assembly line , men on the line kept increasing their pace but Dorothy kept up despite the jeers of some male workers . " I did it long enough to show them I could handle it , " Dorothy said . Then a friend advised her to complain . She did , and though the heavy work stopped , the verbal abuse continued . Dorothy understood that her bosses were trying to isolate her and turn the other women against her , so she tried to ignore the insults . But she could n't ignore a supervisor who routinely referred to her as " that damn Tennessee woman . " Dorothy took her complaint to Senator Howard Baker 's office , where she met with an aide and described the harassment . As a result , Senator Baker sent a letter to the brass at the GPO , Dorothy 's boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her " that damn Tennessee woman " again . " To have a case against the government , " Dorothy declares , " you 've got to show them you 're a fighter . " Dorothy and the other women involved in the suit needed that kind of determination . Their case did not come to trial until 1978 , five years after the suit was filed , as both sides kept going back to court with motions and counter-motions . Then , the judge who 'd been hearing the case died , so in the spring of 1979 the trial had to start all over again in front of Judge Charles R. Richey . Dorothy was an important witness . She was nervous at first , but remembering her attorney 's advice to simply tell the truth , she gained more confi-  | dence as her testimony progressed . Even after the trial was over , the long period of waiting continued . But one day , in the fall of 1979 , a jubilant Nora Bailey called Dorothy at work : The women had won , and won big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was overjoyed . Judge Richey found that the GPO 's separate classification system for men and women perpetuated past discrimination and was not justified for business purposes or any other reason . He ruled that there was an equal-pay violation regarding Dorothy 's job and those of 36 other sewing-machine operators . This group was awarded $3.8 million in back pay . Dorothy 's share , after taxes , came to $112,484.39 ! Judge Richey also found that the entire " class " of 325 women working at the GPO had been discriminated against under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act . Therefore , he gave the women access to the formerly " male " jobs under a complex formula that allowed women a disproportionate number of positions until a 50-50 ratio between the sexes was achieved . He also eliminated the four-year-apprenticeship requirement , opened training programs to women , and allowed them to apply for supervisory jobs . All told , the settlement in the GPO case comes to over $14 million exclusive of legal fees , which may add another $2 to $3 million to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. government . But even as Dorothy and the other bindery women were celebrating their victory , another stumbling block was put in their path . The government decided to appeal the decision . As a result , all money and training opportunities were suspended until the appeal was decided . Another three long years dragged by . Many of the women became discouraged , particularly those who , like Dorothy , were in their fifties . If they did not get training and better jobs soon , it would be too late . The day of the appeal finally arrived in September 1981 . Dorothy and the four other women who had signed the complaint nervously went to court to hear arguments of the government lawyers . Then the waiting began all over again . But in April 1982 the appeals court upheld Judge Richey 's decision in its entirety ! And in July the government announced it would appeal the case no further . The long haul was finally over . The women had truly won . It had taken nine long years ( enough time , Nora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have two sons , renovate an old house , and become a partner in her law firm ) . But they had won . For Dorothy the best part of her victory was not the $14,000,000 , but the formal acknowledgement that she was right . She is now treated with respect at the GPO . She was also among the first group of women to be promoted to a supervisory job . But the promotion does have its " raw side " ; she was the only one who had to leave the book section to be promoted ? the agency 's way of getting even , she believes . Although her current job in the passport section is a good one , paying twice her old salary , Dorothy is determined to return to her old section . This is one of the many items still being negotiated . Dorothy 's lawsuit is a landmark in many ways : in the amount of money involved , the implications for the entire printing industry , and its broadening of the Equal Pay Act to include workers doing equivalent work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete change in management and attitude at the GPO . Immediately following the appeals-court decision , Public Printer Danford L. Sawyer , the agency 's chief executive officer , issued a statement committing the agency to " equality of opportunity for all GPO employees . " The agency and the Justice Department are moving ahead quickly to implement the court decision . The union has also had to " clean up its act . " Now part of the Graphic Arts International Union , it finally merged the male and female locals in 1981 . But perhaps the most important benefit of this long struggle is the change in the way the women feel about themselves . Resignation has given way to optimism . The younger women know that they are no longer trapped in deadend jobs , that they can earn far greater salaries as they move up the ladder . The veterans have either received their lump-sum payments or will shortly . All can look forward to larger pensions . As for Nora Bailey , who has put 4,500 unpaid hours into this case so far , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social justice has proved that the law does , in the last analysis , protect those who have been wronged . Even the government can not stand above it . And Dorothy Thompson ? She is thinking about retiring in a few years to the cottage she has bought in Georgia , near her son 's family , and the book she will one day write . But before that there is the unfinished business of her job . Asked if she thinks she 'll get back to the book section , Dorothy smiles broadly , her eyes lighting up with a trace of fire . " The judge said we 're to have our rightful place , " she declares . And there is no question she 'll keep fighting until she does .
