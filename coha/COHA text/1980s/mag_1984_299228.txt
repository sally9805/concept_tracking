Grace and Zoeller win the towel wavers ' U.S. Open <P> The shot making at Winged Foot last week was only remarkable , the towel waving memorable . Fuzzy Zoeller signaled mock surrender to Greg Norman at the fieriest moment of a U.S. Open Sunday , and when the heat was off in their 18-hole playoff the following day , Norman waved back . Golf may be " a rude game , " as Zoeller says , but golfers almost unfailingly display a grace under pressure that used to be the definition of heroism . From Yankee Stadium to Wimbledon , the phrase has pretty much abandoned sport . <P> This is not to say that very many have the temperament of Frank Urban Zoeller , 32 , who whistles while he plays . Or that an eight-stroke drubbing was casually accepted by Norman , 29 , a hatchet-faced Australian able to hit the ball prodigious distances in unpredictable directions . " I needed something special . It never happened , " he said after the playoff . " I feel disappointed and hollow . " While it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make yesterday 's victory seem meaningless , neither a 160-yd. , 6-iron shot into the 18th grandstand nor a 40-ft. putt into the 72nd hole will ever leave Norman completely . <P> Zoeller is right about the game 's impolite tendencies . Ten years ago , venerable Winged Foot in Mamaroneck , N.Y. , was outfitted by the United States Golf Association as retaliation for Johnny Miller 's final 63 in the previous Open . To charges that at times they have attempted to mortify the world 's greatest golfer , U.S.G.A. officials always answer no , they were only trying to identify him , never explaining how they might happen to identify him as Orville Moody or Andy North . <P> In 1974 Hale Irwin neglected to break par 70 on any of the four days , but his seven-over-par score won the tournament by two shots . This year , when agronomists left the course relatively alone , Irwin led with three sub-par rounds before collapsing spectacularly under the combined weight of Winged Foot 's patient vengeance and a second straight day of Zoeller 's rollicking gallery . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed anywhere . Before the playoff , Zoeller said , " I kept hearing people say , ' Do n't let the money out of the country . ' Hell , it 's only going to Orlando . " Norman recently moved there . <P> Making a 68-ft. putt without trying to , Zoeller took a three-stroke lead on the second hole . Norman three-putted three of the first five , and the most meaningful championship in golf turned into a brisk 3-hr. 15-min. walk . When Zoeller missed a birdie putt near the close of his handsome 67 , Norman in jest made the sort of choking sign that professional basketball players flash to each other in earnest . Then he went to his own ball . " Knock it in , " Fuzzy said softly .
