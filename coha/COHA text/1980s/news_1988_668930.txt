For the most part , the fans here knew just when to cheer , when to roar and even when to raise their arms for that disgusting American creation , the Wave . A Swedish public address announcer enlightened the noveau National Football League fans with explanations of the game as the plays unfolded . Now , if only the Bears ' defense had been prompted to do its part Sunday , the Minnesota Vikings might not have passed for 291 yards and three touchdowns in a 28-21 exhibition victory in the rain at Ullevi Stadium . A crowd of 33 , 115 fans bearing signs , placards and broad smiles seemed thoroughly entertained by the histrionics displayed by these NFC Central Division rivals . " Are all the American football games like this one ? " asked one spirited Swedish fan as he departed the stadium . " This was the first football game I ' ve ever seen . It was . . . different . " For fans accustomed to counting up the score on one foot in their 52 , 000- seat soccer stadium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional coaches ' spiel that this was only an exhibition game , Mike Ditka expressed some concern about the Bear defense ' s recent inability to stop opponents . " Right now , we need our defensive unit to carry us a little bit better , " said Ditka , whose club fell to 1-1 in preseason action . " You can slough it off any way you want to , but eventually you ' ve got to stop sloughing it off , because you ' ve got to play . " But I ' m totally optimistic . There ' s nothing negative about the game except that we ' ve just got to get some turnovers . I mean , we ' ve got to start thinking that way and talking that way and playing that way . And then , hopefully , some of those balls that are bouncing off our hands will bounce in our hands . We ' ve gone two games now and we have not created a turnover . " The Bears , who have allowed 45 points in the two preseason games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then will resume two-a-day practices . They face the Dallas Cowboys in Irving , Tex. , next Monday night . There were enough encouraging signs on the offense to keep Ditka upbeat . All three quarterbacks who played-Jim McMahon ( 3 for 3 for 16 yards ) , Mike Tomczak ( 9 for 13 , 119 yards , 1 TD , 1 interception ) and Jim Harbaugh ( 4 for 5 , 78 yards ) - performed well . " I thought Mike played well , " said Ditka . " The interception was not a bad throw . It was a good throw , a good choice . " Veteran fullback Matt Suhey carried three times for 28 yards . Rookie wide receiver Wendell Davis caught two passes for 53 . And rookie tailback Eric Starr ( 3 carries for 18 yards , 1 kickoff return for 41 ) continued to look impressive . Minnesota ( 1-1 ) moved 74 yards on the first possession of the game to take a 7-0 lead . Quarterback Tommy Kramer ( 6 for 8 , 147 yards , 1 TD ) passed 23 yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordan for the key plays . D.J. Dozier , who rushed for 12 yards on the drive , capped it with a 1- yard scoring plunge . He later injured a hip and left the game on a stretcher , but X-rays were negative . The Bears tied the game on Neal Anderson ' s 19-yard run that capped a 65- yard drive . Suhey had 28 yards rushing on the drive , and McMahon had completions of seven yards to Dennis McKinnon and five to tight end Emery Moorehead . Anderson was sprung loose on the right side by a crunching block from guard Mark Bortz . Kevin Butler converted to make it 7-7 with 3 : 34 left in the first quarter . " I don ' t know if I buried him , but it was ( safety ) Joey Browner I blocked , " said Bortz . " Neal did the right thing . He kind of waited for the guy to make the wrong move . Neal slowed down a little bit to wait for the block , and I got it . " The Vikings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Kramer to Anthony Carter with 7 : 48 left in the half . Chuck Nelson ' s extra-point attempt was partially blocked but still dropped over the crossbar . Carter , who has made a habit of raiding the Bears ' secondary , finished with three catches for 98 yards . Last December , he caught three for 106 yards and two TDs against the Bears . Tomczak , who took over for McMahon in the second quarter , passed 21 yards to a wide-open Dennis Gentry for another tie . Wade Wilson ( 11 for 14 , 152 yards , 2 TDs ) then hit Hassan Jones over the middle for a 30-yard score with 7 : 36 to go in the third period . Jones made a diving catch in the end zone , and Nelson ' s conversion put the Vikings on top 21-14 . The Bears answered with a scoring drive that featured a 34-yard pass from Tomczak to Davis and runs of 11 and 7 yards by Starr . No. 1 draft pick Brad Muster ( 10 carries for 11 yards ) plunged across from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter . Free-agent kicker Tim Lashar converted to make it 21-21 . The winning score came on Wilson ' s 4-yard pass to Reggie Ward with 13 : 32 to go in the game . The Bears drove for a possible tying TD , propelled by a 39-yard pass from Harbaugh to Glen Kozlowski . But Muster ' s dive on fourth and 2 deep in Viking territory was stopped cold with 2 : 03 left . " The last call was really my fault , " said Ditka . " We thought it was less than a yard to go , and it was more like two yards . We can ' t expect to push them back that far in that kind of defense . So it wasn ' t a good call .
