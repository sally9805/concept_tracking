After five years , an exit visa <P> At the time , many saw it as a desperate , probably futile gamble . Seven Pentecostals from Siberia raced past startled Soviet guards and into the U.S. embassy in Moscow . Their aim : to win permission to leave a country that , they said , persecuted members of their religious minority ( estimated size : at least 150,000 ) . The fugitives were given a single 12-ft. - by- 20- ft. room in the embassy basement and later took over the barbershop next door . Last week , after nearly five years in their refuge , the Siberian Seven , as they have become known , finally moved a little closer to freedom when Soviet authorities allowed one of them , Lidiya Vashchenko , 32 , to board an Austrian Airlines flight to Vienna . <P> Vashchenko 's family has been at odds with the Soviet government for 20 years . Then particular Pentecostal practices forbid them to serve in the army , while their devoutness prompted them to withdraw their children from atheistic state schooling . Moreover , ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. embassy , the conflict has become more complicated . The Soviets promised to consider their visa applications only if all seven returned to their native city of Chernogorsk in southern Siberia and applied through normal channels . Fearing reprisals , the seven had steadfastly refused to leave the embassy . <P> In January 1982 , however , Vashchenko and her more robust mother Augustina , 53 , began a hunger strike . After a month Lidiya , whose weight had dropped to 84 Ibs. , became so weak that she agreed to be taken to Moscow 's Botkin Hospital and nursed back to health . Two weeks later , she returned to Chernogorsk . There , determined to test the government 's promise , she applied to the local authorities for permission to leave . <P> Last month the government abruptly granted her request , stipulating only that she move either to Israel or West Germany . " We have always believed God was calling us to go to Israel , " said a smiling Vashchenko upon arriving in Vienna , before flying from there to Israel . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move signaled any change in government attitudes . For their part , the Vashchenkos stubbornly demanded that eleven relatives back in Siberia also be allowed to emigrate . Meanwhile , the U.S. embassy has reassured the six that it will extend its hospitality indefinitely .
