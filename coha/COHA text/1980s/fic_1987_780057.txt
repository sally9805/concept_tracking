 | He snapped into a salute , and I gave him one back just to be friendly . " What 's the fuss ? " he said , like a stranger at an accident . " Well ? " I went round behind the shielding with him as I explained , so he could crack his helmet enough to get about eighteen ounces of water into him . Thirstiest human being I 'd ever met , off a desert world . He kept drinking until I was through . " I 'll take over , then , " he said . " I suppose I 'll be all right . " " As all right as any male , around here , " I told him . " But if the stuff does get you  --  try to find somebody new . That Clifford gal may have had enough for one shift .

Not that I got a chance to scamper on back to the playroom . The Plant Superintendent  --  a title that means very little on some worlds , but in our bubble translated to God Almighty 's Slightly Younger Sibling  --  lifted a finger at me as the hearing broke up , and I nodded and stayed around while the rest filed out  --  Harper , a four-woman jury , and a Superintending Psychologist named Silard . When we were alone , the Super ( her name was King  --  a title that will pry loose all sorts of respect on most of the worlds where Plant Superintendent wo n't buy a cup of coffee ) leaned across her desk and said : " Well there , Knave : whadda we do now ? Sorry about that . Translation slipped for a second . " We go back to work , " I said in my best Standard . " What the Hell else can we do ? " " I have no idea , " she ( more or less ) said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here two weeks . You 've called for six hearings , and been party to four others . You 've seen everything there is to see . What 's our answer ? " I just looked at her . " What 's the question ? " She sighed deeply . Displaying great patience , I suppose . " We ca n't go on like this , " she said . " The men are falling apart . We 've got to stay shut in  --  this has to remain a secret . And there 's no such thing as a perfect seal , not for something that can be effective in individual-molecule strength . As long as we do stay shut in ? " " The attacks will go on , " I said . " But secrecy is n't the problem . If this whole operation were displayed on constant 3V , the attacks would still go on . " " I suppose so , " she said . " But we 've got to find a way to keep the men working , to keep everyone from cracking ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months we need . " There is always another fact hidden in the dust somewhere , and I do like to dig those oddities out and polish them , but the odds are enormous that none of them will do you any good . And I had been there long enough to see ( nearly ) everything there was to see . Therefore , I did not suggest : ( a ) Psychological testing of male staff . It had been tried , it was still being tried ; but the damned pheromones did n't worry about psychology : if you were male , you were doomed . ( b ) hiring only chemical engineers with weak sex drives , effectively nonexistent sex drives , or sex drives aimed at the male , instead of the female , half of the human race . That had been tried , too ; for results , see ( a ) . ( c ) Hiring only female chemical engineers . . . And that , of course , was the logical , easy solution . King had gone just as far as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of chemical engineers were male  --  on Ansonia  --  or near enough . That sort of  | statistic changes from planet to planet and from generation to generation ; for the moment , we were stuck with the bad news . King had hired very nearly every female chemical engineer on the planet  --  in our bubble , there were nearly 70 per cent female staff in risk jobs  --  and there had n't been enough . If he 'd been able to hire from both sides in the Robertan war .. . But then he would n't have needed the Karst discovery at all . I suggested hiring more offplanet engineers  --  female . " Sure , " King said . " And have Ansonia itself wonder why I 'm bringing in engineers from Rasmussen , say  --  or Earth , for that matter . " " There might be some way to do it quietly , " I said . " So there might , " she said . " I know you were hired by tight beam . If there were a way of sending a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ship could manage that . I so stated . For about three seconds I basked in the respect of God Almighty 's Slightly Younger Sib . I may be the only civilian with full space-four capability ( extracted from a grateful ? when suitably reminded  --  Comity ) . But the respect died quickly . " And , " she went on , " if there were a way to land them here with the same lack of notice . " That would have required several sorts of invisibility ray . The things are so damned popular on 3V , I wish they existed out here where people could grab onto them . " All right , " I said . " But there has to be a way ? " " Does there ? " she said bleakly . " Well ? " I blinked . " Look : how about arranging shifts so that only women are on at one time , only men at an-other ? " " I 've been trying to do that from the start , " she said .  | " But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might . But you 're assigned , right now , to a shift and location as thoroughly male as any . " " I do n't suppose you could persuade the female engineers that an attack now and then was a sort of  --  occupational hazard ? " She just stared at me . " I might , " she said . " But  --  well , Harper wo n't be back on duty for two of his shifts . He 'll go down to Recreation to get drunk  --  and perhaps find a slightly more willing partner . And at that , he 'll recover more quickly than most . You see , Knave , the occupational hazard comes in two parts : the women get attacked , and the men lose all interest in anything but the women . " Harper had at least turned pugnacious when I 'd stopped him ; but the correction was n't worth making . That temporary extra area of interest was no help at all . No more help , in fact , than I was . King said , again : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not well at all . " Three days passed . Three long , trouble-loaded days . I have no excuse . It 's perfectly true , though , that you can get too close to a situation to get a decent look at it ? but , on the other hand , a decent look was n't quite what this particular situation seemed to need . An indecent look , now . . . Those three days involved fifteen attacks . The fourteenth involved Harper again : it seemed everyone had overestimated his capacity for resisting , or just wearing out , the bypass effect . We were all thankful ( Clifford not least ) that the target of his latest launch happened to be a gal named Hardesty  --  and , frankly , if he 'd asked for a hearing , I 'd have been tempted to put him right back on the line , as being a little precipitate , maybe , but fundamentally perfectly normal . Hardesty was a gal of remark14 Knave &; the Game able specs , a first-generation Robertan colonist from the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of as the Menace from Earth . The bypass effect could have aimed Harper at any female in the bubble ; but aiming for Hardesty scarcely required any novel chemistries . In less demanding circumstances , I might have made a quiet pass or two myself , despite the fact that she was married ( her husband was an engineer as good as she was , on a different shift ) . I do have something of a rule against tampering with the truly married ; but I 'm not , as they say , fanatic about it . Harper , though , was only a passing irritation . The fifteenth attack was the charm , and that one belonged to Valentine Smith , who was certainly living up to his odd name . When a tough gal named Friday ( so help me ; and Roberta did n't even own Comity names for its weekdays ) put in a complaint , King ( and Pinero , and Karst ) discovered that she was the fourth gal our Valentine had used his little arrow on , that morning . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect made no distinction between woman A and woman X  --  and that every female in the bubble knew this rather degrading fact  --  Valentine must sure as Hell have had something special . I made a note to ask him whether it was teachable , once we got clear of our problem . After all , a Survivor has to go after every available sort of fact  --  right ? It was Friday 's complaint that finally kicked my brain into doing some work , though . Her description of the attack , in fact : " He came at me , and there must have been ten other men in the area . Ten . And not one of them made a move to help me . I can take care of myself , sure  --  but not one of them made a move of any kind , except to get on with their  | work . Ten other men , and I might just as well have been alone . If you think I 'm going to stand for ? " The other men , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they had mixed in , on any side and to any degree , the least trace of the pheromone bypass  --  if any happened to be in their systems , and nobody really wanted to quote odds on that  --  would have set them off : we might truly have had a busy Friday , so to speak , with men fighting over her , maybe calming down just enough to get in line and wait their turns .. . It 's called momentum , and it 's a powerful force : ask Isaac Newton ( or Sigmund Freud ) . Ignoring the attack was the best insurance those ten men could buy against suddenly joining it . But explaining that to a flaming-mad Friday would have been useless . She was in no better shape to appreciate sense than I would have been , maybe ten minutes postattack . So none of us did explain it to her  --  not more than two or three times apiece . And she went off with steam still coming out of her head , and threatening to quit , and promising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this impossible situation , and  --  so on . So I did something . By midafternoon I was alone , lying on my solitary cot in my solitary cubicle , and I kept thinking about those ten men . Ten men . Ten little Indians . And what made them worth thinking about ? The back of my head is a good deal brighter than the front of my head . It wanted me to go on thinking about those men , so I was more than willing to oblige it . I was even willing to try asking it questions . 1 . Would they be worth thinking about if they were nine men , or  | eleven , or seventy-six ? ( The back of my head has a high signal-to-noise ratio , but I thought I heard it say Yes. ) 2 . Should they have been doing something other than ignoring the attack ? ( No , under no circumstances  --  which was so very positive a reply I filed it for further mulling. ) 3 . Did the identity of the men make any difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( Of course not ; the bypass made any male grab blindly for any available female . Which also seemed suddenly important . ) I think I got all the way to 22 , and most of the list was too silly to record . But my head  --  after a while , front and back both  --  kept coming back to 2 and 3 : something kept whispering Any male . . . any female . It was three o'clock in the morning , bubble time , when those words began to mean something . I sat bolt upright in my bunk , catching myself a nasty bruise on the overhead shelving , and cursed myself for several different sorts of idiot , including two or three sorts I had never really thought of before . Then I reached for the local phone and began buzzing for a meeting of the minds . The three who counted : Karst , Pinero , King . And , of course , the Man with the Answer : Gerald Knave : Idiot Everybody looked a trifle seedy , but no more tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry , they 'd been cramming approximately twenty-five hours into every twenty-four , from the beginning . And they babbled at me  --  for almost a minute . Questions , all at once , and ( therefore ) unintelligible . I raised a hand . Silence came down into Pinero 's office like a pure-gold blanket ( we were meeting there because it was handy , and fairly large ) . Power , it 's wonderful . I made just two recommendations . The first was :  | " You 've got to hire a lot more men to work as chemical engineers up here . " The reaction was predictable . I was crazy . I 'd gone completely round the bend ( which is easy in a small bubble ) . Did n't I realize that I 'd be wishing on every woman in the bubble a larger mob of potential rapists to fight off ? How could I even think of such a thing .. . And on , and on . I waited it out for a bit , just to see whether anybody was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really doubt my answer . It was too good . And when I 'd collected a bucketful of assorted querulousness and invective , I raised my hand again . So much for the joys of power : it did n't work . I stood on a chair , put my hand up again , and said loudly : " All right . Now listen to the rest of it . " Then , in silence , I gave them my second recommendation . " Segregate the women . Entirely . " Somebody  --  Karst , I think  --  said : " But ? " and stopped . The three of them sat and thought  --  probably calling themselves a few of the simpler names I 'd been using on Gerald Knave : Moron , just a few hurried minutes before . Then , because there was no stupidity in that trio , they got to work  --  planning their new hiring methods . Somebody  --  I ca n't remember who , and it may not matter  --  once said that if a problem looks unsolvable , you can always try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may even have a solution . I had seen and heard enough about the women in that bubble being turned upside-down ; it still took me all that time to apply the technique to the bubble 's problem . And the solution was , of course , sitting around , waiting for us . Roberta had an imbalance of chemical engineers ? all of 79 per cent male ?  | In that case  --  why hire any women at all ? ( For office jobs  --  for planning and theory  --  for anything that did n't put them in contact with men  --  sure . Anything that left them out of contact every minute of every day . But not on the line . ) Men only . The bypass effect had no meaning without female pheromones ; and where there are no females , there are no female pheromones . ( That took a little working-out , what with cleaning the already-tainted air , and then setting up the universe 's most thorough air-conditioning plant . As long as women were in the bubble at all , pheromones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether men could reach the women or not , the bypass effect would have them massively interested in women and massively uninterested in anything else  --  and would lead , at the very least , to endless , crippling frustrations . The psychiatric workers did n't really need the extra load . As it turned out , a few cases did surface  --  but not very many : taking truly teeny chemical cues out of the air is not the sort of job you can make one hundred per cent effective . Separation was rigorous  --  Karst and King did their jobs by phone as far as all males were concerned , from Pinero down  --  and the air work was as good as possible  --  as good as several bright and dedicated engineers of both sexes , working of course on wholly separate shifts , could make it . ) Men only . We do n't seem to think that way , these years ; though women only is damned near to a standard , unquestionable piece of everybody 's head . Agreeing without thought to women only is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think , without unusual effort , in terms of men only is no better . I suppose all this will straighten out after a while  --  things do seem to , one way or another  --  but we have sure as Hell not got it straightened out yet .  | Men only  --  which is , almost all of the time , a fairly lousy , unproductive , curseworthy way to think . ( Just as bad , of course , as women only . ) But , once in a while . . . The bypass was stockpiled in sufficient quantities in just under two months . After which  --  neither of the armies or navies being segregated establishments  --  the Robertan civil war was over , and with startling speed . Establishing some sort of workable social structure ? and trying to figure out a way of compensating a large , rather novel class of war victims  --  took longer . But I understand the place is nice and peaceful now . I have n't been back . ( In fact , I never did set foot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the talk is that Karst is on the track of what amounts to an immunizing agent against the pheromone bypass . And I suppose the Surprise Gas that was released is long ago inoperative . . . I suppose . All right : it certainly is a great idea : an end to warfare that amounts to playing that ancient classic , the Lysistrata , backwards . A great discovery : certainly . One that will , of course , lead to the breaking-out of peace all over . No more wars .. . But . . . I seem to have this little voice in the back of my head lately , coming in nice and clear despite the awful signalto-noise ratio . And when I begin thinking about the backwards Lysistrata and the end of war . . . the little voice says , slowly and sort of sadly : " Friend Knave  --  are you sure ? "  | If anybody asks me which is my favorite Knave story , I will point to this one . It originally appeared in a computer magazine , which is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knave says , a dirty business . And sometimes a fairly funny one . THE WHEELBARROW THIEF This one , they told me , was my own affair . They were n't going to order me to dive in ; in point of strict legal fact , they could n't , which was the trouble , but they were n't even going to make a sound like an order . This was going to be my own free choice . They kept telling me things like that . Around the third or fourth interviewer I said I was perfectly willing to take the job , and the Comity had no business enacting noninterference laws in the first place . What the Comity needed , I said , was a nice , strong interference law . " But you do n't see the point , " the interviewer said  --  a thin , pale fellow named , I think , Sneff  --  all details of Comity personnel have been changed to protect the helpless . Maybe he was a short fat woman named Remmenstein . " I see the point , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fair chance of getting myself killed or scrambled , because the Comity has no legal right to interfere in the affairs of sovereign planets . Under the circumstances , what would you expect me to think of that law ? Cheers and ap-plause ? " " Well , " he said nervously . I 'll stick to that on oath ; he was nervous . They all are , all the time . God alone knows what may be happening to the Pending file while they 're away talking to me.  | " Exactly , " I said . " But the Comity worlds  --  the home worlds  --  have no chance of imposing their own ideas of government on planets hundreds of light-years away ? " " They have n't ? " I said . " Then what have we been talking about ? " " I mean legally , " he said , as if it made a difference . Maybe it does . " Legally , Superior General Stern has no more right to our support than Minister Anthetor , and no less . Legally , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested me , but not very much . The position I wanted to know about was mine . On the spot , in the decided interests and support of Minister Anthetor . Damned if I know why . I had never met him , and I had been on Pupil III exactly once before in my life  --  for fortyfive minutes , waiting for a twister repair . Sometimes I puzzle the Hell out of myself . My identity card read , as usual , Gerald Knave : Survivor . There is not much sense in trying to disguise yourself on a planet full of human beings five feet tall and under  --  I 'm an even six  --  when you 've arrived with a civilian spacefour card reading : General , Unlimited . I may have the only one of those in existence . Every colonist gets a card good for one trip , one way , before he sets off .

It has few practitioners ?  | you have to start at the bottom , and the bottom is learning to survive , and many promising beginners do n't seem to ? and it is highly valued . I get a lot of government workplanet-testing , mostly . But this was something new . Everybody says espionage is a dirty business . Even spies say it . I have n't had a lot of experience with it  --  most of my time is spoken for , thank God  --  but I will agree that it is at least grimy as all Hell . There seems to be a lot of scuttling around in dark alleys in the job , and dropping to your hands and knees , and crawling zig-zag over this and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pupil III , not planning to need much  --  but most of what I did take I left there . There was absolutely no way of getting any of the stuff clean again . I landed  --  alone  --  at the main port , and flagged a Robbie to take my bags and such to the local version of splendid living . The city was named Arthur , which was rather nice , and it was a good long way from the battlefields . One of the things you tend to forget is that it is still possible to fight a war on only part of a planet . If , of course , you fight a limited one . That was what Stern and Anthetor were doing , I 'd been told ; and it meant that there was such a thing as prisoner exchange , among other niceties . I had been assured that , if captured , I would be exchanged . Of course , it might take a while . Or General Stern might change his mind . Well . . . I have never liked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exact opposite : it 's the risk you add on because you ca n't calculate it at all . That was the one I figured I was taking . I 'd landed in early afternoon , local time . Pupil III ( if you 've never heard of the place  --  lots of people have n't ? and the name is beginning to get to you , there is a constel- lation seen from Rigel and nearby that looks like an eye . Pupil is at the center of it ) ? has a twenty-five-hour day , which is close to Comity normal , and an Earth standard gravity of .91 , which tends to make you feel a little cheerful without knowing exactly why . What that does is make me feel suspicious . Until I thought of the gravity , and saw the connection . After that I began to relax a little . I spent some time sightseeing . Arthur has a tall tower or so , and a business district , but it goes in for sidewalk cafes . I drifted from cafe to cafe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coffee somewhere else ? never do that , by the way ; I never will again  --  and watching the passing crowd . I had on loose trousers and a baggy sort of colored shirt , and most of the men agreed with me . The women were jeweled and draped in fancy silks . If it had n't been for their faces they 'd have looked like walking store-windows . Waiters were polite to me  --  tourists usually tip well , and I had the carefully cultivated look of a VIP to top that off . I walked and hummed and sat and drank and watched , and around dinner-time I went on back to my charming little hostel  --  thirty stories high , and an average of three Bobbies , one human , per guest  --  and found the grill room . Despite unpleasant associations to the adjective , I ordered the finest dinner I could claw out of the menu , topped it off with real brandy ( Earth 2145 , and it got me even more respectful looks ) and toddled off to bed , every inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shall we ? After a while I was up and on my feet and more or less conscious , fed , dressed ? whatever . No sense delaying matters : I knew where the local rebel HQ was  --  that much was no secret  --  and I went over there . I did it very fancily . I hired a cab to drop me five squares  | away . I walked three squares , got into another cab , went four squares past the HQ  --  a dumpy building that looked like an architect 's rendering of a short fat woman named Remmenstein  --  and then walked back . I went around the block , and down an alley . At the end of all this foolishness , I was standing at the side of the building , peering into a dusty window . Nothing was visible inside . I sidled around toward the front to keep an eye on the entrance  --  who went in , who came out , that sort of thing . Broad daylight , but I did some of my sidling on hands and knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it right . A tall man with a mustache marched right by me . I saw him knock on the front door  --  two , three , one  --  and get invited in . Twenty minutes later nobody else had come by , except a few wanderers going somewhere else , so I went back to my viewless window . Now I saw shadows . One of them might have been the tall man . ( He was tall by Pupil III standards : maybe five three . For some reason , the planet seems to have been settled entirely by short people : five-three is almost unheard of . ) The other shadow was doing a lot of gesturing , I thought . I could n't hear anything , not even with my ear pressed right at the bottom of the window . I got some temporary dents in my face , but nothing more . Maybe the tall man was General Stem , head of the rebels . Maybe he was somebody else  --  almost anybody else . Lunch-time arrived . There were no local restaurants or cafes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd get a look at the delivery boy . Maybe they had their own kitchen . The man who came along was not a delivery boy . He  | was short and very , very wide , and he wore a white baggy shirt and white loose pants and a floppy white hat . I was back near the alley entrance in time to see the knock . Two , three , one . He went in . Then there was a rush of business : a pair of women who looked like twins , both redheads with unpleasant expressions that did n't much matter , the underlying faces being what they were ; a very small man with a cap and a large bulge in one pocket ; a man and a woman arriving together and arguing in gestures , no words , as they got to the door . I went back to my window . Time for the special effects . I set up the stethoscope at the extreme right bottom edge of the window . Maybe nobody would notice a black disk half an inch wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices . " The attack has to come within three days . We can not hold our positions any longer . " " But supplies must be sent ? " " Damn your supplies ! See to them : that 's your job . I tell you , Knessel is the key to the straits , and if we ca n't hold ? " " What does General Stern say ? " " Stern ? Stern is holding on . What can he say ? He has no more than three days . If we lose Knessel ? " " We can attack through the mountains . " " A typical civilian idea . Supply a mountain force ? when we have difficulties supplying Knessel , near the straits themselves ? " I could tell male from female .

" Male voice : " Are you threatening us all with execution ? Stern knows better ; who will he find to replace us ? He knows that we 're trustworthy  --  at least he ought to  --  but others might ?

I wondered what he looked like ; somehow or other , nobody had come up with visual files . Oh , well . " That much , we have always known  --  in our specialty . " I did n't like his laugh . Another male voice said : " The attack  --  let 's get back to the important issue . " " What I say ? " " What I say , " Carshin broke in , " is that we should hold our discussion for a bit . " His voice was , very suddenly , cautious . I snapped off the disk and stuffed the stethoscope in a pocket . I started out of the alley  --  toward the back this time  --  walking fairly fast , an innocent wanderer who 'd gotten a little lost , maybe .  | With dirty clothing .

It did clear , eventually  --  in about ten years . " If you put it that way , " I said , " Gerald Knave . " Carshin said : " And what do you ? " He was interrupted . There was a small knot of people away over at my left , whom I had n't had time for . Some I 'd seen before  --  one of the female twins , for instance ? others had apparently been in the place all along . It was the female twin who spoke up . I deduced at once that the other one was the girl behind me at the readout boards ; this one had the same voice . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough .

Follins : that would be the twin behind me , encephalography expert with a specialization in such advanced forms of detectors as the one I was in . Her twin was n't mentioned anywhere , which seemed unfair  --  after all , she 'd heard of me . Blounce : businessman . Pick the winner and ride all the way  --  that sort of man .

" Now , instead , tell me things . Tell me your exact assignment , to begin with . " Then he did smile . " Later , there will be other questions . " There were . I 'd made two bets , so to speak , and the first one came off nicely . Perhaps the Stern forces had some sort of dungeon inside the Arthur city limits , but they did n't put me in it . They just stocked me away in the cellar of their HQ ? behind a nice strong locked door , in a metal room with a ventilator at the top of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieved . That , of course , was some time after the questioning period . Carshin had gone on for a little over two hours , actual time . By my interior clock , about a hundred and fifty years . I had to keep up some resistance , after all . And that meant my head exploded every now and then . But I 'd broken down at last . I 'd told them I 'd been informed of the special meeting , and that the Anthetor people had guessed it would have to involve ways to hold Knessel and supply it . I 'd told them that my superior in the Anthetor Secret Service , a perfectly real person named Cecily Scriber , had given me the meeting as my first big job . " But spying is n't really my work , " I said . " Spying is for professional spies . " I have never spoken a truer word . An unpleasant two hours , a good chance of getting beamed before that , a set of ruined clothes  --  and that old devil the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . And , damn it , not even a chance to turn a small personal profit . What was I going to do , rifle the Follins woman 's purse ? Eventually , I 'd get paid  --  Hell , I had n't hired on for the thrill of the thing , not exactly . No . But that would be Comity money , and subject to Comity tax , and All in all , I told myself , not really a good day . Now , according to instructions , I just had to wait until I could be exchanged . Stern was n't shooting regular Secret Service people as spies  --  he was n't releasing them while their information might still have value , of course , but I did n't come into that category , since mine was out of date in three days max  --  but exchanging them just like regular POWs . In a few weeks , I was told , I could be expecting exchange . Meanwhile : sit quietly and wait . Daddy will take care of everything . That , I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet had come off . Left alone , I spent about fifteen minutes commiserating with my head . Then , conscious that all sorts of spy-rays for sound were probably tuned in on me , and that a guard with nice sharp ears undoubtedly waited outside the metal door of that metal room  --  and that there might be an invisible peephole he could look through now and then , too  --  I said the Hell with Daddy and his instructions , and I went to work . They had not left me my beamer , my field distorter , or much of anything else . I had some business cards ( Gerald Knave : Survivor  --  I had the weird feeling that they should have added on , for this one job alone , Incompetent Spying Done Cheap ) and a pack of cigarettes , guaranteed harm- less by the manufacturer  --  no Earth tobaccos  --  and by an analyst in the Stern HQ . The cigarettes were self-lighting . I had a handkerchief , too . A cheap job with my initials on it in red . The Follins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flamboyant , " she said , " as such people always are . " Really ? But it had passed the handkerchief . I got it out of my pocket . I shut my eyes and sat down in the middle of the room ? no chair , no table , no nothing , and light from a glow-panel ceiling  --  and tried to orient myself . The damn head made it difficult . I 'd come in  --  probably  --  through the back . Almost certainly , but it did n't make any real difference . I 'd seen a bit of window in the questioning room , and it had looked out on a side alley . Not the one I 'd been crouching in and wriggling through . Out of the questioning room , then , down a short flight , sharp turn to the right , heading toward the door of my metal confinement cabin .. . I went over it several times . I had to be facing the alley I 'd started from , if I put my nose against the wall furthest from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped for metal ; I could have done with wood , or even the imitation plastic that 's used more often . The plastic would n't burn , but it melted nicely at sufficient heat . And that , I had . I tore my handkerchief into small bits . I was very careful with it , and I kept my back to the door . I doubt if I made any noise louder than half a decibel : that handkerchief was my own idea , and made for tearing . I gathered up the resulting litter in one hand and stood up . I walked toward the door , looked it over  --  there might  | have been a spyhole , but I could n't see it , which proves nothing these days  --  and walked back to the opposite wall . I let myself look dejected . My shoulders slumped . I sat down with my back to the wall . Then I put my head in my hands , palming the litter . I wanted it to stay dry , at all costs . Slowly , I turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still looked dejected from the rear , I hoped . What I was doing was piling most of the litter against the wall . If it did n't lead outside .. . Well , it did . I knew that . It had to . I made a nice , neat , compact pile . Then I spit on it . I 'd been saving up spit . I got it wet , and spit again and got it wetter , and then moved back in a Hell of a hurry . Call the next occurrence a side bet . The litter , naturally , went up in white-hot flames . Went through the metal wall  --  and the plastic backing it , I discovered  --  like a beamer . There 's a sodium compound that will do that nicely if you add water ; there are several , in fact , including the pure metal , but only one you can weave into a flamboyant handkerchief . Call it a ten-second fire . In that time the guard might , or might not , happen to look in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he did  --  that was the side bet . I won it : he did n't call for help . Instead the door opened and he came charging in with a beamer ready . They never , never , shoot first . They always tell you they 're going to . I have no idea why . " Halt ! " this one said . " I 'll fire ? " Really ? I had a little handkerchief litter left . I spat on it and tossed it at him .  | Instant flamethrower . He got the Hell out of the way . In another five seconds he 'd have recovered enough to see , and maybe aim . By then the hole was cool enough to get through . I got into the alley . I heard shouts behind me . I moved  --  I do n't think I have ever moved so fast through plain old city streets . And on Pupil III I have an advantage : it 's known as long legs . All other things being equal , a six-foot man can outrun several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in condition and they were not , mostly . Of course , they were armed .. . But shooting up streets in a peaceful city far from the fighting  --  well , it just is n't done . Anyhow , it is n't done much . A beam or two did pass me as I went round a corner here and across a lot there . Nothing serious , though : I was zigging and zagging again where I could , crouching where I could , and concentrating on speed above all . Nobody can outrun a beam ; but you can , it seems , get out of the range of one . I did that , after a while . I hit my hotel a little winded . But they were very polite . Tourists did all sorts of strange things . And my room was equipped , unknown to the hotel , with a few special devices I rather hoped I 'd have a need for After all , I still had to get off the planet . Miss Follins made it with me  --  the informative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had to make it look peaceful ; they had to come at me one at a time  --  two at the most . They had to come up in the elevator like any normal guest . ( They did n't have to announce themselves ; there were Stern sympathizers in the hotel , and they could pre- tend to be visiting one of them . ) They even had to knock on the door . So they made the best of it . A knock , and a voice saying : " Maid service . " I thumbed a button . " Come in , " I said , and she came in . Right into a freeze beam . She never had a chance to get off a shot  --  she was carrying a freezer , not a fatal job , which made sense in a way . She just came in and fell , flat , like a board . I caught her . I dragged her over to the bed and put her on it . Then I prepared the rest of my equipment , and waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags will hold a lot , when you do n't fill them with clothing or other inessentials . And it was n't really a very long wait . She came to after about half an hour . I 'd had the beam set on the door for a weak charge , not wanting to spend a lot of time waiting for fake maids or bellboys to wake up . She opened her eyes . I wondered whether she 'd done it in less than eight seconds from waking time . " You , " she said . It was the only printable word she used , in rather a long speech . " Knave , " I said . " Did you know you were leaving Pupil III ? " Her face worked . " You ca n't  --  you 'll never get away with ? " " I know , " I said . " It 's a wrench , but try to bear up . You 'll probably be exchanged quickly . " She discovered somewhere in there that her hands were tied and that she was wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old man , " I said . " And you are going to be my companion . I am going to lean on you . I 'll  | untie your hands , but do n't try to reach your hat or I 'll set it off . " " Set it ? " " Sodium fiber again , " I said . " Combine it with water  --  I spat on the stuff in my little cell , for instance ; I might just do that to your hat  --  and it goes up in a very hot , very sudden flame . " " But ? " " You will escort me to a cab , " I said . " We will go to the port . My ship is waiting there , and I 've got it set up for instant clearance , as required . When I leave the cab , I leave you  --  safe with your hat . " I displayed her beamer . " Of course , I 'll have to keep this as a souvenir , " I said . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , " I said , " I think it might be a better choice . How much of this is Carshin going to believe ? I overpowered you , forced you to help me escape . . . I have n't known the man for long , but he does not strike me as either friendly or credulous . " Her eyes went wide and she swallowed hard . " So , " I said , " I suggest that you come with me . Things might be a little simpler out of the way  --  on some other world . You can be exchanged  --  but by then , maybe the story will be a little more believable . The details will have leaked out . Carshin , even , will believe you  --  without too much questioning . " " You ? " She was off again . " I assure you , " I said , " that I have no ulterior motive . " Well , I did n't  --  not the sort she might have thought of . She was really an extraordinarily ugly woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time . She never really got friendly , and when I turned her over to Anthetor 's people in the Comity worlds  --  the Comity worlds do n't play favorites , anybody can set up an apart- ment or so  --  she still had all of her vocabulary . She even had her hat  --  I left it with her as a souvenir , along with a word of advice : " If you do ever wear it again , dear , " I said , " pray it does n't rain . " And  --  because I could n't resist the temptation  --  I told her what I 'd been doing on Pupil III . Clearly I was not the incompetent I had looked like . " No , " I said , " I was a wheelbarrow thief . " She blinked . She did n't get it , which made me just as happy , in case she did get exchanged some time or other . Nobody hears the old stories anymore . But this one . . . It seems ( the version I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pole who worked in a factory during the occupation of his country by the German Hitler . ( The Poles were always getting occupied by somebody ; in eight centuries they had less than fifty years of independence . ) Every morning he reported for work , and every evening he wheeled out his wheelbarrow , full of his daytime needs  --  lunchbox , special clothing , whatever . The guards at the factory gate were sure he was stealing something . So they searched the thing every night . A fine-tooth-comb search . A search of microscopic depth . I mean , they really did a job . And there was nothing in the wheelbarrow but the lunchbox , the special clothing , and so forth . Damn it , he had to be stealing something . Every day , for months , the guards went over that wheelbarrow . And nobody ever found a thing . Years later , after the war ( when Poland was occupied by somebody else  --  Russia , I think ) , this particular Pole met one of those guards . " Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , it does n't make any difference  --  I could n't arrest you , I would n't  | even want to . But  --  we were sure you were stealing something . Now  --  please  --  ca n't you tell me what it was ? " And the Pole smiled . " Certainly , " he said . " I was stealing wheelbarrows . " That , you see , was the second bet . The other one that came off  --  that had to come off , if I were to get back alive and unscrambled . My assignment had been simple : get captured . Make them believe you 're a spy  --  make them question you . It seems the Anthetor people had a new hypnotic protective . It was proof against any questioning they knew about  --  even stuff like Carshin 's little personal incentives . An operative literally could not talk  --  and he could be supplied with a cover story that would pass any machine known . Hell of a thing . But the catch was , of course , " any machine known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't shanghai , or one of the Stern people  --  there were lots of candidates ? had come up with something new ? The Secret Service people did n't really like the job : it went against their grain , more or less . Me , I could n't resist it . It sounded funny as Hell . And in spite of the headaches , in spite of Carshin  --  Hell , in spite of my clothes ! ? I still think it 's funny . What were you stealing ? Wheelbarrows . What was your assignment as a spy ? Right . To be captured and questioned . Well  --  Anthetor runs Pupil III now , and all the little bureaucrats are much happier . Maybe the people are , too . Carshin , at any rate , was executed  --  either that or he died of high blood pressure ; I 'm not really sure . But I do have a few regrets . The Comity 's money ( Mis- cellaneous Funds , Unofficial , We Never Gave You A Cent ? but declare it on your income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd have run the whole operation at a staggering loss if it had n't been for Cecily Scriber , the Secret Service Chief for whom I 'd done my Incompetent Spying . I did make sure of that  --  the Anthetor Secret Service reward , payable in fine , undeclarable Pupil III cash , for bringing in a high-ranking Stern operative . I suppose that Follins woman could call it an ulterior motive  --  wherever the Hell she is now , with my nice hat .  | A computer magazine , as I 've said , asked me for some stories , and Knave obliged by telling some . This is the first of them , and it appears that the level of computer sophistication on Rigel IV is a bit higher in some ways than we 're used to here and now . But the " clean room " concept is one we seem to have grown out of mostly . Indigo Hill sounds like a great coffee . I 've never tasted any , damn it . THE VERY BEST DEFENSE I do n't seem to meet many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefers to carry on his sporadic wars with the aid of a lot of loud shouting and almost nothing else . There are times when I have myself convinced that the thing is a form of handicapping , like weight on a racehorse , or one arm tied behind your back . ) Possibly , this lack in my life is due to the nature of my trade : Gerald Knave : Survivor is distinctly not a pacifist , though I wave smoking guns and the like just as seldom as possible . I hire out to the Comity of Planets , or smaller governments , for new-planet testing , mostly , and I survive  --  using anything my employer can be convinced is Standard Colony Survival Material , plus whatever I can cobble up out of the materials on hand . It 's an interesting trade , and there is a lot of room at the bottom . But it 's only a living , not a life : I spend as much time as I can just relaxing , on various fine planets here and there , and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only really dangerous thing in this universe : human beings . Gerald Knave : Survivor figures  | to be in a different social circle from your average everyday pacifist . On the other hand .. . Maybe there just are n't very many . There is an entire worldful of these oddities  --  Rigel IV , believe it or not , the place that has the plant stampedes , or did until I came up with a way ( for a very nice fee , of course ) of domesticating the local bushes . Rigel IV turned into a planet colonized by vegetarian herdsmen , so to speak , a peaceful , damn dull place I seldom bothered to visit , and thought of with affection only because of their finest export . I grind my own coffee . ( I brew my own tea , too , and polish my own silver , and so on . I do own a Totum , with a couple of Bobbies slaved to him , but I do n't flip on the mechanical help unless I 'm feeling depressed , or lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names of the beans ? mostly from preSpace , since coffee is one of the plants that seems to take solid root on a lot of planets , and the plantation owners like tracing their heritage all the way back  --  are music to my ears : Jamaica High Mountain , Kenya , Colombia Top Grade , Kona . . . and , just maybe the top of the list , Indigo Hill . Rigel IV was dotted with Indigo Hill plantations . I thought with affection of the place whenever I put in a new order ; and when I heard there was some trouble , and the local government , such as it was , wanted to hire Gerald Knave and did n't want to dig down and pay his fee ? well , what else could I do ? I got through to the locals by phone , and said I 'd be out in a couple of days ( true : I have what may be the only General , Unlimited space-four card in civilian hands ; I have what may be the best-equipped small ship around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ) , and prepared myself for hyperspace travel ? i.e. : I loaded the ship with extra music and book tapes , because there is nothing either to see or to do in space- four once you 've shot yourself into it with a destination , or anyhow nothing reasonable  --  and , on that phone link across about eighty light-years , I had grandly waived my fee . No money , I said , would be required . The locals believed this . It sometimes seems to me that the " intelligent " part of the pacifist definition is due for a long look-over . Sure . Rigel IV , where the bush and the walking-tree play , was the pacifist planet . Seldom was heard a discouraging word , and even less often the sound of normal battle . The herdsmen were the pacifists ; it was the new arrivals , a gang who 'd decided to citify the place , who were making warlike noises . The herdsmen were not about to toss their holdings away to be made into expensive cities , and , though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fun is in them , I agreed with the herdsmen . There were lots of cities elsewhere . But there was n't , and is n't , the Hell of a lot of Indigo Hill coffee . Local spaceport , local checkout , local Customs checkout , long drive to the huddle of buildings they called a seat of government  --  nothing especially interesting . I had no dangerous plants in my suitcases , and I was not smuggling pesticides . I was n't a computer technician , either , which was a damned shame . Because the herdsmen  --  the original Rigel IV government and citizens  --  had survived mounting attacks from the newfangled city fellers , so far , only because they had an extremely well-educated computer . Purely defensive . They assured me of that . They went on assuring me of that every ten minutes until I was even sicker of the words than I thought I 'd be . The computer a big one , because Rigel IV herdsmen are rich folk anyway , constructed mostly under shields , in orbit , and moved down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather , any remaining wild-plant stampedes ,  | and most of the red tape that seems to go with any government , anywhere . But it had lots of spare time , and when it was asked to provide a defense it hummed , and clicked , and lit up here and there , and spat out a set of instructions . In computer language : this one did n't talk any standard speech , but one of the preSpace computer affairs ? Logjam , I think . When translated , the instructions provided a full set of defensive screens over the entire cultivated farming area of Rigel IV . Nothing could get through the screens except light ( there was a blink-off effect set to random times , under a second at a time , to provide for air ) . Anything that tried Well , it would n't be fried , or flattened , or beamed , or shot full of little holes  --  whatever your standard picture of a defense screen is . If it hit a screen , and kept on going into it  --  it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed that , once such a thing disappeared , it disappeared throughout time : it not only did n't exist , and would n't next week , but never had . Nobody was quite sure : that was the computer 's business . But it was purely defensive , whatever the Hell it had set up . Purely defensive . A couple of hours in , I programmed my ears to cut out when those words happened ; but my programming for such things is subnormal . Purely , the Minister of Defense said , purely defen " Well , all right , " I said . " So what do you need me for ? What do you need anybody for ? The bad guys are locked out , the crops are coming in fine  --  why tap a survival expert ? " He was a little guy , maybe eighty , with long white moustaches and pure-blue eyes , and a lot of white hair generally . Maybe he weighed seventy pounds , all told . " It 's a question of power , " he said in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister of Defense . " You see , Mr. Knave ? " I cut him short , because I did see . Any screen takes power to set up and power to sustain . A job like this one looked to draw enough power to run , maybe , a small-sized sun for a while . Rigel IV did n't have that kind of power , not for long . I doubt even the Comity has . As it stood , the herdsmen were tapping Rigel itself to run the screens , via their overgrown computer  --  which is what you might call a chancy operation . " How long ? " I said . He lifted his eyebrows . He had the hell of a lot of white eyebrows , all bunched up over those blue , clear eyes . " Three days , " he said . " Perhaps two . " " And then ? " " And then , " he said , very gently and very slowly , " we are lost . We will not fight . We have only this one defense . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive it ; nor our way of life . " It did n't seem worth the bother to tell him that the war was on , and had been for some time . Maybe , in some corner of that pacifist brain , he knew it . Maybe he also knew that wars are not won by Ministries of Defense . " So I 'm supposed to go out and mop up these wild men ? " Everybody looked horrified . We were in the Briefing Room : a small beamed chamber in the center of the largest stone house around . " Good Lord , " the Minister of Defense said . " Of course not . Mr. Knave ? " " Knave , " I said . " Very well : Knave , " he said . " We would not condone violence : we certainly did not attempt to hire it . We wish to survive ; but we will not attack what you call the wild men ' ? our enemies . Nor will we allow you to do so . Even  | our computer is programmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I know , " I said . " Purely defensive . " " Exactly , " he said , and everybody beamed at me . My job had now been clearly explained to me . All I had to do was to end a war , and save the herdsmen and their land . Without ( so to speak ) stepping on any toes . Fighting definitely not permitted . All right : so how do you win a war you 're forbidden to fight ? You see why I was sorry not to be a computer technician ? Even if the thing had been programmed for pacifism , it was logical  --  they always are , which is not an endearing trait , but seems to be a useful one . Maybe , just maybe , the computer was my ally . Sure as Hell , nobody else was . I am not a computer technician . What I am , in a way , is a computer . A survivor is not this character you see on 3V , complete with sizzling beamers or slug guns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information collector . You never know what bit of information you 'll need until you need it  --  which is no time to go out and find it . So you collect all the bits you can , just like a computer , and you file them away in your head , and you hammer that head into constructing for you an access system good enough , and dependable enough , to lean on . So I knew a little about computers , because I know a I little about anything . Some things , more than a little , but except for coffee they do n't figure , not in this report , so the Hell with them . I got myself an official pass , and then I got myself as antiseptic as was comfortably possible , and left my cigarettes with the Minister of Defense ( I did n't leave my guns with him , nor mention that I had any ; but  | of course I did : a survivor may not need slug gun or beamer often , but when he does , nothing else will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , undressed ) . By that time I was at one end of a fairly long corridor in the only metal , modern-city-like building in the government complex . The building did n't house the computer . Four stories high , maybe one city-sized square long and wide , it was the computer . Which may give you some idea , miniaturization being what it is : I can carry a pocket computer , memory , tap access to the Comity file computers if in range , and a good many odd functions , in one hand and never notice the weight . And so can you ( minus the tap access : that , like my very special space-four card , was the Gift of a Grateful Government  --  in other words , something extorted with difficulty from many rude and redfaced bureaucrats ) . This computer was n't pocket-sized . They 'd told me what the thing could do , and had done ; walking along inside it , down that corridor , I began to believe them . The thing could be programmed to destroy the city slickers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The computer had enormous power . But it was a pacifist . So programmed : maybe people can change their own programming , but not that computer : the poor thing never had a chance . I had a guide , a nice enough teen-ager who looked as if the computer had dreamed him up . He wore a white smock and white socks and shoes ; the only real touch of color ( I ca n't count his skin , which was heading rapidly toward a sort of deathly pallor ) was a pair of hornrimmed glasses . He did n't like letting me in to Central Programming : they never do . But I had the official pass . He did n't even argue with me : he just looked miffed . Pacifism in action , I guess .  | The computer had a name . All computers have names , though a few are a bit idiosyncratic , like the space-port tracking box on Alpha Centaurus IV , which is called 774-11 . A few are unpronounceable ( by humans , at any rate ) ; this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Gandhi . I half-expected to walk in and see a figure in Earth Indian peasant dress , holding a begging-bowl and talking in Logjam , or whatever that language is . What I got was a collection of consoles : four walls of desks , with readout screens , buttons , printout boxes ( like newpaper fax outlets , if you really have to know , and they use the same paper , that heavy , slightly shiny stuff ) , and , as they say , so on . I looked around me , noticed no strangers , and told my guide to go away . He objected . Violently , of course . The thing I have never met , and never expect to , is a pacifist who does n't raise his voice . Most of them get louder , faster , than any other beings around . This guide took six minutes of careful , detailed , constant persuasion before he choked out an agreement that my pass said what it actually did say , and that I could be trusted alone with Gandhi . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four walls were repeats : that is , every wall had an **28;1515;TOOLONG setup , from typer to printout box , as the center of its arrangement . I picked my favorite wall , sat down in one of those computer-room chairs not built for human beings ( as usual : except for the size , and the pacifism , Gandhi followed tradition , good and bad ) , and stared at the keyboard in front of me for a while . Thinking . All right : the total defense shield could be maintained for two more days ( I take the most conservative possible  | estimate : unless you do , you are not going to live long enough to get business cards printed up , not in my trade ) , and after that the barbarians were going to take over , and turn the whole damned place into cities . Apparently they had some sort of contract with a semi-legal colonization outfit , and Rigel IV fit the specs : the Comity does n't pay colony leaders per head , but these semi-legal boys do , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can among the vegetarian herdsmen . Given permission to fight , the whole thing would have been simple . I 'd have used the computer as a search-anddestroy weapon , programming it to ignore colonists already filed as herdsmen , and gimmicking it to focus a nice , fatal beam on anybody else it sensed ; the thing had , of course , planet-wide sensor nets . ( " Of course " because without them how would the shielding system have been set up to begin with ? ) Figure fifteen deaths  --  maybe ten ? and the city slickers raise ship and go looking for an easier job . And there were other ways . Lots of other ways . I spent more time than I should have thinking them up , cancelling them , and regretting them . After a time , I cleaned out my head and started in for real . And to tell you the truth , it did n't take long : I punched in one query over the key-board , and got one answer . Translated from Logjam , or whatever : How long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all shields expand outward at a set rate ( a nice , slow one , which I selected ) until shielding covers all planetary sur-face ? Translated from same idiot language : 0.76 days . Long enough : Rigel IV days are 1.063 Earth normal , a closer fit than usual , and that sounded like enough time . I pushed back the chair and stood up . Job completed .  | Almost . I sat down again and punched in my own specs , telling Gandhi to file its own sensor data on me under Herdsman , Native . Then  --  after I 'd turned white at that afterthought  --  I gave the thing its instructions . After which , naturally , I disappeared . With scarcely a trace . My old friend the Minister of Defense asked me , two days later , just how I 'd managed to drive the bad guys off the planet . He was very anxious to be sure I 'd managed it without violence . " It 's a little complicated , " I said . " But I used only the purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 've programmed the sequence in , " I told him . " If anybody else ever settles here and tries to swat you people away , just tell Gandhi : Take defensive action A. You wo n't have any trouble ; and I guarantee nonviolence . Purely defensive . " He thought it over for a while . He was not about to take my flat , unsupported word in the matter , which was sensible . But he had more than that , and I could see it come to him . He had the computer itself : Gandhi had been very carefully programmed against offensive actions , or any sort of violence . And he had the sequence I 'd programmed in . Later , after I was gone  --  in order not to offend my sensibilities , of course  --  he could query Gandhi for the details of " defensive action A. " I 'd be off-planet by then  --  but if it turned out I 'd managed to turn Gandhi violent and non-pacifist , he could always register a formal complaint against me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , these days : formal red tape from Rigel IV would be taken seriously back in the Home Worlds , and I might not get many more jobs . On the other hand , if I 'd actually turned the trick according to the rules  --  why was n't I telling him how it had been done ? Answer : For the same reason I 'd sunk out of sight for two days  --  I 'd wanted to avoid questions then , and I wanted to avoid explanations afterward , in order not to offend his sensibilities . I really did n't want to tell him just how fatal a purely defensive measure was . I 'd instructed Gandhi to expand the screens , to cover every inch of the planet , farm , city , spaceport or blank . And I 'd told it to make the screens selective : they were to avoid every object native to Rigel IV , every person in the files as a herdsman , every structure or implement belonging to any such person ( that one took a while ; it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took four times as long in Logjam ) , and two more categories : me , my ship and belongings ; and its own sensors and other structures . Computers have no bias against suicide . A selective screen of Gandhi 's total-defense sort was even trickier than tapping Rigel for power , but I knew it could be managed : if the thing could be set for random blinks on and off , in order to keep up a supply of breathable air , it could be set for detailed selection . Gandhi was the Hell of a competent computer ; it managed , and , as far as I know , never complained . And anything the screens did touch  --  anything they had n't been instructed to avoid  --  simply disappeared . No violence . How can you be violent toward a person who is n't there ? How can you be violent toward a person  | who ( according to some theorists , as reported earlier ) never was there ? No violence . Just disappearance . The best defense is a good offense . A very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it much : it 's as true as ever . And when my friend the Minister asked Gandhi about " defensive action A , " he 'd find out that it was simply an expansion , from eight separated points on Rigel IV , of his purely defensive screens , until they 'd covered every inch of planetary surface . Nothing violent about that , was there ? And go ahead , friend : ask Gandhi about the fate of our old acquaintances the city slickers . Gandhi 's reply ( translated ) : What city slickers ? I 'd fed in , as fact , the floating theory : whatever disappeared had never existed at all . Make a man disappear with that screen , and what Gandhi will tell you about the man is : Who he ? Just that , and nothing more . So I fought their war for them ( without fighting it ) and won it ( without getting paid for it ) . Well . . . I did n't get any money . I 'd agreed to that . But if the grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill beans , nicely roasted , and shielded to stay fresh in the hold of my ship . . . I could n't really offend their delicate sensibilities by refusing , could I ? Especially after I 'd pretty well hinted them straight into the notion in the first place .. .  | I 'm as fond of good con games as Knave is , and it 's always a treat to see one run backwards . The Analog illustration for this one , by the way , showed Knave with a beard . Knave does not have a beard . That 's me . EXPIRATION POLICY A bureaucracy is ( by definition ) a mistake . The definition is mine , and it arises out of long and painful experience . My business card says Gerald Knave : Survivor . It 's an interesting career , and every so often it means that the Comity finds out where I am , and asks me to go out to some uncolonized pill or other and live there for a while . I usually do , and when I come back I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saurians of Rasmussen , or the poisonous midges of Ferris , or maybe just a lot of volcanic action , combined with earthquakes , lightning , hurricanes , and other bothersome catastrophes . Since I do come back , my report is also filled with ways to get round these difficulties . Many people , and the usual small boggle of computers , get together at this point ? sometimes , unluckily , with me , if I have not had the good sense to leave for almost anywhere else  --  and study what they have called my Recommendations . After a while , they all get tired of doing this , and one way or another a colony is sent out . The colonists are issued one-way , onetime-only space-four cards , they get several speeches and a mixed bag of supplies , and usually  --  not always  --  the human race grabs hold on another planet . The bureaucracy keeps talking about dangerous planets , dangerous animals , dangerous climates , and all that  | sort of thing ; this is their mistake , and it is not possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 've tried . There are no dangerous planets . Some are uninhabitable  --  by humans , anyhow . Except for the Astronomical Dome , anybody who wants Pluto can have it , and Jupiter is waiting for a race with strange enough tastes to happen along just to keep things in the Solar System , where the Comity bureaucrats are . The inhabitable planets are survivable . There are no dangerous animals , or climates , or ? Well , you get the idea . There is only one dangerous thing in the Galaxy , so far . Its name is Intelligent Life , and except for actual war or absolute threat thereof , Intelligent Life tends to define as Man . If you happen to be FemLib , you can add Woman ; the rest of us are content with standard grammar . So , every once in a while , I like to do my own checking . I go out and try surviving on a world that offers some real threats  --  a world that has human beings on it . Human beings can kill you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They can even  --  well , take a look at Alphacent , for instance . That 's the world that has the Ancestors . Capital A. Alphacent was one of the first extraSolar worlds , and by now it 's developed its own traditions . And the biggest , most visible tradition around is this business of Ancestors . On Alphacent the Ancestors run things . All it takes to be a power in the land is dying . Once you are dead and nicely planted ( the Cents have cemeteries the way other people have luxury resorts ) , your word is law . Naturally , there is a small group of specialists in every town on the planet , who listen to the Ancestors and pass this word along ; it would be a little too much to expect the Ancestors to do all the work themselves . The trouble is that the specialists are perfectly honest .  | There seems to be a sort of nut strain in the Alphacent gene pool , and these half-psi people pop up all over the place . They have visions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time staring at walls , and a few of the most highly respected ones have developed eye it certainly looks it ; a specialist can drop into his trance any old time and spend hours lying in the road , surrounded by worshipful locals , until he snaps out of it , blinks a few times , and recites the latest commandments from Beyond . The system seems to work about as well as any form of government ever works . I have no idea what that means , and I refuse to speculate on it . To tell the truth , I prefer bureaucracy . A little , anyhow . That trip , I hit Alphacent with nothing more on my mind than taking a better look at those specialists . Maybe there was some sort of authentic psi talent to be dug out of the goops . Maybe the times had produced the men , so to speak , and the thing was a disease , and curable  --  that was an interesting notion , because if I could prove it I would be in an extraordinarily doubtful spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you cure it ? And maybe there really are Ancestors , directing the show from that great home of omniscience and second thoughts , the Beyond . What the Hell , it 's possible . And a survivor ( by definition again ) is an information collector . What keeps me alive is knowing the right fact  --  but I have no idea what it is until I need it . So I collect as much information as I can , and hope that some of it will be handy for the next tight spot I get myself into .  | Alphacent has a spaceport , but it 's manned by starship troops  --  the level of technology is too high for the world to support on its own . I exchanged military-type greetings , found a car  --  an honest wheeled jobbie , no ground-effects cushion and no helpful little brain in case of sudden stops ? and headed out toward a town I remembered , about sixty kilometers outside the posted spaceport land . The place had been called Thrush , and it had been a well-to-do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud huts had actual plastiglass windows , for instance ( offworld traders do show up ; the world has some interesting mineral deposits ) . The leader of the living  --  a sort of submayor ? had been a tall , proud man named Alfroid ; I remembered him with some affection , since he could tie loose knots in iron bars , and had drunk me under the table one evening  --  no , an evening and a morning and part of an afternoon . I came to Thrush , and even the outskirts looked different . The huts were tumbling down ; the people I saw , and I did n't see many , were wearing flat-out rags and looked like refugees from a seminar on Starvation ; the whole town , in the middle of a bright , hot , sunny afternoon , looked as if it carried its own cloud around with it , all the time . Something had gone very wrong . Four years Alphacent ? about three and a half Standard just is n't that long a time . I drove on through to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped in front of it . I remembered it had had four fine plastiglass windows and a metal door . But the window-spaces were boarded up , and the door was a flapping curtain . I climbed out of the car and Emsy came running from the house waving her arms and sounding glad to see me . Emsy was Alfroid 's wife and spare mayor , a girl about as big as your average ten-year-old , with round wide eyes  | and ringlets of gold hair . Altogether a decoration in the landscape . " The strong man ! " she was shouting . " The strong man has come back ! " I took that kindly , remembering Alfroid  --  but nobody counted Alfroid as a strong man , he was just a local , he lived there . I went the ten yards or so necessary to meet a running Emsy , and she hit me like a tackler , threw her arms around me and went on making happy sounds . " Where 's Alfroid ? " I said after a bit . She turned to stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her eyes would n't look at me . " He has not been respected . " In other words , he had opposed some decree of the Ancestors , and been hit over the head with the town . The town looked as if it had hit something , I will say that ? something about the size and shape of a plague . " Let 's go see him , " I said , and disengaged myself , took her arm and started back across the dirt street to the house . " Maybe we can think of something to cheer him up . Emsy dragged her feet . " How can he be cheered ? " she said . " The Ancestors have spoken . " " Well . . . " Suggesting that the Ancestors might have been wrong was not the correct move . I 'd had a lot of fun in Thrush , and as it happened , I 'd been fairly popular here and there ; but that suggestion would make me as welcome as an import of Ferris 's poisonous midges , even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd gone no further than to suggest a second consultation , just in case the Ancestors had been misunderstood . He was lying on a pallet in an inside room . Kids were running in and out  --  they 'd had four , I think , the last time I 'd hit the world , and there seemed to be several more this time around  --  and making fairly happy noises , but Alfroid was immune . He lay like a statue , seven feet tall  | and beginning to waste away , his eyes deep in his head and his face set in an expression that looked like the origiI nal for every mask of tragedy I had ever seen . " I heard the sounds , " he said . His voice was a big resonating sound , something to shatter trees with . Or it had been ; it was dying away . " I am glad to see Knave with us again . But he will not remain long . " Emsy said : " Perhaps he will . Perhaps he will help ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Ancestors have spoken . There is nothing more to do ; we are at an end . " I looked around , and found a three-legged stool . I balanced myself on it , and Emsy went out and came back with local beer in two large clay mugs , and I said : " Tell me about it . " Alfroid looked at his mug . I took a good pull at mine , to give him a little inspiration , but he picked it up and looked at it and sighed and put it down on the floor next to his hand . " You do not know of the Chief Speakers , " he said . I ran down the list of occupations and titles I remembered from four years ago . " No , " I said . " Never heard of them ; what are they ? " " They know the Ancestors , " Alfroid said . " They are Speakers for all Ancestors , everywhere . " I took another pull at the mug . Emsy was sitting crosslegged on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding the thing with both hands ; she was one of the few human beings I 've ever known who could pass for an elf . " Where did these Chief Speakers come from ? " I said . " Every village has its own Ancestors . " " So it has always been , and all has been well , " Alfroid said . The talk seemed to be reviving him a little ; he actually took in some beer . I saw Emsy smile . " But the Chief  | Speakers have come , and they speak for all villages . They speak for Thrush , and Thrush will be no more . " " Now , wait a minute ? " I began . " I tell you , it is a proven thing , " Alfroid said . " It is only one year since our own Speakers told us of this ; and if you have come through the village you have seen the change . We are at an end . " I 'd been wondering about an extremely simple and nasty scheme , involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local Ancestors , grabbing everything of value in Thrush because the Ancestors had so commanded . But Alfroid was n't stupid . Neither were most Cents . A stranger making that claim would have to back it up ? with detailed knowledge of the Ancestors , for one thing . And , as Alfroid had just reminded me , with the agreement of the local Speakers  --  the half-psi goops Thrush used as regular mouthpieces for the tables of the law . So I asked some more questions , declined Emsy 's offer of dinner  --  there was n't enough to feed two adults and the passing crowd of children , and Thrush might still have an inn  --  and retired , looking as cheerful as possible and not fooling Alfroid at all , to think things out . The situation , clearly , was a little more complex than I 'd thought . Well , they usually are . And  --  down to one cook and one servant  --  there was an inn . Much food , and little beer , to keep my head clear , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . The roof did n't leak much . Running over what Alfroid had told me , pieced out by deduction where necessary , I came out with something like this : The Chief Speakers  --  offworlders for sure , since they had a different skin color ( which is damned rare in the  | Comity worlds these days , or the Frontier worlds either ) and wore clothing that shone , which I took to be spun silk or something of the sort  --  had n't begun with Thrush . They 'd started with another town , nearer the spaceport . And their story had been very simple . They were in constant touch with all the Ancestors of Alphacent . They had been living on Alphacent 's single moon for years and years , listening to the Ancestors and learning to communicate with them full-time , without the usual fits and starts . They were primed with wagonloads of casual detail . Murk 's father , who had died two years before , had had a blue birthmark on his lower leg . The mother of Durba , dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local chicken ( allergy , maybe ; but Alphacent did n't have the concept yet ) . The uncle of one of the local speakers , dead ten years , had never thought the girl would come to any good , and was most surprised to discover ( after his death ) her high status . And so on , and so on . Little details  --  and they all checked out . Then , one by one , the local Speakers  --  that town had three  --  went into trances and confirmed the high status of the newcomers . They were indeed Chief Speakers , and they were to be obeyed . In everything . Their edict was simple and brutal . Sell your house , sell your goods , dig up your money  --  bury it all in the center of the graveyard . In five years a tree bearing ten times as much would bloom there . Meanwhile , things might be tight , but when the five years were up every Cent would have more than he could ever need ; the tree would never stop blooming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nor the first one . He had been , I think , the first one not to be lynched .  | Damn it , this was the proven word of the Ancestors . Town after town  --  Hamback , and then Thrush a year ago , and by now halfway across the planet . It would not be hard tracking them down  --  but what did I do then ? Killing them recommended itself to me . There were only three of them , and it seemed a contribution to world sanitation . But first of all , doing it without getting lynched myself looked like an interesting trick ; and second , once they were dead they were Ancestors themselves , and their last commands would be even more thoroughly obeyed . In five years , people would find out that the trees were n't going to bloom . But by then there might not be any Cents left to care ; those Chief Speakers had been thorough . After some thought , it struck me that I needed one fact . I had to know when these Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be about five days before they had turned up at the first town . I went back to the spaceport next morning , driving that monster of a car as if I were convinced it would n't up and kill me , and had a talk with the staff . They could n't interfere with the Cents , and did n't much want to ; they were on two-year tours of dull duty , and had no particular interest in the locals . If the Cents all died out , maybe the port would be closed down and they could go on to something more interesting ; it 's called the professional attitude . You ca n't quarrel with it much , people being built that way . Sometimes you can regret it . " About five days " : the actual figure was six . And Emsy answered one more question for me : had the Chief Speakers gone directly from town to town ? Well , not exactly . They 'd left Hamback four days before they arrived at Thrush ; and Emsy happened to know ? she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd  | left Thrush five days before arriving in Whetstone . The traveling distance , on foot , was maybe four hours . Late one night , therefore , I abducted a goop  --  pardon me , a Speaker  --  and robbed a graveyard . After that , all I had to figure out was how to play the hand . Halfway around the planet was just about right . I tracked them from town to town  --  the hell with that car , I borrowed a hell from the spaceport and set down in empty fields where I could , big crossroads where I could n't  --  and spent the better part of two weeks on the job . I walked into Jeritree at noon , just in time to hear the tail end of the standard speech . I was n't noticeable  --  not to offworlders . I 'd borrowed some local clothing from Alfroid before I set out , and had Emsy put a tuck in it here and there , since I am not seven feet tall , among other things ; and I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three Chief Speakers . Anybody from Jeritree would have caught me as a stranger at once  --  on Alphacent , all the towns are small towns , and everybody knows everybody , within reason ? but they were n't interested in me . The Chief Speakers had all the attention . " You have heard our proofs , " one was saying  --  the tallest one , about my size , with near-white hair and a stern expression . The clothing was silk , all right  --  with metallic glitter woven into it . It seemed pretty flashy for everyday . He went on : " You have heard your own Speakers . They tell you that we speak for the Ancestors of Jeritree . You have heard our talk of those Ancestors ; you know we speak truly . And our  | command comes from them  --  it brings no profit to us ; we are but messengers , who must obey their will . " So far , it was about as expected . But there was a new touch . " In Thrush , a town far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was a little murmur . Everybody knows everybody  --  within the local radius of travel . Thrush would be a sort of distant legend , brought vaguely up to date every few years . " In Thrush , the tree has already bloomed ! " the big one said . " You may ask your own Speakers  --  there , the good life has begun for everyone ! Yes , in Thrush ? " I turned off my ears . I did n't have to take any more . I only had to look passably native , and wait out the speech . And I thought about Thrush , where the good life had begun for everyone  --  where starvation was creeping in , and Alfroid was dying of pure uselessness . When the speech finally ended I faded off down a side street , and kept moving . I spent the day avoiding people and looking inconspicuous , which was fairly simple : the Chief Speakers were the only topic , and unless I had sprouted six green ears out of the center of my forehead nobody was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Speaker , I was n't an Ancestor , so it did n't matter what the Hell I was . Fine with me . Evening came at last , and with it the ritual burial of precious metals , hoards of valuables , titles to land  --  a whole town 's worth of value , sunk in one very large hole in the dead center of the Jeritree cemetery . The town trooped out for it , and I made one in the procession . Then the town trooped back , and I followed along until we came to a bend in the road and a slight rise . I went behind the rise , found a ditch , and disappeared .  | Nobody had noticed me come ; nobody noticed me go . Everybody was being very solemn . I heard them go by . Night noises started up ; every planet has its own orchestra , usually eight or nine different flavors depending on the particular continent , climate or season . Alphacent included one beast  --  a sort of insect with an inflatable thorax and a hell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I passed the time trying not to listen to it . Full dark came . The Alphacent moon gives about twenty percent of the light Earth 's moon provides ; Alphacent dark is a canful of gloom at the bottom of a rainbarrel . My eyes were used to it by then . I found my way back with no trouble at all . To my surprise , only two of the Chief Speakers were at the big hole , doing the digging . I like slug guns : they 're big and noisy and what they hit they stop . But there are occasions for silence , and that was one : I marked a spot in my head , about two feet from the mound , and hit it with a beamer . The dirt gave off a slight sizzle , and the beam was a very visible pencil of light . One of the duo  --  the tall man  --  said : " What the Hell ? " in Comity Standard , not Alphacent , and with an Earth accent  --  and all motion stopped . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either hand . I was just visible , no more ; it was enough . I said : " It 's all over . " And the spare third guy jumped me from behind . Well , he had to be somewhere . Maybe he 'd been resting , maybe he was covering the dig just in case . He made the hell of a good jump . If I had n't moved , he 'd have had me . But he 'd been audible back there , since my single beam . I stepped aside  | and he went straight on , arms outstretched , and landed with his nose in the half-dug hole . " What the  --  what do you mean , all over ? " the tall man said , after the crash . " Who the Hell are you ? We 're just ? " " I 've been tracking you from Thrush , " I said . " I 'm not a Cent . And you 're not a Chief Speaker  --  we 're even . " " Comity law ? " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own laws . Comity law ca n't touch us here . " He was right . If I 'd been the law  --  local or otherwise ? the point might have bothered me . On the other hand , it might not ; I could hardly imagine a human being who 'd let a little thing like the legal code stand in his way when dealing with these particular specimens . But I was n't the law . I was only just me  --  surviving . And helping Alphacent to survive , too . Wrapped and tied , the Speakers went back over the planet , town by town , explaining that the Ancestors had a new word for everybody , and arranging for the return of goods . I have never spent a more boring three weeks  --  but it was worth it to see the expression on Alfroid 's face when we got back to Thrush , and the money and the valuables and the land titles came back . Along with the new word from the Ancestors : " We have tested you , to see your obedience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back your goods  --  use them well , and prosper . " I left the Speakers their ship . They had not arrived on Alphacent totally broke ; but , except for the ship , they left that way  --  and were damned glad to do it . And they had not really tried anything very complex . It looked that way  --  but the answer was in that five-or-so days ' gap . Suppose you arrive just outside a town  --  secretly , by  | night , with all your glitter packed away . And you abstract the Speakers , maybe only one a night . And you do what can very easily be done to almost any psi , or half-psi , or epileptoid . . . Right . You hypnotize him . You fish out a lot of local Ancestor details , you give him a posthypnotic that assures you of his cooperation  --  he 's going to believe that the Ancestors spoke to him and gave you the okay  --  and you hand him a forgetter covering the actual hypnosis . You have to work slowly : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't kidnap Speakers carelessly ; it has to be worked in secret . So you spend five days  --  or four , or six , whatever it takes . And then , fully equipped , with confirmation assured from the local Speakers , you march on in , at Full Glitter , and start your act . Simplest thing in the world , damn it . I did n't tell anybody , pot even Alfroid or Emsy . You do n't tamper with belief unless you have to ; it has a very short fuse , and it may blow up the believer . Which is why I invented the face-saver for a story , and let the Speakers get off the planet . They had n't really studied up on Alphacent law , you see . A crime that might be punishable by death somewhere else is punishable differently on Alphacent ; after all , they do n't want to send criminals up among the Ancestors until they 've had time to repent very thoroughly and be good Ancestors themselves . So they have something a good deal worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloriously happy to get off the planet with their bare ship .  | A major criminal is kept most carefully alive  --  in constant pain . The process  --  it involves an Alphacent insect , though not the one that sounds like a strangled cat  --  is a little like being staked out on an anthill full of very dedicated army ants  --  and being very carefully fed and kept alive  --  for between five and ten years . At the end of that time , the criminal is repentant . He says so . He says a great deal  --  he is n't remotely sane any more . The Alphacents do n't kill people . They 're much more dangerous than poison , or volcanoes  --  they 're human beings . Of course , I 'm not a Cent , and I have a simple , direct mind . So , while I was going through their ship for valuables and taking what I found  --  well , it covered expenses , so to speak , and bought some baubles for Alfroid and Emsy 's kids  --  I planted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the last minute , and got out under the protection of the spaceport guard  --  Comity law , on Comity territory . If I calculated it right , and I should think I did , the Speakers became loose atoms and a little energy three days out , quite out of range , and not very noticeably . Just another accident ; and there are always accidents . I do n't regret it . They were men who could make a simple scheme work like a Swiss watch . And , my God , where would they have gone next ? And  --  what weak spot would they have hit ? Because every culture has one . Ancestors . . . bureaucrats . . . Something just waiting to be used as a target , by the only dangerous being around .  | They 're not all funny . And if you want to know why Knave takes things pretty lightly , here is a good reason . Either you learn to let things bounce off you , or  --  if you run into situations like this  --  you start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your parachute on the ledge . THE SAMARITAN RULE " The Law , " this Freiburg said , " is n't especially gentle , Knave , and it certainly is n't kind . " " Well , " I said , trying not to sound impatient , " it is n't meant to be . " Usually , when people start talking about Nouns like that , I make some small excuse , on the order of : " Pardon me , I have to go now , my hair is on fire , " and I get the Hell out of earshot . But this Freiburg type looked even younger and more innocent than he possibly could have been , and he was the sort of kid I tend to feel sorry for . I own and maintain a number of bad habits , but feeling sorry for the Freiburgs of this universe is one of my very worst . He was buying me a lunch expensive enough to qualify the restaurant we were in as a planetary bank of issue , and extensive enough to qualify us both for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that had much to do with my restraint . Talk about Nouns , after all , can ruin even the most beautifully created feast . Feeling sorry for Freiburg , and for me , I only sighed , and went on : " Law is just the rules of the game . And all the rules have to be is clear and complete  --  while provid- ing fitting penalties for breakage . Kindness has nothing to do with that . " " But it is n't a game , " he said , and sighed back at me , and took a small dig at his ortolans d la Careme . I took five or six somewhat larger digs at mine and wondered , with the back of my mind , whether the place had actually arranged for shipments of fresh birds via space-four , at truly staggering expense , or whether they 'd worked out a way to breed the little things right there on Kingsley . Having come to no decision  --  my mouth full and my mind very nearly empty  --  I said : " All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is  --  whatever people do  --  there have to be rules . The law is the set of rules . Why assume it ought to be kind or gentle ? Most rules are n't . " " But surely , " Freiburg said , " we 've progressed a little , over the centuries ? " The answer to that one depends . We 've expanded into a Comity of Planets , plus a large bag of Frontier Worlds and longer-settled Independents like Kingsley , all tied loosely into one government . We have sublight ships that make all the local stops inside a solar system , so to speak , and space-four jobbies that cover the express jumps in shiptimes ( and universe-times , plus or minus a few picoseconds ) ranging from three hours to three weeks . We have Totums , and Bobbies slaved to them , to do the work nobody much wants to do ; we have all sorts of maniacal technology ; and six or seven of us have even learned to brew decent coffee . None of which , of course , was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethical behavior , with maybe a little artistic appreciation thrown in ? we have n't progressed worth a damn . For some reason this fact depressed him ; as I say , he was young and innocent . I 'm not . Any day on which I wake up to discover that the entire human race has not regressed right on back to  | ritual cannibalism , plus the casual bashing-in of any available head that happens to irritate you , feels like a pretty good day . It may all be a question of expectations . It may also be a question of experience . I shrugged , cleaning up my plate and looking properly doubtful . " But so much of our law comes directly from past ages ! " He put down his eating-tackle and looked at me earnestly . " Not just pre-Comity , pre-Space  --  I mean all the way back to fifteenth-century England  --  or first-century Rome . Or even further back . The sort of rigid , merciless requirements ? " He sighed again . " That 's why I left law school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Knave , it 's why I hunted you up , when I heard you were on-planet . I want to train to be a Survivor . " Oh . God . A live waiter , coming round to shuffle our plates away , gave me a few seconds to devote to serious thought . I 'd met Freiburg during a previous stopover on Kingsley , when I 'd run into some types who had ambitions regarding a fair piece of his fortune , via a small adaptation of the Alien Clone con . I 'd disengaged them with very little effort , and in the ensuing celebrations I 'd mentioned my profession to the happy young billionaire . His reward had enabled me to hang up on official calls for planet-testingwhich is a Survivor 's primary business , no matter what the 3V adventure stories tell you  --  for better than a year , at the very top of my most cheerful standard of living . Billionaires can make good lawyers  --  given a sufficient itch for Service , which this Freiburg seemed to have . They will never make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've had too many things done for them . Dropped on a new planet with only the basic tapes on the place and your kit bag of standard equipment , your jumpiness , plus your total lack of any desire to tap some- body else , for anything  --  because there is n't going to be anybody else  --  is absolutely vital . I spoke slowly and carefully . " Frankly , I 'm not sure that would be such a very good ? " " I have to , Knave , " he said . " Survivors do good . They contribute  --  they  --  well , they help the human race . They help every race of beings . But lawyers . . . " His expression said that his opinion of lawyers was six levels lower even than mine . The waiter came back , with a something-or-other flambe . He let us appreciate it for a few seconds , during which a small idea nibbled at me . " Tell me , " I said when he 'd put the Thing out and retired , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There must have been something  --  an incident , a discovery ? " The Thing flambe had good rum in it , and raspberries . I took a spoonful , and then another , watching him riffle through his mind . " Have you ever heard of the Samaritan Rule ? " he said at last . I 've had bits of a fine Classical education , and a few shreds remain . I recited doggerel . " Thou shalt not kill , but needst not strive/Officiously to keep alive . " Something like that . Villon , or Shakespeare , or the Kalevala . One of the Western Classics , anyhow . " Close , " he said . " Actually , I have no idea who wrote it ? it 's an ancient law-students ' verse . Not quite the Rule , but in that area . If a doctor , say ? " He stopped and shut his eyes . He was being a lawyer . No lawyer can explain anything , ever , without at least one long pause , and one very earnest caution that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be entirely different . I was short on room , but I packed in three or four more  | loads of Thing flambe while I waited . Then his eyes opened . " Now , this is a general rule , " he said earnestly . " When it comes up  --  anywhere  --  it might be applied in some other way . And I 'm making it very simple . " So much for ritual . " But it 's like this : If a doctor , say , is walking down a street , and sees a person hurt , or even dying  --  he has no obligation whatever  --  no legal obligation , I mean  --  to offer help . But if he does offer help , and his help does n't follow ordinary medical practice  --  then he can be sued , by his patient , or the patient 's relatives . " My idea had borne enough fruit , thank God , for a whole new flambe . " Wait a minute , " I said . " He has to cure his patient , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Freiburg said . " He has to follow accepted medical practice . Then , whether he does any good or not , he 's in the clear . But if he tries anything new , he can be in bad trouble . And the worst part is  --  he can walk right on by . He never has to stop at all . Never . " " And that , " I said , " strikes you as rigid , cruel , and heart-less ? " " Well ? " he said . " Is n't it ? " " That , " I said , " depends , " and the waiter came by with cheese and coffee . I took a sip . Perfectly adequate coffee , which is a good deal better than you have any right to expect , anywhere or at any price . " Tell me , " I went on , " have you ever heard of Wankor ? Or the Hundred-percent Plague ? " " Wankor ? " he said . " Plague ? " " It 's public knowledge  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public does n't much want to know . I was part of the Team that got involved just about my first assignment . And it 's quite a story . " " Knave , " he said , " you ca n't brush me off by changing the subject ? "  | " I 'm not , " I said . " But you have to hear it all before you understand . Just sit back and listen for a bit . " He got settled . I sat back and shut my own eyes . It 's not what you 'd call a pleasant story . Not at all . Wankor 's density is near Earth 's , but the planet is only about three-fifths standard size , which gives you that cheerful low-gravity feeling until it dawns on you that a lot of the more vicious predators get around by a combination of leaping and sailplaning  --  like flying squirrels , but with the teeth , size , and casual ferocity of the average jaguar  --  so your own added leaping power gets cancelled out . A big moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that happens to be  --  except for the damned predators , sailing along with no trouble at all . It was n't a pure Survivor situation : Wankor had an intelligent race . In fact , they 'd discovered sublight travel some generations before , and had stumbled across the Vibich only a few standard years before our Survey Ships pinpointed the world and a Team was sent out  --  partly contact work , trying for friendly relations , and partly triplered-signal emergency aid . The Vibich had been their bad luck . God knows they have n't been bad luck for us , nor any sort of luck at all ; races own different sets of motives , and whatever the Vibich use involves their wandering around our galaxy , looking at all sorts of things but never stopping either to colonize or to make friends . Or , for that matter , enemies . They do n't seem to land on planets owning intelligent life , and they did n't land on Wankor . A Vibich threesome  --  the triplet of ships they always seem to use  --  had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Wankor exploration ship happened by , saw the landing from flyby , and messaged the ships . They got a return of their signals , which they took for Received and  | acknowledged , but not understood , and landed nearby . Four Pirrs went out in suits to make closer contact . ( As near as we know , that 's what they called themselves , just as Wankor is as near as we get to their name for their home world . ) The Vibich had n't seemed inimical , and the atmosphere read out fine , but they hung on to a little protection , just in case . They made contact on neutral ground , between the ships . They drew some diagrams and made some sounds . The Vibich let all this happen . They managed to exchange the fact that both races used spoken language . According to Pirr logs and medical reports , they exchanged a little more . The Vibich wear no suits ; and the Pirr suits were n't made really tight . Apparently , the Pirrs depended on a well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease of any kind from an alien race . Too many basic differences . Too many coincidences have to fall in . Human beings test every new contact with great care . The Pirrs had begun to depend on the odds  --  which work out at a good deal better than a million to one , but are no comfort at all if you turn out to be the one . The disease , unfortunately , had a nice long incubation period . The ship had plenty of time to get back to Wankor ? almost a standard year  --  before its crew started keeling over . And then everybody started keeling over . By the time we arrived , Wankor was one enormous Terminal Ward . Human beings are apparently immune to the Vibich , and to the Pirrs as well  --  otherwise , add a whole new set of coincidences to the pile already at work . We could try to help out . So  --  we learned what we could , and we worked to help the Pins , and we called back for a lot more help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . No idea at all . Look : if everyone in a single , medium-sized human city ? say three million people  --  fell suddenly and terminally ill . . . how big a hospital would you need ? How many doctors and nurses and orderlies ? How much in the way of medicine and water and food and bandages ? Think about it for a minute . And then try to figure out how many cities of that size it would take to populate Earth . Wankor was settled almost as densely . What we needed was three full planets ' worth of aid , of every sort . What we had was one Team  --  six human beings , learning as we worked . It figured out to nearly three billion patients per human being . Of course , help was on the way  --  a sizable shipment for rush-emergency support : maybe a hundred people . That would reduce the load to somewhere near one hundred and fifty million patients for each one of us . The death rate was reducing our load much faster than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop it . And we did n't stop it . I am not going to tell you about it in detail . It happened a long time ago , and we did everything we could , and seven or eight things that were flatly impossible , and we went on trying . You got so your heart broke twenty times a day  --  the Pirrs were so damned gallant and so damned stubborn , and one by one you were there as their limbs relaxed and their eyes shuttered closed . After the first week we knew there was no hope , and we went on working . Quitting was the only thing more painful than what we did . The Pirrs , of course , knew the score as well as we did . There had been enough time to figure things out , to know that the plague that had hit them had been a million-to- one galactic accident , and to realize that there could be no acquired immunity and was n't going to be any sort of immunity at all . They never blamed the Vibich . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or their law , to blame the Vibich . And they knew we were trying to help . When they really began to know that , we started taking precautions . We were being shot at . Traps were being laid for us . One group of Pirrs , just well enough to manage it , constructed a sizable bomb and damn near set it off under our landing-ship . And we lost one Team member , a competent gal named Shai Verent . A Pirr she thought was comatose made one last effort and stabbed her through the throat . We lost six of the hundred in emergency support  --  every one killed by a dying Pirr . And the fires began . The Pirrs made no secret of what they were trying to do . It took us a while to find out simply because we had only a little language in common , and no time to acquire more . What we did have , we 'd got through necessity and accident , and whether the whole race used one language like the Comity , or seventy-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were destroying their culture . It 's an ancient truism that , given printing and mass distribution , you ca n't wipe out every copy of any given work . The Clean Slate War should have wiped that one out , along with the works it did manage to erase ; but people still drag it out and display it for you , just as if it meant something . The Pirrs had progressed as far as microfiche and central library call , which made things easier for them . No book existed in six million copies , not even best-sellers ( if they had best-sellers ) : a few central libraries could display  | enough copies on home screens , page by page , to blanket the world . A few editions of new books may have been printed for the people who just like the physical feel of a book in their hands ; some printed books were around from the old days . But , if you could get to a few central libraries , you could do almost all of your job very handily ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist . Pictures and sculptures and the like were tougher to manage . The Pirrs did try to get rid of all those , too , but they were almost as devoted to such things as human beings are , and no fax reproduction is quite the same as the original  --  and there were millions of originals , covering all their recorded history . What we know about the Pirrs we know , mostly , because of the pictures and sculptures , and because of the bits and pieces our Team was able to bring back . And , of course , because of a few accidents . A book survived , here and there . Few of them seem helpful . We tried to explain to them that we were not enemies . We found out very quickly that they understood that . There had been enough time to spread the word about the cause of the plague . They were n't destroying their whole history out of some vague revengeful feeling that , at least , the Vibich would n't get hold of it . They bore no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shai Verent  --  the gal who got stabbed  --  got the answer at about the same time as I did . She was recording , of course . The whole Team was using throat-mikes hooked to continuous-recording setups in our orbiting home ship , which is standard for Team work as long as there 's a ship overhead . Shai 's discovery was being dictated while I was talking with a Pirr who seemed to be a Respected Elder , as nearly as we could judge age among the race , or re- spect . He was alone in one hell of a large house , and very ill , and he was occupied with trying to burn a houseful of paintings , and smash a few sculptures , when I happened in . There was not much we could do on Wankor , from beginning to end . There are basic support measures for any mammalian oxygen-breathing race , and the Pirrs were mammals . But the word is " support " : we could make their last days and hours easier , and that was about it . Trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race , suffering from a disease neither they nor human beings knew a single thing about , is a moron 's form of gambling . One Team member , a born idiot named Ferenc Goss , did start giving out medication on a pure-chance basis : his notion was that , my God , it could n't hurt , and who knew ? It might help . Which sounded as if it made sense . But he killed three out of five Pirrs . The course of the disease was fairly constant , and in those three it never had a chance : they took their medicine and keeled over inside of ninety minutes . Goss became the only human being to wait out the plague inside the home ship , in orbit . We sent him up in the landing-ship , and remoted the lander on back . The two Pirrs he did n't kill died anyhow . One of them died of the plague , as far as we could tell . The other seems to have died of a combination of plague and medication . Given all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd come upon . The most I could do was to make him comfortable ; but I was willing to do that . He took what I gave him , calmly enough . By then I had a few words of his language . It shocks the Hell out of me , when I think about it now , to remember that he had a good many words of mine . My guess is that the Respected Elder , at the very least , deserved the respect .  | We managed to talk after a fashion . Smoothed out a little : " You should rest , " I said . I 'd wrestled him to bed by then , away from the few things he had n't already destroyed . " I must complete this , " he told me . His voice was very hoarse . All Pirr voices were hoarse . Whether they 'd been hoarse before the disease , we simply do n't know . " This ? The destruction ? " " Nothing can be left , " he said . " Nothing . Soon we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work must come first now . I 'd asked him for his name , and he 'd refused to give it to me . That was standard , too . They had names . They never told us one of them . I said : " Sir  --  some may survive . " " Some survive any illness , " he said . " But not this . It is alien : we can have no defense . We can have no survivors . " " But ? " " We will pass , " he said . " We understand that . Therefore , all must be destroyed . " I said : " Why ? " He said : " Would you have us left open to you ? Open to strangers ? " He died during the night . I went on working  --  easing things for the few I could reach , for the little time we had . Watching the destruction . And beginning to understand what the old one had meant . It was a matter of privacy . Most races have some concept of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a war between the demands of privacy and the demands of contact with other members of the race . There are races that can reproduce themselves without direct contact . There are no races that can accumulate and pass on any sort of learning without it .  | The way the privacy war is settled varies from one person to another , but it varies between fairly strict limits for a given race . Human beings , for instance , make a great deal of noise about privacy , but settle the war , generally , in favor of contact . The ease with which most people can slide out of a libel suit is one indication of that . The whole notion of public news , by 3V or fax or any other method , is a larger indication : in a more private world , news ( if any ) would n't have so many names attached . We 're tribal animals . Contact seems to be more necessary than privacy , for most of us , most of the time . The Pirrs were a little different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , libel dies with its object . If I make a large , public statement that someone ? you , for instance  --  has poisoned six wives and is plotting treason in his spare time , I may get dragged into a court , and I might even be convicted , and have to pay money , or serve a term  --  or one each from both groups . But if you die today , and I make the same statement tomorrow  --  I ca n't be arrested . You ca n't libel the dead . For Pins , the rules were different . The law protected you , dead or alive . Suppose I publish your private papers . Bingo : there I am , arrested again , and with a much better chance of getting convicted . But if some archaeologist turns up Shakespeare 's private papers  --  or the private papers of anybody far enough back so there are no heirs to profit from publication  --  the papers appear in print at once , and nobody even considers this fact odd . For the Pirrs , privacy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't destroy most of his papers before death , there were still rules about publication to protect him ? rules that specified what could be published or even read ,  | and were enforced just as strictly for papers two hours old , or a thousand years . This slows down progress a little , maybe  --  but only a little . Most of the work that means progress is meant to be public . The rest is mostly gossip  --  which we love , and which seems to have been a damned severe crime , for Pirrs , even if the gossip dealt with their equivalent of CroMagnon Man . More : for total strangers  --  for other races  --  everything was private . Given a few hundred years more , that might have changed a bit . They 'd only begun : we 'll probably meet some other race the Pirrs made contact with , though we have n't yet . Enough contact might have loosened them up some . As things were , though . . . Well , when a Pirr died , he pulled the hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ninety-five per cent of any published Life of  --  did n't exist . Other material was left available for future Pirrs . And when the entire race knew it was dying " Wait a minute , " Freiburg said . " You mean  --  there 's nothing ? " " A few paintings , a few sculptures . Some pages here and there , saved by pure accident . Two hours and a couple of minutes of something the scholars call music  --  also saved through an accident . Nothing else . It 's all gone . " A silence . " But they might have had ? " " They might have had anything , " I said . " Things we need . Things we could use . New directions in any science . New sorts of medicine . Even an idea or two about ethics . Or theology . There is n't any limit . " He stared at me . ( The waiters were staring , too . We 'd  | been sitting there for a long while . ) " It 's  --  I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the loss , " I said . " The loss is the race . If you ca n't mourn for the Pirrs themselves , then mourn for this : we 've learned something new from every new race we 've ever met . Because races are as different as people are . It is n't the new facts or notions we need most ; it 's the new way of being . What would the Pirrs have meant to us ? " He was still staring . " We 're never going to know , " I said . After a while  --  a long while  --  he said : " But the Samaritan Rule ? " " Right , " I said . " Now : there are human beings , not many but some , who feel about privacy the way the Pirrs did . We 're a race with a lot of possible attitudes ; the Pirrs seem to have had only the one . So  --  we were the good Samaritans , right ? We stopped off to help . We did everything we could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we could . " " Right , " he said . " And we helped . We did help . But ? " " The one thing that is absolutely certain , " I said , " from everything we found out , and everything we 've been able to find out since  --  there are even scholars who think we 'll be able to read those pages we saved , some day  --  the one certain thing is that the Pirrs would much rather we had n't stopped off " He opened his mouth , shut it , and then opened it again to say : " But ? " " Some people will feel that way , too , " I said . " Make your rule nice and kind  --  tell a Samaritan he absolutely has to stop and help  --  and , never mind any other complications , you guarantee that you 'll be forcing some people to take something they truly do not want . " " But  --  the others ? " I sighed . " Nothing prevents a Samaritan from stopping , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free  --  nobody is  | forced to do something he does n't want to do , to someone else who does n't want it done . " After which , there was a flurry of words , and then another silence . And then Freiburg said : " But after all he can be sued ? " " Sure , " I said . " Improper treatment . And that makes sense , too . " " I do n't see ? " he said . I got up . " Remember our born idiot ? " I said . " Improper treatment . He killed three intelligent beings , and we stopped him . True , we did n't have him sued ; maybe we should have . " He got up and fished for check-paying cash . His expression was wondering what he 'd have done if he 'd been on the Team that had n't managed to help Wankor . I did n't think he was going to ask me about Survivor training any more . I gave him a reassuring sort of smile . I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spin a yarn , give me a little historical background , so to speak . . .  | This one still strikes me ( as I suppose it should ) as the only reasonable explanation of UFOs , flying saucers , and the like . Analog , which ran it originally , ran an illustration with it that ( I am told ) is a fairly good picture of a Kelan . Cartoonish , but fairly good . TESTING This one is three hundred years old , and if it were n't for the Anniversary you would n't be interested . And I would n't be telling it , because I 'd have better things to do . As it is , though , this is a footnote to history  --  no , make that History : why not ? ? and I have permission to open it up , after all this time . It seems that somebody up there , about three hundred and fifty light-years from home base , happens to like me . Do n't ask me why , unless it 's because I fit their notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I fit my own notion , too  --  and so do they . There are a lot of odd types , human and otherwise , floating around inside the fairly small volume of space we 've managed to figure space-four routes in , so far , most of whom are not , by my handy measurement , intelligent . ( If you 'd like to try measuring friends and neighbors , you can begin with Knave 's First Rule : Never give information away free if there is the slightest chance that somebody might be willing to pay for it . Human or non-human , two legs , six or none , I do n't know one being in a thousand who 's heard * by Leo Summers .  | of that rule , let alone tried following it . The ones who have , I value . Highly . ) But the Kelans meet my standard . Hell , they meet every standard I 've ever heard of , and probably a small pile of standards nobody has come up with yet . If there really are any Wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or beings we 've never met . You 've run into Kelan types on 3V all your life , despite its being a fairly tough makeup job  --  always showing up in the last ten minutes to hand out what the writers seem to think of as Words to Live By . You may even have run into a Kelan or so : they 're not standoffish , and once you get used to chatting with a teeny green midget who has arms growing out of his ears ( as well as the usual-human pair ) , they 're good people to be around . And , as I say , they do seem to like me . Well , I did them a favor once  --  which involves a Princess , a glass slipper , and a Fairy Godfrog , and is a whole other story  --  and , as payment , the Kelan Advisor-forOther-Races tossed me this story , permission to retell included . As part-payment , I ought to say : there was also a small purse of actual gold , not subject to Comity tax  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to payment , so does yours truly , Gerald Knave , Survivor . The small purse sustained what I like to think of as my normal lifestyle for some time ; now , with the Anniversary , this story might just sustain it a little more . Hell , if it does n't , I 'll have to go back to work , busily Surviving on one unpleasant planet or another  --  so it is definitely worth the chance . All the same , it is a chance : you might not take to this one at all . The Anniversary of humanity 's first extraterrestrial landing is one thing , and a story all about flying saucers is distinctly something else . I mean , flying saucers make a couple of small paragraphs buried in the histories of that age , and everybody knows they were a combination of mistaken sightings and mass hysteria . They were  | about as real as those pink elephants long-time drunks are supposed to see . In other words : strictly imaginary , and totally unimportant . Right ? Wrong . It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the Kelans constructed them , manned them , and spent thirty or forty Earth years making sure they were sighted and reported . And they had a reason ? perfectly obvious , once you 've heard it , but a reason nobody ever did come up with , back around moon-landing time ; if somebody had , the whole space program might not have gone into the decline that put a pall over the 1970s and early 1980s . That was the Kelans ' doing , toomental-emotional influence is a specialty of theirs , though they use it only when they feel that it 's absolutely necessary . There would have been some sort of outcry about the space program ? " Why not spend the money here on Earth ? " is an obvious , if idiotic , battle cry ; if you want to toss anything into space , you have to spend the money on Earth to start with , do n't you ? ? but that outcry would n't have had the force or the awful influence it did have , during those years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their saucer-work ; and maybe the easiest way to tell this one , most of the way , would be by transcribing a sheaf of memos from the Kelan in charge of the program at this end , directed to the Kelan opposite number , back home . Not that they had memos ; as I say , they 're an intelligent race . But shaking things down into a set of memos makes it Earth-comprehensible ; God knows that , in three hundred years and with a magnificent , showy and fairly well-organized Comity of Planets , we have n't advanced anywhere near the non-memo stage . In fact , there are times when I think the whole thing is a plot by the manufacturers of fax sheets and  | communications equipment . If you laid all the memos issued by the Comity , only for Home Worlds use and only for one standard year , end to end , you 'd have the longest , most useless off-yellow brick road in the known universe . And half the damn things would say Cancel previous memo ; they always do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saucer program was over thirty years old by then , which provided time enough for the Kelanin-charge at our end to get very truly bored indeed . January 2 , 1980 ( Earth AD ) From : Wheem , in Earth orbit* To : Freek , Kela-Orbital Base* Subject : Program continuance This is not , repeat not , an official document . Let 's be frank ; you pulled a string or two and got me this assignment , and it might mean a few toes up , and I 'm grateful . But , as one old friend to another , it is damned well time to register a complaint . This program has accomplished its stated purposes . We are stuck out here , far from groupings , friends , and even the normal amenities of civilized life  --  in thirty-three Earth years ( equals seven and an eighth normal months , friend ; I wo n't put you to the trouble of doing the conversion ) , we have had to do without even half-surround feelies , let alone gamma massage . Sure , we knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were prepared to go without for as long as we had to . But we do n't have to any longer . The answer to our basic query is perfectly clear by now . * These names have been invented . I have not used the actual Kelan names , partly out of respect for the Kelan race , and partly because I have no idea what the Hell they were . G.K.  | According to our best semicomputers , we 've got a fairly long-term No here , probability 0.884 . And 0.884 is as good as we 're going to get ; what the Hell do you people want back there ? Unity ? A continuing ban on extraplanetary travel can be established with automatics ; we can recheck in a hundred Earth years or so ; and , meanwhile , we can all get back home . You know the procedures . We 've been " appearing " to a wide variety of subjects , mostly non-scientifically connected , in farm , small-town or otherwise comparatively isolated locations . We monitored response both for immediate and long-term attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hysterics , through the choosing-up of sides , to the current balance between deliberate ignorance and fervent , absolute faith . The latest sampling is forwarded herewith ; these are your basic figures : Are there such things as UFOs/ " flying saucers " ? ( Both labels continue current ; analysis of this labelling is enclosed . ) Yes : 36% No : 54.2% Sometimes ( i.e. , respondent 's choice of reports is accepted as valid , no rationally defensible pattern of choice being present ) : 7.4% Do n't know : 2.2% Inappropriate response : 0.2% This last category includes , as usual , all those whose relation to reality is so tenuous , due to age or mental/ emotional condition , that a response can not be meaningfully calibrated  --  such replies , if I may translate a few into Language , as : " I am the King of the World and ca n't be bothered by such details , " or : " I am sexually attacked by them every Friday evening , directly after sundown , but at other times they do not exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed and concrete in their responses , even in this category , though there are no significant percentage differences from other surveys ; again , detailed analysis is enclosed . Now , I ask you : does n't that list establish a No as definitely as the program ever requires ? If you doubt me , Freek , semicompute the thing for yourself ; your facilities , God knows , are a good deal better than ours , out here at the edge of the wilderness . Frankly , Freek , I 'm tired . And so is the rest of the crew here . Even the semicomputer banks seem to be slowing down a little , which is not at all a good sign . Ca n't we write this one off as a No then , and jump on back to civilization ? Wheem 6.16.16 , 980 ( II ) From : Freek , KOB To : Wheem , on assigned duty Subject : Assigned duty  --  continuance thereof Very well , old friend , we 'll keep this unofficial ; why put your bulb on the block simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much too clear ! ) you 've gone a little native ? I put your data ( including that lengthy and confused analysis of the inappropriate-response group ; please , dear Wheem , do n't try to bury me with data ) through semicompute , not once but three times , using three separate mind linkages for my circuits . Either your equipment is a good deal worse than it ought to be  --  which I sincerely doubt  --  or you 've begun to let wishful thinking color your data input ; the best I get is 0.7 ? nothing like your hopeful 0.884 . And that 0.7 is the best ; the lowest figure my processing provided was ( expectable , after only seven months ) a simple 0.595.  | No , old friend : try a little self-examination , and get rid of those native tendencies . What you 're suffering from is that very common disease of nonspace beings , " impatience . " Take another look at your figures ; take another look , for that matter , at the entire project . That may effect a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I continue to wish you the best , and hope for the earliest possible termination of this project ; after all , it 's just as boring for me , stuck in an office interpreting results , as it must be for you . The whole UFO-test process is a damned bore , and we all know it  --  but I 'm afraid we 're stuck with it , for now . Freek 7.16.16 , 980 ( II ) From : Wheem , still on useless duty To : Freek , KOB Subject : Rational Analysis of Data Put those results through semicompute again . I think you 've got a degenerate mind in one of your linkages , or worse  --  no surprise , with all of Kela to distract you , and nothing like our stubborn insistence on making the machinery work properly . Unless it does , we ca n't wrap up the project here . And that , dear Freek , is a stronger motive than anything a tame , homebound administrator would know about . In the past four ( Earth ) days , we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " each , as usual , contradicting others in noticeable degree . The " sightings " were ( check your maps and lists ) at Chillicothe , Rabat and Quemoy ; the " meetings " were in Karachi and Midway Island . There has been minimal notice of these events on a planetary scale ; we are experiencing an expected trough in reportage , which will be followed , in eleven or twelve Earth months , by the usual rise  --  if we must still be here to  | chart it ! We have , however , been able to check responses among those who have been informed of any of the events , or , of course have experienced them . The Do n't Know percentage is 3.01-well within the limits of error , and confirming my last report . Probability for this figure , according to our very best semicompute , is now 0.899 , which I feel is nothing less than spectacular . Close the place out . Mark it No . Please . Wheem 8.16.16 , 980 ( II ) From : Freek , KOB To : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Data ( ! ) Spectacular , Hell . The word is " unbelievable . " Freek 9.16.16 , 980 ( II ) From : Wheem , on duty To : Freek , KOB Subject : Patience , Fortitude and Obedience Very well , old friend . Calculation , done with the greatest care and perspicacity , means nothing . Friendship itself means nothing . We are to remain here until Hell , apparently , turns into an Ice-IV skating-rink . And this , in spite of the fact that we have clearly established the basis for a decision ( probability , I insist , no less than 0.88 ! ) : Over 97 percent of these beings are convinced , without serious doubt , either that our UFO / " saucers " exist , or that  | they do not exist . Less than 3 percent retain any noticeable uncertainty in the matter . My dear Freek , what else is there to say ? However , we will continue to create events , and interpret results , until someone back home  --  somehow , old friend , I doubt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these barbarities . What else is there to say ? Wheem and , more likely , the reason for the very sudden change in percentages which did occur within less than twenty standard years ought to be laid out here . Most of you will have figured the thing out for yourselves by now ; to begin3with , what other motive could those UFOs have had ? For the record , though . The two different sets of figures were based , it turned out , on two slightly different assumptions  --  and humanity is fairly lucky that the Kelans dug that out soon after their " exchange of memos . " Wheem and Freek were both right , and they were both wrong . As long as we were restrained from space exploration , any real percentage change was unlikely as hell ; once we 'd had a real taste of it , far enough away from " local planetary conditions " to stumble over space-four , that change was just about certain . Wheem was right about us , as a restricted race ; Freek was right as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid dose of space exploration rubbed our noses in the single most important fact of the real world , and we have n't forgotten the lesson . Uncertainty , of course . Most intelligent beings spend nearly all their time in a  | condition of very real uncertainty ; Unity just does n't occur , and a probability of 0.99 is a good deal rarer than even a memoless bureaucrat . It is a lot easier , and a lot less wearing , to live as if this fact were n't so  --  and , before the Kelans lifted their ban , most human beings did live that way  --  until the probabilities caught up with them , of course . ( They really did . Read your histories ; better yet , read your preSpace fiction ! ) Either there were UFOs , or there were n't ; a human being might remain uncertain for some small while ( say , a standard year ) , but not , usually , for any longer . Then , one way or another , he made up his mind . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ability to live , function and remain reasonably sane , under conditions of continual uncertainty , is the final ability needed for any space-faring race . The probabilities , in any space-four jump , are awfully good ; but they remain probabilities , and any pilot , passenger or theorist had better know it . ( The same goes for the probabilities of any Earth-based event  --  but that fact is less obvious . No event is a certainty , until it 's happened ; no conclusion is defensible with inadequate data ; but it takes space-four , where small probabilities , and unlikely data , have to be taken into account to try predicting any human action whatever , to drive the point home . ) As long as most of us were sure , one way or another , about those UFOs , we were labelling ourselves Unintelligent , in large red letters . It is not easy to live with uncertainty  --  but , then , it is not easy to live , period . Ask any Survivor . Happy Three Hundredth Anniversary , everybody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we collapse into the easy life , ever again , friends , we might just find ourselves back on one small , inadequate planet . Which would suit me just as badly , I am sure , as it would suit you . Not much , really . That basis for decision might need a little explanation  | People seem to like this one more than just about any other Knave story . I 'm not sure why . I 'm fond of it , but prefer others . Maybe it 's Knave 's feeling that the causes here are worth major effort . Maybe it 's the lovely oddity of his solution . People hate this one , too . Most of this latter group consists of members of what Knave calls FemLib . They write me angry letters telling me how terrible my opinions are . ( a ) They 're not mine , they 're his . ( b ) They 're also not terrible . Fanatics tend to be funny by nature , and this is true regardless of the cause . TOADSTOOL SINFONIA Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like killing people . Death , as somebody or other has said , is so final ; and , though the usual picture of a survivor is the 3V sort of thing  --  beamers blazing , swords and axes , slug guns , and a pile of corpses around finale time that includes most of the available cast  --  a survivor is primarily an information collector . Surviving is being able to lay your hand on the right fact when needed , and since you will never know what the right fact is until the need arrives , you look , and you listen , and you keep yourself informed . There is comparatively little information to be gotten out of a dead man . Killing people , you might say , is not my thing . Of course , there are exceptions . Equally of course , I do n't spend all my time grimly Surviving , so to speak . My major aim in life is continuing that life , but what sort of life would it be , I ask you , if it were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes ,  | the wonders of science and the marvels of art ; when I have time , and I can usually make some , I gather just as many rosebuds as I can . Though even rosebuds , I 've discovered , have their troubles now and then . One afternoon , for instance , on Apelles  --  ever heard of Apelles , by the way ? Probably not . It 's an out-of-the-way planet , classified as a frontier world but a long way from rude huts and alien savages . Apelles is about twenty percent artists ' colony , which is a fantastically high ratio ; the rest of the world is pretty much like your average , dull , urban nightmare , but the place has six symphony orchestras  --  live music , purely-by-hand instruments , not an electric circuit in a carload  --  fifteen book publishers , a wearying number of art galleries and the painters and sculptors to match  --  well , you get the idea . So , one afternoon , I was sitting poolside in the very luxurious Apelles Hotel Dome , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was Marietta Jink , and she had long hair the color of anybody 's warmest midnight , a face like a largeeyed elf , and a figure I wo n't describe : statistics can not do Marietta anything like justice , and if you think about her for a while you run out of adjectives . Definitely a rosebud , and a highly talented one  --  first-chair , second violin section at sixteen , concert-master at eighteen , and full conductor of the Williamson Philharmonia not even two months past her twentieth birthday . She 'd spent a year as a conductor . The trouble was that she had very few hopes of spending a second year  --  at least , not with the Williamson . " We 're good , " she said . " You know that , Knave  --  we 're as good as any orchestra on Apelles , maybe better , and we outclass anything I 've ever heard offplanet . " " Then you ought to be surviving without trouble , " I  | said . We were drinking gimlets , as I recall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to great sympathy and clarity of mind . " There may not be enough audiences for all the concerts on Apelles , but if you 're that good  --  and you are , I caught your Strauss Memorial the other night ? you ought to be drawing more than your share . " She took a cautious sip of the gimlet . Marietta distrusted all alcoholic confections ; I think she felt they might sneak up on her and destroy her sense of timing . " We do , " she said . " But audiences do n't pay an orchestra 's way ; they never have . It takes funding  --  patrons , foundations , all that sort of thing . Any orchestra runs at a loss ; it has to , it 's a luxury item . Especially one like ours  --  Knave , do you know what violin strings cost these days ? " I did n't , so she told me . I turned pale . " And that means I have to pay my string section enough to let them live , buy their own strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a while . It mounts up ; live handmade music is getting more expensive every year , and we just ca n't afford it any more . " She shook her head slowly . I did n't suggest trading her hundred and forty-four musicians in on a couple of synthesizers ; it is n't the same thing , and we both knew it . " Well , what about Williamson ? " I said . " The original grant should have been enough to ? " " To run an orchestra for fifty years , " Marietta said , and took a slightly larger sip of gimlet . I was stretched out toasting myself in the artificial Sol that overhung the AHD pool . Marietta was sort of scrunched up in a deck chair next to me , shaking her head and looking miserable . Skin the color of very good coffee with a fair dose of authentic top cream ; in that light , a sheen that made her look softer than any human being has a right to look . Unquestionably a rosebud among rosebuds.  | " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you , Knave , " she said , " everything 's going up . When the orchestra was funded , prices were  --  oh , maybe a third of what they are now . And the fund was invested and paying a solid eight percent . Now  --  after fifteen years ? the investment is paying six and a half , and prices have just about tripled . " I sighed . I stretched a little , and finished my gimlet , and shook my own head . " And Williamson would n't  --  no , of course not . " " Maybe he would have , " she said . " Maybe he would have topped off the fund with enough more so we could survive until things even out . Maybe  --  if he had n't gone off his own roof two weeks ago . You heard about that one ? " " I heard , " I said . " Went into the files as an accident . I gather his investments were n't even doing as well as the orchestra 's . " " These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that by this time somebody would have figured out what causes depression cycles  --  I mean , there 's supposed to be a science of Socioeconomic Statics ? " " Give it time , " I said . " In the long run ? " " In the long run , " Marietta said , " the orchestra will be gone , and I 'll be gone with it . There are n't many odd jobs for out-of-work symphonists these days , even if I wanted to go back to the violin  --  which I do n't . I might get an occasional guest date  --  I might even manage to hang on , one way or another , until we even out , two or three years from now  --  but it is n't the same . The Williamson  --  God damn it , Knave , the Williamson is a fine orchestra , and Tarn Williamson was a fine man , and I 'm not going to let it happen . We 're going to survive . " I mean , Marietta never swore , but never . " Admirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Well , " she began , and stared for a minute , and then let her breath out in one long final sigh . " The practical man , " she said a little wryly . " With the practical question . To which there is , very simply , not an answer in the world . Knave , I do n't know how  --  but it is n't fair . It  --  just-is n't ? " I got up . Marietta was about ready to take in the rest of her gimlet , glass and all  --  that or go into the pool with it and forget she 'd ever learned to swim . I went to the chair where I 'd hung my robe , fished around in a pocket , and pulled out a card . I handed it to her while she was still building up steam , and she stopped , and looked at it , and looked back up at me . " What is this ? " she asked me . Her voice was uneven . " Business card , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them before . " " Damn it , Knave ? " Twice in one day ; this was a very , very troubled sample of rosebud . " Of course I 've seen ' them before . Gerald Knave : Survivor . What does your card have to do with me  --  with any of this ? " I looked at her confidently . It 's a look I do rather well . " I just wanted to remind you , ' Ette  --  that 's my profession . Surviving . " She was still staring at me . " And if a deserving organization like the Williamson needs to survive  --  well , that might be where I come in . " She blinked . She finished her gimlet . " Now , wait a minute , " she said . " You really mean to tell me ? " " The orchestra will survive , " I said . " You have a professional 's word on it . " I thought of a detail . " By the way ? let 's call it the next three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything  --  musicians , staff , hall , copyists , the whole charge . " She told me . I turned pale again . She gave me a crooked smile . " A little too much , Knave ? " she asked me . I gave her the confident look again . " Do n't give it a  | thought , " I said . " I told you I 'd manage it . So I 'll manage it . All right ? " " Knave , " she said , " if you really could ? " " Of course I can , " I said . " My professional word . " And in all this , I tell you with complete honesty , I had no notion whatever of the way things were going to go . All I knew was that , if I looked around , something would turn up ; it usually does . This time , I began to see , it would have to be a fairly sizable something . But , after all , there were a lot of places to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontier planet during a depression . . . I told myself to Think Positively . Somewhere , by God , there had to be something I could use .. . And I had not even heard , as of that date , of Helliman Ulg , or Pram Island  --  or the Thought Machine . It just goes to show you there is some truth in the old sayings . Do n't ask for what you want , one of them goes . You might get it . But  --  for Marietta , to begin with  --  what else could I do ? Never let your business interfere with your living . I try to follow that old saying , especially since I think I invented it , but it 's easier when the business is wholly yours . The prospect of getting shot at , here and there , had not interfered noticeably with my enjoyment of whatever happened to be around . The prospect of Marietta 's collapse did . I was checked into the Apelles Hotel Dome , and I went on living there , toasting myself by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a damn bore ) , eating and drinking as well as possible , looking and listening because that is what I do all the time . But I was searching for a way out of Marietta 's difficulties , and nothing presented itself .  | The AHD had a few well-to-do boarders , and one crone in particular , who seemed to be wearing most of the jewel collection of the Comity Agreement Museum , caught my eye ; but even the most delicate lift would undoubtedly have resulted in shrieking publicity , and while I could certainly make an arrangement with a friendly fence offworld ; I could n't quite see Marietta accepting Tainted Money . She was n't the type , somehow . Now , if I 'd been able to persuade the crone to help support the Williamson orchestra . . . but art patronage was at a low ebb on Apelles . During a Depression some of the arts do exceedingly well  --  people buy paintings , for instance , the way they buy common stocks . But gifts to symphony orchestras do n't appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a good jeweler can coin money during a Depression , and on Apelles quite a few of them were doing so . But musicians are more the starving type . I did have one idea  --  totally illegal , very complicated and extremely hazardous . I got it after three solid days of mulling , and I did n't much like it ; but I was on my way back to my room to do some of the final mulling and begin to get matters in order for it  --  I was actually in the elevator  --  when a total stranger tapped me on the shoulder and asked me if I were Gerald Knave . Most people tap me on the arm . Most people are shorter than six feet . This one had my attention at once . It was a large elevator , and except for a small woman with blue hair and an unlikely-looking shedding dog we were alone in it . He almost made it seem crowded . He was nearly seven feet high . We 'd gotten on together , down in the lobby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  being in a more or less brown study at the time . He had blond hair and a craggy face and skin the color of  | Dutch chocolate . He had blue eyes , for God 's sake , and a build that reminded me of good statuary . He was wearing a kilt , a white polo shirt and sandals  --  the kilt was mostly green and tan , a clan I did n't recognize  --  and his voice sounded very smooth and very friendly . The elevator came to a stop . " I 'm Knave , " I said . " And this is my floor . " " Please , " he said , and put a hand on my shoulder . A very gentle hand , actually . " I 'd rather like to talk to you . My colleagues and I have spent a good deal of money ensuring that this encounter would take place . Please , Mr. Knave : let us not waste it . " Nobody that size has a right to words and cadences like that . I let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " where to ? " He gave me a smile that made me his friend for life ; he had one of those smiles . Marietta had one , too ; they 're rare , but I can think of worse occupations for a lifetime than collecting them . " Why not my room ? " he said . " Unless you distrust me ? You have no way of knowing who I am , of course , or what I represent . " True , and trust is not my middle name . Somewhere in that last balanced set of sentences the little old lady and her hairy dog had gotten off . I had n't even noticed . But I noticed now . If he wanted something , he was very , very good . I thought it probable that he could break me in two if allowed ; but I had no intention of allowing it , and he seemed much too relaxed for frenzied sport . It might be that he was legitimate , more or less , in which case I had the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , and I really did not like the idea I was beginning to arrange  --  and it might be that he had a small con of some sort going . In that case , accompanying him  | would be a distinct pleasure . If the con were big enough , it might solve Marietta 's problem there and then . Unfortunately , he was legitimate . Very . Charles Hutson Bellemand MacDougal , no less : B.S. , M.S. , Ph.D. , this and that and several of the other : full Professor of Molar and Molecular Field Physics ( at the age of thirty-one ) in Ravenal Scholarte , and do n't tell me you have n't heard of Ravenal . People who could n't point to Apelles if they were standing on its sun know all about Ravenal ; there may not be a better collegium in the strict sciences anywhere inside the known galaxy . He introduced himself , sort of diffidently , between the elevator and his room  --  a smaller room than mine , with not much view , and a good deal too crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He nodded as if he 'd expected that . Before he opened the door of that room he 'd convinced me . He had the papers , of course ; and any damnfool impostor would have the papers . He had the little oddments as well  --  a note addressed to him from the hotel , that sort of I , thing , stuck in his sporran . ( A sporran , if you need to know , is what a Scotsman wears hanging from his kilt . If you wear a kilt , and you 're not a Scotsman , you still wear a sporran ; a kilt has no pockets . ) And anyone would 've had the little oddments . The thing was , it never seemed to occur to him that I might doubt all the nice documentation . He knew who he III was , and the papers backed him up  --  and that was that . Nobody , but nobody , is as good as that . Not to  --  pardon the phrase  --  the educated , professional eye . I said : Doctor MacDougal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . ' He put a hand on the door panel . " Call me Mac , " he said , turning back and giving me a smaller version of one of those smiles .  | I felt as if I 'd had two more gimlets , too fast . " Knave , " I said . He nodded . " Come in , Knave , " he said . " There are a lot of people who want to talk to you . " There were : altogether too many . After about two minutes I climbed up on a table and waved my arms and called a halt . The six or seven people who had been talking subsided . I looked around the room . They came in all shapes and sizes . MacDougal was the largest , thank God . The others ranged from Evelina Dedrick , legal secretary and respected amateur in psychological mathematics , who was less than eighty pounds all told , with straw hair and bright , black eyes in an aging , paling face , to Fenner Muller Gabston , an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds heavier . Gabston was a distinct surprise ; I 'd thought he was back in the Comity Worlds , probably on Earth itself . He 'd won his Nobel Prize there  --  not socioeconomic statics , but psychological statics , a slightly more advanced field  --  and he did n't look the type to travel . He looked as if you 'd have to arrange a small hoist to get him aboard anything from a ground car on up . He wore preSpace Earth clothing , a tweed suit with a vest , and he was covered with cigar ashes . He was smoking one every time I saw him , and he had large gestures . An expansive sort . A likable guy , in fact . They were all likable , damn it ; I felt as if I 'd joined a good club . But it was still impossible to make any sense out of them if they all insisted on talking at once . I had them quieted down . I stayed on the table , looking down at the crowded mob . Everyone was supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass put in my hand within fifteen seconds after the door had opened .  | I 'd also had my back slapped eight separate times . Well , you always have to put up with something from your friends . They were all looking at me with respectful attention . " All right , now , " I said . " Dr. MacDougal here tells me that ? " " Mac , " he said . I gave him a grin . I hope it did for him what his had been doing for me . " Mac , " I said . " All right . Mac wants me here so that you can tell me something . But you ca n't all tell me at once . Can we take turns , or choose up sides , or how do you want to work it ? " Fenner Muller Gabston made a rumbling noise . " Quite true , " he said . " We must extend our apologies . But there is not much time . Ulg is not likely to wait upon our decisions . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , " I said agreeably . Gabston had the full lecturer 's manner , complete with frown and extra emphasis . But I thought he would probably know what he was talking about . " Go ahead . But begin with this : who is Ulg ? " " Helliman Ulg , " Gabston said . It was the first time I 'd ever heard the name . " But it is his line of research that is important , not his name . You see , Mr. Knave ? " " Knave , " I said , to soften the manner down a bit . He did n't soften . He gave me a tiny stiff bow . " Knave : very well , " he said . " Now , you see , if the usual n-space conformal mapping of the human mind is taken as the sum of D and E throughout normal range , it is then obvious by Hiller 's Theorem that a generalized summation can be made , to include any possible n-space grouping . Individuation of groups may still be derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the generalized grouping covers all possible states of the D and E variables throughout normal range . Outside normal range  --  let us say a summation for the same sets fully generalized ?  | there are uncertainties , but it would be unwise to pin our hopes on such matters : the uncertainties , as it were , cover uncertain ground . And within the normal range there appears to be no doubt : such a summation will give such results . " He stopped , exactly as if he 'd said something . I shut my eyes for a second . I do have a vague background in mathematics  --  physics , mostly just enough to tell me that I had no idea whatever what Gabston was getting at : The room had started up with murmurs  --  apparently arguing about summations outside normal limits , or possibly the variables D and E , whatever they were . I opened my eyes . I picked out Mac , and then looked round for little Evelina Dedrick instead . " Miss Dedrick ? " I began . " Ms. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nut . Well , some of my best friends , as the saying goes ; and there are a lot stranger religions going the rounds than FemLib . " Sorry , " I said . " Ms. Dedrick : can you put any of that into language an ordinary layman might understand ? " " Layperson , " she said . I suppose she said herstory , too . And personhole . And her shoes undoubtedly had soles and sheels . Intelligence has no reliable correlation ( as Gabston might have said ) with sanity . " All right : layperson , " I said . And I 'd picked her because she looked small and bright and helpful . " How about it ? " She thought for a second . Her nose wrinkled when she did that . I would n't have mentioned it for the world ; she 'd have mistaken it for a pass . " What Dr. Gabston means , " she said at last , " is that it is possible , in theory , to derive an abstract single group of functions applicable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity can be detected , and imposed . " I felt stupid . I 'd recognized Dedrick , Gabston and two others from 3V or paper news here and there ; it was an assemblage of giant intellects . And they had to be reduced to putting everything into words of one syllable , more or less , in order to communicate with their guest  --  me . On the other hand , I had n't asked them for help ; they asked me . I felt a little better , but not much . I said : " Sorry . Can you go over that once more , please ? I gather that it has something to do with mentation ? " " Persontation , " she said stiffly . " Indeed it does , Mr. Knave . It has to do with the activity of every brain in this room  --  every brain on Apelles  --  eventually , every brain in the Galaxy . " " Fine , " I said . " And what does it have to do with all that ? " MacDougal broke in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious beliefs were n't his fault . " Thought control , " he said . Sounded like something off the 3V . " No , Mr. Knave , " the Dedrick person assured me , " it is not some simple drama . Ulg has done the work  --  a method of true control now exists  --  or soon will , unless he is stopped . " I 'd come down off the table . I was sitting in a chair with my drink  --  which turned out to be weak Frontier Scotch and ice-water . I sipped at it now and then to reassure my hosts . Dedrick , Gabston , MacDougal and some others were gathered around , some sitting , some standing . MacDougal was cross-legged on the floor , looking even larger than I remembered him .  | " You mean  --  this Ulg person can take over your mind ? Any mind ? " " All minds within range , " she said tartly . " And the range is sufficient to cover Apelles . Then other machines might be built ? " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict science , " MacDougal said . Dedrick looked annoyed at the interruption , but let it go . " Sooner or later , somebody was going to come up with a set of field equations that meant something . " " But if Ulg  --  well , to begin with , how do you know what he 's done ? " That turned out to be an interesting story , if you have a strong stomach . Helliman Ulg had been a researcher dividing his attention between the seminars Mac was giving and the Gabston scholium . Nobody had kept very close track of him for a few years , during which time he 'd gained a brilliancy prize or two and impressed himself on all and sundry as a fine example of exceptionally nasty personality characteristics . Then , on the eve , apparently , of his being awarded a Professorship in psychological statics ( " No one liked him , " Mac said sadly , " but that sort of brilliance is hard to ignore " ) , he 'd disappeared . There were a lot of rumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit over the head , stabbed , beamed or otherwise gotten rid of by someone he 'd irritated just once too often . But the rumor that stuck was the one involving Pram Island . Theoretically , it was owned by the Apelles Corporation ? which is what they called the planetary governing body when they were n't calling it the usual nasty names one calls such things . Actually , it was an uninhabited lump of nothing-much out in Apelles ' major ocean , and there was  | a not-quite-obsolete Sovereign Title law on the Apelles books that dated from the real Frontier days . Ulg ( the rumor went ) had gone to Pram Island , inhabited it for the requisite time , and was now a Sovereign State , immune to the laws of the Corporation . He had somehow gotten himself a large gang of workmen out there , and he was building a large , novel device . Mac told me he 'd gotten worried . Ulg had struck him as a type with unfortunate potentialities  --  that 's how he put it . Mac was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft and flown over Pram Island . The place was domed . Not like the Apelles Hotel Dome , with a semitransparent temporary job for weather control and general pleasuring . It 's possible , these days , to run a fairly sophisticated analysis of an object from a fair distance  --  say , three miles . The dome really gave Mac the itch , and he came back with some equipment and ran one . The thing was made of the same stuff they make starship hulls out of . An atomic weapon would take care of it  --  it was n't as thick as your average starship hull ; could n't be , or the island would have sunk under it  --  but nothing short of that . A standard beamer would n't even make it sparkle , and slugs from a slug gun , even my pet reconstructed .44 Magnum automatic , would just bounce off . The rumor began to sound more and more plausible . Mac , and a few friends  --  Dedrick signed on around that time , as did some others ; Gabston and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of cruising the ocean here and there , not too near Pram Island and not too far . " No real problems , " Mac said ; " Ulg could make his own air , keep his own food and water supply , and never leave  | the dome . But there might be a little refuse , we thought . There might be something to give us a real lead on what the Hell he was doing under there . We were reasonably sure it was n't pleasant , and we had some ideas  --  but we wanted any facts we could get . " " Good , " I said . My feeling exactly . " Trouble was , " Mac said , " the refuse we got was n't exactly what we thought it might be . " It had been a body  --  a workman , electronics tech and molar mechanic , apparently judged dead and just shoved out of an opening in the dome for the ocean life to get rid of . His name had been Revere Tang , and despite appearances he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mac and crew ; whether it was good luck for Tang I would n't care to say . In spite of everything that could be done , he died less than twenty-four hours later . They were able to help with the pain , some , at the end . Tang had a story to tell , and he was determined to tell it . That interfered with most of the anaesthetics ; he waved them off and did his job . Ulg was building a thought control machine . Tang had n't realized it at first . He 'd hired on like the others  --  he was a good tech , accomplished and ingenious , and Apelles was , as I 've mentioned , going through a Depression  --  and gotten to Pram Island some time before the large dome went up . After that , nobody got on , and nobody got off . There were a few objections , and a few speeches from Ulg about duration-of-contract residence , and every possible facility , and relatives either already along or notified ; and most of the workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't many . And Ulg was paying high salaries . ( " He 'd never had the money , " Dedrick broke in . " We had to research that . He was being backed  --  a few people  | who had a very vague idea of what he was after , and thought they could  --  in the phrase ? ' do business ' with him . And a lot of the pay was simply marks on paper , too : he gave the workers credit books , but they were never going to get off Pram Island to cash them in . It was all very clear , when we got a look at it . " ) It took a bright and ingenious man to figure out what Ulg was up to ; he 'd split up the work sixty different ways , and then split up the splits . But Tang managed it . And when he got it through his head that Ulg was serious  --  that he was really going for total control of every mind on the planet , eventually every mind in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ulg 's cabin with a homemade beamer . ( Personal weapons distinctly not allowed on Pram Island , except for Ulg , as it turned out , and a small force of hired bullies . ) Amateurs . . . well , the beamer was taken away . And Ulg asked him why he 'd come with it . Tang told him . Maybe he had some crazy idea that he could talk Ulg out of his plan . Ulg , however , only nodded . He told his bully-boys to find out if Tang had talked to anybody else  --  or if he were representing a group of workers . Tang 's sort of reluctance had to be stamped out , and if it meant hiring some more workers , opening the dome temporarily and letting them in , and shutting the dome again  --  well , what had to be , had to be . The bully boys tried their very best . That 's the part that requires a strong stomach , since Tang was acting wholly on his own , and had been enough of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that statement could n't just be believed . They were enthusiasts . I wo n't describe it . It went on for two days and three  | nights . At the end of it Tang should have been dead . He was dropped out of a temporary dome opening as if he were . And  --  the big piece of luck for Mac and crew  --  he had n't been , and he 'd been found before he went under or otherwise succumbed . The local-equivalent sharks had scarcely touched him . Tang had never noticed them , what with everything else . He told his story  --  he did his job  --  and he died . God damn all amateurs ; but Revere Tang rates a salute all his own . He did his job . A good many people do n't . And he wrapped up the picture for Mac and company . The only remaining problem was what to do . I stared at them . " My God , " I said , " why ask me ? Go to the Corporation . Tell them ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Knave : you 've had some odd experiences . Put it you 're a little likelier than most to believe an odd story . Right ? " I sagged . " All right , " I said . " And even I thought it was a bit wild . But you have the proofs ? " Mac gave me that gentle smile . He stood up , stretching . I leaned my neck back to keep the smile in focus until it left his face . " Proofs ? " he said . " What , for instance ? " " Tang 's story  --  the dome  --  Gabston can provide the background ? " I got that far and shut up . Tang was dead , and the dome was just a dome  --  go ahead , find out what 's under it  --  and Gabston 's background was going to be less intelligible to the Corporation than it had been to me . " And the businessmen , " Mac said . " Not many , but a few ? actively backing Ulg , remember . They 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 'll use it . " " But your reputations  --  all of you ? " " Oh , sure , " Dedrick said . " All of us . Yes , indeed , Knave . Our reputations  --  our awards , our standing . After three or  | four years , they might mean something . They might tip the balance  --  after three or four years . I tell you , the crimes of this malefactor must be ? " " Personfactor , " I said , and shut her up with it . A small but warming satisfaction . Mac very nearly smiled again ; I could see him start , and decide that discretion was the better part of conspiracy . " Well , " I said into the silence , " how long have we got ? " " From what  --  Tang told us , " Mac said evenly , " I 'd say six months at the most . " " Four , " a young woman said  --  a stick of a girl named Wilviria Spodin , I 'd discovered , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . " Four , " he said . " And then ? " " And then , " Dedrick said , " the dome opens , and the waves begin to spread  --  and in thirty minutes our minds are not our own . And never will be again . " " When the pie was opened . . . " I murmured , and found them staring at me . " Sorry , " I said . " All right : four months . Then the Thought Machine starts up . So you drop a small atomic  --  barely tactical size , as they used to say ? on Pram Island , and you argue it out with the Corporation later . My God , it does n't take four months to make a tactical-size atomic bomb  --  and the knowledge to do it is right in this room . " " The money , too , " Mac said . " We 'd pay  --  well , any sum within reason  --  any sum within even inflated reason  --  to get that bomb . I do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . Dedrick stared at me . " But you ? " " My reputation , " I said . " Sure . But killing is not my sort of thing ; honestly . If there were some other way ? " " There is n't , " Mac said . " Agreed , " I said . " So you buy your equipment  --  Lord , what do you need but some nice U235 , a few tampers , a  | globe , beryllium reflectors , a fuse  --  and you go to work . Should n't take four months ; should n't take two . " Mac nodded and looked sad . " Sure , " he said . " We buy our U235 ? where from , Knave ? Do you know what Corporation inspection is like ? Do you know how Ulg 's pet businessmen have ? " " Businesspeople , " Dedrick said . I 'd wondered when she 'd get around to it . " Whatever they are , " Mac said . " Do you know how they 've beefed up that inspection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's dangerous  --  Ulg knows the weakness of his dome as well as we do , probably better . And in general ? " " In general , " I said , " you do n't get U235 into private hands . I agree . But  --  after all , a lot of you are major figures in science . Ca n't you mock up needs for your labs ? Some-thing ? " " Not enough , " Mac said . " It 's a difficult item to find an excuse for , and we need nearly three and a half pounds . We do have some , more than half of minimum need  --  but three and a half pounds is missing . We have n't got a halfway plausible story to requisition it , and we ca n't come up with one  --  unless you ? " I shook my head . " No such luck , " I said . " That 's a job I leave to the technical people ; any story I dreamed up would have as many holes in it as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if we draw suspicion to ourselves , " he said , " the whole thing goes down the drain . " " That , " Gabston chipped in heavily and cheerfully , " is why we greeted the news of your arrival on Apelles as a gift from the gods . An incredible piece of luck . " " Sure , " I said . " I may mention Haven II , " he went on . " And Cub IV . And ? "  | " Spare my blushes , " I said , lifting most of a damn graceful line from a preSpace author . " Whatever . You think I can do your job for you ? " " We think you can manage to get the U235 out for us , " Mac said . " We can do our own refining , on the spot ? we 've got a crew out there , and the richness of this ore is beyond belief ; we can use a sort of beam analog of zonemelting , and at nearly an eleven-to-one ratio ? " " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it refined and ready to go , out of the natural ore . But you ca n't take it anywhere . " Mac looked at me earnestly . " We would pay any price ? virtually any price . Believe me . But we need it here  --  in this city , where we can work with it  --  and we need it quickly . Knave , if anyone can do it ? " I looked them over . Mac , and Dedrick : a fair balance . Gabston the likeable , ashen with cigars . Wilviria Spodinnot my type , but why hold that against her ? And all the others . Including Revere Tang  --  of course including Revere Tang . I sighed . Deeply . " I 'll do your job for you , " I said . " My professional word . " I had no idea how  --  the basic uranium mining sources from which they were going to refine out the needed isotope were five thousand miles around Apelles from where we were sitting , and any obvious hijacking would tip our hand . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself ; something always does . I wondered briefly where I 'd been thinking that recently . I wondered , just as briefly , where I 'd given my professional word on something . Then I beamed all over my charming little face . " It 's going to cost you , " I said . " Beyond the price of the metal , it 's going to cost you like Hell . "  | " Money is no object , " Mac said . Nobody seemed to moan or faint . " If you can get us the metal ? " " Sure I can , " I said . " I may need to ask you a couple of questions ? " " Anything , " he said . " Anything at all , Knave . If you can really do this job for us ? " " Oh , I can do it , " I said . I still had no clear idea how , but one was beginning to form in the back of my head . Shortly , I hoped , it would be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost . " " Money  --  my God , Knave , what 's money ? " Mac said . " Let 's order up some more drinks . We can celebrate now , as a starter  --  and again when the job is done ? " " No drinks , " I said . " I 've got some work to do . " His face went sober . Frankly , if the drinks had been good , I 'd have chanced it ; alcohol is a help now and then . But weak imitation Scotch and ice water ? I ask you  --  is n't sobriety preferable ? " Of course , Knave , " he said . " Any help we can be ? " " One bit of help , " I said . It was a basic rule ; whatever I was going to do , it would stand . " Unless I recognize you , you do n't know me . Maybe we met vaguely once , had a drink together . But you do n't like me much . And you never mention my name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Just like that . " What good will that do ? If Ulg 's people have beams trained on us  --  pickup beams trained on us right now ? " " Dear lady , " I said , and watched her wince , " I 'm a Survivor : remember ? I carry two things at all times , in any costume  --  a weapon , and a field distorter . " I dragged out the weapon  --  my pet slug gun  --  and let them look at it . It created quite a stir . Dedrick was n't fond of it , which figured . " If they have a beam on us now , they 're picking up static , and they have been since I walked in . I suggest you shut up after I leave  --  instantly after I leave . "  | " Right , " Mac said . He gave the others a look . There were nods and murmurs . Amateurs ; but we might just make it . If I could think of the notion  --  the idea in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident than I 'd been looking as I went round the room shaking hands . ( Dedrick gave me a single shake , like a club signal or a cow-milking attempt . I bowed , held her hand and kissed it . Score one for sanity . ) And then I left . Cudgeling , as the phrase is , my brains . Somewhere , a perfectly obvious idea . After a while I went out to find Marietta Jink , my sad rosebud . We talked about orchestra schedules for a while . I gave her a good deal of the story , leaning hard on Revere Tang : I thought that would have an effect . It did : she turned paler than I was , after my days of toasting . She asked some technical questions , and I said I 'd get the information from Mac , or somebody . " MacDougal ? " she said , awed . " Charles Hutson Bellemand MacDougal ? Really ? You know him ? " " Well , I 've met him , " I said . " And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that I know you . " " Do n't be silly , " she said . And she blushed . It 's an interesting effect on that complexion . A sort of dusty light chocolate  --  cocoa mixed with powdered milk . ( I never do . It 's not a good idea . ) I gave her my very best grin . " For the Williamson , " I said . " For the human race , " she said . Well , she had me there . She was still being starry-eyed about Mac when I left her , with nearly everything settled . Five thousand miles is  | a good hop for an orchestra , but she could get it managed ; as a new conductor , with a lot of publicity , she swung weight even if the ship were sinking . And that single hop was all we were going to need . It was really ridiculously simple . Let me tell you , Mac 's picture of that inspection was n't exaggerated . If anything , he underplayed it . I mean , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a finetooth comb . But  --  leaving an area where U235 was even remotely available  --  the Williamson got the full treatment . Instruments checked  --  X-rayed for metals . Metal instruments , like the trumpets and such , Geigered and remote-analyzed . Luggage , personal effects , scores , music stands . . . even the two spare sets of strings . " What are these ? " a barrier inspector asked , with deep suspicion . " Spare strings , " the violinist in question said helpfully . " In case one breaks . We all carry a couple of sets with us . Perfectly ordinary , " he added . They were gone over . Mostly copper alloys , a little aluminum and steel . They were returned . " Hmf , " said the inspector . " And what about the music stands ? " " Ordinary stands , " Marietta said . " The same ones we 've used all season and the season before . " " And the harp . Some of the strings are colored differently . Why is this ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It gives you your location points . " " And you have ? " " Spare strings , " the harpist said . " Two sets . Here . " Copper , aluminum , steel . The inspection took about nine hours . At the end of it  | Marietta was exhausted , the orchestra was exhausted , and the inspectors were still suspicious . They had a final bright thought . " Your stick , " they said to Marietta . " Sticks . Three of them . " She handed them over . Ebonite , tipped with silver . I got the whole report from Marietta , later ; it was n't thought wise , by me or anyone else , for me to show up down there . We could take the one risk that the inspectors were n't knowledgeable music-lovers  --  for some reason , such officials seldom are , and it is probably better so for all concerned  --  but dropping Gerald Knave into the mix seemed a little too much . So I stayed at the Apelles Hotel Dome , and enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit , but she was a capable sort , and the orchestra well-trained . I had a fine few days  --  I even found a man who owned some actual coffee beans , and mixed and ground them to order . Made some great coffee . Mac and the rest loved it . And then the Williamson came on home for a final date ? passing an inspection at the home end as well , but a little more easily  --  and all was well . I would n't call the thing that sank Pram Island , destroyed Helliman Ulg and ( unfortunately  --  damn it , we had no way of avoiding that ) his work force , and wiped out the completed parts of the Thought Machine  --  despite tradition , I would n't call it a mushroom . A toadstool , really . I do n't like killing , and I do n't like atomics . . . as it happens , I like total thought control a good deal less , and that tipped the scales . But  --  yes , a toadstool . Killing innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it , but innocent people . . . Not a good , luxurious mushroom . A toadstool . Like Helliman Ulg  --  at whose door , I suppose , the  | deaths can really be laid . If you want to play that sort of game ; I do n't , and I 'll take responsibility for the omelettes I make and the eggs I ruin in the process . Mac feels the same way . So does Marietta ; they 've been seeing a lot of each other , I understand . Mutual comfort , no doubt . No doubt . Well  --  Apelles is full of lovely ladies . Dedrick and the helpful beanpole , Wilviria Spodin , did n't exhaust the list by any means . And I had all sorts of cash to toss around , which is always helpful . I got enough for the U235 to underwrite four years of the Williamson . And  --  after all , it 's a living  --  an equal sum for myself . As they kept saying , money was no object . To them  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's almost a shame to explain the method . I might use it again some time , some other world , some other problem . . . orchestras are such helpful things . You see , violin strings ( and viola strings , and cello strings , and bass strings ) are not made of metal . At all . Some harp strings are , and now and then a bass will turn up with its strings metal-wound  --  but that 's about it unless you count steel guitars . Personally , I never count steel guitars . They 're made of gut , mostly , or imitations thereof . But the spare strings were made of copper , steel , aluminum ... And got careful examination . The strings actually on the instruments were metal too , of course . Looked just the same . And passed simply as metal . I mean , if the spares were all right  --  it 's an odd thing , but it 's the way the human mind works . You can , it seems , draw out three and a half pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fairly fine wire . You can lead-coat it so it wo n't register on an average Geiger . And you can use it for violin strings . Viola strings . Cello strings . Bass strings . Harp strings . Damn it , if he 'd needed more I might have taken a real chance and used the trumpets . Or at least the metal keys on the clarinets and bassoons and such . But an orchestra full of metal strings was enough . We made the trade from U235 to usable strings right in the AHD , in my room , under a field distorter . And building the bomb took very little time . Four months ? We did n't need two . Finest concert the Williamson string section ever gave , in a way  --  a millionth of a second , for a small audience , on a small and sovereign island . The island does n't exist any more  --  but the memories do , good and bad . The toadstool sinfonia  --  the millionth-of-a-second symphony . " Accidental explosion due to experimental work , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightened . And after about four more days I could n't take it any more . Mac and Marietta were distinctly a Thing . Scratch one rosebud , damn it . Somehow , nobody else on Apelles looked quite the same to me . And it was just possible that a few businessmen might begin to develop a suspicion or two .. Oh , well : there are always other planets . " Never let your business interfere with your living . " One more old saying broken , or at least bent . But my bank account felt much happier , thank you . Shortly , I knew , so would I. And  --  my Lord , they gave me a sendoff ! More bad Scotch than you would ever want to see . I drank it  --  hospitably , gracefully , gratefully .  | I was especially fond of one detail : the looks Dedrick was giving Marietta Jink . Falling , as it were , from grace . I had n't really known she 'd been after Mac . . . But the thought made my journey offworld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Queen appear in this one , and this is during a period when they were re-elected , or whatever it is Tocks do ) also show up in the novel Knave in Hand , an Ace paperback .  | This is an adv . The reason for the adv. is that I really do not understand what makes Tocks tick ( sorry about that ) , and neither does Knave , and if anybody out there has an idea we would both be pleased as Hell to find out about it . If you can find Knave in Hand , and if it leaves you with any ideas , by all means write . The Tocks seem to be nice people . They also seem to be totally inexplicable , and this bothers me almost as much as it bothers Knave . THE SWAGGER STICK The Haven System is full of interest for the traveler or itinerant tourist . It 's one of the very few systems that contain three choice inhabitable planets ( they 're called Haven II , III and IV  --  the result of an imaginative leap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and one of them , Haven II , is inhabited by human beings . Haven III is inhabited , or infested , mostly by a sort of absolute monarchy and the court thereof , and a scattering of filthy slaves and peasants who have n't had the stamina to revolt and begin to become human . A non-interference clause in the tripartite Haven Treaty of 2101 prevents the people on Haven II from rectifying this situation . The inhabitants of Haven IV , as it happens , are snakes ? and very nice people , too . You tell people that Haven IV is a snake planet and they say " boa constrictor " or " python " with green horror  --  for some reason , they always respond with Earth snakes , though larger and worse forms exist :  | Sanderson has a ninety-foot version that drops out of trees and sandpapers you to death with its skin . And then you say that it is n't snakes , exactly , it 's more like lizards , and people say " alligator " with the same green faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't share it . I get along very well with the Haven IV snakes . ( They call themselves Tocks , and they have personal names and a well-organized , almost friction-free social system that would work very well for human beings , if we had the Tocks ' drives and motives instead of our own . Their police force , for instance , is a corps of fifty to seventy-five Tocks , to cover an entire planetful of intelligent beings , and at that they are n't kept terribly busy . Tocks are good people  --  they do look snakelike , with centipedelike legs that can fold up into the body and be covered , tail to head , by a hard folding carapace if they happen to feel like it , so that they can either wriggle or walk around for a bit and then go totally rigid on you ; their idea either of a rest or of a practical joke , and God alone knows which . If their planet was n't so damned cold I 'd spend more time there than I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the non-prejudiced samples of Haven II people . Nobody gets along with Haven III people . Until things change , they all seem to figure , who 'd want to ? That , at any rate , was the situation when I hit Haven IV to talk over old times with Nassanank , their Head Snake , and spend a few days before heading on to other places that sounded more exciting . I 'd had my excitement on Haven IV  --  some business about the Crown Jewels , which are n't jewels and look damned weird for a crown  --  and I did n't expect any more . And my business cards do read : Gerald Knave : Survivor . Every so often , even if a Comity world or a frontier world is n't hiring me , I feel like proving out the title all over again .  | It 's an interesting profession . The argument can be made  --  and I 've made it  --  that it is the only important profession any intelligent being can follow . But being a professional Survivor , you see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the less likely it is to get you killed ; but the way you get to be professional in the first place is by not getting killed . Surprisingly few people want to start at the bottom . And there is n't any other place to start . Well , Haven IV . . . a few days , really , was enough . As I say , it 's a damned cold planet and I am fond of amenities in truly massive quantities . I was having a farewell chat with Nassanank and Jessiss , his consort ( a really precise translation might be " egg-warmer and main twiner , " but let it go ) when the subject of Hunar came up . " Even for a human being , " Jessiss said , " this Hunar seems to us most repugnant . He stinks like an empty egg at low tide . " " Jessiss ! " Nassanank did n't approve of women using strong language . She just shrugged ; if you 've never seen a snake shrug , you 've missed an interesting experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " I do not understand why something is not done about him . " I started to explain the non-interference clause in the Treaty . Nassanank gave a deep , heartfelt sigh and said : " Knave , I could wish that we had not entered on this subject  --  times with old friends should be pleasant . " But look at him ! " Jessiss said . " Here he coils " ? I was seated lotus-position , actually , which seemed close enough ? " calm , relaxed , planning his next excursion into pleasantries  --  while something like this Hunar struts and swells as Emperor of an entire planet ! Knave is not bound by this stupid Treaty ? " " It is n't stupid , " Nassanank said patiently . " It 's necessary . In no other way could ? "  | " Lectures ! " Jessiss said with finality . A great woman ; and a damned fiery one . " And he is n't an Emperor , " I put in soothingly . " He 's a Grand Seigneur vested with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ label . " " And inside the package ? Is there any difference ? " I shrugged . Human-fashion , which is not so spectacular . " I suppose not . " " And you are not bound by this Treaty  --  are you ? " " Well . . . " I said . " Well , indeed ! " Jessiss hissed triumphantly . ( Tock talk is full of hisses . I suppose it would have to be . ) " Why do you sit here in comfort , rather than doing something about this Hunar ? " " Doing what , for instance ? " " For a starter , " she said without a pause , " killing him . I 'm sure you could go on from there . " " But some other Grand Seigneur would just take over ? " Jessiss gave me an impatient snort that seemed to start at the tip of her tail and travel all the way forward in one ripple . " Perhaps , " she said . " And perhaps , in the confusion , there might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunar 's population of slaves . Tell me this , Knave : can the situation on Haven III be any worse than it is ? " " Well , " I said , " if you put it that way ? " Nassanank broke in high-handedly  --  so to speak . " Knave is here as our guest , " he said in a calmative tone . " Doubtless he has matters of importance to take care of on many other planets , in many other places throughout the inhabited galaxy . Jessiss : to prod him with this one problem  --  a problem that is none of his concern  --  when he is a guest in our home is worse than tactless . It is thoroughly impolite . It is unworthy of a Tock. "  | Strong words , and stern ones . Ever try arguing with a woman  --  Tock or otherwise ? Ever win , in the long run ? If so  --  do let me know how you managed , will you ? I mean , if you managed it without actually leaving the woman dead behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Not , I 'm afraid , very pleasantly , but respectfully . They knew I had a space-four pass , maybe the only unlimited one ever issued to a civilian , and they did n't want to irritate the Home Worlds by causing me any discomfort . On the other hand , they did n't want to irritate Hunar by making my stay on Haven III resemble any sort of perpetual round of joy . The result was that I went where I liked  --  within , of course , the usual tourist limits : no wandering in the poor sections of their cities , no talking with known dissidents , no peering at the gates around secret encampments , that sort of thing . And they pretty well surrounded me with what Hunar may have thought of , for all I know , as his Secret Police . They dressed in identical dark jumpsuits and they all bulged near one hip . Beamers , I thought : Imperial Police tend to go for the fashionable weapon anywhere , whether or not it 's any better , and beamers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns . I wore my very best  --  I 'm partial to preSpace British evening dress , severe black and white , after sunset , and as much variety as possible before then  --  and I spent a day or so sightseeing , visiting fashionable restaurants , and generally being On Holiday . I was still doing all that sort of thing when the news broke . On a planet like Haven III it would n't break on 3V or in the newspapers . Whatever came through such channels  | would be specially sanitized for a docile public , and sanitizing takes time . Rumor , however , is fast , cheap , and dependable . Within a very few hours , all of Haven III knew what was happening . Hunar 's life had been threatened  --  and the threat had mentioned the theft of Hunar 's own Crown Jewels . Those really were jewels , too : good stuff , worth fifty million Comity dollars in themselves , and only God knew how much as curios of the Hunar regime . Except on the other Haven planets , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyers . Now , Haven III had an Underground . There is always an Underground  --  it cooperated with equally Underground movements on II and IV , of course  --  and it is almost never any damned good . As this rumor began to gather momentum , a few of the ringleaders were hauled in for questioning , but in a half-hearted sort of way ; the sort of pinpoint planning that aims at the killing of exactly one man is not characteristic of Undergrounds , which tend toward the grandiose and unworkable , and the jewels just added confusion . Why ( if you were an Undergrounder ) steal them at all ? What could you do with them ? They could n't be sold in the Haven system , and an Undergrounder with real connections to some other system sounded wildly unlikely . The usual run of tourists was , sadly , just the usual run of tourists . The Secret Police , if that 's what they thought they were , took every imaginable oath that no tourist on Haven III had any contact whatever with any Undergrounder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As far as I have ever known , they were quite right  --  tourists including , of course , one Gerald Knave . Hunar looked over the reports and made the obvious  | move : he sent for me . This was accomplished by directing a Secret Policeman to come up from behind me ( he left no noticeable gap : there were always four or five back there , an equal number ahead , and a few to either side ; in some streets , and in most restaurants , it made movement difficult ) , and to whisper : " I am employed by the Grand Seigneur . I have been instructed to break cover ; I am a member of his Secret Service . " It was quite dramatic . " No ! " I said . " I would never have guessed . " He smiled thinly . Face to face , he was less likable than he had been as one of the crowd ; he had a long thin face , a drooping nose , pimples , and a slight squint . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the jumpsuit ; the weather was really too warm for it . Nobody but Secret Police wore the damned things . " We are efficient and well-trained , " he said . " We serve Great Hunar well . " " I 'm sure , " I said . " And what does he want with me ? " His uneven eyebrows rose in alarm . " What should he want with you ? " he asked sharply . " Have I said that he wants anything ? Have I given the impression of ? " " He instructed you to break cover , " I told him patiently . " There must have been a purpose behind the instruction . Clearly , he wants me to do something , or not to do it . You are supposed to tell me what that something is . All right : tell me . " The thin smile again . " Rumor does not exaggerate , Knave , " he said . " You are a man of high intelligence . " It had begun to occur to me  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that killing Hunar really might do some good . Of course , what held him in power was more than this comic-opera troupe , and quite a lot more ; but if the average level of the enlisted- man mentality , so to speak , was anywhere near what I was seeing  --  well , anything that removed the top man , and created a bit of confusion , might overturn the whole damned system . In which case , a new government being established , the noninterference provisions could ( by the new government ) be waived . . . Jessiss , I told myself , was a snake of remarkable perspicacity . My pet Secret Policeman , on the other hand , was just a snake . I made some sort of gesture intended to convey embarrassment at his great flattery of me , and he smirked a little , and we got down to business . " Hunar would see you , " he said . " At once . " " Fine , " I said cheerily . " Here I am . Whenever he gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here ? " he said in a rigid , shocked tone . " Have you not heard me ? He wishes  --  he will meet you in the State Palace . I am to escort you there . " " Well , " I said , " I did have plans for dinner ? " It was late in the day , and I was fully dressed : white tie , boiled shirt , cummerbund , knife-sharp trousers , swallowtail coat , top hat  --  I even had a silver-topped walking stick . I had practiced twirling it negligently , but had given that up and , mostly , was content merely to swing it a bit now and then as I walked . " They must be canceled , " the policeman said . " Come . " I looked resigned . At the same time , I hope , I looked respectful of Hunar the Great , and eager to be in his august company . After all , somebody was going to kill him and lift his jewels . And if he began to think he needed protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little preliminary respectfulness did n't hurt anything , and who knew ? It might help .  | It did n't , not so you could notice . Hunar But I have got to describe that State Palace first . I understand Hunar himself had it built , with local labor . He 'd seen no reason to stint on anything , and he had n't . It was in the center of an acre of green , real-Earth grass ? the rarest and most expensive carpet in the galaxy . There were no bushes , no trees  --  just the green , flowing away wherever you looked . And , in the center , there was the State Palace . It had domes , and spires , and mansard roofs , and minarets , and gargoyles , and stained glass . It had a full row of marble pillars at the front  --  or what looked like marble , and felt like it to my fingers  --  and smooth concrete arches , reminiscent of Saarinen and other ancient Modernist architects , round by the rides . The domes were mostly pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spires were granitecolored or gilded , the mansard roofs and most of the rest of the top was silvered , with occasional points or small spheres of red to break up the space ; the gargoyles were every damned color of the rainbow , and they jutted out from every side , under every arch , next to half the windows , and anywhere else they could find an odd bit of space . It was the only architectural construction I have ever seen that reminded me , forcibly , of a triple banana split . The main front doors of this confection were real wood , backed by real cold steel , and carved in designs and pictures of every sort ; by the time we reached them my eyes had nearly stopped taking in the stuff presented to them , and gone on strike . I have a vague , blurred memory of those doors , but that 's it . Inside was a different matter . The Great Reception Hall was what you 'd expect : three stories high in some places , four stories high in others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there  --  cavernous , filled with patterned carpets ( on the walls ) and ancient-appearing armor nearby with real-wood chairs that looked incredibly ancient scattered around , and a flooring that seemed to be , and maybe was , the very best Parian marble . The chairs , of course , were n't for sitting in . But the armor was for standing in : that Reception Hall contained fifteen guards , every one encased in a tin suit , and every one alert and on duty . They did n't move much , but I saw one shift balance , after we 'd been watching ten minutes or so , and from then on I kept my eyes hard at work . I saw no other defenses  --  no others being needed . After twenty minutes or so of standing in the Reception Hall  --  it was a bit drafty , as I suppose anything that size is going to be  --  I saw a very small man pop out of a door near the extreme left corner of the place . I recognized him from description and rumor : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed for Court Chancellor . I forget what Hunar called the post . Advisor Extraordinary and Superior to the Grand Siegneur sounds about right . He weighed maybe eighty-five pounds , and was at the very best five whole feet tall . He did n't walk ; he scuttled . He did n't talk , either ; his voice was a hoarse , mumbly , confidential rasp , combining all the worst features of age and secrecy . But at first he did n't do any talking at all ; he just scuttled out of the doorway back there , like a beetle with ceremonial robes on , and beckoned to us . My Secret Policeman ? I never did find out his name  --  bowed , and I followed suit , but I made it look grudging . Then we marched for the door , and got ourselves ushered into the Presence . Hunar , like many dictators , had a weight problem . He was just a little too fat .  | I mean a little too fat to be considered human . He weighed something on the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was flab . I realized that Hunar 's reluctance to come out into the streets and meet me was not based solely on a fear of assassins ; the logistics involved in getting all of him into motion would be complex . He had rings . He had rings the way my policeman had pimples  --  anywhere you could fit one in . With only ten fingers , he 'd managed to push on nearly thirty different rings . His clothing was silk , and glitter , and more silk , and more glitter . Name a color , he had it . His crown was on a cushion next to the throne . ( I wo n't describe the throne . I ca n't . Imagine the gaudiest thing you can , to sit on . Now imagine it made out of rainbowcolored bubble-gum . ) The crown had jewels on it , and jewels on the jewels , and just a few more on those . Every valuable sort of trinket the human race has catalogued was somewhere on that massive circle , and then some . All in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dali had made a sculpture of Oliver Hardy , playing Louis the Sun King , out of second-hand putty . ( Readers of this report without my interest in preSpace studies may feel a little lost here . Which is nothing to the way I felt , then and there . ) Stan Laurel  --  Billibin Plig  --  scuttled to his side . The throne was on a sort of dais , three velvet-covered steps up , and Plig stopped at the lowest step , and knelt . Just inside the door , my Secret Policeman did the same . I may have bowed a little , but I hope not . Hunar glared at me . He raised one fat hand , glittering , from the arm of his throne . " He kneels in My Presence , " Hunar said . There is no description of his voice that can be any better than this : it sounded just like him .  | I tore my eyes from the spectacle . The Throne Room was full of guards , too  --  not in ancient tin armor , but nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for use . Beamers , and knives , for some damned reason . A couple of them converged on me from their posts along the walls . I stepped forward one pace , and spread my hands toward them both : halt . " I am not your subject , " I said to Hunar . " I am someone who can aid you . But I must be allowed to do things my own way . " In My Throne Room , " he said , " all kneel . " The guards had actually halted  --  that motion seems to call up a reflex in human beings , and will generally give you a couple of seconds even in the worst cases . And these looked like anybody 's worst cases ; they were not twins to my Secret Policeman , by any manner of means . They started forward again . The reflex does n't work twice . I used my loudest and most impressive voice . " Wait ! " All motion stopped . I was addressing Hunar . The guards looked eager . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere it is true that an expert must be allowed his own , individual ways  --  his little crotchets , if you will . If he is to perform properly ? " " But I have not asked you to perform , " Hunar bubbled at me . " I have asked you here to order you off this world . " I looked surprised , keeping the guards in the corner of my eye . " Oh ? " I said . " Why ? " He frowned at me . " I need no reasons , worm . I am Hunar . I am the Grand Seigneur . " I sighed a little . " True , " I said . " All quite , quite true . But not , I 'm afraid , sufficient for the Comity . If I were forced  | to leave , you see , they might want to know why  --  interference with a free citizen . And if some fatal accident were to happen to me " ? the guards still had n't moved , and they still looked very damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of questions afterward . I 'm fairly well known , after all . It might cause talk . " " Ha , " Hunar said . " What do I care for talk ? " I shrugged . " A little talk is nothing , " I said . " Words on the wind . But a little more  --  in the wrong place  --  can overturn even the best of Treaties . If non-intervention were to be questioned , in the Comity Home Worlds ? " " It means nothing to Me , " he said grandly , but he waved the guards back . Round one . " On the other hand , " I said , swinging my stick a little , " I am , as you know , an expert . And  --  as with every expert ? my knowledge is for sale . " Hunar frowned . His face looked a very little better frowning than it did any other way ; the wrinkles hid most of his features , which were small and discouraging . " What do you mean , for sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This man Knave is a Survivor by trade , Great Sire , " he said , as well as I could fish the words out of his peculiar way of mangling them . " He offers to help you survive the present threat on your ? " " Enough ! " Hunar roared . He frowned again . Plig bowed even lower , and shut up . I waited . I gave him time to think . " You have heard this ridiculous rumor ? " he asked me . I nodded . " Dismiss your companion , " he told me . I did n't have to . My Policeman was up from a kneeling position and off like a shot , out of the Throne Room and , I imagine , right on out of the State Palace .  | I never saw him again , and  --  what the Hell  --  I wish him well . " Guards ? " Hunar began , and Plig spoke up again . " Great Sire , you may not dismiss all of your protection ! They know of the rumor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not harm them . And their services , with a stranger here in the room ? " " True , " I cut in . " You have no reason to trust me . Keep your guards . I 'm outnumbered and outgunned . " Plig gasped . " You carry weapons ? " he asked me , twisting round a bit as he knelt . " Here ? " " I carry weapons , " I said , " everywhere . I 'm a Survivor . I looked at Hunar . He waited , made a gesture to the guards at both sides of the room , and then nodded . Very slowly and carefully , I drew my slug gun from its hiding-place along my hip  --  it does n't make a bulge ; maybe I just have a better tailor than Hunar 's Secret Police  --  and showed it in my hand , holding it on my palm . It 's a big , noisy gun . It holds ten slugs , and it looks as deadly as can be . Hunar said : " Give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . If you leave . " A guard was at my side instantly . I did n't hesitate . I gave him the gun . He took it , handling it with curiosity . I 'd put it on safety ; there was only a minimal chance he 'd blow his foot off with the thing if he fooled with it . " I 'm a Survivor , " I said . " I do n't like death . " " But a Survivor ? " Hunar began . " Is supposed to kill people , " I said . " Sure . Only that 's the one thing I do n't like doing . A Survivor , Great Sire " ? the title , I thought , might oil a wheel or two , much as I disliked the damned thing ? " is a collector of information , because information is what helps you to survive . Personally , I hate killing people : there 's very little information  | you can get from a dead man . " All quite true ; but there are , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . " Yes , " he said at last , rather slowly . " From dead men , yes . But before they die .. . and from women . . . before they die ... you will often get much information , Information you did not even suspect they might have . If you  --  ah  --  if you work at it with dedication . " He gave me a big , fat smile and his tiny eyes glittered in that lump of a face . It had n't been one of the exceptions I 'd thought of . I had heard about Hunar 's torture chambers , of course . I 'd heard that they were not so much a method of gathering information  --  though they were that  --  as a hobby , practiced for its own lovely sake .. . And I could see Hunar , sitting in some padded chair , down in those special rooms , watching and smiling in the soundproofed dungeons . . . watching , and smiling , and , now and then , suggesting some little variation , some small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said evenly . " You can indeed . At the moment , however ? " " Let us not mince words , " he said . I had n't known we had been , whatever it is . " Agreed , " I said blandly . He did n't want to mince , I would n't mince . " The rumors have been uniform , " he said . " And  --  surprisingly  --  detailed . " He gave me that smile again . " We are quite sure of that . " I fought down a wave of nausea . Torture was Hunar 's hobby in any case , and the people he 'd questioned about the rumor might have been dragged in anyway , on another matter  --  were likely to be , in fact , as the life of an Underground member on Haven III was almost always nasty , brutish and short . But the rumor had caused . . . what had happened . I knew one thing : I knew that thousands had died in  | those chambers for no reason whatever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a purpose . That was what they were ready to do , had sworn to do , the day they joined the Underground . The knowledge did nothing whatever for my nausea . " Tomorrow , " I said , " at two hours after sunset  --  nine o'clock , here , in this area  --  someone is supposed to kill you , and steal the Crown Jewels . That 's the rumor . " Hunar 's frown slowly became a glower . " As I have said , " he told me . " Surprising detail . A time  --  a pair of actions  --  never before have I received so detailed an announcement . " Once more , that smile . " And it occurs just when you arrive on My world . " " So it does , " I said . " Whoever made the plan must n't have known I was coming . " " Eh ? " That was Plig . Hunar shot him a glance of contempt . He seemed used to it . " I have , as you say , a reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing  --  and my services are for sale or rent . You may remember that I recovered the jewels of Haven IV ? " " Those reptiles ! " Hunar said . " What have I to do with them ? " They 're not actually reptiles ; they 're homeothermic , to start with . But it seemed time for a bit more oil instead of an exobiology lesson . " Only this , Great Sire , " I said . " They hired me ; I succeeded . I dislike killing . Now , if the person who planned all this knew I was coming , he might have been more cautious . He might have thought that  --  since killing is repugnant to me  --  I would offer my services to prevent him . And my reputation is such  --  I speak without modesty ; we have n't time for it  --  that he might have refrained . " Plig said : " Your reputation also includes thievery . " I nodded . " True . And I have killed when necessary . If ,  | for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I might kill him . I should be sorry to do so ? " " I would also be sorry , " Hunar bubbled . " Save him ? save him , by all means . We shall have a questioning  --  a special questioning  --  a long , elaborate questioning . . . " His voice trailed off into that fat smile . I record this to the credit of Billibin Plig : he turned a little green , and he had to swallow hard . Every man has his limits . Doubtless Hunar the Great had some , too . God alone knows what they were . However : " I shall not kill him if I can avoid it , Great Sire . " " But ? " Plig began , recovering fast . Hunar looked annoyed . " I shall pay this Knave well for his  --  services , " he said . " A hundred thousand  --  no , two hundred thousand dollars . " " It 's a high price , " I said truthfully . " But , then , it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Sire , " Plig broke in , talking so fast it was damned near impossible to understand him , " to entrust your entire safety to this one man , this stranger ? " So Plig had seen an inch ahead of his odd-looking nose . " Entire safety ? " I said . " Do you mean to think I 'm going to stay here , alone , and just wait just myself and yourah  --  superior , locked in a room together ? " Which was just what Plig had thought ; he almost nodded at me . " I am not out of my mind , " I said . " I want guards . Guards ! The more the better  --  at least fifteen , and more if available . Here in the Throne Room  --  where we can wait for the assassin , and trap him  --  we 'll need the most men you can find . And the very best . " I shrugged . " After all , " I said , " when you go out after a killer , you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Survivor , Chancellor Plig , and I know my trade ; I not only want guards , I insist on guards  --  and a lot of them ! " He just stared at me . Hunar 's personal guards might  | have been buyable  --  but I had n't even been on-planet long enough to do that sort of job . And Plig knew perfectly well that I did n't have the finances available for it , in any case . And , just maybe , he knew what I did : the best men in any trade are n't buyable , anywhere . Hunar , meanwhile , said : " Does that answer you , Chan-cellor ? " " The  --  best guards , " Plig said . " Fifteen  --  twenty of them . . . " " Fine , " I said . " Get right to work on it . I 'll want to talk to them , and to the chief guard as well . Get his agreement on the best positioning here ? " " And I ? " " And you , Great Sire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the assassin will come to you  --  so that you can witness his capture , and give immediate orders regarding his  --  well , his questioning . " " Great Sire ? " Plig began , but Hunar waved him into silence . " So it shall be , " he said . " Nine tomorrow evening .. . it seems a long time to wait . " Then he brightened up . " Well , we will pass the time somehow , " he said . " Perhaps you will tell me of your adventures , Knave  --  or I will show you some of the specialties of the State Palace . We will amuse ourselves , somehow  --  until I have him in My hands . " I swallowed hard . " I  --  I 'm supposed to stay here ? " " Of course , " Hunar said . " I sent for you , unprepared ? to send you away . Now you will remain , to foil this attack upon My person . But I am not entirely reckless Knave : I am cautious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will not let you out of My sight , between now and nine tomorrow night . "  | page deleted  | page deleted  | never fit right since . No knives up the sleeves , no guns in the pants , no heat-rays in the shoe-soles , no radio sets in the heels ( my walking-stick was X-rayed , or whatever it is they do , in case it contained metal ; I took the silver top off and put it back on , and it passed ) , and so on , and so on . Even the white tie got a going-over , and was finally passed as being a white tie . Hell , I could have told them that . Time passed . We ate again . State banquet . Plig was served with a mush that looked grey and unappetizing . The rest of us : fruits , native vegetables and roots , a thin-sliced native meat that tasted like a cross between veal and salmon ? wine for Hunar , who drank a lot of it , and water for me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Plig went on looking puzzled . Somewhere , he kept telling himself , there was a catch . But there I sat  --  without my weapon  --  fully searched , dressed to the nines , for God 's sake , walking stick leaning against my chair by my side  --  calmly and casually eating away , exchanging banter with Hunar , with Ladden , with Court officials rung in on us as what was apparently supposed to be a treat .. . There I sat without a care in the world  --  and without the slightest chance to do any damage . I 'd even insisted on every one of those guards . Plig ate his mush , and looked puzzled . The rest of us chattered , said nothing of any importance , and finished at last . Seven-thirty . Seven forty-five . Eight o'clock : curtain time . ' I ! Places , everyone . Hunar on the throne . Guards in front , at the sides , behind .  | Plig near the globe of light with the five guards . He 'd heard about the strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an arrangement , as I 'd thought they might . Plig could stand in a marked space , from eight to nine . If he moved out of it , toward the globe ? one of the guards would shoot him . He seemed perfectly satisfied . He knew where the center of action had to be  --  that globe  --  and he was sticking by it . The sight of him gladdened my heart . For one thing , I was standing right beside him . Ladden and I , of course , had made the same arrangement  --  in fact , that could just be where Plig had gotten the idea . We 'd made it in his hearing  --  by accident , of course . And I could move away  --  I could move anywhere ? except toward that globe . I leaned on my walking stick , thoughtfully . All I needed , I felt , was a monocle and a good tailor . What Ladden 's men had done to my best dress suit was a sin and a shame . But I kept up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing still fit . Eight-thirty . Eight forty-five . Eight-fifty . Ladden  --  one of the five near the globe , of course  --  was breathing fast . I murmured : " Calm , cousin . The more excitement , the less alertness . " He nodded , swallowed hard and tried for calm . He did n't make it . Nobody did . Even Hunar was fidgeting . And a man that fat does n't burn up energy fidgeting unless he 's truly nervous . Eight fifty-five . One minute to nine . .  | I whirled on Plig , grabbed him with both hands , and shouted : " Watch him ! He 's trying to ? " The five guards , including Ladden , were pointing guns at us both . The clock struck once . Again . Plig said : " He ? " " Watch him , for God 's sake ! " I shouted . " He 's getting away I shoved Plig an inch to the right  --  not toward the globe , not away from it . The guards followed that shove . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose from me and run . The clock kept striking . Six , seven .. . I held him for one second longer as he struggled . Then I threw him at the globe . Hell , he weighed less than ninety pounds  --  and the globe was such an easy target .. . Somebody fired where we had been . Somebody else fired at the globe , of all things  --  I have no idea why  --  and singed Plig on the way up . I was traveling in the other direction , fast . Plig hit the globe , and the lights went out . The clock hit nine , and stopped striking . Somebody screamed  --  Hunar , maybe . Somebody else barked orders . Then Ladden 's voice : " Guards around the throne . Stay where you are . Stay where you are . Nobody can get past you . Nobody can come near you without showing himself ? without making a sound you can hear . Stay where you are . Be ready to shoot . " Good , professional orders . Not good enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed that silver top again , of course .  | Nassanank did n't need his hat , and it might have reflected some stray light beam from somewhere . And a snake makes no noise going up three stairs . Nassanank was fast , and he had a good memory ; he knew just where Hunar was . He did n't need to know anything else . Hunar gave a sudden , choked cry just one  --  and then fell straight off the throne , face forward , onto the stairs . Strangled , and dead . Ladden 's orders meant nothing any more to the throne guards . Even in total darkness  --  or as near total as that place could get  --  they could hear , and just maybe , in a vague sort of way , even see Hunar choke and fall . So they went toward him . To save him , maybe . Or to catch his assassin . And I moved  --  at top speed . Straight toward the throne  --  a little to the left  --  I had my hands on the damned crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throne and went sss . I do n't think it was audible eighteen inches away . There was a good deal going on by then . I headed for the side door , walking-stick climbing its way to a good , secure perch on my shoulders , then lying flat . The side door led to a passage , offices , some stairs  --  and outside , onto the grounds . And the lights there were on a switch  --  convenient . Not necessary ; I think I could have made it in broad daylight . But convenient . I headed for the switch . I also began to shout : " Help ! Help ! The Grand Seigneur  --  help ! Murder ! Assassins ! In the Throne Room  --  the Reception Hall  --  help ! Reception Hall  --  help ! " And so forth . I was moving so fast my voice had no special location ,  | not in the dark . I hit the side door , found the switch that blacked out a big swatch of the grounds , and kept on going . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and running like hell . I do n't like guard dogs . I 'm very glad I did n't have to go up against them . As I ran , I was blowing a whistle . It had been built into the hat of my walking-stick  --  the umbrella of the gardener of my aunt  --  well , you know what I mean . I could n't hear it . The dogs could . And it stopped them dead . They sat on their damned haunches and yowled and screamed and carried on .. . I kept on blowing until we were well off the Palace grounds . Jessiss was waiting with an Underground driver and a car . We were at the spaceport in twenty minutes . We were on Haven IV in five hours . The damnedest thing .. . Haven III was in a confusion you would n't believe . With Hunar dead , only God knew what the line of succession was . Plig had followers and wanted Ladden arrested for singeing him  --  high treason . Other members of the Court had other ideas . Ladden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the Guard . Whereupon there arose , all of a sudden and in a great halo of noise and lights , a Committee of Liberty . This Committee claimed to be the only rightful government of Haven III , the only one that could command the loyalty of a majority of its citizens  --  and , you know , they were right ? Seems none of the Court types could combine with any  | of the other Court types . Result : a split vote . Everybody had a faction , and every faction was vocal . But the Committee faction was , quite visibly , the largest . It was also the most vocal . It had equipment  --  sound trucks , presses for instant pamphlets , armbands , even small-power beamers for everyone . The right of the people to keep and bear arms  --  well , you know . Four months passed , very busily . And then Haven II recognized the Committee . Haven IV followed suit at once . ( " We ca n't do it before , " is what Nassanank told Jessiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that involves humans : they must be followed . " Jessiss agreed ; I wo n't say she liked the idea of that fourmonth wait , but she agreed . ) And that Committee .. . People wondered , briefly , where it got all that equipment . Seemed as if an awfully efficient Underground had been waiting there on Haven III for the Mystery Assassination and the Great Crown Robbery . Well . . . not exactly . There had been an Underground , and it had formed , more or less , such a Committee . And then it had been financed . I 'd figured that damned crown at fifty million dollars , minimum . On a world I wo n't mention , to a group of buyers I wo n't identify  --  what difference does it make , really ? ? it brought in fifty-six . The Committee received a large bundle of cash , topped by a printed note signed A Friend . Forty million dollars . It was enough . It was more than enough . I think forty million dollars would have gold-plated every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
