S T OR Y PEACE OF MIND By T. Coraghessan Boyle first she told them the story of the family surprised over their corn muffins by the masked intruder . " He was a black man , " she said , dropping her voice and at the same time allowing a hint of tremolo to creep into it , " and he was wearing a lifelike mask of President Reagan . He just jimmied the lock and waltzed in the front door with the morning paper as if he was delivering flowers or something ... they thought it was a joke at first . " Giselle 's voice became hushed now , confidential , as she described how he 'd brutalized the children , humiliated the wife ? " sexually , if you know what I mean " ? bound them all to the kitchen chairs with twists of sheer pantyhose . Worse , she said , he dug a scratchy old copy of Sam &; Dave 's " Soul Man " out of the record collection and made them listen to it over and over as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam &; Dave choked off , the stereo rudely torn from the socket and thrown in with the rest of their things  --  she paused here to draw a calculated breath ? " And at 7:30 A.M. , no less . " She had them , she could see it in the way the pretty little wife 's eyes went dark with hate and the balding husband clutched fitfully at his pockets  --  she had them , but she poured it on anyway , flexing her verbal muscles , not yet noon and a sale , a big sale , already in the bag . So she gave them an abbreviated version of the story of the elderly lady and the overworked T. Coraghessan Boyle 's third collection of short stories , If the River Was Whiskey , will be published this spring by Viking . His story " Sorry Fugu " appeared in the October /987 issue of Harper 's Magazine . Mexican from the knife-sharpening service and wrung some hideous new truths from the tale of the housewife who came home to find a strange car in her garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after she 'd paused to level a doleful , frightened look at the wife . Giselle sighed . " Two white men met her at the door . They were in their early forties , nicely dressed , polite  --  she thought they were real estate people or something . They escorted her into the house , bundled up the rugs , the paintings , the camcorder and VCR , and then took turns desecrating " ? that was the term she used , it got them every time ? " desecrating her naked body with the cigarette lighter from her very own car . " The husband and wife exchanged a glance , then signed on for the whole schmear : five thousand and some-odd dollars for the alarm system  --  every window , door , keyhole , and crevice wired  --  and sixty bucks a month for a pair of " Armed Response " signs to stick in the lawn . Giselle slid into the front seat of the Mercedes and cranked up the salsa music that made her feel as if every day was a fiesta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked her watch and drew a circle around the next name on her list . It was a few minutes past twelve , crime was rampant , and she was feeling lucky . She tapped her foot and whistled along with the sour , jostling trumpets  --  no doubt about it , she 'd have another sale before lunch . he balding husband stood at the window and watched the Mercedes back out of the driveway , drift into gear , and glide soundlessly up the street . It took him a moment before he STORY 65 realized he was still clutching his checkbook . " God , HA , " he said ( or rather croaked  --  something seemed to be wrong with his throat ) , " it 's a lot of money . " The pretty little wife , Hilary , crouched frozen on the couch , legs drawn up to her chest , feet bare , toenails glistening . " They stuff your underwear in your mouth , " she whispered ; " that 's the worst thing . Can you imagine that , I mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't answer . He was thinking of the masked intruder  --  that maniac disguised as the President  --  and of his own children , whose heedless squeals of joy came to him like hosannas from the swing set out back . He 'd been a fool , he saw that now . How could he have thought , even for a minute , that they 'd be safe out here in the suburbs ! The world was violent , rotten , corrupt , seething with hatred and perversion , and there was no escaping it . Everything you worked for , everything you loved , had to be locked up as if you were in a castle under siege . " I wonder what they did to her , " Hilary said . " Who ? " " That woman  --  the one with the cigarette moN=.0. - - 4MMIN=111 ? 41111-lighter . I heard they burn their initials into you . " Yes , of course they did , he thought  --  why would n't they ? They sold crack in the elementary schools , pissed in the alleys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd cleaned out Denny Davidson while he was in the Bahamas and ripped the stereo out of Phyllis Steubig 's Peugeot . And just last week they 'd stolen two brand-new Ironcast aluminum garbage cans from the curb in front of the neighbor 's house  --  just dumped the trash in the street and drove off with them . " What do you think , Hit ? " he asked . " We can still get out of it . " " I do n't care what it costs , " she murmured , her voice drained of emotion . " I wo n't be able to sleep till it 's in . " Ellis crossed the room to gaze out on the sun-dappled backyard . Mifty and Corinne were on the swings , pumping hard , lifting up into the sky and falling back again with a pure rhythmic grace that was suddenly so poignant he could feel a sob rising in his throat . " I wo n't either , " he said , turning to his wife and spreading his hands as if in supplication . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . Giselle was pretty good with directions ? " If only for our peace of mind . " she had to be , in her business  --  but still she had to pull over three times to consult her street guide before she found the next address on her list . The house was in a seedy , run-down neighborhood of blasted trees , gutted cars , and tacky little houses , the kind of neighborhood that just made her blood boil . How could people live like that ? she wondered , flicking off the tape in disgust . Did n't they have any self-respect ? She hit the accelerator , scattering a pack of snarling , hyena-like dogs , dodged a stained mattress and a pair of overturned trash cans , and swung into the driveway of a house that looked as if it had illustrations by Jeff Jackson been bombed , partially reconstructed , and then bombed again . There has to be some mistake , she thought . She glanced up and caught the eye of a man sitting on the porch next door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms emblazoned with lurid tattoos , and he was lifting a beer can to his lips when he saw that she was peering at him from behind the frosted window of her car . Slowly , as if it cost him an enormous effort , he lowered the beer can and raised the middle finger of his free hand . She rechecked her list-7718 Picador Drive . There was no number on the house in front of her , but the house to the left was 7716 and the one to the right 7720 . This was it , all right . She stepped out of the car with her briefcase , squared her shoulders , and slammed the door , all the while wondering what in god 's name the owner of a place like this would want with an alarm system . These were the sort of people who broke into houses  --  and here she turned to give the fat man an icy glare  --  not the ones who had anything to protect . But then what did she care ? A sale was a sale . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrist , waited for the reassuring bleat of response from the bowels of the car , and marched up the walk . The man who answered the door was tall and stooped  --  mid-fifties , she guessed  --  and he looked like a scholar in his wire-rims and dingy cardigan with leather elbow patches . His hair was the color of freshly turned dirt and his eyes  --  slightly distorted and swimming behind the thick lenses  --  were as blue as the skies over Oklahoma . " Mr. Coles ? " she said . He looked her up and down , taking his time . " And what 're you supposed to he , " he breathed in a wheezy humorless drawl , " the Avon lady or something ! " It was then that she noticed the nervous little woman frozen in the shadows of the hallway behind him . " Everett , " the woman said in a soft , pleading tone , but the man took no notice of her . " Or do n't tell me , " he said , " you 're selling Girl Scout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Giselle was unshakable . She saw her opening and thrust out her hand . " Giselle Nyerges , " she said , " I 'm from SecureCo . You contacted us about a home security system . " The woman vanished . The fat man next door blew into his fist , producing a rude noise , and Everett Coles , with a grin that showed too much gum , took her hand and led her into the house . Inside , the place was n't as bad as she 'd expected . K Mart taste , of course , furniture made of particleboard , hopelessly tacky bric-a-brac , needlepoint homilies on the walls , but at least it was spare . And clean . The man led her through the living room to the open-beam kitchen andthrew himself down in a chair at the formica table . A sliding glass door gave onto the dusty expanse of the backyard . " So , " he said . " Let 's hear it . " " First I want to tell you how happy I am that you 're considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , sitting opposite him and throwing the latches on her briefcase with a professional snap . " I do n't know if you heard about it , " she said , the conspiratorial whisper creeping into her voice , " but just last week they found a couple  --  both retirees , on a fixed income  --  bludgeoned to death in their home not three blocks from here . And they 'd been security-conscious too  --  dead bolts on the doors and safety locks on the windows . The killer was this black man  --  a Negro  --  and he was wearing a lifelike mask of President Reagan ... well , he found this croquet mallet ... " She faltered . The man was looking at her in the oddest way . He was grinning  --  grinning as if she were telling a joke  --  and there was something wrong with his eyes . They seemed to be jerking back and forth in the sockets , jittering like the shiny little balls in a pinball machine . " I know it 's not a pleasant story , Mr. Coles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers to know that , that ... " Those eyes were driving her crazy . She looked down , shuffling through the papers in her briefcase . " They crowd you , " he said . " Pardon ? " she said , looking up again . " Sons of bitches , " he growled , " they crowd you . " She found herself gazing over his shoulder at the neat little needlepoint display on the kitchen wall : SEMPER FIDELIS ; HOME SWEET HOME ; BURN , BABY , BURN . " You like ? " he asked . Burn , Baby , Burn ? " Did them myself . " He dropped the grin and gazed out on nothing . " Got a lot of time on my hands . " She felt herself slipping . This was n't the way it was supposed to go at all . She was wondering if she should hit him with another horror story or get down to inspecting the house and writing up an estimate , when he asked if she wanted a drink . " Thank you , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smile , " It 's a bit early in the day for me . " He said nothing , just looked at her with those jumpy blue eyes till she had to turn away . " Shit , " he spat suddenly , " come down off your high horse , lady , let your hair down , loosen up . " She cleared her throat . " Yes , well , should n't we have a look around so I can assess your needs ? " " Gin , " he said , and his voice was flat and calm again , " it 's the elixir of life . " He made no move to get up from the table . " You 're a good-looking woman , you know that ? " " Thank you , " she said in her smallest voice . " Should n't we ? ? " " Got them high heels and pretty little ankles , nice earrings , hair all done up , and that smart little tweed suit  --  of course you know you 're a good-looking woman . Bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She could n't help herself now . All she wanted was to get up from the table and away from those jittery eyes , sale or no sale . " Listen , " she said , " listen to me . There was this woman and she came home and there was this strange car in her garage ? " " il " No , " he said , " you listen to me . " Vnty Rapist Escapes , ' " Hilary read aloud in a clear declamatory tone , setting down her coffee mug and spreading out the Metro section as if it were a sacred text . " ' Norbert Baptiste , 27 , of Silverlake , dubbed the Panty Rapist because he gagged his victims with their own underthings ' " She broke off to give her husband a look of muted triumph . " You see , " she said , lifting the coffee mug to her lips , " I told you . With their own underthings . " Ellis was puzzling over the box scores of the previous night 's ball games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was early Saturday morning , Mifty and Corinne were in the den watching cartoons , and the house alarm was still set from the night before . In a while , after he 'd finished his muesli and his second cup of coffee , he 'd punch in the code and disarm the thing and then maybe do a little gardening and afterward take the girls to the park . He was n't really listening , and he murmured a halfhearted reply . " And can you imagine Tina Carfarct trying to tell me we were just wasting Our money on the alarm system ? " She pinched her voice in mockery : " ' I hate to tell you , HA , but this is the safest neighborhood in L A. ' Jesus , she 's like a Pollyanna or something , but you know what it is , do n't you ? " Ellis looked up from the paper . " They 're too cheap , that 's what her and Sid both . They 're going to take their chances , hope it happens to the next guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's sick . It really is . " " You wo n't get any argument from me , " Ellis said , shaking his head till he could feel the morning looseness in his jowls . The night before last they 'd had the Carfarcts and their twelve-year-old boy , Brewster , over for dinner  --  a nice sole amandine and scalloped potatoes Ellis had whipped up himself  --  and the chief topic of conversation was , of course , the new alarm system . " I do n't know , " Sid had said ( Sid was forty , handsome as a prince , an investment counselor who 'd once taught high school social studies ) , " it 's kind of like being a prisoner in your own home . " " All that money , " Tina chimed in , sucking at the cherry of her second Manhattan , " I mean , I do n't think I could stand it . Like Sid says , I 'd feel like I was a prisoner or something , afraid to step out into my own yard because some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The guy in the Reagan mask was no phantom , " Hilary said , leaning across the table to slash the air with the flat of her hand , bracelets ajangle . " Or those two men white men who accosted that woman in her own garage " She was so wrought up she could n't go on . She turned to her husband , tears welling in her eyes . " Go on , El , " she said , " tell them . " It was then that Tina made her " safest neighborhood in L.A. " remark and Sid , draining his glass and setting it down carefully on the table , said in a phlegmy , ruminative voice , " I do n't know , it 's like you 've got no faith in your fellow man , " to which Ellis snapped , " Do n't be naive , Sid . " Even Tina scored him for that one . " Oh , come off it , Sid , " she said , giving him a sour look . " Let 's face it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haves and have-nots , and like it or not , we 're the haves . " " I do n't deny there 's a lot of crazies out there and all , " Tina went on , swiveling to face Ellis . " It 's just that the whole idea of having an alarm on everything -- I mean you ca n't park your car at the mall without one  --  is just , well , it 's a sad thing . I mean next thing you know people 'll be wearing body alarms to work rub up against them in a crowd and bingo ! lights flash and sirens go off . " She sat back , pleased with herself , a tiny , elegant blonde in a low-cut cocktail dress and a smug grin , untouched , unafraid , a woman without a care in the world . But then Sid wanted to see the thing and all four of them went to the front door and gathered round the glowing black plastic panel as if it were some rare jewel , some treasure built into the wall . Ellis opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained the system 's " brain , " as the SecureCo woman had called it , and Sid , taken by the allure of the thing , lightly touched the tip of his index finger to the neat glowing red strip at the bottom that read EMERGENCY . Instantly , the scene was transformed . Whereas a moment earlier they 'd been calm , civilized people having a drink before a calm , civilized meal , they were suddenly transformed into hand-wringing zombies , helpless in the face of the technology that assaulted them . For Sid had SecureCo uniform , with nightstick and gun . ne was tall and he had a mustache . He invited himself in . " There a problem ? " he asked . " No , no , " Ellis said , standing in the entranceway , heart pounding , acutely aware of his guests ' eyes on him , " it 's a new system and we , uh  --  it was a mistake . " " Name ? " the man said . " Hunsicker . Ellis . " " Code word ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used for purposes of positive identification in just such a situation as this , was Hilary 's inspiration . Pick something easy to remember , the Secure-Co woman had said , and Hilary had chosen the name of the kids ' pet rabbit , Honey Bunny . Ellis could n't say the words . Not in front of this humorless man in the mustache , not with Sid and Tina watching him with those tight mocking smiles on their lips ... " Code word ? " the man repeated . Hilary was sunk into the couch at the far end of the coffee table . She leaned forward and raised her hand like a child in class , waving it to catch the guard 's attention . " Honey Bunny , " she said in a gasp that made the hair prickle at the back of Ellis 's neck , " it 's Honey Bunny . " That had been two nights ago . But now , in the clear light of Saturday morning , after sleeping the sleep of the just  --  and prudent ( Panty Rapist  --  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing to him ) ? feeling self-satisfied and content right on down to the felt lining of his slippers , Ellis sat back , stretched , and gave his wife a rich little smile . " 1 guess it 's a matter of priorities , honey , " he said . " Sid and Tina can think what they want , but you know what I say  --  better safe than sorry . " When she talked about it afterward  --  with . ever been so scared in all her life . She meant it DO . This was no honor story clipped from the iewspaper , this was real . And it happened to The guy was crazy . Creepy . Sick . He 'd kept - ler there over four hours , and he had no inten-:ion of buying anything  --  she could see that in the first fifteen minutes . He just wanted an audience . Somebody to rant at , to threaten , to pin down with those jittery blue eyes . Richard had wanted her to go to the police , but she balked . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bruised her arm . But what could the police do ? ? she 'd gone there of her own free will . Her own free will . He 'd said that . Those were his exact words . Indignant , maybe a little shaken , she 'd gotten up from the kitchen table to stuff her papers back into the briefcase , He was cursing under his breath , muttering darkly about the idiots on the freeway in their big-ass Mercedes , crowding him , about spies and niggers and junior high kids cutting through his yard ? " Free country , my ass ! " he 'd shouted suddenly . " Free for every punk and weirdo and greaser to crap all over what little bit I got left , but let me get up from this table and put a couple holes in one of the little pecker-heads and we 'll see how free it is . And I suppose you 're going to protect me , huh , Miss Mercedes-Benz with your heels and stockings and your big high-tech alarm system , huh ? " When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just get me out of here , she was thinking  --  that was when he grabbed her ann . " Sit down , " he snarled , and she tried to shake free but could n't , he was strong with the rage of the psychopath , the lion in its den , the loony up against the wall . " You 're hurting me , " she said as he forced her back down . " Mr .... Coles ! " and she heard her own voice jump with anger , fright , pain . " Yeah , that 's right , " he said , tightening his grip , " but you came here of your own free will , did n't you ? Thought you were going to sucker me , huh ? Run me a song and dance and lay your high-tech crap and your big bad SecureCo guards on me --  -- -oh , I 've seen them , bunch of tit-suckers and college wimps , who they going to stop ? Huh ? " He dropped her arm and challenged her with his jumpy mad tight-jawed glare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sit down ! We got business here , goddamnit ! " And then he was calling for his wife : " Glenys ! Woman ! Get your ass in here . " If she 'd expected anything from the wife , any help or melioration , Giselle could see at a glance just how hopeless it was . The woman would n't look at her . She appeared in the doorway , pale as death , her hands trembling , staring at the carpet like a whipped dog . " Two G &; Ts , " Coles said , sucking in his breath as if he were on the very edge of something , at the very beginning , " tall , with a wedge of lime . " " But ? " Giselle began to protest , looking from Coles to the woman . " You 'll drink with me , all right . " Coles 's voice came back at her like a blade of ice . " Get friendly , huh ? Show me what you got . " And then he turned away , his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked up , staring past her . " You going to keep the sons of bitches away from me , you going to keep them off my back , you going to give me any guarantees ? " His voice rose . " I got a gun collection worth $12,000 in there  --  you going to answer for that ? For my color TV ? The goddamned trash can even ? " Giselle sat rigid , wondering if she could make a break for the back door and wondering if he was the type to keep it locked . " Sell me , " he demanded , looking at her now . The woman set down the gin and tonics and then faded back into the shadows of the hallway , Giselle said nothing . " Tell me about the man in the mask , " he said , grinning again , grinning wide , too wide , " tell me about those poor old retired people . Come on , " he said , his eyes taunting her , " sell me . I want it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your high-tech bullshit . " He held her eyes , gulped half his drink and set the glass down again . " I mean realty , " he said . " For my peace of mind . " and the fire in his guts over that moron with the barking face who 'd run into him on the freeway just about put out , and then he looks up from the kitchen table and what does he see but this sorry lardassed spawn of a sorry tattooed beer-swilling lardass of a father cutting through the yard with his black death's-head T-shirt and his loose-leaf and book jackets , and that 's it . There 's no more thinking , no more reason , no insurance or hope . He 's up out of the chair like a shot and into the den , and then he 's punching the barrel of the Mannlicher right through the glass of the den window . The fat little fuck , he 's out there under the grapefruit tree , shirttail hanging out , turning at the sound , and then kaboom , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coles is in his car , fender rubbing against the tire in back where that sorry sack of shit ran into him , and slamming out the driveway . He 's got the Mannlicher on the seat beside him and a couple fistfuls of ammunition and he 's peppering the side of Ruby 's turd-colored house with a blast from his Weatherby pump-action shotgun . He grazes a parked camper on his way up the block , slams over a couple of garbage cans , and leans out the window to take the head off somebody 's yapping poodle as he careens out onto the boulevard , every wire gone loose in his head . Ellis Hunsicker woke early . He 'd dreamt he to whisper outside , and he shut his eyes , drifting off like a little cloud . When he woke again it was to the beep-beepbeep of the house alarm and to the hazy apprehension of some god-awful crash  --  a jet breaking the sound barrier , the first rumbling clap of the quake he lived in constant fear of ? an apprehension that something was amiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was somehow different , more high-pitched and admonitory than the beep-beepbeeping occasioned by a child going out to cuddle a bunny . He sat up . Hilary rose to her elbows beside him , looking bewildered , and in that instant the alarm was silenced forever by the unmistakable roar of a gun blast . Ellis 's heart froze . Hilary cried out . There was the heavy thump of footsteps below , a faint choked whimper as of little girls startled in their sleep , and then a strange voice ? high , hoarse , and raging ? that chewed up the morning like a set of jaws . " Armed response ! " the voice howled . " Armed response , goddamnit ! Armed response ! " he couple strained forward like mourners at a funeral . Giselle had them , she knew that . They 'd looked scared when she came to the door , a pair of timid rabbity faces peering out at her from behind the matching frames of their prescription glasses , and they seated themselves on the edge of the couch as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wringing their hands and darting uneasy glances out the window as she described the perpetrator ? " A white man , dressed like a schoolteacher , but with these wicked , jittery eyes that just sent a shiver through you . " She focused on the woman as she described the victims . There was a boy , just fourteen years old , on his way to school , and a woman in a Mercedes driving down to the corner store for coffee filters . And then the family  --  they must have read about it  --  all of them , and not three blocks from where they were now sitting . " He was thirty-five years old , " she said in a husky voice , ' ' an engineer at Rocketdyne , his whole life ahead of him ... and she , she was one of these supernice people who ... and the children ... " She could n't go on . The man  --  Mr. Dunsinane , was n't that the name ? ? leaned forward and handed her a Kleenex . Oh , she had them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deluxe Laser Alert System , stock in the company , mikes for every flower in the garden , but the old charge just was n't there . " I 'm sorry , " she whispered , fighting back a sob . It was weird , she thought , pressing the Kleenex to her face , but the masked intruder had never affected her like this , or the knife-sharpening Mexican either . It was Coles , of course , and those sick jumpy eyes of his , but it was the signs too . She could n't stop thinking about those signs  --  if they had n't been there , that is , stuck in the lawn like a red flag in front of a bull ... but there was no future in that . No , she told the story anyway , told it despite the chill that came over her and the thickening in her throat . She had to . If only for her peace of mind ..
