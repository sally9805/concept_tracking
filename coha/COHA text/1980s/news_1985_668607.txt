Video equipment isn ' t quite as volatile a commodity as , say , oranges or wheat . However , it is possible to make a killing in this market by buying when inventories are bulging . Conversely , an electronics trader can take a horrible beating by finding out too late that fresher and more desirable stock is coming to market . Right now , there are some good-to-excellent buys to be had in large screen television sets carrying brand names like RCA , Sharp , Sony , Sylvania and Zenith . Prices seem to have stabilized on videocassette recorders , for the time being , but within three months the VCR market should see another round of plunging prices , too . And by summer , both video cameras and portable VCRs will join the never-been-a-better-buy department . Here ' s why . In 1985 , we will witness the most radical technical changes in television since the introduction of color . The era of multi-channel TV sound broadcasting is dawning and virtually every TV manufacturer is introducing top-of-the-line sets equipped to receive the stereo feeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive either a second language or a specialty service like New Jersey Public Television ' s audio programs for the blind . ( NBC ' s Los Angeles affiliate already is simulcasting in Spanish . ) But before that revolution in TV sound can come about , all those left- over , top-of-the-line monaural sets must be flushed through the pipeline . So if you aren ' t excited about the prospect of hearing Johnny Carson , " Miami Vice " or " Friday Night Videos " in stereo this summer , now ' s the ideal time to pick up a TV set boasting most of the other desirable frills  --  remote control , cable readiness , fine wood cabinetry  --  for about $200 less than that same model sold for a couple of months ago . Not quite the same as stereo TV sets are " stereo-ready " televisions . These 1984 interim models feature built-in stereo amplifiers and two sets of speakers , but require an optional decoder box ( about $150 ) to receive over- the-air stereo and SAP audio signals . Some dealers still are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in a couple of months they ' ll have to drop the price  --  or throw in the decoder for " free "  --  to move out their inventory . Excellent buys are also to be found right now in color monitors  --  high resolution TVs that have direct audio and video inputs , but lack built-in video tuners . When introduced about four years ago , manufacturers believed the public would find it desirable to integrate monitors with a VCR , which already has a tuner section . It was the high-fidelity concept of " separate components " translated to video . But the makers underestimated how many people like to tape one channel while watching another , requiring separate tuners for both the VCR and the TV . Oops . So this year , the trend in high-tech TV sets is going to be sets that have direct audio and video inputs and a built-in TV tuner , like Sony ' s superb new XBR stereo monitor-receivers . And leftover monitors like the Sony Profeels are going out at prices that are " insane . " Up-sizing screens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s models . For example , the 19-inch set will be replaced in many lines by a 20-inch model . The new tube is flatter and squarer , providing a slightly wider viewing angle and slightly better corner reproduction than earlier models . And thanks to some designer magic , exterior dimensions of the new 20-inch sets are smaller than on the old 19-inchers . Does all this make last year ' s 19-inch set a loser ? Only if you think so . Come spring and summer , look for RCA and Zenith to slash prices on their 25-inch sets . Why ? New 26- and 27-inch picture tubes are coming in their fall lines . In March , a licensing embargo will be lifted , allowing Korean and Taiwanese VCRs to be imported to the United States . According to Video Business magazine , this new crop of imports ( including Goldstar , Samsung , and Daewood-Portland ) will account for more than a million VCR sales in the United States this year , with U.S. sales projections of up to 3 million VCRs in 1986 . Prices on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retail . At the moment , dealers are still getting as much as $650 for VHS recorders featuring " stereo recording with Dolby noise reduction . " The sound coming out of these players is acceptable to uncritical listeners , but it ' s no match for the quality in the newer Hi-Fi VCRs ( that use a completely different audio recording technology ) that should be selling for under $600 by summertime . At that point , an antiquated stereo-with-Dolby VCR will be worth about $450 . Pay no more ! Improvements in VCR picture quality are also on the way , first this summer from the Beta group with its " Super-Beta " recorder technology that will upgrade horizontal picture resolution from 240 lines to 300 lines and produce much better tape copies while maintaining the state-of-the-art Beta Hi-Fi sound . At first , Beta manufacturers will demand top dollar for the " Super " models , but the refinement doesn ' t actually cost and should trickle down to lower-priced models in short order . In the meanwhile , the asking price for 1984-85 Beta Hi-Fi VCR models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at a faster rate than for Hi-Fi VHS recorders . A recent RCA consumer survey found that 7 percent of color-TV owners were interested in purchasing a two-piece portable video system . Then when the survey subjects were told they ' d be able to purchase all the features of a two-piece system in an all-in-one , on-the-shoulder model , the consumer interest in buying a video portable climbed to 22 percent of total households ! That ' s why RCA and its Japanese associates at Hitachi are rushing to develop a one-piece " camcorder " similar to the 7 1/2-pound VHS Omni-Movie coming this summer from Panasonic and under other names from GE and Quasar . It ' s also why Sony is both refining its camcorders in the Beta format and plunging into 8mm camcorders , and why JVC is cranking up production of its much-in-demand VHS-C camcorder . For bargain hunters , all this activity is a sure sign that prices for name-brand portable separates  --  cameras and battery-powered VCRs  --  will plummet by fall.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
