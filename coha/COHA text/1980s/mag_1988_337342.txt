There is old-maidishness and there is the new celibacy . And everyone knows the cure for both of these unfortunate conditions : a man . Any man . The good news about these two small movies  --  The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne and High Tide  --  is that they permit their heroines ambiguous triumphs over this conventional wisdom . The bad news is that neither movie dares triumph over the conventionally compassionate view of the women . Or , for that matter , over the limits of conventionally mannered filmmaking . <P> Judith Hearne took up permanent residence in the literary world 's case load in 1955 when Novelist Brian Moore anatomized her " lonely passion . " In Peter Nelson 's screenplay , however , she is more a curio than a figure of powerful emotional relevance . This classic spinster ( to whose portrayal Maggie Smith brings all the right moves but nothing very individual ) is a Dublin piano teacher . Naturally she drinks a bit . Sometimes she drinks a lot . Her timorous gentility suggests to her landlady 's brother ( Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibilities of untapped wealth  --  enough of it , anyway , to finance a restaurant he wants to start . To Judith , his mercenary advances read as a last chance for romance . <P> After a purging crack-up , Judith is able to throw away all her crutches  --  booze , religion , romantic fantasies  --  and totter off into Celtic twilight under her own renewed power . Director Jack Clayton ( Room at the Top , The Great Gatsby ) seems to think these mingy cliches speak volumes . With his smugly self-effacing camera style , he could use , as the Irish say , a " wee jar " to warm him up . His movie needs a big jar to warm up the viewer . <P> High Tide 's Lilli ( seething enigmatically under the tight rein of Judy Davis ' performance ) is quite like Judith Hearne . Rootlessly she ranges the Australian provinces as another sort of fringe musician , backup singer for an Elvis imitator . She too drinks , and though she will indulge in desultory sex , it is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is presented with a last chance to turn her life around  --  to reveal her identity and reclaim her long-abandoned daughter Ally ( the soberly lovely Claudia Karvan ) . <P> Unlike Judith Hearne , High Tide is not whiny and overexplained . And under the direction of Gillian Armstrong ( My Brilliant Career , Mrs. Soffel ) , the lead actresses have an honest naturalism that almost makes us forget the coincidences and arthritic manipulations of Laura Jones ' script . But instead of calming our suspicions , Armstrong 's camera work  --  all zip pans , fast tracking and erratic boom shots  --  reinforces them . Maybe she should take phlegmatic lessons from Jack Clayton .
