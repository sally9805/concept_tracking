Each year more groups offer antique shows to benefit such worthy projects as schools , churches , museums , settlement houses , hospitals , scholarship funds , restoration projects , historical societies , and other charitable institutions. // In some cases , sponsoring groups gallantly run their own show , without benefit of outside paid management . In such cases , hard-working volunteer committees plan the show and locate exhibitors - staging , setting up , advertising , and running the event. // With or without outside-management help , a successful show requires a great deal of know-how and the combined efforts and personal drive of many dedicated people . There are no shortcuts , and a few shows have failed miserably because they lacked people with sufficient time and expertise to pull them together and put them across. // For those organizations that prefer to work with an outside show manager , two experts who now run many shows nationally are Russell Carrell of Salisbury , Conn. , and Henry Coger of Dallas. // One of Mr. Carrell ' s larger shows is the East Side Settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place each January at the 7th Regiment Armory in New York . All proceeds from the show , with the exception of exhibitors ' sales , are for the benefit of East Side Settlement House. // This prestigious event , begun in 1955 , has maintained the highest standards of taste and quality and demonstrates what able management , backed by a tireless and expert volunteer-committee , can produce . In its first year this show netted $12 , 000 for the settlement house . This year it netted about $250 , 000 from the gala preview benefit party , sale of advertising and catalogs , and gate receipts. // A recent new show in Baltimore , managed by Mr. Carrell , netted about $100 , 000 to benefit the Baltimore Museum of Art and Johns Hopkins Hospital . His first show in San Francisco raised $93 , 000 for the Enterprise High School students program . Nov. 10-13 , he will manage the Junior League show in Los Angeles , which will benefit league projects. // Other large shows managed by Mr. Carrell include the Cincinnati Antiques Festival , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Show , which benefits University Hospital ; a Lake Forest , Ill. , show , which benefits the Lake Forest Academy ; and Cleveland ' s Western Reserve Antique Show , which benefits a historical society. // June 25 , his Ridgefield , Conn. , outdoor flea market will benefit a local cat and dog shelter , while his outdoor Shaker antiques festival on Aug. 6 will help the Shaker Museum in Old Chatham , N.Y. His other small shows around New England this summer will benefit the Berkshire Garden Center ; Northfield Mount Hermon School in Northfield , Mass. ; the Bedford , N.Y. , Historical Society ; and the Golden Ball Tavern in Weston , Mass . Even his smallest shows , he says , raise between $10 , 000 and $12 , 000 in charity benefits. // Mr. Carrell ' s advice to a group wanting to sponsor a fund-raising antique show is : ' ' It is hard work all the way . Be sure you have a chairman who has plenty of time , a love of antiques , and a good sense of organization - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drums for the show , plan advertising , and attract dealers , patrons , and customers. ' ' // He reminds organizations that catalogs make less profit today than previously because of higher printing and production costs . He also warns that junk shows are not doing well at all . The most successful antique shows and flea markets , he says , are those that offer the most quality. // Down in the Sunbelt , show manager Henry Coger has worked with the volunteer members of the Dallas and Richardson Alumnae Chapters of Delta Delta Delta , a sorority , to build the eight-year-old annual spring Tri Delta Charity Antiques Show into one of the top shows in the country. // This show operates with a steering committee of 125 members that works all year on every aspect of the show , from catalog ad sales to public relations , special events , patrons , and manpower . But up to 900 sorority women serve in various capacities during the four-day run of the show , doing everything from selling tickets to providing lunch each day for the 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ingredients that make up a successful fund-raising show , Mr. Coger says they should include ' ' a very positive committee that is willing to hustle and work - and a good mix of fine dealers that offers a diversity of objects . I am very careful about not overloading a show with one particular kind of merchandise , and I am careful about how I place dealers on the floor . I try to keep a show balanced and pretty - and a lot of prices within affordable reach of a lot of people . I avoid a high and mighty approach because I think people want to come in and buy and not just look. ' ' // Mr. Coger ' s next show , the Spalding Antiques Show in Denver , Aug. 26 , 27 , and 28 , will benefit a rehabilition hospital . He is already working on 1984 shows in Dallas ; New Orleans ; Tulsa , Okla. ; and Midland , Texas , to benefit other organizations , such as symphony orchestras and community theaters. // Both Mr. Coger and Mr. Carrell note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country means that many areas are being exposed to a far broader range of fine antiques than ever before . Dealers are spending large sums to transport their wares to distant cities and to rent booths and hotel rooms for themselves . One Massachusetts dealer exhibiting at the Dallas show said it cost $5 , 000 to bring himself and his goods to the show . He said it was worth it , though , in increased sales and exposure to new customers in a growing part of the country. // ' ' We find a very sophisticated clientele in Texas these days , ' ' the dealer commented , ' ' and so we bring to Dallas our finest pieces , including Early American , European , and Oriental . ' ' Many good dealers each year manage a far-flung circuit , which may begin at the Ellis Memorial Show in Boston and circle out to include New York , Philadelphia , Chicago , Dallas , and the West Coast . The antique show sponsored to raise funds for a worthy cause has encouraged such extensive peregrinations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a four-year hiatus , an international antique market of note , the Grosvenor House Antiques Fair in London , reopened with fanfare on June 9 to run through June 18 . Eighty-five leading British dealers provided a glittering array of goods , and the preview gala and ball was staged to benefit London ' s Westminster Hospital. // //
