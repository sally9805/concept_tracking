The analysis , prepared by the Congressional Research Service , says mobile missiles " eliminate a known number of precisely located targets for enemy marksmen to hit , " while airborne or seaborne missiles would escape enemy barrages that " might blanket suspected hiding places in the United States. " // One option described in the report would place missiles on amphibious aircraft that would fly at random over the ocean and touch down in calm seas to save fuel . Another would use ships or planes to dump floating canisters containing the missiles into the ocean , where firing could be triggered later by remote control. // // Land Basing Is Vulnerable // The research agency prepares a wide range of reports with facts , analysis and alternatives for members of Congress , but it makes no recommendations . It is staffed with professional analysts and is considered by members of Congress to be impartial and reliable. // The new analysis reflects a widening perception that no stationary , undefended land base for MX missiles would be secure from attack . The Joint Chiefs of Staff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any land base would be vulnerable. // The research report , moreover , comes as debate over the MX , for missile experimental , is about to resume . After Congress withheld production funds for the missile in December , Mr. Reagan appointed a commission to recommend new proposals for the President to submit to Congress . <> <> Congressional Chances Weighed // The deadline for the commission headed by Lieut . Gen. Brent Scowcroft was extended from Feb. 18 to April 15 as it has been unable yet to resolve political or military objections to every base suggested so far from more than 175 witnesses , most of whom have advocated known basing schemes. // Therefore Congress , to which the new analysis is directed , has become the key to the commission ' s considerations , the officials there said . They said the commission has turned to finding out what has the best chance of Congressional acceptance when the President submits a new proposal in the spring. // While reflecting a spreading skepticism about land bases , the Congressional Research Service analysis will undoubtedly be disputed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force , which would deploy the missiles if Congress votes to continue the program , has so far argued against all but land bases . The Air Force is concerned that it might lose control of the missiles to the Navy if the MX was based at sea . <> <> Triad Concept Defended // The new analysis , written by John M. Collins , a senior specialist on national security in the research service , says the concept behind the present triad of bombers , intercontinental missiles and submarine-launched missiles should be retained . But he contends that " every triad leg could be aloft , ashore or afloat if the resultant combination satisfied United States security requirements. " // Mr. Collins , who said in an interview that his task was to provide options for Congress , rather than to advocate solutions , said many military thinkers , such as Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor , a former chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff , held that " land basing for the MX missile is no longer practical. " // In his analysis , Mr. Collins says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missile warheads as the Strategic Air Command has missile silos . " Because those silos are stationary , he says , they " are the easiest of all systems to hit. " // The Administration has proposed , and the President ' s commission has considered , putting MX missiles in existing Minuteman silos . The new analysis , however , asserts that " replacing Minuteman missiles with MX would merely provide Soviet marksmen with more lucrative targets . " <> <> Miscalculation Possible // The closely spaced basing plan proposed by the Administration but disapproved by Congress assumes that Soviet planners accept the theory of " fratricide , " in which incoming nuclear warheads blow each other up , and therefore would be deterred from striking , Mr. Collins writes . He contends that " the margin for miscalculation consequently is considerable. " // " Pentagon strategists could never be certain that Soviet leaders concur with their conclusions , even if all relevant files were declassified and flown to Moscow via Federal Express , " he says. // A semimobile basing plan is not much better , in Mr. Collins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " drag strips , " in which missiles are shuttled from shelter to shelter , would be acceptable " only if true target locations remain secret and total shelters exceed the Soviet stock of lethal weapons. " // " In any event , " he writes , " the proliferation of known aiming points on American soil could invite saturation attacks of much greater magnitude than the Soviets would now need to swamp existing United States silos if deterrence failed . " <> <> Armadillos , Gulls and Hydras // In contrast , Mr. Collins maintains , mobile missiles mounted on trucks , trains or other land vehicles could not all be hit , even in a barrage . The President ' s commission has considered a small missile carried on an armored vehicle called an " armadillo. " // " But political opposition to nuclear weapons roaming public roads and rail lines is particularly strong , " Mr. Collins writes . Turning to seaborne bases other than the present submarine force of Poseidon and Trident missiles , Mr. Collins asserted that a plan called Hydra " is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in buoyant canisters that would be dumped from ships " to float free in times of crises , far from the carriers and each other . " Firing would be triggered from a remote ship or shore position . If the threat receded , the canisters would be recovered in a short time . Ships carrying the missiles could fool satellite sensors but not close observation , he says , and the canisters could be found by Soviet ships. // A combined sea-air option , Mr. Collins writes , is an amphibious aircraft called Sea-sitter . The plane carrying missiles would take off from a land base , fly over the ocean and touch down on calm seas at random to save fuel . Then the plane would take off for another place selected at random , making tracking nearly impossible . Missiles would be launched in flight or from canisters dropped into the sea. //
