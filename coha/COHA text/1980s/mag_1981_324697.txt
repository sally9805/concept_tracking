After allowing stirrings of protest , the government turns tough <P> The charges ring disturbingly of the past : " Brazenly opposing the party 's leadership , deviating from the orbit of socialism , desiring and envying the decadent , bourgeois way of life in the West . " These and similar superheated phrases appearing in the Chinese press these days recall the years when the late Mao Tse-tung carried out his frenzied and reckless campaigns for ideological purity in China . Though the more moderate post-Mao leadership in Peking had repeatedly promised not to resume such repression , the official press has recently bristled with attacks on people who are said to hold " corrosive , erroneous ideas " and to fan " aimless , evil winds . " Having lived through the Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976 and other waves of terror against individualism , many Chinese are bracing themselves for a new political campaign designed to impose obedience to the Communist Party 's dictates . <P> It was Deputy Party Chairman Deng Xiaoping , China 's most powerful leader , who had permitted a modicum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched his shortlived " Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom " movement in 1957 . Now Deng too has had second thoughts about the first faint burgeonings of freedom he inspired . Lately Deng has complained that the relative relaxation of recent years has led to a host of " unhealthy tendencies , " most notably in literature and art . The press has referred darkly to the emergence of an artistic " counterculture " and complained of stories and plays that " propagate pessimism , nihilism and ultraindividualism , " meaning in Deng 's words , " opposition to the leadership of the party . " In the spring , Bai Hua , a well-known writer , was viciously attacked by the Liberation Army Daily for a screenplay called Bitter Love that , the paper charged , showed " hatred for our party and our socialist motherland . " More ominously , say Chinese sources , Deng has named at least ten writers who will be singled out in the months ahead as targets of a national campaign of " criticism and self-criticism . " <P> Even Chinese leaders , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce nothing like the sweeping repression of the past , when tens of thousands were indiscriminately shipped off to labor camps or killed . Nor does it seem that China 's leaders are preparing to impose anything like the absolute uniformity in literature and art that was ordained during the Cultural Revolution . But the new crackdown has had a dampening effect on many writers and artists who had been hoping that the government would allow ever greater degrees of free expression . <P> The repression began early this year when the Communist Party embarked on a no-nonsense effort to crush the stubborn remains of the " democracy movement " that had flourished in 1978 and 1979 . Most of the activities , particularly putting up posters on Peking 's " democracy wall , " had already been banned by the party in 1980 . Several of the liberals ' most articulate spokesmen were arrested that year , including Liu Qing , deputy editor of the most widely circulated underground journal , April 5th Forum .                @ @ @ @ @
