Unfortunately , there ' s no time to stop and gaze at the luminous curls and twists . It ' s only a minute or two until the opening curtain for ' ' Truffles in the Soup , ' ' and it would be bad form for a visiting reporter to miss the first act. // Settling into a plush seat , I ' m struck by the handsome stage set , re-creating a street from New York City ' s ' ' Little Italy ' ' - the locale for a contemporary farce , which borrows its social conscience , down-and-out street characters , and mistaken identities from an 18th-century Italian comedy. // This richly detailed scene is truly extraordinary . Even if this year ' s Pulitzer Prize and the Tony Award for best play hadn ' t been given to a drama first produced on this stage - Wendy Wasserstein ' s ' ' The Heidi Chronicles ' ' - the scenery alone would signal that the dramatic arts get special nurturing here at the home of the Seattle Repertory Theatre. // // The Rep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' unparalleled in the care and feeding of new plays , ' ' playwright Herb Gardner noted at a luncheon a couple days after the ' ' Truffles ' ' performance . Mr. Gardner ' s ' ' I ' m Not Rappaport ' ' was developed and premiered here before moving on to New York and winning the 1986 Tony for best drama . According to Gardner , the play might never have been produced at all without the Rep ' s interest and help. // Wendy Wasserstein , too , praised Mr. Sullivan and the Rep in her Tony acceptance speech last week for the year of effort the company put into her play. // But surprisingly , artistic director Sullivan says the crafting of Broadway hits is not the Rep ' s mission . In a conversation in his spacious office , the director , who came to this city 10 years ago from Lincoln Center , explained , ' ' I keep stressing that the nonprofit regional theaters were inaugurated as an alternative to the commercial theater . They were an attempt to provide communities like ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus is the development of a good acting company. ' ' // The local community has warmly embraced the 26-year-old Rep. About 80 percent of the tickets , representing some 23 , 000 seats , are snapped up by season subscribers . Yet ticket sales pay only 62 percent of the company ' s costs . Gifts , grants , and other income make up the difference . So when a Rep play transfers to Broadway , can ' t the added revenue chip away at the company deficit ? // ' ' With ' The Heidi Chronicles , ' the theater participates in the profits only through my directorial royalties , ' ' Sullivan explains . ' ' With ' Eastern Standard ' ( another play on Broadway that was developed at the Rep ) , there was a contract that allowed the theater to participate to some degree through box office revenues . But it ' s a very small amount of money unless the play is an enormous success . The standard for most theaters is one-half of 1 percent of the gross and a small percentage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it as a reliable means of revenue . We ' re a nonprofit organization , meaning that we raise a good deal of money from public and private sources . If the public and private sources get the idea that we can raise our own money through successes of that kind , we are in trouble . That ' s strictly a seasonal thing . It can happen one year , and if it doesn ' t happen the next , you ' re wiped out. ' ' // According to Sullivan , success in the commercial theater presents artistic as well as financial challenges . ' ' Part of the attraction for playwrights to bring a play here was that we were out of the limelight. . . , ' ' he explains . ' ' Now , when we decide to do a workshop , that decision appears in the New York Times . The playwright comes out here because of the need for privacy , and the privacy is interrupted . The attention is good , but it ' s also somewhat dangerous for the theater. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was written by Sullivan and the company because they wanted an original work to end the ' 88-89 season . It is based loosely on Carlo Goldoni ' s ' ' The Servant of Two Masters . ' ' Sullivan wrote the first act with the strengths of the 14-performer company in mind . ' ' We slammed the second act together as we went , ' ' he says. // The result is a play with the wit , topical references , playful digs at audiences , and implausible plot twists that will please any fan of farce . The action revolves around Truffles , a dropout from the Yale Drama School who is now a homeless street person and who insists there ' s a theater audience where everyone else sees only a parking lot . But never mind ; Truffles ' s immediate goal in life is to find a meal. // Describing his inspiration for the script , Sullivan recalls , ' ' I was walking down a street in New York , and there was a street person who was a talker . He sounded absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought : What if I were crazy and his reality were true ? // ' ' I wanted it to be funny , ' ' continues Sullivan , ' ' but I also wanted to deal with the fact that so many homeless people on New York streets are there because they ' ve been turned out of mental hospitals . As in most other comedies , the components of the play are possibly very grim . The whole play is propelled by the audience ' s understanding of this man ' s hunger - by believing in it just as firmly as they believe in Chaplin ' s hunger in ' The Gold Rush , ' where he eats a shoe. ' ' // Truffles comes poignantly close to dining while in the employ of both a young woman named Beatrice , who disguises herself as her deceased brother in order to collect a debt owed to him , and a young tough named Angelo , Beatrice ' s forsaken and forlorn lover , who for a time believes she is dead. // The subplot involves Benito Pataloni , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissuading his own daughter from marrying an unworthy suitor and his wife from pursuing practically every character who wears pants ( including the disguised Beatrice ) . There ' s also a restaurateur who stocks his larder from a garbage can and a warmhearted bag lady who belts out London music hall ditties. // Though the Rep adaptation blunts some of the social commentary Goldini aimed at the callousness of the upper classes , the audience does feel for Truffles and the way their own selfish pursuits keep others from responding to his plight. // John Procaccino is perfect in the title role , using superb comic timing and skillfully inflected asides to capture Truffles ' s wavering hope and frustration . Jeannie Carson delivers a strong performance as the sometimes sympathetic bag lady , and Barbara Dirickson relishes the various challenges of playing a woman who impersonates a man . Fine ensemble acting from the rest of the cast , and an impromptu performance from an unsuspecting member of the audience keep the evening moving at an antic pace . Douglas W. Schmidt designed the effective set , Pat Collins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Sullivan , who directed , considers the work done so far with ' ' Truffles ' ' to be ' ' just kind of a first step . More important than that audiences enjoy it is that we ' ve taken this step of working together as a company . We ' ve gotten to know each other a little better. ' ' // At the Rep , developing the relationships that oil the pursuit of exceptional artistry at every level is what it ' s all about. // The Rep will take ' ' Truffles ' ' to San Diego to open the Old Globe Theatre ' s 1990 season. // Dramatic growth in Seattle ' s cultural scene prompted the Monitor to send arts editor Bruce Manuel there to sample the city ' s arts organizations . This is the first of several reports from that trip. // //
