Donald and Natalie Granato have experienced their share of red-letter dates , as would any parents of an Olympic hockey hero . But they ' ve got their eyes on another possibility . " March 30 , " says Mom . " The New York Rangers play the Blackhawks in Chicago Stadium . That would be nice . " They should be permitted to dream on , should Donald and Natalie , because their son Tony has a way of turning these fantasies into realities . Tony was about age 6 , they recall , when he first stumbled about the rink at Elmhurst ' s YMCA , a kid on blades that zigged while he zagged . Little could this tightly knit unit from Downers Grove have imagined that the oldest of six children would skate before the world . " I was numb when it finally happened , " says Donald after watching Tony collect three assists Saturday night in Team USA ' s 10-6 victory over Austria in its opener at the XV Winter Games . Not that the triumph was either artistic or auspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday evening against Czechoslovakia , which must atone for an upsetting loss to West Germany or perish . " Too many lapses , " rues Tony , a 23-year-old winger , of his squad ' s checkered effort in the Saddledome . Then again , if the Americans ' checking wasn ' t as tight as the Americans ' muscles , it was understandable . The arena was full of friends and flags and families , including the Granatos . Tony ' s sisters , Cammi and Tina , were there , as was brother Joe , and Robbie is due in from O ' Hare any moment now . Don won ' t make it , for he ' s too busy centering for the University of Wisconsin , where Tony polished his wheels . " We ' re big on hockey , " understates Tony , " and big on being together . " Ordinarily , at an event of such magnitude , the large Granato contingent would have been forced to scatter . But when Mom and Dad got an inkling that Tony would be among the honored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied for the Olympic adopt-a-parent plan . Bart and Lorette Van Staalduinen wrote a 10-page letter of introduction , by way of saying their home some 10 miles outside Calgary was open . Being typical ambassadors of their friendly nation , the Canadians did not restrict the rent-a-guest list to two . " So we ' re all here in this one house , " says Natalie . " And it ' s like these people have been our neighbors in Chicago forever . It ' s wonderful . And all we can do to reciprocate is offer to pay the check when we go out to dinner . " Of course , Mom and Dad Granato have picked up a fair number of tabs in their time . Don is with the family business , Grant Importing in Broadview , a beer and liquor distributorship . They don ' t talk much about making sacrifices , but they don ' t have to , because Tony does . Whenever he discusses the long and wavy path he navigated to become a U.S. Olympian , he invariably hones in on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know the old saw : Don ' t drop your kid off at the rink , bring him to the rink . " They ' ve driven all over to watch me play , " Tony says . " Three hours here , four hours there . And my freshman year at Downers Grove North High School , when my grades slipped because I ' m playing 100 games in one winter with three different leagues , they send me to prep school in Lake Placid , N.Y. That ' s $8 , 500 a year for two years , a pretty big hit in a large family like ours . But they were always behind me . They were always behind all of us . I ' m not the only one . My brothers and sisters play , too . " Tony did not lack for backing elsewhere . He wears No. 21 because his idol is Stan Mikita , a Blackhawk Hall of Famer whom Tony met at the annual summer school for the hearing impaired , one of Mikita ' s priorities . And it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony to Mikita ' s school . Gunzo was the longtime equipment supplier for the Blackhawks and the man who first adjusted Tony ' s skates when he took that first staccato whirl around the pond in Elmhurst at age 6 , an Olympian aborning . " It was Gunzo who called us from the NHL draft a few years ago , " Dad mentions . " He was up there in Toronto when Tony was picked by the New York Rangers . Gunzo was so excited , he could hardly talk . Would he ever be happy now if he was here . " Tony Granato and his family are taking it one dream at a time . He ' s not a hulking sort at 5 feet 10 inches and 185 pounds , but he ' s gifted with a nice touch around the net and good instincts . Dave Peterson , the U.S. coach , figures Tony isn ' t likely to skate over any of those 220-pound defensemen in the NHL . " But , " adds Peterson , " he ' s a great kid with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to do the things he does best . He ' s played all over the world , and the more experience he ' s gotten , the better player Tony ' s become . Don ' t know that you could improve on him as a person . " The American hockey players have some mountains to climb at these Winter Games , all indoors . After the Czechs , it will be the Soviets Wednesday night . Canada is good , Sweden is excellent , the USA is a longshot for a medal . But somehow , it will all work out for Tony Granato . In June , he will marry Linda Mohs , and if he isn ' t a Ranger by then , perhaps he will consider playing hockey in Europe for a spell . All those hours of practice and travel will prove worthwhile . They already have . " Oh , Natalie and I on occasion talk about the house on the lake that we ' d like , " admits Dad . " You say with what we ' ve spent on hockey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , too ? Maybe , but so what . You can ' t buy what we saw Saturday night over there at the Saddledome . You know , all during those exhibition games , it ' s just the USA jersey Tony ' s wearing , it ' s not the Olympics . But this is official . This is the Olympics . I tell you , I was numb .
