" It was a little bit of a culture shock , " said Fran Girolamo , a Bankers Trust employee here . She works in the $75 million converted cold-storage warehouse that is only one train stop on the PATH system from its Wall Street offices but in the decaying industrial area dominated by an aging Colgate factory and an abandoned power plant. // She wistfully recalled the shopping concourse of the World Trade Center , the midday concerts in the World Financial Center and the excitement of afterwork parties at the South Street Seaport. // // Busy Promenade // But in the three years since the move , Bankers Trust workers and officials have found that the isolation has ended and efforts to import some big-city ambiance seem to have succeeded. // " You have to create your own environment , " said Charles N. Nobs , a senior vice president of the bank. // A new riverside promenade now swarms with office workers . A shuttle bus idles in nearby Exchange Place as shoppers climb aboard for quick midday jaunts to the nearby Newport Centre shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority the permanence of the changes . <> <> Wall Street West // " One thing triggers another , " Mr. Nobs said . " The area has been recognized across the spectrum as a good place to do business. " // Wall Street West , as the Jersey City shoreline is being called , is a major destination for financial concerns as Manhattan ' s crowded business district continues to spill over its natural aquatic borders. // National Westminster Bank of London is building a riverfront home here for its domestic subsidiary , the First Jersey Bank , next door to Bankers Trust . Harborside , the office complex envisioned as growing up around Bankers Trust , is to include three towers of 40 stories or more . Part of Donaldson , Lufkin &; Jenrette , the investment banking concern , is preparing to move into a 20-story building that is nearing completion atop the Pavonia rail station , one stop on PATH from the Exchange Place station. // Foreign concerns like Daiwa Securities and the Royal Bank of Canada have been drawn to Jersey City by the quick rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering a move that would take 4 , 000 jobs there. // The changes radiate in every direction from the waterfront . Old residential neighborhoods in Jersey City and nearby Hoboken are undergoing a renaissance. // Newport , an embryonic complex of shops , offices and high-rise apartments pressed up near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel , is already alive with joggers , clusters of skinny trees and brigades of briefcase-toters . <> <> Crowds-on-Hudson // The entire riverfront area south of the Lincoln Tunnel is the focus of feverish speculation. // Curiously , the growth is now producing complaints among those who hated the isolation . Some workers in the eight-story Bankers Trust building are complaining of having their views of the Statue of Liberty blocked by the new Westminster building . And parking has become a problem. // But the transformation can hardly come fast enough for others who once worked in Manhattan . " I prefer New York , " said James Beit , an assistant treasurer who lives on Manhattan ' s East 79th Street . " The food is better . The atmosphere is better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chase ' s arrival , hoping it will relieve the work-a-day humdrum of the last three years . " It ' s almost like being in high school , " said Jerome Stennis , who has worked in the pension management section for 18 years . " You see the same people over and over . " <> <> Reverse Commuting // The list of complaints from New Yorkers is varied . Like New Jersey residents who work in New York , they loathe the income-tax deductions by authorities in both New Jersey and New York. // Commuting can be a trial , especially bumping into New Jersey residents as they scurry on and off the trains in the opposite direction. // Residents of Manhattan say the move has added about 15 minutes each way to their daily commuting time . Some New Jerseyans , of course , found their trips reduced. // Bankers Trust is paying commuters who were transferred $750 a year for five years to compensate for any increased commuting costs . Company-inspired car pools from Brooklyn and Staten Island have all but vanished because riders failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The major malaise among the relocated , however , is nostalgia for the big city . And many employees take the 10-minute ride on PATH back to the World Trade Center shopping concourse at lunchtime. // The paucity of good restaurants is a universal grievance . It is also one that the bank anticipated . To help the situation , it created an elegant 350- seat cafeteria with a marvelous picture-frame view of the the World Trade Center and the World Financial Center. // Still , the bank ' s cafeteria leaves some of its captive customers yearning for a freer lunch market . " It looks nice but they serve the same thing every day , " Mr. Beit complained. // For some New Jerseyans the arrival of the New Yorkers has presented some opportunites . " Since the bank has been here a lot of people who didn ' t have jobs have gotten jobs , " said Jean Miller , a lifelong Jersey City resident . She was a temporary receptionist for a year and a half before getting a permanent job in the securities lending department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job in Manhattan to join Bankers Trust . A New Jersey resident , her commuting time has been cut by more than a half-hour to 45 minutes. // New Jersey residents now , because of transfers and newly hired employees , comprise 40 percent of a work force of 1 , 300 . Three years ago only 10 percent of 1 , 000 lived in New Jersey. // Bankers Trust officials , too , are happy . Bargain rental rates , the result of concessions for becoming " anchor " tenants in the Harborside complex , save the company $6 million a year on rent alone. // There are savings on energy costs and sales taxes as well . Bankers Trust , responding to a systemwide edict from the Federal Reserve Board to duplicate all bank records , installed three floors of energy-hungry computer equipment at Harborside . Its electric rates , according to the bank , are as low as 50 percent of what it would pay in Manhattan. // New York City did not even try to contest those savings . " Neither before our decision nor after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to change our minds , " Mr. Nobs said. // The city has come a long way since then . It is trying to convince Chase to cross the East River to Brooklyn instead of forsaking the city by crossing the Hudson. // The city is offering Chase a package of inducements , including tax subsidies and reduced energy costs. //
