Teachers didn ' t have adequate access to supplies . There was little discipline in the classroom ; no evaluation process ; no time for teachers to reflect on their subject ; parental indifference ; little collegiality ; constant interruptions ; minimal coaching ; and the average principal was , as in the limerick , ' ' the man who wasn ' t there. ' ' // // Mr. Nilsson is a manager ' s manager . He helps head up Hewlett-Packard ' s prestigious ( and fast-lane ) Palo Alto corporate training division . Here , among the hierarchy-defying chest-high office partitions made famous in Silicon Valley , Nilsson ' s boss put the phrase ' ' managing by wandering around ' ' on the business management map . The entrepreneurial bible of the 1980s , ' ' In Search of Excellence , ' ' lists HP as one of its 10 model ' ' excellent ' ' companies. // For private-sector participants like Nilsson , the commission on teaching was an eye-opener . ' ' I consider myself to be an average Californian , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile indicate a man who knows and lives by the quick decision . ' ' I graduated from public high schools in California . And though I heard there were problems with the schools today , I just couldn ' t believe what I saw. ' ' // If Nilsson sounds pessimistic , just the opposite is true . He sees the commission , and the detailed reform efforts ( which include upgrading teacher recruitment , salaries , and school curriculum ) by public school superintendent Bill Honig and his staff , as ' ' a very hopeful thing ' ' in the California system , a system that will teach 15 percent of the nation ' s schoolchildren by 1990. // Part of what Nilsson saw took place at what was described to him as one of the better elementary schools in inner-city San Francisco . Although it wasn ' t the rule , Nilsson says his experience with this school was not the exception , either. // Nilsson asked the principal , who had been there seven years , if she had received training for her job . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teacher . One day , she received a phone call out of the blue telling her she was the new principal. // ' ' I was surprised , ' ' Nilsson says , ' ' because obviously I believe in some kind of training - not that it guarantees anything - but it ' s a lot harder when you learn it on your own. ' ' // Nilsson observed a third-grade class from 9 : 45 in the morning to 2 : 30 - 31 children in a typical ratio for San Francisco city schools : 60 percent Asian , a single Caucasian , and the rest black and Hispanic. // Even in Nilsson ' s somewhat authoritative presence , the class was out of control . ' ' Maintaining order in the class was everything . . . occasionally the teacher was able to get some meaningful learning in. ' ' // One child in the class erased the blackboard whenever the teacher wasn ' t looking . When he went back to his desk , the child spent his time poking pencils through a cardboard box . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal , once by being carried. // Another child spent his time gleefully hiding from the teacher in the back of the room . ' ' If that child learned anything , I ' d be surprised , ' ' Nilsson says. // Meanwhile , the learning that was going on took place at every ability level . One child , just arrived from Hong Kong , spoke no English and had to be helped individually . Other kids tried doing math problems written on the blackboard being erased by the troublemaker . ' ' It was a three-ring circus , ' ' Nilsson says. // At the end of the session , Nilsson was worn out ; his idea of the job teachers face today had gone through an abrupt turnabout. // According to Gary Sykes , research chairman of the commission , the public doesn ' t have ' ' a clue , not a clue , ' ' about the teaching profession today. // ' ' The businessmen on the panel , ' ' Mr. Sykes says , were ' ' amazed ' ' at the conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s so far from what they know to be necessary to get people motivated that they are shocked - they can ' t believe it. ' ' // Nilsson states : ' ' Not that evee courage , but if every Californian could spend even one day in a public school , they would be in an uproar . They would demand something be done. ' ' // From a business point of view , one of the main critiques Nilsson makes is the ' ' span of control ' ' problem . In most schools , the central manager - the principal - has over 20 teachers to deal with . ' ' How do you provide any decent coaching or dialogue with that many people reporting to you ? ' ' Nilsson asks. // ' ' I have seven people reporting to me , including a secretary , and I don ' t find enough time to spend one on one as I would like . To multiply that by three . . . is absurd . My counterparts on the committee from business and industry feel the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer who is vice-chairman of the commission , says the businessmen on the panel helped bring perspective to the problem of attracting new teachers today by pointing out the contrast between ' ' the aggressive , imaginative recruitment practices in modern business ' ' and the state school system in which ' ' new teachers are given the least attractive classroom at the far end of the hallway. ' ' // Nilsson condemns the common ' ' sink or swim ' ' practice of putting untried teachers directly into a classroom situation . ' ' Most education schools don ' t teach you how to maintain order - you learn that on the job . ' ' In industry , by contrast , ' ' we wouldn ' t think of throwing a person into a similar role without having a lot of coaching from someone who understands the problems. ' ' // One solution Nilsson offers for present teacher woes is for schools to have , essentially , two principals - one to focus on teachers and learning , and one to handle the physical plant , community relations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , ' ' busy themselves in administrative minutiae . ' ' They are forced to ' ' worry about heating in the school . . . rather than paying attention to the real role of the school - which , as ( leading educator ) Ted Sizer testified to our commission , is to teach kids to use their minds. ' ' // At bottom , Nilsson feels teachers themselves may contribute the most to the improvement of the California school system . He is impressed by the fact that teachers are more concerned about changing their working conditions than their salary ( though he concedes salary is very important ) . // ' ' Actually , ' ' he says , ' ' the amazing thing is that , given their situation , so many teachers have remained in the system. ' ' // All the more reason , he says , for principals , school boards , and parents to pay attention to teacher needs : ' ' Every good manager knows that your real strength is in the people you have working for you . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you work on those areas in which your people can be more successful. ' ' // // // //
