" If people make behavioral changes without changing their internal values , beliefs and attitudes , the new behaviors are less likely to stick when the external supports disappear , " the specialist , Dr. Lawrence W. Green , said in an interview . Dr. Green , who is director of the Center for Health Promotion Research and Development at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston , said an analysis of his own research and other recent studies suggests that health promotion efforts have relied too much on peer groups , social pressures and even financial incentives to influence behavior. // " I ' m developing a growing concern about the gimmickry used in a lot of programs , " Dr. Green said . " As soon as the peer group disappears or is no longer forced to behave in a certain way , the pressure is off the individual and he reverts back to his bad habits. " // Dr. Green says this is why people who participate in weight-loss or stop-smoking groups so often relapse after leaving the group . As he explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an artificial , temporary group of people brought together without any relationship to each other except for their shared health problem . When the group ends , each participant goes back to his own environment without those strong social supports. " // One of the few groups with a high degree of lasting success is Alcoholics Anonymous . " A.A. is unique because it is not a transitory group , " Dr. Green said . " Individuals make a deep , lifelong commitment , not ' I ' ll try this for awhile and see if it works . ' " Even those who leave A.A. often join some other organization that supports their continued sobriety. // Though Dr. Green ' s observations may sound like common sense , he said that in the decades since the theories of B.F. Skinner gained dominance in behavioral psychology , " values , attitudes and beliefs have been neglected as factors that are important " in changing behavior . " But when a person is left to his own devices , that ' s what he must fall back on , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supportive for people who have already undergone a conversion of values , beliefs and attitudes . But , he added : " If you ' re using the group in order to instigate conversion , it becomes a coercive process . You ' re not following the dictates of your own conscience so much as you are conforming to the group. " // The same is true in the case of a " significant other " who instigates the behavioral change . " A significant other can be a powerful stimulus for behavioral change , " Dr. Green said . " But if you are taking action merely because someone else wanted you to , you ' re not doing it because you wanted to , and you are much less likely to persist in that change . " <> <> Results Prove Short-Lived // He cited a study of 400 patients suffering from high blood pressure . The purpose of the study , conducted at Johns Hopkins University , was to determine what best prompted patients to comply with the prescribed treatment . One group attended explanatory sessions with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third , a counselor made a home visit with a family member who had influence on the patient. // " In the short run , the home visit was most effective , " Dr. Green said . " After two years , these patients complied best with the medical regimen and prescribed diet , kept more of their follow-up appointments and achieved the best blood pressure control . " But in the long run , five years later , those in this group " had the worst medical record , " he said. // In another study , of women attending a family planning clinic in Pakistan , those who came at the urging of a personal friend or family member were less likely to return than those who came on their own in response to an advertisement for the clinic. // " When you bypass the patient himself as the target of the education , you set the person up for long-term failure because there is no underlying change in the person ' s belief system , " Dr. Green said. // He explained that people typically influence each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the reciprocal relationship , you do what another person wants you to do because you want to maintain the relationship : " I do this for you because you do something else for me . " In the second , you mimic the behavior of someone you admire . This occurs , for example , among teen-agers who mimic idols or children who copy their parents ' behavior . It is also the principle underlying the effectiveness of many advertisements , such as for Virginia Slims or Marlboro cigarettes. // But when trying to use the influence of personal identification to change bad health habits , the gimmick can backfire , Dr. Green said . " The individual may get angry or disillusioned with the role model or , as soon as that model is out of sight , substitute another . " <> <> Undermining Long-Term Success // " I ' m afraid that the more we depend on such expedient methods for achieving behavioral changes , the more we may be undermining long-term success , " he said. // As for the nagging spouse , Dr. Green said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The person under pressure to change may think of reasons that the desired action is not possible , and with each subsequent urging , the person reinforces his belief that change is impossible. // The " internal " conversion that is most likely to result in lasting changes in health-damaging behavior starts with a belief in susceptibility , Dr. Green said . " The person has to get beyond anonymous statistics to realize that this could happen to him , " he said . Next comes a belief in the severity of the problem , that it is something worth worrying about . Finally comes the belief that what you do about the problem will accomplish the desired health-preserving effect. // For most people , Dr. Green noted , " health is not a ' terminal ' value , an end in itself . " Rather , ' he said : " People are concerned about health in order to be more attractive , more effective , more competitive and less dependent . Health has to be attached to values that are already important to the individual. " // Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while a powerful expedient in changing behavior , is often not conducive to lasting change . Two examples are seat-belt use and cleaning up after one ' s dog , both of which have declined since the laws first took effect . " Even if it ' s a law , people still need to internalize its value , " Dr. Green said . <> <> Those Who React Early // On a societal level , Dr. Green said , many people change their health behaviors simply on the basis of warnings and guidelines given in the mass media . These " early adopters , " as he called them , tend to be more affluent , better educated and more trusting of the media . Among these are the millions of people who quit smoking on their own after the first spate of reports on the health hazards of smoking or the people who seek vaccines in response to media advertising. // The " late adopters , " on the other hand , tend to distrust or ignore the media . Dr. Green described them as more suspicious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to mass communications . " These people need to be approached on a more individualized level , often through community-based opinion leaders , " the researcher said. // Dr. Green said that this characteristic of late adopters greatly increases the difficulties facing public health workers . " It is widely believed that the commercial , Madison Avenue approach is much more effective because it is more creative , " Dr. Green commented . " But in fact , commercial ventures reach a different audience , " one that is more likely to respond rapidly to puported advantages to changing health-related behaviors . <> <> Changing Behavior of Laggards // Public health programs , on the other hand , go after the laggards , those who are much harder to convince . It costs more to reach them , it takes longer to accomplish the desired goal and the percentage gains are likely to be smaller , Dr. Green said. // And while a commercially induced change that increases the number of adopters from , say , 20 percent to 30 percent represents a percentage gain of 50 percent , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a 20 percent gain , even though the actual numbers of new adopters is the same. // " Public Health agencies have been given a bad rap , " Dr. Green said . " They ' re working at the toughest end of the curve , and a 10 percentage point change at the 50 percent level should be worth more than a 10 percentage point change at the 20 percent level.
