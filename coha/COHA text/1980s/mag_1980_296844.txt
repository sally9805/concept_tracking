Reprieve for Civil War dead <P> Retired Chemical Engineer Charles Albright , 62 , had been a navigator on a B-29 bomber in World War II , and , as he began planning for his own funeral , he recalled the Federal Government 's promise that every war veteran could be buried in a national cemetery . The only such cemetery in his native West Virginia is in the town of Grafton , which suited Albright perfectly because his parents and grandparents are buried near by . But when he first inquired five years ago about a plot for himself , he learned that the three-acre Grafton National Cemetery had been full ever since 1957 . Says Al bright : " I was real disappointed . That 's where I wanted to be buried .

So what 's wrong with a common grave as long as you just do n't pile them in all together ? " <P> The VA explored the possibility of carrying out similar exhumations elsewhere . Said Carl T. Noll , chief memorial affairs director : " The consolidation of graves would provide a reasonably significant number of gravesites to meet today 's needs . " In fact , of the 109 national cemeteries operated by the VA , only 55 can accommodate new graves . <P> But the VA failed to anticipate the outburst of public criticism . The New York Times accused the VA of " trampling on the final resting places . " " Let them rest in peace , " said the Washington Post . <P> Last week the VA canceled the project . Said a chastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valiant Civil War heroes . " <P> That leaves Albright still looking for a grave . While the VA promises " to explore other possible ways to create additional gravesites , " Albright 's committee has already begun a $500,000 fund-raising drive to buy the land needed to expand the Grafton cemetery . The unknown soldiers will remain where they are .
