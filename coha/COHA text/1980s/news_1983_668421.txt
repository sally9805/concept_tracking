Ron Meyer talked a lot yesterday about changing . He told many of his players that some things they didn ' t like this season might be different next year . He told the media he learned a lot in 1983 , and that he would assess some of the controversial measures he took this year , " but not all of them . " But in the most important moment of the day for the Patriots , he told John Hannah that if being traded is what John Hannah really wants , he would be traded . And it is what Hannah really wants . " Myself and the rest of the people in the organization hope that John Hannah finishes out his career with the Patriots , " Meyer said after meeting with Hannah and a dozen other players individually during the morning . " Like I said before , he is the best football player I have ever been around , and when I was with Dallas we had a guy named Bob Lilly , who is in the Hall of Fame . " Meyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , if he doesn ' t change his mind , will also ask to be traded today when he has his individual session with the coach . Morgan said yesterday he wanted to take another day to get all of his thoughts together before meeting with Meyer to tell him how he felt . Among the players Meyer met with yesterday were Pete Brock and Don Hasselbeck . " He thanked me for playing hard and playing hurt during the year , " said Brock , who will have surgery on his shoulder in the near future . " He said he felt I played well enough to make the Pro Bowl . I appreciated that . I told him I also appreciated some of the things he did for the players , getting a better weightlifting area built and making the medical situation better . " I also told him what I didn ' t like - that I didn ' t like getting to know Ron Meyer in the newspaper . I told him there was a lack of communication between him and the players . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the papers , from what he told the sportswriters was on his mind . I suggested that if he had things to say about the squad , it would have been better saying them to the squad first . " That was the big point I wanted to make . He said that maybe I was right , and that in the future he would try to have better communication with the players . " Hasselbeck , who had been very vocal about Meyer during much of the season , felt he had a fine meeting with the coach . " I told him how I felt about things . I made some mistakes . Maybe we overreacted to some of the rules he made and things he did . I just thought that some of the veterans didn ' t need all of those rules , but when I saw the way some of the young guys acted once in a while , maybe we did need some of those rules to keep them in line . " My contract is up , and I am negotiating with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meyer . He said the Patriots were going to extend a qualifying offer to keep my rights in the league . Ron told me that his feelings right now were that he wanted me to play for the Patriots next year . " I honestly don ' t know what I want to do . I have to talk with my wife about whether we intend to live in New England the rest of our lives , or move on . Ron told me they would be talking to me about a new contract soon , so we will see what happens . " Veteran linebacker Steve Nelson will join Brock in the shoulder surgery department . Linebacker Don Blackmon , safety Roland James and offensive guard Bob Cryder all will have knee surgery soon . " We want them to get it done soon so they can start their rehab programs , " said Meyer . Meyer told the media he considers this past season a good first step . " I thought our players tried very hard this year and gave a good effort . I feel the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . " I think we learned a lot as a coaching staff and will work hard to do even a better job next year . We are all going to critique each other in the weeks ahead , and we also hope to have some input from our players . " Meyer said the players drafted last spring turned out well . " Ken Sims played just about the way I expected he would . I think there will be tremendous improvement in his play next season . " I was pleased with the way our young defense hung together . I hope we have begun to build something real solid there . Offensively , Steve Grogan will be our starting quarterback next year if things remain the same . I like to have a competitive situation in camp with all of our quarterbacks . " Not mentioned in the discussion were Sam Cunningham , Andy Johnson and Vagas Ferguson . When Meyer said he didn ' t know if management would extend contracts to all of the free agents , it was felt he was making reference to Cunningham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did make them free agents . " I ' m going to talk individually with as many players as I can before Thursday , " said Meyer . " I go to the East-West game and then on to the Senior Bowl to scout some players after that . But I intend to talk a lot during the winter to some of the veterans who live in the area . "
