There ' s something refreshing about the current crop of comedies - the women in them are smart and the men are foolish . They ' re refreshing because it wasn ' t long ago that the masculine mystique predominated . In fact , the whole decade of the ' 70s can be seen as a systematic disenfranchisement of the feminine mystique in Hollywood moviemaking , beginning with " Butch Cassidy " ( featuring Robert Redford ) and ending with a sort of coda , " Ordinary People " ( directed by Robert Redford ) in which - and this is apart from the quality of the film - the female protagonist ( Mary Tyler Moore ) functions as the heavy . Times are changing , however . Comedy is not only king , it ' s a queen . The hottest star in the firmament at the moment is Goldie Hawn , a comedienne ( " Private Benjamin , " " Seems Like Old Times " ) . Jill Clayburgh ( " It ' s My Turn , " " Starting Over " ) may be inheriting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the dearth of sophistication in contemporary scripts makes it a lot harder to be the new Hepburn than for Goldie Hawn to be the new screwball comedienne , a la Carole Lombard . Then there ' s " 9 to 5 , " a romp that disproves the canard that you can ' t be a feminist and have a sense of humor at the same time . " 9 to 5 " is less interesting as a showcase for Jane Fonda ' s comedic skill than as an indication of the very political Fonda ' s realization that comedy can be quite a useful vehiele for political point-making . Actually , the most dynamic aspect of " 9 to 5 " is Lily Tomlin ' s performance which redeems Tomlin ' s reputation as a comedienne following her unfortunate dramatic fling with John Travolta in " Moment by Moment . " The emergence of the new comediennes is enhanced by the simultaneous emergence of their foils , or straight men . The hottest foil in the movies today is Charles Grodin , Jill Clayburgh ' s determinedly laid-back roommate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawn ' s anxious , volatile second husband in " Seems Like Old Times . " With his anonymous dark good looks and his air of suppressed , manic desperation , Grodin functions as an emblematic contemporary masculine symbol . He always has a dazed look , the look of the man who knows he ' s been hit by something but can ' t figure out what . The foil ' s mantle fits Grodin more comfortably than it fits Chevy Chase , who teamed with Hawn in " Foul Play " before " Seems Like Old Times , " in which he plays her inept and incompetent first husband . Chase is a bit too clumsy . He works too hard at it . Grodin projects the aura of a man to whom incompetence comes naturally . Without that aura , he wouldn ' t be believable . Until recently , the role of women in movie comedies has been to function as decorative bystanders at the perpetration of a lot of risible comedy . " Airplane " and " Caddyshack , " two recent comedy hits , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vaudeville and burlesque , if not earlier , has been refined to the point of crudity on television . What ' s interesting about this kind of comedy is that it flourishes even as the new consciousness , if not self- consciousness , about women persists . It ' s as if women ' s liberation had never happened . Unfortunately , comedy must be relevant to retain the cutting edge it needs . Nothing is less funny than the tired claptrap that ' s passing for comedy on television these days . The mistake the movie industry is making is in adopting the very approach to comedy that is killing television , if not to say comedy . Interestingly , even as obvious a medium as television wasn ' t always as antithetical to humor as it is today . The medium has supplied us with many of the actors and actresses who are making us laugh today . Hawn and Tomlin are alumnae of " Laugh-In , " the TV revue which , with its frantic pace , rejuvenated the medium more than a decade ago . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Night Live , " Chevy Chase ' s launching pad , grew out of " Laugh-In . " Many of today ' s bread-and-butter , meat-and-potato comedies are elongated versions of " Laugh-In " or " Saturday Night Live . " In the more discerning comedies , however , the laughter comes from an appreciation of the resourcefulness of women and the ineptitude of their male associates . Clayburgh may wear unmanageable scarves in her films , but she ' s professionally adept . She ' s a genius math teacher in " It ' s My Turn . " Hawn is a lawyer in " Seems Like Old Times " and turns into a professional soldier in " Private Benjamin . " The three office workers in " 9 to 5 , " Fonda , Tomlin and Dolly Parton , may be mere minions , but they ' re much more capable than their boss ( Dabney Coleman ) . All of these women are making us laugh . But the laughter seems to have a nicer echo than it used to .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
