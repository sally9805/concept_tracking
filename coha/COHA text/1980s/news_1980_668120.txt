Some time next year , Boston architect John Sharratt , his wife and child will move into their new home . That in itself is nothing unusual , since hundreds of people move into new homes each year . But how many people next year will be moving into a bell and clock tower of a church ? How many can turn a church tower into a vertical split-level single-family home , and combine that with retail and office space ? Sharratt , who was instrumental in recycling the old granite 19th century Mercantile Wharf on the waterfront into a posh luxury apartment with an interior atrium and courtyard , is one of those who apparently can and will . Sharratt is now the owner of the historic 1807 Charles Street Meeting House Church , designed by Asher Benjamin at Charles and Mt . Vernon streets and now no longer needed for church use . The 41-year-old architect , who has won a number of national design awards , has gone through a grueling community review process with the Beacon Hill Civic Assn. and the Society for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preservation group some veto power over architectural changes . Sharratt also had to deal with the Beacon Hill Architectural Commission . But he says it was easier dealing with the commission than with the neighborhood group , which had three subcommittees , each of which could have sunk any rehabilitation plan presented . But having acted for years as an architectural advocate for many low- income commmunity groups dealing with city government , Sharratt has learned how to be patient and to compromise - he stuck with the review process where others might have given up . At any rate , he feels his new architectural adventure will be personally rewarding . " This property is one of the most important buildings on Beacon Hill next to the State House , " says Sharrett , who calls Asher Benjamin one of the country ' s more important architects . Benjamin , he says , preceded Charles Bulfinch and influenced him . What Sharratt has done on paper is divide the church into three uses : - Retail . The first floor area of the building area behind the bell and clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4200 square feet of retail space , or about four or five shops . This area is on the same level as Charles street , but if one enters the church from Mount Vernon street , he finds the area one level below - sort of the basement of the church . - Office space . The main hall of the church , where parishioners worshiped , will have more than 10,000 square feet of office space . Sharratt ' s architectural practice will be located here , as well as his residence . - Residence . This is the clock and bell tower portion , where Sharratt has designed a four-level townhouse with a total space of about 3000 square feet , a good-sized dwelling . The tower portion measures about 17 feet by 32 feet . Recently , Sidney Kummins Inc. of Brookline , the contractor , began translating the designs on paper into physical reality . Sharratt ' s house will have a small residential elevator and a new stairway in the tower winding up to the various split-level areas . There would be a downstairs workshop for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area . Above that are levels for the master bedroom and master bath , the kitchen and dining room , a study and then a living room at the top part of the house below the belfry . And since the tower portion of the church protrudes along Mt . Vernon street , the residents will have a view of the Charles River running at the foot of Mt . Vernon , with no obstructions . " We will be exploring the possibility of continuing to have the clock function since it has become a landmark for many people . We also will explore the possibility of continuing to have the bell ring - but if we find it interferes with our living arrangements , obviously we will not have it ring , " said Sharratt . On the River street side of the tower , the Sharratt family will have a 17 foot by 20 foot " lawn , " enclosed by a four-foot-high wrought-iron fence , one concession he got from the community . The church hall will be turned into two floors of office space - actually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharratt . But the archedwindows running from the floor to the barrelled-vault ceilings will remain . A second set of double glazed windows will be installed behind these old set ofwindows . The old ceiling also will remain , exposed on the top floor , and the church columns will remain intact . The large entrance doors to the main worship hall from Mt . Vernon street will be sealed and a new lobby area built at the Mt . Vernon street entrance for the office portion . Existing winding stairways on each sidse of theentrance will be removed and a new staircase built . An office elevator will be installed to the right of the new lobby area . Sharratt said that much of the interior had no historic value since it was built in later years within the brick interior of the original design . The retail area presented some problems since the community and the preservation group would now allow Sharratt to cut through the facade andwindows . Sharratt ' s solution is to open the middle doors during the retail hours . Within the church , parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedestrian " street " with the shops along it . He plans to have the shops in by Christmas and the offices ready for occupancy by the first of the year . His house and office will be the last to be completed . Before purchasing the Beacon Hill property , Sharratt bought a surplus church on Massachusetts avenue in the Back Bay where he planned a similar venture . However , a fire just about destroyed the vacant property and he abandoned that project . Why churches ? " My prime goal really is to find a place where I can live and work at the same time . This is very important to me . I don ' t want to commute . Sometimes I can wake up in the middle of the night with an idea and want to record it . I can go right into my office and do just that . " And churches are interesting and beautiful arachitecturally and inexpensive to purchase ( It cost him $225,000 ) since most people don ' t know what to do with them . Only a limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a small one for Sharratt , who has designed the 750- unit Mission Park apartment complex in the Mission Hill area of Roxbury and the still-growing Villas Victorias development of more than 600 housing units in the South End .
