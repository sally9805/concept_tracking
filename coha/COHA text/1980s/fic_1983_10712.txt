A P P R O A C Hviolet asters . As the ground got steeper , I kept close to Ryan 's heels , where the scent of snowy , crushed bushes was almost overpowering . Just as the sun came up over the mountain we reached the lower snowfield . We knew nothing about route finding and very little about snowfields . Orion just picked out what seemed like the easiest way to get to the summit and I  --  tied into our rope a hundred feet behind him  --  just followed in his footsteps . The snow got softer and softer and in its viselike grip one of my boots , too big , kept coming off and sitting , empty , in its nest , and I would call " Ryan " while I kept on walking bootless in the wake of the moving rope , until he heard me and stopped and came back and put on my boot , saying , " Temis , try and keep it on ; we 'll never get up at this rate , " very patiently and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rope was stretched between us once again . By midafternoon , when we still had n't reached the top and when every deceptive crest revealed another one beyond it , I was in a daze of hunger , thirst and sun , and sometimes was almost in tears , but by then Orion had tied my boot on with a length of twine and he kept saying from in front , " A little farther , Temis , " or " Artemis , come on . " We made the summit about four in the afternoon . My heart was beating very fast and my wrists were chapped from sweating into my mittens . When I showed them to Orion , he rubbed them with some snow , then set me down on a lump of rock and said : " Is it worth it ? Are you glad ? " A sheep was bleating somewhere . Below us , an eagle wheeled and circled , and on the ridge opposite ours the snowfield , high in its hanging cornice , assumed , as I watched it , strange forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hungry lion . I felt as if I had no clothes on , or as if I were an animal myself . I nodded . It was worth it . The world was shining below . And off in the distance , in a spot where I had n't once looked before , there was a clearing on a far , far ridge , and where the trees parted like fingers to reveal the sky behind them , a mountain grew , ethereal , transitory , vulnerable toAPPROACH 21the touch of a finger . I started to cry when I saw it . I felt as if someone had hit me in the chest right above the heart , knocking the wind from my lungs and most of myself from my body ; as if I had been lifted out of myself and was floating freely , somewhere in the air above my head , untethered , waiting to be pulled back down . There was a luminosity about the world , a transparent , diaphanous clarity , white snow and great space and forms below that space that lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those forms , was wide , with space not just below my feet but more , beyond the farthest reaches of my eyes , its luminosity something I was to see again and again , each time I climbed  --  when , after deep effort , there is a relaxation of the body and the spirit so complete that even the face relaxes , the eyes widen and the fingers dangle , used like all the notes of an instrument in a clarion explosion after which great silence seems to hide great laughter , just like the act of love . " We 'll get there , " said Ryan , not moving . " Do n't worry , Temis , it 's ours . " But what he knew and I knew , even then , was that we already were there , that there is no there more here than that overwhelming physical effort which throws you into space itself . And like a duck emerging from its egg , which fixes its heart on the first set of moving feet it sees , I bonded then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boots ahead of me in the snow , and always after that my love for him and for the mountains were just two halves of one great love , the palm and knuckles of all I longed to hold . The one love was , I already sensed , forbidden ; the other , so great was the sorrow it brought me , for all I know may be forbidden too . We got back to camp in the darkness . " Hey , Phillips . Good climb , hey ? " was all my brother said . So from that day on we called ourselves Phillips and Phillips , and thought of ourselves as that as well . Not that we did n't like our first names , odd as they were ; we loved them . But it was like being in disguise to be Phillips and Phillips  --  no one would know22 A P P R O A C Hus for who we were . When we started to do first ascents together , we were listed as Phillips and Phillips in all the guidebooks and it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when Nicholas joined us , or we joined him , we were Phillips , Phillips and Rhodes . And had it not been for my brother , I never could have stayed with Nicholas . Ryan certainly saw from the first what I did not , that I only hated Nicholas as long as I could n't have him ; and when I could , I felt as if I was standing in the center of a clearing in the middle of a deep pine forest , with sunlight streaming onto the needles and drenching me in warmth . Half the time we were together we were struggling for power , but the other half , that warmth held me like a cushion or a rug : I was mainlining Nicholas , plugged in to him , and we drained each other and filled each other with desire . Desire was what we lived on anyway . Desire was why we climbed . In the end , it was why I went to Nepal , where I thought I could leave it behind . TreeNaomi and I waited three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced . Although this was two hours longer than we should have waited , the guards were totally unresponsive to our pleas for information and spoke English only disdainfully , " as if , " Naomi told me , " it was something nasty they 'd tasted . " So catatonicand lethargic did I feel that I simply put myself in Naomi 's hands for all this time , following where she led . She explored the tiny bookstore at the end of the room , discovering with great delight several books on Tantric sex , and she bought a bottle of Kama Sutra oil , specially packaged for tourists . When I discovered that I had left my water bottle on the plane , hot liquid , frozen ice cubes and all , she urged me to stay calm  --  as if I could have been anything else  --  and tried out her iodine pellets . From time to time she went over to speak to the guards , who wore Sam Browne belts and faded purple-blue cotton uniforms with three gold braids on their sleeves . They seemed straight out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All this inspired in Naomi an urge to discuss the British Empire ; in me , it inspired nothing but dread . Dread that we would never leave Bombay . Dread that we were stuck with death for life . Finally , we joined the sticky line to pass through security clearanceinto the main waiting lounge . The guards stood behind a wooden table and allowed us to place our carry-on luggage in front24 A P P R O A C Hof them like offerings . With a flick of his palm , my guard indicated that I was now permitted to open my rucksack , and he poked through it condescendingly before , with another flick , he allowed me to close it . In a small curtained alcove , a woman in a sari frisked me slowly and carefully , her hands patting my body uninterestedly , but with the attention to detail that a prostitute might give a customer , and then  --  after asking me for a cigarette  --  she too flicked her hand , disgustedly , and let me go . But the overriding lethargy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my passport on the desk . One guard , who had a little more gold braid than the rest of them , told me courteously that he would have to detain me for a moment . I was n't surprised  --  by that time I had no real hope of ever leaving Bombay and nothing could have surprised me , nothing  --  so I sat carefully on the edge of a chair while two guards , who were whisked in from the wings for the big occasion , started to question me . My catatonia started to change to fury , and I 'm sure I would have spent the night in an Indian jail if not for Naomi , who was just behind me , and came up to join me then . Though the guards tried to wave her away when she approached , she smiled brightly as if she knew that could not be what they meant , and proceeded to demonstrate some of the Hindustani she had acquired a bit of on the way to the Taj Mahal . Clearly , she was asking what was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend from America , the woman in charge of outfitting and supplying a large expedition , as well as a famous and respected climber , was being so rudely detained in the middle of the night . After a minute or two of studying my passport again and asking me questions about my birthplace for the sake of saving face , they let me go , smiling and nodding at Naomi . Anyone who wonders at the surprising successesshe corners in mountains should take a look at her techniquewith men . So she got me out of Bombay . Delhi was n't much better , though . It was cooler , less humid at least , which was nice , and the fans in the transit lounge seemed to be working more effectively . But I wanted to check into theAPPROACH 25progress of the expedition gear , which was scheduled to be transferred to a Royal Nepal Airlines freight plane , and at three o'clock in the morning there were no officials in the Delhi transit lounge except for a morose-looking baggage handler who kept sticking out his hand , furtively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a dollar bill in it , he would n't let me through to the main terminal , where there might have been someone I could talk with . But Naomi , with an act that I thought bordered on genius , went up to him with her hand between her breasts , and after suggestivelyplucking at the lace of her bodice , got us both neatly through the gate . We could n't find the gear , but just as our baggage handler was starting to get tough , an announcer trumpetedout the information that our flight to Nepal was boarding . The first light of dawn was in the sky , the horizon red with haze and sunshiny . At last , after a detour through the first circle of hell , we were on our way to the mountain . Margaret and Laurie were waiting for us at the airport in Katmandu , and by a miracle , our gear was waiting with them . It was piled in huge , generous heaps along the walls , on the countertops , everywhere I looked , and a smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil , they were friendly , joyous , welcoming . A cool breeze blew across the landing strip and only one small plane stood in the center of it , insouciant and bold . There was an air of delighted conspiracy in the airport terminal , as if it were the vestibule to an enchanted place , a place which luckily very few people had been able to find . The mood that morning was very much the same mood I found again when we got to Manang , where the high-hill Buddhists , in contrast to the lower-living Hindus , were gay and bawdy and raucous , singing out the salutation " Namaste " long before they got close to you on the trail , prolonging the word with the unfettered delight of a child licking an all-day sucker . Basically , I 'd been awake for forty-one hours when we got there . I had all the shipping invoices carefully lined up in my clipboard and the contents of each box written out in triplicate , 26 A P P R O A C Hbut I was feeling more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuck me into a feather bed than like negotiating my way through customs . I looked around for Naomi , but she had disappeared to greet an old Sherpa friend of hers , and was plasteredto him in an embrace which could not have been easily broken . And Margaret , a Scottish doctor who was famous for always getting someone to the summit of every climb she 'd led , stood at attention in the middle of the floor , her shoulders straight , her face very brown and wrinkled , her hair cropped short to her head , then strode forward with her hand outstretched , so there was nothing to do but take it . " Miss Phillips , " she said , taking my hand firmly in her own  --  I could even feel the calluses on her palm , one below each finger . " Margaret McKelvey . So glad you could make it "  --  as if I had arrived for tea on notice that was , perhaps , just a little bit short for polite society . I was in awe of her reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How do you do ? " I said , all my childhood training coming back to me , visions of tweed coats with little fur collars and matching round fur caps ( the proper outfit for going to town in Lander , Wyoming , in the fifties , according , at least , to my mother , who usually wore jeans ) coming to my aid like a special lip stiffener . " I 've been looking forward to it . " Not too gushy , not too brusque . We showered Nepal with papers . Then she drove us to her house outside Katmandu , where , though I went to bed , I could rest only in fits and starts , so blown away was I by Nepal : the mountains and the people within them . Perhaps it was lack of sleep that made the next few days so strange . The team arrived slowly . Robin Harrington , a computer programmer from Denver , arrived feeling pretty outclassed and talking about all the times she 'd soloed the Flatirons , but she soon proved an accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tall and thin , with thick blond hair that she wore in a single braid at the neck , she would shimmer around our temporary house playing the flute and talking about her children with a kind of clinical pride . Dervla was delivered to Nepal by her coal-black husband , Nati , an anthropologist whom she had met while she was on field study in East Africa , and she quickly made it clear that her real interest was not in climbing at all , but in the character of the Nepalese people . We got a telegram from Tina saying that she would be late , and that , or something else , seemed to sour Naomi 's temper rather markedly ; although she did n't mind working , she did n't like doing more than her share , and she let everyone know it . Laurie was at least nominally my friend , since we had climbefl together in the Canadian Rockies , but in Nepal she seemed more homely and reserved than ever and her eyes  --  which appear to be made for looking at things from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and out the other side . And Margaret was upset because not only Tina , but Sibyl and Taffy , were also going to be late . Everyone , in fact , was suffering from some kind of vertigo , and I was no exception . Except for Naomi , all the other climbers seemed either married or professionals , and I felt both jealous and awkward , and startlingly insecure . At first , I spent a lot of time at the windows . In the distance I could just catch sight of terraces of dried dun earth and golden wheat , with piles of bright-orange brick around them . One morning in the street below my room a tiny barefoot old woman carried a battered tin teapot , its surface as dim as light through thick plastic ; bent forward as if she carried great weight , she nestled it in her arms as they linked behind her back . A younger woman , scrawny and tall , carried a baby on her back in just the same way , her hands linked under its buttocks . Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragged himself along the street . His two back legs were shriveled , useless , but his two front legs still strong , and though his stomach was covered with mud and dung , his expression was quite determined , even hopeful , as if he knew28 A P P R O A C Hwhere he was going . As if he had a destination in mind . And I was in this totally spaced-out state of amazement , to find that there really were places in the world where people did n't have infinite desire and did n't go the way of India either , embracing death like a lover . I tried meditating , but I felt like a fool with so many hard-assed climbers looking on . So I finally started to move . The whole time we were working , before the last three climbers arrived , every chance I got I went off to the bazaar or walked in the hills outside the city , with the sense that there was something there I had to find  --  a doorstop , a temple , a clue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delirious place I could n't just sit by and let its sensations bombard me ; I had an active responsibility to try and sort things out , to try and find my own path to the mountain that was contained , surrounded by this land . And this was hard , because I could n't remember now why I had come . Getting there , being there , it was not that I had no past . The past was with me as I walked , sweat dripping from the tip of my nose , my black cotton umbrella hiding me from the sun and the rain . But the past , though it was with me , continually broke up beneath the rays of the sun , a diamond fragmented by a laser , and the chips fell about me like hailstones off my umbrella , cascading to the ground . I tried to gather them in again  --  to remember Jackson Hole and Nicholas and Ryan , consummations that I understood  --  but I could not . All I could do was look and smell and touch , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neuron paths of my own brain . All I remember of those days is images  --  impressions , disjointedand intense , in color as vivid as a Disney movie and with something of the same sense of unreality , the sense that what I saw was only cardboard thick and that just out of sight in the streets beyond were cameramen wheeling their machines along on trolleys , scriptmen carefully studying pages clipped together at the corners , crews of workmen spreading mounds of dung and refuse , carrying bundles of vegetables in carts , aging the awningsAPPROACH 29over the bicycle rickshas . One woman sat behind two wilted bundles of lettuce spread thoughtfully on a plastic cloth ; she stared down at them , puzzled , as if trying to read in them the secrets of life itself . In the darkness of a storefront , a minuscule , low-roofed cubbyhole in the wall , a dwarfish woman sat calmly , one bare leg thrust right into an enormous pile of crabbed potatoes . A tiny child held an even tinier one in her arms , carefullyrooting around in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked through this stunned . Not unhappy ; not passive ; but as bright and hopeful and acltive as anyone can be who has been hit in the head with a baseball bat and gotten to her feet minutes later , the unwitting victim of a serious concussion . I had thought that I was coming here to climb a mountain . I had n't thought that I would first have to make my way through an obstacle course , a maze of stimulation as unsought as mescaline in my punch , as complicated as the bazaar which was its objective correlative . It was humanity itself that bewildered me . I thought I had , through eight long years with Nicholas , learned to know what ruled it . But here , in the Katmandu valley , although I saw just people  --  two eyes , two arms , usually two legs  --  I could n't see their lusts , could n't understand their motivations , could n't imagine the direction of their desires . Yet they seemed to live such public lives  --  no hiding behind picket fences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwear on bushes to dry , pissing and shitting in the streets , tossing dead rats out their windows . What made it a Disney production was not the colors , not the tinny , keening music , not the incense or the dung , but the impression this somehow all added up to that the people here were simple , happy , that they were n't ruled by the lust to have more , know more , be more  --  that they lived thoughtlessly . Nothing could mar this impressionfor me . I remember one little child trying to sell me some stamps . He followed me for blocks , holding up his booklets , brandishinghis wares . He was dirty , smelly , ragged  --  an unnecessary child who nevertheless seemed to me amazing , unique , an incar-30 A P P R O A C Hnate human soul who lived in a kind of perpetual present and this even as he followed me , wheedling , a budding businessman , a survivor-in-training at the age of eight or so . At last I stopped and told him I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " When , then ? " " Maybe tomorrow . " " Today is tomorrow , " he replied without pausing . " Never , then . " " Oh , never ! " He shrugged and went away . So perhaps it is n't lack of desire . Perhaps they simply use desire differently than we ; they let it work for them . On the approach march , at lunch or dinner , when the children gathered around our camp , I used to take off my alarm watch and dangle it from the strap , setting it to go off after a moment with a thin burring noise . The kids , who would actually have been quite contented just to watch the hands go round , would listen to the burring , quite still until it stopped . When Tina wrote in her notebook , they watched the pen on the paper , crowding close , not touching the notebook , not touching the pen , but soaking up the smooth curves of the ink as they revealed themselves , until I wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was one girl , in red trousers and a red blouse , who stood longer than all the rest , never coming close . Her milk pail dangled as if it were a painted pot . Only her eyes moved . If only Nicholas could have seen her . We might have learned a lot from the people of Nepal . YourI 'd been asked on the expedition on Laurie 's recommendation , since Margaret knew Laurie well . Of course , she had heard of me through other people too  --  Phillips , Phillips and Rhodes : it sounds like a law firm , does n't it ?  --  but I think she was a little uncertain about whether I was capable of climbing with other women . I was a little uncertain myself , even when I first was invited , since I had n't had that much to do with women in my life and had often thought that I understood them even less than I did men . The only team I 'd climbed with , after all , was the team of my husband and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more like a freak than the norm . So maybe I 'd been afraid to let myself understand , afraid that on close examination women would turn out to be everything men have sometimes claimed them to be  --  devious , perhaps , or manipulative , cowardly or undisciplined  --  andthat would be a bad piece of news to acquire . Obviously , it would mean that my own conception of myself was nothing but a chimera . Or perhaps there was the even worse fear that men 's judgments would turn out to be nonsense and that actually women were just men in disguise . Even worse because , whatever the difficulties of being a woman in a man 's world , I certainly did n't want to be a man . But actually , considering my one past experience with a women 's expedition , it 's amazing I agreed to go to Nepal at all. 32 A P P R O A C HIn the summer of 1974 , the Russians put on a mountaineering extravaganza , and Nicholas and Ryan and I were part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some spectacular first ascents and except for the fact that our radios did n't make it through customs and the fact that when we arrived at base camp there were fifty-nine weird-looking Austrians already in residence there , a motley crew who turned out to be a kind of tour group of hill walkers , possessed of potbellies , lederhosen and sprightly wool caps , things started off well enough . But they ended very badly , and it was mostly because of the Soviet women who froze on Lenin Peak . The Russian women were uniformly gorgeous . Healthy and young , with a remarkable solidarity , they went everywhere in a group and burst out of base camp for training climbs across the river as if they were bursting out of a starting gate . They did n't mix with the other teams , but they did n't seem to need to , and an air not just of eagerness but of mission exuded from them like a deadly gas . As if the fate of the German Eiger climbers in the thirties had not proved that climbing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to get killed . And in the case of the Soviet women , they seemed intent on climbing not just for Mother Russia but for the honor of all women everywhere . This women 's team was scheduled to traverse Lenin Peak . The fact that it was Lenin Peak was hardly surprising , as the main concern of the Russian organizers of the convocation seemed to be to get as many climbers as possible to the top of that one mountain , where they could  --  presumably  --  rub the great man 's electroplated bust and affirm the imperative of history . But the traverse that the women were scheduled to do is very demanding ; you have to carry full packs up from the east on the Lipkin ridge to the summit and then down the Razdelny on the west . And it could n't have helped them much to realize that they were the focus of a big internecine squabble in Russia about the wisdom of letting women do anything at all without male leadership . A couple of times I saw them doing calisthen-APPROACH 33ics outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a summer that was ! No one could possibly have predictedthe series of catastrophes that dogged the Russian mountains that July . Earthquakes kept shaking the slopes we sat on . There seemed to be nothing that did n't avalanche , cornices toppledlike leaves , and it actually poured rain for days on end at twenty thousand feet and higher . With conditions like that , it 's amazing that anyone survived . But despite the wrath of the gods , some good climbs got carried out . A strong French team took Peak Sixteen , and Nicholas and Ryan and I managed to climb Peak Twenty-four . We were already back in base camp when the Russian women set out on their traverse . They carried enormous and oddly balanced packs , loaded , as rumor had it , with some of the worst-designed equipment the climbing world had yet produced , all of it Russian made . I guess it was four days later that the major storm warnings went out . The unending stream of rain and snow had already turned base camp into a sea of mud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a storm could be more major than the one we found around us . But climbers were peeling off Lenin Peak in a wet and dismal procession and it seemed hardly necessary to warn anyone in his right mind that conditions in the mountains were anything but good . There were over forty people at twenty thousand feet and higher , and the Soviet Meteorological Survey was predicting winds of hurricane force . Well , the women went for the summit . No one knows why they did so , as they themselves never said , but they probably had some very good reasons that they passed back and forth like crackers , satisfying , though inadequately , the hunger of their hopes . Whateverthe logic they used to support this , it was a crazy thing to do . They camped just below the summit and by morning the first of their lousy tents had blown apart . The wind slab was too tough for snow caves and the youngest woman was hypothermic . As each woman fell sick , the others felt compelled to stay with her until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the34 A P P R O A C Hexcruciating ordeal of staying with them too , since they remained in radio contact throughout the next five days while the storm raged on and one by one they died . They had no food . They had no water . And finally , they had no tents , no life . If they had n't been warned of a major storm approaching ; if they had n't reported in with such pitiful regularity ; if they had n't been so obviously obsessed with their honor . . . anything would have made it better than it was . But it was a nightmare , a fullblownnightmare , and Nicholas , somehow , made it into his own . He wanted so much to save them , as did we all ; he wanted to stage a rescue in that storm . But it was impossible , more than impossible , crazy , and half of our energy went into calming him down . He sat in the radio tent each night , listening to their transmissions , withdrawn into a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he wandered around like a ghost . One of their last transmissions was an apology for dying , and if there was one thing I was glad about in our position on the mountain , those eight days I lived through with Tina in that tent , it was the fact that our radios had fallen in the river with Changpa when he drowned , and if we had died on the mountain it would have been ours alone to know about . And though , on the eighth day , Naomi climbed the wall , and though , on the ninth day , somehow she got us down , I do n't think we 'd have lasted to see that time if we 'd been in touch with the world down below . The women asked when they would smell the flowers , and who would care for their children when they were gone . Later , when the storm stopped , we went to recover their bodies . They lay like felled trees upon the snow , and Nicholas , when he saw them , started to cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help them , though he held them tenderly , dead . Did I say I would n't like to find myself a man ? Did I say that distance brings perspective ? Well , both , it seems , are nonsense , since I 've wanted to be a man since I was born , and since I still see those women 's bodies in my dreams . My dreams , in any case , are long these days . I dreamed last night that I was back on theAPPROACH 35mountain with Tina . The camp looked as if a hurricane had hit it , and the storm was driving snow in through the back seams of the tent . But the air was sweet , and Tina 's arms were warm , and both of us were whole . Before Tina arrived in Nepal  --  God , it seemed an endless time in the city . She did n't get there until the last minute because she was finishing up editing a film before she came and going over the proofs of her latest book . Her father runs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those tiny artsy presses that publish thin books with woodcuts on their covers , woodcuts of women with sharp features , standing over woodstoves in long aprons , holding bread pans , looking like futuristic impressions of themselves  --  andhe published her first book , Freelance Adventuring , all about how to do what you want to do in the adventure business and get paid for it . She arrived laden with cameras and lenses and notebooks , her pencils sharpened , and started commenting about the madness of a country where they have hand blow dryers in the bathrooms even though the electricity is off half the time , and taking pictures of the team  --  The Team Packing Boxes , The Team Discussing Strategy , The Team Sitting on Their Asses  --  half of the pictures staged , all of them , really , except the sitting on our asses ones . But though normally all this would have driven me quite mad , Tina made it seem all right  --  more than all right , funny  --  because although her pencils were sharpened she seemed to keep dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd never read them , and she staggered through doorways and bumped into lintels , then laughed like a baboon . She had a faded black-and-white snapshot of a bull moose pulling a plow , which she extracted from her pocket and thrust at people at odd moments , explaining that she 'd raised it from calfhood and that its name was Ben . I had first met Tina in Santa Fe , more than five years before . She was living with another woman at the time , as a kind of36 A P P R O A C Hpermanent houseguest , but she spent a lot of time with Ryan , doing climbs in the Sangre de Cristos . Ryan had put an ad in the local paper : " Climbing Partner Wanted , I Can Lead 5.11 , " and Tina had answered it by phone with a long-winded account of her experience on rock  --  which at the time did n't amount to much  --  and more important , an endless and complicated tale about the fact that she did n't have a car just now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom she was living had gotten involved in some litigation over the shape of the roof of her house . The roof was not , like most roofs in Santa Fe , flat , but was more the shape of a Quonset hut , half of a barrel , high and vaulted and with tiny skylights sprinkled across it like glitter . The neighbor who was suing Tina 's housemate , Elanor , for havingsuch a roof was not just litigious but actually quite a rat fink ( Tina 's term ) , and would come over to the house in the middle of the night and make loud noises on the lawn with an ancient noisemaker , a wooden contraption of paddles and brass which had , in the nineteenth century , been used to summon police . But actually , Tina told Ryan on the phone , she thought the reason he was so nasty was not because of the roof at all , but because he suspected that Elanor and Tina were lesbians  --  which you would think in a place like Santa Fe would go quite unnoticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the end of which explanation , Tina got back to the car she did n't possess , and said that she wanted to get out of town more , and would be happy to climb with Orion . He had graduated that spring and had gotten a job as a mining engineer , and when I went to see him that winter , I was half intending to stay . But Tina was already quite a fixture . She came over to dinner the first night I was there . She arrived wearing pink and black  --  black pants , black shirt and short pink jacket  --  and around her neck a small silver ice ax and an equally small silver climbing shoe . Not only was she six feet two , with legs like a horse and shoulders to match the rest of her , but she had the shortest blond hair , harshly whitened by the sun , that I had ever seen on a woman , and bangs which fell across her foreheadAPPROACH 37like a curtain . She seemed to explode into the house , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she threw her arms around Ryan and hugged him till he gasped . Then she shook my hand and shook her earrings also , four-inch-long hawk feathers which were hanging beside three-inch-long beaded strings and which later on in the evening got mixed up with the spaghetti sauce and had to be thrown away . At dinner , Tina talked . She was full of the latest excitement , which was that Elanor , who was in the midst of countersuing her neighbor for being a malicious nuisance , and who was also at the crucial stage of her own barrel-roof defense , had just that day discovered that her neighbor had nonconforming windows ! If nothing else , he would certainly be reprimanded by the Historical Styles Committee and the Planning Commission of the town . Orion kept trying to get Tina to pipe down , but Tina was irrepressibleand finally he just leaned back in his chair and gave in . Usually , he was as crazy as she was , though , and even that night at one point he smeared spaghetti sauce on his cheeks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he were a chipmunk . I was n't at all convinced that Tina was really straight ; she kept flirting with me , as she flirted with Ryan and seemingly with her whole world . She flirted with the silver on the table , the flowers in the vase , she flirted with the wine and the spaghetti and the hot garlicky bread . Nibbling this , devouring that , she dominated the conversation just exactly as long as it would bear it , then effortlessly shifted over to questions , staring with her gray-blue eyes . Irresistibly puppyish , she carried all before her , and I could see that Ryan was more than half in love . I had n't seen Tina since that visit and had n't thought I 'd be glad to . She and Ryan had broken up not long afterward , and she had n't come to Ryan 's funeral but had sent me a long and disjointedletter explaining that she hated funerals , that she had seen enough dead bodies in the mountains and that she wanted to remember Ryan as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! On belay ! " Furthermore , she wrote , she would be seeing me in Nepal ; 38 APPROACHat least , she hoped so , if I did n't change my mind and decide not to come . She thought that would be a bad idea , since you had to pick up and get on with your life . But when she arrived , I was truly glad to see her . Though I was , of course , still jealous then of her relationship with Ryan , it was clear enough that she did n't know it , so why should I make a big fuss ? She felt , in fact , that they 'd had only a friendship , and in that she was probably right . Because when we were grown , I think Ryan felt about me much the same way that I felt about Nicholas when first I got to know him . He was not as passionate as I , as Nicholas , if by passionate you mean reckless ; he never cared to risk the things he loved the best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those intervals of stark intensity which were to Nicholas and me the stuff of life . When he and I were together , though , just the two of us , he came closer to being gripped by longing than most people would have thought wise , and when we were apart his life was governed still by that and by his knowledge  --  which neither of us talked about  --  that in another world , another time , we might have been sufficient to each other . Well , Tina and I , if nothing else , could at least share a common remembrance . And with her arrival in Nepal , I felt suddenly that yes , I could remember my past , could gather in all those pieces of the diamond and then put them back together again , that there was a real world , and it was the world of the camera itself , the seeing eye rather than the scene the eye sees . All those beautiful sights that had enthralled me  --  the purple-flowering ginkgo trees , the piles of bright-orange brick , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either real or not real , but it did n't matter anyway , because it was what you did with them that counted , how you used them to interpret your own past and future . So in that mood , the mood , I suppose , of a professional tourist , I made the mistake of going on a tour of the Katmandu valley the day before we left for the mountain . I 'd been feeling a little sick , as if I were on the edge of contracting the Katmandu Krud , butAPPROACH 39instead of staying in bed like a sensible woman , I took some aspirin , do n't ask me why , and climbed into the tiny tour bus with the rest of the team . We went to temples and shortens and more temples and spun prayer wheels and listened to our tour guide  --  Banni , a dark Nepalese , impeccably dressed in white linen trousers and a fine-combed cotton shirt  --  tell seemingly endless stories about the way a particulartemple came to be built , which usually involved a father sacrificing his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without knowing who he was , only that he was the single man in the kingdom virtuous enough so that his death would release the rains and free the land from drought . I 'm not saying they were n't interesting stories : the king who set a brass bird on top of his stone statue and said as he went off to war that as long as the bird was there he was alive and if he were killed it would fly away in the wars  --  no , no , if he was killed in the wars it would fly away . I was a little giddy with suppressed hysterics by the time we got to a temple with ten enormous steps leading up to it and on each step a pair of animals , and it turned out that each consecutive set of animals had three times the strength of the set before and instead of just indicating this fact and letting us figure out the arithmetic , our guide took us up step by excruciating step , from the monkeys to the cows to the lions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the griffins , which had , not surprisingly , three times the strength of the elephants . Then Naomi , delightfullymalicious , asked Banni to repeat the last three animals ' herculean statistics . Well , that would have been quite enough . But there was one final temple to do , and our guide had saved it for last because it was by far the most important and sat on a river that had the same significance for the Nepalese that the Ganges has for the Indians . We bumped through a hundred back streets to get there , so that my stomach , which had been only potentially queasy when we started , was definitely queasy when we stopped . When we stepped off the bus we nearly landed in a pile of sacred cow dung and then40 A P P R O A C Halmost ran into the sacred cow , not a cow at all but a great black bull with horns painted blue , that sat in the middle of the road regarding us with superb self-possession . With my stomach feeling the way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I did n't exactly approach the Rammadir temple with an open mind . There was a series of concrete platforms spaced along the edge of the river , at intervals of perhaps fifty feet . On the one that was nearest to us when we arrived , a great fire of logs was burning and on top of the logs a corpse . A man stood by the ghat , desultorily poking at the fire with a pole . It was n't so much the corpse , or the smell , that disturbed me . It was the river which was the focus of the scene . It was n't a river at all , it was a sluggish sea of brown mud , with stagnant pools of water filled with the debris of burning  --  half-charred logs and scraps of clothing , bits of bone and piles of ashes , none of them traveling anywhere , simply rotting in a sea of putrefaction . Just below the ghat where the corpse was burning , three women in aqua and red saris were doing their washing , and three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the puddles . One man crouched on his haunches , washing out a brass teakettle , and one very old man was taking a spiritual bath . He was white and bony and his legs looked like two sticks . He had to be helped into and out of the water . That anyone could go near that river , much less bathe in it , play in it , wash in it  --  I simply could n't believe it . I focused my eyes on the ground and kept them there while Banni , in a bright professional tone , told us that the huts we saw were dying huts . " To the truly religious , " he said , " it is best of all to come here to die . A special privilege . Everyone wants to die here . Not all do so , of course . If they think they are dying they may come and then not die . Some stay for a day , some for three days , some for months , three months or four . Maybe at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . That is too bad . But they can not know , of course . And if they do die here , their souls are especially blessed , it is a great blessing . I think there is someone dying now . " APPROACH 41We moved on up the hill . On the bottom set of steps sat a leper , a young girl of fourteen or fifteen , dressed in a sari , her hand outstretched so that it almost touched my leg . She had only half a nose and the skin on her face was horribly disfigured with red and white blotches . A Hindu holy man , his face decorated with vivid colored paste , his hair drawn up into a topknot , crouched on his heels and keened , an endless , mournful , shrill whining , like the hum of mosquitoes at night . A monkey , excrement hanging from its bare pink ass , ran by us , then leaped onto a woman 's chest and grabbed a bag of food from her jhola before he ran away . Western hippies , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a sudden furious barking erupted on the hillside below and a mass of ten or twenty moiling dogs rushed into view , seemingly hysterical with anger , Banni looked down at them benevolently and said , " Ahh . Mad dog . " Even Naomi was taken aback . In an effort , perhaps , to avoid a response , she went over to one of the dying huts and peered through the door . Her voice was fairly subdued , for Naomi , when she said , " My God . There 's a corpse in here . " I did n't look . If I had had the power  --  truly , awful as it sounds  --  if I had had the power I would have gotten the biggest bulldozeryou 've ever seen and razed that place , leveled it as flat as a football field , the river and the corpses and the temple monkeys , the lepers and the shit and the dogs . I would have pushed it all into nothingness and maybe even set up a concession stand promotingballoons and pure air and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at least in letting things be . But I did not . I wanted things to be nice , I wanted the earth unsullied , and above all I wanted death to be sudden and putrefaction sweet . I wanted no body bags , no sphincter muscles and no pain . Just roses and an odor of sanctity . Some Buddhist , eh ? Some Buddhist . Or if not roses , even better , a moment in a blue crevasse , a sudden fall through windy space , a perfect , gentle instant in the snow , when what has been becomes what is not and the sun , golden yellow , shines down to waft you upward to the sky . I wanted to42 A P P R O A C Hcheck out in the mountains and nowhere else , my feet on rock , my hands reaching for the silver clouds above . We all wanted that , I guess . Maybe that 's part of why we were there . But for me , perhaps it was something more . That I did n't die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the men I loved . After the avalanche , in the months that followed it like boulders , sluggish in the wake of a glacier that has passed on , I wanted nothing myself but to die . Not because I wanted to die , not really . Oh , God , how I wanted to live ! But that they could die like that , so suddenly : it ripped the bottom out of my world . I missed them desperately and was full of guilt and longing ; but it was n't that , you know . It was that if they could die I could die and if I was going to die anyway I wanted to do it and get it over and have that much less to fear . When the first spring thaw came and the sagebrush poked up through the snow and smelled as sweet as birthdays , as weddings , I did n't want to smell it , I did n't want to know . The world was full of celebrations , but the more I loved it , the more I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose even one thing more  --  the leaf of a sagebrush , a crunch in the snow. divePeople always thought it was romantic , a team of a woman and two men . Romance is not what I would call it , when Nicholas was at his worst . And they always thought , of course , that Nicholas and I were the Phillips and Phillips and Ryan was the Rhodes . It used to annoy Nicholas unspeakably . Not that I never took his name , but that people could n't keep his straight . He was Nicholas Rhodes the mountaineer . There was only one of him . But if that sounds arrogant , it should n't . Nicholas  --  he was an idealist , under all his macho . To succeed was n't what he wanted . He wanted to live in a world where failure was impossible . And the mountains  --  the mountains were the one place where he was not afraid of success . That sounds quite crazy , I know . But Nicholas , from the day he was born , knew he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , no . All he had to prove was that the world was worthy of him . Which is quite a task , when you think about it . And also , if you look at it right , it 's a very humble , self-effacing trait . It made him delicate , so easily hurt , so scared of succeeding out in the other world . He was scared that if he once succeeded there he would be forced to try it again , he would get the taste for it , the taste for competition , and then he would have no peace . He would be compelled to try it over and over again until finally he ran up against something that demanded more than he had , and44 A P P R O A C Hhe would know at last that the world was a place where you could be Nicholas and still fail , a loathsome place , a chasm in a storm . I never saw it when he was alive , but I know now that it 's true . Nicholas was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made people uneasy around him . People are sometimessuch cowards . They do n't know what to do with anyone capable of absolute contrition . They always think in terms of dichotomies and they equate contrition with the aggressive verbs that sometimes bring it about  --  to conquer , to subdue , to humiliate . People ca n't stand saints , really . They just ca n't understand them . Not that Nicholas was a saint . But that side of him was the side I loved , from the moment he first touched me with his hand . We were standing at the top of a boulder . There were only two days left , or three , before the climbing school was over . It had rained for the last few days and turned icy cold and we 'd all sat around in our parkas and shivered and eaten tons of chocolate and nuts and listened to the instructors give theoretical classes on the physics of lightning and high-altitude physiology and other dullingsubjects until we were quite insane with ennui and nonspecific desperation . When the weather finally broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one another and at the same time we were all so eager to get climbing that the whole group was simply greasy with friendliness . We could have picked our own climbing partners quite adequately by then , without any help from Nicholas . But he stood up there and parceled people out like packages of food . And he picked me for his rope team . I was almost sick with fury . During the whole ten days of the climbing school I 'd never climbed with Nicholas , and I did n't intend to now if I could help it . I thought his selecting me was a special burst of venom , accumulated from two long days of frustration . He knew how much I detested him and surely he must detest me just as much . What other reason could he have for picking me than a peculiar brand of sadism ? He was wearing his Annapurnas and they shielded his eyes like the hood of a cobra , but I went up to him anyway , tingling with defensiveness , APPROACH 45and told him I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing something on Teepee 's Pillar , something fairly hard  --  5.9 or 5.10 , and they had n't yet invented 5.13 . " What 's the matter ? " he said nastily . " Do n't think you can hack it ? " I felt like hitting him with a rock . We were camped quite high , on a nice big moraine , and there were these beautiful smooth flat rocks lying around everywhere and I stared at one and thought what a pleasure it would be to bring it smashing down on his head . I actually bent down and picked one up and held it in my hand , clutching tightly . " I 'm just afraid it will bore me , " I said . " But if you want to do it , hell , why not . I 've been bored enough since I got here ; I guess I can take a little more . " I 'd never talked like that , never . I dropped the rock and turned away , trembling , aware as I did so that something had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if I had actually hit him with the rock , as if his mother had scolded him for something he had n't done . I went to get my gear , and to find Orion and complain , but I kept thinking about the look on Nicholas 's face , the way you think about a beautiful moment , a moment when the air is still and all you can hear beneath the early sun is the crunch of your crampons on the snow . I suppose it really began then ; but I did n't know it , any more than you know the first time you hear that crunch on a morning ridge that you 'll never be able to live without it again , that you 'll come back over and over to find that moment , that sound , that journey upward across the snow . Nicholas 's look then just became a part of me , instantly and without words , and I did n't even have to admit that I treasured it . There was no admitting , no consciousnessinvolved . If I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served him right , " which certainly is typical  --  not just that my feelings and thoughts were often utterly at odds , not just that I was on the defensive from the start , but that my love for him was always touched with power , that I loved him because he was46 A P P R O A C Hvulnerable to me and also because I felt that in probing that vulnerability , in letting him reveal his helplessness to me , I was giving him the greatest gift I could give him and that more  --  soft words , caresses , help or adoration  --  was unnecessary , because what he needed more than anything was someone who could perceive his helplessness and administer pain like an antidote to his search for invulnerability . Not that the soft words did n't come . There were supposed to be two of us climbing with Nicholas that morning , but at the last minute Beckett decided not to go . It really is rather ironic that Beckett was at the school that summer , Beckett who later almost tore us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it  --  a delightful man , funny and half unhinged . Ryan and I had known him first in high school , had met him through the Outing Club the only year that we were all at school together ; we found ourselves walking alongside Beckett one day as we approached a climb . Though he was n't as good a climber as we were , it never bothered him in the least , and we all hit it off from the start . On an Outing Club trip one morning , when we woke up very wet , having slept without a tent and gotten hit with an early , soggy snowfall , I lay in a half sleep for hours , having to pee desperately but too immobilized by the little cocoon I had managed to make out of my damp Dacron sleeping bag to do anything but clutch the muscles of my abdomen to me like a football , until I had terrible cramps and could hardly move with the pain . I finally rolled over and muttered to Beckett that I felt dreadful , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came instantly awake and said to me , sympathetic as hell , " Lady pains ? " I had to giggle , even though that hurt worse . He got up and made a big pot of tea and filled a water bottle with hot water for me to hold until the knot in my muscles released and I could get up and pee and enjoy the damp sweet smell of morning . By the time Ryan got back from wood gathering , Beckett had me laughing like crazy . APPROACH 47Beckett loved to play games . Once we came back from a climb near Union Pass  --  me and Ryan and Beckett and two other guys from our high school  --  and we were eating some junk food in a sleazy hamburger place , where they had picnic tables put together out of what looked like condemned barn siding , on which endless generations of young locals had carved their initials and their remarks . Beckett had stayed out in the car for a moment and we were already sitting down when he came in , all of us grubby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in torn knickers and with a four-day growth of beard which looked like nothing so much as pubic hair . He had on a bright-orange balaclava and we were all sitting around dazed and exhausted when he came up to our table still carrying his ice ax , and rammed the tip of it into the boards with a tremendous crunch , his face contorted by anger . " So , " he said , his fake French accent cracking with the strain of expressing himself in such a foreign tongue as English . " You thought to leave me on the mountain , hey ? No one does that to old Pierre  --  and lives ! " If you could have bottled the silence that suddenly fell on that greasy spoon , it would have been as good as suddenly halving the population of the world . After Ryan went off to college , Beckett became my friend  --  a Ryan substitute , maybe . He had a great susceptibility to things that are not real  --  to stories of medieval courtesie , to tales of trolls and elves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die in each other 's arms  --  and in that he seemed a lot like Ryan . We hung around together at school and studied together for our exams and often in the evenings we took a rope out to Sinks Canyon to climb . I was really very fond of him  --  though never as a boy  --  and had suggested to him that he try the Jackson school . He had been nursing a sprained ankle , though , during the days we sat in the rain , and the ankle was still badly swollen the morning we were able to climb . Wrapped in an Ace bandage , it could not be stuffed into his boot . By the time he discovered this , most of the others had already left for their climbs , so ( although Nicholas as head instructor should certainly have taken more than one of us48 A P P R O A C Hthat day ) there were just the two of us together when we set off for the cliff . Later , of course , it occurred to me to wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would likely turn back ; but at the time as we made our way across the big moraine , all I was aware of was Nicholas 's presence . It pressed against me like a jet of water , powerful and intense . It was as if I were trying to cross a river and the sudden force of the current was riveting , so there was nothing I could do but lean into it and work with it , hoping the stream would n't knock me off balance , hoping I would n't be swept away . I had to lean toward it ; leaning away would have meant that I 'd drown in it . But we were perfectly balanced , the river and I , and in the boundaries of our balance we moved , not conversing . There was really nothing to say . Though I had known Nicholas for almost two weeks by then , it was as if I had never seen him before in my life , except once perhaps , long years before , when he had been a sudden face on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't speak to me either , all the way across the broad moraine , and though he carried the rope as arrogantly , as competently , as ever , I knew that he , too , was feeling what I felt , a dim sense of recognition , no more significant than a flash of deja vu , perhaps , but longer , enduring as we picked our way between the rocks . And when we got to a narrow spot between two boulders and we had to climb one boulder as big as a house to get beyond it , he leaped up , then turned , resting lightly on his boots like a dancer , and gave me his hand in silence , lifting me beyond the crux . That was it , then . His hand . He proffered it and I took it and when I reached the top of the boulder he stood looking down on the moraine we had crossed and I stood beside him looking down on it too , a maze of jumbled rock suddenly transformed from our new vantage point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no hurry to move on ; his piton hammer hung at his belt in an old leather holster and he linked one hand around it as he stood . There was a breeze gusting at times , quite warm , and from somewherebelow us in the rocks solid currents of air were flowing . InAPPROACH 49that gray-brown country , the colors of Nicholas 's equipment were as brilliant as desert flowers after a rain . The safety sling of his harness was crimson and the rope a royal blue . When we turned to go on , I knew that he wanted to give me his hand again , but he did not  --  and it did n't matter because I knew now that whenever I wanted to reach out and take it , that hand would be there , and because I was so full of wonder that he could risk himself that way ; he had courage far greater than any courage of mine , one which was concealed well by the armor of his skill on the rock and his hat brim pulled low across his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , climbs up long exposed towers are so repetitive that you can recall few details after they are over ; perhaps just the sweetness of the air , the gentle tapping of a hammer in the stillness , the red of a sweater against the sky . But even now I think I could write a guidebook on it , the endless jam crack , the tenuous traverse across the face . The rock was cold in the shadow and hot in the sun . Once a bat came squeaking out of a crevice as I drove in a piton , and looked at me malevolently before he flew away . Every time I leaned forward to trace a bit of mica in the rock with my finger , the clinking of the hardware racked across my chest was like the tinkling of bells , the rustle of aspen leaves in the forest . When we got to the base of the cliff , Nicholas stacked the rope and tied into the bottom of the stack , and what I might have seen before as a subtle test , a dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural politeness giving me the first lead . When I drove in a piton for the first belay , the steel rang neatly with an ever-ascending pitch , and the crack did n't bottom out but held the piton as sweetly as if it had grown there . We started living together that fall . I gave up my plans to go to college , with few if any regrets , and we rented a tiny metal trailer on a weed-filled lot in Jackson Hole . In those days it was almost impossibly hard to find a place to rent in the Hole . We50 A P P R O A C Hwere grateful when we found our little tin box . My mother did n't much approve of it , but she did n't much approve of Nicholas either , and at least we were n't jammed right up against someone else 's little tin box and actually had a view of sorts of Snow King and the ridge beyond it . But the place was so small that when we had stored our climbing gear and skis and junk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bed . So we slept on a bed in the other room , the one with the stove and the icebox and the table in it . I did n't care . If Nicholas left his running shoes or his helmet on the floor , right where you could n't fail to trip over them , I did n't care . They looked like him , they smelled like him , they were his objects : I would as soon have been annoyed at tripping over him as at running into his possessions . Every time he went out alone , the presence of his clothes , his books , his old guitar  --  and all these , in a space as small as ours , loomed very large indeed  --  gave me a sense of security and pride ; really , I suppose , of possessiveness . The helmet was not mine but it was better than mine . I owned the man who owned it . And that loop , that bypass , made them even more thoroughly mine than my own things , since my own quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time to see for what they were . Each hole in a sneaker , each scratch in a helmet  --  they were his birthmarks , and my talismans . That fall we ate a lot of bacon . Nicholas could n't cook anything but macaroni and cheese , bacon and toast , though he had some wild ideas about things like fondue , which we would periodically try and which would periodically end in near disaster , as when the hot oil almost tipped into his lap because I bumped the shaky table with my knee . So we ate a lot of bacon . It was not that I could n't cook or did n't have some idea at least of the variety of things you could prepare and then put into your mouth , but off the rock I tended  --  then  --  to be very reticent about suggestions . Nicholas was seven years older than I was , after all , and he 'd started off as my instructor . I assumed that he must have picked up some of the secret knowledge that you gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how to recognize secret knowledge  --  which would after all , to a novice , seem to be disguised  --  I settled for his ideas on shopping trips and we came home with bacon and toast . The toast would be broiled in the oven or fried in a pan full of butter ; the bacon ditto , though not at the same time . We would take to the table a platter of toast and a platter of bacon , sometimes leavened by a platter of sliced tomatoes . It was fine with me . I loved it . The diet bound us together as surely as sex did . I felt that we must both emanate the odor of pork grease and semen when we walked together down the street . We were really madly in love . He did n't know it , could n't know it , since his experience gave him no real basis for comparison and since his thoughts did not run to that kind of analysis . But I knew it , as surely as I knew my own history , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climb  --  although I had no basis for comparison either . And the irony was that only when I started to feel less sure of my need for him  --  though he had filled an empty space inside me , filled it forever , nothing could change that , and though he had , like a Universal weight machine , given me strength I never would have had without him to push and pull on , fifty leg presses and the ecstasy of rest  --  when the time came that , like someone in training , I began to wonder whether I should not just go ahead with the real competition , the battle of self-awakening , self-knowledge , leaving him behind , then and only then did he begin to see his need for me for what it was . A need not for a climbing partner but for someone he could care for , someone whose soul he could nurture and protect . In the beginning , though , every time he kissed me , thanked me , wrote me a letter , I felt that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a present like a helium balloon . I did n't see that the real favor he was doing was much larger than that one , the biggest favor you can ever do another person ; he was accepting the love I offered him , as if he were a bottomless pit , an infinite strip of blotting paper , absorbing all I could give . Poor man . He was addicted to me before he knew it . He used to joke about the52 A P P R O A C Hhippies too , with the careless scorn he reserved for the stupid . " Come on , " he 'd say , mocking drug dealers . " The first one 's free . " But that autumn was a hard one . We had no money , we had no decent jobs , and I was on the phone with Orion thirty times a week , moaning about how horrid Nicholas was . We fought a lot and almost broke up fifty times and more , even packing our things and striding to the door , while Nicholas told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him he was totally self-obsessed . The weather was rotten for weeks on end and no one was doing any good climbs . We tried to go to Yosemite , but the truck  --  the best three-hundred-dollar special in the state of Wyoming  --  broke down before we got out of the state . I refused to hitchhike all the way to California and we struggled back to Jackson with our incredibly heavy packs , cursing at each other all the way . SixWell , naturally we got married . That winter , in Jackson Hole . It was Christmastime and things were very festive ; red bells were hung on wires over the streets , and streetlamps were swathed in tinsel . All the houses were lit with fire , and chimney smoke wound up to the sky . Everything was crisp , if you know what I mean  --  people 's comments when they met on the sidewalk , the sounds of grocery bags and doors . And we felt crisp too , we felt like doing something , so when Ryan came up from Santa Fe we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know we were going to get married . All we knew was that we 'd quit our jobs . The weekend before , on the way back from skiing in Driggs , the truck had broken down in a blizzard  --  again  --  and Nicholas , after futilely trying to start the engine for almost thirty minutes , had bunched his fist together and smashed the dashboard , smashed the instrumentpanel , smashed the windshield itself , until the glass was all broken aid the vinyl a maze of cracks , and his hand was bleeding from a hundred tiny cuts . I was feeling close to crazy , since I could n't help him at all , and glad , I think , when something gave , as long as it was our jobs . I called Orion and begged him to come for Christmas . He got to the airport still dressed in a three-piece suit . We decided that night to go into the Gros Ventres . We had heard there was a cabin there , below the bowl of the mountains , 54 A P P R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that winter , it sounded easy to find . We 'd have a long ski in to Bootjack , but better a cabin than a tent , so we got out our double boots and greased them , then packed up a great deal of gear . Ryan , who fit better than we did into our diminutive trailer , kept hugging me and then hugging Nicholas who acted extremely annoyed , and then reading ridiculous directions from the insides of military surplus hats and pants . The pants and hats had come from the climbers ' school where we 'd all met ; because they lacked storage space they kept their extra equipment in an old automobile in an empty lot and one night when Nicholas and I were sleeping in the lot  --  that fall , before we found our little trailer  --  we had discovered that the " green car " was open , and stocked up on khaki clothes . " Place right leg in right trouser . Be sure to button fly , " read Ryan . Though Nicholas had n't wanted Ryan to come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he arrived , most of them had come from a fear of rejection , since he really liked Ryan a lot , and he wanted a male compatriot , actually , as much as he wanted me . So with that sudden grace he had , he impetuously gave in . Laughing , he still acted slightly gruff , but now rather more pleased . Outside , down the street , people were caroling and at some point in a fit of giggles we decided to sing along . Ryan had brought us matching socks for a present . They had little Christmastrees sewn into their borders and we put them on our hands and pretended they were puppets , giving us directions on what to take and what to leave behind . " One tent , " I said , quite firmly , " in case this cabin is a myth . " " One rope , " said Ryan after me , " in case we find a wild horse . " " One wife , " said Nicholas . " How about it ? You want to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a JP 's open that evening , we found one the following day . Nicholas held my hand all through it . And then we took our trip . APPROACH 55 Our packs were incredibly heavy and we decided to go in on skis . A recent snow had dumped a foot or two of powder all over the lower Gros Ventres , so we had to break trail for almost ten miles and were still skiing when the sun went down . We were in deep forest then and the temperature , which had been hoveringat just above zero , dropped suddenly to ten below with the exit of the sun . My double woolen mittens , wet from several epic falls , froze almost solid on my hands . " Let 's put up the tent , " I said . " How about it ? I 'm ready to eat some food . " Nicholas seemed to be willing , but Ryan wanted to go on . That in itself was such a strange reversal that I hardly protested at all , so we kept on skiing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fell behind , to a place where sounds were indistinct , and my hands , in just minutes , were numb and wooden as the trees . The moon began to rise and as it came above the outline of a treetop  --  like an ornament set at the top of a fine old broom  --  it threw a light across the snow that was almost as pure as dream light . The shadows of the branches were decals pasted neatly in place , and each trunk as it thrust down into the whiteness had a two-dimen- sionality as purposeful as art . In fact , the trees seemed to me to be full of intention , and in the great silence of interlaced shadows they mediated between me and my growing coldness like gentle guardians , more numinous than real . I lost sight of Ryan and Nicholas , slowed to a walk , and stopped . Who knows how much later the men skied back . They took one look at me , and then looked at each other , and without exchanging more than a few terse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reverse the slow process of freezing . Nicholas whipped off his pack and set it upright in the snow , and unzipping a bright-blue pocket , took out a spare set of mitts . Ryan took my pack off my shoulders , then knelt down and unfastened my skis , and by the time he had them off me , Nicholas was tucking mittens on my hands . In very little time , they had a sleeping bag stretched across the snow , and a stove roaring gruff reassurance , 56 A P P R O A C Hand Nicholas was taking my boots from my feet and then holding my feet on his bare stomach . Ryan thrust some tea into my hands , and dumped about a pound of sugar in it , and together they urged me into the bag and then took some time to consult . I was still very placid , and very unconcerned , and they decided that they 'd better find the cabin , if they wanted to be sure I 'd live through the night . As if from a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the stronger on skis , he would go find the cabin , while Ryan remained with me , and whatever jealousy he might ever have had , he certainly lost it then , since he watched while Ryan climbed in the bag and held me tight in his arms . I fell asleep . When I woke up , the moon had risen high into the sky . Ryan was gone , but my pack was still there , my skis set upright in a drift beside me . My boots , two tiny boats , were at their feet . Motionless , warm , I lay where I had woken . The luminous woods stretched all around me and the frozen stars had been hung . I have no idea how long I lay there , but certainly two hours had gone by while I slept . Finally , for something to do , I shouted a great hello , and from just behind me in the trees , Nicholas spoke softly . " We found the cabin . There 's a fire going . Come on , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress , and I let him help me dress , and then he strapped my pack to his , and led the way through the woods . Smoke was curling like lace from the chimney and the moonlight poured down from the mountain , and when Nicholas kicked open the door to the cabin , he picked me up to carry me through it . Ryan was standing at the woodstove melting cheese , which all of us drank like a liquid , and when a container of snow had been melted , we all drank gallons of that . And there was a line there for me , a line on one side of which was perfect bliss , the moment when all your mind and body comes together in the stillness and on the other side of which was sadness . Watching the cheese bubblingin the pot , and the soft kerosene glow on Nicholas 's hair , APPROACH 57I found it odd , somehow , that axes should hang on log walls , just so , and that cold should so easily kill . Odd , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one . Just before we went to bed that night , when Nicholas was already in his bag and I had yet to climb the ladder to the loft , he called down to me to bring him a pot  --  " What kind of a pot ? " " Any pot , Temis . A big pot "  --  and when I had located a pot , and handed it up the ladder , he bent his head over it and threw up into it , again and again and again , all of the water and all of the cheese and all of who knows what else , and then , without saying a word , took the pot to a wood-shuttered window and threw its contents out into the night . That night , before I managed to sleep again , I thought for the first time in many years of my father and the way in which he 'd been killed . Out inspecting an oil rig , he 'd been high on a scaffold when a girder had fallen , and the cable that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had swept him off the ladder and shoved him a hundred feet to rocky ground . No wonder my mother hated our climbs . But there it was and here we were . " Be sure to button fly . " The next day was utterly blue . We got up just before the sun and huddled around the stove , melting some snow . Nicholas was in very high spirits ; he 'd seen a snowshoe hare bounding away from the cabin when he emerged , and picking up a piton , had thrown it at the hare 's great legs . In one of those miraculous coincidences of thought and action , the piton had hit the rabbit squarely on the head , so we ate roast rabbit for breakfast . Nicholas cleaned it neatly and fried it like a gift . When the snow had melted , we all drank hot chocolate , and at one point Nicholas took my hand and held it tightly , then whipped out a kerchief to cover the link and tucked it under our thumbs . When Ryan , sitting with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , amused , Nicholas said quite gravely , " More sanitary like this . It helps to settle the germs . " We climbed the mountain by the ridge . We were n't out for a record , not then , just for a beautiful day . Ryan was best on rock , 58 A P P R O A C Hbut Nicholas was good on anything , and he started off in the lead , picking a pace that was perfect for all of us , and keeping it up with great ease . As he cut each step , his ice ax swinging easily in his hand , he was already halfway onto that step , his legs gliding over the air . His feet spread wide , he would stand relaxed for moments at a time , reading the ridge above him until I thought he would never move again , and then all of a sudden would move so swiftly that he made the slope seem quite flat . In the mountains in winter I never saw him look cold . On crackling mornings , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn over in his bag to light the stove , his bare fingers holding the metal as he pumped until the gas ignited with a roar . And that day , when a wind came out of the north so that the rope stretched out on the ridge between us was blown southward in great looping whorls , Nicholas simply pulled down his hat and kept on , quite undisturbed . Halfway up the first hard slope , Ryan 's crampon came loose . We stopped and stamped out a platform and ate lunch while he worked on the steel . With the same old-fashioned courtesy with which , the first night we ever slept together , Nicholas had asked if he could " put his arm around " me , he asked Ryan if he could help him with the crampon , and when Ryan said , " Of course , " the two of them bent over it , their heads almost touching , their four hands working as two . While they worked they told stupid jokes , which I heard with only one ear . Gradually the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his pants ? He was waiting for the snow blower "  --  and though usually such jokes do not appeal to me , that day everything seemed fine . When we left the platform , I took over the lead . The wind was blowing so hard on the ridge that I traversed into a gully on the left , but no sooner had I reached it than I realized there was ice about a hundred feet up into it . The sun was shining straight down the gully , and so dazzling was its glitter that I could n't really see if it came from snow crust or ice , but whichever it was , I was up for it , and I kept on cutting steps . I was cutting them deep and close together ; two or three blows of the ax , and the stepsAPPROACH 59were big enough to walk . Never had I felt so graceful . Never had I been so sure . I was only a small parenthesis in time , but I felt I was climbing toward eternity , and the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monarch 's robes . A cerulean blue . A cobalt blue . The blue of a sapphire in silk . How can you describe the feel of the mountains ? You proffer what they demand . And the more you give them , the more they will give you , so that  --  as in a martial art , where resistance simply increases the strength of surprise and you undo your partner by the simple act of succumbing  --  to climb is to know the way to submit , and by submitting , to win . The sun is so sharp on the snow when it shines and the blue so dark in the sky , and your boots have only one place to be , and that place is just where they are . And as I cut steps , and then more steps , I knew I could cut them forever . I stopped at last . Nicholas kissed me . Ryan took over the lead . Because of the wind , and the detour through the gully , it was late when we got to the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were all quite tired . When at last we sat at the summit , the sun was a molten pear , but we did n't hurry to get back to the cabin , we simply sat and stared . Nicholas crouched with his arms around his knees , and Ryan had his feet stretched out and crossed , and I lay back in the snow and watched while the sky turned black . To say I was happy would be lying . I was beyond happiness , in a moment out of time and space , when everything I loved seemed to erase me , and there was nothing that stood between me and the stuff that wove the world . At last both Nicholas and Ryan rose , and each held out a hand to help me up . Though each of them alone could hurt me , scare me , fail me , the two of them together  --  they never let me down , until they died . SevenWe drove to Dumre in a caravan of old buses which belched diesel smoke and roared like jets ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station because the driver could n't get the engine started after he turned it off , until , with a wonderful , phlegmatic calm , he discovered that by rolling the bus backward and kicking it hard in the side , he could coax it once more to action and we could leave . I spread out all over two of the seats , opened the window wide and watched the sights . There was a tiny triple-arched brick house set beside a lone tree in a field , a soft blue shirt draped over a bush in the breeze . Three small orange fires burned under the shelter of a spreading banyan tree . The green of the grass was intense and commanding and above the terraced paddies the erosion was like a netted hammock , spread carefully on the hill to dry . Tina kept giving us facts , which she dug out of a little book she had bought at a fruit seller 's stand . " Nepal is eroding away more quickly than any other country in the world , " she said , reading from page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hillside . My God . " She was silent for a while , then reported , " The infant mortality rate for children under five is over sixty percent . " When we pulled off to the side of the road to allow a canvas-covered truck to pass us  --  coming up , it seemed , from India  --  " Indian salt is crushed , " she said , " but Tibetan salt comes in lumps . " Her voice , thoughAPPROACH 61rather loud , seemed very soothing , and I listened to her as I fell asleep , to awake and find that it was raining , pouring down in great blinding sheets which turned the road into a river and drenched the little children who stood forlornly on the embankments , holding tins of bright-orange berries in their small brown hands . By then we were above the Trysali River , and when we got to Dumre , if the weather cleared we 'd be able to see the mountain . Tina led us in rowdy songs and I moved up and sat beside her , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything fell away . We slept in a muddy field that night , with the smell of dung all around us , and the next day started walking at last , just walking toward the snows . We were so low at Dumre it was as though we were in the tropics , with banana trees and grass-thatched huts and children naked on tatami mats . The heat was all but overpowering and the endless stone staircases a sort of endless joke . I started sweating that morning and did n't stop for a week and mostly I looked at my feet and not at the astonishing country around me . But I was walking again and nothing else mattered . We moved like a circus through the countryside , traveling jesters for all to see and enjoy . " Expedition or trek ? " a tiny porter asked as he passed me . He carried a crate of Coca-Cola and his tumpline was made of reeds . " Expedition , " I said . " All memsahibs ? " Delighted , he stared and stared . People always ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you started climbing , as if there were an answer , as if you could point to a particular piece of rock , argillaceousschist perhaps , something soft and boring , and say , " Oh , I just wanted to go on up . " You 'd think they 'd never perambulatedfrom one place to another without a set of wheels beneath them , you 'd think they 'd never felt the splendor of motion or the sense that somewhere up ahead there lies an answer . There was one little house that we passed , a house without walls , and in the62 A P P R O A C Hcourtyard a rooster strutted , his comb as red as raspberries . A little boy stood beside him , wearing a short red shirt , and when I saw them  --  the same size , the same colors  --  against the hard-packed dirt , hope exploded inside me like a detonation , it started burning slowly at the end of a long string fuse and then began to sizzle and splutter , rushing across the ground , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was alive again and walking , with a million stars dancing me along . The whole first week was like that . It was like  --  the only thing I can compare it to is suddenly being in love . Three days into the hills , I picked up an Indian newspaper from a table in a teahouse and almost every report was of a catastrophe  --  a disaster in which numerical equivalents tried somehow to capture the essence of mortality . You know . " Fifty-one people killed when roof collapses in Delhi " or " Twenty-three dead in train collision " and so on . All of which seemed so absurd , so distant , that I tossed it back on the table with a laugh  --  who could believe that news had any importance ?  --  andordered another cup of lemon tea . Everywhere I turned there were people I wanted to look at , people with smiles as open as the sun ; no crying children , no wailing , no beating of wives or husbands . And when one night , after an incredibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered on the horizon like the chorus of a Greek tragedy but never managed to release their water , Tina and I went for a swim in the river , walking across five or six rice paddies to get to a spot where we could be alone and taking off our clothes , seven men appeared from nowhere and stood in a silent , respectful line , waiting for us to emerge . What could we do ? We got out of the river as dignified as people on a pilgrimage and the men watched us as we got dressed . Tina was holding back the giggles , and finally she could contain herself no longer and said , to one man  --  who had been circling around in an effort to get all the best views  --  the only word she knew in Nepali then , " Ramro , " meaning " good . " " Ramro ? " She smiled , a foot taller than the man she spoke to , and half again as wide . APPROACH 63 " Ramro , ramro , " he said reverently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then turned around and waved . They all waved back . Could I ever have dreaded the smell of the sagebrush ? Everythingwas detail , but detail which revealed itself bit by bit and about which there was consequently no doubt . A baby hung in a square wicker basket from the gable end of a porch . Its kicking rocked the basket , endlessly soothing it . A child clutched a baby owl , nearly strangling it with pride , and offered it to us for five rupees , then four rupees , and finally for just one . In the soft mud outside a village a myriad of animal tracks had been impressed  --  water buffalo tracks , goat tracks , chicken tracks , pig tracks , and the stamp of bare human feet . The female Sherpas , the Sherpanis , held each other 's hands on the path ahead of us , singing in high tinny voices . Three tiny goats , small and gray , with floppy white ears , climbed on a boulder as if they were front-pointing . Except for Tina , I hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be time enough for that , I thought ; for everything . Once when we sat at lunch , high on a bluff above the Marsyandi River , an old man , a Brahman in rags , came , leaning on a stick , to stare regretfully at our spread tablecloth . For twenty or thirty minutes he stood there , not envious , just saddened  --  old and still puzzled by the mysterious working of life . Once he had had much . Now he had nothing . The packs were so bright , so ingenious , so new . He took up his stick and tiny cloth bundle and walked on . After a time he raised his umbrella and held his bundle behind his back . It was as if I were back in the sixties again , before I met Nicholas , before I became a well-known climber . Everyone was a flower child here . The wedding processions were marked by the sounds of flutes and drums ; women in gold-shot saris washed their clothes on flat wooden benches or bent each other over copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down as they crossed suspension bridges , making them into roller-coastersor the floor of a fun house . One of the porters  --  Ram , an ebullient , dashing young kid  --  wore a T-shirt that read " Never64 A P P R O A C HTrust Anyone Under 8,000 Feet . " The grass ran wild on the hillsides . One night that week , a few days after we reached the hills , Tina and I got into camp much earlier than the rest . We had taken by then to walking together , talking together , being together with unself-conscious ease . Although we are n't really anything alike , the Sherpas thought we were sisters and so did the kids we passed on the trail , and whenever people mistook us like that , we both were as pleased as children . Most of the team had lingered over lunch that day and stopped for some ehang in a teahouse , and a lot of the porters had stopped as well . Only the Sherpas had gotten to camp before us . In Ghoropani , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some chickens for our dinner and they were standing in the field , the rooster 's right leg tied to the hen 's right leg with a piece of dirty string . They were otherwise untethered . The rooster faced east and the hen faced west and both of them were disgruntled , peeved , especially the rooster . He kept picking up his free leg and putting it back in place , a tiny stomp of disgust . A tree was framed against the small bit of blue sky that still remained in the rapidly clouding canopy , and tendrils of blue smoke were light against the green . None of the tents had arrived yet , so we took a bath in the river , then sat beside the three cook fires , poking the flames with a stick . Very silent it was , very peaceful . Khanche , one of the porters , sat next to us , smoking a cigarette laced with hash . From somewherecame the smell of wild mint . I felt clean from my bath , tired from my day , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my marriage and other things . Scraps of memory came to me , then ripped away and blew off . Being with Tina was like being with a friend from high school ; maybe that was it . You remember how in high school you used to talk endlessly about the most absurdly abstract things ? Like would you ever die for a cause , and the wisdom of polyandry ? Well , I was recollecting sitting with my best friend in tenth grade , a friend I had totally lost track of in the years that I spent with Nicholas . Not that itAPPROACH 65was his fault he consumed me ; it was mine , my choice , and by then I had little in common with Wendy . But there we were , sitting on the concrete steps of the school building watching the wind blow an ice cream wrapper across the walk . Wendy had gone to California for the summer and met lots of boys , sophisticated boys , that is , not the kind you met in Lander , Wyoming , and we were talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't our intellectual equal . At least , those were the terms I insisted on discussing it in . Wendy , who was very bosomy and had soft red hair that curled under in a pageboy , wanted to discuss whether or not we would marry someone who was n't our intellectual superior , but I would n't do that . That was too ridiculous for me to even waste my breath on . After I had made it clear that of course , number one , I was never going to marry anyone at all , I maintained quite stoutly that there was no need for this nonexistent man to be my intellectual equal . He could be as stupid as the day was long and I would marry him anyway if I loved him . That 's what women 's rights was all about . Wendy was doubtful . But I got quite irate , stamping my foot on the pavement with all the fervor of confusion : Did I want to marry anyone quite that stupid ? I never had the least patience with even the semi-brights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would have to be better than we were in something , otherwise it would be just too dull . Then we went downtown , I think , and drank root beer floats while Wendy told me about making out on the beach to the sound of the surf with someone who wanted to go " all the way " and told her she had beautiful eyes . I was fascinated , the more so since I had never made out with anyone myself . Anyone , that is , except my brother Ryan . Not that we ever slept together . Or rather we slept together many times , in beds , in fields , on walls , and slung in hammocks . We watched a lot of dawns and sunsets and smelled the first clean snows of many winters , and often , when it was very cold , we zipped our bags together and slept in each other 's arms . We66 A P P R O A C Htouched each other too , with hands that looked remarkably alike ; we studied each other 's skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete that it erased the line between all pain and pleasure of the flesh . I do n't know when that started ; I just know that whatever guilt we felt was merely at our difference from the normal run of men  --  at our sense that we inhabited a place so special that anyone who knew of it might envy us and wonder what the two of us had done to earn such grace . I got to know my brother 's body better than I knew my own and my sensitivity to the slightest touch of his fingers was a sea I floated in , a moon that bathed me in light . Yet the kind of sadness that so often follows unfulfilled desire never overtook us and we could move from such immersion to the clarity of full sun and start off on a climb full of that directed strength which can heal even darker , harder unions . No wonder I 'd never made out . Though I was theoretically eager for love , I despaired of ever finding someone other than my brother who liked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending all my spare time in the mountains . Anyway , I was thinking about that  --  about the fact that when I was young and convinced I was never going to marry , it was , I thought , because I was convinced that I would never meet a stranger I wanted to spend more than two hours at a time with , a man who would not after that become a burden . And in Jackson the year before , just about the time I got the invitation to the expedition , I had had my first affair in seven years of marriage and Beckett and Nicholas were both willing to do almost anything to hold me . All these groupies were hanging around the shop too , wanting my body , I gathered , mainly because they wanted to put another notch in their piton hammer , and I had begun to have again that incredulous , disgusted sense I had had in high school , the sense that I was never going to meet a man who did n't , finally , bore me . Only now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blame myself for it . I felt that I had been continually growingA P P R O A C H 67stronger , tougher , more able to cope , and that with every bit of growth I achieved  --  as a climber , as a seeker of truth  --  I was making it more and more difficult to stay interested in Nicholas . Not to put too fine a point on it , there were a lot of things that I could n't respect in him , and I could admit then , though I had been unable to do so in high school , that in the end that was what I wanted  --  someone I could , if not exactly look up to , at least respect profoundly . I could n't stop myself from wanting to grow until I almost floated away , yet I felt that really I was cutting the branch I sat on . Because God , how I wanted to love him . Tina was still sitting beside me , drying her hair and not sayingmuch , and the pressure cooker with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bundles of wood purchased at a nearby farmhouse were stacked around the embankment we sat on . Hakpa sat beside us and kept hitting my knee with his as he peered across the valley to try and spot the porters with the tents . The pressure of his knee , brown and tight as a drum , was very friendly and reassuring and I tried to bring myself back to the present . I wanted to tell Tina something of what I 'd been thinking , but just as I was about to , the first few drops of rain fell . Tina got to her feet then and stretched her arms above her head , and as she stretched , her breasts came tight against her shirt  --  a lemon-colored shirt with the logo " Climbing is hard , but not as hard as growing up " sketched on it , front and back  --  and then she sat down with a smile and leaned over and gave me a hug . When some porters arrived with the tents , the Sherpas all converged on them , eager to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it started to rain , to pour , the skies unloosed and rushing to the ground . The Sherpas got the cook tent up , holding its sides , which flapped wildly in the sudden wind , and before the cook fires could go out  --  hissing in rage at the great drops which landed among their flames  --  stretched a tarpaulin over the triple conflagration . Everyone was rushing about and suddenly porters were starting to arrive , pieces of plastic spread over their heads68 A P P R O A C H A P P R O A C H 69and across the tops of their loads . So I had no chance to speak to Tina , but I did n't think , then , it would matter . I ran for myparka , thinking of all that once had ruled me ; no loss if I was done with it for good . That night it thundered , and lightning reached down to the hills with a hundred forked fingers . In twenty minutes the expeditiontents were up , the duffel distributed inside them , the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trail into camp , making sure no one missed it in the deep storm dusk , holding a tall pole in one hand and pointing to the pines with the other , for all the world like a knight guarding the gates to the city or the door of his mistress 's chamber . We were now in big country , space so big it swallowed us up , and the Sher pas seemed to feel they had gotten home . A porter , after he dumped his load , did a manic dance in the rain . The Sherpanis were singing from the shelter of their tent and our Sirdar , Tensing , looking very jaunty in his new Gore-Texparkalittle short-brimmed hat , personally dug the trenches around hetents , staying as clean while he did it as Teflon . No mud would dare attach itself to him . The storm stopped later in the evening , just as we sat down to dinner on our wicker stools . Hakpa had somehow managed in the torrent of rain to prepare fried chicken , fried potatoes , chicken soup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lentil slush ) , and , if you can believe it , cake , and six Sherpas carried the food in , giggling , while Hakpa hovered behind them , his expression serious and intent until we burst into applause and everyone went off to eat , happy as so many kings . What with the long day and the rain , there was little talk for a while . We addressed ourselves to our food . Some cups bobbed on the guy lines of the tent and we watched them as if they were the evening 's entertainment . Then some Manangi traders arrived on ponies and they rode by the dining tent , showing off theirhorsemanship and good looks . They were all wearing Westernstyleclothing  --  blue jeans and baseball caps  --  and some of them had radios hanging on straps around their shoulders . Their ponies were dressed as if for a circus , heavy with bells , glittering with mirrors , fringed with purple and pink plumes . We watched them  --  they were better than cups  --  and after dinner Naomi and Tina got rides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ass . Some of the traders spread out tarpaulins at the edge of the field , next to the last of the climbers ' tents . Margaret , who had been in Nepal for three months now , long enough to know exactly what is worth paying for , dickered for an hour over the purchase of a whole set of old brass horse bells set on a worn leather collar . Robin , though she did n't buy anything , looked over a couple of prayer wheels and some small wooden rice bowls with ill-fitting lids . In the middle of the night we were awakened . A piercing scream brought me bolt upright  --  and then a couple of shouts , running feet and tent flaps being unzipped kept me there . Robin had requested a single tent that night and apparently had sat in the doorway combing her hair before she went to bed . So naturallyone of the traders had got ideas and came back and stuck his hand inside her sleeping bag and squeezed one of her breasts . She woke the whole camp with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all , she 's a married woman , with two children at home ; she 's had her breast squeezed before . She did n't talk much at breakfast ; she seemed to think that screaming bloody murder the night before had proved to us all without hope or mistake that she would never become a great climber . Of course , later that proved to be true , but everyone went out of her way that morning to cheer Robin up , to say that they would have done exactly the same thing in her place . Naomi joked good-humoredly that if she were Robin , she 'd sue , that was all , she 'd take the trader to small-claims court  --  Robin has very small breasts  --  and at least come out ahead by a prayer wheel , a pack of cigarettes , a rug . The pun set us to70 A P P R O A C Hlaughing , and even Robin managed to smile . We set off that morning with more fellow feeling than we 'd had before , thinking we were over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the next day , we saw the mountain at last . The tropical climate of the lowlands had given way to a colder , leaner air . But we were still ten days away from base camp , a straggling , slow crusade , and we had not yet had a really clear morning greet us from the north , where the morning sky normally looked like the anatomy of a storm , laid out as in a child 's primer . So I was unprepared when Pasang , waking us with hot wash water , added to his perennial cheerful " Good morning , memsahib "  --  the good morning not of a nurse to a difficult patient but of one incarnate soul to another , as if the morning that we shared must inevitably make us one  --  the news that the sky was clear and the mountain could be seen . I bolted out of the tent in nothing but my long johns . At first I could see only the thin blue sky , the distant hills , the great green bowl around us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an image coming up from silver-treated paper , a line of white like a wave rising from the sea , ethereal , transitory , vulnerable to the touch of a finger  --  the mountain , our mountain , the mountain I had come to find . Beyond the mountain a cloud hovered , a long lenticular cloud that did n't touch the summit but stood above the stillness of its upper reaches , a ghost cloud waiting , like me , to be sucked back in to the spell of the mountain , by the incantation of dreams . And though Nicholasentered my thoughts , and Ryan , and I remembered a hundredclimbs when I had roped with them , racking the hardware as neatly as a palette of colors , the memory was as vaporous as the cloud beyond the mountain and I felt  --  if I felt anything at all  --  that I was glad to be alive , fiercely glad , triumphantly glad , even if they were dead . If I had ever told myself that I would climb the mountain only because they would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory of them , I could retract that taleAPPROACH 71now as nothing but the treachery of guilt and admit that I was climbing the mountain for no one but myself , because one morning long ago I had risen in the Tetons before dawn when the sun was a golden censer over a sharp horizon , and the ridge lay just below it , a white place waiting to be marked . EightThe autumn we bought the shop , it rained a lot . Somehow we had managed to survive our first two years . Mainly because we 'd started climbing with Orion , and Ryan always healed us , like a wash of herbal balm . He 'd been promoted twice already , and had gotten a job in design , and he was making lots of money , which he wanted to lend to us . I think he thought that buying the shop would root us ; but right from the start , the shop was a big mistake . After we finally opened for business , Nicholas used to come home from working tight as a fist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had assumed magnificent proportionsin his mind while he served a customer or went through the stock lists . Suddenly his whole life would fall into place like the sections of an orange around this central , ragged point of reality  --  which was , say , advertising the shop in the Casper paper , or getting the brake drums on the van reground before the week was out . If these things were not done instantly  --  faster than instantly  --  all other plans we had made were worthless , might as well be scrapped . But he had no time , no time , that was always the problem  --  and so he expected me to produce instant action on this thing , whatever it was , which was important only to him and only because it represented the potential for a real completion in a world where no completion satisfied him ever . Except a welldrivenpiton . Except a graceful move . When I declined to act  --  76 TH E GLACIERwhen I put it off  --  when I showed anything but instant and wholehearted agreement  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since this too would have to be done by him , this too , in addition to all the other details of his life , my own cherished dreams would never come to pass . We would n't be able to try a new route on Mount Owen that weekend ; he 'd be too busy fixing the brake drum . He claimed that I wanted to keep him from climbing . He controlled me by his disdain . Well , it was n't really disdain . It was , I think , a kind of worldwearyennui , an ability to negate our relationship totally by a word . After a fight , an argument , even a disagreement , when I would be in the process of repairing the rent , examining the cause of the explosion , I might say , " You tend to put words in my mouth , Nicholas , " or some equally universal lament , and he would say , " Well , you wo n't have to worry about that anymore , " in his mind already halfway to the airport , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to analyze the nature of a relationship she was not in her heart convinced was a good one , to someone determined at all costs to hold on to that relationship . He was always so damned ready to take off ; it made me determined to prevent him . To discount our relationship that easily  --  to say , at every possible opportunity , " So long "  --  every ounce of stubbornness I possessed would be marshaled against his casual dismissal . He talked about " picking up his own life once more , " as if it were something he had dropped along the trail somewhere and had now to go back and get , something that was by its very nature invisible to me , a piece of equipment too specialized for me to understand , which , had he had it with him all along , would have made it impossible for us ever to be together at all , his own life being unarguably male , a backpack that , once he shrugged into it , held him incommunicado , a mystery behind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's as simple as that  --  you 're comparing me to your brother ... it 's as simple as that  --  we just ca n't get along , " used to stop me dead , as if I had in fact come up against that lead-lined wall , smack , soTHE GLACIER 77hard my nose grew white . Perhaps I was comparing him to my brother . My brother , at least , believed in choice . After my father 's death , one night when my mother was sobbing , he took out a frying pan and started to cook , though he 'd never cooked before ; and if it was n't the best meal I 'd ever eaten , at least it was n't watered by tears . But Nicholas believed in destiny , and most of what made him impossible stemmed from that simple fact . I see now , of course , that Nicholas 's blunt hammer of sudden judgment was simply a powerful tool , and that without realizing what he was doing , he pitted his contempt against my obduratenessand held me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a good technique , when you think about it , a technique that bears a marked resemblance to giving someone a rope long enough to hang himself . How long a rope does that take , after all ? Not one hundred and fifty feet of kernmantel , that 's for sure . One rather threadbare six-foot length of clothesline will do the job quite nicely . And he had it  --  " I 'm leaving , it 's as simple as that "  --  and would hand it to me regularly , returning with one toss the sum total of that insignificant , contemptible affair which was , it seemed , our partnership . Until I fell at his feet in tears once more . And we went on . Still . I do n't know if this makes sense , but I continue to think of a lot of the fights Nicholas and I had as nothing but pure release . Not our earliest fights , of course ; but later , after I had started to learn the subtle rules of our warfare , it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship with Nicholas was that he made it possible for me to express my own anger without having to feel guilty about it later . I suppose in a way I have always confused excitement with happiness and seen catharsisas a prime ingredient for joy . So the autumn we bought the shop , it rained a lot . Nicholas was sick , he had got the flu , caught it from me , in fact . I had been laid up in bed for two days while he did the work around the house and gave me precious little sympathy . He did n't believe I was really ill , I suppose , largely because he himself was healthy as a78 THE GLACIERhorse and he thought that if it were a serious flu bug he would catch it from me . Well , finally he did . And he spent three days in bed , not two , and moaned with frustration at the fact that life was passing him by . Having been vindicated anyway by the virulenceof his sickness , I could afford to be kind to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazines , with a metronomicregularity . By the end of the third day I was getting a little bored with this , as he seemed to all appearances to be quite recovered , and I told him I was going out for the evening , to spend some time in the library and maybe stop in at the bar . Well , that set it off . He did n't want to be left alone . He wanted me to stay and talk to him . He felt a lot better . Maybe we could even make love . Or if not , we could read together . Orion was coming up soon . Should n't we decide what we wanted to do when he arrived ? Nicholas used every means at his disposal to get me to stay with him , entirely missing the point that what I needed was some time alone . So it built , as such things do . Did n't he appreciate all I 'd done while he was sick ? I said . Could n't I see that just this once he really wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it went , increasing in volume and exasperation until finally , when he said something about the fact that if I did go out I could certainly forget about making love when I got back  --  he would be much too tired then , probably asleep  --  I said , " Well , fuck you , Nicholas . What ever gave you the idea I wanted to make love with you anyway ? " And I finished by giving him the finger . I was standing in the doorway of the room and he was lying back on the bed , pillows propped behind him . As I started to turn my back on him he reached for the nearest object at hand , which happened to be a glass bottle of ointment , and , his face contorted by rage , threw it as hard as he could onto the floor at my feet . It was a very thick glass bottle and instead of breaking it bounced and when it bounced landed right on top of my unshod foot , hitting it just between two of the thin bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell ; and though it was perfectly evident to me that Nicholas had not tried to hit me , that the bounce was THE GLACIER 79purely accidental , and equally evident that he was in a dangerouslyuncontrolled state of mind , filled with the peevish self-pity of a convalescing invalid , I felt at that moment that it was necessary for me to return blow for blow , that if I let him get away with such things there would be no end to them . Stupid as hell on my part ; I actually managed to convince myself  --  in the four seconds I stood motionless before I stooped to pick up the bottle  --  that it would be better for both of us if I drew the line right there . So without really wanting to , but feeling a kind of weird responsibility to myself and to him , I tossed the bottle back at him , aiming for the covers on the far side of the bed . Naturally , I missed . Had I been trying for the most excruciating return I could arrange , I could n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the shin . With a howl of rage he threw back the covers and came at me , wearing only the bottom of a pair of string-tie pajamas . He hit me on the arm , his fist bunched together like a knot of rope , and though I had n't really been angry before , I got angry then , and unloosed myself on him like the Furies . A shadow of fright crossed his face . He had n't realized I was going to be in this kind of mood , the totally no-holds-barred mood that came over me , rarely but definitively , when I did n't feel like messing around with words . He was n't sure he was up to it , obviously . He was still a little bit sick , after all . But it was too late and he saw it was too late , so he decided to make the best of it . That mood I was in then , it was the same mood , really , that came over me last fall when Nicholas , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , told me he had invited one of our friends , a female friend , to go climbing with him for the weekend and I found out to my absolute astonishment that I was an intensely jealous woman . I shouted to him at the top of my lungs that if he did , I was going to cut his balls off with a rusty knife , and all I felt about my own behavior was a kind of detached interest  --  like the kind of interest I felt when I took off my boot in Ghoropani and found it full of blood , discovering thus my first80 THE GLACIERleech and the ease with which it had joined me  --  that I was , in fact , that kind of woman , and not , as I had fairly consistently imagined , the other kind . Well , the mood then was the same , though the astonishment was not present . I knew I was not the other kind when it came to a physical fight , and I punched him back on the arm as hard as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost it , Nicholas and I. Not then . Not ever . He hit me on the arm , I hit him on the arm  --  but he never broke my jaw , I never kneed him in the balls ; even at our most unhinged we never lost it that much . I never feared him physically , which is perhaps another way of saying that deep down I trusted him with my life . And I could see , even as he brought his fist down on my shoulder , that he was holding back his force as much as he was releasing it ; it was a perfect study in kinetic and potential energy . In fact , he looked as if he were about to explode from the conflict , the conflict between the desire to just once really let me have it , slap me around until we were both quite black and blue , and the desire to protect me from harm , even harm that was channeling straight through him . He shoved me against the wall and I kicked him in the shin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where I grabbed his ear and tried to twist it off . He stuck his thumb into my neck and I beat down on his back . We were both panting , audibly , and had our teeth clenched tight , and I was well aware of the way we would appear to a sudden , startled visitor  --  like two people who were totally out of control . But we were n't , not at all . I tripped over a chair and picked it up and held Nicholas off with it . When he wrested it away , I managed to pick up another chair and break it against a wall . At that , Nicholas kicked the wall with his foot so that there were two holes in it , one foot-sized and the other the size of a chair leg . His hole seemed much more significant than mine and that impelled me to try and slap his face , though it was a struggle to overcome my own reluctance to really hurt him . As a consequence , the slap was very light and ineffective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 81excuse to slap my face , and he brought his hand up and then down across my jaw . It was a very feeble blow for so strong a man , but I managed to squeeze everything out of it that I could and spun around with the violence of the assault , letting it knock me to the floor , onto which I fell like an uprooted tree , landing half on the carpet and half across the hard edge of a couch . The next day , when I examined myself for permanent wounds , the only bruise I had was on my arm , where a great patch of blue beneath the elbow marked the spot which had come into contact with the couch , a contact I could easily have avoided had I not desired to fling myself to the floor . All those feelings , gone forever , wherever feelings go . After hauling myself to my feet and daring Nicholas to come after me , I put on my parka and stormed from the house . A light snow was falling and the limpid circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King that night , and with each step I took above the town I felt more and more pure , as if a clean rain had washed right through me , as if I were almost light enough to float to the top . Halfway up the mountain , I stopped and looked down on the glow of the lamps from the town below , rising through the mist of falling snow like smoke . After great effort , purity descends . Words , spoken or thought , are euphonious as temple bells and the shadows that fall from the trees lie on the ground like purple velvet . When I got home , we did n't talk , but pulled the quilt , tiny roses and baby 's breath , over us , and opened the window wide . When I tried to explain how I felt , Nicholas shushed me . We made love into the small hours of the night . So part of my love for him was all that . The part that was easiest to be sure of . The part that required no effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was that he could always make me laugh . Not that he always bothered or found it possible to try . But though a lot of people thought Nicholas was a somber man , he could laugh as deeply and as freely as he could cry and for as little cause . He had an innocence about him , an innocence which was , perhaps , born of never having felt shame . In high school I knew a82 THE GLACIERgirl , the daughter of a very wealthy rancher , and something about being born so rich gave her a quality of innocence . It was n't as if she had never suffered , no , not that , but as if she had never felt shame , as if there were no reason in the world for her to suspect herself of being bad . And Nicholas , though he was ten times more paranoid of authority than the average person  --  if you could judge by the lengths he went in order to avoid exposure to it  --  was paranoid somehow not because he felt he had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , it outraged him so much , that he had once or twice been unfairly accused . But the point , I suppose , is that he figured anything he had ever done had been justified at the time ; he could have acted no differently , ever , than he had . So although he suffered many kinds of torments , he never suffered guilt . And that was extraordinary to me , miraculous , if often infuriating . It may have been the reason our fights so often ended as they did , with me at his feet in tears , but it was also the reason he could always make me laugh . In me , guilt has always been ready at hand . If a policeman were to accost me and accuse me of any monstrous thing , there would be a moment , I know , an endless sickening moment before I could deny the charge , hotly calling down vituperation on his head  --  and that moment would exist because I would know quite well that , whatever it was he accused me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions , I would be quite capable of doing it . The fact that I had not done it would seem to me , in a way , accidental . I do n't know if you can understand this , really . But I 've always been aware , ever since I can remember , that I was not a really good person , that I did n't have the proper instincts , to help and to love , to give . And though I 've always liked myself anyway and made a certain defiance part of my self-image , I have also been afraid of this non-goodness , afraid of the things I might do . Once when I was a child and we passed an accident on the highway , an accident around which twenty or thirty people had already gathered , I slumped down in my seat and hid on the floor of theTHE GLACIER 83car lest I accidentally catch even one brief glimpse of blood or death , going so far as to cover my eyes with my hands and press down on the eyeballs so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one after another in quick succession . I did n't know why at the time , of course . Later I thought it was because I was n't about to become like those others , gawkers , hangers-on at tragedies , sickening shallow people who probably gossiped at home night and day . But it was really because I was so scared of what I might find in myself . What if I liked what I saw on the highway ? What if I wanted to poke at the blood ? Every time I read about something just too horrible to think about  --  the Indiansflaying a man alive , for example  --  I would be so absolutely repulsed ( " How could they do such a thing , how could they be human and do it ? " ) that I never allowed myself to answer my own question nor to see that my horror had an element of fascination . Though most people are like that , I have since discovered , and a lot of kindness results from the fear of being cruel . But Nicholas  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was not that kind . He was never purposely cruel . And since nothing came from malice , the deep wells of his love were never muddied by doubt . So when he was feeling strong he could make me laugh until I gasped for breath . And when he was feeling tender I felt as safe as a trumpet in its case . A week after he had recovered from the flu we went to climb Mount Owen and I had a relapse , and when we got up for the climb before dawn I was so tired , just burned out , that I could n't stop yawning . Nicholas had already gotten the coffee and the oatmeal made , but when he saw the way I felt he took his fingers and put them on my eyelids and closed them , not even talking , just making it clear the mountain could wait . And he had no patience , remember ; things never happened soon enough for him . Or when I flew back to Jackson from my visit to Orion in Santa Fe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaced and he was waiting for me with a bunch of flowers , holding them in his hand like a banner . He thought that was what you did , you understand , to show a woman84 THE GLACIERyou loved her . Give her flowers . But it was n't the flowers . It was the way his hand was wrapped around them . If a policeman had ever stopped him and accused him of monstrous acts , he would n't have paused for a second . He did n't have that tiny tickle of guilt . But he carried , in a way , the burden of excessive sensibility . He was capable of so much feeling , such passion , such attachment to the moment of pain or ecstasy , and he did n't admit that to himself , except to try and control it , to try and keep it from harming him . Which was futile from the start , more than futile , because it was never the burden of such sensibility that caused him pain  --  in the realm of emotion , really , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but the degree of his refusal to accept responsibility for that burden , to accept that he was not a simple gunslinging cowboy but a man who was unusually sensitive to the potential for purity in life . He was confused by that potential , the way everyone is confused . He loved to read history , where truth is laid out on a platter like a series of slices of ham , and he , as much as any of us , had imbibed the basic tenet of science on which most modern life is based , that truth is somehow absolute , if elusive . So the ever-changing nature of the truths he sensed , with the deep sensibility he did not admit to , was something that frightened him so much he never even let it past the door to his mind . And the pain he felt was really from that rejection , a self-inflicted wound . I tried to explain that to him again and again . He just looked at me like I was the crazy one . But Nicholas never had much faith in words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more real than the words we use to describe it and his feelings far more complex and comprehensive than the sad little bundle of sounds we use to try and contain them . If the language had as many words for love as the Eskimos do for snow , then we might perhaps be getting closer to the core of things . As it is , though , hell  --  how does " happiness , " for example , relate to the reality of days ? How does " hate " suppose it can support the flux that drives it ? THE GLACIER 85And Nicholas saw that . Or rather he did not see it , but he let it rule him , so that feelings came and went across his life like wind across the surface of a lake , undefined , uncaught , unrecognized and then gone . And maybe that 's why he was no ripe field for guilt , because what is unperceived when it occurs simply does not exist , and when he tried to look back upon his life , few moments of passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his inability to connect experience with the words that attempt to describe it was not unlike the inability to connect acts with their consequencesand had a flattening effect upon his past . His mountains , once climbed , sank down to sea level , and the whole of his thirtyoneyears became , in memory , a long undistinguished plain of sand . And from that grew a frustration as profound as that of any unhappy child who , living so fully in the present , can not imagine a future in which the present will be past . No matter how many mountains he climbed , he had never climbed enough . But the funny thing is that once I started meditating , I began to see that Nicholas , far more than any books or meditations , had been in fact my teacher and lived always heartbreakingly near the edge of true enlightenment . True enlightenment . And what is that ? It 's something , clearly , that can not be seen until you 're upon it , but according to the dharma , the path to it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emptiness  --  to admit that all our feelings , multitudinous and variegated though they may be , are nothing but desperate attempts to prove to ourselves that we exist , and that suffering is perhaps the most efficient way to do it . So when I began my study of the dharma , I realized that the very intensity of the emotions that Nicholas aroused in me and that he lived with was perhaps the greatest gift he could have brought me , since I had seen the faces of both love and hate as fully as any person ever could and also seen the emptiness that follows them . It 's like giving up cigarettes by smoking them till you 're sick  --  and there are people whose function in life is to86 THE GLACIERforce you to smoke them , locking you into a room until you retch and retch and finally are drained . I tried to tell that to Tina , when the storm was all around us . She told me at the end , though , I should climb the mountain alone . TrineIt was after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come together as a team . The hills were getting higher , the gorges deeper , the hillsides far more steep . Little villages would pop out at night like fireflies from the woods above us and in the daytime we passed through settlements built around and between granite boulders as large as the houses they sheltered . Ancient trees were chopped down for firewood and every bit of arable land was under cultivation , although the corn looked poor and sickly and often the terraces were washed away . Sometimes we came to pine forests that reminded me of the Wind Rivers of Wyoming , while the great sweeping curves of the Marsyandi  --  growing tougher and stringier as it retreated to its source  --  seemed to bring the nine of us together in common cause , giving us a familiar setting around which to stage our evening meetings and to organize our acquaintance . In the evenings we talked about climbing , past and future , until Naomi left the campfire with one or another of the Sherpas , and Margaret and Taffy Anderson  --  who were friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to Katmandu  --  went off to talk together , and then Dervla would tell us stories , her enormous wide gaping smile gleaming in the dusk so brightly you almost felt she had caught beauty from her beautiful black husband . She plied Sibyl , the one full-time adventurer among us , with questions about the Amazon country , 88 ' F Ii E GLACIERwhere she hoped someday to study , and Sibyl told us about crossing the Sahara with camels . Robin played the flute , her long blond braid hanging all the way to the ground . Sometimes Tina and I went bouldering after dinner and when we came back we sat and stared for a while at the coals of the fire , which looked like phosphorescent paint on the bottom of the pot that rested in their midst . One evening it was raining out , cold and stormy , and we sat around the dining tent quite late . Tensing kept popping his head through the flap like a worried mother to see if there was anything we needed , and the Coleman lantern had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for just that necessity . With the heat of the lantern and nine large bodies , it was very cozy and some of us dragged our ensolites in to lie on . We were talking about climbing , of course , and after the usual quota of personal anecdotes  --  most of them tales of disaster  --  Tina said she had always found it strange that most of the metaphors people assign to mountaineering are warlike ones . People talk about an expedition as a siege , a thrust , an assault , a penetration , though actually the reason a lot of people go climbing is that they can achieve on a mountain an intimacy , a kinship , a cessation of the competitive that they ca n't find in many other places today . So of course Naomi drawled , " Except in a war , " and Tina got very excited trying to explain that it was different from war , because it did n't involve any killing , that the only thing that was at risk was you . And Margaret , partly to avert an argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said : " Of course , those metaphors are n't exclusive to either mountaineeringor warfare ; indeed , they simply reflect the Western conception of reality . " Well , we talked about that for a while and the fact that yes , there was no getting away from it , on the face of it climbing a mountain did seem a perfect symbol for the kind of logicality that admits no boundaries , that it reflected an almost childlike beliefTHE GLACIER 89in progress , the idea that there is a long , thin line of time leading in one direction , into the golden age of the future , where all happiness is found . At least , most of it did . Robin seemed to be dozing , and Laurie was reading Messner 's book on Everest . She 's such a fanatic that she does n't just read mountaineering books when she ca n't be in the mountains ; she even reads them while she 's climbing . And I was feeling so good , so absolutely there , that I never wanted the evening to end and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain at all but could just stay warm and cozy in that dining tent forever , getting to know each other and proving , to ourselves at least , that summits are not the important thing , the important thing is starting toward them . After a while , everyone left except Tina , Naomi and me ; for once Naomi had decided not to sleep with one or another of the Sherpas , which made me feel uncharacteristically fond of her , and really quite at peace . The next morning we all woke early , full of renewed vigor . The rain had stopped overnight ; the mountain was in sight . The breakfastporridge was thicker than usual  --  Hakpa had outdone himself , with that and with a kind of white-bread cake , iced in playful curlicues of peanut butter and jam  --  but we hardly had time to enjoy it in peace , as everyone seemed especially eager to be off . The Rai porter who carried most of the wicker stools settled himself about five feet from the table , eyeing the stools as hungrily as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , he whisked her seat away before it had time to cool off , and tossed it onto his load . As usual , the cook crew had taken off even before we sat down to breakfast  --  all except Pasang , who waited at a good distance until he was sure we were finished , then deferentially gathered up the remaining pots and pans , the teakettles and the serving trays . When his basket was packed , only two frying pans protruded from the neatly tied rope that held the load in place , and he slipped the tumpline around his head and set off quickly so as to reach the lunch site before any of the expedition members . But90 THE GLACIERTina and I followed him and with us came Ang Nima , who had been deputized by Tensing that day to be the " Membars ' " mother hen and make sure that none of us got lost or mugged or ran away . I was beginning to feel a great security in being with the Sherpas , the confidence that comes from spending time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can give , who accept you as the person you are and do so because they have a wholeness themselves , an air of being rooted firmly in the present moment , able to deal calmly with anything that moment may reveal . We walked along in happy silence , and when after an hour or two of walking we all stopped at a stone chutora to rest , setting our packs on the slabs beneath a pipal tree , Tina and I picked up the Sherpas ' loads and set off up the trail . By the time the Sherpas realized we were not planning to turn around and come back , they had to move fast to catch up with us , wearing our packs  --  and had difficulty doing so , since apparently the spectacle of two memsahibs strugglingwith baskets was so ridiculous that they were convulsed with laughter , which made them weak in the knees . " Buyhini , buyhIm ! "  --  " Little sister ! " cried Ang Nima piteously . After they got their baskets back , they were careful not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After that we went more slowly , wandering up a long series of stone steps , grateful when for an interval the trail turned into sandy soil , easy on the boots and feet . We passed a porter carrying a load of great square tin cans which banged rhythmically togetherwhen he walked and from which issued the sultry , heavy smell of oil . A startled water buffalo , tethered very tightly against the wall of his byre , looked up at the porter , aghast . A Gurung woman , dark and intense and wearing a flower-shaped stud in the side of her nose and a ring through her septum , seemed absolutely astonished at the looming height of Tina and stared at her openmoutheduntil we vanished from her sight . But some dark young men dressed in Western clothes showed off their sophistication by saying from the coolness of a porch : T HE G LAC I E R 91 " Do you have any medicine for headaches ? What is the time now ? I love you ! " not pausing for any answers , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we left them , " Thank you . Bye-bye ! " We were getting into Buddhist country now . Villages had prayer wheels set into their entry gates , and chortens , small and white , were set on windy corners of the trail . Prayer flags were stuck beneath the slats of fences and above the thatch of roofs , and the incenselike smell of burning juniper lingered above the villages . A boy picked large fresh mushrooms and placed them in his cap . Hand-axed boards as wide as king 's boards were drying in stacks held down by large white rocks . Tibetan traders coming from Manang rode by on horseback , shouting and laughing to one another ; almost everyone who passed us asked simply , " Manang ? " meaning were we heading in that direction , and we said just , " Manang . " A bevy of girls , beautifully dressed in a rainbow of colors , called out , " Chocolate , chocolate ? " and the boldest smiled in my face . But when Tina said gaily , " No chocolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off smiling as if they had never really wanted chocolate at all , did not in fact know what it was . Chocolate , medicine  --  perhaps they are worth a try , but in the end the Nepalese will settle quite happily for wild mint , dung plasters and the clouds beyond the mountains . Even the Brahman who stood so sadly by our luncheon cloth was not beset by greed  --  only by wonder , at the way in which life overtakes you and the limitations with which it rules your days . Sometimes I think that having too many choices is the curse of our civilization . I 've never felt so sorry for myself , or so bereft , as when I could clearly perceive the multitudinous tangle of paths that sliced the future . The Nepalese do n't have to think about those paths . They eat rice and lentils three times a day and they put on the same white sneakers with the same shiny bottoms every morning of their lives until the sneakers wear out , and then they step from them as easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind on the smooth stone steps . It is n't so much that92 T HE GLACIERsimplicity brings happiness as that it allows clear-sightedness . When you have only ten possessions , you have so much more freedom to see past them to something else ; and if you do n't have to take responsibility for the appearance of those possessions , all the better , because you do n't have to make your expression match theirs and your face has only two aspects , eagerness and repose . It 's like  --  when I am in Jackson and walk down the street . I keep my shoulders squared and sometimes mince when I walk , my eyes straight ahead , because I do n't want people to see me . But in Nepal when we first got to the hills I never felt like an egregious woman , a dancing girl , a clown , a whore . That 's what the mountainsdo for you anyway , of course , make you feel just like yourself , as simple as a candle flame , and there , even though the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's all right , because it 's the same for all of them , the path to the mountain has been laid out for the last six hundred years and the long brown legs that move in front of you as you climb it  --  purple cloth shot with gold thread falling loosely around the knees  --  are so firmly muscled because they have gone up and down that mountain path every day , twice a day , since they were old enough and strong enough to support their body and a copper pot of water as well . But there it is . In the West , the very first time you eat outside your house , you 're handed a menu that 's bigger than you are . No wonder you 're confused from that time forward , and walk down the street like a whole parade . Well , somehow , what with this and that , Tina and I missed lunch that day . Though everywhere we walked there were people walking with us , the villages were growing more widely scattered and as the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rock of a sheer cliff ; far below it , the green river wound across pebbles and clean white sand . There were lizards about , large lizards with yellow spots on their backs and bluish-purple legs , flushed as if by some strange alchemy . The butterflies were black and yellow , mottled , and flew with their wings sharply canted . Because of the growing steepness of the terrain , the trail nowTHE GLAC I ER 93followed a wandering course and we crossed the river several times as we got higher into the hills . One suspension bridge was very long and fairly rotten and Tina and I hurried across it along with several goats who were going the same way we were . The smell of the goats was so strong and the sound of the river so loud that we neither heard nor smelled the preparations for lunch there on the other side , and by the time we realized that lunch must be behind us , we had gained more than two thousand feet of elevation . Since neither of us had any desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the effect of the higher elevation or the effect of desperate hunger or simply the effect of walking with Tina , I do n't know , but as we walked , the day acquired a hallucinatory quality . Tina , because we had missed lunch , was sure that we were lost and asked everyone we passed whether we were on the road to Tal . Of course , everyone said , " Yes , yes , to Tal , " and finally Tina began to see the humor of this and when a very sophisticated and bored-looking Japanese man laden with cameras passed us , she said to him , " What 's the name of the place we 're going to , again ? " then went off into gales of laughter when he said politely , " Tal , " as did I , clutching my stomach to keep from falling down . Before long we were laughing at everything we saw : a little girl , saucy and showing off , who said " Hello , " then tripped over her plastic thong sandal ; several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking like moving trees to which had been attached small hands and feet and buttons ; three women in saris , twirling parasols , who looked so cool and clean and pleased with themselves that they might , as Tina said , have been going to a presidential inauguration . Finally , too weak to laugh anymore , I told Tina to walk in front of me so that I could look at her boots . " Perhaps , " I said , " they will have a sobering effect , " and even that seemed hysterically funny , so that by the time we got to Tal we were total wrecks and collapsed into the first teahouse we came to , where we ordered whatever was ready  --  which turned out to94 THE GLACIERbe dhalbat so heavily spiced it made our eyes water , and lemon tea so strong it looked and tasted like pee . Some cuckoo birds outside the teahouse were letting loose their songs with vigor . Tears running down her face , Tina said , " SomehowI keep taking the cuckoos ' message more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been sitting on the floor we would have fallen there , where we remained , in stitches , until a young girl wandered in . The girl was dressed in rags . Her face was dirty and her hair was matted and her eyes in her face were as bright and happy and alive as a pair of bluebirds winging in the sun . She had the dark curly hair of the Manangi and the light coloration and pink cheeks that make those people so lovely . She was electrifyingly beautiful , no more than seven years old , and with an absolute lack of selfconsciousnessshe walked over to where I was sitting cross-legged on a woven rug and began to touch my face and body , to play with the toggles on my wind pants and the Velcro on my sleeves . Although she had a bad wet cough that racked her periodically , she took no notice of it at all , simply went on learning how toggles worked and caressing my barrettes with wondering hands . She played with Tina too , but soon came back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . After a while the woman who ran the teahouse spoke to her sternly , ordering her to be gone . Disappointed , she turned toward the door , then looked back at me , her eyes so full of invitation that I told Tina I was taking a walk , and got up too , and followed the girl to the street , holding the hand that she proffered . When we came to the smallest and leakiest house in town , she drew me inside it , conspiratorial , and once my eyes got accustomed to the dimness I saw that it was full of children and one lean woman with pendulous breasts who sat at a loom , weaving . Baskets of unwashed , untreated wool sat on a chest with an old-fashioned iron padlock , above which hung a yak harness and a bundle of folded blankets . On the wooden bed next to the chest were pillows and more blankets and on the floor lay a beautiful thoughTHE GLACIER 95very worn Tibetan rug with orange and pink flowers in its center and a geometric scarlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire burned on the floor . Four thin straw mats lay beside it . Other than these fairly meager furnishings , the house contained only a huge sack of rice leaning against a pillar and a smaller basket of rice with a heavy cup inside it for a dipper . The girl , oblivious of her mother 's disapproving stare , led me over to the bed and sat me down upon it . The other children clustered around me , but she was always the one that sat nearest , and eventually she climbed right up into my lap . She did n't say a word , although she made small mewing sounds and although the other children , delighted at my unexpected advent , brought over several tattered schoolbooks , intent on teaching me in an hour their language and its splendid manifestations on the page . When I asked each child 's name he or she was ready enough with the answer , but when I asked my lapmate hers she just looked puzzled , and it was one of the other children who said , " Lyti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing to her chest . She nodded solemnly , then broke again into her enormous breathtaking smile and squirmed around on my lap . I 've never been what one might call maternal . Children tend to frighten me or disgust me or simply , often , bore me . But holding that little girl on my lap was like holding , not a child , but a lover . I leaned my face against her hair , breathing in the slightly acrid smell of her scalp , and rested my palms against her small round legs as if I was touching the source of all my happiness . For almost an hour we sat together quite contented while the other children came and went and Tina popped her head through the door to say hello and Ang Nima , who had finally realized that we had missed lunch , came running into Tal with our food in a small tin pail . I shared mine with the girl , not that she ate much . But colors and shapes and textures delighted her , and the challenge of determininghow things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time the main body of the expedition arrived in town , the96 T HE GLACIERgirl and I were inseparable and we went together to watch the tents being put up . When Tina 's duffel bag arrived , Tina took from it a set of watercolor paints , which she gave to the girl to play with , so after the dining tent was up we found some paper and went in there , and I taught her how to mix water with the paint and apply it to the paper . Entranced , she sat at the table until dinnertime , filling page after page of my notebook with bursts of color and lines and spirals , never repeating a pattern . What a bright kid she was ! And with a physical presence as powerful as any adult 's . But still she did not speak and it slowly began to dawn on me that she was set apart in some way from the other children  --  not just by that lack of speech but by her clothing also , because no matter how poor a family may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children in colors and deck their arms with bangles , and this girl was all in black , as thick and dusty as a tent . Yet she moved like an actress , wrapping the shawl around her head and peering out from under it , draping it across her shoulders like a piece of mink , trailing it from one finger like a queen on her way to an assignation . When Pasang came in to lay the table for dinner , I took her to my tent with me , and left her there with Tina while I went to find Tensing and ask him if he would look into her story . He did . He told me she was a Lyti . That was not , it seemed , her name , but a term used to describe people who were either deaf and dumb or retarded or sometimes both . He said that they were respected but that since they were nonproductive and different , people never felt quite at ease around them . He compared her to Changpa , one of the porters , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tina had befriended him , as she befriended everyone , and I had simply noticed him through her . Changpa was a small man , with a flat Mongolian nose and short spindly legs , but with an intelligent face and eyes that seemed to understand everything that went on around him . Tina did n't believe that he was deaf , simply that he was mute , and she talked with him as freely as with me . But he never made a sound ; thereTHE GLACIER 97was no rasping in his throat , no groan or strain , nothing at all that made you feel he would have liked to talk . It almost seemed that he had chosen silence , taken a vow as a monk might , and was no less wise because he could not share his wisdom . The Sherpas seemed uneasy around him , as if he were an unpredictable and therefore rather dangerous animal , and were quite content to leave him alone . Tensing smiled sadly  --  that bodhisattva smile of his  --  and went off to dig trenches around the campsites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing in her notebook , and the girl was watching her do it , one finger outstretched to the pen . I must have been quite mad , but I took her on my lap again and started to try and figure out what it would cost to buy her from her family and how I could adopt her and how long I would have to stay in Katmandu to get the paperwork straightened out . It was quite incredible to me that anyone could think her retarded , and I felt both angry at the stupidity of such blindness and also somehow grateful , as it would give me a good excuse to take her away from her home . My Lyti  --  she would never become like Changpa , not if I could help her find her voice . Never since I 'd met Nicholas had I felt such an instant attraction to another human being , and since Nicholas and Orion had died I 'd thought that I could never love again . After the avalanche , for months that merged like empty journeys , I 'd felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giver ; that whatever came from my hands had the vacuousness of air . An all-encompassing lethargy had ruled me , and though I 'd talked to people in the shop , packed gear and eaten my meals , I 'd felt as embarrassed by my own gratuitous existence as if I had been truly shaped of clay . Sometimes I even had resented Nicholas for not having left me a child , and sitting in Tal with a child on my lap , I felt closer to him than I had in ages , even before he died  --  felt as if I had found once more something I had lost long ago . That little girl , that Lyti . Of course , I did n't adopt her . Though I fell asleep talking with Tina of kidnap , when I woke up I simply told her goodbye . I left her the paint set and two of my barrettes , 98 T HE G L A C I ERbut I knew that even before we were out of sight the other children would have them and she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Lyti , with eyes and heart as full of life as a river , but no paint set and no words . After that ... nothing went really wrong . But nothing went really right either . I kept remembering the girl , a child without even a name , and every step I took away from her seemed somehowlike a betrayal . Not a betrayal of her , perhaps , but a betrayal of myself . TenWe were daily getting nearer to the mountain , moving up into higher , drier country , the rain shadow of the Himalayas where the land is stark and arid even after the monsoon . Everything was dull and thirsty ; at the bottom of the cirque on Annapurna Three the gravelly rock ran off in a sullen rubble and wisps of dirty cloud obscured parts of all its faces . I imagined myself made suddenly giant , striding to the mountain in two long steps and laying myself down as if on a coverlet , nestling my head on a pillow of rocks and leaving the earth for the sky . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray , and I stared at them jealously , coveting flight . I wanted to put myself right out of the accessible world . I wanted no responsibility and in truth no contact with the other members of the team . Although we had begun to get pretty friendly and to feel some real team spirit , after I left the Lyti behind , a lot of that feeling was gone . In fact , the other women began to irritate me exceedingly ; I saw embodied in them all the excesses and neuroses of Western civilization . Not always . But often enough so that it made me feel weird . Sometimes , I mean , I would like them  --  Taffy for her feminine charm , Dervla for her unfailing good spirits , Laurie for her dignity and skill . But other times ... it was n't just that at other times I would n't like them , or would be annoyed and turn it over and dislike Taffy for her excessive femininity , Dervla for her false good100 THE GLACIERhumor , Laurie for her standofFishness . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was relatively untouched . Rather , there were times when I 'd sit like a visitor from another planet , judging , analyzing , practically taking notes in a loose-leaf : thinking , for example , that the fact that Robin did n't want to climb anything but simple routes  --  nailing a wall straight up or doing a long undeviating jam crack  --  was clearly a sign that she was n't interested in climbing for its own sake , that she only wanted to set out on things that could be written down on a resume and instantly recognized as worthwhile ; in other words , that she was basically a coward and manipulative . And all the time I was thinking this , I was listening to her play the flute . Something felt very wrong to me , that I could sit in a group and be part of it and yet not be part of it , be a little person in a control station somewhere , making judgments , always judgments , unable to be with the others . And I had been looking forward so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were the mountains but also because they held the followers of the Buddha and in some inarticulate and illogical way I had hoped that without really trying , I too might become a genuine follower when I trod such well-worn paths . Of course , when I joined the sangha in Jackson Hole , it was n't because I knew I would be going to Nepal . Indeed , I somehow assumed that whatever passed for Buddhism in Jackson Hole could scarcely be the same substance , the same reality , as what one might experience in the mountains of its evolution ; yes , the mountains might be similar , the high thin air of elevation , but that was likely to be it , the only resemblance , though we all have a way of giving old names to new corruptions . I joined it after Nicholas was killed . While he lived , it never would have crossed my mind . But when he died I needed something , anything at all , that was different from what I 'd known with him . Besides , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could scarcely take a step without tripping over a Buddhist , and even among climbers who came into the shop itT HE G L A C I E R 101seemed to be the new concern , promising not answers but a way to make the space to look for them . In that , of course , it seemed to me to resemble climbing itself : both methods for abandoning the buzz , the noise , the badly constructed machinery of the mind , of journeying to a quiet place where everything you do is careful , not because such care will lead you somewhere but because it will let you be where you already are . I did n't think it could ever become my center , but I thought it might at least distract my mind , help me to cope with that echoing sense of bewilderment that I felt time and again after the avalanche , the sense of what in the name of heaven am I doing here at all ? And once I started sitting with the sangha I did see the connection more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path . Both bring a heightened state of concentrated awareness ; both are the way of a person facing death . We 've all been brought up to believe , somehow , that our lives have an ultimate purpose stamped out upon our birth and that each of our actions should be directed toward that end . Ask ten different people what that end might be called and you will get ten different answers , but very few people will say that the end is here and now , that life is just a finite series of disconnected moments with the best path through its changes being no set path at all . But when Mallory said that he wanted to climb Everest because it was there and the phrase went down in history as either evasive or inspired , he had in fact managed to reach out into the pool of truth which the Buddha also tapped and to lift out of it a coda for existence which , if embraced completely , could lead one finally to peace . The sangha was a small one . Eleven people on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oldest and most experienced member of the group . He had just that winter taken the bodhisattva vow  --  which affirms that you will , through compassion for others , surrenderthe possibility of your own enlightenment , since only when you are n't seeking it will you find it in the end . That 's nice , don't102 THE GLACIERyou think ? A beautiful turnaround on the idea of seek and you will find and a hell of a lot more logical if you ask me , since the one thing that is clear to anyone who has lived beyond the age of three is that whatever you find , you can be quite sure it 's not the thing you were looking for , and even when you climb a wall direct , the summit is never just where you thought it would be . So that instead of labeling everything in advance , on a set of neat and sticky white address tapes , and carrying them around with you in a basket , reaching into it constantly to affix a new definition to whatever it is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the impulse to break things into pieces , discrete enough to deal with one by one , and instead learn to be open , truly open , to the place where you are fixed . You see how well I managed . Well , at least I tried . The newfound bodhisattva was a tyrant . Not like Tensing at all , with his smile and his endless cheerful service ; not like Pasang , with his deep and limitless compassion ; Mitchell asked from each of us an absolute commitment to the Way , and when we were in sitting meditation his physical presence flowed over us like an admonition . Even an itch on my nose or ear would remain unscratched until it went away  --  although my ears seemed to itch all the time when I was sitting , and I got the illusion that it was because I was listening for something I could never quite hear , a very good example of the kind of self-entertainmentyou are supposed to learn to let go when you start to develop mindfulness . Sadly , there were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort involved in constantly bringing my attention back to my breath , the sound and feeling of my breath as it left my body , which is what sitting meditation begins with . As I sat there cross-legged on a cushion , breathing in front of an altar with seven little glass cups of water on it , it seemed ironic that I had to sit down on a pillow and cross my legs to pay attention to nothing but my breath , since half of every climb I 've been on , my breath became my world , and there 's nothing in life a climber knowsTHE GLACIER 103more intimately than the sound of air going into and out of his lungs . But try to tell that to Mitchell . He did n't climb . He sat . No , that is n't quite fair . He worked too , and lived in a house he had built himself , piece by slow piece , and the exactitude of every cut and the perfect placement of every nail in the staircase was an unmistakable demonstration of the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what he was thinking of was the saw , the hammer , the wood , and not life and death and bewilderment , whether he was going to get laid that evening or the fact that his father had spanked him unjustly as a child . He seemed in many ways like Nicholas 's diametric opposite , with an ego as strong but turned ten times more inward  --  a monk at heart , with all the fear of love that Nicholas never felt and the concomitant need for finding truth , which is the only conceivable alternative to indiscriminatepassion . Nicholas could never have become a Buddhist . And it was n't that his ego was overpoweringly strong , because that is not important in the end ; because that would in fact , if anything , have been an asset . The ego is all that you have , after all , and before you can try and transcend anything you have to have something to transcend . That 's where some people go wrong , right from the start , in thinking there are shortcuts to peace  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a kind of easy humility , which can be nothing but another word for a lack of self-respect , in order to gain enlightenment . They thick enlightenment is a kind of presentyou get , for being good , perhaps . They think that if they can simply never desire anything at all , they will never be destroyed by grief . But you do n't fall onto summits from the clouds . No , the reason Nicholas could never have been a Buddhist was that he could n't bear to think about the darkness at the heart of light . And yet he lived , somehow , much more closely to the mystery than I did , than most of us ever do . He felt with an intensity I have never seen surpassed , and one of the things that composed the pool of his deepest feelings was the enigma of the104 THE GLACIERjointure between himself and everything around him . For him , I am convinced , climbing really was a mystical experience . In climbing , as in nothing else , he simply trusted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions on the altar of otherness and was rewarded by an unsurpassable intuition of his own organicrelation to the world . That was what made him a great climber . And he was a great climber , greater than Ryan , certainly far greater than I. Without him , we would never have been what we were . Without him , I would never have really lived . Until after his death , though , I did n't see it thus . Because the flip side of his ability to become one with the rock was his absolute inability to become one with anything else . Into every encounter with a box , a room or a person he put all the intensity which worked so well for him in the mountains and did n't work at all for him anywhere else . Engines fell apart under his hands . Roomfulsof people disintegrated . He insisted on making all repairs , all confrontations , by himself . The result was that we spent twice the money and energy on maintenance that we otherwise would have , and that I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a few barroom brawls . Well , maybe that was his background . His father was a roughneck ; who knows the kinds of things he had to prove ? But at the time , I felt nothing but contempt for his inability to cope , not only with the world around him but with his own powerlessness to ultimately change that world . Now , of course , I do not feel contempt . Far from it . For I have come to realize that the inability to cope is in fact the most precious of gifts , because only when we can perceive and admit our own bewilderment can we begin to touch the mystery of life . Before Nicholas , I coped perhaps too well . And afterward  --  both from feeling , through the medium of my love , all the frustration that Nicholas was born to , and also through experiencing my own inability to help him , to change him , to have , ultimately , the slightest effect upon his pain  --  afterward I knew with every fiber of my being that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except to try and open yourself wideTHE GLACIER 105to the demon hosts around you , letting them pour through you like light , letting the absolute illogic of existence fill you . Because then  --  then , perhaps , you will intuit sometimes the oneness that was Nicholas 's reward when he leaned upon the point of his ice hammer , his crampons thrust into the thick blue ice , his Karrimor warm and heavy on his back , and his hair , curly and touched with fine white mist , falling softly around his face . He was brilliant when he led the first ascent of the Northeast Ridge of Mount Reconnaissance . Brilliant . You have no idea . That was always his reward and mine . Why on earth I should have thought that getting to Nepal would let me experience that feeling again  --  that here , if nowhere else , I would trip over revelation , intersect epiphany on the trail  --  I do n't know . But though I was in Buddhist country now , and climbing toward the mountain of my dreams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a greater sense of disconnectedness from the possibility of answers than I had felt for months , perhaps for years . Each hour that passed on the trail seemed to bring me closer to the brink of desperation . There was a quality of inattentionabout everything I did , as if I were only half a person and the other half had been left behind on the road somewhere , like a pair of worn-out sneakers , like the little girl in Tal . Yes . Yes . There was really something wrong , I see that now . Behind everything it lurked , like a hallucination , a cloud , a veil across my mind . I would start to speak and be unable to finish my sentence . I would look at Tina 's face and then my eyes would glaze , would wander , and whatever it was she was saying would go so totally unheard she might have been talking to the wind . I did imprudent things . I crossed log bridges with my waist belt fastened and my shoulder straps drawn tight . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty or thirty feet off the ground just as darkness fell . I climbed to the edge of a waterfall where a granite slab quivered over the void , and lay down flat to watch the water rushing by , losing myself in its motion , feeling that I should n't move , could n't move , until someone came along106 TH E GLACIERand called out my name . I kept setting up these arbitrary rules for myself as I went along , tests of courage not unlike the ones I had set myself as a child  --  if I do n't go over that wall without stopping once I 'm not going to get an A on my exam  --  perfectly ridiculous linkages of two quite disparate realities , giving myself rewards which were inappropriate to the achievements , if achievements was what in fact they were . So I started doing this again , but in a bigger way . I took risks which were essentially as unnecessary and therefore as foolish as unroping before you reach the end of a glacier  --  when there are , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite sufficient to kill you . It was as if there were a stone inside me , a stone that wanted to be shattered by a hammer big enough to fell a mountain , something hard and knotted , cold and glassy . And I went from place to place alternately forgetting about the stone , feeling its weight not at all , and letting it rule me completely , letting the desire for its fragmentation rule my life . It was n't really new to me , this sense of being split in half , this feeling that I was two people : the one who could get so high on sense itself that I thought I could float right out of my body and into the air above my head  --  and the one who hid inside like a rock waiting to be shattered . I had felt this , in fact , all my life ; I had felt it and gotten used to it  --  when I was ten years old , or twelve , or seventeen . I had felt it , really , even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it then or seen it for what it was . And then ? And then I had met Nicholas and the two halves had come together with a snap , since he was a hammer big enough to shatter that rock and gather the gravel that was left and with it pave the way to anywhere . He made me whole  --  and when he died , I thought that the incongruitiesof my existence were because he had died , because he had been killed  --  not because he was gone . But now ... now I was beginning to feel that maybe there is something to this business of your other half . Because that wholeness had to do with moTHEGLACIER 107ments  --  moments when I knew what I 'd been born for . When- ever I watched Nicholas breathe , or climb , or sensed him behind me on the rope , then that was the reason I had , by a series of miracles , escaped death when I fell down Teepee 's Glacier and lost my ice ax , and stopped only twenty feet above the rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my horse tightly around a hundred barrels set in sawdust , my thighs wet with sweat and sticking to the saddle ; it was the reason I 'd opened a jar of kosher pickles and spilled all the juice on the floor ; the reason I 'd been called to the principal 's office by mistake on the day I 'd finally dared to wear sneakers to school ; for that moment , I had never been able to hold a tune and had slept in Orion 's arms . No matter how murky the matter had been before and was to be again , at that moment it was always plain why I was alive . It was to watch Nicholas and let out the rope while he climbed . He was so beautiful , really . So pink and so brown , so alive . When he set his hand on the edge of the table as he stood beside it  --  not conscious of his hand and the small cup it formed on the wood  --  the veins just under his skin filled with blood and became rounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlamp and the elastic strap frayed at one edge clamped his balaclava to his , , head , his face was as smooth as a tree stripped of bark . Sometimes he would sit by the trail , his shoulder straps loosened , his bright- orange wind pants stretched taut across the muscles of his legs , and spread a map across his lap to study it , not even using his finger to trace our route . And when he climbed , he moved from hold to hold as fluidly as a branch bends , and his fingertips  --  even just two of them , the very top joints  --  would rest on a shard of rock as if it were ineluctable , would be drawn to the stone as confidently as the roots of a ginkgo seek water . And so I started dreaming . I had had dreams about death , lots of dreams , right after Nicholas and Ryan died , but they were simple in a way : I 'd be standing looking down at a black river just entering a cave , aware that though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obsidian or ice , it was actually rushing by as fast as bombers and I was dizzy and tilting toward the edge . Well , now I started having dreams again , and they were n't simple , though they scared the hell out of me , and I would wake in a cold sweat and be unable to sleep again for hours . There was one that I remember clearly . I had it just below the town of Braga . We were camped on the plain there , exposed as an army before a siege wall . The city loomed above us like a medieval fortress , its crazy pueblo houses leaning against the cliff as precariously as the log ladders used to reach them . The paths leading into the town were as slick and steep as logs across a stream and the rubbled rock slope that marks its base seemed like a runoff from the fortress itself , the slow accumulation of ages of decay . A policeman lived in Braga , a policeman singularly well matched to the bleakness of the town . His big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party of nineteen Germans and all their porters who were trying to slip quietly and carefully up the Nar valley into Tibet . Two hundred people , quieter than mice , and he stopped them , single-handed . But he was university educated and spoke good English and was terribly hungry for conversation . Except during the trekking/mountaineering season , he said , the snow is up to your chest in Braga and only old people , blind people and idiots remain there . He served us good coffee in filthy glasses which he wiped apologetically with filthy fingers and showed us a book in which he had all the climbers who passed sign . He had noted the deaths opposite their names , in a beautiful archaic hand . " Died , " he said , " on expedition . That is the world beyond these walls . " Tina and I had visited the Buddhist gompa just after we met that policeman . The monk who unlocked the big steel padlock was dressed in dirty robes , yellow and maroon , and he practically tapped his foot while we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be very holy indeed if I put my offering on the altar along with the rice and the butter , rather than in theTHE GLACIER 109locked strongbox by the door  --  to which , evidently , he had not been given a key and into which , therefore , it would be a great deal more difficult for him to get his hands . Well , I put ten rupees in the strongbox when we left , watched by the great smiling Buddha that lurked in the shadows , and that night I had the dream . There was a great locked warehouse in my dream , a dim buildingfull of objects , all of them out of my past . Old toys were pinned to the walls like bats , worn-out climbing shoes sat in long rows on benches against the walls , sleeping bags were slung in hammocks from the ceiling like Malaysian paper kites . A policemanstood by the door to the warehouse , a policeman who looked and sounded like Orion , and after a time he let me in  --  unlocking the big wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face full of foreboding . He warned me not to stay too long . He warned me not to take anything out of the hall . So I went in . I felt a great affection for the warehouse , a love for the objects of my past , mixed with a great , half-hidden fear  --  a fear of the blackness , the cobwebs in the corners , the places I could n't quite see clearly . As I was leaving , I noticed on the floor a blue-black seed . Of all the objects in the warehouse , it was the only one I could n't remember having seen before , and it looked so small and innocent , just carelessly left behind , that I picked it up and put it in my pocket , then bowed once and went out . Ryan still stood by the doorway . He locked the door behind me and then said : " I 'm glad you did n't bring anything out . I could n't warn you before . " His voice dropped and he added in a whisper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark . " I tried to put my hand in my pocket and get the seed and fling it away , but I could n't find it , it had slipped through a hole or changed its shape , so I started running , running through long cobbled streets full of stones . But the seed pursued me and transformeditself , changing first into a bat , then into a gargoyle , and110 T HE G L A C I E Rfinally into an old , old woman dressed in black , who flung herself onto my back , wrapped her arms tightly around my throat and whispered , " I am the seed , the blue-black seed , the seed that grows in the dark . " I woke up trembling and crying . Tina was sound asleep . A little drop of spit had run from the corner of her mouth onto her pillow , and her hair was soft across her head . She looked so young , so handsome , so gentle and unmarred , that I wanted to cling to her tightly and beg her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first started living together , perhaps only two or three weeks after we moved into the trailer in Jackson , I had had a nightmare and woken up crying out in terror , and without even fully waking he had turned to me and clutched me as tightly as a python and said in a voice heavy with sleep , " It 's all right , love . It 's only the morning . " It 's all right , love . It 's only the morning . A strange thing to say , meaningless in itself , but with the deeper meaning that is given to the messages of the night . As if , left to my own devices , unloved , unprotected by Nicholas and his arms , I would naturally misinterpret the meaning of the morning itself , would see it for something other than what it was , granting to the morning , the chance of a new beginning , all the menace one normally attributesto the night  --  as if , in the deep truth of his sleep , he knew that the thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that all nightmares , once they were done , had power only if you let them rule tomorrow . So I lay there and looked at Tina in the moonlight , touched her hair and moved a tendril on the pillow and kept crying . Not because I had lost Nicholas ; but because when he had died I was getting ready to leave him , because when he was killed I was already convinced that all was over between us . Now that seemed like nothing but psychosis . In truth , I had loved him so much that it still hurt , so much that it would hurt forever , and all my mornings would be full of the shadow of the past since I would never have the chance to go back and love him as he died . BecauseT HE G L A C I E R IIIwhen the avalanche was over , it was Ryan I found first . There was snow in his mouth and nostrils and I could n't find a heartbeat . But he 'd been close to the surface and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I worked on him . An hour , two ? Maybe more . I forgot about Nicholas as if he had never been . ElevenMemories are peculiar . They can be so recalcitrant sometimes , when you 're trying to line them up . You ca n't approach them as if you were unrolling flypaper or something , twisting it carefully as it comes out of the tube , so sticky you might as well cut your hair off if it ever brushes your head . You think the past is there , all fixed and stable , but it 's really chock-full of surprises and endlessly susceptible to change . Once , in the foothills of the Wind River Mountains , Ryan and I came across a house that had been abandoned and had tumbled down , the furniture still inside it , the plates that survived the crash intact . We spent a few hours exploring the wreckage and , perched on a rotten beam , eating tuna fish sandwiches . But when a year later we went back to look for the place again we could n't find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . It was gone as if it had never been . And this so fascinated Orion  --  the way in which the present swallows up the past  --  that he really convinced himself that we had made up the house between us and that we had the power to create and destroy our world . When we were older , stuck on a belay ledge one night with nothing but bivy sacks between us and the snow , he told me he believed that nothing and no one in the world can hurt you : you can only , if you want to , choose to be hurt . There was a mountain sheep bleating somewhere below us , a sheep that was also stuck on a ledge . We listened to the sheep for a whileT H E G L A C I E R 113and then he said that anyone could go back through the leaves of his own past and choose not to be hurt by the things that had already hurt him : not just go on , not just put yourself in a position where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but remake your past in a fundamental way , and open yourself ever wider . I could n't believe that then . I said there were limits to any strength , that your life is something you accumulate , your baggage , something you carry around . There 's no left-luggage room where you can deposit it forever , there 's no unloading avalanche , no forgetting short of death . But maybe Nicholas never hurt me , and I , through ignorance , only hurt myself . Sometimes I really believe that if Nicholas had appreciated me from the first , I never would have stayed with him . He used to say , you see , that all women are alike . So sometimes  --  now , only now , it 's all now , always now  --  I wonder whether that was n't why I stayed with him all those years : because ultimately I was stubborn enough to want above all else to prove to him that all women are not alike , not in the sense that he meant . That there was one woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , he mastered me . In the end , I had no choices left ; my emotions were no longer under my control . But I wonder if I can really change that now . Of course , I was just as responsible as he was for the patterns of our life together  --  but how to sort out where my own mistakes were made ? Probablyin thinking I was somehow good by virtue of the fact that I wanted to help him  --  when perhaps , without such meddling on my part , he would have coped much more adequately than he did with the vicissitudes of life . But the corollary of his impatience was the fact that he always seemed to respond to my touch too late . If he was , for some reason , sunk in depression and I tried to urge him out of it by every suggestion and encouragement I could command , he would be obdurate , hopeless , until I was quite wrung dry and had accepted that this time too there would be no happiness at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be feeling that anyone who placed such a burden of failure on me114 T HE G LAC I E R ( the failure , that is , of my own ability to help him ) was someone I would just as soon be rid of  --  then and only then would he suddenly emerge from behind the walls of his dejection and say , " O.K. , you 're right , let 's do it , shall we ? " in a tone that was suddenly bright , and I would be left with the choice of either saying , " Forget it , jocko , it 's too late now , " which would in effect make me a hypocrite since the burden of my message to him the whole time had been essentially that it was never too late for anything ; or against all my instincts wresting from myself a cheery " Fine , great , let 's go , " when I no longer felt in the least like going wherever it was or anywhere else , but away , as all the pleasure of anticipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erected and all the pleasure of helping him had been destroyed by that immeasurable and seemingly endless delay between the time when I had stopped hoping he would respond and the time when he finally did . So maybe that was where my mistakes were made . By trying always to fling myself between him and the realities he did n't want to face , I gave him a crutch he could not refuse , a crutch that partly crippled him . Sometimes I think it 's power , all power , in the end . And I wonder now whether I was not as manipulative as the worst women of my fantasy world , wanting him to behave as I wanted him to behave , in fact , and stopping at nothing to bring about that end . Although I thought I was never physically afraid of him , the threat of force always latent within him may have made me try and defuse it by verbal games that I believed were love . The flip side of unrestrained violence is controlled violence , after all , and the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of warfare . Still , I never wanted to hurt him . I merely wanted to win . And I guess what kept me with him was the fact that I could win  --  sometimes , in various ways . And also the fact that I could never know when this would happen . There was an element of chance in all our undertakings which kept me interested . The gambler in me , the climber who takes unnecessary risks , wasT HE G LAC I E R 115fascinated by the unpredictability of the outcomes of our struggles . I remember one fight we had . It was slow in building , like most of our conflicts . We 'd been talking about selling the shop . We 'd only owned it for a year and it was becoming pretty clear to us that neither of us wanted to be a businessman . We did n't have the aptitude . We did n't have the self-image . We would have been better off working in the coal mines all winter and climbing from spring to fall . So we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ears in debt and the winter had n't been good . We 'd moved to a little house in Jackson , but we did n't see how we could manage to get the time off to climb the Grand , much less go to Patagonia , as we wanted . I had been urging Nicholas to relax ; whether we sold the shop or not , Ryan would help with cash for South America . Nicholas was having his biannual go at rejecting this ; he was n't about to take charity , he was n't the kind who lived off other people . He would , in fact , stay at the shop all summer if it killed him . I see now that I should probably have let him do just that . But though the instinct for independence is , in general , one that I admire , in this case it interfered too radically with my own wishes for me to countenance it . Rather than encouraging him to make it on his own , to make himself independent of financial charity , I maintained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rooted in false pride , a macho disdain for the fruits of love . I was very persuasive . I was , even after four years with him , unthinking enough about the way Nicholas worked to fear that he would actually stick to his guns and let Ryan and me go off alone . And I wanted him along , more than anything in the world . As a climbing team the three of us could n't be beat . In fact , our moments on the rope were the still points of peace around which our relationship revolved . I did n't want to find out what would happen if we lost them . So there was this fundamental tension in our life . Had it happenedtwo years later , it would have been increased by my own116 T HE G L A C I E Rirritation at the knowledge that in the end , of course , Nicholas would give in and go . I would have perceived as hypocrisy the stand for independence . But at the time the tension stemmed simply from my own fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classic by-product of that , my underlying sense that if such were the case , he could not really love me ) and from his inability to reconcile his image of a real man as one who " pulled his own weight " with his desperate desire to climb . Well , that was the background . After a week of this back-andforth , in the dreariest days of late winter , one Sunday the weather dawned beautifully sunny and there were spring smells in the air  --  sagebrush and jack pine , water running over rocks , the steamy odor of melting snow  --  so we decided to go for a ski . You know how you feel in the springtime : that nothing on earth can stop you now , when everything around you is sensuous , touchable , desirable once more . It 's like coming down from the alpine zone , from a tent in a storm , and on smelling the flowers , just having to run , with big squishy leaps in the air , from sheer joy at having your senses back once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We set off for a new place , a road that a friend had told us about , a long winding road which turned into a trail above Togwotee Pass , where it went over the rim of the Absarokas and down into a bowl on the other side . We did n't have a map . But since it was spring and Sunday , we had absolute faith when we began that we would find the place and that it would be quite untrodden . A white place that waited for marking . How could we miss it ? We would find it right away . Of course , we did not . The roads off Togwotee Pass are a maze and no one 's directions are ever exact . We set off up one road , which turned out to be a skid trail , nothing more . So we skied back to the truck , took off our skis and drove on until we located another road , one we were sure  --  with the grateful conviction of uncertainty  --  resembled in every particular the one we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also . At that point we should , of course , have left and gone elsewhere . It wasT HE G LAC I E R 117still early in the morning and there were plenty of places to ski . But we tried once again , in that fatalistic way we had , each of us filled with a sudden foreboding that we were not going to enjoy the day after all and each of us doing our best to ignore it . Halfway up the third road , which I had been excitedly maintaining was the proper one at last , I began to be doubtful . I commented that it looked awfully new . Somewhat sardonically , Nicholas agreed that it did look awfully new . Our skis had started to stick a bit and I was getting hot and frustrated . Stubbornly wanting to wrest enjoyment from the day and from the woods which had so often given me peace , I suggested that we simply go on , bushwhack up to the teeth of the ridge and ski along it until we found the trail . Nicholas said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bushes " and told me we should call it a day . He then went off into the woods to take a shit and while he squatted in the snow we bickered . I told him I was n't about to go back to Jackson , that we 'd been stuck there long enough . He told me it was my fault we were stuck there  --  that he had never wanted to buy the shop in the first place . There was an element of truth to this ; he had been terrified of getting into debt , even to my brother . But that only made me more irritated , and through the lens of my present frustration it appeared to me that far from being my fault that we had done less mountaineering since we bought the shop , it was his fault that we had let it tie us down . Nicholas might want to go back , resign himself to mediocrity  --  play , in fact , the dying martyr on the cross  --  but I was damned if I was going to give in so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started back for the truck , I was determined to ski all day if it killed me . Nicholas was reluctant even to speak to me , but we managed to argue about who should get the truck and who should hitchhike back to town as we glided down the wet snow with the sounds of woodpeckers and chickadees quivering around us and the mournful groaning of some cattle coming from the road below . I do n't know why it was , but Nicholas always had a horror of118 T HE G LAC I E Rtrespassing on private property . He would go to great lengths to circumnavigate any bit of woods that looked likely to belong to someone , or where there was any evidence of human habitation . I suppose in a way it 's not so odd ; it tied in with his underlying fear of being caught out somehow , of being found in a position where he was required to defend himself from the inquisitiveness or demands of other human beings . I suppose in some ways he had a child 's paranoia of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish than to be on someone else 's land , especially to a man who did not want to believe in the right to private ownership of land and yet desired to have whole mountain ranges to himself ? There was a time when it made him nervous that I plucked a stick to play with from the top of a barbed-wire fence . He said that if the owners of the fence saw me , they might think I was stealing . " Stealing ? A stick ? " I asked . When we got back to the truck I took the wheel . We both refused to hitchhike and I refused to go back home , maintaining that our original agreement was to spend the day , that this was incontrovertibly proved by the fact that we had brought a lunch , and that I intended to hold to our agreement . Nicholas closed himself off at this as definitively as someone shutting down a faucet . This was one of my most effective tactics  --  to hold him at his word  --  since he believed that a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do even though his mercurial nature made it almost impossible for him to know what he wanted long enough in advance to gain much happiness that way . But the longer I used it as a tactic , the less satisfaction I got from it , as he simply became less and less willing to commit himself to anything until the last possible instant , and I picked up this trait from him by a kind of osmosis and as a form of self-protection , so neither of us had any security about our future plans . Anyway , having shut Nicholas off , I had n't the strength to turn him back on , though once he had withdrawn into the boundaries of his body I sawT H E G L A C I E R 119instantly that this was the last thing I had wanted to have happen and I longed to pick him up and slam him against a wall , move him bodily from where he sat to somewhere else ; anything to disturb his stiff self-righteousness . Perhaps that 's why I tried to find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found it I would not enjoy my ski , nor would I be able to relax , with Nicholas waiting in the truck . But I had more of a chance of stirring him up if I pursued the road and I could not let it end without at least an apparent victory for myself  --  me skiing , Nicholas waiting  --  even when such an outcome would give me no pleasure and would give Nicholas the pleasure of putting me in the wrong by not considering his changed feelings about our plans . I did n't intend to park on private property . I had no idea that any of the land near Togwotee Pass was posted . The fourth road had been plowed and I drove up it with an utter disregard for the question of how I was going to get out ; I assumed there must be somewhere to turn a truck around . Two hundred yards up the road we passed the sign : " Private Property . No Hunting or Fishing . " It was nailed to a tree by a particularly steep bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels were about to start spinning , Nicholas barked that we were on private property and to let him out of the truck at once . Well , I could n't possibly have stopped . I would have lost all momentum and had to back down the road again . So I kept going , imagining it must be apparent even to Nicholas that I was heading for a flatter stretch of road before I stopped . It was not . With the truck still moving , he wrenched open the door , threw out his rucksack ( with all the food ) and leaped after it . Out of the corner of my eye I could see him stumble and fall and then pick himself up again and take off , almost running , for the roadhead . The door of the passenger seat was swinging open . It slammed suddenly with the movement of the car and , distracted , I let up on the gas . My back tires spun wildly on the snow . Backing down the road again was hell . There were high snowbankson either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lecture on what to do in the event of a crash . The lecture had been perfunctory enough that it took no great intellect to estimate their chances of survival if they did crash on a night like this . Ryan hated flying . He had once been a marine second lieutenant , and his active career had ended after only three months when his platoon 's helicopter had crashed on Crete during a NATO exercise . He had injured his back , nearly been crippled for life , and ever since regarded flying as something to be avoided . The COD , he thought , was bouncing more down than up . It probably meant they were close to the Kennedy . The alternative did not bear thinking about . They were only ninety minutes out of Oceana Naval Air Station at Virginia Beach . It felt like a month , and Ryan swore to himself that he 'd never be afraid on a civilian airliner again . The nose dropped about twenty degrees , and the aircraft seemed to be flying right at something . They were landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He remembered a study conducted during the Vietnam War in which carrier pilots had been fitted with portable electrocardiographsto monitor stress , and it had surprised a lot of people that the most stressful time for carrier pilots was n't while they were being shot at  --  it was while they were landing , particularly at night . Christ , you 're full of happy thoughts ! Ryan told himself . He closed his eyes . One way or another , it would be over in a few seconds . The deck was slick with rain and heaving up and down , a black hole surrounded by perimeter lights . The carrier landing was a controlled crash . Massive landing gear struts and shock absorbers were needed to lessen the bone-crushing impact . The aircraft surged forward only to be jerked to a halt by the arresting wire . They were down . They were safe . Probably . After a moment 's pause , the COD began moving forward again . Ryan heard some odd noises as the plane taxied and realized that they came from the wings folding up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aircraft whose wings were supposed to collapse . It was , he decided , just as well . The plane finally stopped moving , and the rear hatch opened . Ryan flipped off his seatbelts and stood rapidly , banging his head on the low ceiling . He did n't wait for Davenport . With his canvas bag clutched to his chest he darted out of the rear of the aircraft . He looked around , and was pointed to the Kennedy 's island structure by a yellowshirteddeck crewman . The rain was falling heavily , and he felt rather than saw that the carrier was indeed moving on the fifteen-foot seas . He ran towards an open , lighted hatch fifty feet away . He had to wait for Davenport to catch up . The admiral did n't run . He walked with a precise thirty-inch step , dignified as a flag officer should be , and Ryan decided that he was probably annoyed that his semisecret arrival prohibited thep101usual ceremony of bosun 's pipes and side boys . There was a marine standing inside the hatch , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tie , and snow-white pistol belt . He saluted , welcoming both aboard . " Corporal , I want to see Admiral Painter . " " The admiral 's in flag quarters , sir . Do you require escort ? " " No , son , I used to command this ship . Come along , Jack . " Ryan got to carry both bags . " Gawd , sir , you actually used to do this for a living ? " Ryan asked . " Night carrier landings ? Sure , I 've done a couple of hundred . What 's the big deal ? " Davenport seemed surprised at Ryan 's awe . Jack was sure it was an act . The inside of the Kennedy was much like the interior of the USS Guam , the helicopter assault ship Ryan had been assigned to during his brief military career . It was the usual navy maze of steel bulkheads and pipes , everything painted the same shade of cave-gray . The pipes had some colored bands and stenciled acronyms which probably meant something to the men who ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been neolithic cave paintings . Davenport led him through a corridor , around a corner , down a " ladder " made entirely of steel and so steep he almost lost his balance , down another passageway , and around another corner . By this time Ryan was thoroughly lost . They came to a door with a marine stationed in front . The sergeant saluted perfectly , and opened the door for them . Ryan followed Davenport in  --  and was amazed . Flag quarters on the USS Kennedy might have been transported as a block from a Beacon Hill mansion . To his right was a wall-sized mural large enough to dominate a big living room . A half-dozen oils , one of them a portrait of the ship 's namesake , President John Fitzgerald Kennedy , dotted the other walls , themselves covered with expensive-looking paneling . The deck was covered in thick crimson wool , and the furniture was pure civilian , French provincial , oak and brocade . One could almost imagine they were not aboard a ship at all , except that the ceiling  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all painted gray . It was a decidedly odd contrast to the rest of the room . " Hi ya , Charlie ! " Rear Admiral Joshua Painter emerged from the next room , drying his hands with a towel . " How was it coming in ? " " Little rocky , " Davenport allowed , shaking hands . " This is Jack Ryan . " Ryan had never met Painter but knew him by reputation . A Phantom pilot during the Vietnam War , he had written a book , Paddystrikes , on the conduct of the air campaigns . It had been a truthful book , not the sortp102of thing that wins friends . He was a small , feisty man who could not have weighed more than a hundred thirty pounds . He was also a gifted tacticianand a man of puritanical integrity . " One of yours , Charlie ? " " No , Admiral , I work for James Greer . I am not a naval officer . Please accept my apologies . I do n't like pretending to be what I 'm not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew a frown . " Oh ? Well , I suppose that means you 're going to tell me what Ivan 's up to . Good , I hope to hell somebody knows . First time on a carrier ? How did you like the flight in ? " " It might be a good way to interrogate prisoners of war , " Ryan said as offhandedly as he could . The two flag officers had a good laugh at his expense , and Painter called for some food to be sent in . The double doors to the passageway opened several minutes later and a pair of stewards  --  " mess management specialists "  --  came in , one bearinga tray of food , the other two pots of coffee . The three men were served in a style appropriate to their rank . The food , served on silvertrimmedplates , was simple but appetizing to Ryan , who had n't eaten in twelve hours . He dished cole slaw and potato salad onto his plate and selected a pair of corned-beef-on-ryes . " Thank you . That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attention before leaving . " Okay , let 's get down to business . " Ryan gulped down half a sandwich . " Admiral , this information is only twenty hours old . " He took the briefing folders from his bag and handed them around . His delivery took twenty minutes , during which he managed to consume the two sandwiches and a goodly portion of his cole slaw and spill coffee on his hand-written notes . The two flag officers were a perfect audience , not interrupting once , only darting a few disbelieving looks at him . " God Almighty , " Painter said when Ryan finished . Davenport just stared poker-faced as he contemplated the possibility of examing a Soviet missile sub from the inside . Jack decided he 'd be a formidable opponent over cards . Painter went on , " Do you really believe this ? " " Yes , sir , I do . " Ryan poured himself another cup of coffee . He would have preferred a beer to go with his corned beef . It had n't been bad at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to find in London . Painter leaned back and looked at Davenport . " Charlie , you tell Greer to teach this lad a few lessons  --  like how a bureaucrat ai n't supposedto stick his neck this far out on the block . Do n't you think this is a little far-fetched ? " " Josh , Ryan here 's the guy who did the report last June on Soviet missile-sub patrol patterns . "  | " Oh ? That was a nice piece of work . It confirmed something I 've been saying for two or three years . " Painter rose and walked to the corner to look out at the stormy sea . " So , what are we supposed to do about all this ? " " The exact details of the operation have not been determined . What I expect is that you will be directed to locate Red October and attempt to establish communications with her skipper . After that ? We 'll have to figure a way to get her to a safe place . You see , the president does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get her  --  if we get her . " " What ? " Painter spun around and spoke a tenth of a second before Davenport did . Ryan explained for several minutes . " Dear God above ! You give me one impossible task , then you tell me that if we succeed in it , we got ta give the goddamned thing back to them ! " " Admiral , my recommendation  --  the president asked me for one  --  was that we keep the submarine . For what it 's worth , the Joint Chiefs are on your side , too , along with the CIA . As it is , though , if the crewmen want to go back home , we have to send them back , and then the Soviets will know we have the boat for sure . As a practical matter , I can see the other side 's point . The vessel is worth a pile of money , and it is their property . And how would we hide a 30,000-ton submarine ? " " You hide a submarine by sinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to do that , you know . Their property ! ' We 're not talking about a damned passenger liner . That 's something designed to kill people  --  our people ! " " Admiral , I am on your side , " Ryan said quietly . " Sir , you said we 've given you an impossible task . Why ? " " Ryan , finding a boomer that does not want to be found is not the easiest thing in the world . We practice against our own . We damned near always fail , and you say this one 's already passed all the northeast SOSUS lines . The Atlantic 's a rather large ocean , and a missile sub 's noise footprint is very small . " " Yes , sir . " Ryan noted to himself that he might have been overly optimistic about their chances for success . " What sort of shape are you in , Josh ? " Davenport asked . " Pretty good , really . The exercise we just ran , NIFTY DOLPHIN , worked out all right . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dallas raised some hell on the other side . My ASW crews are functioning very well . What sort of help are we getting ? " " When I left the Pentagon , the CNO was checking the availability of P-3s out on the Pacific , so you 'll probably be seeing more of those . Everything that 'll move is putting to sea . You 're the only carrier , so you 've got overall tactical command , right ? Come on , Josh , you 're our best ASW operator . "  |p104Painter  poured some coffee for himself . " Okay , we have one carrier deck . America and Nimitz are still a good week away . Ryan , you said you 're flying out to Invincible . We get her , too , right ? " " The president was working on that . Want her ? " " Sure . Admiral White has a good nose for ASW , and his boys really lucked out during DOLPHIN . They killed two of our attack boats , and Vince Gallery was some kind of pissed about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That would give us two decks instead of one . I wonder if we can get some more S-3s ? " Painter referred to the Lockheed Vikings , **25;12051;TOOLONG aircraft . " Why ? " Davenport asked . " I can transfer my F-18s to shore , and that 'll give us room for twenty more Vikings . I do n't like losing the striking power , but what we 're going to need is more ASW muscle . That means more S-3s . Jack , you know that if you 're wrong , that Russkie surface force is going to be a handful to deal with . You know how many surface-to-surface missiles they 're packing ? " " No , sir . " Ryan was certain it was too many . " We 're one carrier , and that makes us their primary target . If they start shooting at us , it 'll get awful lonesome  --  then it 'll get awful exciting . " The phone rang . " Painter here . . . Yes . Thank you . Well , Invinciblejust turned around . Good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cans . The rest of the escorts and the three attack subs are still heading home . " He frowned . " I ca n't really fault them for that . That means we have to give them some escorts , but it 's a good trade . I want that flight deck . " " Can we chopper Jack out to her ? " Ryan wondered if Davenport knew what the president had ordered him to do . The admiral seemed interested in getting him off the Kennedy . Painter shook his head . " Too far for a chopper . Maybe they can send a Harrier back for him . " " The Harrier 's a fighter , sir , " Ryan commented . " They have an experimental two-seat version set up for ASW patrolling . It 's supposed to work reasonably well outside their helo perimeter . That 's how they bagged one of our attack boats , caught her napping . " Painter finished off the last of his coffee . " Okay , gentlemen , let 's get ourselves down to ASW control and try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CINCLANT will want to hear what I have in mind . I suppose I 'd better decide for myself . We 'll also call Invincible and have them send a bird back to ferry you out , Ryan . " Ryan followed the two admirals out of the room . He spent two hours watching Painter move ships around the ocean like a chess master with his pieces.  |p105The  USS DallasBart Mancuso had been on duty in the attack center for more than twenty hours . Only a few hours of sleep separated this stretch from the previous one . He had been eating sandwiches and drinking coffee , and two cups of soup had been thrown in by his cooks for variety 's sake . He examined his latest cup of freeze-dried without affection . " Cap'n ? " He turned . It was Roger Thompson , his sonar officer . " Yes , what is it ? " Mancuso pulled himself away from the tactical display that had occupied his attention for several days . Thompson was standing at the rear of the compartment . Jones was standing beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine . " Sir , Jonesy has something I think you ought to look at . " Mancuso did n't want to be bothered  --  extended time on duty always taxed his patience . But Jones looked eager and excited . " Okay , come on over to the chart table . " The Dallas ' chart table was a new gadget wired into the BC-10 and projected onto a TV-type glass screen four feet square . The display moved as the Dallas moved . This made paper charts obsolete , though they were kept anyway . Charts ca n't break . " Thanks , Skipper , " Jones said , more humbly than usual . " I know you 're kinda busy , but I think I got something here . That anomalous contact we had the other day 's been bothering me . I had to leave it after the ruckus the other Russkie subs kicked up , but I was able to come back to it three times to make sure it was still there . The fourth time it was gone , faded out . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punch up our course track for back then on this baby , sir ? " The chart table was interfaced through the BC-10 into the ship 's inertial navigation system , SINS . Mancuso punched the command in himself . It was getting so that you could n't flush the head without a computer command . . . The Dallas ' course track showed up as a convolutedred line , with tick marks displayed at fifteen-minute intervals . " Great ! " Jones commented . " I 've never seen it do that before . That 's all right . Okay . " Jones pulled a handful of pencils from his back pocket . " Now , I got the contact first at 0915 or so , and the bearing was about two-six-nine . " He set a pencil down , eraser at Dallas ' position , point directed west towards the target . " Then at 0930 it was bearing two-sixzero . At 0948 , it was two-five-zero . There 's some error built into these , Cap'n . It was a tough signal to lock in on , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got all this other activity , and I had to go after them , but I came back to it about 1000 , and the bearing was two-fourtwo . " Jones set down another pencil on the due-east line traced when thep106Dallas had moved away from the Icelandic coast . " At 1015 it was twothree-four , and at 1030 it was two-two-seven . These last two are shaky , sir . The signal was real faint , and I did n't have a very good lock on it . " Jones looked up . He appeared nervous . " So far , so good . Relax , Jonesy . Light up if you want . " " Thanks , Cap'n . " Jones fished out a cigarette and lit it with a butane lighter . He had never approached the captain quite this way . He knew Mancuso to be a tolerant , easygoing commander  --  if you had something to say . He was not a man who liked his time wasted , and it was sure as hell he would n't want it wasted now . " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too far away from us , right ? I mean , he had to be between us and Iceland . So let 's say he was about halfway between . That gives him a course about like this . " Jones set down some more pencils . " Hold it , Jonesy . Where does the course come from ? " " Oh , yeah . " Jones flipped open his clipboard . " Yesterday morning , night , whatever it was , after I got off watch , it started bothering me , so I used the move we made offshore as a baseline to do a little course track for him . I know how , Skipper . I read the manual . It 's easy , just like we used to do at Cal Tech to chart star motion . I took an astronomy course in my freshman year . " Mancuso stifled a groan . It was the first time he had ever heard this called easy , but on looking at Jones ' figures and diagrams , it appeared that he had done it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Packard scientific calculator from his pocket and what looked like a National Geographic map liberally coated with pencil marks and scribblings . " You want to check my figures , sir ? " " We will , but I 'll trust you for now . What 's the map ? " " Skipper , I know it 's against the rules an ' all , but I keep this as a personal record of the tracks the bad guys use . It does n't leave the boat , sir , honest . I may be a little off , but all this translates to a course of about two-two-zero and a speed of ten knots . And that aims him right at the entrance of Route One . Okay ? " " Go on . " Mancuso had already figured that one . Jonesy was on to something . " Well , I could n't sleep after that , so I skipped back to sonar and pulled the tape on the contact . I had to run it through the computer a few times to filter out all the crap  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I rerecorded it at ten times normal speed . " He set his cassette recorder on the chart table . " Listen to this , Skipper . " The tape was scratchy , but every few seconds there was a thrum . Two minutes of listening seemed to indicate a regular interval of about five seconds . By this time Lieutenant Mannion was looking over Thompson 's shoulder , listening , and nodding speculatively.  | " Skipper , that 's got ta be a man-made sound . It 's just too regular for anything else . At normal speed it did n't make much sense , but once I speeded it up , I had the sucker . " " Okay , Jonesy , finish it , " Mancuso said . " Captain , what you just heard was the acoustical signature of a Russiansubmarine . He was heading for Route One , taking the inshore track off the Icelandic coast . You can bet money on that , Skipper . " " Roger ? " " He sold me , Captain , " Thompson replied . Mancuso took another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative . There was n't any . " Me , too . Roger , Jonesy makes sonarman first class today . I want to see the paper work done by the turn of the next watch , along with a nice letter of commendation for my signature . Ron , " he poked the sonarman in the shoulder , " that 's all right . Damned well done ! " " Thanks , Skipper . " Jones ' smile stretched from ear to ear . " Pat , please call Lieutenant Butler to the attack center . " Mannion went to the phone to call the boat 's chief engineer . " Any idea what it is , Jonesy ? " Mancuso turned back . The sonarman shook his head . " It is n't screw sounds . I 've never heard anything like it . " He ran the tape back and played it again . Two minutes later , Lieutenant Earl Butler came into the attack center . " You rang , Skipper ? " " Listen to this , Earl . " Mancuso rewound the tape and played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Texas and every school the navy had for submarines and their engine systems . " What 's that supposed to be ? " " Jonesy says it 's a Russian sub . I think he 's right . " " Tell me about the tape , " Butler said to Jones . " Sir , it 's speeded up ten times , and I washed it through the BC-10 five times . At normal speed it does n't sound like much of anything . " With uncharacteristic modesty , Jones did not point out that it had sounded like something to him . " Some sort of harmonic ? I mean , if it was a propeller , it 'd have to be a hundred feet across , and we 'd be hearing one blade at a time . The regular interval suggests some sort of harmonic . " Butler 's face screwed up . " But a harmonic what ? " " Whatever it was , it was headed right here . " Mancuso tapped Thor 's Twins with his pencil . " That makes him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then they 're using something new . Again . " " Mr. Butler 's right , " Jones said . " It does sound like a harmonicp108rumble . The other funny thing is , well , there was this background noise , kinda like water going through a pipe . I do n't know , it did n't pick up on this . I guess the computer filtered it off . It was real faint to start with  --  anyway , that 's outside my field . " " That 's all right . You 've done enough for one day . How do you feel ? " Mancuso asked . " A little tired , Skipper . I 've been working on this for a while . " " If we get close to this guy again , you think you can track him down ? " Mancuso knew the answer . " You bet , Cap'n ! Now that we know what to listen for , you bet I 'll bag the sucker ! " Mancuso looked at the chart table . " Okay , if he was heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say twenty-eight or thirty knots , and then settled down to his base course and speed of about ten or so . . . that puts him about here now . Long ways off . Now , if we run at top speed .. . forty-eight hours will put us here , and that 'll put us in front of him . Pat ? " " That 's about right , sir , " Lieutenant Mannion concurred . " You 're figuring he ran the route at full speed , then settled down  --  makes sense . He would n't need the quiet drive in that damned maze . It gives him a free shot for four or five hundred miles , so why not uncrank his engines ? That 's what I 'd do . " " That 's what we 'll try and do , then . We 'll radio in for permission to leave Toll Booth station and track this character down . Jonesy , running at max speed means you sonarmen will be out of work for a while . Set up the contact tape on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this guy sounds like , but get some rest . All of you . I want you at a hundred percent when we try to reacquire this guy . Have yourself a shower . Make that a Hollywood shower  --  you 've earned it  --  and rack out . When we do go after this character , it 'll be a long , tough hunt . " " No sweat , Captain . We 'll get him for you . Bet on it . You want to keep my tape , sir ? " " Yeah . " Mancuso ejected the tape and looked up in surprise . " You sacrificed a Bach for this ? " " Not a good one , sir . I have a Christopher Hogwood of this piece that 's much better . " Mancuso pocketed the tape . " Dismissed , Jonesy . Nice work . " " A pleasure , Cap'n . " Jones left the attack center counting the extra money for jumping a rate . " Roger , make sure your people are well rested over the next two days . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a bastard . " " Aye , Captain . " " Pat , get us up to periscope depth . We 're going to call this one intop109Norfolk right now . Earl , I want you thinking about what 's making that noise . " " Right , Captain . " While Mancuso drafted his message , Lieutenant Mannion brought the Dallas to periscope-antenna depth with an upward angle on the diving planes . It took five minutes to get from five hundred feet to just below the stormy surface . The submarine was subject to wave action , and while it was very gentle by surface ship standards , the crew noted her rocking . Mannion raised the periscope and ESM ( electronic support measures ) antenna , the latter used for the broad-band receiver designed to detect possible radar emissions . There was nothing in view  --  he could see about five miles  --  and the ESM instruments showed nothing except for aircraft sets , which were too far away to matter . Next Mannion raised two more masts . One was a reedlike UHF ( ultrahigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a laser transmitter . This rotated and locked onto the carrier wave signal of the Atlantic SSIX , the communications satellite used exclusively by submarines . With the laser , they could send highdensitytransmissions without giving away the sub 's position . " All ready , sir , " the duty radioman reported . " Transmit . " The radioman pressed a button . The signal , sent in a fraction of a second , was received by photovoltaic cells , read over to a UHF transmitter , and shot back down by a parabolic dish antenna towards Atlantic Fleet Communications headquarters . At Norfolk another radioman noted the reception and pressed a button that transmitted the same signal up to the satellite and back to the Dallas . It was a simple way to identify garbles . The Dallas operator compared the received signal with the one he 'd just sent . " Good copy , sir . " Mancuso ordered Mannion to lower everything but the ESM and UHF antennae . Atlantic Fleet CommunicationsIn Norfolk the first line of the dispatch revealed the page and line of the one-time-pad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maximum security section of the communications complex . An officer typed the proper numbers into his computer terminal , and an instant later the machine generated a clear text . The officer checked it again for garbles . Satisfied there were none , he took the printout to the other side of the room where a yeoman was seated at a telex . The officer handed him the dispatch . The yeoman keyed up the proper addressee and transmitted thep110message by dedicated landline to COMSUBLANT Operations , half a mile away . The landline was fiber optic , located in a steel conduit under a paved street . It was checked three times a week for security purposes . Not even the secrets of nuclear weapons performance were as closely guarded as day-to-day tactical communications . COMSUBLANT OperationsA bell went off in the operations room as the message came up on the " hot " printer . It bore a Z prefix , which indicated FLASH-priority status .

A lieutenant junior grade took the dispatch to the office of Vice Admiral Vincent Gallery . COMSUBLANT had been on duty since the Soviet subs had started moving . He was in an evil mood . " A FLASH priority from Dallas , sir . " " Uh-huh . " Gallery took the yellow form and read it twice . " What do you suppose this means ? " " No telling , sir . Looks like he heard something , took his time figuring it out , and wants another crack at it . He seems to think he 's onto something unusual . " " Okay , what do I tell him ? Come on , mister .

" On the other hand , Dallas is commanded by a fairly competent man who would n't be bothering us unless he really t bought he had something . He does n't go into specifics , probably because it 's too complicated for a tactical FLASH dispatch , and also because he thinks that we know his judgment is good enough to take his word on something . New drive system with unusual sound characteristics . ' That ' nay be a crock , but he 's the man on the scene , and he wants an answer . We tell him yes .

When you asked him a question , by God , you got an answer , yes or no , before you could rig your antenna in . Of course , he reflected , if it turned out that Jonesy was wrong and this was a wild-goose chase , he 'd have some explaining to do . Gallery had handed more than one sub skipper his head in a bag and set him on the beach . Which was where he was headed regardless , Mancuso knew . Since his first year at Annapolis all he had ever wanted was command of his own attack boat . He had that now , and he knew that the rest of his career would be downhill . In the rest of the navy your first command was just that , a first command . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually , if you were lucky and had the right stuff . Not submariners , though . Whether he did well with the Dallas or poorly , he 'd lose her soon enough . He had this one and only chance . And afterwards , what ? The best he could hope for was command of a missile boat . He 'd served on those before and was sure that commanding one , even a new Ohio , was about as exciting as watching paint dry . The boomer 's job wasp112to stay hidden . Mancuso wanted to be the hunter , that was the exciting end of the business . And after commanding a missile boat ? He could get a " major surface command , " perhaps a nice oiler  --  it would be like switchingmounts from Secretariat to Elsie the Cow . Or he could get a squadron command and sit in an office onboard a tender , pushing paper . At best in that position he 'd go to sea once a month , his main purpose being to bother sub skippers who did n't want him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pentagon  --  what fun ! Mancuso understood why some of the astronautshad cracked up after coming back from the moon . He , too , had worked many years for this command , and in another year his boat would be gone . He 'd have to give the Dallas to someone else . But he did have her now . " Pat , let 's lower all masts and take her down to twelve hundred feet . " " Aye aye , sir . Lower the masts , " Mannion ordered . A petty officer pulled on the hydraulic control levers . " ESM and UHF masts lowered , sir , " the duty electrician reported . " Very well . Diving officer , make your depth twelve hundred feet . " " Twelve hundred feet , aye , " the diving officer responded . " Fifteendegrees down-angle on the planes . " " Fifteen degrees down , aye .

But they were not machines . They were men . His . In the reactor spaces aft , Lieutenant Butler had his enginemen acknowledgethe command and gave the necessary orders . The reactor coolant pumps went to fast speed . An increased amount of hot , pressurizedwater entered the exchanger , where its heat was transferred to the steam on the outside loop . When the coolant returned to the reactor it was cooler than it had been and therefore denser . Being denser , it trapped more neutrons in the reactor pile , increasing the ferocity of the fission reaction and giving off yet more power . Farther aft , saturated steam in the " outside " or nonradioactive loop of the heat exchange system emerged through clusters of control valves to strike the blades of the high-pressure turbine . The Dallas ' huge bronze screw began to turn more quickly , driving her forward and down . The engineers went about their duties calmly . The noise in the engine spaces rose noticeably as the systems began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track of this by continuously monitoring the banks of instruments under their hands . The routine was quiet and exact . There was no extraneous conversation , no distraction . Compared to a sub/marine 's reactor spaces , a hospital operating room was a den of libertines . Forward , Mannion watched the depth gauge go below six hundred feet . The diving officer would wait until they got to nine hundred feet before starting to level off , the object being to zero the dive out exactly at the ordered depth . Commander Mancuso wanted the Dallas below the t hermocline . This was the border between differing temperatures . Water settled in isothermal layers of uniform stratification . The relatively flat boundary where warmer surface water met colder deep water was a semipermeable barrier which tended to reflect sound waves . Those waves that did manage to penetrate the thermocline were mostly trapped below it . Thus , though the Dallas was now running below the thermocline at over thirty knots and making as much noise as she was capable of , she would still be difficult to detect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but then , there was not much down there to run into . Mancuso lifted the microphone for the PA system . " This is the captain speaking . We have just started a speed run that will last forty-eight hours . We are heading towards a point where we hope to locate a Russian sub that went past us two days ago . This Russkie is evidently using a new and rather quiet propulsion system that nobody 's run across before . We 're going to try and get ahead of him and track on him as he passes us again . This time we know what to listen for , and we 'll get a nice clear picture of him . Okay , I want everyone on this boat to be well rested . When we get t here , it 'll be a long , tough hunt . I want everybody at a hundred percent . " Phis one will probably be interesting . " He switched off the microphone . " What 's the movie tonight ? " The diving officer watched the depth gauge stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was also manager of the Dallas ' cable TV system , three video-cassette recorders in the mess room which led to televisions in the wardroom , and various other crew accommodations . " Skipper , you got a choice . Return of the Jedi or two football tapes : Oklahoma-Nebraska and Miami-Dallas . Both those games were played while we were on the exercise , sir . It 'll be like watching them live . " He laughed . " Commercials and all . The cooks are already making the pop-corn . " " Good . I want everybody nice and loose . " Why could n't they ever get Navy tapes , Mancuso wondered . Of course , Army had creamed them this year . . . " Morning , Skipper . " Wally Chambers , the executive officer , came into the attack center . " What gives ? " " Come on back to the wardroom , Wally . I want you to listen to something . " Mancuso took the cassette from his shirt pocket and led Chambers aft.  |p114The  V. K. KonovalovTwo hundred miles northeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Konovalov was racing southwest at forty-one knots . Captain Tupolev sat alone in the wardroom rereading the dispatch he 'd received two days before . His emotions alternated between rage and grief . The Schoolmasterhad done that ! He was dumbfounded . But what was there to do ? Tupolev 's orders were explicit , the more so since , as his zampolit had pointed out , he was a former pupil of the traitor Ramius . He , too , could find himself in a very bad position . If the slug succeeded . So , Marko had pulled a trick on everyone , not just the Konovalov . Tupolev had been slinking around the Barents Sea like a fool while Marko had been heading the other way . Laughing at everyone , Tupolev was sure . Such treachery , such a hellish threat against the Rodina . It was inconceivable  --  and all too conceivable . All the advantages Marko had . A four-room apartment , a dacha , his own Zhiguli . Tupolev did not yet have his own automobile . He had earned his way to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ! He 'd be lucky to keep what he had . I have to kill a friend , he thought . Friend ? Yes , he admitted to himself , Marko had been a good friend and a fine teacher . Where had he gone wrong ? Natalia Bogdanova . Yes , that had to be it . A big stink , the way that had happened . How many times had he had dinner with them , how many times had Natalia laughed about her fine , strong , big sons ? He shook his head . A fine woman killed by a damned incompetent fool of a surgeon . Nothing could be done about it , he was the son of a Central Committee member . It was an outrage the way things like that still happened , even after three generations of building socialism . But nothing was sufficient to justify this madness . Tupolev bent over the chart he 'd brought back . He 'd be on his station in five days , in less time if the engine plant held together and Marko was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be . Marko was a fox , not a bull . The other Alfas would get there ahead of his , Tupolev knew , but it did n't matter . He had to do this himself . He 'd get ahead of Marko and wait . Marko would try to slink past , and the Konovalov would be there . And the Red October would die . The North AtlanticThe British Sea Harrier FRS.4 appeared a minute early . It hovered briefly off the Kennedy 's port beam as the pilot sized up his landing target , the wind , and sea conditions . Maintaining a steady thirty-knot forward speed to compensate for the carrier 's forward speed , he side/slipped his fighter neatly to the right , then dropped it gently amidships , slightly forward of the Kennedy 's island structure , exactly in the center of the flight deck . Instantly a gang of deck crewmen raced for the aircraft , three carrying heavy metal chocks , another a metal ladder which he set up by the cockpit , whose canopy was already coming open . A team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager to demonstrate the speed with which the U.S. Navy services aircraft . The pilot was dressed in an orange coverall and yellow life jacket . He set his helmet on the back of the front seat and came down the ladder . He watched briefly to be sure his fighter was in capable hands before sprinting to the island . He met Ryan at the hatch . " You Ryan ? I 'm Tony Parker . Where 's the loo ? " Jack gave him the proper directions and the pilot darted off , leaving Ryan standing there in a flight suit , holding his bag and feeling stupid . A white plastic flight helmet dangled from his other hand as he watched the crewmen fueling the Harrier . He wondered if they knew what they were doing . Parker was back in three minutes . " Commander , " he said , " there 's one thing they 've never put in a fighter , and that 's a bloody toilet . They fill you up with coffee and tea and send you off , and you 've no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything else you have to do ? " " No , sir . Your admiral chatted with me on the radio when I was flying in . Looks like your chaps have finished fueling my bird . Shall we be off ? " " What do I do with this ? " Ryan held up his bag , expecting to have to hold it in his lap . His briefing papers were inside the flight suit , tucked against his chest . " We put it in the boot , of course . Come along , sir . " Parker walked out to the fighter jauntily . The dawn was a feeble one . There was a solid overcast at one or two thousand feet . It was n't raining , but looked as though it might . The sea , still rolling at about eight feet , was a gray , crinkled surface dotted with whitecaps . Ryan could feel the Kennedy moving , surprised that something so huge could be made to move at all . When they got to the Harrier , Parker took the duffle in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fighter . Twisting and pulling the lever , he revealed a cramped space about the size of a small refrigerator . Parker stuffed the bag into it , slamming the door shut behind it , making sure the locking lever was fully engaged . A deck crewman in a yellow shirt conferred with the pilot . Aft a helicopter was revving its engines , and a Tomcat fighter was taxiing towards a midships catapult . On top of this a thirty-knot wind was blowing . The carrier was a noisy place . Parker waved Ryan up the ladder . Jack , who liked ladders about as much as he liked flying , nearly fell into his seat . He struggled to getp116situated properly , while a deck crewman strapped him into the four-point restraint system . The man put the helmet on Ryan 's head and pointed to the jack for its intercom system . Maybe American crews really did know something about Harriers . Next to the plug was a switch . Ryan flipped it . " Can you hear me , Parker ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Right . " Parker 's head swiveled to check the engine intakes . " Starting the engine . " The canopies stayed up . Three crewmen stood close by with large carbon dioxide extinguishers , presumably in case the engine exploded . A dozen others were standing by the island , watching the strange aircraft as the Pegasus engine screamed to life . Then the canopy came down . " Ready , Commander ? " " If you are . " The Harrier was not a large fighter , but it was certainly the loudest . Ryan could feel the engine noise ripple through his body as Parker adjusted his thrust-vector controls . The aircraft wobbled , dipped at the nose , then rose shakily into the air . Ryan saw a man by the island point and gesture to them . The Harrier slid to port , moving away from the island as it gained in height . " That was n't too bad , " Parker said . He adjusted the thrust controls , and the Harrier began true forward flight . There was little feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly falling behind . A few seconds later they were beyond the inner ring of escorts . " Let 's get on top of this muck , " Parker said . He pulled back on the stick and headed for the clouds . In seconds they were in them , and Ryan 's field of view was reduced from five miles to five feet in an instant . Jack looked around his cockpit , which had flight controls and **25;12136;TOOLONG showed one hundred fifty knots and rising , altitude four hundred feet . This Harrier had evidently been a trainer , but the instrument panel had been altered to include the read-out instrumentsfor a sensor pod that could be attached to the belly . A poor man 's way of doing things , but from what Admiral Painter said it had evidently worked well enough . He figured the TV-type screen was the FLIR readout , which monitored a forward-looking infrared heat sensor . The airspeed gauge now said three hundred knots , and the climb indicator showed a twenty-degree angle of attack . It felt like more than that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Parker said . " Now ! " The altimeter showed twenty-six thousand feet when Ryan was blasted by pure sunlight . One thing about flying that he never got used to was that no matter how awful the weather was on the ground , if you flew high enough you could always find the sun . The light was intense , but the sky'sp117color was noticeably deeper than the soft blue seen from the ground . The ride became airliner smooth as they escaped the lower turbulence . Ryan fumbled with his visor to shield his eyes . " That better , sir ? " " Fine , Lieutenant . It 's better than I expected . " " What do you mean , sir ? " Parker inquired . " I guess it beats flying on a commercial bird . You can see more . That helps . " " Sorry we do n't have any extra fuel , or I 'd show you some aerobatics . The Harrier will do almost anything you ask of her . " " That 's all right . " " And your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you do n't fancy flying . " Ryan 's hands grabbed the armrests as the Harrier went through three complete revolutions before snapping back to level flight . He surprised himself by laughing . " Ah , the British sense of humor . " " Orders from your admiral , sir , " Parker semi-apologized . " We would n't want you to think the Harrier 's another bloody bus . " Which admiral , Ryan wondered , Painter or Davenport ? Probably both . The top of the clouds was like a rolling field of cotton . He 'd never appreciated that before , looking through a foot-square window on an airliner . In the back seat he almost felt as if he were sitting outside . " May I ask a question , sir ? " " Sure . " " What 's the flap ? " " What do you mean ? " " I mean , sir , that they turned my ship around . Then I get orders to ferry a VIP from Kennedy to Invincible . " " Oh , okay . Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your boss . I 'm just the mailman , " Ryan lied . Roll that one three times . " Excuse me , Commander , but you see , my wife is expecting a child , our first , soon after Christmas . I hope to be there , sir . " " Where do you live ? " " Chatham , that 's  --  " " I know . I live in England myself at the moment . Our place is in Marlow , upriver from London . My second kid got started over there . " " Born there ? " " Started there . My wife says it 's those strange hotel beds , do it to her every time . If I were a betting man , I 'd give you good odds , Parker . First babies are always late anyway . " " You say you live in Marlow ? " " ' That 's right , we built a house there earlier this year . " " Jack Ryan  --  John Ryan ' ? The same chap who  --  "  | " Correct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Understood , sir . I did n't know you were a naval officer . " " That 's why you do n't have to tell anyone . " " Yes , sir . Sorry for the stunt earlier . " " That 's all right . Admirals must have their little laughs . I understand you guys just ran an exercise with our guys . " " Indeed we did , Commander . I sank one of your submarines , the Tullibee . My systems operator and I , that is . We caught her near the surface at night with our FLIR and dropped noisemakers all round her . You see , we did n't let anyone know about our new equipment . All 's fair , as you know . I understand her commander was bloody furious . I 'd hoped to meet him in Norfolk , but he did n't arrive until the day we sailed . " " You guys have a good time in Norfolk ? " " Yes , Commander . We were able to get in a day 's shooting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you call it . " " Oh yeah ? I used to hunt there . How was it ? " " Not bad . I got my three geese in half an hour . Bag limit was three  --  stupid . " " You called in and blasted three geese in a half hour this late in the season ? " " That is how I earn my modest living , Commander , shooting , " Parker commented . " I was up for a grouse shoot with your admiral last September . They made me use a double . If you show up with my kind of gun  --  I use a Remington automatic  --  they look at you like you 're some kind of terrorist . I got stuck with a pair of Purdeys that did n't fit . Got fifteen birds . Seemed an awful lazy way to hunt , though , with one guy loading my gun for me , and another platoon of ghillies driving the game . We just about annihilated the bird population , too . " " We have more game per acre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiral said . How far to Invincible ? " " Forty minutes . " Ryan looked at the fuel gauges . They were half empty already . In a car he 'd be thinking about a fill-up . All that fuel gone in half an hour . Well , Parker did n't seem excited . The landing on HMS Invincible was different from the COD 's arrival on the Kennedy . The ride became rocky as Parker descended through the clouds , and it occurred to Ryan that they were on the leading edge of the same storm he 'd endured the night before . The canopy was coated with rain , and he heard the impact of thousands of raindrops on the airframe  --  or was it hail ? Watching the instruments , he saw that Parker leveled out at a thousand feet , while they were still in clouds , then descended more slowly , breaking into the clear at a hundred feet . The Invincible wasp119scarcely half the Kennedy 's size . He watched her bobbing actively on the fifteen-foot seas . Parker used the same technique as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , then slid to the right , dropping the fighter twenty feet onto a painted circle . The landing was hard , but Ryan was able to see it coming . The canopy came up at once . " You can get out here , " Parker said . " I have to taxi to the elevator . " A ladder was in place . He unbuckled and got out . A crewman had already retrieved his bag . Ryan followed him to the island and was met by an ensign  --  a sublieutenant , the British call the rank . " Welcome aboard , sir . " The youngster could n't be more than twenty , Ryan thought . " Let me help you out of the flight suit . " The sublieutenant stood by as Ryan unzipped and took off his helmet , Mae West , and coverall . He retrieved his cap from the bag . In the process he bounced off the bulkhead a few times . The Invincible seemed to be corkscrewing in a following sea . A bow wind and a following sea ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy . The officer took his bag , and Ryan held onto the briefing material . " Lead on , leftenant , " Ryan gestured . The youngster shot up a series of three ladders , leaving Jack panting behind , thinking about the jogging he was n't getting in . The combination of the ship 's motion and an inner ear badly scrambled from the day 's flying made him dizzy , and he found himself bumping into things . How did professional pilots do it ? " Here 's the flag bridge , sir . " The sublieutenant held the door open . " Hello , Jack ! " boomed the voice of Vice Admiral John White , eighth earl of Weston . He was a tall , well-built man of fifty with a florid complexion set off by a white scarf at his neck . Jack had first met him earlier in the year , and since then his wife Cathy and the countess , Antonia , had become close friends , members of the same circle of amateur musicians . Cathy Ryan played classical piano . Toni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guarnieri del Jesu violin . Her husband was a man whose peerage was treated as a convenient afterthought . His career in the Royal Navy had been built entirely on merit . Jack walked over to take his hand . " Good day , Admiral . " " How was your flight ? " " Different . I 've never been in a fighter before , much less one with ambitions to mate with a hummingbird , " Ryan smiled . The bridge was overheated , and it felt good . " Jolly good . Let 's go aft to my sea cabin . " White dismissed thesublieutenant , who handed Jack his bag before withdrawing . The admiralled him aft through a short passageway and left into a small compartment . It was surprisingly austere , considering that the English liked theircomforts and that White was a peer . There were two curtained portholes ,  |p120a  desk , and a couple of chairs . The only human touch was a color photograph of his wife . The entire port wall was covered with a chart of the North Atlantic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the upholstered chair . " I am tired . I 've been on the go since  --  hell , since 6:00 A.M. yesterday . I do n't know about time changes , I think my watch is still on European time . " " I have a message for you . " White pulled a slip of paper from his pocket and handed it over . " Greer to Ryan . WILLOW confirmed , " Ryan read . " Basil sends regards . Ends . " Somebody had confirmed WILLOW . Who ? Maybe Sir Basil , maybe Ritter . Ryan would not quote odds on that one . Jack tucked it in his pocket . " This is good news , sir . " " Why the uniform ? " " Not my idea , Admiral . You know who I work for , right ? They figured I 'd be less conspicuous this way . " " At least it fits . " The admiral lifted a phone and ordered refreshments sent to them . " How 's the family , Jack ? " " Fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Cathy and Toni were playing over at Nigel Ford 's place . I missed it . You know , if they get much better , we ought to have a record cut . There are n't too many violin players better than your wife . " A steward arrived with a plateful of sandwiches . Jack had never figured out the British taste for cucumbers on bread . " So , what 's the flap ? " " Admiral , the significance of the message you just gave me is that I can tell this to you and three other officers . This is very hot stuff , sir . You 'll want to make your choices accordingly . " " Hot enough to turn my little fleet around . " White thought it over before lifting the phone and ordering three of his officers to the cabin . He hung up . " Captain Carstairs , Captain Hunter , and Commander Barclay  --  theyare , respectively , Invincible 's commanding officer , my fleet operations officer , and my fleet intelligence officer . " " No chief of staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something for your coffee ? " Whiteextracted what looked like a brandy bottle from a desk drawer . " Thank you , Admiral . " He was grateful for the brandy . The coffeeneeded the help . He watched the admiral pour a generous amount , perhaps with the ulterior motive of making him speak more freely . Whitehad been a British sailor longer than he 'd been Ryan 's friend . The three officers arrived together , two carrying folding metal chairs . " Admiral , " Ryan began , " you might want to leave that bottle outAfter you hear this story , we might all need a drink . " He passed out hi%p121two remaining briefing folders and talked from memory . His delivery took fifteen minutes . " Gentlemen , " he concluded , " I must insist that this information be kept strictly confidential . For the moment no one outside this room may learn it . " " That is too bad , " Carstairs said . " This makes for a bloody good sea story . " " And our mission ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot of brandy , gave the bottle a brief look , then stowed it back in the desk . " Thank you , Admiral . For the moment our mission is to locate Red October . After that we 're not sure . I imagine just locating her will be hard enough . " " An astute observation , Commander Ryan , " Hunter said . " The good news is that Admiral Painter has requested that CINCassignyou control of several U.S. Navy vessels , probably three1052-class frigates , and a pair of FFG 7 Perrys . They all carry a chopper ortwo . " " Well , Geoffrey ? " White asked . " It 's a start , " Hunter agreed . " " They 'll be arriving in a day or two . Admiral Painter asked me to express his confidence in your group and its personnel . " " A whole fucking Russian missile submarine ... " Barclay said almost to himself . Ryan laughed . " Like the idea , Commander ? " At least he had one convert . " What if the sub is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British operation ? " Barclay asked pointedly . " I suppose it would , but from the way I read the map , if Ramius washeading for England , he 'd already be there . I saw a copy of the president'sletter to the prime minister . In return for your assistance , the Royal Navy gets the same access to the data we develop as our guys get . We 're on the same side , gentlemen . The question is , can we do it ? " " Hunter ? " the admiral asked . If this intelligence is correct . .. I 'd say we have a good chance , perhaps as good as fifty percent . On one hand , we have a missile submarineattempting to evade detection . On the other , we have a great deal of ASW arrayed to locate her , and she will be heading towards one ofonly a few discrete locations . Norfolk , of course , Newport , Groton , King 's Bay , Port Everglades , Charleston . A civilian port such as NewYork is less likely , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hisAlfas racing to your coast , they will get there ahead of October . They mayhave a specific port target in mind . We 'll know that in another day . So , I'dsay they have an equal chance . They 'll be able to operate far enough offp122your coast that your government will have no viable legal reason to object to whatever they do . If anything , I 'd say the Soviets have the advantage . They have both a clearer idea of the submarine 's capabilities and a simpler overall mission . That more than balances their less capable sensors . " " Why is n't Ramius coming on faster ? " Ryan asked . " That 's the one thing I ca n't figure . Once he clears the SOSUS lines off Iceland , he 's clear into the deep basin  --  so why not crack his throttles wide open and race for our coast ? " " At least two reasons , " Barclay answered . " How much operational intelligence data do you see ? " " I handle individual assignments . That means I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know a good deal about their boomers , for example , but not as much about their attack boats . " Ryan did n't have to explain he was CIA . " Well , you know how compartmentalized the Sovs are . Ramius probablydoes n't know where their attack submarines are , not all of them . So , if he were to race about , he 'd run the off chance of blundering into a stray Victor and being sunk without ever knowing what was happening . Second , what if the Soviets did enlist American assistance , saying perhaps that a missile sub had been taken over by a mutinous crew of Maoist counterrevolutionaries  --  and then your navy detects a missile submarine racing down the North Atlantic towards the American coast . What would your president do ? " " Yeah , " Ryan nodded . " We 'd blow it the hell out of the water . " " There you have it . Ramius is in the trade of stealth , and he 'll likely stick to what he knows , " Barclay concluded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " How soon will we have performance data on this quiet drive system ? " Carstairs wanted to know . " Next couple of days , we hope . " " Where does Admiral Painter want us ? " White asked . " The plan he submitted to Norfolk puts you on the right flank . He wants Kennedy inshore to handle the threat from their surface force . He wants your force farther out . You see , Painter thinks there 's the chance that Ramius will come straight south from the G-I-U.K. gap into the Atlantic basin and just sit for a while . The odds favor his not being detected there , and if the Soviets send the fleet after him , he 's got the time and supplies to sit out there longer than they can maintain a force off our coast  --  both for technical and political reasons . Additionally , he wants your striking power out here to threaten their flank . It has to be approved by the commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet , and a lot ofp123details remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some E-3 Sentries to support you out here . " " A month in the middle of the North Atlantic in winter ? " Carstairs winced . He had been the Invincible 's executive officer during the war around the Falklands and had ridden in the violent South Atlantic for endless weeks . " Be happy for the E-3s . " The admiral smiled . " Hunter , I want to see plans for using all these ships the Yanks are giving us , and how we can cover a maximum area . Barclay , I want to see your evaluation of what our friend Ramius will do . Assume he 's still the clever bastard we 've come to know and love . " " Aye aye , sir . " Barclay stood with the others . " Jack , how long will you be with us ? " " I do n't know , Admiral . Until they recall me to the Kennedy , I guess . Ft om where I sit , this operation was laid on too fast . Nobody really knows what the hell we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you let us see to this for a while ? You look exhausted . Get some sleep . " " True enough , Admiral . " Ryan was beginning to feel the brandy . " There 's a cot in the locker over there . I 'll have someone set it up for you , and you can sleep in here for the time being . If anything comes in for you , we 'll get you up . " " That 's kind of you , sir . " Admiral White was a good guy , Jack thought , and his wife was something very special . In ten minutes , Ryan was on the cot and asleep . The Red OctoberEvery two days the starpom collected the radiation badges . This was part of a semiformal inspection . After seeing to it that every crewman 's shoes were spit-shined , every bunk was properly made , and every footlocker was arranged according to the book , the executive officer would take the two-day-old badges and hand the sailors new ones , usually along with some terse advice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had this procedure down to a science . Today , as always , the trip from one compartment to another took two hours . When he was finished , the bag on his left hip was full of old badges , and the one on his right was depleted of new ones . He took the badges to the ship 's medical office . " Comrade Petrov , I have a gift for you . " Borodin set the leather bag on the physician 's desk . " Good . " The doctor smiled up at the executive officer . " With all the healthy young men I have little to do but read my journals . " Borodin left Petrov to his task . First the doctor set the badges out inp124order . Each bore a three-digit number . The first digit identified the badge series , so that if any radiation were detected there would be a time reference . The second digit showed where the sailor worked , the third where he slept . This system was easier to work with than the old one , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cookbook-simple . Petrov could do it without a thought . First he switched off the white overhead light and replaced it with a red one . Then he locked his office door . Next he took the development rack from its holder on the bulkhead , broke open the plastic holders , and transferred the film strips to spring clips on the rack . Petrov took the rack into the adjacent laboratory and hung it on the handle of the single filing cabinet . He filled three large square basins with chemicals . Though a qualified physician , he had forgotten most of his inorganic chemistry and did n't remember exactly what the developing chemicals were . Basin number one was filled from bottle number one . Basin two was filled from bottle two , and basin three , he remembered , was filled with water . Petrov was in no hurry . The midday meal was not for two more hours , and his duties were truly boring . The last two days he had been reading his medical texts on tropical diseases . The doctor was looking forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck a crewman would come down with some obscure malady , and he 'd have something interesting to work on for once . Petrov set the lab timer for seventy-five seconds and submerged the film strips in the first basin as he pressed the start button . He watched the timer under the red light , wondering if the Cubans still made rum . He had been there , too , years before , and acquired a taste for the exotic liquor . Like any good Soviet citizen , he loved his vodka but had the occasional hankering for something different . The timer went off and he lifted the rack , shaking it carefully over the tank . No sense getting the chemical  --  silver nitrate ? something like that  --  on his uniform . The rack went into the second tank , and he set the timer again . Pity the orders had been so damned secret  --  he could have brought his tropical uniform . He 'd sweat like a pig in the Cuban heat . Of course , none of those savages ever bothered to wash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He 'd see . The timer dinged again , and Petrov lifted the rack a second time , shaking it and setting it in the water-filled basin . Another boring job completed . Why could n't a sailor fall down a ladder and break something ? He wanted to use his East German X-ray machine on a live patient . He did n't trust the Germans , Marxists or not , but they did make good medical equipment , including his X-ray , autoclave , and most of his pharmaceuticals . Time . Petrov lifted the rack and held it up against the X-ray reading plate , which he switched on.  | " Nichevo ! " Petrov breathed . He had to think . His badge was fogged . Its number was 3-4-8 : third badge series , frame fifty-four ( the medical office , galley section ) , aft ( officers ' ) accommodations . Though only two centimeters across , the badges were made with variable sensitivity . Ten vertically segmented columns were used to quantifythe exposure level . Petrov saw that his was fogged all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fogged to segment five , and the torpedomen , who spent all their time forward , showed contaminationonly in segment one . " Son of a bitch . " He knew the sensitivity levels by heart . He took the manual down to check them anyway . Fortunately , the segments were logarithmic . His exposure was twelve rads . Fifteen to twenty-five for the engineers . Twelve to twenty-five rads in two days , not enough to be dangerous . Not really life threatening , but . . . Petrov went back into his office , careful to leave the films in the lab . He picked up the phone . " Captain Ramius ? Petrov here . Could you come aft to my office , p l ease ? " " On the way , Comrade Doctor . " Ramius took his time . He knew what the call was about . The day before they sailed , while Petrov had been ashore procuring drugs for his cupboard , Borodin had contaminated the badges with the X-ray machine . " Yes , Petrov ? " Ramius closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radiation leak . " " Nonsense . Our instruments would have detected it at once . " Petrov got the films from the lab and handed them to the captain . " Look here . " Ramius held them up to the light , scanning the film strips top to bottom . He frowned . " Who knows of this ? " " You and I , Comrade Captain . " " You will tell no one  --  no one . " Ramius paused . " Any chance that the films were  --  that they have something wrong , that you made an error in the developing process ? " Petrov shook his head emphatically . " No , Comrade Captain . Only you , Comrade Borodin , and I have access to these . As you know , I tested indom samples from each batch three days before we sailed . " Petrov Nould n't admit that , like everyone , he had taken the samples from the toopp of the box they were stored in . They were n't really random . " " I'he maximum exposure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understated it . " Whose numbers ? " " Bulganin and Surzpoi . The torpedomen forward are all under three tads . " Very well . What we have here , Comrade Doctor , is a possiblep126minor  --  minor , Petrov  --  leak in the reactor spaces . At worst a gas leak of some sort . This has happened before , and no one has ever died from it . The leak will be found and fixed . We will keep this little secret . There is no reason to get the men excited over nothing . " Petrov nodded agreement , knowing that men had died in 1970 in an accident on the submarine Voroshilov , more in the icebreaker Lenin . Both accidents were a long time ago , though , and he was sure Ramius could handle things . Was n't he ? The PentagonThe E ring was the outermost and largest of the Pentagon 's rings , and since its outside windows offered something other than a view of sunless courtyards , this was where the most senior defense officials had their offices . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the J-3 . He was n't there . He was down in a subbasementroom known colloquially as the Tank because its metal walls were dotted with electronic noisemakers to foil other electronic devices . He had been there for twenty-four hours , though one would not have known this from his appearance . His green trousers were still creased , his khaki shirt still showed the folds made by the laundry , its collar starched plywood-stiff , and his tie was held neatly in place by a gold marine corps tiepin . Lieutenant General Edwin Harris was neither a diplomat nor a service academy graduate , but he was playing peacemaker . An odd position for a marine . " God damn it ! " It was the voice of Admiral Blackburn , CINCLANT . Also present was his own operations officer , Rear Admiral Pete Stanford . " Is this any way to run an operation ? " The Joint Chiefs were all there , and none of them thought so . " Look , Blackie , I told you where the orders come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chiefs of Staff , sounded tired . " I understand that , General , but this is largely a submarine operation , right ? I got ta get Vince Gallery in on this , and you should have Sam Dodge working up at this end . Dan and I are both fighter jocks , Pete 's an ASW expert . We need a sub driver in on this . " " Gentlemen , " Harris said calmly , " for the moment the plan we have to take to the president need only deal with the Soviet threat . Let 's hold this story about the defecting boomer in abeyance for the moment , shall we ? " " I agree , " Stanford nodded . " We have enough to worry about right here . " The attention of the eight flag officers turned to the map table . FiftyeightSoviet submarines and twenty-eight surface warships , plus a gaggle of oilers and replenishment ships , were unmistakably heading for thep127American coast . To face this , the U.S. Navy had one available carrier . The Invincible did not rate as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet vessels carried over three hundred surface-to-surface cruise missiles . Though principally designed as antiship weapons , the third of them believed to carry nuclear warheads were sufficient to devastate the cities on the East Coast . From a position off New Jersey , these missiles could range from Norfolk to Boston . " Josh Painter proposes that we keep Kennedy inshore , " Admiral Blackburn said . " He wants to run the ASW operation from his carrier , transferring his light attack squadrons to shore and replacing them with S-3s . He wants Invincible out on their seaward flank . " " I do n't like it , " General Harris said . Neither did Pete Stanford , and they had agreed earlier that the J-3 would launch the counterplan . " Gentlemen , if we 're only going to have one deck to use , we damned well ought to have a carrier and not an oversized ASW platform . " " We 're listening , Eddie , " Hilton said . " Let 's move Kennedy out here . " He moved the counter to a position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squadrons . We move Invincibleinshore to handle the ASW work . It 's what the Brits designed her for , right ? They 're supposed to be good at it . Kennedy is an offensive weapon , her mission is to threaten them . Okay , if we deploy like this , she is the threat . From over here she can range against their surface force from outside their surface-to-surface missile perimeter  --  " " Better yet , " Stanford interjected , pointing to some vessels on the map , " threaten this service force here . If they lose these oilers , they ai n't going home . To meet that threat they 'll have to redeploy themselves . For starters , they 'll have to move Kiev offshore to give themselves some kind of air defense against Kennedy . We can use the spare S-3s from shore bases . They can still patrol the same area . " He traced a line about five hundred miles off the coast . " Leaves Invincible kind of naked , though , " the CNO , Admiral Foster , noted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brits . " Blackburn looked at the air force chief of staff , General Claire Barnes . " You want help , you get help , " Barnes said . " We 'll have a Sentry operating over Invincible at dawn tomorrow , and if you move her inshore we can maintain that round the clock . I 'll throw in a wing of F-16s if you want . " " What do you want in return , Max ? " Foster asked . Nobody called him Claire . " The way I see this , you have Saratoga 's air wing sitting around doing nothing . Okay , by Saturday I 'll have five hundred tactical fighters deployedfrom Dover to Loring . My boys do n't know much about antishipp128stuff . They 'll have to learn in a hurry . I want you to send your kids to work with mine , and I also want your Tomcats . I like the fighter-missile combination . Let one squadron work out of Iceland , the other out of New England to track the Bears Ivan 's starting to send our way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll send some tankers to Lajes to help keep Kennedy'sbirds flying . " " Blackie ? " Foster asked . " Deal , " Blackburn nodded . " The only thing that bothers me is that Invincible does n't have all that much ASW capacity . " " So we get more , " Stanford said . " Admiral , what say we take Tarawa out of Little Creek , team her with New Jersey 's group , with a dozen ASW choppers aboard and seven or eight Harriers ? " " I like it , " Harris said quickly . " Then we have two baby carriers with a noteworthy striking force right in front of their groups , Kennedy playing stalking tiger to their east , and a few hundred tactical fighters to the west . They have to come into a three-way box . This actually gives us more ASW patrolling capacity than we 'd have otherwise . " " Can Kennedy handle her mission alone out there ? " Hilton asked . " Depend on it , " Blackburn replied . " We can kill any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour . The ones nearest shore will be your job , Max . " " How long did you two characters rehearse this ? " General Maxwell , commandant of the marine corps , asked the operations officers . Everyonechuckled . The Red OctoberChief Engineer Melekhin cleared the reactor compartment before beginningthe check for the leak . Ramius and Petrov were there also , plus the engineering duty officers and one of the young lieutenants , Svyadov . Three of the officers carried Geiger counters . The reactor room was quite large . It had to be to accommodate the massive , barrel-shaped steel vessel . The object was warm to the touch despite being inactive . Automatic radiation detectors were in every corner of the room , each surrounded by a red circle . More were hanging on the fore and aft bulkheads . Of all the compartments on the submarine , this was the cleanest . The deck and bulkheads were spotless whitepaintedsteel . The reason was obvious : the smallest leak of reactor coolant had to be instantly visible even if all the detectors failed . Svyadov climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel to run the detachable probe from his counter over every welded pipe joint . The speaker-annunciator on the hand-held box was turned to maximum so that everyone in the compartment could hear it , and Svyadov had an earpiece plugged in for even greater sensitivity . Ap129youngster of twenty-one , he was nervous . Only a fool would feel entirely safe looking for a radiation leak . There is a joke in the Soviet Navy : How do you tell a sailor from the Northern Fleet ? He glows in the dark . It had been a good laugh on the beach , but not now . He knew that he was conducting the search because he was the youngest , least experienced , and most expendable officer . It was an effort to keep his knees from wobbling as he strained to reach all over and around the reactor piping . The counter was not entirely silent , and Svyadov 's stomach cringed at each click generated by the passage of a random particle through the tube of ionized gas . Every few seconds his eyes flickered to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe range , hardly registering at all . The reactor vessel was a quadruple-layer design , each layer several centimeters of tough stainless steel . The three inner spaces were filled with a barium-water mixture , then a barrier of lead , then polyethylene , all designed to prevent the escape of neutrons and gamma particles . The combination of steel , barium , lead , and plastic successfully contained the dangerous elements of the reaction , allowing only a few degrees of heat to escape , and the dial showed , much to his relief , that the radiation level was less than that on the beach at Sochi . The highest reading was made next to a light bulb . This made the lieutenant smile . " All readings in normal range , comrades , " Svyadov reported . " Start over , " Melekhin ordered , " from the beginning . " Twenty minutes later Svyadov , now sweating from the warm air that gathered at the top of the compartment , made an identical report . He came down awkwardly , his arms and legs tired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did well , Svyadov . " " Thank you , Comrade Captain . It 's warm up there from the lights and the coolant pipes . " The lieutenant handed the counter to Melekhin . The lower dial showed a cumulative count , well within the safe range . " Probably some contaminated badges , " the chief engineer commentedsourly . " It would not be the first time . Some joker in the factory or at the yard supply office  --  something for our friends in the GRU to check into . Wreckers ! ' A joke like this ought to earn somebody a bullet . " " Perhaps , " Ramius chuckled . " Remember the incident on Lenin ? " Ile referred to the nuclear-powered icebreaker that had spent two years tied to the dock , unusable because of a reactor mishap . " A ship 's cook had some badly crusted pans , and a madman of an engineer suggested that he use live steam to get them cleaned . So the idiot walked down to the steam generator and opened an inspection valve , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I remember it ! I was a staff engineering officer then . The captain had asked for a Kazakh cook  --  "  | " He liked horsemeat with his kasha , " Ramius said. "  --  and the fool did n't know the first thing about a ship . Killed himself and three other men , contaminated the whole fucking compartment for twenty months . The captain only got out of the gulag last year . " " I bet the cook got his pans cleaned , though , " Ramius observed . " Indeed , Marko Aleksandrovich  --  they may even be safe to use in another fifty years . " Melekhin laughed raucously . That was a hell of a thing to say in front of a young officer , Petrov thought . There was nothing , nothing at all funny about a reactor leak . But Melekhin was known for his heavy sense of humor , and the doctor imagined that twenty years of working on reactors allowed him and the captain to view the potential dangers phlegmatically . Then , there was the implicit lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong into the reactor spaces . " Very well , " Melekhin said , " now we check the pipes in the generator room . Come , Svyadov , we still need your young legs . " The next compartment aft contained the heat exchanger/steam generator , turboalternators , and auxiliary equipment . The main turbines were in the next compartment , now inactive while the electrically driven caterpillar was operating . In any case , the steam that turned them was supposed to be clean . The only radioactivity was in the inside loop . The reactor coolant , which carried short-lived but dangerous radioactivity , never flashed to steam . This was in the outside loop and boiled from uncontaminated water . The two water supplies met but never mixed inside the heat exchanger , the most likely site for a coolant leak because of its more numerous fittings and valves . The more complex piping required a full fifty minutes to check . These pipes were not as well insulated as those forward . Svyadov nearly burned himself twice , and his face was bathed in perspiration by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all safe again , comrades . " " Good , " Melekhin said . " Come down and rest a moment before you check it again . " Svyadov almost thanked his chief for that , but this would not have done at all . As a young , dedicated officer and member of the Komsomol , no exertion was too great . He came down carefully , and Melekhin handed him another cigarette . The chief engineer was a gray-haired perfectionist who took decent care of his men . " Why , thank you , Comrade , " Svyadov said . Petrov got a folding chair . " Sit , Comrade Lieutenant , rest your legs . " The lieutenant sat down at once , stretching his legs to work out theknots . The officers at VVMUPP had told him how lucky he was to drawthis assignment . Ramius and Melekhin were the two best teachers in thep131fleet , men whose crews appreciated their kindness along with their competence . " They really should insulate those pipes , " Ramius said . Melekhin shook his head . " Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counter to his captain . " Entirely safe , " the captain read off the cumulative dial . " You get more exposure tending a garden . " " Indeed , " Melekhin said . " Coal miners get more exposure than we do , from the release of radon gas in the mines . Bad badges , that 's what it has to be . Why not take out a whole batch and check it ? " " I could , Comrade , " Petrov answered . " But then , due to the extended nature of our cruise , we 'd have to run for several days without any . Contrary to regulations , I 'm afraid . " " You are correct . In any case the badges are only a backup to our instruments . " Ramius gestured to the red-circled detectors all over the compartment . " Do you really want to recheck the piping ? " Melekhin asked . " I think we should , " Ramius said . Svyadov swore to himself , looking down at the deck . " There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine . " Sorry , Lieutenant . " The doctor was not a bit sorry . He had been genuinely worried , and was now feeling a lot better . An hour later the second check had been completed . Petrov took Svyadov forward for salt tablets and tea to rehydrate himself . The senior officers left , and Melekhin ordered the reactor plant restarted . The enlisted men filed back to their duty stations , looking at one another . Their officers had just checked the " hot " compartments with radiation instruments . The medical corpsman had looked pale a while earlier and refused to say anything . More than one engine attendant fingered his radiation badge and checked his wristwatch to see how long it would be before he went off duty.  |p132THE  EIGHTH DAYFRIDAY , 10 DECEMBERHMS InvincibleRyan awoke in the dark . The curtains were drawn on the cabin 's two small portholes . He shook his head a few times to clear it and began to assess what was going on around him . The Invincible was moving on the seas , but not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a porthole and saw the last red glow of sunset aft under scudding clouds . He checked his watch and did some clumsy mental arithmetic , concluding that it was six in the evening , local time . That translated to about six hours of sleep . He felt pretty good , considering . A minor headache from the brandy  --  so much for the theory that good stuff does n't give you a hangover  --  and his muscles were stiff . He did a few sit-ups to work out the knots . There was a small bathroom  --  head , he corrected himself  --  adjoining the cabin . Ryan splashed some water on his face and washed his mouth out , not wanting to look in the mirror . He decided he had to . Counterfeit or not , he was wearing his country 's uniform and he had to look presentable . It took a minute to get his hair in place and the uniform arranged properly . The CIA had done a nice job of tailoring , given such short notice . Finished , he went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jack ? " Admiral White pointed him to a tray full of cups . It was only tea , but it was a start . " Thank you , Admiral . Those few hours really helped . I guess I 'm in time for dinner . " " Breakfast , " White corrected him with a laugh.  | " What  --  uh , pardon me , Admiral ? " Ryan shook his head again . He was still a little groggy . " That 's a sunrise , Commander . Change in orders , we 're heading west again . Kennedy 's moving east at high speed , and we 're to take station inshore . " " Who said , sir ? " " CINCLANT . I gather Joshua was not at all pleased . You are to remain with us for the moment , and under the circumstances it seemed the reasonable thing to let you sleep . You did appear to need it . " Must have been eighteen hours , Ryan thought . No wonder he felt stiff . " You do look much better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He got up , took Ryan 's arm , and guided him aft . " Now for breakfast . I 've been waiting for you . Captain Hunter will brief you on our revised orders . Weather 's clearing up for a few days , they tell me . Escort assignments are being reshuffled . We 're to operate in conjunction with your New Jersey group . Our antisubmarine operations begin in earnest in another twelve hours . It 's a good thing you got that extra sleep , lad . You 'll bloody need it . " Ryan ran his hand over his face . " Can I shave , sir ? " " We still permit beards . Let it wait until after breakfast . " Flag quarters on HMS Invincible were not quite up to the standard of those on the Kennedy  --  but close . White had a private dining area . A steward in a white livery served them expertly , setting a third place for Hunter , who appeared within a few minutes . When they started talking , the steward was excused . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hours . We already have them on radar . Two more 1052s , plus an oiler and two Perrys will join us in another thirty-six hours . They were on their way home from the Med . With our own escorts , a total of nine warships . A noteworthy collection , I think . We 'll be working five hundred miles offshore , with the New Jersey  --  Tarawa force two hundred miles to our west . " " Tarawa ? What do we need a regiment of marines for ? " Ryan asked . Hunter explained briefly . " Not a bad idea , that . The funny thing is , with Kennedy racing for the Azores , that rather leaves us guarding the American coast . " Hunter grinned . " This may be the first time the Royal Navy has ever done that  --  certainly since it belonged to us . " " What are we up against ? " " The first of the Alfas will be on your coast tonight , four of them ahead of all the others . The Soviet surface force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups . One is built around their carrier Kiev , two cruisers and four destroyers ; the second , probably the force flag , is built around Kirov , with three additional cruisers and six destroyers ; and thep134third is centered on Moskva , three more cruisers and seven destroyers . I gather that the Soviets will want to use the Kiev and Moskva groups inshore , with Kirov guarding them out to sea  --  but Kennedy 's relocation will make them rethink that . Regardless , the total force carries a considerablenumber of surface-to-surface missiles , and potentially , we are very exposed . To help out with that , your air force has an E-3 Sentry detailed to arrive here in an hour to exercise with our Harriers , and when we get farther west , we 'll have additional land-based air support . On the whole our position is hardly an enviable one , but Ivan 's is rather less so . So far as the question of finding Red October is concerned ? " Hunter shrugged . " How we conduct our search will depend on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracking drills . The lead Alfa is eighty miles northwest of us , steaming at forty-plus knots , and we have a helicopter in pursuit  --  which is roughly what it amounts to , " the fleet operations officer concluded . " Will you join us below ? " " Admiral ? " Ryan wanted to see Invincible 's combat information center . " Certainly . " Thirty minutes later Ryan was in a darkened , quiet room whose walls were a solid bank of electronic instruments and glass plotting panels . The Atlantic Ocean was full of Russian submarines . The White HouseThe Soviet ambassador entered the Oval Office a minute early , at 10:59 A.M. He was a short , overweight man with a broad Slavic face and eyes that would have done a professional gambler proud . They revealed nothing . He was a career diplomat , having served in a number of posts throughout the Western world , and a thirty-year member of the Communistparty 's Foreign Department . " Good morning , Mr. President , Dr. Pelt . " Alexei Arbatov nodded politely to both men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated behind his desk . Every other time he 'd been here the president had come around the desk to shake hands , then sat down beside him . " Help yourself to some coffee , Mr. Ambassador , " Pelt offered . The special assistant to the president for national security affairs was well known to Arbatov . Jeffrey Pelt was an academic from the Georgetown University 's Center for Strategic and International Studies  --  an enemy , but a well-mannered , kulturny enemy . Arbatov had a fondness for the niceties of formal behavior . Today , Pelt was standing at his boss 's side , unwilling to come too close to the Russian bear . Arbatov did not get himself any coffee . " Mr. Ambassador , " Pelt began , " we have noted a troubling increase in Soviet naval activity in the North Atlantic . "  | " Oh ? " Arbatov 's eyebrows shot up in a display of surprise that fooled no one , and he knew it . " I have no knowledge of this . As you know , I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bullshit , Mr. Ambassador ? " the president said . Arbatov did not permit himself to be surprised by the vulgarity . It made the American president seem very Russian , and like Soviet officials he seemed to need a professional like Pelt around to smooth the edges . " You currently have nearly a hundred naval vessels operating in the North Atlantic or heading in that direction . Chairman Narmonov and my predecessor agreed years ago that no such operation would take place without prior notification . The purpose of this agreement , as you know , was to prevent acts that might appear to be unduly provocative to one side or the other . This agreement has been kept  --  until now . " Now , my military advisers tell me that what is going on looks very much like a war exercise , indeed , could be the precursor to a war . How are we to tell the difference ? Your ships are now passing east of Iceland , and will soon be in a position from which they can threaten our trade routes to Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the most a grave and wholly unwarranted provocation . The scope of this action has not yet been made public . That will change , and when it does , Alex , the American people will demand action on my part . " The president paused , expecting a response but getting only a nod . Pelt went on for him . " Mr. Ambassador , your country has seen fit to cast aside an agreement which for years has been a model of East-West cooperation . How can you expect us to regard this as anything other than a provocation ? " " Mr. President , Dr. Pelt , truly I have no knowledge of this . " Arbatov lied with the utmost sincerity . " I will contact Moscow at once to ascertain the facts . Is there any message you wish me to pass along ? " " Yes . As you and your superiors in Moscow will understand , " the president said , " we will deploy our ships and aircraft to observe yours . Prudence requires this . We have no wish to interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not our intention to make a provocation of our own , but under the terms of our agreement we have the right to know what is going on , Mr. Ambassador . Until we do , we are unable to issue the proper orders to our men . It would he well for your government to consider that having so many of your ships and our ships , your aircraft and our aircraft in close proximity is an inherently dangerous situation . Accidents can happen . An action by one side or the other which at another time would seem harmless might seem to he something else entirely . Wars have begun in this way , Mr. Ambassador . " The president leaned back to let that thought hang in the air for a moment . When he went on , he spoke more gently . " Of course , I regardp136this possibility as remote , but is it not irresponsible to take such chances ? " " Mr. President , you make your point well , as always , but as you know , the sea is free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ambassador , " Pelt interrupted , " consider a simple analogy . Your next-door neighbor begins to patrol his front yard with a loaded shotgun while your children are at play in your own front yard . In this country such action would be technically legal . Even so , would it not be a matter of concern ? " " So it would , Dr. Pelt , but the situation you describe is very dif-ferent  --  " Now the president interrupted . " Indeed it is . The situation at hand isfar more dangerous . It is the breach of an agreement , and I find that especially disquieting . I had hoped that we were entering a new era of Soviet-American relations . We have settled our trade differences . We have just concluded a new grain agreement . You had a major part in that . We have been moving forward , Mr. Ambassador  --  is this at an end ? " The president shook his head emphatically . " I hope not , but the choice is yours . The relationship between our countries can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust that I have not alarmed you . As you know , it is my habit to speak plainly . I personally dislike the greasy dissimulation of diplomacy . At times like this , we must communicate quickly and clearly . We have a dangerous situation before us , and we must work together , rapidly , to resolve it . My military commanders are greatly concerned , and I need to know  --  today  --  what your naval forces are up to . I expect a reply by seven this evening . Failing that I will be on the direct line to Moscow to demand one . " Arbatov stood . " Mr. President , I will transmit your message within the hour . Please keep in mind , however , the time differential between Washington and Moscow  --  " " I know that a weekend has just begun , and that the Soviet Union is a worker 's paradise , but I expect that some of your country 's managers may still be at work . In any case , I will detain you no further . Good day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat down . " Maybe I was just a little tough on him , " the president said . " Yes , sir . " Pelt thought that he had been too damned tough . He had little affection for the Russians but he too liked the niceties of diplomatic exchange . " I think we can say that you succeeded in getting your message across . " " He knows . " " He knows . But he does n't know we know . " " We think , " the president grimaced . " What a crazy goddamned gamep137this is ! And to think I had a nice , safe career going for me putting mafiosi in jail . . . Do you think he 'll snap at the bait I offered ? " " Legitimate operations ? ' Did you see his hands twitch at that ? He 'll go after it like a marlin after a squid . " Pelt walked over to pour himself half a cup of coffee . It pleased him that the china service was gold trimmed . " I wonder what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably a rescue mission . If they call it a fleet exercise they admit to violating the notification protocol . A rescue operation justifies the level of activity , the speed with which it was laid on , and the lack of publicity . Their press never reports this sort of thing . As a guess , I 'd say they 'll call it a rescue , say a submarine is missing , maybe even to the point of calling it a missile sub . " " No , they wo n't go that far . We also have that agreement about keeping our missile subs five hundred miles offshore . Arbatov probably has his instructions on what to tell us already , but he 'll play for all the time he can . It 's also vaguely possible that he 's in the dark . We know how they compartmentalize information . You suppose we 're reading too much into his talent for obfuscation ? " " I think not , sir . It is a principle of diplomacy , " Pelt observed , " that one must know something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The president smiled . " Well , they 've had enough time to play this game . I hope my belated reaction will not disappoint them . " " No , sir . Alex must have half expected you to kick him out the door . " " The thought 's occurred to me more than once . His diplomatic charm has always been lost on me . That 's the one thing about the Russians  --  they remind me so much of the mafia chieftains I used to prosecute . The same smattering of culture and good manners , and the same absence of morality . " The president shook his head . He was talking like a hawk again . " Stay close , Jeff . I have George Farmer coming in here in a few minutes , but I want you around when our friend comes back . " Pelt walked back to his office pondering the president 's remark . It was , he admitted to himself , crudely accurate . The most wounding insult to an educated Russian was to be called nekulturny , uncultured  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who sat in the gilt boxes at the Moscow State Opera weeping at the end of a performance of Boris Gudunov could immediately turn around and order the execution or imprisonment of a hundred men without blinking . A strange people , made more strange by their political philosophy . But the president had too many sharp edges , and Pelt wished he 'd learn to soften them . A speech in front of the American Legion was one thing , a discussion with the ambassador of a foreign power was something else.  |p138CIA  Headquarters " CARDINAL 's in trouble , Judge . " Ritter sat down . " No surprise there . " Moore removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes . Something Ryan had not seen was the cover note from the station chief in Moscow saying that to get his latest signal out , CARDINAL had bypassedhalf the courier chain that ran from the Kremlin to the U.S. embassy . The agent was getting bold in his old age . " What does the station chief say exactly ? " " CARDINAL 's supposed to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ... " " He 's getting old , and it is winter over there , but who believes in coincidences ? " Moore looked down at his desk . " What do you suppose they 'd do if they 've turned him ? " " He 'd die quietly . Depends on who turned him . If it was the KGB , they might want to make something out of it , especially since our friend Andropov took a lot of their prestige with him when he left . But I do n't think so . Given who his sponsor is , it would raise too much of a ruckus . Same thing if the GRU turns him . No , they 'd grill him for a few weeks , then quietly do away with him . A public trial would be too counterpro-ductive . " Judge Moore frowned . They sounded like doctors discussing a terminallyill patient . He did n't even know what CARDINAL looked like . There was a photograph somewhere in the file , but he had never seen it . It was easier that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look a defendant in the eye ; he 'd just reviewed the law in a detached way . He tried to keep his stewardship of the CIA the same way . Moore knew that this might be perceived as cowardly , and was very different from what people expect of a DCI  --  but even spies got old , and old men developed consciences and doubts that rarely troubled the young . It was time to leave the " Company . " Nearly three years , it was enough . He 'd accomplishedwhat he was supposed to do . " Tell the station chief to lay off . No inquiries of any kind directed at CARDINAL . If he 's really sick , we 'll be hearing from him again . If not , we 'll know that soon enough , too . " " Right . " Ritter had succeeded in confirming CARDINAL 's report . One agent had reported that the fleet was sailing with additional political officers , another that the surface force was commanded by an academic sailor and crony of Gorshkov , who had flown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sailed . The naval architect who was believed to have designed the Red October was supposed to have gone with him . A British agent had reported that detonators for the various weapons carried by the surface ships had been hastily taken aboard fromp139their usual storage depots ashore . Finally , there was an unconfirmed report that Admiral Korov , commander of the Northern Fleet , was not at his command post ; his whereabouts were unknown . Together the information was enough to confirm the WILLOW report , and more was still coming in . The U.S. Naval Academy " Skip ? " " Oh , howdy , Admiral . Will you join me ? " Tyler waved to a vacant chair across the table . " I got a message from the Pentagon for you . " The superintendent of the Naval Academy , a former submarine officer , sat down . " You have an appointment tonight at 1930 hours . That 's all they said . " " Great ! " Tyler was just finishing his lunch . He 'd been working on the simulation program nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have access to the air force 's Cray-2 tonight . I lis program was just about ready . " What 's this all about anyway ? " " Sorry , sir , I ca n't say . You know how it is. " lire White HouseThe Soviet ambassador was back at four in the afternoon . To avoid press notice he had been taken into the Treasury building across the street from the White House and brought through a connecting tunnel which few k new existed . The president hoped that he had found this unsettling . Pelt hustled in to be there when Arbatov arrived . " Mr. President , " Arbatov reported , standing at attention . The presi dent had not known that he had any military experience . " I am instructed to convey to you the regrets of my government that there has not been time to inform you of this . One of our nuclear submarines is missing and l-csumed lost . We are conducting an emergency rescue operation . " The president nodded soberly , motioning the ambassador to a chair . Pelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassing , Mr. President . You see , in our navy as in yours , duty on a nuclear submarine is a posting of the greatest importance , and consequently those selected for it are among our best educated and trusted men . In this particular case se.veral members of the crew  --  the officers , that is  --  are sons of high Party officials . One is even the son of a Central Committee member  --  I can not ay which , of course . the Soviet Navy 's great effort to find her sons is understandable , though I admit a bit undisciplined . " Arbatov feigned embarrassment beautifully , speaking as though he were confiding a great family secret . " Therefore ,  |p140this  has developed into what your people call an all hands ' operation . As you undoubtedly know , it was undertaken virtually overnight . " " I see , " the president said sympathetically . " That makes me feel a little better , Alex . Jeff , I think it 's late enough in the day . How about you fix us all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thank you , sir . " Pelt walked over to a rosewood cabinet against the wall . The ornate antique contained a small bar , complete with an ice bucket which was stocked every afternoon . The president often liked to have a drink or two before dinner , something else that reminded Arbatov of his countrymen . Dr. Pelt had had ample experience playing presidential bartender . In a few minutes he came back with three glasses in his hands . " To tell you the truth , we rather suspected this was a rescue operation , " Pelt said . " I do n't know how we get our young men to do this sort of work . " The president sipped at his drink . Arbatov worked hard on his . He had said frequently at local cocktail parties that he preferred American bourbon to his native vodka . Maybe it was true . " We 've lost a pair of nuclear boats , I believe . How many does this make for you , three , four ? " " I do n't know , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than my own . " The president noted that he had just told the truth for the first time today . " Certainly I can agree with you that such duty is both dangerous and demanding . " " How many men aboard , Alex ? " the president asked . " I have no idea . A hundred more or less , I suppose . I 've never been aboard a naval vessel . " " Mostly kids , probably , just like our crews . It is indeed a sad commentary on both our countries that our mutual suspicions must condemn so many of our best young men to such hazards , when we know that some wo n't be coming back . But  --  how can it be otherwise ? " The president paused , turning to look out the windows . The snow was melting on the South Lawn . It was time for his next line . " Perhaps we can help , " the president offered speculatively . " Yes , perhaps we can use this tragedy as an opportunity to reduce those suspicions by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this to demonstrate that our relations really have improved . " Pelt turned away , fumbling for his pipe . In their many years of friendship he could never understand how the president got away with so much . Pelt had met him at Washington University , when he was majoring in political science , the president in prelaw . Back then the chief executive had been president of the dramatics society . Certainly amateur theatrics had helped his legal career . It was said that at least one Mafia don hadp141been sent up the river by sheer rhetoric . The president referred to it as his sincere act . " Mr. Ambassador , I offer you the assistance and the resources of the United States in the search for your missing countrymen . " " That is most kind of you , Mr. President , but  --  " The president held his hand up . " No buts , Alex . If we can not cooperatein something like this , how can we hope to cooperate in more serious matters ? If memory serves , last year when one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of your fishing vessels "  --  it had been an intelligence trawler  --  " picked up the crew , saved their lives . Alex , we owe you a debt for that , a debt of honor , and the United States will not be said to be.ungrateful . " He paused for effect . " They 're probably all dead , you know . I do n't suppose there 's more chance of surviving a sub accidentthan of surviving a plane crash . But at least the crew 's families will know . Jeff , do n't we have some specialized submarine rescue equip-ment ? " " With all the money we give the navy ? We damned well ought to . I 'll call Foster about it . " " Good , " the president said . " Alex , it is too much to expect that our mutual suspicions will be allayed by something so small as this . Your history and ours conspire against us . But let 's make a small beginning with this . If we can shake hands in space or over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here also . I will give the necessary instructions to my commanders as soon as we 're finished here . " " Thank you , Mr. President . " Arbatov concealed his uneasiness . " And please convey my respects to Chairman Narmonov and my sympathy for the families of your missing men . I appreciate his effort , and yours , in getting this information to us . " " Yes . Mr. President . " Arbatov rose . He left after shaking hands . What were the Americans really up to ? He 'd warned Moscow : call it a rescue mission and they 'd demand to help . It was their stupid Christmas season , and Americans were addicted to happy endings . It was madness not to call it something else  --  to hell with the protocol . At the same time he was forced to admire the American president . A strange man , very open , yet full of guile . A friendly man most of the time , yet always ready to seize the advantage . He remembered stories his grandmother had told , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , " the president said after the doors closed , " now we can keep a nice close eye on them , and they ca n't complain . They 're lying and we know it  --  but they do n't know we know . And we 're lying , and they certainly suspect it , but not why we 're lying . Gawdl and I told him thisp142morning that not knowing was dangerous ! Jeff , I 've been thinking about this . I do not like the fact that so much of their navy is operating off our coast . Ryan was right , the Atlantic is our ocean . I want the air force and the navy to cover them like a goddamned blanket ! That 's our ocean , and I damned well want them to know it . " The president finished off his drink . " On the question of the sub , I want our people to have a good look at it , and whoever of the crew wants to defect , we take care of . Quietly , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having the officers is as great a coup as having the submarine . " " But the navy will still want to keep it . " " I just do n't see how we can do that , not without eliminating the crewmen , and we ca n't do that . " " Agreed . " The president buzzed his secretary . " Get me General Hilton . " The PentagonThe air force 's computer center was in a subbasement of the Pentagon . The room temperature was well below seventy degrees . It was enough to make Tyler 's leg ache where it met the metal-plastic prosthesis . He was used to that . Tyler was sitting at a control console . He had just finished a trial run of his program , named MORAY after the vicious eel that inhabits oceanic reefs . Skip Tyler was proud of his programming ability . He 'd taken the old dinosaur program from the files of the Taylor Lab , adapted it to the common Defense Department computer language , ADA  --  named for Lady Ada Lovelace , daughter of Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people this would have been a month 's work . He 'd done it in four days , working almost around the clock not only because the money was an attractive incentive but also because the project was a professional challenge . He ended the job quietly satisfied that he could still meet an impossible deadline with time to spare . It was eight in the evening . MORAY had just run through a one-variable-value test and not crashed . He was ready . He 'd never seen the Cray-2 before , except in photographs , and he was pleased to have a chance to use it . The -2 was five units of raw electrical power , each one roughly pentagonal in shape , about six feet high and four across . The largest unit was the main-frame processor bank ; the other four were memory banks , arrayed around it in a cruciformconfiguration . Tyler typed in the command to load his variable sets . For each of the Red October 's main dimensions  --  length , beam , height  --  he input ten discrete numerical values . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block and prismatic coefficients . There werep143five sets of tunnel dimensions . This aggregated to over thirty thousand possible permutations . Next he keyed in eighteen power variables to cover the range of possible engine systems . The Cray-2 absorbed this information and placed each number in its proper slot . It was ready to run . " Okay , " he announced to the system operator , an air force master sergeant . " Roge . " The sergeant typed " XQT " into his terminal . The Cray-2 went to work . Tyler walked over to the sergeant 's console . " That 's a right lengthy program you 've input , sir . " The sergeant laid a ten-dollar bill on the top of the console . " Betcha my baby can run it in ten minutes . " " Not a chance . " Tyler laid his own bill next to the sergeant 's . " Fifteen minutes , easy . " " Split the difference ? " " Alright . Where 's the head around here ? " " Out the door , sir , turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left . " Tyler moved towards the door . It annoyed him that he could not walk gracefully , but after four years the inconvenience was a minor one . He was alive  --  that 's what counted . The accident had occurred on a cold , clear night in Groton , Connecticut , only a block from the shipyard 's main gate . On Friday at three in the morning he was driving home after a twenty-hour day getting his new command ready for sea . The civilian yard worker had had a long day also , stopping off at a favorite watering hole for a few too many , as the police established afterwards . He got into his car , startedlit , and ran a red light , ramming Tyler 's Pontiac broadside at fifty miles per hour . For him the accident was fatal . Skip was luckier . It was at an intersection , and he had the green light ; when he saw the front end of the Ford not a foot from his left-side door , it was far too late . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the next week , when he hovered near death at the Yale  --  New Haven hospital , was a complete blank . His most vivid memory was of waking up , eight days later he was to learn , to see his wife , Jean , holding his hand . His marriage up to that point had been a troubled one , not an uncommon problem for nuclear submarine officers . His first sight of her was not a complimentary one  --  her eyes were bloodshot , her hair was tousled  --  but she had never looked quite so good . He had never appreciated just how important she was . A lot more important than half a leg . " Skip ? Skip Tyler ! " The former submariner turned awkwardly to see a naval officer runningtowards him . " Johnnie Coleman ! plow the hell are you ! "  |p144It  was Captain Coleman now , Tyler noted . They had served together twice , a year on the Tecumseh , another on the Shark . Coleman , a weapons expert , had commanded a pair of nuclear subs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jean 's fine . Five kids now , and another on the way . " " Damn ! " They shook hands with enthusiasm . " You always were a randy bugger . I hear you 're teaching at Annapolis . " " Yeah , and a little engineering stuff on the side . " " What are you doing here ? " " I 'm running a program on the air force computer . Checking a new ship configuration for Sea Systems Command . " It was an accurate enough cover story . " What do they have you doing ? " " OP-02 's office . I 'm chief of staff for Admiral Dodge . " " Indeed ? " Tyler was impressed . Vice Admiral Sam Dodge was the current OP-02 . The office of the deputy chief of naval operations for submarine warfare had administrative control of all aspects of submarine operations . " Keeping you busy ? " " You know it ! The crap 's really hit the fan . " " What do you mean ? " Tyler had n't seen the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 've been working on this computer program twenty hours a day since Monday , and I do n't get ops dispatches anymore . " Tyler frowned . He had heard something the other day at the Academy but not paid any attention to it . He was the sort who could focus his whole mind on a single problem . Coleman looked up and down the corridor . It was late on a Friday evening , and they had it entirely to themselves . " Guess I can tell you . Our Russian friends have some sort of major exercise laid on . Their whole Northern Fleet 's at sea , or damned near . They have subs all over the place . " " Doing what ? " " We 're not sure . Looks like they might have a major search and rescue operation . The question is , after what ? They have four Alfas doing a max speed run for our coast right now , with a gaggle of Victors and Charlies charging in behind them . At first we were worried that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blitzed right past those . They 're definitelyheading for our coast , and whatever they 're up to , we 're getting tons of information . " " What do they have moving ? " Tyler asked . " Fifty-eight nuclear subs , and thirty or so surface ships . " " Gawd ! CINCLANT must be going ape ! " " You know it , Skip . The fleet 's at sea , all of it . Every nuke we have is scrambling for a redeployment . Every P-3 Lockheed ever made is eitherp145over the Atlantic or heading that way . " Coleman paused . " You 're still cleared , right ? " " Sure , for the work I do for the Crystal City gang . I had a piece of the evaluation of the new Kirov . " " I thought that sounded like your work . You always were a pretty good engineer . You know , the old man still talks about that job you did for him on the old Tecumseh . Maybe I can get you in to see what 's happening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first cruise after graduating from nuc school in Idaho had been with Dodge . He 'd done a tricky repair job on some ancillary reactor equipment two weeks earlier than estimated with a little creative effort and some back-channel procurement of spare parts . This had earned him and Dodge a flowery letter of commendation . " I bet the old man would love to see you . When will you be finished down here ? " " Maybe half an hour . " " You know where to find us ? " " Have they moved OP-02 ? " " Same place . Call me when you 're finished . My extension is 78730 . Okay ? I got ta get back . " " Right . " Tyler watched his old friend disappear down the corridor , then proceeded on his way to the men 's room , wondering what the Russians were up to . Whatever it was , it was enough to keep a three-star admiral and his four-striped captain working on a Friday night in Christmasseason . " Eleven minutes , 53.18 seconds , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printout was over two hundred pages of data . The cover sheet plotted a rough-looking bell curve of speed solutions , and below it was the noise prediction curve . The case-by-case solutions were printed individually on the remaining sheets . The curves were predictably messy . The speed curve showed the majority of solutions in the ten- to twelveknotrange , the total range going from seven to eighteen knots . The noise curve was surprisingly low . " Sergeant , that 's one hell of a machine you have here . " " Believe it , sir . And reliable . We have n't had an electronic fault all month . " " Can I use a phone ? " " Sure , take your pick , sir . " " Okay , Sarge . " Tyler picked up the nearest phone . " Oh , and dump the program . " " Okay . " He typed in some instructions . " MORAY is . . . gone . Hope you kept a copy , sir . " Tyler nodded and dialed the phone.  | " OP-02A , Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Great ! Hey , the old man wants to see you . Come right up . " Tyler placed the printout in his briefcase and locked it . He thanked the sergeant one more time before hobbling out the door , giving the Cray-2 one last look . He 'd have to get in here again . He could not find an operating elevator and had to struggle up a gently sloped ramp . Five minutes later he found a marine guarding the corridor . " You Commander Tyler , sir ? " the guard asked . " Can I see some ID , please ? " Tyler showed the corporal his Pentagon pass , wondering how many one-legged former submarine officers there might be . " Thank you , Commander . Please go down the corridor . You know the room , sir ? " " Sure . Thanks , Corporal . " Vice Admiral Dodge was sitting on the corner of a desk reading over some message flimsies . Dodge was a small , combative man who 'd made his mark commanding three separate boats , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengthy development program . Now he was " Grand Dolphin , " the senior admiral who fought all the battles with Congress . " Skip Tyler ! You 're looking good , laddie . " Dodge gave Tyler 's leg a furtive glance as he came over to take his hand . " I hear you 're doing a great job at the Academy . " " It 's all right , sir . They even let me scout the occasional ballgame . " " Hmph , shame they did n't let you scout Army . " Tyler hung his head theatrically . " I did scout Army , sir . They were just too tough this year . You heard about their middle linebacker , did n't you ? " " No , what about him ? " Dodge asked . " He picked armor as his duty assignment , and they gave him an earlytrip to Fort Knox  --  not to learn about tanks . To be a tank . " " Ha ! " Dodge laughed . " Johnnie says you have a bunch of new kids . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Tyler said proudly . " Six ? You 're not a Catholic or a Mormon , are you ? What 's with all thisbird hatching ? " Tyler gave his former boss a wry look . He 'd never understood that prejudice in the nuclear navy . It came from Rickover , who had invented the disparaging term bird hatching for fathering more than one child . What the hell was wrong with having kids ? " Admiral , since I 'm not a nuc anymore , I have to do something on nights and weekends . " Tyler arched his eyebrows lecherously . " I hear the Russkies are playing games . "  |p147Dodge  was instantly serious . " They sure are . Fifty-eight attack boats  --  every nuclear boat in the Northern Fleet  --  heading this way with a big surface group , and most of their service forces tagging along . " " Doing what ? " " Maybe you can tell me . Come on back to my inner sanctum . " Dodge led Tyler into a room where he saw another new gadget , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tropic of Cancer to the polar ice pack . Hundreds of ships were represented . The merchantmen were white , with flags to identify their nationality ; the Soviet ships were red , and their shapes depicted their ship type ; the American and allied ships were blue . The ocean was getting crowded . " Christ . " " You got that one right , lad , " Dodge nodded grimly . " How are you cleared ? " " Top secret and some special things , sir . I see everything we have on their hardware , and I do a lot of work with Sea Systems on the side . " " Johnnie said you did the evaluation of the new Kirov they just sent out to the Pacific  --  not bad , by the way . " " These two Alfas heading for Norfolk ? " " Looks like it . And they 're burning a lot of neutrons doing it . " Dodge pointed . " That one 's heading to Long Island Sound as though to block the entrance to New London , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These Victors are not far behind . They already have most of the British ports staked out . By Monday they 'll have two or more subs off every major port we have . " " I do n't like the looks of this , sir . " " Neither do I. Asp you see , we 're nearly a hundred percent at sea ourselves . The interesting thing , though  --  what they 're doing just does n't figure . I  --  " Captain Coleman came in . " I see you let the prodigal son in , sir , " Coleman said . " Be nice to him , Johnnie . I seem to remember when he was a right fair sub driver . Anyway , at first it looked like they were going to block the SLOCs , but they went right past . What with these Alfas , they might be trying to blockade our coast . " " What about out west ? " " Nothing . Nothing at all , just routine activity . " " That does n't make any sense , " Tyler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , if you 're going to war you do n't announce it by kicking every boat to max power either . " " The Russians are a funny bunch , Skip , " Coleman pointed out . " Admiral , if we start shooting at them  --  " " We hurt ' em , " Dodge said . " With all the noise they 're making we have good locations on near all of ' em . They have to know that , too.  |p148That  's the one thing that makes me believe they 're not up to anything really bad . They 're smart enough not to be that obvious  --  unless that 's what they want us to think . " " Have they said anything ? " Tyler asked . " Their ambassador says they 've lost a boat , and since it has a bunch of big shots ' kids aboard , they laid on an all-hands rescue mission . For what that 's worth . " Tyler set his briefcase down and walked closer to the screen . " I can see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ports ? " He paused , thinking rapidly as his eyes scanned the top of the display . " Sir , I do n't see any boomers up here . " " They 're in port  --  all of ' em , on both oceans . The last Delta tied up a few hours ago . That 's funny , too , " Dodge said , looking at the screen again . " All of them , sir ? " Tyler asked as offhandedly as he could . Something had just occurred to him . The display screen showed the Bremerton in the Barents Sea but not her supposed quarry . He waited a few seconds for an answer . Getting none , he turned to see the two officers observing him closely . " Why do you ask , son ? " Dodge said quietly . In Sam Dodge , gentlenesscould be a red warning flag . Tyler thought this one over for a few seconds . He 'd given Ryan his word . Could he phrase his answer without compromising it and still find out what he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side to Skip Tyler 's character , and once he was onto something , his psyche compelled him to run it down . " Admiral , do they have a missile sub at sea , a brand new one ? " Dodge stood very straight . Even so he still had to look up at the younger man . When he spoke , his voice was glacial . " Exactly where did you get that information , Commander ? " Tyler shook his head . " Admiral , I 'm sorry , but I ca n't say . It 's cornpartmented , sir . I think this is something you ought to know , and I 'll try to get it to you . " Dodge backed off to try a different tack . " You used to work for me , Skip . " The admiral was unhappy . He 'd bent a rule to show something to his former subordinate because he knew him well and was sorry that he had not received the command he had worked so hard for . Tyler was technically a civilian , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it really bad was that he knew something himself . Dodge had given him some information , and Tyler was n't giving any back . " Sir , I gave my word , " Skip apologized . " I will try to get this to you . That 's a promise , sir . May I use a phone ? "  | " Outer office , " Dodge said flatly . There were four telephones within sight . Tyler went out and sat at a secretary 's desk . He took his notebook from a coat pocket and dialed the number on the card Ryan had left him . " Acres , " a female voice answered . " Could I speak to Dr. Ryan , please ? " " Dr. Ryan is not here at the moment . " " Then ... give me Admiral Greer , please . " " One moment , please . " " James Greer ? " Dodge was behind him . " Is that who you 're working for ? " " This is ' Greer . Your name Skip Tyler ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me ? " " Yes , sir , I do . " " Where are you ? " " In the Pentagon , sir . " " Okay , I want you to drive right up here . You know how to find the place ? The guards at the main gate will be waiting for you . Get moving , son . " Greer hung up . " You 're working for the CIA ? " Dodge asked . " Sir  --  I ca n't say . If you will excuse me , sir , I have some information to deliver . " " Mine ? " the admiral demanded . " No , sir . I already had it when I came in here . That 's the truth , Admiral . And I will try to get this back to you . " " Call me , ' t Dodge ordered . " We 'll be here all night . " CIA HeadquartersThe drive up the George Washington Parkway was easier than he expected . The decrepit old highway was crowded with shoppers but moved along at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exit and presently found himself at the guard post for the main highway entrance to the CIA . The harrier was down . " Your name Tyler , Oliver W. ? " the guard asked . " ID please . " Tyler handed him his Pentagon pass . " Okay , Commander . Pull your car right to the main entrance . Somebodywill be there to meet you . " It was another two minutes to the main entrance through mostly empty parking lots glazed with ice from yesterday 's melted snow . The armed guard who was waiting for him tried to help him out of the car . Tyler did n't like to he helped . He shrugged him off . Another man was waitingp150for him under the canopied main entrance . They were waved right through to the elevator . He found Admiral Greer sitting in front of his office fireplace , seemingly half asleep . Skip did n't know that the DDI had only returned from England a few hours earlier . The admiral came to and ordered his plain-clothes security officer to withdraw . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . " " That 's quite a fire you have going there , sir . " " I should n't bother . Looking at a fire makes me go to sleep . Of course , I could use a little sleep right now . So , what do you have for me ? " " May I ask where Jack is ? " " You may ask . He 's away . " " Oh . " Tyler unlocked his briefcase and removed the printout . " Sir , Iran the performance model for this Russian sub . May I ask her name ? " Greer chuckled . " Okay , you 've earned that much . Her name is RedOctober . You 'll have to excuse me , son . I 've had a busy couple of days , and being tired makes me forget my manners . Jack says you 're prettysharp . So does your personnel file . Now , you tell me . What 'll she do ? " " Well , Admiral , we have a wide choice of data here , and  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play with computers . I havepeople who do that for me . " " From seven to eighteen knots , the best bet is ten to twelve . With that speed range , you can figure a radiated noise level about the same as that of a Yankee doing six knots , but you 'd have to factor reactor plant noise into that also . Moreover , the character of the noise will be different from what we 're used to . These multiple impeller models do n't put out normal propulsion noises . They seem to generate an irregular harmonic rumble . Did Jack tell you about this ? It results from a back-pressure wave in the tunnels . This fights the water flow , and that makes the rumble . Evidently there 's no way around it . Our guys spent two years trying to find one . What they got was a new principle of hydrodynamics . The water almost acts like air in a jet engine at idle or low speed , except that water does n't compress like air does . So , our guys will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . They 're going to have to get used to a wholly new acoustical signature . Add to that the lower signal intensity , and you have a boat that will be harder to detect than anything they have at this time . " " So that 's what all this says . " Greer riffled through the pages . " Yes , sir . You 'll want to have your own people look through it . The model  --  the program , that is  --  could stand a little improvement . I did n't have much time . Jack said you wanted this in a hurry . May I ask a question , sir ? " " You can try . " Greer leaned back , rubbing his eyes.  | " Is , ah , Red October at sea ? That 's it , is n't it ? They 're trying to locate her right now ? " Tyler asked innocently . " Uh huh , something like that . We could n't figure what these doors meant . Ryan said you might be able to , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Commander . This data might just enable us to find her . " " Admiral , I think Red October is up to something , maybe even trying to defect to the United States . " Greer 's head came around . " Whatever makes you think that ? " " The Russkies have a major fleet operation in progress . They have subs all over the Atlantic , and it looks like they 're trying to blockade our coast . The story is a rescue job for a lost boat . Okay , but Jack shows up Monday with pictures of a new missile boat  --  and today I hear that all of their other missile boats have been recalled to port . " Tyler smiled . " That 's kind of an odd set of coincidences , sir . " Greer turned and stared at the fire . He had just joined the DIA when the army and air force had pulled off the daring raid on the Son Tay prison camp twenty miles west of Hanoi . The raid had been a failure because the North Vietnamese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , something that aerial photographs could not determine . But everything else had gone perfectly . After penetrating hundreds of miles into hostile territory , the raiding force appeared entirely by surprise and caught many of the camp guards literally with their pants down . The Green Berets did a letter-perfect job of getting in and out . In the process they killed several hundred enemy troops , themselves sustaininga single casualty , a broken ankle . The most impressive part of the mission , however , was its secrecy . Operation KINGPIN had been rehearsedfor months , and despite this its nature and objective had not been guessed by friend or enemy  --  until the day of the raid itself . On that day a young air force captain of intelligence went into his general 's office to ask if a deep-penetration raid into North Vietnam had been laid on for the Son Tay prisoner-of-war camp . His astonished commander proceeded to grill the captain at length , only to learn that the bright young officer had seen enough disjointed bits and pieces to construct a clear picture of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers peptic ulcers . " Red October 's going to defect , is n't she ? " Tyler persisted . If the admiral had had more sleep he might have bluffed it out . As itwas , his response was a mistake . " Did Ryan tell you this ? " " Sir , I have n't spoken with Jack since Monday . That 's the truth , sir . " " Then where did you get this other information ? " Greer snapped . " Admiral , I used to wear the blue suit . Most of my friends still do . Ip152hear things , " Tyler evaded . " The whole picture dropped into place an hour ago . The Russkies have never recalled all of their boomers at once . I know , I used to hunt them . " Greer sighed . " Jack thinks the same as you . He 's out with the fleet right now . Commander , if you tell that to anyone , I 'll have your other leg mounted overtop that fireplace . Do you understand me ? " " Aye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her ? " Tyler smiled to himself , thinking that as a senior consultant to Sea Systems Command , he 'd sure as hell get a chance to look at a for-real Russian submarine . " Give her back . After we 've had a chance to look her over , of course . But there 's a lot of things that could happen to prevent our ever seeing her . " It took Skip a moment to grasp what he 'd just been told . " Give her back ! Why , for Christ 's sake ? " " Commander , just how likely do you think this scenario is ? Do you think the whole crew of a submarine has decided to come over to us all at once ? " Greer shook his head . " Smart money is that it 's only the officers , maybe not all of them , and that they 're trying to get over here without the crew 's knowing what they 're up to . " " Oh . " Tyler considered that . " I suppose that does make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't Japan . If somebody landed a MiG-25 here we would n't give it back . " " This is not like holding onto a stray fighter plane . The boat is worth a billion dollars , more if you throw in the missiles and warheads . And legally , the president says , it 's their property . So if they find out we have her , they 'll ask for her back , and we 'll have to give her back . Okay , how will they know we have her ? Those crew members who do n't want to defect will ask to go home . Whoever asks , we send . " " You know , sir , that whoever does want to go back will be in a whole shitload of trouble  --  excuse me , sir . " " A shitload and a half . " Tyler had n't known that Greer was a mustang and could swear like a real sailor . " Some will want to stay , but most wo n't . They have families . Next you 'll ask me if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The thought has occurred to me , " Tyler said . " It 's occurred to us , too . But we wo n't . Murder a hundred men ? Even if we wanted to , there 's no way we could conceal it in this day and age . Hell , I doubt even the Soviets could . Besides that , this simply is not the sort of thing you do in peacetime . That 's one difference between us and them . You can take those reasons in any order you want . " " So , except for the crew , we 'd keep her ... " " Yes , if we could hide her . And if a pig had wings , it could fly . "  | " Lots of places to hide her , Admiral . I can think of a few right here on the Chesapeake , and if we could get her round the Horn , there 's a million little atolls we could use , and they all belong to us . " " But the crew will know , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosses , " Greer explained patiently . " And Moscow will ask for her back . Oh , sure , we 'll have a week or so to conduct , uh , safety and quarantine inspections , to make sure they were n't trying to smuggle cocaine into the country . " The admiral laughed . " A British admiral suggested we invoke the old slave-trading treaty . Somebody did that back in World War II , to put the grab on a German blockade runner right before we got into it . So , we 'll get a ton of intelligence regardless . " " Better to keep her , and run her , and take her apart ... " Tyler said quietly , staring into the orange-white flames on the oak logs . How do we keep her ? he wondered . An idea began to rattle around in his head . " Admiral , what if we could get the crew off without them knowing that we have the submarine ? " " Your full name is Oliver Wendell Tyler ? Well , son , if you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court , I  --  " Greer looked into the engineer 's face . " What do you have in mind ? " While Tyler explained Greer listened intently . " To do this , sir , we 'll have to get the navy in on it right quick . Specifically , we 'll need the cooperation of Admiral Dodge , and if my speed figures for this boat are anything like accurate , we 'll have to move smartly . " Greer rose and walked around the couch a few times to get his circulation going . " Interesting . The timing would be almost impossible , though . " " I did n't say it would be easy , sir , just that we could do it . " " Call home , Tyler . Tell your wife you wo n't be making it home . If I do n't get any sleep tonight , neither do you . There 's coffee behind my desk . First I have to call the judge , then we 'll talk to Sam Dodge . " The USS Pogy " Pogy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on fuel . Have to return to the barn , " the Orion 's tactical coordinator reported , stretching after ten hours at his control console . " Anything you want us to get you ? Over . " " Yeah , have a couple cases of beer sent out , " Commander Wood replied . It was the current joke between P-3C and submarine crews . " Thanks for the data . We 'll take it from here . Out . " Overhead , the Lockheed Orion increased power and turned southwest . The crewmen aboard would each hoist an extra beer or two at dinner , saying it was for their friends on the submarine.  | " Mr. Dyson , take her two hundred feet . One-third speed . " The officer of the deck gave the proper orders as Commander Wood moved over to the plot . The USS Pogy was three hundred miles northeast of Norfolk , awaiting the arrival of two Soviet Alfa-class submarines which several relays of antisubmarine patrol aircraft had tracked all the way from Iceland . The Pogy was named for a distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an undistinguished game fish . She had been at sea for eighteen hours , and was fresh from an extended overhaul at the Newport News shipyard . Nearly everything aboard was either straight from manufacturers ' crates or had been completely worked over by the skilled shipfitters on the James River . This was not to say that everything worked properly . Many items had failed in one way or another on the postoverhaulshakedown the previous week , a fact less unusual than lamentable , Commander Wood thought . The Pogy 's crew was new , too . Wood was on his first deployment as a commanding officer after a year of desk duty in Washington , and too many of the enlisted men were green , just out of sub school at New London , still getting accustomed to their first cruise on a submarine . It takes time for men used to blue skies and fresh air to learn the regime inside a thirty-two-foot-diameter steel pipe . Even the experienced men were making adjustments to their new boat and officers . The Pogy had met her top speed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ship but slower than the speed of the Alfas she was listening to . Like all American submarines , her long suit was stealth . The Alfas had no way of knowing she was there and that they would be easy targets for her weapons , the more so since the patrolling Orion had fed the Pogy exact range information , something that ordinarily takes time to deduce from a passive sonar plot . Lieutenant Commander Tom Reynolds , the executive officer and fire control coordinator , stood casually over the tactical plot . " Thirty-six miles to the near one , and forty on the far one . " On the display they were labeled Pogy-Bait 1 and 2 . Everyone found the use of this service epithet amusing . " Speed forty-two ? " Wood asked . " Yes , Captain . " Reynolds had handled the radio exchange until Black Gull 4 had announced its intention to return to base . " They 're driving those boats for all they 're worth . Right for us . We have hard solutions on both . . . zap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The word from CINCLANT is that their ambassador says they 're on a SAR mission for a lost boat . " His voice indicated what he thought of that . " Search and rescue , eh ? " Reynolds shrugged . " Well , maybe theyp155think they lost a boat off Point Comfort , ' cause if they do n't slow down real fast , that 's where they 'll end up . I 've never heard of Alfas operating this close to our coast . Have you , sir ? " " Nope . " Wood frowned . The thing about the Alfas was that they were fast and noisy . Soviet tactical doctrine seemed to call for them mainly in defensive roles : as " interceptor submarines " they could protect their own missile subs , and with their high speed they could engage American attack submarines , then evade counterattack . Wood did n't think the doctrine was sound , but that was all right with him . " Maybe they want to blockade Norfolk , " Reynolds suggested . " You might have a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any case , we 'll just sit tight and-let them burn right past us . They 'll have to slow as they cross the continental shelf line , and we 'll tag along behind them , nice and quiet . " " Aye , " Reynolds said . If they had to shoot , both men reflected , they 'd find out just how tough the Alfa really was . There had been much talk about the strength of the titanium used for her hull , whether it really would withstand the force of several hundred pounds of high explosive in direct contact . A new shaped-charge warhead for the Mark 48 torpedo had been developed for just this purpose and for handling the equally tough Typhoon hull . Both officers set this thought aside . Their assigned mission was to track and shadow . " The E. S. PolitovskiyPogy-Bait 2 was known to the Soviet Navy as the E. S. Politovskiy . This Alfa-class attack sib was named for the chief engineering officer of the Russian fleet who had sailed all the way around the world to meet his appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served the czar 's navy with skill and a devotion to duty equal to that of any officer in history , but in his diary , which was discovered years later in Leningrad , the brilliant officer had decried in the most violent terms the corruption and excesses of the czarist regime , giving a grim counterpoint to the selfless patriotism he had shown as he sailed knowingly to his death . This made him a genuine hero for Soviet seamen to emulate , and the State had named its greatest engineering achievement in his memory . Unfortunately the Politovskiy had enjoyed no better luck than he had enjoyed in the face of Togo 's guns . The Politovskiy 's acoustical signature was labeled Alfa 3 by the Americans . This was incorrect ; she had been the first of the Alfas . The small , spindle-shaped attack submarine had reached forty-three knots three hours into her initial builder 's trials . Those trials had been cut short only a minute later by an incredible mishap : a fifty-ton right whale had somehowp156blundered in her path , and the Politovskiy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten square meters of bow plating , annihilated the sonar dome , knocked a torpedo tube askew , and nearly flooded the torpedo room . This did not count shock damage to nearly every interior system from electronic equipment to the galley stove , and it was said that if anyone but the famous Vilnius headmaster had been in command , the submarine would surely have been lost . A two-meter segment of the whale 's rib was now a permanent fixture at the officer 's club in Severomorsk , dramatic testament to the strength of Soviet submarines ; in fact the damage had taken over a year to repair , and by the time the Politovskiy sailed again there were already two other Alfas in service . Two days after sailing on her next shakedown , she suffered another major casualty , the total failure of her high-pressure turbine . This had taken six months to replace . There had been three more minor incidents since , and the submarine was forever marked as a bad luck ship . Chief Engineer Vladimir Petchukocov was a loyal Party member and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore profoundly superstitious . In the old days , his ship would have been blessed on launching and thereafter every time she sailed . It would have been an impressive ceremony , with a bearded priest , clouds of incense , and evocative hymns . He had sailed without any of that and found himself wishing otherwise . He needed some luck . Petchukocov was having trouble with his reactor . The Alfa reactor plant was small . It had to fit into a relatively small hull . It was also powerful for its size , and this one had been running at one hundred percent rated power for just over four days . They were racing for the American coast at 42.3 knots , as fast as the eight-year-old plant would permit . The Politovskiy was due for a comprehensive overhaul : new sonar , new computers , and a redesigned reactor control suite were all planned for the coming months . Petchukocov thought it irresponsible  --  reckless  --  topush his submarine so hard , even if everything were functioning properly . No Alfa plant on a submarine had ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And on this one , things were beginning to come apart . The primary high-pressure reactor coolant pump was beginning to vibrate ominously . This was particularly worrying to the engineer . There was a backup , but the secondary pump had a lower rated power , and using it meant losing eight knots of speed . The Alfa plant achieved its high power not with a sodium-cooled system  --  as the Americans thought  --  but by running at a far higher pressure than any reactor system afloat and using a revolutionary heat exchange system that boosted thep157plant 's overall thermal efficiency to forty-one percent , well in excess of that for any other submarine . But the price of this was a reactor that at full power was red-lined on every monitor gauge  --  and in this case the red lines were not mere symbolism . They signified genuine danger . This fact , added to the vibrating pump , had Petchukocov seriously concerned ; an hour earlier he had pleaded with the captain to reduce power for a few hours so that his skilled crew of engineers could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , and they had spares . The pump had been designed so that it would be easy to fix . The captain had wavered , wanting to grant the request , but the political officer had intervened , pointing out that their orders were both urgent and explicit : they had to be on station as quickly as possible ; to do otherwise would be " politically unsound . " And that was that . Petchukocov bitterly remembered the look in his captain 's eyes . What was the purpose of a commanding officer if his every order had to be approved by a political flunky ? Petchukocov had been a faithful Communistsince joining the Octobrists as a boy  --  but damn it ! what was the point of having specialists and engineers ? Did the Party really think that physical laws could be overturned by the whim of some apparatchik with a heavy desk and a dacha in the Moscow suburbs ? The engineer swore to himself . He stood alone at the master control board . This was located in the engine room , aft of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the latter placed right at the submarine 's center of gravity . The reactor was pressurized to twenty kilograms per square centimeter , about twenty-eight hundred pounds per square inch . Only a fraction of this pressure came from the pump . The higher pressure caused a higher boiling point for the coolant . In this case , the water was heated to over 900  --  Celsius , a temperature sufficient to generate steam , which gathered at the top of the reactor vessel ; the steam bubble applied pressure to the water beneath , preventing the generation of more steam . The steam and water regulated one another in a delicate balance . The water was dangerously radioactive as a result of the fission reaction taking place within the uranium fuel rods . The function of the control rods was to regulate the reaction . Again , the control was delicate . At most the rods could absorb just less than one percent of the neutron flux , but this was enough either to permit the reaction or to prevent it . Petchukocov could recite all this data in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagram of the entire engine plant from memory and could instantly grasp the significance of the slightest change in his instrument readings . He stood perfectly straight over the control board , his eyes tracing the myriad dials and gauges in a regular pattern , one handp158poised over the SCRAM switch , the other over the emergency cooling controls . He could hear the vibration . It had to be a bad bearing getting worse as it wore more and more unevenly . If the crankshaft bearings went bad , the pump would seize , and they 'd have to stop . This would be an emergency , though not really a dangerous one . It would mean that repairing the pump  --  if they could repair it at all  --  would take days instead of hours , eating up valuable time and spare parts . That was bad enough . What was worse , and what Petchukocov did not know , was that the vibration was generating pressure waves in the coolant . To make use of the newly developed heat exchanger , the Alfa plant had to move water rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-pressure pump which accounted for one hundred fifty pounds of the total system pressure  --  almost ten times what was consideredsafe in Western reactors . With the pump so powerful , the whole engine room complex , normally very noisy at high speed , was like a boiler factory , and the pump 's vibration was disturbing the performance of the monitor instruments . It was making the needles on his gauges waver , Petchukocov noted . He was right , and wrong . The pressure gauges were really wavering because of the thirty-pound overpressure waves pulsing through the system . The chief engineer did not recognize this for what itwas . He had been on duty too many hours . Within the reactor vessel , these pressure waves were approaching thefrequency at which a piece of equipment resonated . Roughly halfwaydown the interior surface of the vessel was a titanium fitting , part of the backup cooling system . In the event of a coolant loss , and after a successfulSCRAM , valves inside and outside the vessel would open , cooling the reactor either with a mixture of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seawater which could be vented in and out of the vessel  --  at the cost of ruining the entire reactor . This had been done once , and though it had been costly , the action of a junior engineer had prevented the loss of a Victor - class attack sub by catastrophic meltdown . Today the inside valve was closed , along with the corresponding through-hull fitting . The valves were made of titanium because they had to function reliably after prolonged exposure to high temperature , and also because titanium was very corrosion-resistant  --  high-temperature water was murderously corrosive . What had not been fully considered was that the metal was also exposed to intense nuclear radiation , and this particular titanium alloy was not completely stable under extended neutronbombardment . The metal had become brittle over the years . The minute waves of hydraulic pressure were beating against the clapper in the valve . As the pump 's frequency of vibration changed it began to approach the frequency at which the clapper vibrated . This caused thep159clapper to snap harder and harder against its retaining ring . The metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forward end of the compartment heard it first , a low buzz coming through the bulkhead . At first he thought it was feedback noise from the PA speaker , and he waited too long to check it . The clapper broke free and dropped out of the valve nozzle . It was not very large , only ten centimeters in diameter and five millimeters thick . This type of fitting is called a butterfly valve , and the clapper looked just like a butterfly , suspended and twirling in the water flow . If it had been made of stainless steel it would have been heavy enough to fall to the bottom of the vessel . But it was made of titanium , which was both stronger than steel and very much lighter . The coolant flow moved it up , towards the exhaust pipe . The outward-moving water carried the clapper into the pipe , which had a fifteen-centimeter inside diameter . The pipe was made of stainless steel , two-meter sections welded together for easy replacement in the cramped quarters . The clapper was borne along rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-five-degree downward turn and the clapper jammed momentarily . This blocked half of the pipe 's channel , and before the surge of pressure could dislodge the clapper too many things happened . The moving water had its own momentum . On being blocked , it generated a back-pressure wave within the pipe . Total pressurejumped momentarily to thirty-four hundred pounds . This caused the pipe to flex a few millimeters . The increased pressure , lateral displacementof a weld joint , and cumulative effect of years of high-temperature erosion of the steel damaged the joint . A hole the size of a pencil point opened . The escaping water flashed instantly into steam , setting off alarms in the reactor compartment and neighboring spaces . It ate at the remainder of the weld , rapidly expanding the failure until reactor coolant was erupting as though from a horizontal fountain . One jet of steam demolished the adjacent reactor-control wiring conduits . What had just begun was a catastrophic loss-of-coolant accident . The reactor was fully depressurized within three seconds . Its many gallons of coolant exploded into steam , seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once on the master control hoard , and in the blink of an eye Vladimir Petchukocov faced his ultimate nightmare . The engineer 's automatic trained reaction was to jam his linger on the SCRAM switch , but the steam in the reactor vessel had disabled the rod control system , and there was n't time to solve the problem . In an instant , Petchukocov knew that his ship was doomed . Next he opened the emergency coolant controls , admitting seawater into the reactor vessel . This automatically set off alarms throughout the hull . In the control room forward , the captain grasped the nature of thep160emergency at once . The Politovskiy was running at one hundred fifty meters . He had to get her to the surface immediately , and he shouted orders to blow all ballast and make full rise on the diving planes . The reactor emergency was regulated by physical laws . With no reactorcoolant to absorb the heat of the uranium rods , the nuclear reaction actually stopped  --  there was no water to attenuate the neutron flux . This was no solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to melt everything in the compartment . The cold water admitted into the vessel drew off the heat but also slowed down too many neutrons , keeping them in the reactor core . This caused a runaway reaction that generated even more heat , more than any amount of coolant could control . What had started as a loss-of-coolant accident became something worse : a cold-water accident . It was now only a matter of minutes before the entire core melted , and the Politovskiy had that long to get to the surface . Petchukocov stayed at his post in the engine room , doing what he could . His own life , he knew , was almost certainly lost . He had to give his captain time to surface the boat . There was a drill for this sort of emergency , and he barked orders to implement it . It only made things worse . His duty electrician moved along the electrical control panels switchingfrom main power to emergency , since residual steam power in the turboalternators would die in a few more seconds . In a moment the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the control room power was lost to the electrically controlled trim tabs on the trailing edge of the diving planes , which automatically switched back to electrohydraulic control . This powered not just the small trim tabs but the diving planes as well . The control assemblies moved instantly to a fifteen-degree up-angle  --  and she was still moving at thirty-nine knots . With all her ballast tanks now blasted free of water by compressed air , the submarine was very light , and she rose like a climbing aircraft . In seconds the astonished control room crew felt their boat rise to an up-angle that was forty-five degrees and getting worse . A moment later they were too busy trying to stand to come to grips with the problem . Now the Alfa was climbing almost vertically at thirty miles per hour . Every man and unsecured item aboard fell sternward . In the motor control room aft , a crewman crashed against the main electrical switchboard , short-circuiting it with his body , and all power aboard was lost . A cook who had been inventorying survival gear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fought his way into an exposure suit . Even with only a year 's experience , he was quick to understand the meaning of the hooting alarms and unprec/edented actions of his boat . He yanked the hatch shut and began to work the escape controls as he had been taught in submarine school . The Politovskiy soared through the surface of the Atlantic like a broaching whale , coming three quarters of her length out of the water before crashing back . The USS Pogy " Conn , sonar . " " Conn , aye , Captain speaking . " " Skipper , you better hear this . Something just went crazy on Bait 2 , " Pogy 's chief reported . Wood was in the sonar room in seconds , putting on earphones plugged into a tape recorder which had a two-minute offset . Commander Wood heard a whooshing sound . The engine noises stopped . A few seconds later there was an explosion of compressed air , and a staccato of hull popping noises as a submarine changed depth rapidly . " What 's going on ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Politovskiy 's reactor , the runaway fission reaction had virtually annihilated both the incoming seawater and the uranium fuel rods . Their debris settled on the after wall of the reactor vessel . In a minute there was a meter-wide puddle of radioactive slag , enough to form its own critical mass . The reaction continued unabated , this time directly attacking the tough stainless steel of the vessel . Nothing man made could long withstandfive thousand degrees of direct heat . In ten seconds the vessel wall failed . The uranium Mass dropped free , against the aft bulkhead . Petchukocov knew he was dead . He saw the paint on the forward bulkhead turn black , and his last impression was of a dark mass sur-i ounded with a blue glow . The engineer 's body vaporized an instant later , and the mass of slag dropped to the next bulkhead aft . Forward , the submarine 's nearly vertical angle in the water eased . The high-pressure air in the ballast tanks spilled out of the bottom floods and t he tanks filled with water , dropping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward part of the submarine men were screaming . The captain struggled to his feet , ignoring his broken leg , trying to get control , to get his men organized and out of the submarine before it was too late , but the luck of Evgeni Sigismondavich Politovskiy would plague his namesake one last time . Only one man escaped . The cook opened the escape trunk hatch and got out . Following what he had learned during the drill , he began to seal the hatch so that men behind him could use it , but a wave slapped him off the hull as the sub slid backwards.  |p162In  the engine room , the changing angle dropped the melted core to the deck . The hot mass attacked the steel deck first , burning through that , then the titanium of the hull . Five seconds later the engine room was vented to the sea . The Politovskiy 's largest compartment filled rapidly with water . This destroyed what little reserve buoyancy the ship had , and the acute down-angle returned . The Alfa began her last dive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his control room crew to react to orders again . His head struck an instrument console . What slim hopes his crew had died with him . The Politovskiy was falling backwards , her propeller windmilling the wrong way as she slid to the bottom of the sea . The Pogy " Skipper , I was on the Chopper back in sixty-nine , " the Pogy 's chief said , referring to a horrifying accident on a diesel-powered submarine . " That 's what it sounds like , " his captain said . He was now listening to direct sonar input . There was no mistaking it . The submarine was flooding . They had heard the ballast tanks refill ; this could only mean interior compartments were filling with water . If they had been closer , they might have heard the screams of men in that doomed hull . Wood was just as happy he could n't . The continuing rush of water was dreadful enough . Men were dying . Russians , his enemy , but men not unlike himself , and there was not a thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw , was proceeding , unmindful of what had happened to her trailing sister . The E. S. PolitovskiyIt took nine minutes for the Politovskiy to fall the two thousand feet to the ocean floor . She impacted savagely on the hard sand bottom at the edge of the continental shelf . It was a tribute to her builders that her interior bulkheads held . All the compartments from the reactor room aft were flooded and half the crew killed in them , but the forward compartments were dry . Even this was more curse than blessing . With the aft air storage banks unusable and only emergency battery power to run the complex environmental control systems , the forty men had only a limited supply of air . They were spared a rapid death from the crushing North Atlantic only to face a slower one from asphyxiation.  |p163THE  NINTH DAYSATURDAY , 11 DECEMBERThe PentagonA female yeoman first class held the door open for Tyler . He walked in to find General Harris standing alone over the large chart table pondering the placement of tiny ship models . " You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir . " Tyler was standing as rigidly at attention as his prosthetic leg allowed ! Harris came over quickly to shake hands . " Greer says you used to play ball . " " Yes , General , I played right tackle at Annapolis . Those were good years . " Tyler smiled , flexing his fingers . Harris looked like an ironpumper . " Okay , if you used to play ball , you can call me Ed . " Harris poked him in the chest . " Your number was seventy-eight , and you made All American , right ? " " Second string , sir . Nice to know somebody remembers . " " I was temporary duty at the Academy for a few months back then , and I caught a couple games . I never forget a good offensive lineman . I made All Conference at Montana  --  long time ago . What happened to the leg ? " " Drunk driver clipped me . I was the lucky one . The drunk did n't make it . " " Serves the bastard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drunken shipfitterp164had had his own wife and family , according to the police . " Where is everybody ? " " The chiefs are at their normal  --  well , normal for a weekday , not a Saturday  --  intelligence briefing . They ought to be down in a few minutes . So , you 're teaching engineering at Annapolis now , eh ? " " Yes , sir . I got a doctorate in that along the way . " " Name 's Ed , Skip . And this morning you 're going to tell us how we can hold onto that maverick Russian sub ? " " Yes , sir  --  Ed . " " Tell me about it , but let 's get some coffee first . " The two men went to a table in the corner with coffee and donuts . Harris listened to the younger man for five minutes , sipping his coffee and devouring a couple of jelly donuts . It took a lot of food to support his frame . " Son of a gun , " the J-3 observed when Tyler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's interesting . Your idea depends a lot on sleight of hand . We 'd have to keep them away from where we 're pulling this off . About here , you say ? " He tapped the chart . " Yes , General . The thing is , the way they seem to be operating we can do this to seaward of them  --  " " And do a double shuffle . I like it . Yeah , I like it , but Dan Foster wo n't like losing one of our own boats . " " I 'd say it 's worth the trade . " " So would I , " Harris agreed . " But they 're not my boats . After we do this , where do we hide her  --  if we get her ? " " General , there are some nice places right here on the Chesapeake Bay . There 's a deep spot on the York River and another on the Patuxent , both owned by the navy , both marked Keep Out on the charts . Nice thing about subs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a deep enough spot and flood your tanks . That 's temporary , of course . For a more permanent spot , maybe Truk or Kwajalein in the Pacific . Nice and far from any place . " " And the Soviets would never notice the presence of a sub tender and three hundred submarine technicians there all of a sudden ? Besides , those islands do n't really belong to us anymore , remember ? " Tyler had n't expected this man to be a dummy . " So , what if they do find out in a few months ? What will they do , announce it to the whole world ? I do n't think so . By that time we 'll have all the information we want , and we can always produce the defecting officers in a nice news conference . How would that look for them ? Anyway , it figures that after we 've had her for a while , we 'll break her up . The reactor 'll go to Idaho for tests . The missiles and warheads will get taken off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing , and the CIA , NSA , and navy will have gunfights over the crypto gear . The stripped hulk will he takenp165to a nice deep spot and scuttled . No evidence . We do n't have to keep this a secret forever , just for a few months . " Harris set his cup down . " You 'll have to forgive me for playing devil 's advocate . I see you 've thought this out . Fine , I think it 's worth a hard look . It means coordinating a lot of hardware , but it does n't really interfere with what we 're already doing . Okay , you have my vote . " The Joint Chiefs arrived three minutes later . Tyler had never seen so many stars in one room . " You wanted to see all of us , Eddie ? " Hilton asked . " Yes , General . This is Dr. Skip Tyler . " Admiral Foster came over first to take his hand . " You got us that performance data on Red October that we were just briefed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks we should hold onto her if we get her , " Harris said deadpan . " And he thinks he has a way we can do it . " " We already thought of killing the crew , " Commandant Maxwell said . " The president wo n't let us . " " Gentlemen , what if I told you that there was a way to send the crewmen home without them knowing that we have her ? That 's the issue , right ? We have to send the crewmen back to Mother Russia . I say there 's a way to do that , and the remaining question is where to hide her . " " We 're listening , " Hilton said suspiciously . " Well , sir , we 'll have to move quickly to get everything in place . We 'll need Avalon from the West Coast . Mystic is already aboard the Pigeon in Charleston . We need both of them , and we need an old boomer of our own that we can afford to do without . That 's the hardware . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we have to find her . That may be the hardest part . " " Maybe not , " Foster said . " Admiral Gallery reported this morning that Dallas may be on to her . Her report dovetails nicely with your engineering model . We 'll know more in a few days . Go on . " Tyler explained . It took ten minutes since he had to answer questions and use the chart to diagram time and space constraints . When he was finished , General Barnes was at the phone calling the commander of the Military Airlift Command . Foster left the room to call Norfolk , and Hilton was on his way to the White House . The Red OctoberExcept for those on watch , every officer was in the wardroom . Several pots of tea were on the table , all untouched , and again the door was locked . " Comrades , " Petrov reported , " the second set of badges was contaminated , worse than the first . "  |p166Ramius  noted that Petrov was rattled . It was n't the first set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third and fourth since sailing . He had chosen his ship 's doctor well . " Bad badges , " Melekhin growled . " Some bastard of a trickster in Severomorsk  --  or perhaps an imperialist spy playing a typical enemy trick on us . When they catch the son of a bitch I will shoot him myself  --  whoever he is ! This sort of thing is treasonous ! " " Regulations require that I report this , " Petrov noted . " Even though the instruments show safe levels . " " Your adherence to the rules is noted , Comrade Doctor . You have acted correctly , " Ramius said . " And now regulations stipulate that we make yet another check . Melekhin , I want you and Borodin to do it personally . First check the radiation instruments themselves . If they are working properly , we will be certain that the badges are defective  --  or have been tampered with . If so , my report on this incident will demand someone 's head . " It was not unknown for drunken shipyard workers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion there is nothing at all to concern us . If there were a leak , Comrade Melekhin would have discoveredit days ago . So . We all have work to do . " They were all back in the wardroom half an hour later . Passing crewmen noticed this , and already the whispering started . " Comrades , " Melekhin announced , " we have a major problem . " The officers , especially the younger ones , looked a little pale . On the table was a Geiger counter stripped into a score of small parts . Next to it was a radiation detector taken off the reactor room bulkhead , its inspectioncover removed . " Sabotage , " Melekhin hissed . It was a word fearsome enough to make any Soviet citizen shudder . The room went deathly still , and Ramius noted that Svyadov was holding his face under rigid control . " Comrades , mechanically speaking these instruments are quite simple . As you know , this counter has ten different settings . We can choose from ten sensitivity ranges , using the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major one . We do that by dialing this selector , which engages one of ten electrical resistors of increasing value . A child could design this , or maintain and repair it . " The chief engineer tapped the underside of the selector dial . " In this case the proper resistors have been clipped off , and new ones soldered on . Settings one to eight have the same impedance value . All of our counters were inspected by the same dockyard technician three days before we sailed . Here is his inspection sheet . " Melekhin tossed it on the table contemptuously . " Either he or another spy sabotaged this and all the other counters I 've looked at . It would have taken a skilled man no more than an hour . In the case of this instrument . " The engineer turned the fixed detector over.  | " You see that the electrical parts have been disconnected , except for the test circuit , which was rewired . Borodin and I removed this from the forward bulkhead . This is skilled work ; whoever did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent has sabotaged our ship . First he disabled our radiation monitor instruments , then he probably arranged a low-level leak in our hot piping . It would appear , comrades , that Comrade Petrov was correct . We may have a leak . My apologies , Doctor . " Petrov nodded jerkily . Compliments like this he could easily forego . " Total exposure , Comrade Petrov ? " Ramius asked . " The greatest is for the enginemen , of course . The maximum is fifty rads for Comrades Melekhin and Svyadov . The other engine crewmen run from twenty to forty-five rads , and the cumulative exposure drops rapidly as one moves forward . The torpedomen have only five rads or so , mostly less . The officers exclusive of engineers run from ten to twentyfive . " Petrov paused , telling himself to be more positive . " Comrades , these are not lethal doses . In fact , one can tolerate a dose of up to a hundred rads without any near-term physiological effects , and one can survive several hundred . We do face a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life-threatening emergency . " " Melekhin ? " the captain asked . " It is my engine plant , and my responsibility . We do not yet know that we have a leak . The badges could still be defective or sabotaged . This could all be a vicious psychological trick played on us by the main enemy to damage our morale . Borodin will assist me . We will personally repair these and conduct a thorough inspection of all reactor systems . I am too old to have children . For the moment , I suggest that we deactivate the reactor and proceed on battery . The inspection will take us four hours at most . I also recommend that we reduce reactor watches to two hours . Agreed , Captain ? " " Certainly , Comrade . I know that there is nothing you can not repair . " " Excuse me , Comrade Captain , " Ivanov spoke up . " Should we report this to fleet headquarters ? " " Our orders are not to break radio silence , " Ramius said . " If the imperialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they knew our orders beforehand and are attempting to make us use the radio so they can locate us ? " Borodin asked . " A possibility , " Ramius replied . " First we will determine if we have a problem , then its severity . Comrades , we have a fine crew and the best officers in the fleet . We will see to our own problems , conquer them , and continue our mission . We all have a date in Cuba that I intend to meet  --  to hell with imperialist plots ! " " Well said , " Melekhin concurred . " Comrades , we will keep this secret . There is no reason to excite thep168crew over what may be nothing , and at most is something we can handle on our own . " Ramius ended the meeting . Petrov was less sure , and Svyadov was trying very hard not to shake . He had a sweetheart at home and wanted one day to have children . The young lieutenant had been painstakingly trained to understand everything that went on in the reactor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awry . And it was some consolation to know that most of the solutions to reactor problems to be found in the book had been written by some of the men in this room . Even so , something that could neither be seen nor felt was invading his body , and no rational person would be happy with that . The meeting adjourned . Melekhin and Borodin went aft to the engineeringstores . A michman electrician came with them to get the proper parts . He noted that they were reading from the maintenance manual for a radiation detector . When he went off duty an hour later , the whole crew knew that the reactor had been shut down yet again . The electrician conferred with his bunkmate , a missile maintenance technician . Together they discussed the reason for working on a half dozen Geiger counters and other instruments , and their conclusion was an obvious one . The submarine 's bosun overheard the discussion and pondered the conclusion himself . He had been on nuclear submarines for ten years . Despite this he was not an educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to the left of witchcraft . It worked the ship , how he did not know , though he was certain that there was something unholy about it . Now he began to wonder if the devils he never saw inside that steel drum  --  were coming loose ? Within two hours the entire crew knew that something was wrong and that their officers had not yet figured out a way to deal with it . The cooks bringing food forward from the galley to the crew spaces were seen to linger in the bow as long as they could . Men standing watch in the control room shifted on their feet more than usual , Ramius noted , hurrying forward at the change of watch . The USS New JerseyIt took some getting used to , Commodore Zachary Eaton reflected . When his flagship was built , he was sailing boats in a bathtub . Back then the Russians were allies , but allies of convenience , who shared a common enemy instead of a common goal . Like the Chinese today , he judged . The enemy then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-sixyearcareer , he had been to both countries many times , and his first command , a destroyer , had been home-ported at Yokosuka . It was a strange world.  |p169There  were several nice things about his flagship . Big as she was , her movement on the ten-foot seas was just enough to remind him that he was at sea , not at a desk . Visibility was about ten miles , and somewhere out there , about eight hundred miles away , was the Russian fleet . His battleshipwas going to meet them just like in the old old days , as if the aircraft carrier had never come along . The destroyers Caron and Stump were in sight , five miles off the bow . Further forward , the cruisers Biddle and Wainwright were doing radar picket duty . The surface action group was marking time instead of proceeding forward as he would have preferred . Off the New Jersey coast , the helicopter assault ship Tarawa and two frigates were racing to join up , bringing ten AV-8B Harrier attack fighters . and fourteen ASW helicopters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of critical concern to Eaton . The Saratoga 's air wing was now operating out of Maine , along with a goodly collection of air force birds working hard to learn the maritime strike business . HMS Invincible was two hundred miles to his east , conducting aggressive ASW patrols , and eight hundred miles east of that force was the Kennedy , hiding under a weather front off the Azores . It slightly irked the commodore that the Brits were helping out . Since when did the U.S. Navy need help defending the American coast ? Not that they did n't owe us the favor , though . The Russians had split into three groups , with the carrier Kiev easternmostto face the Kennedy 's battle group . His expected responsibility was the Moskva group , with the Invincible handling the Kirov 's . Data on all three was being fed to him continuously and digested by his operations staff down in flag plot . What were the Soviets up to ? he wondered . He knew the stor/ that they were searching for a lost sub , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had a bridge they wanted to sell . Probably , he thought , they want to demonstrate that they can trail their coats down our coast whenever they want , to show that they have a seagoing fleet and to establish a precedent for doing this again . Eaton did not like that . He did not much care for his assigned mission either . He had two tasks that were not fully compatible . Keeping an eye on their submarine activity would be difficult enough . The Saratoga 's Vikings were not working his area , despite his request , and most of the Orions were working farther out , closer to the Invincible . His own ASW assets were barely adequate for local defense , much less active sub hunting . The Tarawa would change that , but also change his screening requirements . His other mission was to establish and maintain sensor contact with the Moskva group and to report at once any unusual activity to CINCLANTFLT , the commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet . Thisp170made sense , sort of . If their surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with them . It was being decided now how closely he should shadow them . The problem was whether he should be nearby or far away . Near meant twenty miles  --  gun range . The Moskva had ten escorts , none of which could possibly survive more than two of his sixteen-inch projectiles . At twenty miles he had the choice of using full-sized or subcaliber rounds , the latter guided to their targets by a laser designator installed atop the main director tower . Tests the previous year had determined that he could maintain a steady firing rate of one round every twenty seconds , with the laser shifting fire from one target to another until there were no more . But this would expose the New Jersey and her escorts to torpedo and missile fire from the Russian ships . Backing farther off , he could still fire sabot rounds from fifty miles , and they could be directed to the target by a laser designator aboard the battlewagon 's helicopter . This would expose the chopper to surface-toairmissile fire and to Soviet helicopters suspected of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tarawa was bringing a pair of Apache attack helicopters , which carried lasers , air-to-air missiles , and their own air-to-surface missiles ; they were antitank weapons expected to work well against small warships . His ships would be exposed to missile fire , but he did n't fear for his flagship . Unless the Russians were carrying nuclear warheads , their antiship missiles would not be able to damage his ship gravely  --  the New Jersey had upwards of a foot of class B armor plate . They would , however , play hell with his radar and communications gear , and worse , they would be lethal to his thin-hulled escorts . His ships carried their own antiship missiles , Harpoons and Tomahawks , though not as many as he would have liked . And what about a Russian sub hunting them ? Eaton had been told of none , but you never knew where one might be hiding . Oh well  --  he could n't worry about everything . A submarine could sink the New Jersey , but she would have to work at it . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd get the first shot , but Eaton would have enough warning to launch his own missiles and get off a few rounds of gunfire while calling for air support  --  none of which would happen , he was sure . He decided that the Russians were on some sort of fishing expedition . His job was to show them that the fish in these waters were dangerous . Naval Air Station , North Island , CaliforniaThe oversized tractor-trailer crept at two miles per hour into the cargo bay of the C-5A Galaxy transport under the watchful eyes of the aircraft 's loadmaster , two flight officers , and six naval officers . Oddly , only thep171latter , none of whom wore aviator 's wings , were fully versed in the procedure . The vehicle 's center of gravity was precisely marked , and they watched the mark approach a particular number engraved on the cargo hay floor . The work had to be done exactly . Any mistake could fatally impair the aircraft 's trim and imperil the lives of the flight crew and passengers . " Okay , freeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The driver was only too glad to stop . He left the keys in the ignition , set all the brakes , and put the truck in gear before getting out . Someone else would drive it out of the aircraft on the other side of the country . The loadmaster and six airmen immediately went to work , snaking steel cables to eyebolts on the truck and trailer to secure the heavy load . Shifting cargo was something else an aircraft rarely survived , and the C-5A did not have ejection seats . The loadmaster saw to it that his ground crewmen were properly at work before walking over to the pilot . He was a twenty-five-year sergeant who loved the C-5s despite their blemished history . " Cap'n , what the hell is this thing ? " " It 's called a DSRV , Sarge , deep submergence rescue vehicle . " " Says Avalon on the back , sir , " the sergeant pointed out . " Yeah , so it has a name . It 's a sort of a lifeboat for submarines . Goesdown to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh . " The sergeant considered that . He 'd flown tanks , helicopters , general cargo , once a whole battalion of troops on his  --  he thought of the aircraft as his  --  Galaxy before . This was the first time he had ever flown a ship . If it had a name , he reasoned , it was a ship . Damn , the Galaxy could do anything ! " Where we takin ' it , sir ? " " Norfolk Naval Air Station , and I 've never been there either . " The pilot watched the securing process closely . Already a dozen cables were attached . When a dozen more were in place , they 'd put tension on the cables to prevent the minutest shift . " We figure a trip of five hours , forty minutes , all on internal fuel . We got the jet stream on our side today . Weather 's supposed to be okay until we hit the coast . We lay over for a day , then come back Monday morning . " " Your boys work pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ames , coming over . " Yes , Lieutenant , another twenty minutes . " The pilot checked his watch . " We ought to be taking off on the hour . " " No hurry , Captain . If this thing shifts in flight , I guess it would ruin our whole day . Where do I send my people ? " " Upper deck forward . There 's room for fifteen or so just aft of the flight deck . " Lieutenant Ames knew this but did n't say so . He 'd flown with his DSRV across the Atlantic several times and across the Pacific once , every time on a different C-5.  | " May I ask what the big deal is ? " the pilot inquired . " I do n't know , " Ames said . " They want me and my baby in Norfolk . " " You really take that little bitty thing underwater , sir ? " the loadmasterasked . " That 's what they pay me for . I 've had her down to forty-eight hundred feet , almost a mile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile under water , sir ? Jesus  --  uh , pardon me , sir , but I mean , is n't that a little hairy  --  the water pressure , I mean ? " " Not really . I 've been down to twenty thousand aboard Trieste . It 's really pretty interesting down there . You see all kinds of strange fish . " Though a fully qualified submariner , Ames ' first love was research . He had a degree in oceanography and had commanded or served in all of the navy 's deep-submergence vehicles except the nuclear-powered NR-1 . " Of course , the water pressure would do bad things to you if anything went wrong , but it would be so fast you 'd never know it . If you fellows want a check ride , I could probably arrange it . It 's a different world down there . " " That 's okay , sir . " The sergeant went back to swearing at his men . " You were n't serious , " the pilot observed . " Why not ? It 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and believe me , it 's a lot less hairy than riding this damned white whale during a midair refueling . " " Uh-huh , " the pilot noted dubiously . He 'd done hundreds of those . It was entirely routine , and he was surprised that anyone would find it dangerous . You had to be careful , of course , but , hell , you had to be careful driving every morning . He was sure that an accident on this pocket submarine would n't leave enough of a man to make a decent meal for a shrimp . It takes all kinds , he decided . " You do n't go to sea by yourself in that , do you ? " " No , ordinarily we work off a submarine rescue ship , Pigeon or Ortolan . We can also operate off a regular submarine . That gadget you see there on the trailer is our mating collar . We can nest on the back of a sub at the after escape trunk , and the sub takes us where we need to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the East Coast ? " " That 's a good bet , but nobody 's said anything official to us . The papers say the Russians have lost a sub . If so , we might go down to look at her , maybe rescue any survivors . We can take off twenty or twenty-five men at a time , and our mating collar is designed to fit Russian subs as well as our own . " " Same size ? " " Close enough . " Ames cocked an eyebrow . " We plan for all kinds of contingencies . " " Interesting . "  |p173The  North AtlanticThe YAK-36 Forger had left the Kiev half an hour before , guided first by gyro compass and now by the ESM pod on the fighter 's stubby rudder fin . Senior Lieutenant Viktor Shavrov 's mission was not an easy one . He was to approach the American E-3A Sentry radar surveillance aircraft , one of which had been shadowing his fleet for three days now . The AWACS ( airborne warning and control system ) aircraft had been careful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to maintain constantcoverage of the Soviet fleet , reporting every maneuver and radio transmission to their command base . It was like having a burglar watchingone 's apartment and being unable to do anything about it . Shavrov 's mission was to do something about it . He could n't shoot , of course . His orders from Admiral Stralbo on the Kirov had been explicit about that . But he was carrying a pair of Atoll heat-seeking missiles which he would be sure to show the imperialists . He and his admiral expected that this would teach them a lesson : the Soviet Navy did not like having imperialist snoopers about , and accidents had been known to happen . It was a mission worthy of the effort it took . This effort was considerable . To avoid detection by the airborne radar Shavrov had to fly as low and slow as his fighter could operate , a bare twenty meters above the rough Atlantic ; this way he would get lost in the sea return . His speed was two hundred knots . This made for excellent fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his fuel load . It also made for very rough flying as his fighter bounced through the roiled air at the wave tops . There was a low-hanging mist that cut visibility to a few kilometers . So much the better , he thought . The nature of the mission had chosen him , rather than the other way around . He was one of the few Soviet pilots experienced in low-level flying . Shavrov had not become a sailor-pilot by himself . He 'd started flying attack helicopters for frontal aviation in Afghanistan , graduating to fixed-wing aircraft after a year 's bloody apprenticeship . Shavrov was an expert in nap-of-the-earth flying , having learned it by necessity , hunting the bandits and **26;12190;TOOLONG hid in the towering mountains like hydrophobic rats . This skill had made him attractive to the fleet , which had transferred him to sea duty without his having had much say in the matter . After a few months he had no complaints , his perqs and extra pay being more attractive than his former frontal aviation base on the Chinese border . Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow of missing his chance to fly the new MiG-27 , though with luck , if the new full-sized carrier were ever finished , he 'd have the chance to fly the naval version of that wonderful bird . Shavrov could wait for that , and with a few successful missions like this one he might have his squadron command.  |p174He  stopped daydreaming  --  the mission was too demanding for that . This was real flying . He 'd never flown against Americans , only against the weapons they gave to the Afghan bandits . He had lost friends to those weapons , some of whom had survived their crashes only to be done to death by the Afghan savages in ways that would have made even a German puke . It would be good to teach the imperialists a lesson personally . The radar signal was growing stronger . Beneath his ejection seat a tape recorder was making a continuous record of the signal characteristics of the American aircraft so that the scientific people would be able to devise a means of jamming and foiling the vaunted American flying eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorified passenger plane , hardly a worthy opponent for a crack fighter pilot ! Shavrov checked his chart . He 'd have to find it soon . Next he checked his fuel . He 'd dropped his last external tank a few minutes earlier , and all he had now was his internal fuel . The turbofan was guzzling fuel , something he had to keep an eye on . He planned to have only five or ten minutes of fuel left when he returned to his ship . This did not trouble him . He already had over a hundred carrier landings . There ! His hawk 's eyes caught the glint of sun off metal at one o'clock high . Shavrov eased back on his stick and increased power gently , bringing his Forger into a climb . A minute later he was at two thousand meters . He could see the Sentry now , its blue paint blending neatly into the darkening sky . He was coming up beneath its tail , and with luck the empennage would shield him from the rotating radar antenna . Perfect ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight crew see his Atolls , andIt took Shavrov a moment to realize that he had a wingman . Two wingmen . Fifty meters to his left and right , a pair of American F-15 Eagle fighters . The visored face of one pilot was staring at him . " YAK-106 , YAK-106 , please acknowledge . " The voice on his SSB ( single side band ) radio circuit spoke flawless Russian . Shavrov did not acknowledge . They had read the number off his engine intake housing before he had known they were there. " 106 , 106 , this is the Sentry aircraft you are now approaching . Please identify yourself and your intentions . We get a little anxious when a stray fighter comes our way , so we 've had three following you for the past hundred kilometers . " Three ? Shavrov turned his head around . A third Eagle with four Sparrow missiles was hanging fifty meters from his tail , his " six . " " Our men compliment you on your ability to fly low and slow , 106 . " Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still eight thousand from the American AWACS . He had checked his six every thirty seconds on the way in . The Americans must have been riding back there , hidden in the mist , and vectored in on him Icy instructions from the Sentry . He swore to himself and held course . I le 'd teach that AWACS a lesson ! " Break off , 106 . " It was a cool voice , without emotion except perhaps a trace of irony . " 106 , if you do not break off , we will consider your mission to be hostile . Think about it , 106 . You are beyond radar coverage of your own ships , and you are not yet within missile range of us . " Shavrov looked to his right . The Eagle was breaking off  --  so was the one to the left . Was it a gesture , taking the heat off of him and expecting some courtesy in return ? Or were they clearing the way for the one behind him  --  he checked , still there  --  to shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ; he was at least a minute from the fringe of their missile range . Shavrov was anything but a coward . Neither was he a fool . He moved his stick , curving his fighter a few degrees to the right . " Thank you , 106 , " the voice acknowledged . " You see , we have some trainee operators aboard . Two of them are women , and we do n't want them to get rattled their first time out . " Suddenly it was too much . Shavrov thumbed the radio switch on his stick . " Shall I tell you what you can do with your women , Yankee ? " " You are nekulturny , 106 , " the voice replied softly . " Perhaps the long overwater flight has made you nervous . You must be about at the limit of your internal fuel . Bastard of a day to fly , what with all these crazy , shifting winds . Do you need a position check , over ? " " Negative , Yanlee ! " " Course back to Kiev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magnetic compass this far north , you know . Distance to Kiev is 318.6 kilometers . Warning  --  there is a rapidly moving cold front coming in from the southwest . That 's going to make flying a little rough in a few hours . Do you require an escort back to Kiev ? " " Pig ! " Shavrov swore to himself . He switched his radio off , cursing himself for his lack of discipline . He had allowed the Americans to wound his pride . Like most fighter pilots , he had a surfeit of that. " 106 , we did not copy your last transmission . Two of my Eagles are heading that way . They will form up on you and see that you get home safely . Have a happy day , Comrade . Sentry-November , out . " The American lieutenant turned to his colonel . He could n't keep a straight face any longer . " God , I thought I 'd strangle talking like that ! " He sipped some Coke from a plastic cup . " He really thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't notice , he did get within a mile of Atoll range , and we do n't have authorization to shoot at him until he flips one at us  --  which might wreck our day , " the colonel grumped . " Nice job of twisting his tail , Lieutenant . " " A pleasure , Colonel . " The operator looked at his screen . " Well , he 's heading back to momma , with Cobras 3 and 4 on his six . He 's going to be one unhappy Russkie when he gets home . If he gets home . Even with those drop tanks , he must be near his range limit . " He thought for a moment . " Colonel , if they do this again , how ' bout we offer to take the guy home with us ? " " Get a Forger  --  what for ? I suppose the navy 'd like to have one to play with , they do n't get much of Ivan 's hardware , but the Forger 's a piece of junk . " Shavrov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd already shown enough personal weakness for one day . Besides , his YAK could only break Mach 1 in a dive . Those Eagles could do it straight up , and they had plenty of fuel . He saw that they both carried FAST-pack conformal fuel cells . They could cross whole oceans with those . Damn the Americans and their arrogance ! Damn his own intelligence officer for telling him he could sneak up on the Sentry ! Let the air-to-air armed Backfires go after them . They could handle that damned overbred passengerbus , could get to it faster than its fighter guardians could react . The Americans , he saw , were not lying about the weather front . A line of cold weather squalls racing northeast was just on the horizon as he approached the Kiev . The Eagles backed off as he approached the formation . One American pilot pulled alongside briefly to wave goodbye . His head bobbed at Shavrov 's return gesture . The Eagles paired up and turned back north . Five minutes later he was aboard the Kiev , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocked he jumped to the carrier deck , stomping off to see his squadron commander . The KremlinThe city of Moscow was justly famous for its subway system . For a pittance , people could ride nearly anywhere they wanted on a modern , safe , garishly decorated electric railway system . In case of war , the underground tunnels could serve as a bomb shelter for the citizens of Moscow . This secondary use was the result of the efforts of Nikita Khrushchev , who when construction was begun in the mid-thirties had suggested to Stalin that the system be driven deep . Stalin had approved . The shelter consideration had been decades ahead of its time ; nuclear fission had then only been a theory , fusion hardly thought of at all . On a spur of the line running from Sverdlov Square to the old airport ,  |p177which  ran near the Kremlin , workers bored a tunnel that was later closed off with a ten-meter-thick steel and concrete plug . The hundred-meterlongspace was connected to the Kremlin by a pair of elevator shafts , and over time it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Politburo could control the entire Soviet empire . The tunnel was also a convenient means of going unseen from the city to a small airport from which Politburo members could be flown to their ultimate redoubt , beneath the granite monolith at Zhiguli . Neither command post was a secret to the West  --  both had existed far too long for that  --  but the KGB confidently reported that nothing in the Western arsenals could smash through the hundreds of feet of rock which in both places separated the Politburo from the surface . This fact was of little comfort to Admiral Yuri Ilych Padorin . He found himself seated at the far end of a ten-meter-long conference table looking at the grim faces of the ten Politburo members , the inner circle that alone made the strategic decisions affecting the fate of his country . None of them were officers . Those in uniform reported to these men . Up the table to his left was Admiral Sergey Gorshkov , who had disassociated himself from this affair with consummate skill , even producing a letter in which he had opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as chief of the Main Political Administration , had successfully blocked Ramius ' transfer , pointing out that Gorshkov 's candidate for command was occasionally late in paying his Party dues and did not speak up at the regular meetings often enough for an officer of his rank . The truth was that Gorshkov 's candidate was not so proficient an officer as Ramius , whom Gorshkov had wanted for his own operations staff , a post that Ramius had successfully evaded for years . Party General Secretary and President of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Andre Narmonov shifted his gaze to Padorin . His face gave nothing away . It never did , unless he wished it to  --  which was rare enough . Narmonov had succeeded Andropov when the latter had suffered a heart attack . There were rumors about that , but in the Soviet Union there are always rumors . Not since the days of Laventri Beria had the security chieftain come so close to power , and senior Party officials had allowed themselves to forget that . It would not be forgotten again . Bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary measure to secure the privileges of the Party elite from the supposed reforms of the Andropov clique . Narmonov was the apparatchik par excellence . He had first gained prominence as a factory manager , an engineer with a reputation for fulfilling his quota early , a man who produced results . He had risen steadily by using his own talents and those of others , rewarding those he had to , ignoring those he could . His position as general secretary of thep178Communist Party was not entirely secure . It was still early in his stewardshipof the Party , and he depended on a loose coalition of colleagues  --  not friends , these men did not make friends . His succession to this chair had resulted more from ties within the Party structure than from personal ability , and his position would depend on consensus rule for years , until such time as his will could dictate policy . Narmonov 's dark eyes , Padorin could see , were red from tobacco smoke . The ventilation system down here had never worked properly . The general secretary squinted at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided what to say , what would please the members of this cabal , these ten old , passionless men . " Comrade Admiral , " he began coldly , " we have heard from Comrade Gorshkov what the chances are of finding and destroying this rebellious submarine before it can complete its unimaginable crime . We are not pleased . Nor are we pleased with the fantastic error in judgment that gave command of our most valuable ship to this slug . What I want to know from you , Comrade , is what happened to the zampolit aboard , and what security measures were taken by your office to prevent this infamy from taking place ! " There was no fear in Narmonov 's voice , but Padorin knew it had to be there . This " fantastic error " could ultimately be laid at the chairman 's feet by members who wanted another in that chair  --  unless he were able somehow to separate himself from it . If this meant Padorin 's skin , that was the admiral 's problem . Narmonov had had men flayed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a man who had lived through months of intensive combat operations and had several boats sunk from under him . If his body was softer now , his mind was not . Whatever his fate might be , Padorin was determined to meet it with dignity . If they remember me as a fool , he thought , it will be as a courageous fool . He had little left to live for in any case . " Comrade General Secretary , " he began , " the political officer aboard Red October was Captain Ivan Yurievich Putin , a stalwart and faithful Party member . I can not imagine  --  " " Comrade Padorin , " Defense Minister Ustinov interrupted , " we presumethat you also could not imagine the unbelievable treachery of this Ramius . You now expect us to trust your judgment on this man also ? " " The most disturbing thing of all , " added Mikhail Alexandrov , the Party theoretician who had replaced the dead Mikhail Suslov and was even more determined than the departed ideologue to be simon-pure on Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been toward this renegade . It is amazing , particularly in view of his obvious efforts to construct his own personality cult throughout the submarine service , even in the political arm , it would seem . Your crimi/nal willingness to overlook this  --  this obvious aberration from Party policy  --  does not make your judgment appear very sound . " " Comrades , you are correct in judging that I erred badly in approving Ramius for command , and also that we allowed him to select most of Red October 's senior officers . At the same time , we chose some years ago to do things in this way , to keep officers associated with a single ship for many years , and to give the captain great sway over their careers . This is an operational question , not a political one . " " We have already considered that , " Narmonov replied . " It is true that in this case there is enough blame for more than one man . " Gorshkov did n't move , but the message was explicit : his effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't care how many heads it took to prop up his chair . " Comrade Chairman , " Gorshkov objected , " the efficiency of the fleet  --  " " Efficiency ? " Alexandrov said . " Efficiency . This Lithuanian halfbreedis efficiently making fools of our fleet with his chosen officers while our remaining ships blunder about like newly castrated cattle . " Alexandrovalluded to his first job on a state farm . A fitting beginning , it was generally thought , for the man who held the position of chief ideologue was as popular in Moscow as the plague , but the Politburo had to have him or one like him . The ideological chieftain was always the kingmaker . Whose side was he on now  --  in addition to his own ? " The most likely explanation is that Putin was murdered , " Padorin continued . " He alone of the officers left behind a wife and family . " " That 's another question , Comrade Admiral . " Narmonov seized this issue . " Why is it that none of these men are married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Politburo supervise everything ? Ca n't you think for yourselves ? " As if you want us to , Padorin thought . " Comrade General Secretary , most of our submarine commanders prefer young , unmarried officers in their wardrooms . Duty at sea is demanding , and single men have fewer distractions . Moreover , each of the senior officers aboard is a Party member in good standing with a praiseworthy record . Ramius has been treacherous , there is no denying that , and I would gladly kill the son of a hitch with my own hands  --  but he has deceived more good men than there are in this room . " " Indeed , " Alexandrov observed . " And now that we are in this mess , how do we get out of it ? " Padorin took a deep breath . He 'd been waiting for this . " Comrades , we have another man aboard Red October , unknown to either Putin or Captain Ramius , an agent of the Main Political Administration . " " What ? " Gorshkov said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  |p180Alexandrov  smiled . " That 's the first intelligent thing we 've heard today . Go on . " " This individual is covered as an enlisted man . He reports directly to our office , bypassing all operational and political channels . His name is Igor Loginov . He is twenty-four , a  --  " " Twenty-four ! " Narmonov shouted . " You trust a child with this re-sponsibility ? " " Comrade , Loginov 's mission is to blend in with the conscripted crewmen , to listen in on conversations , to identify likely traitors , spies , and saboteurs . In truth he looks younger still . He serves alongside young men , and he must be young himself . He is , in fact , a graduate of the higher naval school for political officers at Kiev and the GRU intelligence academy . He is the son of Arkady Ivanovich Loginov , chief of the Lenin Steel Plant at Kazan . Many of you here know his father . " Narmonov was among those who nodded , a flickering of interest in his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have met and interviewed this boy myself . His record is clear , he is a Soviet patriot without question . " " I know his father , " Narmonov confirmed . " Arkady Ivanovich is an honorable man who has raised several good sons . What are this boy 's orders ? " " As I said , Comrade General Secretary , his ordinary duties are to observe the crewmen and report on what he sees . He 's been doing this for two years , and he is good at it . He does not report to the zampolit aboard , but only to Moscow or to one of my representatives . In a genuine emergency , his orders are to report to the zampolit . If Putin is alive  --  and I do not believe this , comrades  --  he would be part of the conspiracy , and Loginov would know not to do this . In a true emergency , therefore , his orders are to destroy the ship and make his escape . " " This is possible ? " Narmonov asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry powerful scuttling charges , submarinesespecially . " " Unfortunately , " Padorin said , " these are generally not armed , and only the captain can activate them . Ever since the incident on Storozhevoy , we in the Main Political Administration have had to consider that an incident such as this one was indeed a possibility , and that its most damaging manifestation would involve a missile-carrying submarine . " " Ah , " Narmonov observed , " he is a missile mechanic . " " No , Comrade , he is a ship 's cook , " Padorin replied . " Wonderful ! He spends all his day boiling potatoes ! " Narmonov 's hands flew up in the air , his hopeful demeanor gone in an instant , replaced with palpable wrath . " You wish your bullet now , Padorin ? " " Comrade Chairman , this is a better cover assignment than you may imagine . " Padorin did not flinch , wanting to show these men what he wasp181made of . " On Red October the officers ' accommodations and galley are aft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there since they do not have a separate messroom  --  with the missile room in between . As a cook he must travel back and forth many times each day , and his presence in any particular area will not be thought unusual . The food freezer is located adjacent to the lower missile deck forward . It is not our plan that he should activate the scuttling charges . We have allowed for the possibilitythat the captain could disarm them . Comrades , these measures have been carefully thought out . " " Go on , " Narmonov grunted . " As Comrade Gorshkov explained earlier , Red October carries twenty-six Seahawk missiles . These are solid-fuel rockets , and one has a range-safety package installed . " " Range safety ? " Narmonov was puzzled . Up to this point the other military officers at the meeting , none of them Politburo members , had kept their peace . Padorin was surprised when General V. M. Vishenkov , commander of the Strategic Rocket Forces , spoke up . " Comrades , these details were worked out through my office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test our missiles , we have safety packages aboard to explode them if they go off course . Otherwise they might land on one of our own cities . Our operational missiles do not ordinarily carry them  --  for the obvious reason , the imperialists might learn a way to explode them in flight . " " So , our young GRU comrade will blow up the missile . What of the warheads ? " Narmonov asked . An engineer by training , he could always he distracted by a technical discourse , always impressed by a clever one . " Comrade , " Vishenkov went on , " the missile warheads are armed by accelerometers . Thus they can not be armed until the missile reaches its full programmed speed . The Americans use the same system , and for the same reason , to prevent sabotage . These safety systems are absolutely reliable . You could drop one of the reentry vehicles from the top of the Moscow television transmitter onto a steel plate and it would not fire . " The general referred to the massive TV tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **25;12218;TOOLONG . Vishenkov was a skilled political operator . " In the case of a solid-fuel rocket , " Padorin continued , recognizing his debt to Vishenkov , wondering what he 'd ask for in return , and hoping he 'd live long enough to deliver , " a safety package ignites all of , the missile 's three stages simultaneously . " " So the missile just takes off ? " Alexandrov asked . " No , Comrade Academician . The upper stage might , if it could break through the missile tube hatch , and this would flood the missile room , sinking the submarine . But even if it did not , there is sufficient thermalp182energy in either of the first two stages to reduce the entire submarine to a puddle of molten iron , twenty times what is necessary to sink it . Loginov has been trained to bypass the alarm system on the missile tube hatch , to activate the safety package , set a timer , and escape . " " Not just to destroy the ship ? " Narmonov asked . " Comrade General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to ask a young man to do his duty , knowing that it means certain death . We would be unrealistic to expect this . He must have at least the possibility of escape , otherwise human weakness might lead to failure . " " This is reasonable , " Alexandrov said . " Young men are motivated by hope , not fear . In this case , young Loginov would hope for a considerable reward . " " And get it , " Narmonov said . " We will make every effort to save this young man , Gorshkov . " " If he is truly reliable , " Alexandrov noted . " I know that my life depends on this , Comrade Academician , " Padorinsaid , his back still straight . He did not get a verbal answer , only nods from half the heads at the table . He had faced death before and was at the age where it remains the last thing a man need face . The White HouseArbatov came into the Oval Office at 4:50 P.M. He found the president and Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's desk . " Come on over , Alex . Coffee ? " The president pointed to a tray on the corner of his desk . He was not drinking today , Arbatov noted . " No , thank you , Mr. President . May I ask  --  " " We think we found your sub , Alex , " Pelt answered . " They just brought these dispatches over , and we 're checking them now . " The adviser held up a ring binder of message forms . " Where is it , may I ask ? " The ambassador 's face was deadpan . " Roughly three hundred miles northeast of Norfolk . We have not located it exactly . One of our ships noted an underwater explosion in the area  --  no , that 's not right . It was recorded on a ship , and when the tapes were checked a few hours later , they thought they heard a submarine explode and sink . Sorry , Alex , " Pelt said . " I should have known better than to read through all this stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own language , too ? " " Officers do not like for civilians to understand them , " Arbatov smiled . " This has doubtless been true since the first man picked up a stone . " " Anyway , we have ships and aircraft searching the area now . " The president looked up . " Alex , I talked to the chief of naval opera/Lions , Dan Foster , a few minutes ago . He said not to expect any survivors . The water there 's over a thousand feet deep , and you know what the weather is like . They said it 's right on the edge of the continental shelf . " " The Norfolk Canyon , sir , " Pelt added . " We are conducting a thorough search , " the president continued . " The navy is bringing in some specialized rescue equipment , search gear , all that sort of thing . If the submarine is located , we 'll get somebody down to them on the chance there might be survivors . From what the CNO tells me it is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulkheads , I think he called them  --  are intact . The other question is their air supply , he said . Time is very much against us , I 'm afraid . All this fantastically expensive equipment we buy them , and they ca n't locate one damned object right off our coast . " Arbatov made a mental record of these words . It would make a worthwhile intelligence report . The president occasionally let " By the way , Mr. Ambassador , what exactly was your submarine doing there ? " " I have no idea , Dr. Pelt . " " I trust it was not a missile sub , " Pelt said . " We have an agreement to keep those five hundred miles offshore . The wreck will of course be inspected by our rescue craft . Were we to learn that it is indeed a missile sub ... " " Your point is noted . Still , those are international waters . " The president turned and spoke softly . " So is the Gulf of Finland , Alex , and , I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang in the air for a moment . " I sincerely hope that we are not heading back to that kind of situation . Are we talking about a missile submarine , Alex ? " " Truly , Mr. President , I have no idea . Certainly I should hope not . " The president could see how carefully the lie was phrased . He wondered if the Russians would admit that there was a captain out there who had disregarded his orders . No , they would probably claim a navigation error . " Very well . In any case , we will be conducting our own search and rescue operation . We 'll know soon enough what sort of vessel we 're talking about . " The president looked suddenly uneasy . " One more thing Foster talked about . If we find bodies  --  pardon the crudity on a Saturday afternoon  --  I expect that you will want them returned to your country . " " I have had no instructions on this , " the ambassador answered truthfully , caught off guard . " It was explained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does to a man . In simple terms , they 're crushed by the water pressure , not a very pretty thing to see , they tell me . But they were men , and they deserve some dignity even in death . "  |p184Arbatov  conceded the point . " If this is possible , then , I believe that the Soviet people would appreciate this humanitarian gesture . " " We 'll do our best . " And the American best , Arbatov remembered , included a ship named the Glomar Explorer . This notorious exploration ship had been built by the CIA for the specific purpose of recovering a Soviet Golf-class missile submarine from the floor of the Pacific Ocean . She had been placed in storage , no doubt to await the next such opportunity . There would be nothing the Soviet Union could do to prevent the operation , a few hundred miles off the American coast , three hundred miles from the United States ' largest naval base . " I trust that the precepts of international law will be observed , gentlemen . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew 's bodies . " " Of course , Alex . " The president smiled , gesturing to a memorandum on his desk . Arbatov struggled for control . He 'd been led down this path like a schoolboy , forgetting that the American president had been a skilled courtroom tactician  --  not something that life in the Soviet Union prepares a man for  --  and knew all about legal tricks . Why was this bastard so easy to underestimate ? The president was also struggling to control himself . It was not often that he saw Alex flustered . This was a clever opponent , not easily caught off balance . Laughing would spoil it . The memorandum from the attorney general had arrived only that morning . It read : Mr. President , Pursuant to your request , I have asked the chief of our admiralty law departmentto review the question of international law regarding the ownershipof sunken or derelict vessels , and the law of salvage pertaining to such vessels . There is a good deal of case law on the subject . One simple example is Dalmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1949 ) : No problem of foreign law is here involved , for it is well settled that " salvage is a question arising out of the jus gentium and does not ordinarilydepend on the municipal law of particular countries . " The international basis for this is the Salvage Convention of 1910 ( Brussels ) , which codified the transnational nature of admiralty and salvage law . This was ratified by the United States in the Salvage Act of 1912 , 37 Stat. 242 , ( 1912 ) , 46 U.S.C.A.  --   --  727-731 ; and also in 37 Stat. 1658 ( 1913 ) . " International law will be observed , Alex , " the president promised . " In all particulars . " And whatever we get , he thought , will be taken to the nearest port , Norfolk , where it will be turned over to the receiver ofp185wrecks , an overworked federal official . If the Soviets want anything back , they can bring action in admiralty court , which means the federal district court sitting in Norfolk , where , if the suit were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined , and after the U.S. Navy was paid a proper fee for its salvage effort , also determined by the court  --  the wreck would be returned to its rightful owners . Of course , the federal district court in question had , at last check , an eleven-month backlog of casesArbatov would cable Moscow on this . For what good it would do . He was certain the president would take perverse pleasure in manipulating the grotesque American legal system to his own advantage , all the time pointing out that , as president , he was constitutionally unable to interfere with the working of the courts . Pelt looked at his watch . It was about time for the next surprise . He had to admire the president . For a man with only limited knowledge of international affairs only a few years earlier , he 'd learned fast . This outwardly simple , quiet-talking man was at his best in face to face situations , and after a lifetime 's experience as a prosecutor , he still loved to play the game of negotiation and tactical exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill . The phone rang and Pelt got it , right on cue . " This is Dr. Pelt speaking . Yes , Admiral  --  where ? When ? Just one ? I see . . . Norfolk ? Thank you , Admiral , that is very good news . I will inform the president immediately . Please keep us advised . " Pelt turned around . " We got one , alive , by God ! " " A survivor off the lost sub ? " The president stood . " Well , he 's a Russian sailor . A helicopter picked him up an hour ago , and they 're flying him to the Norfolk base hospital . They picked him up 290 miles northeast of Norfolk , so I guess that makes it fit . The men on the ship say he 's in pretty bad shape , but the hospital is ready for him . " The president walked to his desk and lifted the phone . " Grace , ring me Dan Foster right now . . . Admiral , this is the president . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another two hours ? " He grimaced . " Admiral , you get on the phone to the naval hospital , and you tell them that I say they are to do everything they can for that man . I want him treated like he was my own son , is that clear ? Good . I want hourly reports on his condition . I want the best people we have in on this , the very best . Thank you , Admiral . " He hung up . " All right ! " " Maybe we were too pessimistic , Alex , " Pelt chirped up . " Will we be allowed to see our man ? " Arbatov asked at once . " Certainly , " the president answered . " You have a doctor at theembassy , do n't you ? " " Yes , we do , Mr. President . "  | " Take him down , too . He 'll be extended every courtesy . I 'll see to that . Jeff , are they searching for other survivors ? " " Yes , Mr. President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and two more ships on the way . " " Good ! " The president clapped his hands together , enthusiastic as a kid in a toystore . " Now , if we can find some more survivors , maybe we can give your country a meaningful Christmas present , Alex . We will do everything we can , you have my word on that . " " That is very kind of you , Mr. President . I will communicate this happy news to my country at once . " " Not so fast , Alex . " The chief executive held his hand up . " I 'd say this calls for a drink . "  |p187THE  TENTH DAYSUNDAY , 12 DECEMBERSOS US ControlAt SOSUS Control in Norfolk , the picture was becoming increasingly difficult . The United States simply did not have the technology to keep track of submarines in the deep ocean basins . The SOSUS receptors were principally laid at shallow-water choke points , on the bottom of undersea ridges and highlands . The strategy of the NATO countries was a direct consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviets , NATO would use the Greenland  --  Iceland  --  United Kingdom SOSUS barrier as a huge tripwire , a burglar alarm system . Allied submarinesand ASW patrol aircraft would try to seek out , attack , and destroy Soviet submarines as they approached it , before they could cross the lines . The barrier had never been expected to halt more than half of the attacking submarines , however , and those that succeeded in slipping through would have to be handled differently . The deep ocean basins were simply too wide and too deep  --  the average depth was over two miles  --  to be littered with sensors as the shallow choke points were . This was a fact that cut both ways . The NATO mission would be to maintain the Atlantic Bridge and continue transoceanic trade , and the obvious Soviet mission would be to interdict this trade . Submarines would have to spread out over the vast ocean to cover the many possible convoy routes . NATO strategy behind the SOSUS barriers , then , was to assemble large convoys , each ringed with destroyers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish a protective bubble about a hundred miles across . Enemy submarines would not be able to exist within that bubble ; if in it they would be hunted down and killed  --  or merely driven off long enough for the convoy to speed past . Thus while SOSUS was designed to neutralize a huge , fixed expanse of sea , deepbasinstrategy was founded on mobility , a moving zone of protection for the vital North Atlantic shipping . This was an altogether sensible strategy , but one that could not be tested under realistic conditions , and , unfortunately , one that was largely useless at the moment . With all of the Soviet Alfas and Victors already on the coast , and the last of the Charlies , Echoes , and Novembers just arriving on their stations , the master screen Commander Quentin was staring at was no longer filled with discrete little red dots but rather with large circles . Each dot or circle designated the position of a Soviet submarine . A circle represented an estimated position , calculated from the speed with which a sub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the many sensors being employed . Some circles were ten miles across , some as much as fifty ; an area anywhere from seventy-eight to two thousand square miles had to be searched if the submarine were again to be pinned down . And there were just too damned many of the boats . Hunting the submarines was principally the job of the P-3C Orion . Each Orion carried sonobuoys , air-deployable active and passive sonar sets that were dropped from the belly of the aircraft . On detecting something , a sonobuoy reported to its mother aircraft and then automaticallysank lest it fall into unfriendly hands . The sonobuoys had limited electrical power and thus limited range . Worse , their supply was finite . The sonobuoy inventory was already being depleted alarmingly , and soon they would have to cut back on expenditures . Additionally , each P-3C carried FLIRs , forward-looking infrared scanners , to identify the heat signature of a nuclear sub , and MADs , magnetic anomaly detectors that located the disturbance in the earth 's magnetic field caused by a large chunk of ferrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magnetic disturbance six hundred yards to the left and right of an aircraft'scourse track , and to do this the aircraft had to fly low , consuming fuel and limiting the crew 's visual search range . FLIR had roughly the same limitation . Thus the technology used to localize a target first detected by SOSUS , or to " delouse " a discrete piece of ocean preparatory to the passage of a convoy , simply was not up to a random search of the deep ocean . Quentin leaned forward . A circle had just changed to a dot . A P-3C had just dropped an explosive sounding charge and localized an Echo/class attack sub five hundred miles south of the Grand Banks . For an hour they had a near-certain shooting solution on that Echo ; her name was written on the Orion 's Mark 46 ASW torpedoes . Quentin sipped at his coffee . His stomach rebelled at the additional caffeine , remembering the abuse of four months of hellish chemotherapy . If there were to be a war , this was one way it might start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps just like this . Not sneaking to kill convoys in midocean but attacking them closer to shore , the way the Germans had done . . . and all the American sensors would be in the wrong place . Once stopped the dots would grow to circles , ever wider , making the task of finding the subs all the more difficult . Their engines quiet , the boats would be invisible traps for the passing merchant vessels and warships racing to bring life-saving supplies to the men in Europe . Submarines were like cancer . Just like the disease that he had only barely defeated . The invisible , malignant vessels would find a place , stop to infect it , and on his screen the malignancies would grow until they were attacked by the aircraft he controlled from this room . But he could not attack them now . Only watch . " PK EST 1 HOUR  --  RUN , " he typed into his computer console . " 23 , " the computer answered at once . Quentin grunted . Twenty-four hours earlier the PK , probability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kills in the first hour after getting a shooting authorization . Now it was barely half that , and this number had to be taken with a large grain of salt , since it assumed that everything would work , a happy state of affairs found only in fiction . Soon , he judged , the number would be under ten . This did not include kills from friendly sbmarines that were trailing the Russians under strict orders not to reveal their positions . His sometime allies in the Sturgeons , Permits , and Los Angeleses were playing their own ASW game by their own set of rules . A different breed . He tried to think of them as friends , but it never quite worked . In his twenty years of naval service submarines had always been the enemy . In war they would be useful enemies , but in a war it was widely recognized that there was no such thing as a friendly submarine . A B-52The bomber crew knew exactly where the Russians were . Navy Orions and air force Sentries had been shadowing them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been told , the Soviets had sent an armed fighter from the Kiev to the nearest Sentry . Possibly an attack mission , probably not , it had in any case been a provocation . Four hours earlier the squadron of fourteen had flown out of Plattsburg , New York , at 0330 , leaving behind black trails of exhaust smokep190hidden in the predawn gloom . Each aircraft carried a full load of fuel and twelve missiles whose total weight was far less than the - 52 's design bombload . This made for good , long range . Which was exactly what they needed . Knowing where the Russians were was only half the battle . Hitting them was the other . The mission profile was simple in concept , rather more difficult in execution . As had been learned in missions over Hanoi  --  in which the B-52 had participated and sustained SAM ( surface-to-air missile ) damage  --  the best method of attacking a heavily defended target was to converge from all points of the compass at once , " like the enveloping arms of an angry bear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indulging his poetic nature . This gave half the squadron relatively direct courses to their target ; the other half had to curve around , careful to keep well beyond effective radar coverage ; all had to turn exactly on cue . The B-52s had turned ten minutes earlier , on command from the Sentry quarterbacking the mission . The pilot had added a twist . His course to the Soviet formation took his bomber right down a commercial air route . On making his turn , he had switched his IFF transponder from its normal setting to international . He was fifty miles behind a commercial747 , thirty miles ahead of another , and on Soviet radar all three Boeing products would look exactly alike  --  harmless . It was still dark down on the surface . There was no indication that the Russians were alerted yet . Their fighters were only supposed to be VFR ( visual flight rules ) capable , and the pilot imagined that taking off andlanding on a carrier in the dark was pretty risky business , doubly so in bad weather . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercom , " we 're getting L- and S-band emissions . They 're right where they 're supposed to be . " " Roger . Enough for a return off us ? " " That 's affirm , but they probably think we 're flying Pan Am . No fire control stuff yet , just routine air search . " " Range to target ? " " One-three-zero miles . " It was almost time . The mission profile was such that all would hit the 125-mile circle at the same moment . " Everything ready ? " " That 's a roge . " The pilot relaxed for another minute , waiting for the signal from the entry . FLASHLIGHT , FLASHLIGHT , FLASHLIGHT . The signal came over the digital radio channel.  | " That 's it ! Let ' em know we 're here , " the aircraft commander ordered . " Right . " The electronics warfare officer flipped the clear plastic cover off his set of toggle switches and dials controlling the aircraft 's jamming systems . First he powered up his systems . This took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old seventies-vintage equipment , else the squadronwould not be part of the junior varsity . Good learning tools , though , and the lieutenant was hoping to move up to the new B-lBs now beginning to come off the Rockwell assembly line in California . For the past ten minutes the ESM pods on the bomber 's nose and wingtips had been recording the Soviet radar signals , classifying their exact frequencies , pulse repetition rates , power , and the individual signature characteristics of the transmitters . The lieutenant was brand new to this game . He was a recent graduate of electronic warfare school , first in his class . He consideredwhat he should do first , then selected a jamming mode , not his best , from a range of memorized options . The NikolayevOne hundred twenty-five miles away on the Kara-class cruiser Nikolayev , a radar michman was examining some blips that seemed to be in a circle around his formation . In an instant his screen was covered with twenty ghostly splotches tracing crazily in various directions . He shouted the alarm , echoed a second later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried over to check the screen . By the time he got there the jamming mode had changed and six lines like the spokes of a wheel were rotating slowly around a central axis . " Plot the strobes , " the officer ordered . Now there were blotches , lines , and sparkles . " More than one aircraft , Comrade . " The michman tried flipping through his frequency settings . " Attack warning ! " another michman shouted . His ESM receiver had just reported the signals of aircraft search-radar sets of the type used to acquire targets for air-to-surface missiles . The B-52 " We got hard targets , " the weapons officer on the - 52 reported . " I got a lock on the first three birds . " " Roger that , " the pilot acknowledged . " Hold for ten more seconds . " " Ten seconds , " the officer replied . " Cutting switches . . . now . " " Okay , kill the jamming . " " ECM systems off . "  |p192The  Nikolayev " Missile acquisition radars have ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruiser 's captain , just now arrived from the bridge . Around them the Nikolayev 's crew was racing to battle stations . " Jamminghas also ceased . " " What is out there ? " the captain asked . Out of a clear sky his beautiful clipper-bowed cruiser had been threatened  --  and now all was well ? " At least eight enemy aircraft in a circle around us . " The captain examined the now normal S-band air search screen . There were numerous blips , mainly civilian aircraft . The half circle of others had to be hostile , though . " Could they have fired missiles ? " " No , Comrade Captain , we would have detected it . They jammed our search radars for thirty seconds and illuminated us with their own search systems for twenty . Then everything stopped . " " So , they provoke us and now pretend nothing has happened ? " the captain growled . " When will they be within SAM range ? " " This one and these two will be within range in four minutes if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our missile control systems . Teach the bastards a lesson . " The officer gave the necessary instructions , wondering who was being taught what . Two thousand feet above one of the B-52s was an EC-135 whose computerized electronic sensors were recording all signals from the Soviet cruiser and taking them apart , the better to know how to jam them . It was the first good look at the new SA-N-8 missile system . Two F-14 TomcatsThe double-zero code number on its fuselage marked the Tomcat as the squadron commander 's personal bird ; the black ace of spades on the twin-rudder tail indicated his squadron , Fighting 41 , " The Black Aces . " The pilot was Commander Robby Jackson , and his radio call sign was Spade 1 . Jackson was leading a two-plane section under the direction of one of the Kennedy 's E-2C Hawkeyes , the navy 's more diminutive version of the air force 's AWACS and close brother to the COD , a twin-prop aircraft whose radome makes it look like an airplane being terrorized by a UFO . The weather was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but was supposed to improve as they headed west . Jackson and his wingman , Lieutenant ( j.g . ) Bud Sanchez , were flying through nearly solid clouds , and they had eased their formation out somewhat . Inp193the limited visibility both remembered that each Tomcat had a crew of two and a price of over thirty million dollars . They were doing what the Tomcat does best . An all-weather interceptor , the F-14 has transoceanic range , Mach 2 speed , and a radar computer fire control system that can lock onto and attack six separate targets with long-range Phoenix air-to-air missiles . Each fighter was now carrying two of those along with a pair of AIM-9M Sidewinder heat-seekers . ' Their prey was a flight of YAK-36 Forgers , the bastard V/STOL fighters that operated from the carrier Kiev . After harassing the Sentry the previous day , Ivan had decided to close with the Kennedy force , no doubt guided in with data from a reconnaissance satellite . The Soviet aircraft had come up short , their range being fifty miles less than they needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting a little too obnoxious on this side of the ocean . Admiral Painter had been given permission to return the favor , in a friendly sort of way . Jackson figured that he and Sanchez could handle this , even outnumbered . No Soviet aircraft , least of all the Forger , was equal to the Tomcat  --  certainly not while I 'm flying it , Jackson thought . " Spade 1 , your target is at your twelve o'clock and level , distance now twenty miles , " reported the voice of Hummer 1 , the Hawkeye a hundred miles aft . Jackson did not acknowledge . " Got anything , Chris ? " he asked his radar intercept officer , LieutenantCommander Christiansen . " An occasional flash , but nothing I can use . " They were tracking the Forgers with passive systems only , in this case an infrared sensor . Jackson yonsidered illuminating their targets with his powerful fire control radar . The Forgers ' ESM pods would sense this at once , reporting to their pilots that their death warrant had been written but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing . The Kiev group is under total EMCON . " " Cute , " Jackson commented . He guessed that the SAC raid on the Kirov-Nikolayev group had taught them to be more careful . It was not generally known that warships often made no use whatever of their radar systems , a protective measure called EMCON , for emission control . The reason was that a radar beam could be detected at several times the distance at which it generated a return signal to its transmitter and could thus tell an enemy more than it told its operators . " You suppose these guys can find their way home without help ? " " If they do n't , you know who 's gon na get blamed . " Christiansen chuckled . " That 's a roge , " Jackson agreed . " Okay , I got infrared acquisition . Clouds must be thinning out some . "  |p194Christiansen  was concentrating on his instruments , oblivious of the view out of the canopy . " Spade 1 , this is Hummer 1 , your target is twelve o'clock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The report came over the secure radio circuit . Not bad , picking up the Forgers ' heat signature through this slop , Jackson thought , especially since they had small , inefficient engines . " Radar coming on , Skipper , " Christiansen advised . " Kiev has an S-band air search just come on . They have us for sure . " " Right . " Jackson thumbed his mike switch . " Spade 2 , illuminate targets  --  now . " " Roger , lead , " Sanchez acknowledged . No point hiding now . Both fighters activated their powerful AN/AWG-9 radars . It was now two minutes to intercept . The radar signals , received by the ESM threat-receivers on the Forgers ' tail fins , set off a musical tone in the pilot headsets which had to be turned off manually , and lit up a red warning light on each control panel . The Kingfisher Flight " Kingfisher flight , this is Kiev , " called the carrier 's air operations officer . " We show two American fighters closing you at high speed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight leader checked his mirror . He 'd hoped to avoid this , though he had n't expected to . His orders were to take no action unless fired upon . They had just broken into the clear . Too bad , he 'd have felt safer in the clouds . The pilot of Kingfisher 3 , Lieutenant Shavrov , reached down to arm his four Atolls . Not this time , Yankee , he thought . The Tomcats " One minute , Spade 1 , you ought to have visual any time , " Hummer 1 called in . " Roger . . . Tallyho ! " Jackson and Sanchez broke into the clear . The Forgers were a few miles ahead , and the Tomcats ' 250-knot speed advantagewas eating that distance up rapidly . The Russian pilots are keeping a nice , tight formation , Jackson thought , but anybody can drive a bus . " Spade 2 , let 's go to burners on my mark . Three , two , one  --  mark ! " Both pilots advanced their engine controls and engaged their afterburners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new F-110 engines . The fighters lept forward with a sudden double thrust and went quickly through Mach 1.  |p195The  Kingfisher Flight " Kingfisher , warning , warning , the Amerikantsi have increased speed , " Kiev cautioned . Kingfisher 4 turned in his seat . He saw the Tomcats a mile aft , twin dart-like shapes racing before trails of black smoke . Sunlight glinted off one canopy , and it almost looked like the flashes of a  --  " They 're attacking ! " " What ? " The flight leader checked his mirror again . " Negative , negative  --  holdformation ! " The Tomcats screeched fifty feet overhead , the sonic booms they trailed sounding just like explosions . Shavrov acted entirely on his combat-trainedinstincts . He jerked back on his stick and triggered his four missiles at the departing American fighters . " Three , what did you do ? " the Russian flight leader demanded . " They were attacking us , did n't you hear ? " Shavrov protested . The Tomcats " Oh shit ! Spade Flight , you have four Atolls after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Two , break right , " Jackson ordered . " Chris , activate countermeasures . " Jackson threw his fighter into a violent evasive turn to the left . Sanchez broke the other way . In the seat behind Jackson 's , the radar intercept officer flipped switches to activate the aircraft 's defense systems . As the Tomcat twisted in midair , a series of flares and balloons was ejected from the tail section , each an infrared or radar lure for the pursuing missiles . All four were targeted on Jackson 's fighter . " Spade 2 is clear , Spade 2 is clear . Spade 1 , you still have four birds in pursuit , " the voice from the Hawkeye said . " Roger . " Jackson was surprised at how calmly he took it . The Tomcat was doing over eight hundred miles per hour and accelerating . He wondered how much range the Atoll had . His rearward-looking-radar warninglight flicked on . " Two , get after them ! " Jackson ordered . " Roger , lead . " Sanchez swept into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dove at the retreating Soviet fighters . When Jackson turned , two of the missiles lost lock and kept going straight into open air . A third , decoyed into hitting a flare , exploded harmlessly . The fourth kept its infrared seeker head on Spade 1 's glowing tail pipes and bored right in . The missile struck Spade 1 at the base of its starboard rudder fin.  |p196The  impact tossed the fighter completely out of control . Most of the explosive force was spent as the missile blasted through the boron surface into open air . The fin was blown completely off , along with the right-side stabilizer . The left fin was badly holed by fragments , which smashed through the back of the fighter 's canopy , hitting Christiansen 's helmet . The right engine 's fire warning lights came on at once . Jackson heard the oomph over his intercom . He killed every engine switch on the right side and activated the in-frame fire extinguisher . Next he chopped power to his port engine , still on afterburner . By this time the Tomcat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to low-speed configuration . This gave Jackson aileron control , and he worked quickly to get back to normal attitude . His altitude was four thousand feet . There was n't much time . " Okay , baby , " he coaxed . A quick burst of power gave him back aerodynamic control , and the former test pilot snapped his fighter over  --  too hard . It went through two complete rolls before he could catch it in level flight . " Gotcha ! You with me , Chris ? " Nothing . There was no way he could look around , and there were still four hostile fighters behind him . " Spade 2 , this is lead . " " Roger , lead . " Sanchez had the four Forgers bore-sighted . They had just fired at his commander . Hummer 1On Hummer 1 , the controller was thinking fast . The Forgers were holdingformation , and there was a lot of Russian chatter on the radio circuit . " Spade 2 , this is Hummer 1 , break off , I say again , break off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spade 2 , Spade 1 is at your nine o'clock , two thousand feet below you . " The officer swore and looked at one of the enlisted men he worked with . " That was too fast , sir , just too fuckin ' fast . We got tapes of theRusskies . I ca n't understand it , but it sounds like Kiev is right pissed . " " They 're not the only ones , " the controller said , wondering if he haddone the right thing calling Spade 2 off . It sure as hell did n't feel that way . The TomcatsSanchez ' head jerked in surprise . " Roger , breaking off . " His thumb came off the switch . " Goddammit ! " He pulled his stick back , throwing the Tomcat into a savage loop . " Where are you , lead ? " Sanchez brought his fighter under Jackson 's and did a slow circle to survey the visible damage . " Fire 's out , Skipper . Right side rudder and stabilizer are gone . Leftp197side fin  --  shit , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought a hold together . Wait a minute . Chris is slumped over , Skipper . Can you talk to him ? " " Negative , I 've tried . Let 's go back home . " Nothing would have pleased Sanchez more than to blast the Forgers right out of the sky , and with his four missiles he could have done this easily . But like most pilots , he was highly disciplined . " Roger , lead . " " Spade 1 , this is Hummer 1 , advise your condition , over . " " Hummer 1 , we 'll make it unless something else falls off . Tell them to have docs standing by . Chris is hurt . I do n't know how bad . " It took an hour to get to the Kennedy . Jackson 's fighter flew badly , would not hold course in any specific attitude . He had to adjust trim constantly . Sanchez reported some movement in the aft cockpit . Maybe it was just the intercom shot out , Jackson thought hopefully . Sanchez was ordered to land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson . On the final approach the Tomcat started to handle badly . The pilot struggled with his fighter , planting it hard on the deck and catching the number one wire . The right-side landing gear collapsed at once , and the thirty-million-dollar fighter slid sideways into the barrier that had been erected . A hundred men with fire-fighting gear raced toward it from all directions . The canopy went up on emergency hydraulic power . After unbuckling himself Jackson fought his way around and tried to grab for his backseater . They had been friends for many years . Chris was alive . It looked like a quart of blood had poured down the front of hiss flight suit , and when the first corpsman took the helmet off , he saw that it was still pumping out . The second corpsman pushed Jackson out of the way and attached a cervical collar to the wounded airman . Christiansen was lifted gently and lowered onto a stretcher whose bearers ran towards the island . Jackson hesitated a moment before following it . Norfolk Naval Medical CenterCaptain Randall Tait of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Russians . He looked younger than his forty-five years because his full head of black hair showed not the first sign of gray . ' Fait was a Mormon , educated at Brigham Young University and Stanford Medical School , who had joined the navy because he had wanted to see more of the world than one could from an office at the foot of the Wasatch Mountains . He had accomplished that much , and until today had also avoided anything resembling diplomatic duty . As the new chief of the Department of Medicine at Bethesda Naval Medical Center he knew thatp198could n't last . He had flown down to Norfolk only a few hours earlier to handle the case . The Russians had driven down , and taken their time doing it . " Good morning , gentlemen . I 'm Dr. Tait . " They shook hands all around , and the lieutenant who had brought them up walked back to the elevator . " Dr. Ivanov , " the shortest one said . " I am physician to the embassy . " " Captain Smirnov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a career intelligence officer . The doctor had been briefed on the helicopter trip down by a Pentagon intelligence officer who was now drinking coffee in the hospital commissary . " Vasily Petchkin , Doctor . I am second secretary to the embassy . " This one was a senior KGB officer , a " legal " spy with a diplomatic cover . " May we see our man ? " " Certainly . Will you follow me please ? " Tait led them back down the corridor . He 'd been on the go for twenty hours . This was part of the territory as chief of service at Bethesda . He got all the hard calls . One of the first things a doctor learns is how not to sleep . The whole floor was set up for intensive care , Norfolk Naval Medical Center having been built with war casualties in mind . Intensive Care Unit Number Three was a room twenty-five feet square . The only windows were on the corridor wall , and the curtains had been drawn back . There were four beds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost totally concealed . The only thing not hidden by the oxygen mask covering his face was an unruly clump of wheat-colored hair . The rest of his body was fully draped . An IV stand was next to the bed , its two bottles of fluid merging in a single line that led under the covers . A nurse dressed like Tait in surgical greens was standing at the foot of the bed , her green eyes locked on the electrocardiograph readout over the patient 's head , droppingmomentarily to make a notation on his chart . On the far side of the bed was a machine whose function was not immediately obvious . The patient was unconscious . " His condition ? " Ivanov asked . " Critical , " Tait replied . " It 's a miracle he got here alive at all . He was in the water for at least twelve hours , probably more like twenty . Even accounting for the fact that he was wearing a rubber exposure suit , given the ambient air and water temperatures there 's just no way he ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 23.8  --  C. " Tait shook his head . " I 've read about worse hypothermia cases in the literature , but this is by far the worst I 've ever seen . " " Prognosis ? " Ivanov looked into the room . Tait shrugged . " Hard to say . Maybe as good as fifty-fifty , maybe not . He 's still extremely shocky . He 's a fundamentally healthy person . Youp199ca n't see it from here , but he 's in superb physical shape , like a track and field man . He has a particularly strong heart ; that 's probably what kept him alive long enough to get here . We have the hypothermia pretty much under control now . The problem is , with hypothermia so many things go wrong at once . We have to fight a number of separate but connected battles against different systemic enemies to keep them from overwhelminghis natural defenses . If anything 's going to kill him , it 'll be the shock . We 're treating that with electrolytes , the normal routine , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least I  --  " Tait looked up . Another man was pacing down the hall . Younger than Tait , and taller , he had a white lab coat over his greens . He carried a metal chart . " Gentlemen , this is Doctor  --  Lieutenant  --  Jameson . He 's the physicianof record on the case . He admitted your man . What do you have , Jamie ? " " The sputum sample showed pneumonia . Bad news . Worse , his bloodchemistry is n't getting any better , and his white count is dropping . " " Great . " Tait leaned against the window frame and swore to himself . " Here 's the printout from the blood analyzer . " Jameson handed thechart over . " May I see this , please ? " Ivanov came around . " Sure . " Tait flipped the metal cloud chart open and held it so that everyone could see it . Ivanov had never worked with a computerized blood analyzer , and it took several seconds for him to orient himself . " This is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed . " We 're going to have to jump on that pneumonia , hard , " Jameson said . " This kid 's got too many things going wrong . If the pneumonia really takes hold . . . " He shook his head . " Keflin ? " Tait asked . " Yeah . " Jameson pulled a vial from his pocket . " As much as he 'll handle . I 'm guessing that he had a mild case before he got dumped in the water , and I hear that some penicillin-resistant strains have been croppingup in Russia . You use mostly penicillin over there , right ? " Jameson looked down at Ivanov . " Correct . What is this keflin ? " " It 's a big gun , a synthetic antibiotic , and it works well on resistant strains . " " Right now , Jamie , " Tait ordered . Jameson walked around the corner to enter the room . He injected the antibiotic into a 100cc piggyback IV bottle and hung it on a stand . " He 's so young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " His name 's Albert Jameson . We call him Jamie . He 's twenty-nine ,  |p200graduated  Harvard third in his class , and he 's been with us ever since . He 's board-certified in internal medicine and virology . He 's as good as they come . " Tait suddenly realized how uncomfortable he was dealing with the Russians . His education and years of naval service taught him that these men were the enemy . That did n't matter . Years before he had sworn an oath to treat patients without regard to outside considerations . Would they believe this , or did they think he 'd let their man die because he was a Russian ? " Gentlemen , I want you to understand this : we 're giving your man the very best care we can . We 're not holding anything back . If there 's a way to give him back to you alive , we 'll find it . But I ca n't make any promises . " The Soviets could see that . While waiting for instructions from Moscow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , though a religious fanatic , an efficient and honorable physician , one of the best in government service . " Has he said anything ? " Petchkin asked , casually . " Not since I 've been here . Jamie said that right after they started warming him up he was semiconscious and babbled for a few minutes . We taped it , of course , and had a Russian-speaking officer listen to it . Something about a girl with brown eyes , did n't make any sense . Probably his sweetheart  --  he 's a good-looking kid , he probably has a girl at home . It was totally incoherent , though . A patient in his condition has no idea what 's going on . " " Can we listen to the tape ? " Petchkin said . " Certainly . I 'll have it sent up . " Jameson came around the corner . " Done . A gram of keflin every six hours . Hope it works . " " How about his hands and feet ? " Smirnov asked . The captain knew something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " Jameson answered . " We have cotton around the digits to prevent maceration . If he survives the next few days , we 'll get blebs and maybe have some tissue loss , but that 's the least of our problems . You guys know what his name is ? " Petchkin 's head snapped around . " He was n't wearing any dogtags when he arrived . His clothes did n't have the ship 's name . No wallet , no identification , not even any coins in the pockets . It does n't matter very much for his initial treatment , but I 'd feel better if you could pull his medical records . It would be good to know if he has any allergies or underlying medical conditions . We do n't want him to go into shock from an allergic reaction to drug treatment . " " What was he wearing ? " Smirnov asked . " A rubber exposure suit , " Jameson answered . " The guys who foundp201him left it on him , thank God . I cut it off him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , handerchief . Do n't your guys wear dogtags ? " " Yes , " Smirnov responded . " How did you find him ? " " From what I hear , it was pure luck . A helicopter off a frigate was patrolling and spotted him in the water . They did n't have any rescue gear aboard , so they marked the spot with a dye marker and went back to their ship . A bosun volunteered to go in after him . They loaded him and a raft cannister into the chopper and flew him back , with the frigate hustling down south . The bosun kicked out the raft , jumped in after it  --  and landed on it . Bad luck . He broke both his legs , but he did get your sailor into the raft . The tincan picked them up an hour later and they were both flown directly here . " " How is your man ? " " He 'll be all right . The left leg was n't too bad , but the right tibia was badly splintered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months . Wo n't be doing much dancing for a while , though . " The Russians thought the Americans had deliberately removed their man 's identification . Jameson and Tait suspected that the man had disposed of his tags , possibly hoping to defect . There was a red mark on the neck that indicated forcible removal . " If it is permitted , " Smirnov said , " I would like to see your man , to thank him . " " Permission granted , Captain , " Tait nodded . " That would be kind of you . " " He must be a brave man . " " A sailor doing his job . Your people would do the same thing . " Tait wondered if this were true . " We have our differences , gentlemen , but the sea does n't care about that . The sea  --  well , she tries to kill us all regardlesswhat flag we fly . " Petchkin was back looking through the window , trying to make out the patient 's face . " Could we see his clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it wo n't tell you much . He 's a cook . That 's all we know , " Jameson said . " A cook ? " Petchkin turned around . " The officer who listened in on the tape  --  obviously he was an intelligenceofficer , right ? He looked at the number on his shirt and said it made him a cook . " The three-digit number indicated that the patient had been a member of the port watch , and that his battle station was damage control . Jameson wondered why the Russians numbered all their enlisted men . To be sure they did n't trespass ? Petchkin 's head , he noticed , was almost touching the glass pane.  | " Dr. Ivanov , do you wish to attend the case ? " Tait asked . " Is this permitted ? " " It is . " " When will he be released ? " Petchkin inquired . " When may we speak with him ? " " Released ? " Jameson snapped . " Sir , the only way he 'll be out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box . So far as consciousness is concerned , that 's anyone 's guess . That 's one very sick kid you have in there . " " But we must speak to him ! " the KGB agent protested . Tait had to look up at the man . " Mr. Petchkin , I understand your desire to communicate with your man  --  but he is my patient now . We will do nothing , repeat nothing , that might interfere with his treatment and recovery . I got orders to fly down here to handle this . They tell me those orders came from the White House . Fine . Doctors Jameson and Ivanov will assist me , but that patient is now my responsibility , and my job is to see to it that he walks out of this hospital alive and well . Everything else is secondary to that objective . You will be extended every courtesy . But I make the rules here . " Tait paused . Diplomacy was not something he was good at . " Tell you what , you want to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . But you have to follow the rules . That means you scrub , change into sterile clothing , and follow the instructions of the duty nurse . Fair enough ? " Petchkin nodded . American doctors think they are gods , he said to himself . Jameson , busy reexamining the blood analyzer printout , had ignored the sermon . " Can you gentlemen tell us what kind of sub he was on ? " " No , " Petchkin said at once . " What are you thinking , Jamie ? " " The dropping white count and some of these other indicators are consistent with radiation exposure . The gross symptoms would have been masked by the overlying hypothermia . " Suddenly Jameson looked at the Soviets . " Gentlemen , we have to know this , was he on a nuclear sub ? " " Yes , " Smirnov answered , " he was on a nuclear-powered sub-marine . " " Jamie , take his clothing to radiology . Have them check the buttons , zipper , anything metal for evidence of contamination . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects . " May we be involved in this ? " Smirnov asked . " Yes , sir , " Tait responded , wondering what sort of people these were . The guy had to come off a nuclear submarine , did n't he ? Why had n't they told him at once ? Did n't they want him to recover ? Petchkin pondered the significance of this . Did n't they know he had come off a nuclear-powered sub ? Of course  --  he was trying to get Smir/nov to blurt out that the man was off a missile submarine . They were trying to cloud the issue with this story about contamination . Nothing that would harm the patient , but something to confuse their class enemies . Clever . He 'd always thought the Americans were clever . And he was supposed to report to the embassy in an hour  --  report what ? How was he supposed to know who the sailor was ? Norfolk Naval ShipyardThe USS Ethan Allen was about at the end of her string . Commissionedin 1961 , she had served her crews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea-launched ballistic missiles in endless patrols through sunless seas . Now she was old enough to vote , and this was very old for a submarine . Her missile tubes had been filled with ballast and sealed months before . She had only a token maintenance crew while the Pentagon bureaucrats debated her future . There had been talk of a complicated cruise missile system to make her into an SSGN like the new Russian Oscars . This was judged too expensive . Ethan Allen 's was generation-oldtechnology . Her S5W reactor was too dated for much more use . Nuclear radiation had bombarded the metal vessel and its internal fittings with many billions of neutrons . As recent examination of test strips had revealed , over time the character of the metal had changed , becoming dangerously brittle . The system had at most another three years of useful life . A new reactor would be too expensive . The Ethan Allen was doomed by her senescence . The maintenance crew was made up of members of her last operationalteam , mainly old-timers looking forward to retirement , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Ethan Allen could still serve as a school , especially a repair school since so much of her equipment was worn out . Admiral Gallery had come aboard early that morning . The chiefs had regarded that as particularly ominous . He had been her first skipper many years before , and admirals always seemed to visit their early commands  --  right before they were scrapped . He 'd recognized some of the senior chiefs and asked them if the old girl had any life left in her . To a man , the chiefs said yes . A ship becomes more than a machine to her crew . Each of a hundred ships , built by the same men at the same yard to the same plans , will have her own special characteristics  --  most of them had , really , but after her crew becomes accustomed to them they are spoken of affectionately , particularly in retrospect . The admiral had toured the entire length of the Ethan Allen 's hull , pausing to run his gnarled , arthritic hands over the periscope he had used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel hull , to plan the rare " attack " against a ship hunting his sub -- -or a passing tanker , just forp204practice . He 'd commanded the Ethan Allen for three years , alternating his gold crew with another officer 's blue crew , working out of Holy Loch , Scotland . Those were good years , he told himself , a damned sight better than sitting at a desk with a lot of vapid aides running around . It was the old navy game , up or out : just when you got something that you were really good at , something you really liked , it was gone . It made good organizational sense . You had to make room for the youngsters coming up  --  but , God ! to be young again , to command one of the new ones that now he only had the opportunity to ride a few hours at a time , a courtesy to the skinny old bastard in Norfolk . She 'd do it , Gallery knew . She 'd do fine . It was not the end he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to it , a decent end for a fighting ship was something rare . Nelson 's Victory , the Constitution in Boston harbor , the odd battleship kept mummified by her namesake state  --  they 'd had honorable treatment . Most warships were sunk as targets or broken up for razor blades . The Ethan Allen would die for a purpose . A crazy purpose , perhaps crazy enough to work , he said to himself as he returned to COMSUBLANT headquarters . Two hours later a truck arrived at the dock where the Ethan Allen lay dormant . The chief quartermaster on deck at the time noted that the truck came from Oceana Naval Air Station . Curious , he thought . More curiously , the officer who got out was wearing neither dolphins nor wings . He saluted the quarterdeck first , then the chief who had the deck while Ethan Allen 's remaining two officers supervised a repair job on the engine spaces . The officer from the naval air station made arrangements for a work gang to load the sub with four bullet-shaped objects , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely able to fit through the torpedo and capsule loading hatches , and it took some handling to get them emplaced . Next came plastic pallets to set them on and metal straps to secure them . They look like bombs , the chief electricianthought as the younger men did the donkey work . But they could n't be that ; they were too light , obviously made of ordinary sheet metal . An hour later a truck with a pressurized tank on its loadbed arrived . The submarine was cleared of her personnel and carefully ventilated . Then three men snaked a hose to each of the four objects . Finished , they ventilated the hull again , leaving gas detectors near each object . By this time , the crew noted , their dock and the one next to it were being guarded by armed marines so that no one could come over and see what was happening to the Ethan Allen . When the loading , or filling , or whatever , was finished , a chief went below to examine the metal shells more carefully . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A chief yeoman looked thep205designation up in a catalog and did not like what he found  --  Pave Pat Blue 76 . Pave Pat Blue 76 was a bomb , and the Ethan Allen had four of them aboard . Nothing nearly so powerful as the missile warheads she had once carried , but a lot more ominous , the crew agreed . The smoking lamp was out by mutual accord before anyone made an order of it . Gallery came back soon thereafter and spoke with all of the senior men individually . The youngsters were sent ashore with their personal gear and an admonition that they had not seen , felt , heard , or otherwise noticed anything unusual on the Ethan Allen . She was going to be scuttled at sea . That was all . Some political decision in Washington  --  and if you tell that to anyone , start thinking about a twenty-year tour at McMurdo Sound , as one man put it . It was a tribute to Vincent Gallery that each of the old chiefs stayed aboard . Partly it was a chance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say goodbye to a friend . Mostly it was because Gallery said it was important , and the old-timers remembered that his word had been good once . The officers showed up at sundown . The lowest-ranking among them was a lieutenant commander . Two four-striped captains would be workingthe reactor , along with three senior chiefs . Two more four-stripers would handle the navigation , a pair of commanders the electronics . The rest would be spread around to handle the plethora of specialized tasks necessary to the operation of a complex warship . The total complement , not even a quarter the size of a normal crew , might have caused some adverse comment on the part of the senior chiefs , who did n't consider just how much experience these officers had . One officer would be working the diving planes , the chief quartermasterwas scandalized to learn . The chief electrician he discussed this with took it in stride . After all , he noted , the real fun was driving the boats , and officers only got to do that at New London . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look important . True , the quartermaster agreed , but could they handle it ? If not , the electrician decided , they would take care of things  --  what else were chiefs for but to protect officers from their mistakes ? After that they argued good-naturedly over who would be chief of the boat . Both men had nearly identical experience and time in rate . The USS Ethan Allen sailed for the last time at 2345 hours . No tug helped her away from the dock . The skipper eased her deftly away from the dock with gentle engine commands and strains on his lines that his quartermaster could only admire . He 'd served with the skipper before , on the Skipjack and the Will Rogers . " No tugs , no nothin ' , " he reported to his bunkmate later . " The old man knows his shit . " In an hour theyp206were past the Virginia Capes and ready to dive . Ten minutes later they were gone from sight . Below , on a course of one-one-zero , the small crew of officers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boomer shorthanded . The Ethan Allen responded like a champ , steaming at twelve knots , her old machinery hardly making any noise at all.  |p207THE  ELEVENTH DAYMONDAY , 13 DECEMBERAn A-10 ThunderboltIt was a lot more fun than flying DC-9s . Major Andy Richardson had over ten thousand hours in those and only six hundred or so in his A-10 Thunderbolt II strike fighter , but he much preferred the smaller of the twin-engine aircraft . Richardson belonged to the 175th Tactical Fighter Group of the Maryland Air National Guard . Ordinarily his squadron flew out of a small military airfield east of Baltimore . But two days earlier , when his outfit had been activated , the 175th and six other national guard and reserve air groups had crowded the already active SAC base at Loring Air Force Base in Maine . They had taken off at midnight and had refueled in midair only half an hour earlier , a thousand miles out over the North Atlantic . Now Richardson and his flight of four were skimming a hundred feet over the black waters at four hundred knots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were followingat thirty thousand feet in what would look very much to the Soviets like an alpha strike , a weighted attack mission of armed tactical fighters . It was exactly that  --  and also a feint . The real mission belonged to the low-level team of four . Richardson loved the A-10 . She was called with backhanded affection the Warthog or just plain Hog by the men who flew her . Nearly all tactical aircraft had pleasing lines conferred on them by the need in combat for speed and maneuverability . Not the Hog , which was perhaps the ugliest bird ever built for the U.S. Air Force . Her twin turbofan engines hungp208like afterthoughts at the twin-rudder tail , itself a throwback to the thirties . Her slablike wings had not a whit of sweepback and were bent in the middle to accommodate the clumsy landing gear . The undersides of the wings were studded with many hard points so ordnance could be carried , and the fuselage was built around the aircraft 's primary weapon , the GAU-8 thirty-millimeter rotary cannon designed specifically to smash Soviet tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full load of depleteduraniumslugs for their Avenger cannons and a pair of Rockeye cluster bomb cannisters , additional antitank weapons . Directly beneath the fuselage was a LANTIRN ( low-altitude navigation and targeting infrared for night ) pod ; all the other ordnance stations save one were occupied by fuel tanks . The 175th had been the first national guard squadron to receive LANTIRN . It was a small collection of electronic and optical systems that enabled the Hog to see at night while flying at minimum altitude searching for targets . The systems projected a head-up display ( HUD ) on the fighter 's windshield , in effect turning night to day and making this mission profile marginally less hazardous . Beside each LANTIRN pod was a smaller object which , unlike the cannon shells and Rockeyes , was intended for use tonight . Richardson did n't mind  --  indeed , he relished  --  the hazards of the mission . Two of his three comrades were , like him , airline pilots , the third a crop duster , all experienced men with plenty of practice in lowleveltactics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conducted by a naval officer , had taken over an hour . They were paying a visit to the Soviet Navy . Richardson had read in the papers that the Russians were up to something , and when he had heard at the briefing that they were sending their fleet to trail its coat this close to the American coast , he had been shocked at their boldness . It had angered him to learn that one of their crummy little day fighters had back-shot a navy Tomcat the day before , nearly killing one of its officers . He wondered why the navy was being cut out of the response . Most of the Saratoga 's air group was visible on the concrete pads at Loring , sitting alongside the B-52s , A-6E Intruders , and F-18 Hornets with their ordnancecarts a few feet away . He guessed that his mission was only the first act , the delicate part . While Soviet eyes were locked on the alpha strike hovering at the edge of their SAM range , his flight of four would dash in under radar cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To deliver a message . It was surprising that guardsmen had been selected for this mission . Nearly a thousand tactical aircraft were now mobilized on the East Coast , about a third of them reservists of one kind or another , and Richardsonp209guessed that that was part of the message . A very difficult tactical operation was being run by second-line airmen , while the regular squadrons sat ready on the runways of Loring , and McGuire , and Dover , and Pease , and several other bases from Virginia to Maine , fueled , briefed , and ready . Nearly a thousand aircraft ! Richardson smiled . There would n't be enough targets to go around . " Linebacker Lead , this is Sentry-Delta . Target bearing zero-foureight , range fifty miles . Course is one-eight-five , speed twenty . " Richardson did not acknowledge the transmission over the encrypted radio link . The flight was under EMCON . Any electronic noise might alert the Soviets . Even his targeting radar was switched off , and only passive infrared and low-light television sensors were operating . He looked quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to himself . Every man in the flight had at least four thousand hours , more than most regular pilots would ever have , more than most of the astronauts , and their birds were maintained by people who tinkered with airplanes because they liked to . The fact of the matter was that his squadron had better aircraft-availability rates than any regular squadron and had had fewer accidents than the wet-nosed hotdogs who flew the Warthogs in England and Korea . They 'd show the Russkies that . He smiled to himself . This sure beat flying his DC-9 from Washington to Providence and Hartford and back every day for U.S. Air ! Richardson , who had been an air force fighter pilot , had left the service eight years earlier because he craved the higher pay and flashy lifestyle of a commercial airline pilot . He 'd missed Vietnam , and commercial flying did not require anything like this degree of skill ; it lacked the rush of skimming at treetop level . So far as he knew , the Hog had never been used for maritime strike missions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise that she 'd be good at it . Her antitank munitions would be effective against ships . Her cannon slugs and Rockeye clusters were designed to shred armored battle tanks , and he had no doubts what they would do to thin-hulled warships . Too bad this was n't for real . It was about time somebody taught Ivan a lesson . A radar sensor light blinked on his threat receiver ; S-band radar , it was probably meant for surface search , and was not powerful enough for a return yet . The Soviets did not have any aerial radar platforms , and their ship-carried sets were limited by the earth 's curvature . The beam was just over his head ; he was getting the fuzzy edge of it . They would have avoided detection better still by flying at fifty feet instead of a hundred , but orders were not to . " Linebacker flight , this is Sentry-Delta . Scatter and head in , " the AWACS commanded.  |p210The  A-10s separated from their interval of only a few feet to an extended attack formation that left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scatter at thirty miles ' distance . About four minutes . Richardson checked his digital clock ; the Linebacker flight was right on time . Behind them , the Phantoms and Corsairs in the alpha strike would be turning toward the Soviets , just to get their attention . He ought to be seeing them soon .. . The HUD showed small bumps on the projected horizon  --  the outer screen of destroyers , the Udaloys and Sovremennys . The briefing officer had shown them silhouettes and photos of the warships . Beep ! his threat receiver chirped . An X-band missile guidance radar had just swept over his aircraft and lost it , and was now trying to regain contact . Richardson flipped on his ECM ( electronic countermeasures ) jamming systems . The destroyers were only five miles away now . Forty seconds . Stay dumb , comrades , he thought . He began to maneuver his aircraft radically , jinking up , down , left , right , in no particular pattern . It was only a game , but there was no sense in giving Ivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his Hogs would be blazing in behind a swarm of antiradar missiles and would be accompanied by Wild Weasel aircraft trying to scramble and kill Soviet missile control systems . Things were moving very fast now . A screening destroyerloomed in his path , and he nudged his rudder to pass clear of her by a quarter mile . Two miles to the Kirov  --  eighteen seconds . The HUD system painted an intensified image . The Kirov 's pyramidal mast-stack-radar structure was filling his windshield . He could see blinkingsignal lights all around the battle cruiser . Richardson gave more right rudder . They were supposed to pass within three hundred yards of the ship , no more , no less . His Hog would blaze past the bow , the others past the stern and either beam . He did n't want to cut it too close . The major checked to be certain that his bomb and cannon controls were locked in the safe position . No sense getting carried away . About now in a real attack he 'd trigger his cannon and a stream of solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward missile magazines , exploding the SAM and cruise missiles in a huge fireball and slicing through the superstructureas if it were thin as newsprint . At five hundred yards , the captain reached down to arm the flare pod , attached next to the LANTIRN . Now ! He flipped the switch , which deployed half a dozen highintensitymagnesium parachute flares . All four Linebacker aircraft acted within seconds . Suddenly the Kirov was inside a box of blue-white magnesium light . Richardson pulled back on his stick , banking into a climbing turn past the battle cruiser . The brilliant light dazzled him , butp211he could see the graceful lines of the Soviet warship as she was turning hard on the choppy seas , her men running along the deck like ants . If we were serious , you 'd all be dead now  --  get the message ? Richardson thumbed his radio switch . " Linebacker Lead to SentryDelta , " he said in the clear . " Robin Hood , repeat , Robin Hood . Linebackerflight , this is lead , form up on me . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Sentry-Delta . Outstanding ! " the controller responded . " Be advised that Kiev has a pair of Forgers in the air , thirty miles east , heading your way . They 'll have to hustle to catch up . Will advise . Out . " Richardson did some fast arithmetic in his head . They probably could not catch up , and even if they did , twelve Phantoms from the 107th Fighter Interceptor Group were ready for it . " Hot damn , lead ! " Linebacker 4 , the crop duster , moved gingerly into his slot . " Did you see those turkeys pointing up at us ? God damn , did we rattle their cage ! " " Heads up for Forgers , " Richardson cautioned , grinning ear to ear inside his oxygen mask . Second-line flyers , hell ! " Let ' em come , " Linebacker 4 replied . " Any of those bastards closes me and my thirty , it 'll be the last mistake he ever makes ! " Four was a little too aggressive for Richardson 's liking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Linebacker flight , this is Sentry-Delta . The Forgers have turned back . You 're in the clear . Out . " " Roger that , out . Okay , flight , let 's settle down and head home . I guess we 've earned our pay for the month . " Richardson looked to make sure he was on an open frequency . " Ladies and gentlemen , this is Captain Barry Friendly , " he said , using the in-house U.S. Air public relations joke that had become a tradition in the 175th . " I hope you have enjoyed your flight , and thank you for flying Warthog Air . " The KirovOn the Kirov , Admiral Stralbo raced from the combat information center to the flag bridge , too late . They had acquired the low-level raiders only a minute from the outer screen . The box of flares was already behind the battle cruiser , several still burning in the water . The bridge crew , he saw , was rattled . " Sixty to seventy seconds before they were on us , Comrade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were tracking the orbiting attack force and these four  --  we think , four  --  raced in under our radar coverage . We had missile lock on two of them despite their jamming . " Stralbo frowned . That performance was not nearly good enough . Ifp212the strike had been real , the Kirov would have been badly damaged at least . The Americans would gladly trade a pair of fighters for a nuclearpoweredcruiser . If all American aircraft attacked like this .. . " The arrogance of the Americans is fantastic ! " The fleet zampolit swore . " It was foolish to provoke them , " Stralbo observed sourly . " I knew that something like this would happen , but I expected it from Kennedy . " " That was a mistake , a pilot error , " the political officer replied . " Indeed , Vasily . And this was no mistake ! They just sent us a message , telling us that we are fifteen hundred kilometers from their shore without useful air cover , and that they have over five hundred fighters waiting to pounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stalking us to the east like a rabid wolf . We are not in an attractive position . " " The Americans would not be so brash . " " Are you sure of that , Comrade Political Officer ? Sure ? What if one of their aircraft commits a pilot error ' ? And sinks one of our destroyers ? And what if the American president gets on the direct link to Moscow to apologize before we can even report it ? They swear it was an accident and promise to punish the stupid pilot  --  then what ? You think the imperialists are so predictable this close to their own coastline ? I do not . I think they are praying for the smallest excuse to pounce on us . Come to my cabin . We must consider this . " The two men went aft . Stralbo 's cabin was a spartan affair . The only decoration on the wall was a print of Lenin speaking to Red Guards . " What is our mission , Vasily ? " Stralbo asked . " To support our submarines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exactly . Our mission is to support , not to conduct offensive operations . The Americans do not want us here . Objectively , I can understand this . With all our missiles we are a threat to them . " " But our orders are not to threaten them , " the zampolit protested . " Why would we want to strike their homeland ? " " And , of course , the imperialists recognize that we are peaceful socialists ! Come now , Vasily , these given the smallest excuse . They are already interfering with our search , pretending to help . They do not want us here  --  and in allowing ourselves to be provoked by their aggressiveactions , we fall into their trap . " The admiral stared down at his desk . " Well , we shall change that . I will order the fleet to discontinue anything that may appear the least bit aggressive . We will end all air operations beyond normal local patrolling . We will not harass their nearby fleet units . We will use only normal navigational radars . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our pride and be as meek as mice . Whatever provocation they make , we will not react to it . " " Some will call this cowardice , Comrade Admiral , " the zampolit warned . Stralbo had expected that . " Vasily , do n't you see ? In pretending to attack us they have already victimized us . They force us to activate our newest and most secret defense systems so they can gather intelligence on our radars and fire control systems . They examine the performance of our fighters and helicopters , the maneuverability of our ships , and most of all , our command and control . We shall put an end to that . Our primary mission is too important . If they continue to provoke us , we will act as though our mission is indeed peaceful  --  which it is as far as they are concerned  --  and protest our innocence . And we make them the aggressors . If they continue to provoke us , we shall watch to see what their tactics are , and give them nothing in return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out our mission ? " The zampolit mumbled his consent . If they failed in their mission , the charge of cowardice would be a small matter indeed . If they found the renegade submarine , they 'd be heroes regardless of what else happened . The DallasHow long had he been on duty ? Jones wondered . He could have checked easily enough by punching the button on his digital watch , but the sonarman did n't want to . It would be too depressing . Me and my big mouth  --  you bet , Skipper , my ass ! he swore to himself . He 'd detected the sub at a range of about twenty miles , maybe , had just barely gotten her  --  and the fuckin ' Atlantic Ocean was three thousand miles across , at least sixty footprint diameters . He 'd need more than luck now . Well , he did get a Hollywood shower out of it . Ordinarily a shower on a freshwater-poor ship meant a few seconds of wetting down and a minute or so of lathering , followed by a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you clean but was not very satisfying . This was an improvement over the old days , the oldtimers liked to say . But back then , Jones often responded , the sailors had to pull oars  --  or run off diesel and batteries , which amounted to the same thing . A Hollywood shower is something a sailor starts thinking about after a few days at sea . You leave the water running , a long , continuous stream of wonderfully warm water . CommanderMancuso was given to awarding this sensuous pastime in return for above-average performance . It gave people something tangible to work for . You could n't spend extra money on a sub , and there was no beer or women . Old movies  --  they were making an effort on that score . The boat 's library was n't had , when you had time to sort through the jumble . Andp214the Dallas had a pair of Apple computers and a few dozen game programs for amusement . Jones was the boat champion at Choplifter and Zork . The computers were also used for training purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texts that ate up most of the use time . The Dallas was quartering an area east of the Grand Banks . Any boat transiting Route One tended to come through here . They were moving at five knots , trailing out the BQR-15 towed-array sonar . They 'd had all kinds of contacts . First , half the submarines in the Russian Navy had whipped by at high speed , many trailed by American boats . An Alfa had burned past them at over forty knots , not three thousand yards away . It would have been so easy , Jones had thought at the time . The Alfa had been making so much noise that one could have heard it with a glass against the hull , and he 'd had to turn his amplifiers down to minimums to keep the noise from ruining his ears . A pity they could n't have fired . The setup had been so simple , the firing solution so easy that a kid with an old-fashioned sliderule could have done it . That Alfa had been meat on the table . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of all . Jones had been listening to surface ships a ways to the west , a lot of them doing twenty knots or so , making all kinds of noise as they pounded through the waves . They were way far off , and not his concern . They had been trying to acquire this particular target for over two days , and Jones had had only an odd hour of sleep here and there . Well , that 's what they pay me for , he reflected bleakly . This was not unprecedented , he 'd done it before , but he 'd be happy when the labor ended . The large-aperture towed array was at the end of a thousand-foot cable . Jones referred to the use of it as trolling for whales . In addition to being their most sensitive sonar rig , it protected the Dallas against intruders shadowing her . Ordinarily a submarine 's sonar will work in any direction except aft  --  an area called the cone of silence , or the baffles . The BQR-15 changed that . Jones had heard all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time , low-flying aircraft on occasion . Once , during an exercise off Florida , it had been the noise of diving pelicans that he could not figure out until the skipper had raised the periscope for a look . Then off Bermuda they had encountered mating humpbacks , and a very impressive noise that was . Jones had a personal copy of the tape of them for use on the beach : some women had found it interesting , in a kinky sort of way . He smiled to himself . There was a considerable amount of surface noise . The signal processorsfiltered most of it out , and every few minutes Jones switched them off his channel , getting the sound unimpeded to make sure that they were n't filtering too much out . Machines were dumb ; Jones wondered if SAPSp215might be letting some of that anomalous signal get lost inside the computerchips . That was a problem with computers , really a problem with programming : you 'd tell the machine to do something , and it would go do it to the wrong thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew a few people from college who drew up game programs for personal computers ; one of them was making good money with Sierra On-Line Systems .. . Daydreaming again , Jonesy , he chided himself . It was n't easy listening to nothing for hours on end . It would have been a good idea , he thought , to let sonarmen read on duty . He had better sense than to suggest it . Mr. Thompson might go along , but the skipper and all the senior officers were ex-reactor types with the usual rule of iron : You shall watch every instrument with absolute concentration all the time . Jones did n't think this was very smart . It was different with sonarmen . They burned out too easily . To combat this Jones had his music tapes and his games . He could lose himself in any sort of diversion , especially Choplifter . A man had to have something , he reasoned , to lose his mind in , at least once a day . And something on duty in some cases . Even truck drivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tape players to keep from becomingmesmerized . But sailors on a nuclear sub costing the best part of a billion .. . Jones leaned forward , pressing the headphones tight against his head . He tore a page of doodles from his scratch pad and noted the time on a fresh sheet . Next he made some adjustments on his gain controls , already near the top of the scale , and flipped off the processors again . The cacophony of surface noise nearly took his head off . Jones tolerated this for a minute , ' working the manual muting controls to filter out the worst of the high-frequency noise . Aha ! Jones said to himself . Maybe SAPS is messing me up a little  --  too soon to tell for sure . When Jones had first been checked out on this gear in sonar school he 'd had a burning desire to show it to his brother , who had a masters in electrical engineering and worked as a consultant in the recording industry . He had eleven patents to his name . The stuff on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy 's systems for digitalizing sound were years ahead of any commercial technique . Too bad it was all classified right alongside nuclear stuff .. . " Mr. Thompson , " Jones said quietly , not looking around , " can you ask the skipper if maybe we can swing more easterly and drop down a knot or two ? " " Skipper , " Thompson went out into the passageway to relay the request . New course and engine orders were given in fifteen seconds . Mancuso was in sonar ten seconds after that . The skipper had been sweating this . It had been obvious two days
