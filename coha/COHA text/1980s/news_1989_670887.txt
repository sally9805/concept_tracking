Having best friends offers children a chance to test new levels of intimacy that mirror the social challenges they face . For a toddler , that may mean learning to share a prized doll ; for a teen-ager , it may be confiding an inner fear or growing crush too discomforting to discuss with parents. // Child-development researchers have discovered that the adolescent and adult style of best friendship , in which a person has a single best friend , is uncommon among young children . They have also found that the way boys interact with best friends is quite different from the way girls do. // " Two-thirds of the kids I interviewed between kindergarten and sixth grade told me that they had two or three equally good friends instead of one best friend , " said Dr. Thomas J. Berndt , a professor of psychological sciences at Purdue University in West Lafayette , Ind. , who studies children ' s friendships . But he and other researchers have also found that having a single best friend is more common for girls than for boys , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 2 years old , boys have more friends than girls , " said Dr. Carolee Howes , a developmental psychologist and an associate professor of education at the University of California at Los Angeles , who studies friendships among toddlers and preschoolers . And as the children grow older , there are significant qualitative differences between the best friendships of boys and those of girls. // " Girls ' friendships tend to be more intimate than boys ' , " Dr. Berndt said . " They ' re more concerned about sharing thoughts and feelings . That ' s one of the reasons why girls spend more time in pairs and boys spend more time in larger groups. " // Children ' s recognition that they feel closer to some friends than to others begins while they are toddlers . " I see these preferred playmate relationships starting at 12 to 14 months of age in day-care centers , " Dr. Howes said . Some of these relationships are remarkably stable. // " We found that 10 percent of toddlers kept their closest friends for three years , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have more social skills as preschoolers. " // The friendship pattern changes in early elementary school . No longer are best friends simply the children played with most . By the time children are about 10 years old , they have developed a greater sense of empathy and are therefore more likely to select a best friend based on the type of person that friend is. // " There ' s more of an emotional investment in the relationship by then , " said Dr. James Youniss , the director of the Youth Research Center at Catholic University in Washington . His research involved interviews with more than 1 , 000 children and adolescents. // " By the time they ' re 11 or 12 , they start thinking of a best friend as someone they can count on and trust , " Dr. Youniss continued. // As children approach adolescence , the focus of a best friendship shifts from simply playing together to talking to each other . This change reflects more than their growing verbal and intellectual skills . School is now more complex , both academically and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who they really are , who they would like to be and how they compare with others. // " Talking to a best friend is a way of testing whether your understandings of situations are on track , " said Dr. Stuart T. Hauser , a psychiatrist and the director of the young-adult development project at Harvard Medical School . " It can also help a child get a new perspective on his family . " <> <> A Little Conflict Doesn ' t Hurt // PARENTS should keep several things in mind when it comes to their children ' s best friends : // * Do not worry if your child does not have a best friend . Developmental psychologists and child psychiatrists emphasize that not having a very close relationship is seldom a problem as long as the child gets along well with classmates and playmates. // " I ' d be more concerned if it ' s a lopsided relationship , where the child is constantly giving and not receiving , " advised Dr. Stuart T. Hauser , the director of the young-adult development project at Harvard Medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have problems with self-esteem . " The child may be desperate for the relationship , " he said. // * Limited amounts of conflict between best friends are often a good sign . " Adults tell children , especially girls , ' Don ' t fight , kids , ' " said Dr. Catherine R. Cooper , the director of the developmental psychology program at the University of California at Santa Cruz . " But a good friendship is one in which you can fight and still maintain the relationship. " // * Remember that , painful as it is , suffering the rejection of a close friend and learning how to recover from that rejection are an important part of growing up . " Parents sometimes get too involved when they see their children being hurt in a friendship , " said Dr. James Youniss , the director of the Youth Research Center at Catholic University in Washington . " Usually , children handle these situations best by themselves. " // * Don ' t interpret the shift in where your children look for emotional support as a rejection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your children ' s need for independence and emotional intimacy with someone outside the family , " Dr. Hauser advised . " It allows those children to develop a more mature relationship with their own parents. " // * Remember that children learn a lot about friendships by watching how their parents enter into and maintain them . " Talk to your children about the friendships you had when you were their age , " Dr. Cooper said . " Be sure to tell them about the difficulties you had , too. " //
