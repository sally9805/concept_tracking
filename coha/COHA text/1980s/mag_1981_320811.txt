" I play tennis , but I do n't win tournaments , so I did n't know what to do with it , " said Pianist Andr-Michel Schub , 28 , hoisting his silver trophy high over his head Bjorn Borg-style after winning the sixth Van Cliburn International Quadrennial Piano Competition . <P> His performances during the two-week contest in Fort Worth were strictly center court . Impressed by his emotionally spare , but powerful and nearly flawless technique , the eleven-member international jury gave the Paris-born , Brooklyn-raised musician the nod over 38 other entrants . A victory on the high Cs is nothing new to Schub-in 1974 he won the Naumburg competition and three years later the Avery Fisher Prize-but the Van Cliburn win carries a $ 12,000 cash award , a recording contract and two years of solo and concerto appearances . <P> Says the pianist of his now full performance schedule : " My page is black . " <P> Yikes ! Is CBS Chairman William S. Paley , 79 , one of the <P> more accomplished corporate executioners of modern times , learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veteran shoman-warrior , who has disposed of two CBS presidents in the past five years , was just cutting up with Actor Toshiro Mifune ( Tom ! Tom ! Tom ! ) , 61 , during a recent visit to Japan . On location in Kyoto with the cast of The Equals , a CBS movie due out next year , Paley cast an experienced samureye on the set before joining Mifune in light swordplay . Affecting a traditional shogun stance , the CBS chairman cried : " Critics beware ! " <P> <P> " I am devoting more time to the birdbrains in my comic strip Shoe . I would like to devote less time to the birdbrains on the national and international stages . " So said Jeff MacNelly , 33 , last week as he announced that he was giving up regular political cartooning . From his editorial-page perch at the Richmond ( Va . ) News Leader , MacNelly had drawn and quartered Washington wildlife through eleven years and four Administrations . His winsome wit and goofily graceful draftsmanship had won him two Pulitzer prizes and syndication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tailed the dogged daily routine too long . Says he : " I would like to work end to end on something . " Though he plans to spend more time on Shoe and the featherbrained journalists who work for the Treetops Tattler Tribune , MacNelly is hardly going out on a limb : started less than four years ago , the strip is already syndicated in 650 newspapers . <P> <P> With Rome 's ocher-tinted buildings fairly glowing in the late-afternoon sun , Pope John Paul II , 61 , made his way gingerly down the steps of Gemelli Hospital , almost three weeks to the hour after being felled by a terrorist 's bullets . He appeared gaunt and a trifle pale , but the sparkle was back in his eye . <P> Smiling as he walked toward his black , open-top limousine , the Pontiff stopped for an instant when greeted by a young girl bearing a welcome-back bouquet . Due for a second operation by month 's end , the Pontiff was nevertheless in high spirits . " You think you can now boast that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his doctors , " but I 'm the same rascal I have always been . " - By E. Graydon Carter
