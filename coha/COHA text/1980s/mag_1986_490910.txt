TT the curve of the highway , there appears , some five miles below us in the valley , the famous city of Dresden . More thoroughly than any other city , Dresden was de  --  stroyed during the last world war . Now it glimmers and breathes in the sunlight . There is a whitish flatness about it : no architectural landmarks , and none of the giant smokestacks that herald the other cities of East Ger  --  many from afar . And from that dis  --  tance we can see none of the famous ruins . As our car moves into the city , we begin to comprehend why this is so . Most of Dresden has been razed . We stop at a parking lot on one side of the Pragerstrasse , an enormous pedes  --  trian mall . We can not drive farther . Our hotel looms , fifteen stories high , on the other side of the mall , which is a half mile long  --  a flat , paved expanse between large concrete buildings of different heights : hotels , department stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet look rather than a Midwestern American one , but with an Aztec ( or perhaps Mongol ) element here and there : concrete piles of build  --  ings without eyebrows but with out  --  cropping cheekbones . The Russians have been here for forty years , of course . Our hotel is the Hotel Newa , and its address is the Lenin  --  graderstrasse . So this is the new Dresden , a modern city got together on top of the rubble and situated with  --  in the imperial sphere of the Soviet Union  --  this once prince  --  ly rococo Saxon city , which , with its music conservatories and cream cakes , was much favored by Americans before the First World War ( and also by Russians of the czarist era ) . It is still very German . As so often happened during the Sec  --  ond World War , the bombers missed one essential target . The old railroad station is still there , beyond the mall . It was built in the eighteen-nineties , a massive , solid building with a roof of glass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War German battle  --  ship . Something of an older Germany is more visible and palpable here in East Germany than in the prosperous West . The government of the Ger ? man Democratic Republic knows this . It has gone beyond earlier pathetic and servile efforts to establish its presence , and has reached a stage of self-con  --  sciousness wherein it proclaims the G.D.R . to be the legitimate successor of the old , the historic , Germany . Its banners , draped on the fronts of buildings , announce , " DIE D.D.R . IST UNSER VATERLANDI " In West Germany , the railroad and the postal service are identified as those of a fed  --  eral republic : Deutsche . Bundeshahn , Bundespost . Here the names are harsh and assertive : Deutsche Reichsbahn , Deutsche Post  --  the railroad , the post office of the German Reich . Mean  --  while , some of the streets carry the names of international Communists of the nineteen-thirties ; the hotel chain is Interhotel , and the airline is Interflug . This much remains of the erstwhile Communist International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Along the mall , at two in the after  --  noon , we can buy lunch only in the bowels of an office building ; beyond the plate-glass door , one finds oneself immediately in the midst of the sad grimness of a German communal res  --  taurant during the war . We are in need of a road map of the G.D.R . There are none to be found , even in the large bookstores , which are crowded with people . The young women at the hotel desk allow us to borrow , for an hour or two , one that was printed in England many years ago . They can not procure tickets to the state opera for us . It is now five o'clock . We have come hack to the ho  --  tel , tired after a long walk , hav  --  ing crossed the concrete desert of the mall twice . We went to look at the Altstadt  --  the old city  --  at the north end of the mall . It was not difficult to find , An hour later , we go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sovietish mall , beyond the new Dres  --  den , the first ruins appear : a great semicircle of them , perhaps a square mile in extent , stretching from the mall to the flat banks of the Elbe . They are the largest reminder of the Second World War in Europe  --  per  --  haps in the world . In Hiroshima and in Berlin , a few buildings were left in ruins as a reminder ; the rebuilt city flows around them . But this is differ  --  ent . In Dresden , the old city is a mon  --  ument of ruins . In the West  --  in Lon  --  don or Nuremberg , say  --  the ruins were cleared away ; ten years after the war little or nothing of them remained . In the East , in Budapest and Warsaw ( the latter destroyed by the Germans in two installments ) , the old districts have been rebuilt almost completely an outlet for patriotism and traditional pride , and an activity for which their unpopular governments got some credit . Here it almost seems as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cleared or reconstructed  --  as if the destroyed Altstadt were meant to be a piece of propaganda to show peo  --  ple what the war was like and what the Western enemies of Germany wrought . Restoration has been going on only desultorily , here and there . For someone who lived through the war in Europe , these ruined acres are an instant reminder of forty years ago . Some things about the ruins , however , are different . Forty years have aged the walls . They are no longer stone-colored or burned black . Four decades of grime and smoke and rain have made them dark brown , so that they look even more startling than the ruins among which one trudged in 1945 . They are sombre and macabre enough , but there is an element of beauty in their midst . Trees have grown up within these walls , among these tooth  --  less giant buildings . Trees , not weeds ? we are in the northern half of Eu  --  rope , where vegetation is not riotous . There is something melancholy and peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courtyards of death . In the park of the palace of the Saxon kings , German and Russian soldiers amble about . One of the palace buildings is half restored . Band music is playing over loud  --  speakers . We walk down to the Elbe . Old-fashioned paddle steamers ( bear  --  ing such names as Friedrich Engels and Karl Liebknecht ) are tied up along the quay . With their paddle boxes , they are white and broad-hipped , like Saxon women of the past . Here , at least , Dresden looks as it must have looked in the past , the river surely reminiscent of the scene Bellot  --  to painted two hundred years ago . ( Warsaw , Dresden  --  the famous river  --  scapes . He must have appreciated that green-and-blue flatness , like the Vene  --  tian lagoons . ) Yes , the afternoon sky over the Elbe at Dresden is pale-blue , fine , unbroken porcelain  --  a Bellotto sky . In the Theaterplatz , the equestrian statue of Johann I , King of Saxony during the Reichs grundung , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned ruins and the opera house , which has been rebuilt . This is the Semper Opera , named after its ar  --  chitect , Gottfried Semper . It is an oval neo-Renaissance building , with a curi  --  ous history . The first Semper Opera , THE NEW YORKER 97 built in 1841 , burned down in 1869 and was rebuilt less than a decade later ; in 1945 , the bombs all but de  --  stroyed it , and it has been completely reconstructed  --  an achievement begun in 1977 , finished in 1983 , and com  --  memorated by a tablet at the main entrance . Fielelis Scraper ! Around a side entrance , its doors painted a shiny dark brown , men and women are gathering . It is half past six . The performance tonight is a " Klassischer Ballett-Abend " ? an evening of classi  --  cal ballet  --  beginning at eight . Peo  --  ple are standing in line for the remain  --  ing tickets . I do not like standing in line for anything  --  surely not at the end of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  absolutely , completely nothing else  --  to do in Dresden at night . There are three public entrances to the Semper Opera . The main entrance is for those who possess tickets or special passes . Another is for those who have reserved tickets . The en  --  trance in front of which we are waiting is for people who hope for standing room , or for seats if any are left . The gathering now becomes a small crowd . People come in groups , and some congregate in front of the main door , too . Precisely at seven o'clock -- I look at my watch , because there is no sound of bells from the dead , burned towers of the churches around us  --  something happens : the Semper Opera bursts into light . Hun  --  dreds of electric candles glow and glitter from their chandeliers through the great , palatial Renaissance win  --  dows . It is still light outside ; all this grand illumination is interior . The Semper Opera is a brilliant jewel box ablaze . At once , the main door is opened ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are coming out of the evening , across the broad , cobblestoned square surrounded by the silent , un  --  moving , darkening ruins . The scene is semicircular , and probably unre  --  cordable even by the widest-lensed of cameras . It is unforgettable , a scene beyond the means of the most imperi  --  ous of theatre directors , a true piece of Welttheater : this nineteenth-century jewel box drawing the stunned , the desperate , the determined , the fortu  --  nate , the hopeful to its lights , and three hundred feet away the gigantic backdrop of the ruins . They are black now , and the green , living trees inside them have turned black , too  --  indis  --  tinguishable from those ominous tow  --  ers in the moonless falling night . A backdrop is always a reminder of sorts . ( For once , a German word is more telling than the English one : " Mahn  --  ung " combines the meanings of re  --  minder and warning , its tone intensely sombre . ) Between the ruins and the theatre , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johann I and the groups of people arriving . Most of the people come on foot . On one side of the square is a paved roadway , where cars may pull up to drop off their passen  --  gers . Every few minutes , a Volvo or a black Russian-made limousine appears , carrying what are rather obviously members of the governing class of the German Democratic Republic  --  con  --  tent , smiling men and women of the bureaucracy , who make their way with ease through the crowd and enter the golden light of the Semper 's foyer to be led to their boxes and seats . From one of the limousines emerges a group of North Koreans in European clothes . They wear red badges bearing the enamelled portrait of their dictator , Kim Il Sung ; they are smiling rigid  --  ly , their features , I am sorry to say , proletarian and cruel . Later , two or three tour buses pull up . One of them is from West Germany . Its license plate indicates that , but so do its pas  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better dressed than their East German compatriots . But perhaps " compatriot " is not the right word ; they inhabit a different world from the people of Dresden  --  different economically , politically , and ideo  --  logically , as well as in dress . They belong to another age of history , these prosperous envoys from the West on a prepaid package visit to their impover  --  ished relatives . The opera-loving people of Dresden seem the older Germans , and not only because in the Eastern part of Europe life is harder and people age faster . The shapes , the clothes , the faces of so many of these men milling before the opera , waiting for their wives , are reminiscent of the Germans of Ger  --  many before the war , sometimes to the point of caricature . They are heavy , thick-necked , odd-lipped , with hard creases around their mouths , and heavy jowls . They have George Grosz countenances , though without the uniforms and high collars , and with  --  out the arrogance that that vengeful German artist attributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ger  --  man photographer , apparently full of hatred for his own people , brought out an album of monstrous portraits of the stiff and distorted faces and figures of ordinary German citizens ; 1 saw it a few years ago , in an edition that was published in New York . Some of these men remind me suddenly of the faces in that album . But , I repeat , they are devoid of arrogance . Their wives have brought them along to the music and the splendor . I must bow my head before these wives of Dresden . Here they are , heavier than their coevals in the West , serious and patient . It is they who have a sense of occasion . Many of them wear long skirts , which , for fashionable evenings , are going out of style in West Germany ; but these women do n't know that , and it 's not important . They come to pay homage to a culture they hope is still theirs , to the high-bourgeois nine  --  teenth-century virtues represented by an evening at the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , beyond that , for the occasion : to spend three hours once more in their opera house , which  --  unlike the Zwinger , that eighteenth-century rococo palace , which lies a hundred yards away  --  has been redone with all the opulence of a century that for them is irrevocably past and yet not unfamiliar . We are told that most people arrive at seven , an hour before the perfor  --  mance , because the buffets of the opera house open early , offering sandwiches and Russian champagne that is very cheap . It is now ten minutes before eight , and still not everyone is inside . The shiny brown doors are opened from time to time by an official , who admits eight or ten people at once . At one minute before eight , we are let in . We are among the last , and get tickets to the highest gallery , for a few cents ? standing room only . So we enter the Semper Opera . It is the eighteen-sev  --  enties to the last jot and tittle . Crimson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columns with creamy capitals , enormous mir  --  rors  --  all in the eclectic neo-Renais  --  sance style of the nineteenth century but somehow all of a piece . Only the colors of the many frescoes on the ceil  --  ing are a bit too new , too sharp . ( Gott  --  fried Semper , that neoclassicist , was a great advocate of polychrome . ) The opera house is stuffed to the gills , but there is little of the loud , titillating hum that reverberates in theatres be  --  fore the curtain rises . The air is not still , however ; it is full of the subdued sounds of a silent respect . The performance is very good : ex  --  cerpts from " Swan Lake , " " Sleeping Beauty , " " La Bayadere . " In contrast to the florid richness of the interior , the spectacle is reduced to simplicity . The ballets are performed on an empty stage , on a black slate floor . The danc  --  ers of the Dresden State Opera Ballet are like white butterflies , flying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of stage decor is the fact that the orchestra is not visible  --  but perhaps an array of se  --  rious German musicians in frock coats and white ties  --  yet another image from the past  --  would have been too much . The respectfulness carries over to the end , with no thunderous applause , no pompous bourgeois shouting of " Bravo ! " There is something like a hushed thankfulness instead . During the long wait outside , I had seen an old , quiet German woman in the crowd at the door . Her gray hair was pulled back in a bun , and she wore a long gray evening dress . She waited patiently , holding her program and leaning with one elbow on a crutch . Sometimes she rested her thin frame against the rusticated stone wall . She must have had some difficulty hobbling up to the fourth tier of the opera house . There she stood , not far from us , wearing a little smile and leaning forward on her crutch . There was no need to speculate about her : this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intermission , fortu  --  nately , she found a seat . I had the urge to say something to her in my halting German . I did not do so ; and perhaps she would have been embarrassed if I had . It was then that the meaning of the evening crystallized in my mind . This must have been how the people of the Middle Ages entered the vast , magical spaces of their cathedrals for high Mass , the only splendor in their lives . There was , however , a differ  --  ence . That experience in the Middle Ages came to people with no con  --  sciousness of history . For the people of Dresden today , the Semper Opera was the tangible presence of a better past  --  a past that some of them still remem  --  bered . They thought that they were being faithful to what was best in themselves . Did they shut out from their minds the dreariness of their present , of their everyday lives ? Per  --  haps not . When the evening was over and they left that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , still stunned forty years after their defeat , found the black monumental ruins staring at them . Whether they stared back or not , I could not see . ? JOHN LUKACS
