A flyer has bailed out over open sea . A rescue helicopter circles the area , looking for a sign of pilot or plane . Anxious minutes pass until-eureka ! An unlikely crew member sights a life jacket below and alerts his fellow searchers . The pilot is saved , thanks to the quick , keen eyes of an official U.S. military pigeon . <P> The incident is imaginary , but the bird is not . It belongs to a five-pigeon rescue detachment the U.S. Coast Guard has been testing for three years . Each member of the squad is harnessed into a separate compartment in a transparent observation chamber mounted on the side of a helicopter . All have been taught to peck at an electrical switch when they see anything orange , red or yellow , the conventional colors of emergency equipment . In test flights the pigeons spotted a floating target on the first pass 90% of the time ; the score for humans was 38% . When both birds and people saw the target , the pigeons were the first spotters six times out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pigeon system this fall for real search-and-rescue missions . If a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush , the pigeons ' commanders hope three in the chopper will be worth the $160,000 spent so far on the scheme .
