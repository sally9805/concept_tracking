Reregulation is the cry as fares continue to slide <P> At no time in their history have U.S. airlines been in worse shape than they are now . Economic recession has cut deeply into the number of air passengers , slimming the market to a mere shadow of its once lusty self . Eight of the top carriers alone lost $824 million last year . Regional airlines did not do much better as a group . Many of the smaller carriers that initially prospered under fare-cutting schemes encouraged by the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 are now in trouble and may not survive . <P> To lure passengers , the airlines have slashed fares suicidally almost without interruption since last fall . Last week TWA and Capitol Airlines joined United Airlines in offering $99 one-way night flights between New York and San Francisco , which is far less than the going Greyhound bus fare of $ 133 . <P> So far , the rate cutting has almost totally failed in its principal objective : filling up the planes with enough bargain-hungry passengers to return the carriers to profitability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled on scheduled flights , keep going down , from 59.1% in 1980 to 58.7% last year , with some individual airlines in far worse shape . During February , for example , financially ailing Pan Am 's load-factor slipped to 54.8% of capacity , from 60.8% last year , while TWA 's dropped even further in the first two months of this year , to 49.1% . <P> Among the most troubled of all the major carriers are Continental and Braniff , both of which are widely regarded by analysts as close to bankruptcy . At Braniff , sacrifices have become part of the job . Employees took a 10% pay cut in 1981 to help pull the airline out of its slump , and two weeks ago Braniff put its 9,500 employees on half pay for one week to save $8 million after its $94.8 million operating loss in 1981 . <P> Braniff badly needed the wage deferral assistance from its employees to ease a sudden and potentially ruinous cash crunch . The trouble arose when approximately $9 million worth of Braniff tickets were unexpectedly presented for redemption by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house operates like a kind of back-office ticket exchange , allowing reservation agents for one airline to accept tickets for fares written by another carrier . <P> Problems surfaced when rumors started to spread that Braniff was on the verge of bankruptcy . Thousands of passengers holding Braniff tickets panicked and traded them in at ticket offices for seats on BranifFs archrival , American Airlines . Last week allegations were made to the Civil Aeronautics Board by unspecified airline-industry insiders that American let the Braniff tickets accumulate , then abruptly dumped them into the clearinghouse hopper in a " dirty tricks " campaign designed to create a Braniff cash crunch and hasten the airline 's demise . Though American Airlines dismissed the charge as " absolutely ridiculous , " the CAB is looking into the matter anyway .
