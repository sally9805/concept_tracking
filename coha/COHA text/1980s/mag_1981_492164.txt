// THE STRANGE SAGA OF RUDOLPH HESS by Nick Thimmesch One of the strangest consequences of World War II is the case of Rudolph Hess . He was born 86 years ago in Alexandria , Egypt , and after 40 years in prison has yet to die . Most people in the West have forgotten about Hess . Those who think of him at all very likely are waiting for something to happen  --  for Hess to be freed from Spandau prison in West Berlin ; or to fall seriously ill and be rushed to a hospital , where the press would keep vigil during his last days ; or simply to be found dead in bed one morning in his small prison cell . But Hess , the only prisoner left in Spandau , quite remarkably goes on and on , his life unchanged after all these years . He was in prison when war raged in North Africa , Jimmy Doolittle raided Tokyo , millions of Germans and Russians were killed in fierce battles , the Allies triumphed and Adolf Hitler committed suicide . Hess was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was formed , the Iron Curtain descended , Israel was founded , communism conquered China and the Korean war was fought . He sat in Spandau through Milton Berle , Sputnik , the rise of the Common Market , Castro 's taking of Cuba , John F. Kennedy 's election , Charles de Gaulle , Pope John XXIII , the Berlin Wall , Marilyn Monroe 's suicide , the Beatles , German and Japanese economic miracles , Mickey Mantle , Giinter Grass , Konrad Adenauer and Willy Brandt . He was still waiting when the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia , when the United States put men on the moon and 500,000 in Vietnam , when Richard Nixon went to China and when Watergate occurred . As an imprisoned octogenarian , Hess learned that a Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan got elected and learned about Bert Lance , Billy , Camp David agreements and the Olympic boycott . The world moved much in 40 years ; Hess did n't . Hess was known as the Number Two Nazi after Hitler , but that designation had to do more with his title of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had joined the Nazi party in 1920 after being thrilled by a bombastic speech of Hitler 's . He soon became blindly devoted to Hitler and demonstrated his loyalty during the celebrated Munich beerhall Putsch of 1923 . Soon after , he and Hitler were tried as insurrectionists and sent to Landsberg prison , where he helped Hitler write Mein Kampf . When they were released from prison , Hess was virtually Hitler 's private secretary and , in the next eight years , was constantly at his Fillu-er 's side . When Hitler took power in 1933 , therefore , it was not unusual that he made Hess his deputy with powers of attorney in matters concerning Nazi party leadership . Hess was Hitler 's doorkeeper , but he also implemented his master 's wishes in arranging for Nazi control of the universities , schools , religious groups and labor organizations . Hess also played a role in pushing the odious anti-Jewish legislation enacted in 1935 . With such a record of loyalty and obedient performance , Hess could well have become one of the worst of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on May 10 , 1941 , which , to this day , he claims was an unauthorized mission to make peace between Nazi 51 Germany and England . By being captured and jailed by the British that early in the war , Hess avoided participating in the ugliest deeds of Nazism . Consequently , the tribunal at Nuremburg , which tried the leading Nazis , found Hess not guilty of war crimes or of crimes against humanity , but did find him guilty of conspiracy and crimes against peace  --  meaning he was around when the Nazi armies invaded Austria , Poland and the Soviet Union . The Soviets hated Hess and wanted him executed . But the tribunal gave Hess life imprisonment . The Soviets , so obsessed with World War II , have insisted all these years that Hess be given no favors , no leniency and be kept in prison until he dies . The Soviets are adamant , even though all the Allied powers would like to see Hess released on humanitarian grounds . Even Jews who went back to Germany to live after the war say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Colonel Eugene K. Bird ( USA , Retired ) , once the commandant at Spandau and Hess ' biographer . The forgiveness which Colonel Bird attributes to returned German Jews is not shared by the Israelis , however , who remember that Hess was part and parcel of the Nazi regime when crimes were committed against individual Jews and that Hess had a solid record of anti-Semitism . Hess has spent more than two-thirds of his adult life in confinement , 34 years of it in the sizable , foreboding , red-bricked Spandau prison . This century-old structure , with its Gothic windows , cylindrical towers and high-walled grounds , looks like a fortress with dungeons undoubtedly inside . Indeed , until 1947 Spandau still contained an execution chamber with a guillotine and a chambered , tiled floor so the condemned 's blood could wash away . Since September 30 , 1966 , when Albert Speer ( author of Inside the Third Reich ) and Baldur von Schirach ( Nazi Youth leader ) were discharged after serving 20-year terms , Hess has been the only inmate left in Spandau . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past 14 years , a feeble , sickly old man squirreled away in a huge , grim old prison . His quiet presence in Spandau is eerie . The inside enclosures are cavernous , and there is room for 600 prisoners . Administration of the prison is bureaucratic , based on the notion that the four powers which conquered Nazi Germany  --  the U.S. , Britain , France and the Soviet Union  --  are charged with the custody of the Nazi war criminals . This solemn mission requires a staff of 105 , including 37 armed military guards who peer from security towers as though Spandau might be stormed one day by neo-Nazi fanatics . West Germany pays the bill , $1 million a year , to keep Hess locked up . There were several instances when it seemed that the responsibility would be ended . Two of Hess ' four suicide attempts occurred in Spandau ( the others were in a British prison ) , and in 1969 , he came close to death when he had an ulcer burst and was rushed to a hospital in West Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one on earth has been fussed over by doctors more than Rudolph Hess . He has variously been proclaimed an hysteric , an amnesia victim , a schizophrenic and a hopeless , terminal case . In 1966 , three months after Speer was released , the Spandau board of physicians from the four powers met to discuss how long he could be expected to live . According to Colonel Bird , one doctor said he could live a year ; another , less than a year ; the others gave him three years at most . Hess has suffered from infected teeth , an ulcerated stomach , poor circulation , bad kidneys , a weak heart and an enlarged prostate , the surgical removal of which Hess will not consent to . By all accounts , he is a grumpy , hypochondriacal , introverted and often disobedient prisoner . He pushes his warders to the limit . After refusing to eat for days and being confronted with forced feeding ( by funnel and tube ) , Hess suddenly complies and is remorseful . His intransigence seems epic . For many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son to visit , maintaining that to see them would be andignified . Then , on December 24 , 1959 ? more than 18 years after Hess ' " peace " flight to England  --  F'rau use Hess and her son , Wolf-Rudiger Hess , then 32 , entered Spandau . When Hess saw his wife , he kissed her hand , but could not shake it or his son 's when they left because that would be a violation of prison regulations . Hess has been singularly stubborn in refusing to acknowledge any guilt for his role in the Nazi movement . He has admitted that there were excesses against the Jews , but he has never spoken disparagingly about Hitler . This information comes from Colonel Bird , who was a young American guard officer when Hess entered Spandau on July 18 , 1947 . Colonel Bird became fascinated by him and the other six Nazi war criminals , and on being transferred to other duties , including a stint in the Korean war , vowed to return to Spandau one day . When the U.S. commander at Spandau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took command in August 1964 . He remained in command until April 1972 and got to know Hess , Prisoner #7 , extremely well . While Hess ' health , emotional state and moods varied markedly during the many years Bird knew him , Hess ' daily routine as a prisoner did n't . " The Russians do n't change things once they 've agreed on them , " Bird told me earlier this year in West Berlin . " The Russians insist on the instructions and regulations on these prisoners that were formed at the Nuremberg trials . " By Bird 's account , Hess lives a regimented life . He rises at six a.m. , turns on his light and removes the wax earplugs he wears at night to block out sounds from clanging metal doors . He could sleep until seven , but Hess always wakes at six , so he lies in bed until about 6:45 a.m. , when he performs limbering-up and breathing exercises . Then , after muttering " Morgen " to his warder , who has been sleeping nearby , Hess walks slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plods to Cell 8 , the washroom , where he cleans his dentures andshaves with his electric razor . By 7:15 a.m. , Hess is back in his cell , where he gets out of his pajamas and into the prison uniform  --  a black-and-white checkered shirt bearing his " Number Seven , " gray denim trousers and gray socks . At 7:45 , Hess hears a steel door closing , and he knows that his breakfast is on the way as it has been for many years . The rest of the day amounts to cleaning his cell , washing his socks and underwear , a walk in the prison garden , feeding crumbs to the birds , returning to his cell for lunch , writing a letter to his wife or son , a nap , another walk in the garden , being searched on return , dinner at 5 p.m. , a visit to the library cell to choose a book or write notes and then to bed at 10 p.m . The regulations set for the Nazi prisoners at Spandau were drawn up at a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what this cruel regime had done to much of the world . The prisoners were to be virtually robots , speaking only when spoken to ; rising from their beds or chairs when a warder entered their cell and then engaging in discussion only on official matters , no pleasantries ; light switched on in the cells every ten minutes to prevent suicides ; no talking between prisoners at any time ; walking in an orderly , almost military manner when going from cell to prison yard or wherever ; no shaking of hands with visitors  --  these were just some . But according to Speer 's book and from what Bird told me , the regulations were observed in more relaxed fashion after a number of years , particularly when the Americans , French or British were taking their turn at running the prison . The real rigidity on Hess lies in the Kremlin , whose rulers have consistently refused not only direct requests from West German officials for his release , but even tenuous diplomatic " feelers . " Konrad Adenauer asked the Soviets , even during the Cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West German leaders , right up to 1978 when West German President Walter Scheel made a face-to-facerequest of Leonid Brezhnev when the Soviet leader visited Bonn . Over the years , there have been various " Free Rudolph Hess " movements , none of them large and none getting any response which could be regarded as encouraging . Wolf-Rudiger Hess has offered repeatedly to change places with his father , but he does n't even get a comment or reply from the Soviets . Next to the West Germans , the British have been the most active in trying to get Hess freed . The British have never been sympathetic with the Soviet Union anyway , and there has always been the lurking notion that Hess really wanted his Nazi regime to spare the British , make peace with them and turn the German war machine full force on the Soviets  --  a scenario some British Tories would have approved . So it was n't surprising that in 1975 Lord James Douglas-Hamilton demanded that the Soviets consent to releasing Hess , whose virtual solitary confinement , he said , Continued on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal in the House of Commons was applauded by several Labour members of Parliament , and this prompted Roy Hattersley , then Labour 's Number Two man in the Foreign Ministry , to call in the Soviet ambassador and argue forcefully for Hess ' release . The Lord Hamilton who pled Hess ' case in 1975 is the son of the Duke of Hamilton , the man Hess earnestly wanted to see when he landed in Scotland in 1941 . The reason that Hess wanted to see the Duke of Hamilton was that he had been persuaded by a Dr. Albrecht Haushofer that the Duke of Hamilton and a substantial group of British Conservatives would be receptive to the idea of a German-British understanding and possibly to arranging a peace . Dr. Albrecht Haushofer claimed to have known the Duke of Hamilton and many other British " personalities " of the " imperial " persuasion when he was living in England from 1934 to 1938 . Haushofer , a resolute anti-Bolshevik , agreed with his friend Hess that it would be wise to have access to " sensible " Englishmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So Dr. Haushofer wrote the Duke of Hamilton in September 1940 , sending the letter to Lisbon and hoping that it would be relayed to England . The Duke of Hamilton stated later that British intelligence people intercepted the letter and delayed its delivery for months . Anyway , not long after Hess was captured in Scotland , the Duke of Hamilton and two military officers visited Hess for interrogation . The officers complied with Hess ' request that they leave him alone with the duke . According to the Duke of Hamilton ( who died in 1973 ) , Hess told him that he came on a " mission of humanity " and that " the Fiihrer does not want to defeat Englandand wants to stop fighting . " When Hess asked the duke to get the leading members of his ( political ) party together to consider the peace proposals , the duke , then a wing commander with the Royal Air Force , replied that there was now only one party in England . The duke than flew immediately to London to brief Prime Minister Winston Churchill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the duke later recalled , " they thought I had gone mad . - Actually , the top British officials thought Hess had gone mad , but for propaganda purposes announced on the BBC that " Hess is not a nervous disease case .. . . No . He has seen where Hitler is leading the German people and made his decision to leave Hitler alone in the mess . " Hitler , according to the diaries of his chief of staff , was taken by surprise by the Hess flight and was furious . When he calmed down , he ordered that the German media be informed that Hess had gone crazy . Meanwhile , Hitler ordered Dr. Haushofer to write a full report on what had transpired between Germany and England on peace negotiations . Hitler had not turned away suggestions from Hess  --  andtherefore from Albrecht Haushofer  --  that it would be useful for accommodation to be reached with England , particularly because the war against the Soviets was soon to be launched . Haushofer , being a loyal German who agreed with Hitler 's foreign policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ended with a warning that it would be very difficult to develop a personal trust between Berlin and London because " the dispute with Hitlerism is viewed by the mass of the English people as a religious So Hess sat in British prison convinced , Colonel Bird reports , that the British officials who visited him had been drugged by an evil power , " the dread coalition of Jews and Bolsheviks . " Hess came to believe that he , too , was drugged , and later , he told British doctors he had lost his memory . The British , understandably , interrogated Hess a good deal . Bird writes that on May 7 , 1944 , " under constant persuasion , Hess agreed to submit to an intravenous injection of the narcotic , Evipal . He was told that while under its influence , he would remember the past that he had forgotten. - Hess later claimed he faked the session and continued to plead memory loss . When Colonel Bird , in his hundreds of hours of interviews , pressed Hess for details on the flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mission beforehand and whether Hess was involved in plans to invade the Soviet Union  --  well , Hess was painfully slow to respond . It took a long time for Bird to get Hess to acknowledge that he did know about Hitler 's plan to attack the Soviets , Operation Barbarossa . Hitler , of course , was horrified that Hess , in England , might betray him and reveal the plan . Hess did n't , and the Nazi armies invaded the Soviet Union six weeks after Hess landed in Scotland . Hess ' loyalty to Hitler is total . Bird asked him if he had to do it all over again , would he serve under Hitler ? " He looked hard at me over his spectacles , " Bird wrote , " his jaw square and jutting . ' Colonel Bird , of course I would . I would not have wanted to'miss the opportunity of serving under Adolf Hitler as his deputy . I was a dedicated man . ' - Hess never renounced Nazi ideology . He did not recant like Speer and others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drafted a grandiose scheme whereby he would become Germany 's new leader , assisted by scores of Nazi officials ( then in prison like himself ) , a virtual restoration of the Third Reich  --  only without war . Whatever Jews were around would be allowed to enter " protective camps " to avoid " the rage of the German population . " Hess also lamented that after two great world wars , " Jewish power increased : ' and " Bolshevism raises its ugly head . " Without mentioning David Lilienthal by name , Hess noted that " a Jew " headed the Atomic Energy Commission in the U.S. , proof that " the real instrument of power in the hands of the Jew is the Bolshevist . " Hess wrote that 33 years ago , and while his mind-set probably has n't changed , he does n't have the energy or the will now to make such statements again . His hair is gray , but the huge brows over the deep-set blue eyes remain black . He lost his teeth and wears dentures . His weight has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 160 . He sits in the barren cell ( each room about 9 ' x 71/2 ' ) , still groaning at night and in the day , striding with a peculiar forward lean . According to Bird , Hess was not a sociable prisoner but kept his mind alive by developing intense interests . He became enthusiastic about and intrigued with the space exploration activities of the U.S. , especially the several moon shots . A large map of the moon is on his cell wall . Once , when Bird was walking with him in the prison garden , Hess stopped and pointed to the moon shining over a church steeple outside and noted the various seas identifiable to the naked eye . " Is n't it beautiful ? " he asked Bird . " I can not get over it . That man has actually walked on the surface of that moon . " Hess was himself an aviator of some skill . He practiced his takeoff from Germany for Scotland three times before he actually made that celebrated flight . The plane he chose , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His parachute jump was to have been precise enough that he would have landed on the Duke of Hamilton 's estate . He missed and landed on a nearby farm . Over all those years , Hess was allowed to read a given number of newspapers and , since 1969 , has been permitted to view certain TV programs  --  but only newscasts from East Germany , since the Soviets insist he may not view West German news programs . Still , Hess is fairly well informed about how the world has changed . He understood the youth revolution , and the rock songs he heard on the warder 's radio led him to conclude it was protest music . Hess admitted to enjoying the Beatles . He was shown the issue of Playboy with the Speer interview , and Hess was shocked that Speer would allow himself to appear in a skin magazine . He took a strong interest in the trial of Lieutenant William Calley and said it was n't " wise of President Nixon to have set aside his prison sentence . . . he moved too quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anguish . In 1969 , when he was critically ill , his stomach bloated to the point that doctors wanted to give him a saline infusion , Hess agreed to be hospitalized but only after long arguments with Spandau staffers . As he was carried away by stretcher , Hess sobbed to Colonel Bird : " Why do n't they release me ? " he cried , his hands in prayer position and tears on his cheeks . " Why must I suffer so ? I alone tried to bring peace in the world , and for this I must stay here the longest . It is not right . It is not just ! All I want is to go home and die in peace and be buried in the garden . " For Hess to become such a pitiful old man and the surviving symbol of Hitler 's Nazi regime  --  unequaled in this century for carnage and cruelty  --  certainly seemed unlikely when he was reared in comfortable circumstances in Alexandria , Egypt . His father was a German wholesale merchant of good reputation , and Hess had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father could provide . At 12 , he was sent from Egypt to an Evangelical Lutheran school in Germany and five years later was enrolled in a French business school in Switzerland . Next , he joined an export house in Hamburg to serve his apprenticeship and work his way into the family business . Hess , at 20 , seemed destined for a secure , bourgeois life . The First World War changed that . Hess volunteered , was wounded three times  --  none serious  --  and became a pilot as the war came to an end . The war and its outcome , a peace settlement oppressive to Germany , fired Hess into rebellion . In his 21 years of being close to Hitler , Hess was often an alter ego to his ideas for anti-Jewish laws , the building of a powerful German state and military , the aggression against Austria , Poland and the Soviets . Hess has denied , however , that he ever accepted the " Master Race " concept . Those who put the best light on Hess depict him as a romantic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hitler . The Soviet hierarchy and some who suffered grievously under Nazism are less charitable . When I talked with Colonel Bird in Berlin , it was clear that he is preoccupied with the Hess situation  --  indeed , has become his advocate . In 1969 , when Hess ' illness caused him to reflect and open up to Colonel Bird , he told him , " At most , I have only a couple more years to live . Surely , there is no earthly reason why the Russians can not agree to my being let loose . " Two months later , he told Bird : " I am destined to die in prison . It is the Russians ... they are terrible people . " Most of the world has forgotten or does n't know about Rudolph Hess . Occasionally , game players who like to fashion scenarios will lay out a plan where Hess could become critically ill again  --  during the month when it is the U.S. 's turn to run Spandau  --  and rushed to a hospital in West Berlin and then " kidnapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Germans friendly to Hess , and he would be taken to the home of his wife , and somehow the West German government would do nothing about it , and the Soviets would fume . But this is indeed game playing , and it wo n't happen . What is more likely is that when Hess , now 86 and a broken , old man living with nightmares and dreams in his lonely cell , does come to his demise , he could well be the only top Nazi to die and be regarded as a hero by many people who detest Nazism . In that death , Hess would achieve a form of revenge on the Soviets .
