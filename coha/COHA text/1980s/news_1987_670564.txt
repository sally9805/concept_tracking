The Diamonds , the pair ' s favorite characters among the dozen they impersonate in the Ballroom ' s new comedy revue , " Mixed Doubles , " are an unflappably upbeat show-business couple reminiscent of a low-budget Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme . Jackie wears a yellow polyester dress that Ms. Moynihan picked up in a thrift shop for $1. 50 , while Jerry sports oversized , pink-tinted aviator glasses and an insincere grin. // " What ' s really important , " Jerry announces , jazzily snapping his fingers , " is that giving thing , that caring thing , that sharing thing . " The lovebirds go on to offer their all-purpose wedding and bar-mitzvah medley , a ghastly hybridization of " New York , New York " " Sunrise Sunset , " " Like a Virgin " and " The Hustle. " // Like most inspired comic caricatures , the Diamonds are people with whom their creators feel a certain affectionate kinship. // " Adam and I share a love for that old-fashioned , swiftly vanishing world of the Rat Pack , the Friar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moynihan said the other day . " When we get into the Diamonds , we often walk around in them for hours. " // Mr. Green and Ms. Moynihan , who have been performing together professionally since June , are the funniest of the three male-female comedy teams participating in " Mixed Doubles , " which runs at the Ballroom through Sept. 5 . The other duos , also solidly amusing , include Breslau and Tiedemann ( Sharon Breslau and Karl Tiedemann ) , and Semarne and Rennie ( Lauri Semarne and John Rennie ) . Their best skits , which blend topical subject matter with needling psychological banter , look back to the comedy of Mike Nichols and Elaine May , the masters of savagely civilized male-female discourse. // A more hapless pair in Moynihan and Green ' s comic arsenal is a young couple studying to go on " The Newlywed Game " by asking each other typical questions posed on the show . " If your wife had to pick a game that described your last whoopee session , which would it be - twister , poker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young wife asks her husband . By the end of this brutal practice session , the marriage is all but on the rocks . From unhappy newlyweds , the duo metamorphoses into Barry and Rainbow , the unctuous New Age host and hostess of a cable-television program called " The New Age Cosmic Crystal Consciousnesss Visualization Power Show . " Among other antics , Barry and Rainbow trans-channel the voice of a 3 , 000-year-old Chinese waiter who promises " no MSG.

" Why anybody would want to do something else used to be beyond my ken , although I ' ve tempered those views somewhat. " // Unlike Ms. Moynihan , Mr. Green said he thinks of himself as a writer first and performer second. // " In order to go on the stage , I had to overcome a certain amount of embarrassment , " he admitted . " We started doing our sketches for friends at dinner parties , and they kept telling us we should do them in public . Finally , after two years of avoidance , we booked ourselves at the Trocadero in the Village and packed the place with friends. " // Ms. Moynihan comes to comedy as a lapsed rock-and-roller .

At least for now , they plan to continue performing together. // " I ' ve worked up about 25 different characters over the years , and I want to try more of them out , " Ms. Moynihan said. // Mr. Green has overcome his initial shyness . " We always have a good time with each other , " he said . " While we ' re not about to drop our other projects , we want to keep this going. " // The Ballroom is at 253 West 28th Street .
