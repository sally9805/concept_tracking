In essence , the Fahd plan does not differ basically from the general position that the moderate Arab states have maintained since the Rabat summit in 1974 . The eight-point proposal contains some elements that clearly are acceptable to all sides , some that appear negotiable and others that now seem to defy all efforts at compromise . The points and the problems they pose : <P> &gt; Israel 's withdrawal from all Arab territories that it occupied after the 1967 war . This territory includes the Gaza Strip , the Golan Heights and , most important , the West Bank of the Jordan River and East Jerusalem , which the Palestinians claim as their own . The Israelis have said that they would give up some of the land if they could be assured defensible borders , but they are adamant about retaining all of Jerusalem . The hard-line Palestinians claim that they would not relinquish a square inch to the Israelis . But there is room for discussion on this point . <P> &gt; The dissolution of Israel 's settlements on land occupied since 1967 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the communities must go . The Israelis argue that the settlements are necessary for the security of their eastern border . They also stress that this is the biblical land of Israel and that Jews therefore have an ancient and inalienable right to settle there . <P> &gt; Guaranteed freedom of worship in all holy places . This has never been a problem in the past and is not one now . <P> &gt; The right of Palestinians to return to their homeland , with compensation for those who choose not to . The question is : the right to return to what ? If the principle is meant to apply to all of the former mandate of Palestine , Israel could not possibly accept the proposal , since it would involve much of Israel 's present territory . If the right of return is limited to the West Bank , however , the point might be negotiable . As for compensation , the Israelis would not pay it , but the wealthy gulf states might if they wanted the plan to work . <P> &gt; United Nations supervision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Palestinians favor this principle . The Israelis would agree to a transition period , but not under the U.N . Prime Minister Menachem Begin 's government feels that the U.N . would be controlled by an anti-Israeli bloc . <P> &gt; The establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital . This is the crux , and the main sticking point , of the whole plan . The Israelis reject the notion of an independent Palestinian state out of hand . The Palestinians insist on statehood as the sine qua non of any peace agreement . One possible compromise : the P.L.O . might conceivably accept an entity in confederation with Jordan in order to get around Israeli objections , but only after receiving solid assurances of full and independent statehood in the future . <P> &gt; Right of all states in the region to live in peace . President Reagan and others have stressed that this implies recognition of Israel 's existence , something that no Arab country apart from Egypt has ever granted . The Israelis endorse peaceful coexistence , but they insist that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any declaration of that principle . On the Arab side , only the Libyans and the P.L.O . hard-liners reject the notion of peaceful coexistence with Israel .
