HONG KONG  --  Many of Asia ' s stock markets rose impressively in this year ' s first quarter , but investment professionals say that with the exception of Japan , it isn ' t clear how long Asian equities will sustain their rebound . At the three-month mark , however , several markets already had exceeded some analysts ' expectations for the whole year . Stock prices rose more than 25% in both Taiwan and Thailand , and almost as much in South Korea and Japan . Over the remainder of this year , analysts consider the Tokyo market the world ' s safest because it is being buoyed by a booming domestic economy and plenty of investment cash from home and abroad . Money managers expect Japanese share prices to remain high in coming months even if they don ' t climb much beyond the market ' s current evel . To varying degrees , prospects for the rest of the region ' s markets hinge on the fortunes of Wall Street , where uncertainty about the U.S. economy remains high . Fears of an imminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy in fact is expanding too fast . Such a development would complicate efforts to reduce the U.S. trade deficit , further weaken the dollar and make higher inflation and interest rates more likely . Higher interest rates not only would deal a blow to U.S. stock prices , but would hasten the onset of a recession that many economists consider necessary for the U.S. to reverse its trade imbalances and stabilize its currency . " Things are confusing in the U.S. , " says David Harding , a director at Thornton Management ( Asia ) Ltd. in Hong Kong . " It fluctuates daily between fear of inflation or recession . Right now the greater danger is inflation and higher interest rates . " The U.S. remains by far the largest market for Asia ' s exports despite a recent surge in Asian sales to Japan and Europe , and a U.S. recession inevitably would mean slower growth and weaker stock markets in Asia ' s exporting economies . Some analysts believe smaller Asian markets are set to move within a narrow range because current prices already are discounting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that stock markets historically have hit their lowest levels near the middle of recessionary periods  --  a view that suggests Asian equities , with the likely exception of Japan , could slide sharply again if the U.S. enters a real economic slowdown . In the meantime , analysts say the first quarter illustrates that fewer generalizations apply to all the region ' s smaller markets in the new bearish climate . " Every single market has its own internal factors , " says one . " There is one safe generalization : After the crash , money managers now prefer big stocks in big markets , and if they invest in smaller markets , they invest in big , well-known stocks there . " The Bangkok market has attracted by far the most international attention among smaller markets this year , which helped raise the Securities Exchange of Thailand ' s composite index 26. 7% in the quarter . The country ' s economy is strong , and it is less reliant on the U.S. as an export market than others in the region . Taiwan ' s market did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of March 31 . Awash in cash , investors in Taiwan have fueled a speculative recovery in share prices , and international mutual funds focusing on the country ' s restricted market continue to trade at premiums approaching 100% . Analysts are growing wary of Taiwan equities , however , particularly because of the country ' s heavy dependence on the U.S. as a market for its exports and the growth of speculation . Like Taiwan , South Korea ' s market is closed to direct foreign investment , which has helped keep mutual funds invested there trading at similarly high premiums . Seoul ' s composite index rose 20% in the quarter , surpassing its 1987 high . International money managers expect the market to stay strong , but many are cautious about its prospects for significant gains . In Hong Kong , the Hang Seng index ' s 9. 48% gain in the quarter comes on the heels of a particularly strong performance in December . The market bottomed early that month , and through March had gained more than 30% . Analysts disagree about the market ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that property prices will continue to rise , which should support the market because property-related issues dominate it . Others believe Hong Kong ' s inflation rate , which at 7% is among the region ' s highest , will force interest rates higher and put pressure on share prices , particularly those of property shares . Singapore exports a higher proportion of sophisticated products such as personal computers , which aren ' t expected to be affected as much by a sag in U.S. consumer demand . Still , Singapore ' s market has been subdued by low volume . The Straits Times index climbed 11. 08% . Malaysia , whose economy is based to a large extent on exports of commodities such as rubber and palm oil , began the year on an uncertain note as the prices of raw materials fell on fears of recession . Recently , many commodities prices have begun to rise again , which helped Kuala Lumpur ' s composite index rise 8. 71% . In Australia , higher commodity prices gave the market a strong finish for the quarter , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in big industrial nations could give prices a lift . For the quarter , Sydney ' s AllShares index rose 6. 77% . New Zealand ' s market , reflecting the country ' s slow domestic economy , also recovered later than other markets in the Asia-Pacific region . The Barclays index closed the quarter up 2. 58% . Higher commodity prices didn ' t help stock prices in the Philippines in the quarter . Maintaining a downward slide that began before last year ' s global crash , the composite index lost 9. 24% . Continued political unrest and a growing trade deficit helped fuel the decline.  --  - World Market Activity Tokyo share prices eased during the afternoon session Friday to end mixed .
