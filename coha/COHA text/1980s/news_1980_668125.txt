Brett ' s a hero again , and a winner at last NEW YORK - In 1976 , he ' d hit a game-tying homer and then watched Yankee fans tear up the stadium infield and each other after Chris Chambliss had won the playoffs with a ninth-inning blast . Two autumns later , he had clouted three home runs in the final game , but wound up sitting dejectedly on a stool in a losers ' dressing room , his team a victim of Thurman Munson ' s 430-footer into the monuments in left-center . But last night , the honor and the glory and the spoils belonged to George Brett , whose dramatic three-run seventh-inning home run gave the Kansas CityRoyals the American League championship . Brett hit it off the best , off Goose Gossage , the man with the 96- mile-an- hour fastball , Mr. Intimidation of the New York Yankees . It was a confrontation similar to the Red Sox-Yankee playoff of 1978 , whenGossage faced Carl Yastrzemski . Brett hit the first pitch and popped it up - into the third deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson . Brett knew Gossage would not mess around with any trick pitches . It is not his style . A fastball pitcher against a fastball hitter . " I knew I couldn ' t hit a home run to left-center , not in this park , so I said to myself , Go ahead and try to pull it . ' " The only reason to doubt that the drive might be out of the playing field was Jackson ' s reaction in right . He circled back as though he might get under the ball , but it was only the frustrated move of a great player who had forgotten to get his Mr. October cape out of the cleaners ' . " When I hit that , " said Brett , " I knew the playoffs were ours . " Brett had been oozing confidence since the start of this thing , saying things would be different this time , that the Yankees ' domination of theRoyals was over . He didn ' t harp on the revenge theme , but kept saying that what was past had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him one day of something that had happened in the ' 77 playoffs , he had told the second baseman , " Don ' t talk about it . I don ' t want to be reminded of anything but the next game . " So how did he feel now , grinning and shouting and pouring champagne over the jubilant Mr. and Mrs. Ewing Kauffman , owners of the Royals ? " The best . I don ' t know what hitting .400 would have been like , but it couldn ' t be much better than I ' m feeling right now . " There was , of course , the Yankee eighth , a creepy-crawly inning forRoyals ' reliever Dan Quisenberry , who slings the ball like a man emerging from the subway . A Bob Watson triple and two walks had loaded the bases with none out and Rick Cerone at the plate . " I was sure Watson would score , " said Brett , " and I knew Cerone hits Quisenberry good . " Brett said he hoped the ball would come to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounder . " I thought about stepping on third , throwing to second and then having the relay go to first for a triple play . It would really have been my night then . " No triple play , but a little luck . Cerone ' s liner went just to the right of shortstop U.L. Washington , who glided over , made the catch and doubled up Jackson at second . " I gave it a nice little throw , " said Washington . " Not too much on it , just enough . " Washington , who had set up the Brett home run by beating out an infield hit ( " I don ' t get the big hits , I get the little hits that bring the guy up who gets the big hits " ) said he felt the air go out of the stadium with the double play . The fans buried their heads , all right , and Cerone almost tore his off in frustration . The Yankee catcher had gone perhaps a half-dozen steps toward first when Washington corraled his liner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scale it into the grandstand . He stopped and looked at his helmet , then back at home plate , as though plate umpire Larry McCoy was going to call him back and let him try again . Cerone started to drive his helmet at the ground again , but once more checked himself . He looked back one more time at the field , at opportunity denied , and walked slowly toward the dugout . Two feet from the steps , he finally got rid of the frustration - slamming his helmet against the concrete and then booting it along the dugout floor . So the team that won more games than any other club in baseball has been dispatched from the 1980 season in three straight games . And it was fitting that George Brett , the shoved-aside hero of two other final games here at The Stadium , should be the one who finally put out thelights . George Steinbrenner can ' t pin this one on the third base coach , but you can bet he ' ll find somebody to blame .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
