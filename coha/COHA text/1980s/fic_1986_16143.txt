FADE IN : OCEAN CITY , MARYLAND - 1966 CLOSE ON the top of a large circular table . It is covered with a starched white cloth . A HAND places a blue edged plate down on one edge and follows it swiftly with five others . Now forks , then knives and spoons . CREDITS BEGIN : as glasses are added . The table is set formally with two forks and large and small spoons . Now the same hands begin to fold a square of starched white cloth . They move with great dexterity . In only two or three moves the cloth emerges shaped like a large white bird . It is placed on the first plate . The others are added in swift succession . Now a vase of fresh picked wildflowers is added at the center of the table . Then on either side of it , an ornate salt and pepper shaker and a sugar bowl . Finally the table is finished and the CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal THE YOUNG WAITRESS ( AUGUSTA ) ( about 18 ) who just finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a small plaid apron and matching cap . She surveys her work and turns to check the other tables in the large room . There are about twenty others set in an identical manner . THE ROOM is pleasant and sunny . Wooden floors are underfoot and huge windows look out onto the beach and ocean just a few yards away . Another girl ENTERS from the swinging double doors at the end of the room . She carries a large tray on which are a pile of silver creamers . This is TAMMY . CREDITS END &nbsp; TAMMYAnnette wants these cleaned before they 're put out . She says the silver is in the utility room .  --  3  --  &nbsp; AUGUSTA SAWYER ( anguished ) Oh God , Tammy . I 'm gon na be so late ! ! If you finish this for me , I 'll take Saturday night for you . &nbsp; TAMMYYou will ? &nbsp; AUGUSTA SAWYER ( already halfway across the floor and unbuttoning her uniform as she goes ) See you Thursday . We 'll split tips then . She 's gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not working Saturday night . INT . BATHROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER The space is small for the procedure Augusta is performing in it . She moves quickly , urgently . We will come to see that this is how she does most things . The hardest thing for her to do is slow down . She is wearing only her panties and the hat from her uniform . On the toilet is her purse and she is removing from it a pair of jeans and a bathing suit . She struggles into them and stuffs the uniform and " sensible shoes " she 's removed into the purse in their place , but not before dumping the pocket full of change in her uniform pocket directly into her purse . Now she looks into the mirror and begins to pull the pins from her hair that hold the uniform cap in place . Her dark curly hair falls as the cap comes off and she tosses her head to set it in place . Out of the pocket of her jeans she removes some silver dangle earrings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all wore in the late sixties . The earrings go and a smudge of black eye liner complete her conversion . She surveys herself in the mirror . She 's got spirit instead of ordinary prettiness and she seems to know this , but is n't sure what to make of it . She pulls at her face to make it look a little more conforming and then gives up . She looks around the room one last time to see if she 's forgotten anything and then reaches deep into her sack of a purse and pulls out a plastic flat case that could contain only one thing ( a diaphragm ) hesitates a second and starts to unzip her jeans .  --  4  --  EXT . BOARDWALK - DAY Augusta makes her way through the boardwalk crowd of strolling families sporting Ocean City T-shirts , groups of teenage boys ogling the groups of teenage girls .

THE CAR - AUGUSTA 'S POV out the window as she approaches a picturesque dock . The Stones play on the radio . The car comes to a stop . EXT . A SMALL DOCK - DAY Several fishing boats are docked there as well as a variety of smaller pleasure sailing craft . All the boats are funky - paint peeling - wooden - owned by area residents , not visitors , except for a fleet of rental sailboats . Augusta runs up the wharf . Her purse is still slung over her shoulder , but she is clutching a sleeping bag . She stops in front of a small sailboat and looks around for someone . No one is visible until a head of curly dark hair emerges from below , followed immediately by a tattered sweatshirt and jeans , all of which belong to HENRY SQUIRES , 19 . He 's very attractive . Not at all pretty , but sexy in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what they want . &nbsp; AUGUSTA SAWYER ( nervous ) Sorry I 'm late .

They maneuver out of the dock area and are sailing free now . From their POV we can see the little resort community get further away . The amusement park with its ferris wheel and roller coaster are visible . It 's quiet on the water and for a few beats neither of them speak . &nbsp; HENRY SQUIRES ( finally ) What 'd you tell your mother ? &nbsp; AUGUSTA SAWYERThat I was going camping on Assateague.  --  6  --  &nbsp; HENRY SQUIRESWith me ? &nbsp; AUGUSTA SAWYERNot with you , fool .

KITCHEN - MORNING We are in Henry Squires ' home and his wife RUTH is busy in a kitchen that is full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinets full of colorful pottery and dishes . Splashes of primitive design provided by weavings and baskets adorn the walls . Odd shaped containers and old kitchen implements are in interesting places and it all looks used ; lived with . This is the home of a good cook , not the show place of a designer . Ruth Squires is making eggs at the old stove . Henry and Addy sit at the old pine table , the kind that started out painted green and has been stripped on a succession of Sunday 's of its camouflage . &nbsp; RUTH SQUIRESAddy , if you want hot sauce with your eggs , it 's in the pantry . Ruth is not bad looking , although her natural roundness has turned into plumpness , her good spirits , energy and a variety of colors ( her red hair , her blue eyes and her grace with fabrics ) leave you with the impression of attractiveness and warmth .

I have n't covered anything more exciting than the unveiling of an ad kiosk at the corner of Ocean and 24th Streets . I would n't know where to begin . &nbsp; AUGUSTA SAWYERGet off it , Henry .

He bends down and puts his hand in her shirt , unbuttons it . Then : A GUN SHOT They both sit up . Alarmed . &nbsp; HENRY SQUIRES ( getting up ) Stay here . &nbsp; AUGUSTA SAWYERI certainly will not . She 's on her feet following him into the brush . There 's another SHOT . They move on towards it . They 're walking through woodsy undergrowth . It 's the kind of dry sticks that scratch your face even when you are trying to be careful . They are moving fast and both of them are getting scratched up . They pass through into an area of pine forest and all of a sudden the undergrowth is gone .  --  80  --  It 's very beautiful and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees and they pass in and out of them as they move like children in an enchanted forest - like Hansel and Gretel . Then they 're back in the undergrowth and climbing . Augusta slips a few times because she 's trying to protect her camera . Then , without warning , there 's a break in the trees and they can see below them what was the source of the shots . THEIR POV TWO MEN in a jeep have built a temporary corral and are herding ponies into it . The gun shots were to confuse and direct the animals into the fences . The herd leader is kicking at the side trying to get out , but it is too high for him . The others picking up his nervousness are in danger of hurting each other in the enclosed space . Several of the ponies have foals standing near them .

She 's switched into her work mode without even noticing . She is working on instinct now . Henry is amazed . She has n't noticed . She starts inching slowly down the hill , trying to stay under the cover . Henry stays right behind . Finally they arrive down on level ground . They are behind the two men and blocked by the jeep . The horses are skittish and are making enough noise to cover for Augusta and Henry . Augusta tries for a picture , but ca n't get an angle from where she is.  --  81  --  &nbsp; AUGUSTA SAWYERI got ta get closer to the jeep . &nbsp; HENRY SQUIRESThey 'll kill us . &nbsp; AUGUSTA SAWYERThey might . They 're creeps . Slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is directly behind the jeep . HER POV - THROUGH HER CAMERA LENS The man stands with the tranquilizer gun in his hand aimed at the horse . The horse is rearing at the fence , at the man . She click off a picture . Now the man shoots . The horse topples and falls to the ground . The man goes over to take a look . &nbsp; MANThat 'll quiet ' em . Augusta clicks off another shot . She heads back to Henry and they begin to climb again . She turns for a shot of the whole scene . The horse lies on the ground , the men stand looking him over . The other horses mill about . As she crouches to take the shot , the ground gives way beneath her and she falls about five feet . This time the noise is too much . The men see her and start up the slope . One of them fires a few warning shots into the air . Henry reaches down and lifts her up and almost carries her to the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . &nbsp; AUGUSTA SAWYERThey 'll take the film . We got ta get out of here . SHOTS OF THE TWO OF THEM - RUNNING Through the underbrush . The men follow . Now through THE PINE WOODS Shots ring out again . Augusta is startled and falls . She calls out . &nbsp; AUGUSTA SAWYERHenry . He comes back for her . Helps her to her feet . Picks up the camera . They 're very tired . They 're back in  --  82  --  THE UNDERBUSH now . Their faces are scratched . They move forward . The noises behind them are gone . Maybe they 're safe . They emerge into THE CLEARING and parked in front of them are the two men in the jeep . &nbsp; MAN #1Practicing for the marathon are you ? Henry and Augusta have nothing to say . &nbsp; MAN #1I do n't like having my picture taken . I hope I do n't have to persuade you to give me that camera and move on .

A few kids too . Augusta leans against the railing and takes shots with a smaller version of the camera we saw before . This time has a long lens . Her sister Sally stands next to her carrying her baby . She holds it up as if to give it a better view . &nbsp; SALLY ( to the baby ) See Daddy . Wave to Daddy . She moves the baby 's hand for her .

The gun GOES OFF and the race starts . Immediately , the swimmers spread out . Some are really good and others are doing this just for the fun - like a good marathon run . Reads bob in the water and kids on surf boards paddle along side to aid any swimmers in trouble . The leaders head out towards the end of the pier and on the pier the watching crowd follows them . Augusta and Sally move with the others towards the end of the pier . The swimmers round the pier and start back . The course is circumnavigating the pier .
