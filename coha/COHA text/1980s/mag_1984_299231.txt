Three summer movies offer more of the same old thing <P> RHINESTONE She ( Dolly Parton ) is a country singer itching to escape from her predatory manager . He ( Sylvester Stallone ) is a Noo Yawk cab driver with both feet recklessly pressed on the accelerator pedal of life . East is East and South is South and never the twang shall meet , right ? Not if you are familiar with Hollywood 's perennial passion for cross-pollinating ethnic strains . Before you can say " Kinky Friedman and the Texas Jewboys , " the country kitten has made a bet with her manager that in two weeks she can turn this city rat into a down-home singing star . Anyone who has trouble predicting the order and outcome of each succeeding scene in this amiable airhead of a movie will be required to stay after class and read Pygmalion 100 times . <P> A very few films become hits because of their originality ; Rhinestone harbors no such subversive motives . It means to breed familiarity without contempt by putting two proven stars through paces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visits Dolly 's Tennessee home town and feels like an alien among bohunks ( as in TV 's Green Acres ) . Dolly tangles with her alcoholic ex-singing partner , who is also her ex-husband ( as in Tender Mercies ) . Dolly teaches Sly to move country-style ( as in the Let 's Hear It for the Boy sequence from Footloose ) . Sly belts out Little Richard 's rave-up Tutti-Frutti before an incredulous audience ( as in another of this week 's culture clashes , Top Secret ! ) . <P> Bob Clark , a journeyman among movie genres ( Murder by Decree , Tribute , Porky 's , A Christmas Story ) , directs the script by Phil Alden Robinson and Stallone to its pre-arranged destination without many bumps or scenic side trips . Tim Thomerson wrings some sweetly comic juice from his role as Dolly 's conniving ex ; and Stallone , who as a singer seems to have taken charisma lessons from his songwriter brother Frank , is game and good-spirited in a role that plays too heavily on urban oafishness . Rhinestone , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence , cute and cuddlesome and just a mite raunchy , a sort of Daisy Mae West . And when she sings , " I would let my gentle bosom/ Be the pillow for your head , " she reminds us that her body is a statuesque amalgam of art and nature . All together now : two cheers for Dolly ! - By Richard Corliss <P> TOP SECRET ! Captured by the East German secret police , Nick Rivers ( Val Kilmer ) , an American rock star turned secret agent , is being tortured . This happens off-camera , but we have some idea of his suffering because one of his tormentors has been introduced as " a moron who knows only what he reads in the New York Post , " and he has been observed , tabloid in hand , slobbering . Our worst fears are confirmed when we learn Nick has not cracked and an escalation of his agony is required . " Do you want me to bring out the LeRoy Neiman paintings ? " an underling asks the general in charge , his voice hushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
