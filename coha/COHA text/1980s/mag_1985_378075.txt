The heavily guarded brick-and-stone courthouse in Auckland was jammed with journalists , lawyers and policemen . At 10:31 a.m. , Judge Ronald Gilbert entered the chamber , followed moments later by Defendants Dominique Prieur , 36 , and Alain Mafart , 35 . For the two French intelligence agents , the long-awaited preliminary inquiry was finally under way . At issue : whether the pair would have to face trial for murder and arson in the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior , the flagship of the Greenpeace environmental movement , in Auckland harbor last July 10 . <P> Last September French officials belatedly admitted that unnamed secret-service frogmen had carried out the attack , in which a photographer died , to keep the ship from protesting French nuclear tests on the Pacific atoll of Mururoa . The incident had badly shaken the administration of Socialist President Franois Mitterrand and forced the abrupt departures of two senior government officials . Last week 's hearing was expected to reveal new details in the convoluted affair . <P> Then , in a surprise move , New Zealand Solicitor-General Paul Neazor declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French agents to manslaughter since the defendants had acted only " in support of those who actually placed the explosives .

Greenpeace Chairman David McTaggart denounced the hearing as a " very low level " of justice . Said the conservative French daily Le Quotidien de Paris : " After smothering the repercussions of the Greenpeace affair , the Socialists are today benefiting from New Zealand justice . " <P> Though Prime Minister David Lange 's government denied that there was any deal , suspicions were reinforced by French officials . Defense Minister Paul Quils confirmed in a TV interview that there had been behind-the-scenes " contacts " between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allow me to be discreet . " That prompted Lange to snap , " It 's so discreet that no one in Wellington knows about them . " To be sure , questions remained , such as precisely who ordered the action and who carried it out , but the Greenpeace affair seemed to be finally sputtering out .
