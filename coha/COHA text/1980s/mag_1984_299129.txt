A show in New York City provides an elegant primer on drawing <P> The exhibition called " Reading Drawings " that is now on view at the Drawing Center in New York City is as elegant a teaching show as one might wish to see . Why study drawings at all ? <P> Because they are often the clearest index to a painter 's intentions ; finished or fragmentary , they are the deposit left by the process of image forming , the residue of the darlings and probings that constitute pictorial thought . <P> Through them we are made privy to the sight of Rubens inventing half a dozen variations on a given arm until the right one clicks ; to that of Watteau , infatuated with the silky passage of red chalk over paper , building up his stock of memory images and usable prototypes for later consumption . Looking at drawings seems an even more private affair than studying paintings . Drawings never lie about skill . <P> They are merciless little witnesses , like children . They reveal whatever is obsessive , mutable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Painters have always collected other painters ' drawings , to give themselves access to the code of imaginations they admire . Yet the first museum show of Old Master drawings ( let alone ones by living artists ) seems to have happened only about 100 years ago , in Berlin in 1881 . It is a sign of the times that , for all the didactic efforts museums have put into photography over the past decade , showing how to deduce the complex intentions of what was once thought the simple truth of a photographic instant , very little of the sort has been done for the older and far deeper art of drawing . For one thing , the prestige of real graphic discipline has inexorably sunk in the art schools . The idea that drawing is anything more than a preliminary step to painting-that a mark on paper could , in its own right , achieve a density , finish , intensity and even grandeur as full as one on canvas-has withered in the face of facile generalizations about " major " and " minor " statements . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A century ago , most educated people drew as a matter of course because it was the best way to remember what they saw . Great Aunt Lucinda with her watercolor set , earnestly dabbling in the shade of the Duomo , may have been a figure of mild fun ; but she ( multiplied by tens of thousands ) was also the ground from which the tremendous graphic achievements of a Degas or a Matisse could rise . Such amateur experience added up to a general recognition that to draw , to reconstitute a motif as a code of lines and tonal patches , is to think , and that such thought forms the root of all visual literacy . A stroll in SoHo today , by contrast , will furnish any number of artists who can barely trace , let alone draw .
