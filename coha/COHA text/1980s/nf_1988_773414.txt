txt 90 / Thinking The problem that proponents of behaviorism must face is that no particular behavior is required of one who has this or that thinking . For example , consider people who believe that a bear is wandering about uncaged in their vicinity . This may lead them to remove themselves , but only if they also desire safety and believe they have no power to control the bear . Those who believe they are bear trainers , or believe that bears can be transfixed by a steady stare , and those who desire a speedy and spectacular death may not leave the vicinity , but may approach the bear or even try to raise its ire . Again , those who are hungry may eat good food , but they may not do so if they believe the food to be poisoned or consecrated . These examples show that one thinking does not lead to a bit of behavior ; at best a whole set of thinkings does so . Looking at the same point from the side of behavior we can see also that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even any whole set of thinkings . For example , people who drink a glass of beer may believe it 's beer and desire to slake their thirst ; or they may not be thirsty at all but only trying to commit suicide in the ( false ) belief that what they are drinking is nitric acid ; or they may believe ( truly or falsely ) that their drinking is part of a sacred rite ; or they may not be thirsty but believe that beer will cure some ailment they have ; and so on , and so on . We can sum up the point of these examples in the charge that behavior can not determine thinkings , since no behavior is either necessary or sufficient for any thinking . Further , if we try to add something to behavior to connect it with thinkings , what we must add is other thinkings . This makes the project of behaviorism ? that is , the exhibiting of behavior and dispositions toward behavior as determinative of thinkings ? appear circular . I shall let this appearance give a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer to it as the circularity problem . The circularity problem will be with us a long time . The first step toward solving it is to relocate it as a problem about what people say . To do this we will need to make some preliminary points about thinkings . We can introduce these points by considering the following claim about the Truth of Thinking-Attributions . ( TTA ) Let T be an attribution of some thinking to S , where the thinking can be characterized by " p " . Then T is true just in case S behaves like a person who says " p " . The obvious objection that will be raised against this is that it presupposes that there is something that counts as behaving like a person who says " p " . Indeed , one might simply rephrase a point already made and assert that there is nothing that a person who says " p " has to do . his is , of course , correct . Nonetheless , in the next section I shall plain and defend the view that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a person who says " p " . For the moment I wish to ass me that I can make good on this and show what progress , small though it is , this assumption now allows us . We can express our version of behaviorism a little more formally in the following way . ( B ) For each thinking-attribution T there is some way of behaving W such that T holds of a subject S just in case S behaves in the way W. If we try to specify W in terms of single actions , like running away or drinking , we can not get substituends that make ( B ) true . If we limit ourselves to such action descriptions and try to add things to make ( B ) flue , we fall into circularity because what we have to add are further thinkings . But ( B ) does not rule out a different kind of specification of W ; and ( TTA ) provides a specification of a subject 's behavior that ( as we shall see ) makes ( B ) true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following question . How could there be any use in being told what people 's thinkings are , if all we are really told is that they behave like p-sayers and we are not given any description of what it is to behave like this ? To answer this we 92. / Thinking must first think of cases in which we are present when people say things . Others ' words have effects on us , of which we may usefully distinguish four kinds . First , people may express what they want . For example , they may say " Please turn the heat up . " This may induce us to act , either to satisfy or to frustrate their want . Expression of a believing may prompt us to immediate behavior , for example , our own expression of a contrary view . Or someone 's declaration that she has just seen a professional pickpocket leave the room may lead us to check our pockets . In a second kind of case , our response may be delayed . For example , a candidate 's statements may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it until election day . In a third kind of case , our response may be not only delayed but contingent upon some further behavior of the speaker . For example , I may be given to understand that my friend wishes to meet eligible women . This may produce nothing noticeable ; but when , on a later occasion , he says that he finds so and so attractive it may have its effect by being part of what leads me to make an introduction . The fourth kind of case is a species of the third ; that is , it involves a certain kind of delayed response that is contingent upon a particular kind of further behavior of the speaker . The particular kind of behavior that is ( definitionally ) required for this kind of case is behavior that is inconsistent with earlier behavior . The required response is an accusation that someone 's behavior is inconsistent . " Inconsistent " here does not , of course , mean " logically inconsistent " ( although uttering logical inconsistencies is a special case of it ) ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers a wide range of inappropriate sequences of behavior.9 It is natural , in this last sort of case , to speak of expectations . We g . My use of inconsistency and appropriateness ( of behavior ) here is not questionbegging , although it may appear so . Inconsistent or inappropriate behavior occurs if S says " p " , or gives us reason to treat S like a p-sayer , but does not later act like a psayer . This of course presupposes that there is such a thing as behaving like a person who says " p " . But , as I have said , I am assuming this in the present section . I shall argue for it in the next section . Thinking / 93 must , however , be careful to note that an expectation is just a state of a person that will causally contribute to making an objection or charge of inconsistency upon some future occurrence ( which , of course , will be described as " what was not expected " ) . In particular , we must bear in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articulatable ? by those who have them . We do not typically go about asserting , even to ourselves , all that we expect of others ; we often discover what we have expected only by finding ourselves inclinFd to think that some observed behavior is inconsistent with some past performance . Let us return o our question about what good could be done by being told what others think , when this does not describe what they will do . The key lies in noticing that the responses and expectations that we have to people 's saying things in our presence can be evoked by reports of what they have said . Thus , we may adjust the thermostat ( up or down ) by being told that someone wants the heat turned up . We may check our pockets if someone tells us that Jones has just said that a pickpocket was here . We may vote for people on the strength of reports of what they say . If a third party tells me that my friend has said he wants to meet people , that will prompt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may find people 's behavior inconsistent with what I have been told they have said . Now , reports of what people say do not describe what they will do but there should by now be no surprise in the fact that there is a point to them . What they do is to mobilize in us the responses and expectations that we would have had if we had actually heard the subjects of reports say what they are reported to have said . My further claim is that this is also the function of reports of what people think . These do not , of course , imply that people actually said the words in which their thinkings are reported ( neither is it implied that they did not say them ) ; but otherwise the functions of the two kinds of report are the same . We could express this view of the function of reports of thinkings by saying that they invite hearers to treat subjects of the reports as if 94 / Thinking they had said the sentence in which the thinking is reported . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in subsequent discussions I shall refer to the function of reports of thinkings as being to invite us to pretend that the subject of the report has said " p " , where p is the sentence that characterizes the thinking that is reported . This will always mean that the function of reports of thinkings is to invite us to allow our responses and expectations to act in our lives just as if we had heard the subjects say " p " ( whether or not we believe they actually said " p " ) . I shall draw some consequences of this view of the function of reports of thinkings below . First , however , we must return to the circularity problem and defend our presuppositions about saying and behavior . Language and Normalcy The circularity problem , in the form we now have to consider it , is this . ( TTA ) presupposes that there is such a thing as behaving like a person who has recently said " p " . But , it seems , people can say " p " and go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say " p " and also say " q " may behave quite differently from those who say " p " and also say " r " . These latter may in turn behave differently from those who say " r " but do not say " p " . So it looks as if no saying of anything would be more closely associated with one kind of behavior than it would be with indefinitely many others and that , therefore , no behavior counts as " behaving like a person who says p ' " . We may add that these problems arise without any suggestion that sayings may be insincere . Recognizing this possibility only makes the connection between a saying and further behavior more tenuous . The solution to this problem lies in attending to certain facts involving normal conditions . Some of these are very general and are closely connected with the conditions for our survival . For example , people who are exposed to inclement weather normally wear protective clothing or else do things that bring them closer to being Thinking / 95 sheltered . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food into their stomachs . People who have not slept for more than sixteen hours normally do things that bring them closer to being able to sleep . Healthy people who have not had sex for more than two weeks normally do things that increase the probability of their having sexual relations in the forseeable future . It would be a mistake to object to these claims by pointing out that someone co Id stand naked in the cold as a penance , or go on a hunger strike , o play Pac Man for forty hours , or take a vow of celibacy . For the above claims state what is normally the case , not what is always th case . It would be just as mistaken to suggest that what one should really say is that the exposed normally do what they believe will protect or shelter them , that the hungry normally do what they believe will get food into their stomachs , and so on . These are normalcy claims and they are true ; but they are weaker than the ones to which I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to succeed in getting protected when they are exposed , in getting food into their stomachs when hungry , in getting sleep after a long day , and in doing things that increase the likelihood of having sexual relations.lo A second kind of normalcy claim is concerned with the Normal Effects of Utterances . I shall begin by stating it . Explanations will follow . ( NEU For many p , there is at least one circumstance C and an effect E such that ( i ) C can be specified without reference to the thinkings of those who utter " p " , and ( ii ) normally , when people utter " p " in C , E ensues . ro . It follows that what people believe concerning the means of getting protected , fed , and so on is normally correct . This formulation , however , reintroduces the notion of believing and in the present context it is essential to see that we do not need to introduce it . 96 / Thinking This normalcy claim is not asserted for all p because of cases like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and E that would satisfy ( NEU ) if we substitute for p " The curfew tolls the knell of parting day . " However , for a very large range of cases , ( NEU ) does hold . A few illustrations will make its point clear . ( i ) Standing in front of the meat counter , I say to the butcher " I 'd like a pound of ground chuck . " This almost always has the result that the butcher hands a pound of ground chuck over the counter . " Please pass the potatoes " , said at table , if there are indeed potatoes being served , almost always is followed by the potatoes coming around in my direction . ( ii ) I look out the window and say , " It 's raining . " This will normally produce an expectation in hearers who can not see out the window . The evidence for this claim is that if I am present when they move and can see out the window , and if they see no signs of recent rain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it rained " or something tantamount to this , in a tone of mild indignation . ( iii ) I ask someone where the courthouse is . She replies , " Three blocks west and two blocks south . " I would almost always start walking either west or south , counting blocks as I go . I would also have an expectation of encountering a courthouse if I go three blocks west and two south . ( iv ) My host says , " Martinis are best if the gin/vermouth ratio is six to one . " This will cause an expectation that this is how his martinis will be mixed . People will pointedly mention what they thought he said , if he turns out to mix his martinis four to one ; they will ask for a lower ratio if they like their martinis less dry . ( v ) A mathematician says in a lecture , " Dividing through ( a2 ? ab ) by a , we get a ? I. " This will almost always produce an objection from some member of the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job . He declares that there must be hidden variables that will yield a deterministic explanation of quantum mechanical relations . He is not hired . A temptation may arise here that is parallel to the one that arose for our non-linguistic cases . This is to amend ( NEU ) so as to say Thinking / 97 that E ensues when utterers of p believe they are in C or are believed by others to be in C. Such an amended version would be true , but not to the point . We are not here looking for necessary and sufficient conditions for occurrences of E. The point is rather that the normalcy claim ( NEU ) is true , just as it stands . Again , there may be a temptation to object that ( NEU ) is true only because people believe certain things ( that ; is , about circumstances or about other people ) and that this fact will somehow reintroduce the circularity problem . This objection , however , both changes the subject and threatens to beg the question . It changes the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it neither implies nor excludes any particular explanation of why it is true . It is not designed to lead to an argument that has a premise of the form " ( NEU ) is caused to be true by X " ( nor to one of the form " ( NEU ) is not caused to be true by X " ) . I shall instead be arguing only from the truth of ( NEU ) . The objection threatens to beg the question in so far as it may suggest that there can not be an account of why ( NEU ) is true that does not render my whole procedure circular . In response I can say only that it is part of my project to be explicit about the relation between the philosophical account of intentionality and possible views as to the causes of intentionality . I can not complete this project until Chapter IV . By the end of that chapter , however , there should not be even an appearance of the suggested circularity . It May be helpful briefly to consider a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it might be supposed that ( NEU ) is plausible only because we usually assume that other people are psychologically normal . Now , there is a response to this that I believe to be correct and that concisely summarizes the perspective I shall develop . It is that , conversely to the order suggested by the objection , we usually think people are psychologically normal because , usually , they behave normally . Moreover , what oneself or others have recently said is part of what fixes a situation as one in which certain behavior is normal . This response , of course , can not 98 / Thinking be supposed to be evidently correct at this point . I hope it will be so , however , by the end of my argument . Once these remarks about how ( NEU ) is to be taken are understood , one may wish for more than illustrations in support of it . There are two arguments that we can offer here . The first is that it is easy in very many cases to think of a C and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many p , just hearing it makes us think of a typical situation in which someone 's saying it would usually have a particular sequel . It would be hard to explain how we could have such immediate responses to many sentences unless ( NEU ) were true . The second argument is that it is hard to see how language could either be learned or be meaningful if ( NEU ) were not true . Language would not be learned if it did not do learners some good . But it can not do learners any good unless they can anticipate the results of many of their utterances . " Anticipate " , like " expect " in the present context , does not involve conscious rehearsal . Thus , I am not saying that language learners have to rehearse the consequences of their utterances before making them . Instead , I am saying that there must be whatever causes are required to account for the fact that , in general , when they bring out a certain utterance , they are not unpleasantly surprised by what ensues . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of situations in which , normally , if they say " p " a certain thing will happen . This , however , is possible only if there are features of situations in which , normally , if they say " p " a certain thing will happen ; that is to say , only if ( NEU ) is satisfied . Likewise , if there were not many p for which there were some C and E that satisfied ( NEU ) , language could not be meaningful . One has to imagine , for example , what would happen to " Please pass the potatoes " if this routinely increased the proximity of peas rather than potatoes ? or if it routinely got the potatoes thrown at one 's head . In such a case , " potatoes " or " pass " would not mean what they mean in English ; someone who wanted the potatoes passed would either Thinking / 99 have to say something else or remain frustrated . Likewise , " Three blocks west and two blocks south " would not mean what it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those who receive it as a direction . The point can be extended to all our examples and many other cases : put generally , it is that if our words did not have their usual effects and r certain circumstances , they would either mean something differ nt or they would have no meaning at all . The solution to th circularity problem requires that there be something that counts as behaving like a person who says " p " . It is time to ask how ( NEU ) will help show that there is such a thing , assuming , as I shall henceforth do , that ( NEU ) is true . We may begin with some imperatives . People may say " Let 's eat " , " Please , let me go to bed " , " I want an umbrella " , or " Shall we make love ? " In the circumstances in which these are normally said , their normal sequels are , respectively , eating , sleeping , protection against the rain , and lovemaking . These facts give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus reason to think of these kinds of behavior if we are told that someone behaves like a person who has uttered one of them . On the view I am proposing , attributing desirings is the same thing as attributing patterns of behavior under descriptions of the form " behaves like one who says ' p ' " . I have argued that there is such a thing as behaving like one who says " Let 's eat , " " Please , let me go to bed " , and so on . Thus I am now entitled to speak of desirings that are characterized by " Let 's eat " , " Please , let me go to bed " , and so on , or in more colloquial language , of cases of people desiring to eat , to go to bed , and so on . ' , There is , of course , no need in most contexts to spell out the normalcies that are exhibited in our daily life . I shall in fact now generally speak in the language of desiring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was only necessary to proceed so slowly in the context of the circularity problem . In particular , it was ioo / Thinking necessary to show that we could explain the reason for associating a certain kind of behavior with a certain sentence in terms of normalcies and without reference to prior assignments of thinkings . Our task now is to extend the idea developed in the last three paragraphs to a wider class of cases . We may consider an imperative that is associated with a less general interest than the ones just reviewed . For example , people who say " Please pass the potatoes " at table usually eat some of the potatoes that shortly arrive . While the potatoes are being passed they do not normally rise from their places , fold their napkins or pat their stomachs and say " I 'm stuffed . " So there is something that people would reasonably expect if they were told that you would behave like a person who says " Please pass the potatoes " or , what comes to the same by ( TTA ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I turn now to some declarative utterances . People who say " Candidate X is the best one " around election time usually vote for candidate X if they vote at all . Politicians who say things like " Bill #191 provides more benefits at less cost than any alternative proposal that is likely to pass " and say it close to the time at which the vote on the bill is to be taken usually vote for Bill #191 . So there is a reason that can be described by reference to normalcies and without reference to other thinkings for associating yea-voting with people who say the things just quoted . There is thus a non-circular reason for identifying something as behaving like a person who says such things . By ( TTA ) we are non-circularly justified in speaking of believings characterized by the above sentences or , more colloquially , of cases of believing that candidate X is the best one or that Bill #19I has certain features . These examples suggest a complication that we must discuss . Notoriously , politicians break their promises or change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bill #191 now may very well vote against it in a few months . This might get one to thinking that , after all , there is no behavior that is associated with speaking in I , Thinking / ioi behalf of Bill #191 . There are , however , two things that can be said about this . First , the very fact that we speak of broken promises or changes of mind shows that we do in fact associate a certain kind of behavior with sentences of the kind I used as an example . This is possible because , as is built into ( NEU ) , we take account of circumstances in which things are said and not only the utterances themselves . Second , there re some concomitants of speaking as I have imagined that are noimal no matter what the circumstances . Thus , people who speak of the benefits of a bill hardly ever villify others who speak on its behalf ; they do not oppose other measures that serve ends similar to the bill they favor without being a rival to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they support would serve . These facts are , of course , special cases of the truism that people generally act coherently , that is , they do not normally act in such a way that one thing they do prevents the normal effect of something else they do from serving their desires . I have been arguing that , for many p , there is such a thing as behaving like a person who says " p " . It will be useful for further development to give this result a more formal expression . We can state the point as a Relation between Behavior and Utterance : ( RBU ) For many p , there is at least one circumstance C such that ( i ) C can be specified without reference to utterers ' thinkings , and ( ii ) There is some behavior B such that normally , when people say " p " in C , they exhibit B. There are some believings for which a wider condition ( ii ) would hold . An example would be " z + 2 = 4 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) by choosing for C a case where an adding of z and z is about to take place . Then B would be the writing or speaking of " 4 " . But it is also true that teachers who say " 2. + z = 4 " can be counted on to add correctly if a case of adding z 1oz / Thinking and z comes up in the future . This suggests an alternative to ( ii ) , as follows : ( ii ' ) There is some behavior B such that normally , if people say " p , " then they exhibit B upon the subsequent occurrence of C. Let us give the name " ( RBU ' ) " to a statement just like ( RBU ) except that it has ( ii ' ) instead of ( ii ) . It is obvious that ( RBU ' ) holds for many p , although , as the example of the politicians ' behavior shows , it holds for fewer p than does ( RBU ) . Since ( RBU ) and ( RBU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We may call the result " ( RBU , ) " . ( RBU1 ) has been introduced as part of our argument that there is such a thing as behaving like a person who says " p " . In order to go on and complete our argument and our explanation of what behaving like a person who says " p " comes to , we need to look at ( RBU1 ) from another point of view . We need to notice that ( RBU1 ) can be used to describe the kind of evidence that is relevant to establishing that people have a thinking characterizable by p . That is , we can read ( RBU1 ) as telling us that when people exhibit behavior B in circumstance C , they are acting like people who say " p " . So , if we observe people exhibiting B and C , we have reason to characterize them as behaving like those who say " p " . That is , by ( TTA ) , we have reason to attribute to them a thinking characterized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of the kind just described will be sufficient to provide us with as much certainty as we can ever have about contingent facts . Since we will need to refer to the ps that characterize thinkings for which such evidence is sufficient , I shall introduce a short phrase to denote them . I shall call them " p that can be established by ( RBU1 ) " . While some p can be established by ( RBU1 ) alone , there are some p for which something more is involved than what is captured in ( RBU1 ) . We can bring this out by noting that for many p , there is more to behaving like a person who says " p " than doing what is normal for everyone in some circumstance . Sometimes one also has Thinking / 103 to do what normal people would do if they not only said " p " but also had certain other thinkings characterized by , say , q or r . For example , Jones is not behaving like someone who says " Smith has arrived " unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am supposing that she finds Smith obnoxious . People who find Smith obnoxious would normally take steps to avoid him when they believe he has arrived ; but , of course , this does not hold of all normal people without further specification . This point may seem to reintroduce the circularity problem ; but I shall now explain how we can accommodate it withoult falling afoul of this problem . Intuitively , the strategy of the formulations I shall give is to use thinkings that can be established by ( RBU1 ) to help establish further thinkings ; then to use these to establish still further ones ; and so on . The conception I am working toward is that we can begin with basic needs in order to establish some desires ; that we can use these to establish some beliefs about the immediate situation ; that we can use these in turn to establish further desires and beliefs ; and that we can gradually spiral outward toward the establishing of a person 's whole belief/desire hierarchy . We can give this strategy formal expression by modifying ( i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( RBU2 ) For many p , there is at least one C such that ( i ' ) C can be specified in a way that refers to no thinkings Tx of utterers of p except those such that ( a ) Tx is characterized by px and ( b ) px is a p that can be established by ( RBU1 ) ; and ( ii " ) Either there is some behavior B such that normally when people say " p " in C they exhibit B or there is some behavior B such that normally when people say " p " then if C occurs , they exhibit B.11 104 / Thinking Once again , while ( RBU2 ) has been introduced to articulate the concept of behaving like a person who says " p " , we can regard it as a description of how we can establish that people are behaving in this way and thus , by ( TTA ) , as a description of how we can establish that people have certain thinkings . I shall refer to the p that characterize such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RBU2 ) " . We can now formulate ( RBU3 ) , which is just like ( RBU2 ) except that clause ( b ) of condition ( i ' ) reads ( b ) px is a p that can be established by ( RBU1 ) or ( RBU2 ) . Generalizing this idea , we can formulate a series of statements in which each ( RBU ? ) has a clause ( b ) of condition ( i ' ) that reads ( b ) px is a p that can be established by ( RBU1 ) or . . . or ( RBUi1 ) . This enables us to formulate a Solution to the Circularity Problem . ( SCP ) Every thinking for whose attribution we have good reason is characterized by a p such that , for some n , p can be established by ( RBUn ) . I have argued for the truth of ( RBUZ ) . A direct argument for ( SCP ) , however , would require us to take an arbitrary attribution that we regard as well founded and work out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the course of establishing it . One case of this might require a whole book . So ( SCP ) must remain an hypothesis . It has the following properties . It does not appeal to anything non-physical . It solves the circularity problem . It begins with something that can be convincingly argued for ( that is , ( RBU1 ) ) . It enables us to make theoretical sense of the obvious fact that we use assumptions about some of people 's thinkings in order to establish further attributions of thinkings to them . Finally , when we see some of the difficulties of alternative views , I believe ( SCP ) will emerge as by far Thinking / 105 the most reasonable view to take about our attributions of thinkings . Some Consequences Before considering alternatives , I want to return to the notion of pretending that someone has said " p " and exhibit its fruitfulness . This will enable me to complete my account of intentionality and to respond to some natural questions . There are three topics that I will take up . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I described two ways of introducing the concept of intentionality . The second of these depends on the fact that certain inferences fail , even though they involve the mere substitution of names or phrases that denote the same things as the words they replace . On my account we can understand the peculiarity of these inferences as derivative upon intentionality in the sense of its first , more fundamental introduction . In general , knowledge that N1 is identical with N2 ( or that the G is identical with the H ) is independent of knowledge that NI is F ( or that the G is F ) or that N2 is F ( or that the H is F ) . Thus people who say " N1 is F " ( or " The G is F " ) may or may not behave like people who say " N2 is F " ( or " The H is F " ) . Therefore , pretending that people have said one of these things will in general be different from pretending that they have said the others . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking characterized by one of the above sentences is different from attributing to them a thinking characterized by one of the others . These remarks may draw the objection that they are too strong , because they fail to recognize that some attributions of thinkings do not exhibit the inferential peculiarity noted above.12 I have in mind here de re beliefs and desires . However , we can easily add an account of these . For simplicity I shall state this account only for de re zo6 / Thinking beliefs ; the account for de re desires will be an obvious parallel . To begin with , it will be helpful to have a standard form for attributions of both de re and de dicto beliefs . For the first , I shall use the schema ( DRB ) P asserts that S believes , with respect to a , that it is F ( where a is a referring expression ) . For the second , I shall use the schema ( DDB ) P asserts that S believes that a is F ( where , again , a is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can lay aside ( or settle ) any questions about the sincerity of P. Then , if we know an instance of ( DDB ) we have some reason to pretend that S has said " a is F. " We can think of P as inviting us to adopt this pretence . However , if we know an instance of ( DRB ) we know less about what we should pretend about S. We can take P to be inviting us to pretend that S has said something of the form " x is F " , but we do n't know what we should put in the place of " x " . On the other hand , in knowing an instance of ( DRB ) we get to know more about P. We are entitled to pretend that P has said something of the form " a is . . . " without knowing how we should fill in the dots . In knowing an instance of ( DDB ) , of course , we do not have any guide to what we should pretend with respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de re belief-attributions " put us in the picture " with respect to both attributor and attributee ? at the cost of telling us less about the attributee . De dicto attributions tell us more about the attributee , but nothing about the attributor.13 ( ii ) I have been arguing that the meaning of utterances depends on their normal effects and that , in consequence , normal people speak as they do in part because they anticipate the effects of their utter- Thinking / 107 ances . In turn , when we hear people speak , or hear reports of what they say , we have responses and expectations that are appropriate to people who are expecting such effects and who are unlikely to do things that might interfere with those effects . Conditions are , however , not always normal . It is worth commenting on a few cases in which something unusual is afoot . The comments to come will provide a background for the statement of , and also the resolution of , a problem that some will want to raise against a physicalistic account of intentionality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special ase of this can be described as follows . Suppose a thinking char cterizable by p would be normal for people in S 's position to have , but that S in fact thinks not-p . On being told , quite correctly , that S also thinks in a way characterizable by q , we may come to expect a certain behavior from S that will not actually be forthcoming . Our error can be corrected ( or prevented ) by learning more about S , that is , by learning about S 's unusual thinking . The case just described is one in which the responses mobilized by an attribution of a thinking are inappropriate . In another kind of case , they may be merely not forthcoming . Most people would , for example , have very little response upon hearing that Jones believes that there are universals . There is hardly anything that would strike themaas surprising in view of what they 've heard ( or hardly anything whose occurrence or non-occurrence becomes surprising because they have heard this attribution ) . Similar remarks would hold for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As before , increased response , increased understanding , and increased usefulness of having heard attributions all come with increased knowledge . In the cases at hand , making use of an attribution requires learning the jargon in which the sentence characterizing it is expressed . One must , for example , develop some habits of response to utterances involving the term " universal " . If one is to understand correctly , these habits of response must parallel those io8 / Thinking possessed by members of the linguistic subcommunity in which such utterances are common . It is only when one has such habits that they can be mobilized in pretending that people have said something about universals . The same point can be extended to the case of utterances made by speakers of a language we do not understand . Such utterances will have no effect on us , except in so far as they are noises or expenditures of energy on the part of the speaker . In order to make any further use of them , we can do one of two things . First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may come to have the same normal responses to utterances in it that are had by its native speakers . If we do this , we will also be able to understand attributions of thinkings to people , where the sentences characterizing the thinkings are sentences of the new language . The alternative procedure is to rely on a translation of utterances of the new language into our familiar one . In this case we pretend that the speaker of the new language has said something in our language . We allow our normal expectations and responses to be mobilized in reference to the speaker . If our expectations are correct and our responses are successful , we will count the translation as a good one.14 This scheme of things is simple enough as long as the new language and our familiar one are in perfect correspondence . That is , matters are simple so long as there are normal responses by native speakers of the new language that match our normal responses to our translations of their utterances . But what if the correspondence breaks down ? What if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deviant in our community ? This might have the consequences that no utterance in our language would have the same normal consequences as any utterance in the new language , and vice versa . In this case , pretending that a speaker had said " p " , where p is a sentence of our language , would always lead us to mistaken expectations . Thinking / 109 Fortunately , we are versatile beings who can pretend a number of things at the same time . ( This is a consequence of the fact that we can adjust our actual behavior to any number of features of a situation ? which is just a way of saying we are intelligent . ) We can pretend that people say " p " while , at the same time , pretending that they say " q " . We can pretend both of these while also pretending that they respond to our utterances as we do except in some certain respect ? much as we can pretend to be a person in a hurry , but also pretend to be a person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more we know about the people whom we are trying to understand through translation , the closer our pretendings can get to being appropriate in every respect to the behavior they will exhibit . The full development in this direction makes us able to respond to an utterance either as our real selves or as people who are normal members of another community . With this ability goes the ability to anticipate 's others ' responses to one 's utterances . These abilities make possible criticism of the kind I will call " insightful " . Insightful criticism is criticism of the kind that could be immediately understood , and appreciated as criticism , by the people being criticized . It is to be contrasted with superficial criticism , which merely rejects the unfamiliar because it is not like what is familiar.16 Insightful criticism is possible because we can learn to respond like a member of another community ; we can come to appreciate what would be considered a problem by normal members of a new community , what would be considered to be a response to it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are now in a position where we can state and discuss an objection to our whole account . This objection asserts that in order to understand people in another community we must understand what rs . Recall that anticipating is not rehearsal or conscious articulation of predictions , but only becoming disposed to be surprised by possible future occurrences and the ability to adjust one 's behavior to be successful in normal cases . See above , p. 98. 16 . Or , less commonly , accepts something because it accords with something already found desirable . izo / Thinking their cultural form demands of them . For example , to understand something said by a feudal lord , it would be necessary to understand feudalism . To understand something said by a Hindu , it would be necessary to understand that religion and to know what its internal structure imposes upon those who subscribe to it . The objection further asserts that such cultural forms transcend the behavior of individuals and can not be reduced in any other way to the purely physical . If this is so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is perhaps not mental , is certainly not physical . ' 7 In response to this objection , I agree that there is a sense in which cultural forms are independent of the behavior of the individuals composing a community . I deny , however , that this kind of independence requires an ontological commitment to anything non-physical . The key point in making out this position is the claim that the independence of cultural forms is nothing other than the fact that ( insightful ) criticism in a community is never finished . The members of a community can never be in a position to know that no further objection , question , or problem can arise for their beliefs and habits of action . When we pretend to be members of a community , we are no better off in principle than its actual members . We can never reasonably suppose that we have thought of all the challenges to a way of living that could be raised from within the community itself . However , we can raise challenges that were not actually raised by members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can successfully pretend to give responses of its members to problems we have pretended to have been raised . If we can agree on what a well-considered response by typical members of a community would have been , we can legitimately treat the response as " built into " the cultural form of that community , even if it was never called forth in the actual history of its members . In drawing such a conclu- Thinking / i r i sion we are , in effect , using the same abilities as were possessed by members of the community under consideration ? abilities that we have been able to acquire by thorough study of their actual behavior . It is in the nature of abilities to have potential for being exercised on occasions other than those on which they are actually used . It is this fact , not any non-physical thing , that explains the independence of cultural forms . ( iii ) Intentionality is often attributed to animals and occasionally to simple devices such as thermostats . Such attributions strike some people as compelling , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some ideas already introduced will enable us to make sense of these conflicting intuitions . The problem presented by animals is that it seems natural to attribute thinkings to them ; the only way we have of characterizing those thinkings is by sentences of our language ; but we do not at all wish to imply that animals understand our language . The solution to this problem lies in the fact that we can adjust our pretendings to several features of our situation at the same time . Thus , we can pretend that our dog has said " I want to go out " or " There are Dog Crunchies in that cupboard . " That is , we can suppose that it will behave like a person who says those things while taking account of the fact that we are pretending this of a dog . Our expectations will be adjusted accordingly and our responses will be appropriate to the fact that Fido is a dog as well as to the fact that it wants to go out . People who want to go out get up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do not ordinarily offer them assistance . If they are children or paralyzed we do offer assistance . We factor these features into , our behavior . I am proposing that this is also the way in which we can make sense of attributions of thinkings to animals . We can run the same idea with respect to a thermostat . We can pretend that it has just said " It 's cold in here " or we can pretend that it will behave like a person who has just said " It 's cold in here " ? bearing in mind that it is a thermostat about which we are pretend-i 114 / Thinking tionality . " Urk malng pfizit " is not about anything , whether I say it out loud or whether I have it in auditory imagery . But for all I know , the same imagery had by a Martian would be a rehearsal of a very improper invitation . The circumstances required for this to be the case are just that these sounds would be an improper invitation if the Martian said them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely doubtful that inner speech is a cause of audible speech or of actions . For I am claiming that inner speech has its intentionality derivatively . It could thus never have had any point ? could not have been inwardly saying anything ? unless there had already been audible speech and normal responses to audible utterances . At some time , therefore , these latter must have had causes other than inner speech . It is extremely implausible to suppose that somehow these causes have been replaced in their function by inner speech . There is , moreover , obvious evidence against such an hypothesis . When we converse , we do not have inner speech rehearsals of what we say . Nor do we need inner speech rehearsals of our actions , any more than we need to say out loud what we are going to do before we do it . Further , when we do have inner speech rehearsals of what we are about to say our actual utterances are usually improvements upon , rather than exact repetitions of , our inner speech . Finally , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that inner speech is an effect of causes that are largely the same as those that produce overt speech . For these reasons , we should resist identifications , like that made by Jerry Fodor , of mental causes and " what is running through one 's head " . ' 8 At the beginning of my account of intentionality I claimed that while I would have to mention something non-physical , the contri18 . See Jerry Fodor , " Methodological Solipsism Considered as a Research Strategy in Cognitive Psychology " , reprinted in his Representations ( Cambridge , Mass. : MIT Press , 1981 ) , pp. 2z5-253 . For the illicit identification see esp . pp. 235-236 , 237 , and 246 . Thinking / 115 bution that this makes would be clearly parasitic on a grounding of intentionality that did not appeal to anything non-physical . In arguing that the intentionality of inner speech is derivative upon the intentionality of audible speech I have supported and explained this claim . CHAPTER IV Acts and Thoughts I have tried to make the foregoing account of intentionality as simple as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it has a certain amount of complexity . Some alternative views of intentionality have the advantage of being much simpler . This can become a powerful reason for being attracted to them . It is thus necessary to present the most important of these views and to show that the price they pay for simplicity is too high . The alternatives that we must consider share something besides ( relative ) simplicity . They are ways of expanding on the idea that words are meaningful because they express our thoughts . This is also a powerful attraction of these views , and we must show why it does not really give us a reason for preferring them . The process of getting out from under the idea that words are meaningful because they express thoughts will enable us to see more clearly what the view of the preceding chapter amounts to and will allow us to have afirmer grasp of how our conception of ourselves as thinkers can be related to our conception of ourselves as dependent on neural activity . Intrinsic Intentionality and Acts In order to understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between intrinsic and extrinsic intentionality . I 117 118 / Acts and Thoughts shall say that an item that has intentionality has it extrinsically just in case its having intentionality ( or , its having its particular intentionality , for example , meaning or standing for whatever exactly it does mean or stand for ) depends on its standing in relation to some other things . I shall say that an item has its intentionality intrinsically if its having intentionality ( or its particular intentionality ) does not depend on its standing in relation to other things . The view I have presented in Chapter III recognizes nothing that has its intentionality intrinsically . The alternative I now want to discuss diverges from that view precisely by holding that some items do have their intentionality intrinsically . It holds , further , that the items that have intrinsic intentionality are thoughts , in exactly my regimented sense of an " inner episode " . Interestingly enough , we may take this as our entire specification of the view to be considered . Even though there are a number of further questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how we answer them : the criticisms I will make will apply whatever answer we give . We should , however , mention one or two of the possible sub-alternatives . Thus , we can ask whether or not thoughts are " inner " in the literal sense of inside the head . An affirmative answer here has not often been advanced , because this would commit one to something straightforwardly physical with intrinsic intentionality . ) The usual answer has been 1 . John Searle appears to embrace intrinsically intentional physical things in his Intentionality ( Cambridge : Cambridge University Press , 1983 ) . Such a view is suggested by putting the following quotations together . " In my view it is not possible to give a logical analysis of the Intentionality of the mental in terms of simpler notions , since Intentionality is , so to speak , a ground floor property of the mind , not a logically complex feature built up by combining simpler elements " ( z6 ) . " If the question is " What is the mode of existence of beliefs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about how the world works the answer is : Intentional states are both caused by and realized in the structure of the brain " ( 15 ) . However , Searle also says , " An Intentional state only determines its conditions of satisfaction ? and thus only is the state that it is ? given its position in a Network of other Intentional states and against a Background of practices and preintentional assumptions that are neither themselves Intentional states nor are they pacts of the Acts and Thoughts / z 19 the negative one , that is , the view that thoughts are non-physical , mental episodes having intrinsic intentionality , which are " inner " only in the metaphorical sense of somehow " standing behind " our behavior . The traditional name for items conceived in this way is " ( mental ) act " and I shall use this term in the remainder of this section.2 One may now ask whether or not the intrinsic intentionality of an act can be analyzed into two facts , namely , ( a ) the fact that an act is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the property has intrinsic intentionality . I shall adopt the simpler mode of speaking ; that is , I shall say that acts are what have intentionality . Everything I will say , however , can be trivially reformulated to apply to the view that holds that , strictly speaking , it is properties of acts that have intentionality.3 I shall not attempt to argue that there are no acts . I shall , however , argue that we do not need them . The reason people believe they are needed is that without them , it seems , words would not be expressing our thoughts . But if words did not express our thoughts , they would be meaningless noises . They could not have intentionality . We can make the same point starting from the other end . There is nothing about noises or series of letters by themselves that bestows a conditions of satisfaction of Intentional states " ( 19 ) . This and/the ensuing discussion seen , to imply that the intentionality of brain structures 1pgically depends on their standing in certain relations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their intentionality is not intrinsic in the sense in which I am using the term . I have been unable to satisfy myself that there is any clear resolution of these opposing tendencies in Searle 's work ; hence I find the classification of his view problematic . z . " Mental act " in philosophy of mind has no special connection with will , although deciding is a species of act . ( Other species include believing , desiring , fearing , wondering , and many more . ) " Mental act " does not derive from " mental action " or " mental activity " . Instead it means " mental actuality " , that is , " actually existing mental state or event " . 3 . For an exposition of an act view , see Gustav Bergmann , " Acts " , in his Logic and Reality ( Madison : University of Wisconsin Press , 1964 ) . See also Roderick Chisholm 's correspondence with Wilfrid Sellars in Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science , vol. 2 ( 1958 ) , pp. 521-539. z zo / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , translation would be impossible ( how could those other sounds mean the same thing as ours ? ) and perhaps unnecessary ( because there would be only one thing the foreigner 's sounds could mean ) . These consequences are , of course , absurd . But then , words must be given a meaning . It can seem obvious that we give them a meaning by using them to express our thoughts . This , however , requires that there be thoughts that already have their intentionality . Plausible as this may be , it is incoherent . We can not make sense of the idea that an intrinsically intentional act contributes anything to the intentionality of language . To bring this out we must ask the question whether sincere statements that involve no verbal slip could mis-express what their utterers ' mental acts are about . Suppose , first , that this is logically impossible . This supposition destroys the intrinsic intentionality of acts , because according to it they could not mean what they mean unless they were related to certain behaviors on the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . If people say " The cat is on the mat " when they are intending to say what 's on their minds , then ( on this first supposition ) they must be having an act that is about the cat being on the mat . The converse is that if they are having that act , then it is logically necessary that if they intend to say what 's on their minds , and they actually speak and do not suffer a slip of the tongue , then they say " The cat is on the mat " or at least something synonymous with this . ) This , however , makes the intentionality of acts dependent on their relation to behavior ; and this is incompatible with their having their intentionality intrinsically . So let us move to the alternative supposition , that it is logically possible for a sincere utterance without a verbal slip to mis-express what an act is about . This supposition cuts against the idea that my utterances derive their intentionality from my acts . For a mis-expression has to be directed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then , its being directed upon whatever it is directed upon can not Acts and Thoughts / Ili be supposed to derive from the act that accompanies it . Therefore , the meaning of the utterance gets its direction from something other than the accompanying act . One response that might be made to this argument is to say that utterances that do not express accompanying acts can not really express anything different , that they must really be nonsense and at best appear to express something different . This is unintelligible , however , since there is no sense to the claim that somebody 's utterance of " The cat is on the mat " ( for example ) is really nonsense and only appears to mean something . A stronger response would be to hold that it is logically necessary that our words usually express our acts . However , if it is not necessary for each sincere , non-verballyslipped utterance to correspond to its utterer 's act , we can ask for an explanation of this general necessity . There is no plausible idea that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not function unless people normally said what they thought . However , this idea can not support an act view , because it can be accounted for by alternatives . It is , in fact , incorporated in the view of Chapter III . ( If this is not already obvious , it will become so very shortly . ) Thus we are entitled to the conclusion I anticipated above , that is , that a view that embraces intrinsically intentional acts can not be something that we need in order to account for the meaningfulness of our words . If we are to overcome completely the attraction of the view we have been discussing , we must give an alternative account of the consideration that makes it plausible . The grain of truth behind the temptation to say that our words must express our acts is that it is necessary for meaningful words generally to express our think ings . We can make this out as follows . Sounds would be meaningless unless they were located in surroundings in which their utterance had normal effects on hearers . They could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the circumstance that these effects are the normal ones . In particular , they could not be understood if people who uttered them 1 22 / Acts and Thoughts did not normally anticipate the likely results of their utterances and did not adjust their utterances to those anticipated results . However , if people do anticipate and adjust in this way , with respect to some utterance p , then there will be something that counts as behaving like a person who says " p " . Thus ( cf. ( TTA ) ) there will be the grounds required for attributing a thinking characterizable by p . Conversely , where there are thinkings characterizable by p , there must be such a thing as behaving like a person who says fp " and hence utterances of p must have normal effects on hearers . The connection between thinkings and words can be summed up in this way : Necessarily , words generally express our thinkings because the conditions required for there being thinkings are the same as those required for there being meaningful words . A sentence etched into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not because there would be no act for it to express , but because the conditions for its being an expression of some person 's thinking would be lacking . There is one more way in which intrinsically intentional acts may be introduced . It may be held that , whether or not we need them in order to explain anything , we have non-inferential and incorrigible knowledge of our acts or , in short , that we are acquainted with them . I can not prove that the concept of an act with which we are acquainted is self-contradictory and I can not add anything to what I have already said to cast doubt on the coherence of the very idea of a mental act " behind " our words . But I can try to explain why some people might falsely believe they are acquainted with acts . There are three possible confusions about which I shall comment . ( i ) We can easily produce statements of the form " I believe that p " or " I desire that q be the case . " Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are true . These statements have more words than do p or q by themselves . So it may seem that they must refer to something besides what is referred to by p or q . Acts with which we are acquainted would answer to the description of , something further , which the longer statements could be about and which would account for the fact that we can know those longer statements to be Acts and Thoughts / 123 true . What we must notice , however , is that the actual force of " I believe that p " and " I desire that q be the case " is only an intensification of " p " and " Let q be the case " , respectively . Utterances of the former do not tell hearers any more about my thinkings than do utterances of the latter . We do not need to know or be acquainted with anything further in order to know the former than we do to know the latter . The fact that we can know that " I believe that p " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires no more than what is already required by the fact that I can utter " p " and then go on to behave like someone who says " p " . Normally , if language is to have meaning , those who say " p " must behave like people who say " p " ; that is , there must be something that counts as behaving like one who says " p " . So , normally , people who say " p " in an intensified manner will behave like people who say " p " ; that is , their self-ascriptions of thinkings will normally match their future behavior. ( ii ) There is an experience that is naturally described as " fishing for words " to express what one wants to say . When one finds them it can seem as if one has finally found the words that match what has been " before one 's mind " all along . It is tempting to represent a case of this kind as one in which one is acquainted with one 's act and knows what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is searching for , the right words . However , this way of representing the situation says more than we are entitled to say . The fact that something seems correct does not show that it matches something that was already there . It can perfectly well be the case that some attempts to articulate one 's thinkings have results that lead us/ reject them as incorrect and that the " correct " expression is werely the one that no longer strikes us as having unwanted consequences . ( iii ) We are acquainted with our inner speech . This gives us a way in which we can tell ourselves what we think . Through this , we can come to have a sense that what we think is immediately present to us . This , I suggest , may be one fact that leads to the plausibility of intrinsically intentional acts . We have , however , already seen that 124 / Acts and Thoughts inner speech has its intentionality derivatively ; that is , it is about whatever the words composing it are about . Thus , it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech , therefore , can not be acquaintance with intrinsically intentional mental acts . Extrinsically Intentional Thoughts The views I will now discuss differ from the account of Chapter III by holding that the analysis of intentionality requires internal episodes having intentionality . They differ from the view of the preceding section by holding that the required internal episodes do not have their intentionality intrinsically . These internal episodes are thus not acts and I shall refer to them by the term I have already regimented for the purpose , that is , " thoughts " . There is a further , subsidiary difference . Since the thoughts we are now considering have their intentionality extrinsically , there is no longer any motive for supposing they are non-physical . In conformity to actually held views , I shall assume in what follows that thoughts are to be identified with brain states . If thoughts are said to have their intentionality extrinsically , we can ask what relations are involved and what things thoughts must be related to in order to be intentional . The interesting answers to this question are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their intentionality from certain features of their causes . The alternative , Consequentialist View is ( CV ) Thoughts derive their intentionality from certain features of their effects . I shall discuss these alternatives in the following two sections . Acts and Thoughts / 125 Etiology The etiological view has been articulated and persuasively argued for by Fred Dretske . His is clearly the strongest version of the view and I shall henceforth identify ( EV ) with Dretske 's way of developing it . Since I will be quoting some of Dretske 's arguments in a critical context it seems only fair to expound the view in his own words . A system has concepts insofar as its internal states constitute an alignment , some degree of coordination , between input and output . But the fact that there exists this kind of coordination between input and output does not determine what concepts a system has . What concepts a system has depends on what kind of information it is to which the coordination has been made ( 214 ) .4 . . . A concept is a two faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other face looks ahead to effects and consequences . No structure qualifies as a concept unless it has both the backward-looking , informational aspect and the forward-looking , functional aspect , but what gives the structure its conceptual identity , what makes it this concept rather than that concept , is its etiological specificity ( 214 ? 215 ) . ... What I have argued is that our internal states acquire their meaning in terms of the information to which their original formation into functional units was a response . It is the information embodied in these original , formative stimuli that supplies the content to those internal structures ( 231 ) . Before turning to Dretske 's arguments for this view two preliminary remarks are in order . ( i ) In the portion of Dretske 's work that we are about to consider it is taken for granted that there are thoughts and 4 . Parenthetical numbers in this subsection refer to pages of Fred Dretske , Knowledge and the Flow of Information ( Cambridge , Mass. : MIT Press , 1981 ) . 1 26 / Acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their particular intentionality . My account of intentionality does not require the introduction of thoughts , so I regard their use as contentious . It would , however , be tedious to repeat this , so I will pretend to go along with thoughts while considering the etiological view . My strategy in the long run is to show that thoughts can not help us account for intentionality by showing that first , ( EV ) is false and second , ( CV ) prevents thoughts from making any contribution to the analysis of intentionality. ( ii ) ( CV ) is a claim about thoughts , but many things that can be said about it could be applied to my view that the intentionality of utterances depends on their normal consequences . Dretske sometimes states his case against ( CV ) in broad terms : he thinks that not only can thoughts not acquire their intentionality from their effects , but that nothing can . It should be clear from each context what items are being denied to acquire their intentionality from their effects . My discussion of ( EV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall present an argument against it . Second , I shall consider Dretske 's positive arguments in favor of his view . Lastly , I shall turn to arguments that seek to support Dretske 's position by refuting the consequentialist alternative . Suppose my body were so arranged that I had a small , brief spasm in a muscle in my left forearm whenever a red thing came into my visual field . This is not impossible . There are , after all , retinal states produced by red things . There is something that is common to the effects of such states , even if it is only our ability to report what has come into our visual field by using the same word , " red " . It is logically possible that , in some human perceiver , whatever allows us to apply the same word to red things got accidentally connected to a neuron leading to a left forearm muscle . Of course , learning to apply " red " in the normal course of things involves learning some language . But the kind of connection we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improbaActs and Thoughts / 127 ble series of accidents.5 So let us suppose that the tic in my forearm has arisen in such a way . Further , let us imagine that I have not been trained to make use of this tic as a sign of red things . Let us suppose , finally , that I do not understand the word " red " or any synonym and that I can not successfully respond to requests to bring red things , shoot red things , and so on . We must add certain specifications to this case in order to match some technical requirements laid down by Dretske . We can do this in a way that is compatible with what we have imagined so far . Thus , consider the brain event S , which causes the firing of the neuron that in turn causes my muscle to have a spasm . S carries the information that the object before me is red.6 Further , it may be assumed to carry this information in completely digitalized form. ? 5 . To deny this is to commit oneself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentionality logically could not be met unless the effects required by the consequentialist account are generated . This prima facie unattractive position muddies the waters and leaves us with only the arguments to be discussed below as relevant considerations . 6 . It does so ex hypothesi . " Information " is a technical term , which Dretske explains at length . Not every detail is relevant here and I will not digress by attempting to summarize Dretske 's discussion . The main point is that conditions can be such that I would not be having S unless something red had just entered my visual field . Skeptical problems that might be raised against this possibility are the same as those that might be raised against the possibility of ever knowing that a red thing has come before me . Dretske says a number of things in reply to such skepticism ; I shall assume for the sake of the argument that he is successful . 7 . " We redefine a structure 's semantic content as that piece of information it carries in ( what I shall call ) completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t is F as its semantic content = ( a ) S carries the information that t is F and ( b ) S carries no other piece of information , r is d , which is such that the information that t is F is nested ( nomically or analytically ) in is being G " ( 184-185 ) . 1z8 / Acts and Thoughts That is , S may be produced in somewhat different ways depending on the object 's shape or shade of red or intensity . If this is the case , S will carry no information about those other matters , nor about other neural states that may have produced it in a particular case . Thus it is possible that matters are arranged so that the only piece of information carried by S is that the object recently entering my visual field is red . Further , S has " executive function " ; that is , it has a consequence in my behavior . Finally , it has this function in such a way that the " content " of S determines its effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forearm muscle spasm in virtue of its having the very properties by which it carries the information that the object that has recently moved into my visual field is reds My objection to the etiological view can now be stated . The features I have just enumerated are all that Dretske requires for saying that S is the belief , about a recently encountered object , that it is red.9 But in the case I have described it is not reasonable to credit the possessor of S with having the concept of red or , a fortiori , with having a belief that something is red . Other people could use the occurrence of the tic as a guide to the presence of red things ( once they had discovered the correlation ) ; but the person who has it can not ( as we have set up the case ) make any use of it or do any of the things that are expected of people who have the concept of red or beliefs about red things . If this conclusion is correct , there must be something wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two such arguments that 8 . " When I speak of a semantic structure determining output , I mean that the information . . . constituting the semantic content of that structure is a causal determinant of output . I have already . . . explained what is meant by the information in a structure or signal causing something to happen : viz. , information ( in signal or structure S ) causes E insofar as the properties of S that carry this information are those the possession of which ( by S ) makes it the cause of E " ( 198 ) . 9 . " To qualify as a cognitive structure , therefore , an internal state must not only have a semantic content , it must be this content that defines the structure 's causal influence on output " ( 199 ) . Acts and Thoughts / 12.9 seem to go directly in favor of his view ( as opposed to supporting it indirectly , by attempting to rule out alternatives ) . I shall now state and examine them . Dretske 's first argument for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shown robins and bluejays and is encouraged to say " robin " when a robin is present and " not robin " when a bluejay is present ( 195-196 ) . After she has learned to do this successfully a sparrow appears . The child points to it and says " Robin . " As Dretske points out , however , it is not immediately clear what the child believes . Dretske holds that the belief depends on the semantic content of internal structures that the child developed during training . " If it was this piece of information that is , x is a robin to which she became selectively sensitive during the training period . . . then the belief she is expressing when she points at the sparrow and says " robin " is a false belief . . . . If , on the other hand , the child was ( during training ) merely responding to the color of the birds , calling those " robin " that were not blue , then the child 's belief when it says " robin " while pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The conclusion that Dretske draws from these observations is that " what concept we credit the subject with is a function of what information we believe was instrumental in the formation of the relevant internal structure ( what semantic structure was actually developed ) " ( 195 ) . Let us flesh this argument out a little . We may begin by giving a name to the relevant internal structure ; let us call it " S " . S is the state that has the right " forward-looking , functional aspect " ; that is , it causally contributes to the child 's saying " robin " on the occasion being discussed and contributes to similar bird-related behavior on other occasions . Dretske holds that these causal contributions of S do not determine which concept we ought to assign to it as its meaning or content . What can we add that will determine this ? Dretske holds that S becomes established as a regular response in a child because the child 's utterances of " robin " are rewarded when , and only when , they follow closely upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Thoughts One possible case is that , in the child 's training , S was produced only by stimuli that carried the information that a robin was present . A second possibility is that , in the training period , S was produced only by stimuli that carried the information that a non-blue bird was present . This is a difference that can correspond to the difference in concept possession that we have already seen to be possible . It is the information carried by the stimuli received during the period when S is becoming an established response that Dretske believes to determine both the conceptual content of S and the belief that S 's possessor ( the child ) has . It would be natural to expect me to give an exposition of Dretske 's concept of information at this point . However , it turns out that we do not need to go into the details of that concept in order to see what is wrong with the argument . Instead , let us bring out its structure a little more clearly by further abbreviation . One key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have either of ( at least ) two beliefs . It does not matter so much which ones they are , so let us just call them " A " and " B " . Similarly , the crucial fact about the informational difference in the stimuli is that there is a difference . We can mark this by referring to the information I1 and I2 . Finally , let us use " S is connected with I ? " as a shorthand way of saying that during a child 's training period , the structure S occurred only as a result of stimuli that carried the information I , , . Now consider ( I ) S is connected with I1 if and only if the child in whom S occurs has belief A and S is connected with I2 if and only if the child in whom S occurs has belief B. If we knew that ( Z ) were true , then it would be reasonable to think that the difference between I1 and I2 is what accounts for ( or grounds ) the difference between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , is that Dretske does not argue for ( I ) . He just says that , in effect , if S is connected with I1 , the child has one belief and if it 's connected with I2 , the child has the other belief . Acts and Thoughts / 131 This comes out very naturally and plausibly because of the way Dretske puts his case , but it amounts simply to begging the question . Dretske 's argument would become stronger , from a formal point of view , if we added the premise that ( I ) is the only way of explaining how the child who looks at the sparrow and says " robin " could have either of two different beliefs . Quite possibly this is what Dretske has in mind . However , merely to assert this point would beg the question against my account and against ( CV ) . More strongly , if we take Dretske 's argument this way , it can be undercut by showing how an alternative explanation of the possible difference in beliefs can be provided . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us begin with something common to Dretske 's account , my account , and ( CV ) . These views all agree that the conceptual content of S can not be determined just by examining S and the utterance ( namely " robin " ) that results from it in the particular case that we are imagining . Thus , they must further agree that the conceptual content of S can be determined only by appealing to something else . The etiologist looks to a certain feature of causes of the structure S on previous occasions . The other views look to consequences that S has had on previous occasions or may have on future occasions . The decisive cases are those , in which one would expect different actions , depending on whether the child believes that the sparrow is a robin or believes that the sparrow is a non-blue bird . We can construct such a decisive case by imagining that we tell a child to point to non-blue things , provided they are not just like this . As we say " this " we point to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a sparrow in it . I will suppose that , as in Dretske 's first case , S occurs when she looks at the sparrow . However , because of factors not present during the first exposure to a sparrow ( including perhaps , the instruction we have given ) , the child does not on this occasion say " Robin . " There are , of course , other things she can do . Here are two ways in which the scenario we have begun may continue . 13 2. / Acts and Thoughts ( I ) S causally contributes to the child 's pointing at the sparrow . Here we will probably reason that she does not think that the sparrow is just like the robin we pointed at ; that is , she does not think that the sparrow is a robin . This would lead us to assign to S the content " non-blue bird " and to the child the true belief that what she is pointing at is a non-blue bird . ( II ) The child does not point to the sparrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if S had not occurred . Here we will probably reason that she thinks the sparrow is just like the robin we pointed at . This would lead us to assign to S the content " robin " and to the child the false belief that what she is looking at is a robin . These alternative developments show how one can account for the differences of belief that a child could have . They do so by reference to possible differences in the consequences of S. Thus they show how non-etiological views can account for the same fact for which Dretske thinks the etiological view is needed . Two brief comments are in order . ( i ) Dretske will regard the bits of behavior to which I have pointed as being merely evidence for associating different beliefs with S , that is , as evidence upon a matter whose criterion lies in S 's etiology ( cf. 2.09 ) . Now , if we had already established the etiological view , this would be a plausible stance to take . We are , however , still discussing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that argument by premising that the consequences of S described in the preceding paragraph are only evidential and not criterial would clearly be to beg the question . ( ii ) My example is , of course , a thought experiment . This is especially obvious where we have to imagine that we can tell when S occurs , independently of question-begging assumptions about its causes or effects . This can be no objection , however , because Dretske 's view Acts and Thoughts / 133 similarly presupposes the intelligibility , in principle , of being able to identify occurrences of the structure S independently of their causes or effects . I turn now to Dretske 's second argument , which comes from a later section of his book titled " The Informational Origin of Concepts " . The background of this argument involves the proposal that we might be able to teach someone the concept red without ever exhibiting a red thing . We might use only white things illuminated by red light , while cleverly concealing the abnormality of this situation . In such a case , the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for information can not be false ( cf. 45 ) . Thus , if people could acquire the concept red in the way suggested , they could acquire a concept that is not determined by the information contained in any of their internal states . This is contrary to Dretske 's view and consequently he must argue against the possibility of acquiring the concept red in the way just imagined . We must be clear that it is the concept red that Dretske thinks can not be taught without exposure to red things . For , as to the word " red " , Dretske is prepared to concede that it might be teachable in the imagined way . That is , he takes it upon hypothesis that a subject ? whom we may henceforth call " P " ? could be trained on white things reflecting red light in such a way as to " blend in with the rest of us " in both normal and abnormal cases involving color discrimination ( 223 ) . His point is that , even so , P would not possess the concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have shown how all the consequences of possessing the concept red could be exhibited by a person who did not have that concept . This result would rule out my account and ( CV ) and it would be a strong point in favor of the etiological view . Before turning to Dretske 's argument , let us observe that the case he is imagining is truly extraordinary . P is supposed to speak with the rest of us ; thus P must be familiar with the facts that things can appear other than they are and that they can do so because of un134 / Acts and Thoughts usual lighting conditions . This is a lot to learn from illusory examples ; some may say it is entirely too much . However , rather than argue directly about this , I will proceed to offer a dilemma . Either the word " red " can be learned in the way imagined above or it can not . If it can not , it is obvious that Dretske loses a way of arguing for his etiological view . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " red " can be learned from white things illuminated with red light , and see where that is supposed to lead us . Dretske is holding out for the possibility that the concept being used when P says " This is red " is a different concept from our concept red . He introduces the label R for this concept , whatever it is . We shall follow him in this notation . The question at issue can then be neatly stated as : Is R = the concept red ? We can represent a portion of Dretske 's argument in the following way . ( 1 ) P 's concept , R , " can not be the concept red if it correctly applies to nonred things " ( 224 ) . ( z ) R correctly applies to nonred things . Therefore , ( 3 ) R is not = the concept red . Premise ( 1 ) seems evident . Premise ( z ) , however , requires and receives further argument . As one would expect , the nonred things to which Dretske thinks R correctly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dretske 's phrasing leads to a double negative equivalent to ( z ) , that is , the conclusion that these white things are not non-R . We can put the argument as follows . The white things used in P 's training could be non-R only if " there were criteria for the correct application of R that were independent of what the subject was trained to use " ( 224 ) . The idea of such independent criteria does not make sense . Therefore , There are no such criteria . Therefore , The white things used in P 's training are not non-R . Acts and Thoughts / 135 Unfortunately for Dretske 's case , he is not entitled to assert premise ( 4 ) . If the criteria that P was trained to use do not include anything about correcting for abnormal lighting conditions then of course P has not acquired the concept red but at most something like the concept looks red now . This concept is indeed a concept under which the white training objects fall . But it is plainly question-begging to assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not include anything about correcting for abnormal lighting conditions . If we do not assume this , it is open to us to suppose that the criteria of application for R include the requirement that R things must look R under normal conditions . If so , then the white training objects do not fall under the concept R , despite the fact that the whole arrangement is so cleverly contrived that P remains mistaken about this . ( Presumably any of us who get into P 's position all unsuspecting would be mistaken about the color of the training objects also . ) Nor is there anything in the least extraordinary about supposing that the criteria for application of R include reference to normal conditions . After all , ex hypothesi , P has been taught the correct use of the word " red " and so , presumably , would not misclassify things in cases where abnormality of lighting conditions was recognized . What is truly extraordinary is the idea that a person could learn the whole use of the word " red " from illusory examples alone.10 My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make enough of the extraordinariness of this case at the beginning and then , when it does force itself upon him , he mislocates it as affecting only the acquisition of the concept . But whether this diagnosis is correct or not , I think it is clear that Dretske 's second argument has brought us io . It is , of course , not extraordinary at all for a person to learn the word for a particular shade from a situation containing nothing having that shade . One who was already familiar with the use of color words would surely learn what mauve is from being told that this white thing ( which is being viewed in twilight ) just now looks to have the color that mauve things actually have . But if we considered this trivial case , Dretske 's argument would not even appear to go through . 1 36 / Acts and Thoughts no closer than the first one did to having a good reason for believing that the etiological view of conceptual content is true . I turn now to some arguments that are meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . According to the first of these , ( CV ) must fail because it " founders on the circularity inherent in analyzing the content of our internal states in terms of something ( output , response , behavior ) that either lacks the requisite intentional structure . . . or derives what meaning it has from the meaning of its internal cause " ( 203 ) . I have , however , given an account of intentionality that does not appeal to thoughts at all . Thus , if there are thoughts , I could adopt a consequentialist account of their intentionality without circularity ; that is , I could non-circularly assign meanings to thoughts on the basis of utterances and actions of which they were causes . Dretske would undoubtedly wish to retort that now the circularity must lie in the account of intentionality , which does not appeal to the meanings of thoughts . It is quite clear where he would look for trouble in my account ; for he says that " behavior is classifiable as appropriate or inappropriate in relation to the presumed content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zo7 ) . I have , however , gone to some length to show how " behaving like a person who says can be explicated both non-circularly and without appeal to internal states . If my efforts have been successful , I have already answered Dretske 's retort . Two further points are more hinted at than stated by Dretske . Since it is not clear that he puts great weight on them I shall be quite brief . ( i ) Dretske points out that doorbells do not have beliefs that someone is at the door and would not do so even if we hooked their outputs to tapes that played " Someone is at the door . " This observation comes between two claims , each to the effect that the meaningfulness of symbols requires internal states with content ( that is , thoughts ) . ( Cf. 2o4-2o5 ) . Thus the observation seems intended to be some support for those claims . Such a connection can , however , Acts and Thoughts / 137 be undercut by the same considerations that I advanced against the similar claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental acts . The fact that doorbells have no thinkings can perfectly well be accounted for without reference to an absence of thoughts ; it can be accounted for by that fact that doorbells can not behave like a person who says " Someone is at the door " ( aside from the bare sounding of those words , in the case where the bell is replaced by the playing of a tape ) . ( ii ) Dretske refers to the work of Paul Grice and claims that " our verbal behavior means something ( in Grice 's nonnatural sense of " meaning " ) because it is an established way of satisfying certain communicative intentions by agents with certain beliefs " ( 204 ) .11 He evidently thinks of these intentions and beliefs as thoughts and takes the need for them to support the claim that there are thoughts . This , in turn , is taken to support the etiological view because it would be circular to require intentional thoughts in order to have intentional language and require intentional language in order to have intentional thoughts . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a refutation of my account of intentionality that is entirely independent of it . For , without such an independent refutation , it is open to me to take Gricean intentions to be thinkings and to apply my general account to this special case . We may consider , for example , an intention that uttering " p " will produce an effect E through recognition of this intention . The people who have this intention will be just those who behave like a person who says " I 'm going to produce an effect E through having others recognize that this is what I 'm trying to do . " No doubt this is a sentence that could be established by ( RBU ? ) only for some very large n . This is completely consonant , however , with the fact that on 11 . Grice 's work can be found in " Meaning , " Philosophical Review 66(1957) : 377 ? 388 ; " Utterer 's Meaning and Intentions " , Philosophical Review 78 ( 1969 ) : 147 ? 177 ; and " Utterer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Language 4 ( 1968 ) : zz5 ? z4z. 138 / Acts and Thoughts any construal the establishing of a Gricean intention would be a sophisticated business involving several layers of reflection on language . The discussion of Dretske 's arguments has been necessary and has proved fruitful in clarifying the consequences of both ( EV ) and my own account . Before going on , however , we should remind ourselves that I began the discussion with a direct argument against Dretske 's view . Thus , I am not claiming merely that Dretske has not proved his opponents to be wrong . Instead , the position is that there is a countercase for his view and neither the arguments for the view nor those against alternatives do their job . This leaves us with very good reason to reject the view . Consequences In this section I will turn to the main alternative answer to the question " Through what relations might extrinsically intentional thoughts gain their intentionality ? " This answer , we recall , is ( CV ) Thoughts derive their intentionality from certain features of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distinction that it has not been necessary to clarify up to this point but that will be of critical importance in this and the next section . It is a distinction between two ways of regarding the role of thoughts in an account of intentionality . One may regard Thoughts as required for Philosophical Analysis or one may regard Thoughts as required by a Causal Hypothesis . This distinction is spelled out as follows . ( TPA ) Intentionality in utterances and thinkings can not be given a satisfactory philosophical account without introducing thoughts . Intentionality of utterances and thinkings is a logically dependent form of Acts and Thoughts / 139 intentionality , because its existence entails the existence of other things having intentionality ( that is , thoughts ) . ( TCH ) Intentionality in utterances and thinkings can not he given a satisfactory causal account without introducing thoughts . Intentionality of utterances and thinkings is causally dependent on thoughts . There is no entailment ( effects never entail their causes ) , but no rival causal hypothesis is strong enough to overturn the claim that among the causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to mean something or be about something . I shall return to ( TCH ) in the following section . For the present we are to imagine that we are speaking to people who assert ( TPA ) . Naturally , we will ask them how thoughts have their intentionality . Act theorists will say that thoughts have their intentionality intrinsically ; Dretske will say that they get it from the information contained in their causes . These answers , we have seen , have their difficulties , but they at least make prima facie sense as answers to the question how thoughts get their intentionality . The key point about ( CV ) , however , is that it does not make sense as a further answer to this question . For there is no plausible candidate for the effects from which thoughts might derive their intentionality other than behavior , including utterances . One who asserts ( TPA ) and also appeals to ( CV ) is thus caught in a tight circle , deriving intentionality of utterances from intentionality of thoughts , which is derived from intentionality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the point slightly differently . One who works out ( CV ) will have no plausible alternative to saying that a thought is about what the utterance it causes is about . This presupposes that the utterance is about something ; it would hardly make sense to go on to say that 140 / Acts and Thoughts the utterance can be about what it is about only because it is produced by a thought that is about that item.12 If ( TPA ) can be successfully supplemented neither with an act view , nor with ( EV ) , nor with ( CV ) , we have good reason to suppose that it is false . This conclusion gives indirect support to the account of Chapter III . Before accepting this conclusion , however , some may seek the strength accruing from standing on two legs instead of one ; that is , they may attempt a view that combines ( EV ) and ( CV ) and holds that the intentionality of thoughts comes from both their causes and their effects.l3 There are three comments that I shall make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this view is to be added to ( TPA ) then , in so far as effects are appealed to , the circularity would still be present . ( ii ) It seems to me that my countercase for ( EV ) ? the tic in my forearm ? has nothing that even comes close to intentionality . If we now imagine that someone teaches me to notice my tic and to respond to it as a sign of the presence of red things , then one may say it has acquired a meaning for me ; but then all the work of providing intentionality seems to be on the side of the effects . ( iii ) The grain of plausibility in the combined view seems to be able to be accounted for in an alternative , natural way . Consider utterances that report current perceptions . It is open to us to say that their meaning derives from their normal effects but to hold also that these normal effects would not remain normal effects unless perceptual reports were generally true when uttered . This , in turn , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , a point about which Dretske is perfectly clear . My complaint is that his formulations allow one to slide from attributing circularity to ( CV ) + ( TPA ) to attributing it to ( CV ) by itself , and thence to attributing circularity to any view that resembles ( CV ) ( as my account does ) in making the intentionality of an item depend on its consequences . 13 . This would be a natural suggestion from those familiar with Wilfrid Sellars ' " Some Reflections on Language Games . " See his Science , Perception and Reality ( New York : Humanities Press , 1963 ) . Acts and Thoughts / 141 yoking the idea that usually , when a perceptual report is made , the event being reported is causally contributory to the making of the report . It remains to take up a view in which ( CV ) is combined with ( TCH ) . The consideration of this view , however , overlaps with the consideration of another view ( or set of views ) that is currently the focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall make , I shall turn directly to this important view and return to ( TCH ) when a little more background has been provided . Functionalism Functionalism , like many views that enjoy wide appeal , is a braid of many strands , not all equally worthy . Our present purposes require us to isolate two of these and to comment upon them . The first strand is the Functionalist Principle , which we discussed in Chapter I : ( FP ) For an organism to be the subject of a mental predicate M is for that organism to perform the function F. We found this principle unhelpful in Chapter I. However , the predicates with which we were concerned there were of the form " has a sensation of a certain kind " . In the meantime we have argued that we ought to expect the treatment of sensations to differ from the treatment of thinkings . Thus we should ask what ( FP ) leads to when we choose as substituends for " M " the predicates " believes p " or " desires that q ( become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FP ) is that there is some function that an organism performs if and only if these predicates apply to it . If our first strand of functionalism can be given a defensible development , it must be possible to make good on the idea that there is , at least in principle , a way of specifying this function in a non-circular manner . Now , the account of intentionality I have offered can be regarded as doing exactly this job . Thus , as far as this first strand goes , my view is not only compatible 142. / Acts and Thoughts with functionalism but is an instance of it that contains some essential features of its working out . Let us turn to a second strand in functionalism . This strand is the claim that the proper form for psychology to take involves the postulation of thoughts . Since psychology aims to explain behavior and the typical explanation of a piece of behavior involves having a reason , that is , believing something and desiring something , the typical thoughts that one finds being discussed are beliefs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished from believings and desirings . Psychology is supposed to be a science of the causes of behavior . Beliefs and desires are , on the functionalist conception we are about to discuss , internal causes of behavior which can be assigned a meaning or content . This second strand in functionalism is connected with the first in the following way . Beliefs and desires are brain states with meaning . But the meaning that a thing has does not follow from what physical properties it has , for example , how many neurons are involved or how frequently they fire . Instead , the meaning of a brain state is a functional property of it , that is , a property it has in virtue of performing a certain function in the economy of brain states leading to behavior . It should be clear , however , that this second strand is a genuine addition to the first . In the account of intentionality for which I have argued , the first strand is present without any commitment to a causal background of thoughts . The second strand in functionalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . In this context , ( TCH ) is naturally allied with the consequentialist view , ( CV ) . For it is a compelling idea that if a brain state has a special role in causing an utterance of p and behavior like that of a person who says " p " , and it does not have that special role in causing other utterances or actions , then it should be assigned the meaning p . So far , I have only tried to clarify the background against which ( TCH ) appears plausible . I turn now to a discussion of it . The first Acts and Thoughts / 143 comment I wish to make is that strictly speaking I have no interest in whether ( TCH ) is true or not . I have given a philosophical account of intentionality . This account is properly opposed to ( TPA ) and I must therefore argue against that claim . But this is not a book on psychology and I am not obligated to offer a theory of the causes of intentionality . It is enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required for it to be had by anything . I am , however , not content to leave the matter here . The reason is that I fear that some will think that ( TCH ) is obvious ? so obvious that no reasonable person could deny it , at least when it is put forth as a general conception without details as to exactly what form the causes of behavior take . The reason this supposition of obviousness is to be feared is that it will make possible a confusion to the effect that there is n't much difference between ( TCH ) and an analysis of intentionality . It will make possible the mistaken view that we need not worry about the circularity problem , because we do not need behaviorism in any form , because we have a functionalist account of intentionality that we can use in place of behaviorism . To combat these mistakes and confusions , I will argue , not that ( TCH ) is false , but that it is not obvious , that is , that it could be denied without absurdity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) turns out to be true , it is only a causal fact about intentionality that does not tell us what it is or help us to understand the main problem of how a purely physical thing could have it . A discussion of the following quotation from Jerry Fodor will enable us to bring out some key points . He writes : Your standard contemporary cognitive psychologist ? your thoroughly modern mentalist ? is disposed to reason as follows . To think ( e.g. , ) that Marvin is melancholy is to represent Marvin in a certain way ; viz. as being melancholy ( and not , for example , as being maudlin , morose , moody , or merely moping and dyspeptic ) . But surely we can not represent Marvin as being 144 / Acts and Thoughts melancholy except as we are in some or other relation to a representation of Marvin ; and not just to any representation of Marvin , but , in particular , to a representation the content of which is that Marvin is melancholy , a representation which , as it were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fortiori , at least some mental states/processes are or involve at least some relations to at least some representations.14 This passage claims to present a piece of reasoning , yet its key move is so quick as to give us hardly an argument at all . It begins by setting out to tell us what it is to think that Marvin is melancholy . Notice that if our thinking that Marvin is melancholy is already conceived as an internal representation , or thought in our regimented sense , then there is no reasoning in the second sentence of the quoted passage : that sentence is just a tautology . So let us assume ( what seems evident in any case ) that the passage means to start with something completely uncontentious ? that is , that sometimes we believe that Marvin is melancholy ? and move to the conclusion that when cases like this are at hand , there are internal representations . If we ask what justifies this move , we find nothing in the second sentence ; representations are introduced as if the need for them was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but surely " only reinforces the impression that something is believed to be too obvious to need serious argument . But suppose we do take the need for an argument here seriously ? There is just one hint in this passage as to where we might look . It is the fact that Fodor feels it is somehow relevant to mention some of the other things we might have thought about Marvin . When I ask myself why Fodor should be moved to write down these contrasts , the only answer I find is that he must be thinking as follows : We can think that Marvin is melancholy or that Marvin is 14 . See Jerry Fodor , " Methodological Solipsism Considered as a Research Strategy in Cognitive Psychology " , reprinted in his Representations ( Cambridge , Mass. : MIT Press , 1981 ) . The quotation is from p. 1z5 . Acts and Thoughts / 145 maudlin or that Marvin is morose or . . . and so on . Cases of thinking in these ways have a certain similarity ? they 're all about Marvin ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marvin 's being melancholy , another about his being maudlin , and so on . Now , cases of thinking in these ways have causes . Surely these causes have analogous similarities and differences . They are internal states ( brain states ) since , after all , behavior is caused by brain states and when we think something about Marvin we are disposed to behave in certain ways . So there must be brain states that are causes of our behavior , which are systematically similar and different in ways that parallel the similarities and differences of the statements ( or , to use Fodor 's term , propositions ) " Marvin is melancholy " , " Marvin is maudlin " , and so on . If this really is what is supporting Fodor 's story about representations , then we ought to recognize that we do not have good reason for accepting that story . For the line of reasoning just sketched rests on a claim that we may call the Principle of Isomorphism of Causes and Effects : ( PICE ) Whenever two effects share a feature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is unacceptable.ls For one thing , it implies that a new structure could never arise . Given any structure , ( PICE ) projects it , so to speak , back onto its cause ; but another application of the principle would project the same structure back onto the cause of the cause , and so on ad infinitum . This kind of ancestry for structure is clearly not required . For example , my nose is between my eyes , which are between my ears . Surely , this bit of structure is 15 . It may appear that I have used this principle myself when I argued in Chapter I that small changes in neural causes should be expected to bring about small changes in qualities of sensations . This , however , is an argument based on considerations of continuity and not on isomorphism of structure . 146 / Acts and Thoughts causally dependent on my genes , but we have no reason to suppose that we can assign genes to body parts in such a way that we can find counterpart relations holding among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have no reason to suppose that there is a relation among genes that corresponds in any neat way to the betweenness of nose and eyes , and eyes and ears . We thus have no reason to suppose that the genetic cause of our bodily structure has a structure isomorphic to our bodies . One might object that genes are not the complete cause of our bodily structure . Our nutritive environment is also a necessary condition for our development . This is , of course , true ; but adding the nutritive environment does not give us any reason to suppose that the causes of our structure will be isomorphic to our structure , under some correspondence of genes-plus-nutrients to elements of our structure . These remarks can be applied to ( TCH ) as follows . We have good reason to doubt ( PICE ) . If that principle is false , then we should expect that sooner or later in the series of causes stretching back from our utterances , there will be causes that do not have a structure parallel to that of our utterances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be difficult to treat them as analogous to statements ( or propositions ) . But , lacking direct evidence about the details of the workings of the brain , we really are not in a position to say how many steps back in the causal chain we would have to go to come to causes without a structure that parallels that of our utterances . We do not really know that this situation does n't happen at the first step back from the effects ( that is , our utterances ) . But if it does happen that soon , ( TCH ) is false . Thus , we are really not in a position to know that ( TCH ) is not false . There is one further argument that might be advanced here , either in conjunction with Fodor 's line of thought or independently of it . This argument begins with the idea that reasons cause actions . Further premises are that reasons are composed of beliefs and desires Acts and Thoughts / 147 and that brain states are the causes of actions . The conclusion to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified with reasons , that is , with beliefs and desires . So thoughts ( beliefs and desires ) will be required as causes of actions ? required , that is , if we are not to be forced to give up the view ( which is surely correct ! ) that reasons cause actions.16 To reply to this line of thought it is necessary and sufficient to exhibit a way of reading " Beliefs and desires cause actions " that has the following two characteristics . ( a ) It must capture all that we are entitled to by the common sense observation that people act for reasons , that is , that they act on the basis of what they believe and what they want . ( b ) The reading must obviously not imply ( TCH ) . I hope that by this point it will not be difficult to anticipate how such a reading can be given . One could put it several ways : one of them is this . " The causes of believings and desirings are the causes of actions . " This really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of the causes of our actions . When one thinks about the connection between ascribing thinkings and behaving like people who say " p " ( cf. ( TTA ) ) it is easy to see that the sentence just quoted comes to about the same as this one : the causes that make us behave like people who say " p " and the causes that make us behave like people who say " q " are sometimes both at work in particular cases , that is , cases in which we behave like people who say both " p " and 16 . Both Fodor 's idea and this line of argument can be found in a passage from William Lycan , " Psychological Laws " , Philosophical Topics iz ( 1981 ) : 9-38 . The passage , which appears on p. 18 , runs as follows : " What kind of homunctional state might a belief-state be ? I take it to be obvious that beliefs have structures of some kind , both on intuitive and on theoretical grounds . Intuitively , because the belief that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetarian share an element of some kind ( either Donald himself or some mental representation of him ) , as do the belief that Donald is intelligent and the belief that Dan is intelligent ; theoretically , because ( seemingly ) we must suppose Dan 's belief that the liquid in front of him is beer and his desire to drink beer share a component if we are to explain their joint function in causing Dan to reach for the liquid in front of him . " 148 / Acts and Thoughts " q " . The truistic character of this claim is just as it ought to be . Our common sense knowledge of people 's motivation does not give us insight into the workings of the brain . My conclusion from this discussion is that ( TCH ) is not a triviality , but a genuine causal hypothesis ; it is neither a necessary nor an a priori truth , but a contingent claim that we have not yet established . This conclusion ought to make it clear that even if ( TCH ) turns out to be true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentionality . CHAPTER V Self-Consciousness The proper form of a report of the occurrence of a sensation is " I have such and such a kind of sensation . " In Chapter I , I discussed sensations at length but I said very little about having sensations or about what is behind the idea that I have them . The purpose of the present chapter is to articulate what it is for a person to have a sensation and to respond to a number of objections , conundrums , and confusions surrounding this topic . In the course of doing this I shall be making good on two promissory notes from Chapter I. One of these requires discussion of an argument for adverbialism . The other requires an explanation of how to resist the temptation to introduce awareness of sense-data as an analysis of sensations . It will shortly be necessary to introduce feelings into our discussion . I put these in the same class with sensations , for a reason that by now should sound familiar . It is because we can not find any way in which brain states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way of understanding why a certain ratio of neuron firing frequencies or durations or intensities and so on should compose a feeling of frustration rather than one of elation or fear or pleasant familiarity . We could discover only that one such ratio is correlated with a particular feeling . This would not give us grounds for an identity claim . It would give us good grounds for accepting the view that brain states cause feelings and indeed I think that this is the only reasonable view to take . 149 150 / Self-Consciousness I shall occasionally want to make remarks that apply indifferently to all of the non-physical things that I have recognized ? that is , sensations , images , and feelings . To do this it will be convenient to have a single term . I thus introduce the technical term " content " to serve this purpose . No particular emphasis will be placed on the question " What contains contents ? " However , it does have an answer , namely " People . " Contents would naturally appear on a list of all there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer can not be evident , however , until the end of the following section . The Unity of the Self Looking Into Oneself One 's own self is often spoken of as near ( as well as dear ) and as available to knowledge by the simple activity of introspection or looking into oneself ( or one 's mind ) . David Hume is probably the most famous introspector and he has reported his results in the following well-known passage . For my part , when I enter most intimately into what I call myself , I always stumble on some particular perception or other , of heat or cold , light or shade , love or hatred , pain or pleasure . I never can catch myself at any time without a perception , and never can observe any thing but the perception . ' Many people , including Hume , 2 have found this passage problematic . Hume 's main point , however ? that we do not find in introspection any always-present possessor of our " perceptions " ? seems to me to be incontestably true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes so many think there must be something wrong with r . David Hume , A Treatise of Human Nature , reprinted in C. W. Hendel , Jr. , Hume Selections ( New York : Scribner 's , 19z7 ) , p. 84 . Parenthetical references in this section are to pages of this edition . z . See Appendix to Book I of Hume 's Treatise , pp. io3-ro6 . Self-Consciousness / 151 it . There are two facts about what I find when I look into myself that Hume does not mention and that seem to provide the answer . Some of our feelings are quite definite , like the feeling that goes with extreme frustration or the feeling that one has after suddenly being frightened and then realizing there is actually no danger . Other feelings are more elusive . One such feeling is the feeling of comfortable familiarity . We do not always have such a feeling when we are in comfortable and familiar surroundings , but sometimes the familiar does feel familiar . Another is the feeling of knowing where we are or where our destinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction " . We do not have such a feeling all the time that we know where we are but we can have it , and we can contrast that feeling with what it feels like to be lost or what it feels like to come upon something from an unexpected angle and realize that we have been disoriented for some time . Among the elusive feelings is one that seems to lie behind our sense of ourselves . This is the feeling that we can connect our contents with our context . By this I mean the feeling that if we were asked what sensations immediately preceded any we are now having ; we could answer correctly ; that if we are having an image of a past action , we could say what came before and after it , why we did it , and how people reacted to it . We feel that we could give reasons for assertions made in our inner speech and explain why we happen to be silently soliloquizing about whatever topic it is that we are concerned with.3 I am not saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizing the feeling I am talking about when he wrote , " We only feel a connection or determination of the thought , to pass from one object to another . It follows , therefore , that the thought alone finds personal identity , when reflecting on the train of past perceptions , that compose a mind , the ideas of them are felt to be connected together , and naturally introduce each other " ( ro6 ) . However , the feeling Hume describes here differs from the one to which I am calling attention in two respects . First , the former is a feeling of the passage of particular perceptions , while the latter is a feeling that one can go on in many directions , without any particular direction for going on having yet been suggested . Second , the former is a feeling of the naturalness of the passage of perceptions , while the latter is a feeling that can be contained within one complex ( but not temporally complex ) content .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
