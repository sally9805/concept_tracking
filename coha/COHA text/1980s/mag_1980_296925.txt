She throws one arm around a young white mercenary , the other around a black soldier , and kisses them . Like the protagonist in the title story of this new collection , Nadine Gordimer has been caught by historical confrontations and gone on to embrace them . For more than 25 years , the native South African has been writing abidingly clear-eyed , humane fiction that comprehends both sides , but never evades the profound issues of racism . <P> Her Africa is a vast territory of ambiguities and paradoxes .

A chief finds that his village has become a refuge for rebels . He travels to an army post to report these strangers ; he wants them arrested to save his people from breaking federal law . But by the time he returns home , the army , acting on his information , has obliterated the village . The chief hangs himself . <P> In all 13 stories , Gordimer marks details with a keen , sympathetic intelligence - the way " beaded water looked oyster-shell blue " on a wading black girl 's legs ; a scared Swedish girl taking the hand , " cold and tough as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun-bearer who had never before been touched by a white woman " ; the way a servant 's " manner towards white people was based on the personality of the white person she worked for .
