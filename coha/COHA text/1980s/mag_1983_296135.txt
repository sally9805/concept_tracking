Arms Control <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> Your article on nuclear disarmament April 18 suggests a morality play the American negotiator is the good guy ( the white chess pieces ) , while the Soviets are represented by the black . But your artist also invokes a more subtle truth . In chess the white player moves first . The U S initially developed and deployed these weapons . It introduced each new advancement and continued to build its arsenal . Having led the world to this impasse , why should Americans expect someone else to take the lead in giving up arms ? <P> <P> Geoff Wichert <P> Portland , Ore . <P> <P> The idea of promoting " de-MIRVing " schemes that would lead to more survivable , less threatening missiles terrifies me It is precisely this assurance that could lead to a nuclear war . <P> <P> Farhat Biviji <P> Cherry Hill , N.J. <P> <P> " Speak softly and carry a big stick " is one of the most sensible policies to come out of the U.S. in this century . Ronald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space-based ABM system . <P> Sabino Grassi <P> St. Lonard , Que . <P> <P> I was surprised at the one-sided nature of your discussion in " Freeze No De employment Yes . " This piece ignored all the substantive arguments in favor of a nuclear freeze . For example , it asserted that the freeze almost by definition " is not verifiable . But an array of experts , including former Director of the CIA William Colby former Defense Secretary Clark Clifford and former Chief Arms Control Negotiator Paul Warnke , have stated that a freeze is indeed adequately verifiable , and perhaps more verifiable than many other arms control proposals , including President Reagan 's START plan . <P> I do not dispute the right of TIME to print editorials , even if they are not labeled as such . However , when I read this story I thought that perhaps you had mistakenly reprinted without change a press release from the office of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger . <P> <P> Edward M.

The proponents of this position probably also believe they can not be seen if they cover their eyes . <P> <P> James B. Wood <P> Edgefield , S.C . <P> <P> If , as you say , " parity is not a static condition ; it is dynamic , " we will go on as we have for the past 38 years playing catchup , until ultimately , inevitably , by accident or design , the U.S. or the U.S.S.R. blows the earth to smithereens . <P> <P> Paul W. Fernald <P> New Bedford , Mass . <P> <P> To brand President Reagan a failure in his attempts to achieve arms control is ridiculous . The simple fact is that as long as the Soviets perceive themselves as having a decisive military advantage they will never negotiate an equitable agreement . <P> <P> Frank C. Horvath <P> St. Louis <P> Nagging Nicaragua <P> The U.S. will eventually have to fight the Sandinistas in Nicaragua April 18 . Consequently , we should not turn our backs on the Nicaraguan contras .
