The parties stand for plenty-and are far apart <P> Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times ? That all depends on which party platform you read and believe . <P> And indeed they are written for the true believer , for they admit of no possible party flaw . If there are national problems , those are the fault of the other party , which is castigated at length . As Finley Peter Dunne 's fictional commentator Mr. Dooley noted of a practiced platform writer , " Whin he can denounce an ' deplore no longer , he views with alarm an ' declares with indignation . " <P> So many planks are crammed into the platform to satisfy different interest groups that Barry Goldwater once dismissed the whole exercise as a " packet of misinformation and lies . " Presidential candidates have frequently repudiated their party platforms . In 1864 the Democratic platform called for an immediate end to the Civil War , but Party Nominee George McClellan insisted on continuing the fight against the Confederacy . Franklin Roosevelt piled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call for a balanced budget . In 1971 Richard Nixon totally ignored the G.O.P. platform when he imposed wage and price controls and announced , " I am now a Keynesian in economics . " <P> Yet every four years , party members battle over their platforms as if they were writing another Constitution . They demand that certain planks be added , others withdrawn , and insist on nuances that would baffle the most finicky pedant . The fact is that platforms are greater than the sum of their planks . They indicate the direction in which a party is heading ; at the least they exercise a subliminal influence on the nominee and , if he is elected , on his policies . Occasionally , vital issues are at stake . The refusal of the Republican Party to compromise with slavery in 1860 marked a turning point in American history ; so did the adoption by the Democrats of the " free silver " * plank in 1896 . The struggle over the Viet Nam War plank at the 1968 Democratic Convention split the party and led to Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear alternatives , two distinct views of life and Government . Basically , the Democrats support an activist , interventionist Government , while the Republicans want to reduce the federal presence . Declares the G.O.P. : " Government 's power to take and tax , to regulate and require , has already reached extravagant proportions . Divided , leaderless , unseeing , uncomprehending , Democratic politicians plod on with listless offerings of pale imitations of the same policies they have pursued so long , knowing full well their futility . " <P> Democrats , on the other hand , maintain that they have " put the Federal Government back in the business of serving our people . " Their platform boasts of the additional spending under Jimmy Carter : " Funding for education up 75% over the Ford budget ; Head Start up 73% , basic skills programs up 233% , bilingual education up 113% , Native American education up 124% , summer jobs up 66% , Medicare up 54% , National Health Service Corps up 179% , Women , Infants and Children Program up 300% .
