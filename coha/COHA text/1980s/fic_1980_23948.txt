THE COPPER BALLOONS A short story by Lewis Nordan W HEN HE LEFT for work , his wife said she thought he might be running a slight fever . It did n't matter to Toby McNaughton . He felt wonderful , as if something new and uncommon were about to happen in his life . All the way , on the drive from his mobile home in Siloam Springs , down the highway that led through the deep woods where he sometimes hunted , past the brown-stubble pastures full of rich men 's horses , past the low-slung chicken-houses and bluffs and outcroppings , into the sturdy little Ozark city , right through the factory gates , Toby McNaughton felt that today was special . That he himself was special . The security guard , a uniformed man with a leather-bound clock slung from his shoulder on a strap , checked his pass and waved him through . With the others arriving on the first shift , Toby walked from the parking lot and through the factory doors . Lockers were already clattering and coffee was being brewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opened the door and put away his jacket . He took out his cap and safety glasses and rubber boots and leather gloves . Why was it a person felt this way ? He felt friendly , he spoke to everyone . Girls seemed more beautiful , the sporting-goods factory was a comfortable home . He slammed the locker shut and stood in line at the clock . In just twelve hours he would be back home again . The memory and sweet taste of his wife Kate remained with him , and the vision of their young son , still asleep in his bed . The raise had come through  --  just a dime , but that was all right . The company had agreed to Washington 's Birthday as a paid holiday . It was a fine day for Toby McNaughton . He took his card from the rack and slipped it into the clock . Clack , it was imprinted . Sweet overtime , sweet time-and-a-half this afternoon . He checked his mailbox . The factory sounds had already begun , the whine and thump of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music of forklifts humming through the plant , warehouse doors opening , gliding up the trolleys and folding open at the ceiling with a clash . In his mailbox , he saw what he had forgotten . The thing he should have been expecting , anticipating . His correspondence course had come . The brown package , a large , padded envelope with a neat mailing sticker , lay in the box , his name and the address of the company printed neatly on it . He wanted to open it right away , tear the staples loose and reach down into the envelope and take it out immediately . He checked the clock above the business-office door and decided to wait . The factory sounds were growing louder now ; he knew he had better get his own machines running . Then he would look . " Introduction to Business Finance " was the name of the course . You could never tell  --  it might lead to something . Toby walked to Screw Machine . The foreman from last night 's dog shift had set the machines , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked each breech and feeder and threader . He checked the rod troughs and safety lights , then sat on a low stool to slip into his boots and glasses . He opened the breeches and started the machines , one at a time . He listened to their groans and heaves and , finally , to the shrill efficiency as , one by one , they reached the high rpms . His foreman came in with a cup of coffee . Seven screw machines were Toby 's age , in their twenties , were starting their machines also . The foreman indicated with his cup that he would be in the break room in case he was needed . It was the usual beginning of a day . Toby fed a series of brass rods into the No. 3 , 4 , and 7 machines . The other men did the same on the I , 2 , 5 , and 6 . At the opposite end . new-made screws began piling up in the bins . The fragrance of the warm oil that cooled the machines was delicious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ np ? ? ? ? ? - T MS WAS THE MOMENT of the day when Toby 's job seemed most pleasant . With the machines running , he felt com- pletely alone and private . He put oil-filled earplugs into his ears , to protect against damage , and he entered into what he thought of as a loud , familiar silence , a time in which he spoke to no one and no one spoke to him . There were others nearby , the guys on the other machines , the foreman who , throughout the day , came in and out , checking equipment . Across the aisle , on the punch press , there was the Indian girl , a teenager , who sometimes caught his eye . There were maintenance men on forklifts , and sometimes an inspector . Mostly , though , there was just himself . His communication with others required only a nod , a glance . The floor vibrated soothingly beneath his feet . The machines were running smoothly . Toby lifted the brown envelope from a barrel of shavings and rested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stool in the corner and opened his package . When he drew out its contents , his eyes would not at first focus properly on the book and packet of study sheets and directions . The textbook was a wafer-thin , reddish book in a cloth binding . At the lower right corner was stamped the copper-colored imprint of three small balloons and a gondola depending from them . He opened the book at random and looked inside . He was confused . It was as if he were looking at a foreign language  --  he might as well have been . He closed the book and looked at the title , embossed in coppery lettering on the spine . A History of the English Language . He was not angry , not even particularly frustrated . A computer somewhere had sent him the wrong course . It was not the first time such a thing had happened . There was no promise from the factory 's management to promote Toby , no matter how many courses he took  --  a few more weeks of waiting for the proper course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain emotion , a certain strangeness , looking at this book , at these instructions and lessons . It was a part of the same feeling he had experienced in the morning , a premonition of change . A small sound . a difference in the machine noise , attracted his attention . It was No. 3 . A screw had jammed in the threader and had caused it to stop , to heat up a little . Toby put his instruction materials aside and unbreeched the rod . It was a simple matter to remove the piece of metal from the threader and feed the rod through again . The screws again began to pile up in the bin , the brass shavings on the floor . He signaled Maintenance to empty his barrels ofshavings . When they were done , he swept the shop floor with a stiff broom and started filling the barrels again . He could have signaled one of the other boys to spread sawdust , to soak up the accumulation of oil on the floor  --  but there was no need . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strangeness had not left him . He was intrigued by the materials he had found in his envelope . He might have just opened an old chest and found treasure . He sat and stripped the cellophane wrapper from the packet of instructions . Inside the booklet , in black , was the same tiny imprint of the balloons and gondola . He trembled as he read  --  it was a section titled " Introduction . " He felt he was being spoken to by an actual voice . He wished he could see the face behind the voice . It would be a man in a suit , very old and rich . He would sit at a desk in an office with glass walls , the Great Divide , the blue Rockies , visible behind him . He would lift a pen from the desk top and uncap it . He would write on paper the color of bone . The words would say that language was a vast balloon , three balloons , with a gondola dangling beneath them on silk ropes . It was copper balloons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magical enough to float away , immense and weightless , three copper balloons with a gondola beneath , as large as civilization , all past and present . The balloons rose up . In the gondola rode all the company of heaven and earth , all peoples and wars and inventions , all circus animals and trapeze dancers , it carried a million gods and graves , Cochise risen , Helios draped in sunlight ( where had he seen this , an illustration in the text , a caption ? ) . he saw flocks and bees and gardens and herds , gatherers and dwarfs and madmen . Toby 's mind reeled . He looked back at the page . It had not said that . What had come over him ? The words had made his imagination see things that were not there . He felt frightened ; he had never been so happy . He put down the instruction booklet and opened the text . He read words he had never known existed , words he could not pronounce but that pronounced themselves in his mind . He read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell . He thought of the gondola and of the history of words , the words he had said this morning when he left home , " I love you , Kate , " and " I 'll see you tonight , honey , " and " Kiss the boy for me , " and all the rest . He imagined other persons , in other times and nations , saying the same words , men in Viking hats or animal skins or space suits , women in their beauty . He imagined the gondola and the copper balloons , thin as tissues , a cornucopia of  - -  mar - words and creatures spilling out , calling out in his own voice . He looked carefully at the page . He turned the pages slowly . He saw a little poem , four lines of unrecognizable words , beneath them a translation . He read the translation . A little while the leaves are green ; then afterwards they fall to earth ; they rot away ; they turn to dust . He thought how true this was , how perfectly true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he hunted squirrels , the small river that ran through them carrying yellow leaves on its surface , the river 's sandy banks , animal tracks in the sand , sometimes a wet-muzzled deer . hoof-deep in leaf mold , looking up at him . He thought of the abandoned mill upstream , where , sometimes , he lay his dead squirrels and , with a sharp knife , separated them from their skins and threw the bright guts into the stream . He thought of the concrete foundation , so distant from present civilization that it was not even littered , no charred remains of campfires , no beer cans or rubbers or scrawled names . He thought of the steady music of the spillway , the unrecognizable pieces of rusted machinery that lay near the water , where the mill wheel had been . ? ' . . . relationships ... , " a voice seemed to say , from nowhere . He turned and almost collided with someone , a person standing scarcely inches away from him , who seemed to have been talking to him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Lance Eisen , one of the other men on Screw Machine . How long had he been talking ? " Wait , " Toby shouted at him . It was time to feed the machines again . He took brass rods from the troughs and fed them in . He poured fresh oil through each machine and enjoyed the fragrance , the warmth . Eisen was still talking . Just what was going on here ? Nobody talked in this noise . Toby took out an earplug and moved away from the machine , toward the corner where he had been sitting . Eisen towered over Toby . He was at least six feet five , with brilliant black hair and eyes . He was crying . Could this be possible ? They had never spoken more than a dozen words  --  just hello and goodbye and do you want some coffee . The heavy doors at Receiving opened , across the plant , and flooded the floor of Main Assembly and part of Screw Machine with sunlight and cold air . A tractor-trailer , loaded with flattened cardboard boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed again . Toby thought again of the book . He took off his gloves and picked up the book . He thought of Northumbria and the copper balloons . He thought of the ruined mill and the poem of green leaves and decay . " . . . age . . . it 's . . . up , " Eisen said , or seemed to say . Toby motioned him to speak directly into his ear . " . . . marriage . . . up , " Eisen said . " Louder , " Toby shouted . He gripped his new book and instruction materials tightly in his arms . He felt giddy and flushed . Eisen was still crying . He shouted into Toby 's ear again . Toby was afraid he might be sick . Eisen 's marriage was breaking up , Eisen shouted , above the seven screw machines . Toby gave his machines a quick check again , breech , threader , feeder . He checked the oil level . To keep his sanity , he also checked the Indian girl . This time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in profile , the rust-colored skin and fine nose , the high cheekbones . He imagined her on the gondola , beneath the copper balloons . Her hair net , which the women wore for safety , became a beaded band , then full headdress . The machine-key , on a string around her neck , became a necklace made of squash blossoms  --  they made him think of fertility and youth . He saw horses and spears and paint , he saw beehive ovens and pottery and looms and drums . He saw his own son a papoose asleep on a cradleboard , he saw in her the Indian women in his trailer park and from the reservation , toothless squaws shooting pool in the back room of Muskogee beer halls , he saw medicine men in three-piece suits and braves drinking wine from sacks . He heard their language , their drums and chants and smoke clouds , all of them saying , " Northumbrian , Mercian , West Saxon , " speaking a harmony of the Gospels , speaking a dream of the Rood , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just read . He did not want to talk to Lance Eisen . Eisen shouted into his ear ; he seemed to say , " Have no fun . Get drunk . " Eisen 's large hands were cupped directly over Toby 's ear now , and he was shouting full strength . All his sentences were chopped short , or seemed to be , like the words of Indians in movies . " Bicycle , " he shouted . " Long trip . " It was painful . Toby 's head was ringing . Eisen was not talking about his wife , he was talking about a young woman he had known briefly in the army . The two of them . along with another couple , had taken a long bicycle trip through Germany . All of them had got drunk the first day out , but Eisen was drunkest . He could n't get over the vomiting and diarrhea for two days . " Oh , Jesus ! " Toby tried to cry out , but could not . His head was killing him . His emotions had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could only listen . He could not get away . The ma-The words had made his imagination see things that were not there . chines screamed and made brass screws . The bins filled with precise , twisted creatures , like sea animals , and the floors with shavings that looked like gold . He could not get away , because he knew why Lance had decided to tell him this . Weeks ago . Toby had told a navy story in the break room , an adventure on a train in Italy  --  the hooting diesel , the beautiful Italian sisters who befriended him , the food and wine and sex , the cheesecakes and flowers and fresh fruit . Eisen had loved the story , had taken it to heart and believed every word . Its message was the beauty of sex and adventure , the inseparability of the two . He was judging himself against the story . Toby wanted to get the story back , he wanted never to have spoken the words . The story was a lie . " I could n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the girl in Germany . Toby shouted back at him , " Lance , I was lying . " He did n't hear . Lance had Toby cornered now , holding his shoulder and weeping and shouting into his ear . " It rained , " Eisen said , " turned cold . She got her period . " " Lance , I lied . The Italian girls were a lie . " " She got drunk . Vomited . . . . " The machines pounded and screamed and made screws . Toby tried to pull away . Eisen held him and shouted into his ear . " We kissed , " Eisen shouted , still crying . " All tongues , you know . " " Oh , Christ , help me ! " " Little pieces of vomit  --  they were down in her throat . " " Mother of God ! " " Sex  --  it 's so awful . Oh , God , it is . " The copper balloons , with the gondola beneath them , tilted and swayed and rose up . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures , dwarfs and satyrs and monsters Toby McNaughton could not remember ever having heard of . His wife spilled out , too , his Kate , and he himself , as they would be this evening when he got home . They would sit together on the sofa and watch the television news , with their supper plates on their laps . His son spilled out , the baby , as Toby would watch him tonight , sitting in the water of the bathtub , surrounded by toys , a green duck , and a plastic bowl . He would put him in his bed clean and warm and sweet smelling , wearing crinkled pajamas . They would watch the mobile , made of tiny mirrors in the shape of fish , that hung from the ceiling and sparkled with the last light of evening as it filtered through the windows of his sunny room . He would lie beside him on the bed and prop abright storybook on his stomach . He would feel grateful never to have to lie to the child , never to hide from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss his still-damp hair , and no words would come between them . Eisen was still shouting into his ear , his head was ringing with pain . " My wife reminds me of her . I 'm impotent with my wife . " T OBY MCNAUGHTON was shoved into the corner now , all the way against the wall . There was nowhere to go , no escape . Even as Eisen shouted his story , Toby opened the book in his hand , hoping to find the quiet poem , with the green leaves . He could not . His eyes fell , instead , on a verse from an ancient Bible . The words were magic . There was a translation beneath them , but he understood them already . He could pronounce them , he knew their meaning . He thought of Pentecostal preachers speaking in tongues , Indian prophets translating chicken guts to words . He gloried in the sound and in the meaning . Heofanas and englas , sunnan and monan , steorran and ear6an. ealle nytenu and fugelas , sae and ealle fixas God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the verse to Lance , but Lance was still shouting into his cupped hands , into Toby 's ear . " Relationships , " he was shouting . He tried to tell Lance that these words were important , that all words were . He tried to tell him that words , even in our solitude , are magic , they make us part of something larger and better , their rhythms as well as their meaning , the way they look . He tried to say that they can kill you , too , they are dangerous and animallike. they are monstrous and deceptive and godly , they fall from copper balloons , heofanas and englas , the heavens and the angels , the sun and the moon , the stars and the earth , all beasts and birds and fish God created , and it happened in six days . Lance shouted , " She says relationships , but I know she means fucking . " Toby was glad his own words were not getting through to Lance , that he was not being heard . Everything he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with the same meaning it had had in his brain . He tried to tear the page out of the book and let Lance read it for himself . It tore across the center . He tried to tear out the other half and show them both to him . It was no use . He thought of raccoon tracks in river sand , minnows in the stream . " It 's a sick world , " Toby cried out . He was crying now , too . " It 's not your fault , " he said . " It 's a bad , sick world . " He stood weeping in the corner . 60 The machines made gold-colored screws , shavings piled up on the floor . Then , it ended . After a long time , it was over . Toby was finished crying . Lance was gone . A boy with a sawdust bucket scattered sweet-scented stuff on the oily floor and emptied the bins . Toby dried his eyes on his sleeves and blew his nose on a handkerchief . He wondered who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having noticed . It was hard to imagine that he had been so distraught , that he could have been trapped like that . It was impossible not to wonder what was wrong with him . His body ached . He listened to the sound of the machinery . Two of the screw machines had needed a rod for a good while now , but no damage was done . In a few minutes , the screws were filling the bins again . Toby looked at the torn page of his new book . Why on earth had he done that ? He hated doing things like that ; he would never get a full refund now . His head was aching badly . For a minute he thought he might cut the page out with a razor , very neatly , and not mention it when he sent it back to the company . No , he would n't do that . He did n't know what he would do . He was very tired . He signaled the foreman and went to the infirmary for aspirin . Later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat across from him . He recognized her as Lance Eisen 's wife , who worked in Paint . She had dark blonde hair and wore makeup to cover a few acne scars on her forehead and cheeks . For a moment they said nothing . Then she said , " I think it 's funny . " Her voice was bitter and hurt . " I think that is just so funny . " Toby McNaughton put down his sandwich and tried to think of something to say . He wanted the day to end . She said , " So you think I 'm sick , do you ? Well , I think that is just so funny . " He could n't imagine what Lance had told her . She got up and left the table , crying . Later still , Toby would learn that the Eisens had punched out early and gone home . The next day , Toby would miss work , with a high fever a virus , the doctor would say , and in another day it would be gone . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not look at him or speak to him . In two more days , Mrs. Eisen  --  whose name , Toby would learn , was Marilyn would come to work with a black eye and a swollen lip . She would not be wearing her wedding ring . In weeks to come , Lance would tell Toby that he was embarrassed at what he had said and that he hoped Toby would not repeat any of it . Toby would promise that he would not , but within a few days he would have told his wife and several other persons , some of them at the plant . Soon after that , Marilyn Eisen would come to work wearing her wedding ring again , and , not too long afterward , would tell her best friends that she was pregnant . Toby 's correspondence course would finally come in the mail , the right one this time , and no charge would be made for the damaged book . For a while Toby would enjoy " Business Finance " and would turn in his assignments regularly . Then , finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After completing about half the course , he would put it aside and . finally , forget it . Lance would be invited to help out temporarily in Engineering and , before the end of the year , would be working on a new patent with one of the real engineers , a man who said Lance could have a real future with the company . At first Toby would feel some jealousy , but later he would forget about that , too . The day of the incident with Lance , he would go home , his head splitting , and he would drink too much and wonder that he had ever married so young and fathered a child , and although he would be too drunk to make successful love to his wife , on this day and on other days also , they would pledge their love and fall asleep in each other 's arms and wake up with throbbing heads and sour breath . Late in squirrel season , he would go out into the deep woods , when the leaves were gone from the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spot on the foundation of the old mill and he would write his name there with a can of spray paint , the first graffiti in this part of the Ozark wilderness . The next winter , he would go back and find other names and empty beer cans . That spring , China would invade Vietnam , and Uganda would fall , and in the next county an old man in a mobile home would die in a tornado . In the same season , he would engage , for the first time , in sexual intercourse with the Indian girl . He would tell her he loved her . He would separate from his wife and son , and he would find out , soon after , that nineteen-year-old women are fickle children . All this would happen Later . But now , in the break room , at the table where he sat alone , he was almost peaceful . He finished his sandwich and put in his earplugs and went back to Screw Machine . He fed in the rods , and the noise began , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could hear nothing , no voices , no strange words or thoughts from a book , no shouts , dangerous and appealing , no cries from the gondola , no beckoning or warning from the copper balloons , and nothing on earth , or outside it , seemed special this day to Toby McNaughton. ?
