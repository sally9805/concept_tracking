The Presidency <P> Before the great campaign of ' 84 is handed over to the history professors , one of its unfortunate side effects bears a glance or two . Besides marking Ronald Reagan 's return to the White House , this year will be remembered for the way a sizable segment of the pundits , academics and campaign theorists turned against the American electorate . <P> There was the expected debunking of the Republican candidate in Cambridge and New Haven , in the newsrooms of the big liberal papers , in the salons of trendy Georgetown . But what startled in the final weeks was the paroxysm of complaint against the voters , who , despite all the entreaties from these learned folks , made up their minds in impressive numbers to back President Reagan . For years these same voters had been praised and pumped up by overpaid TV commentators and underpaid instructors of political science as the most informed and best-educated and therefore the wisest electorate in the world . This year 's affection for Reagan , however , brought bitter second thoughts among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Haynes Johnson , normally an evenhanded fellow .

That tradition was maintained in this election with the Washington Post and New York Times endorsing Mondale , the network commentators gamely trying to disguise their preference for Mondale and Ivy League students expressing their Democratic leanings in campus polls . For years the presumption of liberal Democrats has been that the thinkers and the workers had much in common , namely great political wisdom and , more times than not , winning candidates . <P> But now , the opinion molders and political strategists who have been so influential for so long are obviously at odds with ordinary people . The Democratic Party 's frustration with its rank and file was evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midwest and West and became almost accusatory in her professed bafflement over why they preferred Reagan . Ferraro 's tone suggested that she viewed her listeners as hapless innocents beguiled by a pitchman into breaking their longstanding contract with the Democrats . Ferraro had discovered the world beyond the Hudson and Potomac rivers .
