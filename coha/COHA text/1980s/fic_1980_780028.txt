 |p600  wide , his hooded eyes inscrutable , his beard framing his massive face . He was holding court for whoever chanced to pass by . Rhodes stopped the carriage a respectful distance from the cottage . He 's a difficult man , Frank . You go and prepare the way . Be courteous . ' When Frank approached the stoep he was astounded at how massive Kruger was and how ugly ; he seemed a cartoonist 's caricature of an illiterate Boer farmer , but when Frank fell in line and had a chance to witness how Kruger handled his complaining burghers , it was obvious that here was a man of tremendous animal magnetism and resolute force . What brings you ? ' the president asked abruptly . Mr. Cecil Rhodes is waiting in the carriage . He asks permission to have words with you , sir . ' Without even looking in the direction of the carriage , Kruger grumbled , This is Nachtmaal . ' I was not aware of that , sir . ' My burghers are . For years they 've known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here has come a hundred and ten miles , have n't you , Schalk ? ' When the man nodded , Kruger said , This day is sacred to the burghers . I might have a few free minutes on Monday . ' On Monday , Mr. Rhodes has other appointments . Ca n't he possibly see you today ? Or tomorrow , perhaps ? ' President Kruger rose from his chair , demonstrating the great dignity he could command when necessary , and in a gracious voice explained : Today is Nachtmaal Saturday . It 's reserved for the burghers . Tomorrow is Sabbath . It 's reserved for the Lord . No matter how important Mr. Rhodes ' problems , they can wait till Monday , and so can he . ' Without thinking , Frank replied in words which imitated Kruger 's urbanity : Mr. Rhodes waits for no man . ' Turning smartly on his heel , he left the stoep . But by the time he reached the waiting carriage , he was alarmed by what he had done and asked Mr. Rhodes , Shall I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . I meant to give that old devil a chance , but I refuse to crawl on my knees . We shall proceed without him . ' Back in his offices , Mr. Rhodes referred so frequently to that obstinate , Bible-quoting Boer ' that Frank speculated on what his response to his humiliation might be . Then he discovered that Mr. Rhodes was making many cautious inquiries on various aspects of Boer strength , for as he told his young gentlemen , A man must never move until he can assess the full power of his opponent . ' Are you spying out the enemy ? ' one of the young fellows asked . I have no enemies , ' Rhodes snapped . Only opponents . The day after we settle our differences we become mutual friends . ' And Frank recollected a dozen instances in which this rule had prevailed . For three years Rhodes had fought Barney Barnato , and when the fight was settled , had welcomed him to his board of directors . Now Rhodes promised : The  |p601  morning after President Kruger agrees to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in governing our joint territories . ' Suddenly , one morning , he wheeled about and fixed Saltwood with his watery eyes , which could become so fiery when he wished . Zimbabwe ! Frank , I 've always wanted to know who built it . I 'm convinced in my own mind it must have been the Queen of Sheba , as the Bible indicates . What I want you to do is organize an expedition to search out the place and report to me what you find . Because we must nail down the truth before some German adventurer proves that the stone castles were built by Kaffirs . Hideous thought . ' Since Frank could not decipher what Mr. Rhodes was up to , he asked , What has this to do with your plans ? ' There 's a man living far east of here , next to the farm they call Vrymeer . They say he went to Zimbabwe as a boy . Saw the turrets close up . I want you to interrogate that man , check his truthfulness . . Rhodes hesitated , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he ? ' Paulus de Groot . ' Frank did not allow his countenance to change , but like a bomb lighting up the night , Mr. Rhodes ' intentions became clear . I 'll go see General de Groot . Sound him out . ' Paulus de Groot was that giant of a man , six feet five , with stooped shoulders and massive red head , who had led one of the charges at Majuba in 188x when the Boers defeated the best troops in the British Empire . He was a man who could enlist the support of other men ; he was also without vanity , for when the great battles ended he returned to his farm , where he was reported to be living in stark simplicity . The Boer rulers in Pretoria begged him to join the government , but he told them , Riding a horse up a hill does n't make a man sagacious . ' And he remained a farmer . What Mr. Rhodes wanted to know was whether General de Groot had the capacity and the fire to resist an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's said to be past sixty , much too old to be leading troops . But he 's also said to be a very active man , good with horses and guns . Find out about him . ' Then you 're not interested in Zimbabwe ? Not really ? ' Mr. Rhodes changed his attitude completely . Grasping Saltwood by the shoulder , he said quietly , Frank , I 'm interested in everything . I want to pursue everything . You 're off to Zimbabwe in the morning . By way of Vrymeer . ' It was this variety of interests which almost destroyed the pleasant relationship between Mr. Rhodes and Frank , because that night a cable from London reached South Africa , informing Rhodes that a business friend of some importance was sending his niece on vacation to Cape Town and using her to deliver a packet of documents that he wanted Rhodes to  |p602  study . Someone must meet the young woman , Maud Turner , not only to receive the documents , but also to see that she was properly ensconced . No one knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there was a strong suspicion that she must be rather unattractive , else why would her uncle be sending her to Cape Town ? Through the years English families had developed the pleasant and prudent habit of managing by one device or another to ship their unmarriageable females either to India or to Australia , on the principle that ' if she ca n't get married out where the competition is so thin , she 'll never make it . ' This trickle of gaunt , unlovely creatures was regularly dispatche. to the far colonies in hopes that most would never return , or at least , n. till they had sons of a proper age for Eton or Harrow . You must attend her , Frank , ' Rhodes said peremptorily . But I 'm heading for Zimbabwe . ' It can wait . It 's been waiting three thousand years . ' So Frank Saltwood , now in his thirties , clean and trim , with the affe. tations of an Oxford education , boarded the smoky train at Kimberley an . headed south over the empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start that this could be a much more dangero mission than going north to Zimbabwe , because of the inviolate rule th. governed Mr. Rhodes ' young gentlemen : once a man displayed serious in terest in a young woman , he was quarantined from decisions of impo tance , and if he actually married her , he could be fired that day . Indee . Frank wondered if Mr. Rhodes ' choice of him to attend Miss Turner ha . not been some kind of signal that his days in diamonds and gold wernearing an end . Because he enjoyed his work and wanted to continue i he was determined to handle the young lady with aloofness , accept he documents , sign her into the Mount Nelson , and hurry back to Kimberle and his more important work . He certainly would not risk employmen he 'd liked for so many years by becoming entangled with a woman . He had not counted on the duplicity of his Salisbury cousin , Sir Victor Saltwood , who had ascertained that young Frank was still without a wife or prospects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turner 's uncle , proposing that his charming , gifted niece , twenty-three years old , be dispatched to Cape Town with papers for Cecil Rhodes , and it was he who , drafted the cable which Rhodes received . Families of importance saw to it that their young men and women met marriageable people of their own kind , and if girls had to ship all the way to Australia or Cape Town , so be it . Sir Victor could not have devised that Frank himself should meet the ship , but he certainly expected him to meet Miss Turner sooner rather than later . He had a right to expect favorable results , for he had sent one of the finest young women of the Salisbury district , member of a strong family , heiress to a modest fortune , and recipient of one of the most practical educations possible : she had been allowed to listen to the lively conversation of her elders , who were interested in politics , morals , business and empire .  |p603  She was reasonably pretty , unreasonably clever with her tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Town was irresistibly attractive as something to do before settling down in Salisbury . She half suspected that Sir Victor and her uncle were conspiring in some way to get her to meet this or that young man ; they were always conspiring about bills in Parliament or reforms in the church , but this did not mean that she had to accede to their rough-and-ready stratagems . She would deliver the papers , go on an elephant hunt , and return to England to marry whom she pleased . In performing these duties she would see as much of South Africa as possible , and have a rattling good time doing so . At the end of the voyage out she could have married any one of three quite ordinary men who had courted her , and she felt confident that on the voyage home she could do better , so she was in no hurry to accept whomever it was that her uncle had selected for her , but when she saw on the dock awaiting her a young man of obvious charm and vitality , she was interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout . Are you Mr. Rhodes ' emissary ? ' I am . Saltwood 's the name . ' Meet me over there , Saltwood , ' and without assistance from the pursers she found the gangway and was one of the first off the ship . Frank , watching her come skipping down the sloping stairs , saw at once what a remarkable young woman she was . She seemed all of a piece , ' he wrote to his mother . From her buttoned shoes to the sway of her skirt , from the broad cloth belt about her waist to the perfection of her blouse , she was a harmony , but what I liked most was the way she coiled her hair . No man could have deciphered just how she did it , all auburn and glowing in the sunlight . ' Still , he might have resisted her allure had it not been for the added seductiveness of the Mount Nelson Hotel . This fine edifice stood at the edge of the gardens laid out by Jan van Riebeeck two hundred and forty years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacious inn with lovely grounds , ornate hallways , excellent kitchens and muted servants who seemed to be either Malay or Coloured . A chilled Trianon wine from the Van Doom vineyards , a small helping of a spicy bobotie , followed by roast duiker and an orange souffle at the Mount Nelson might addle any young man 's good judgment , but when a lively young woman like Maud Turner sat sharing it and throwing her witty barbs , it became a Lucullan feast . Ile telegraphed Mr. Rhodes : BUSINESS COMPLICATIONS NECESSITATE THREE MORE DAYS . During these three days he was captivated by the levels of interest and understanding she displayed , and he found that she was honestly all of a piece , ' as he had written , a beautifully organized person whose individuality matched her intelligence . In curious ways she resembled Mr. Rhodes , for absolutely everything interested her : How will the blacks ever learn if there are n't enough schools for them ? ' She developed a spe-  |p604  cial affinity for the Cape Afrikaners and sought them out . How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known so few of them ? They 're far more interesting than your English friends . . . What , for heaven 's sake , have you been doing all this time ? ' Working with Mr. Rhodes . ' What I mean , Saltwood . The English in South Africa . Another decade , you 'll have been here a century , and what have you achieved ? You 've driven the Boers to set up their own republics . And the ones left behind here in the Cape are talking about an Afrikaner Bond , or something . What have you English got to show ? ' Frank laughed . ' My dear Maud , almost everything you 've seen has been the result of English effort . The port you entered . The railroad you took to Stellenbosch . The passes over the mountains . The schools , the hospitals , the free press . All English-inspired . ' It may be as you say , ' she conceded , inwardly proud of the accomplishments he kept rattling off . But the Afrikaners I met at the coffeehouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Nor did they ever recognize what Hilary was trying to do . ' ' Your granduncle , was it ? The missionary with the . . ' Black woman ? ' ' I did n't mean to say it that way , Frank . ' ' I understand . But do n't be surprised if you live to believe that what Hilary tried to do was right . That he saw the salvation of this land . ' ' Do you think of this as your land ? The way the Boers say they do ? ' ' I was born here . I 've made it my home , even if your Afrikaner friends wo n't acknowledge my joint ownership . Just because they were here first , does n't mean that God gave them the land in some kind of deal . That 's what the Boers up north preach , but mark my words , the English progress they despise will catch up with them . Perhaps very soon . ' ' You 're getting too serious , Frank Saltwood . Tell me about elephant , . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did want to go on an elephant hunt , and if that proved impractical , a lion would do . When he informed her that both animals had quit these parts generations ago , she said simply , ' Then let 's go after them . I have a small allowance , but I think it might suffice . ' When he disappointed her by saying that he could not remove himself from Kimberley , she said , ' Good , I 've always wanted to see how they dig for diamonds . Silly stones  --  would n't want one myself . ' He pointed out that it would be quite improper for her to journey to Kimberley either with him or by herself , but she snapped , Nonsense ! I carry with me letters to the most respectable families on the diamond fields . ' And she organized the delivery of her two trunks to the railway and the purchase of her sleeping compartment to Kimberley . Frank was free to tag along , if he so wished . The journey north was as pleasing as any he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be . She was neither flirtatious nor  |p605  y ; whenever an interesting topic arose , her expressive face revealed ctty much what she was thinking ; and she sought out people for aniated discussion . In the dining car , on the first evening , she invited an der couple to join them . With charming frankness she explained that e was not married to Frank , then went on to say that he was an impornt part of the diamond industry . From them she elicited the fact that cy had a nephew working the gold fields and that he believed there was , ed , in the new town of Johannesburg , for a tailor . Normally they could of have afforded first-class accommodations on the train , but he had sent much money that they had decided to splurge . Are you Jewish ? ' Maud asked abruptly . ' Yes . From Germany , our fathers , years ago . ' Would you ever consider returning to Germany ? ' ' No . That happens to other people , not us . ' ' Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ? ' ' Germany will try to take everything , ' they said . On the second day she invited an Australian couple to dine with them , d again she explained that she was not married to Frank , whereupon wife asked , ' Is n't it a mite risky ? I mean , traveling with a young man ? ' ' Not if he 's a nice young man , like Frank . ' But as she patted his hand c added , ' Of course , he 's not so young , really . How old are you , Frank ? ' ' Past thirty , ' he said . ' Time to be taking the plunge , ' the man said , at which Frank blushed controllably . ' He 'll do the right thing at the right time , ' Maud said . With you ? ' the Australian woman asked . ' Goodness , we hardly know each other . ' And by the time the train ched Kimberley , all the passengers knew that this fine-looking young man was traveling with a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the couple and realized that young Saltd had better be dispatched at once , or he was going to fall into irreible error , so once the introductions were made , he said , ' Saltwood , r conveyances are waiting . You 'd better be off . . . this afternoon . ' ' I shall leave day after tomorrow , ' Frank said with some force , and that s the beginning of the estrangement , for Mr. Rhodes realized with disy that one of his young gentlemen had got himself seriously mixed up th a woman . In the time he had stolen for himself , Frank demonstrated attractively deep feelings for Miss Turner . He deposited her trunks at the local el , then escorted her about the town , showing her the mighty hole in earth where he had worked , and the donkey engines which kept the ter out . He took her into the countryside and to the local church , and the second day ended he asked , ' Are you promised to anyone ? ' When said , ' I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free till I return Zimbabwe ? ' ' And where 's that ? ' she parried . When he told her , she wanted to ac-  |p606  company him on the safari , but this suggestion he rejected forcibly . I derstand , ' she teased . Mr. Rhodes would n't like it . ' Conditions are far too rough , Maud . ' ' I understand . Mr. Rhodes lays down very strict conditions for his e ployees . No women . ' She expected him to say something , and when did n't , she said boldly , But if I did wait , would n't Mr. Rhodes dischar you ? ' Yes . So when I married you , I 'd have to find other employment . ' Could you do so ? ' I 'm a young man . I can work . I know diamonds and gold . ' Very quietly she said , ' I shall cancel my steamship . ' What will you do ? ' I am going on an elephant shoot . ' With whom ? ' he asked in amazement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Maud ! ' I said I would wait , Frank . I did n't say I was going to sit on hands . ' But . . . but , three men from the hotel ! ' My uncle sent letters to two of them . ' And then she kissed him , not peck on the cheek , but the full passionate kiss of a liberated young worn who had found the kind of man she was willing to wait for . From Pretoria , Frank took the new train leading down to Lourenco M ques on Delagoa Bay , but after a full day 's journey he disembarked at t small station of Waterval-Boven , where a wagon awaited him . It was fifteen-mile drive south , with a black man who gave his name as Mic Nxumalo . The first part came from the Bible , he explained in broke English , the second part from his grandfather , who had come here fro Zululand in the time of troubles . Did Mr. van Doom own the land then ? ' No . It was our land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' The word was too big f Micah and he asked what it meant . Get . How did he get the land ? ' A puzzled look came over the black man 's face and he said , At first was ours , then after a while it was his . ' When they reached the town of Venloo , Frank expected to be dropp at a lodging place before visiting Vrymeer , but Micah informed him th he was to room at the lake . With whom ? ' Saltwood asked . The Groots or the Van Doorns ? ' Nobody stays with the De Groots , ' Micah explained . They have onl a very small place . ' And when the horses climbed to the top of the ri that separated Venloo from the lake , Frank understood , for to the non stood a mean collection of wattle-and-daub structures in the center o unkempt fields , while to the east unfolded a substantial farm with an in  |p607  besting mixture of barns for animals , kraals for holding areas , a rambling rhitewashed farmhouse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of rondavels for the Nxumalos and the other blacks Iho worked the land . The farm was obviously prosperous and looked inviting , but what capd Saltwood 's eye was the inconsequential little stream that debouched m the hills , ran among the farm buildings and broadened out to a beau1 lake on which ducks abounded and flamingos . What Saltwood could see , approaching by this road , were the two rounded mountains that ve the site distinction ; as they came slowly into view , Micah pointed m out and said , ' Sannie 's Tits . ' Who 's Sannie ? ' ' Girl that used to live here . My father 's time . She loved a young man . e died . She died . ' The little northern dwellings were occupied by General de Groot , the g farm by the Van Dooms , and it was to the latter that Micah led the rses . ' Hello , there ! ' a rough voice called from the barn . You that Mr. ( bodes ' man ? ' The English words came uneasily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' We do n't hold much with that Mr. Rhodes . He 's a bad one . But u 're welcome . ' The farmer held out a big hand and said , ' Jakob van Doom . Mama ! ' From the house emerged not an older woman but three of the prettiest the girls Frank had ever seen . With a bang they burst onto the edge of e stoep  --  and then behaved quite differently . The oldest girl , about ( teen , stopped shyly when she saw the strange man and stood by a pillar , er blond pigtails reflecting the light . The two younger ones , who seemed be about the same age , seven or eight , were not abashed by the stranger ; hey came rushing right down into the yard to embrace him , their pigtails ying . ' The twins ! ' Jakob said proudly . ' Anna and Sannah , but which is - hich you 'll never know . ' The girls did not try to be cute or tease about their names . They simly took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where through e front door appeared Mevrou van Doom , in her late thirties , holding n infant on her hip . ' This is my wife , Sara , and the ruler of our roost , litDetlev . ' With delighted tugging , the twins carried their baby brother about the oep . ' Come in , ' Mevrou van Doorn said . We wondered about your tele- ' Yes , I came to see the general . I understand he went to Zimbabwe ace . ' He was there . But only as a little boy . ' ' Will he remember ? ' ' The general remembers everything , ' Mevrou van Doorn replied .  |p608  My father was there , too , ' Van Doorn said . He led a party north of the Limpopo . Tsetse fly drove them back . ' Will I run into the tsetse up there ? ' You will . ' The Van Doorns took him into their house and showed him where he would sleep . As the twins helped him unpack , their mother made coffee and rusks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white lightning ) , a fiery homemade brandy . We drink to your coming . Do you speak Dutch ? ' Alas , not much . I was brought up in the Grahamstown area , yo know , where there were few Boers . ' And before they could respond , h added , Our family bought De Kraal , you know . ' You did ! ' Mevrou van Doom cried . Vaguely the family had kno that trustworthy English settlers had purchased the farm , but their nam had been lost . Are you the family that collected the money from London for my f ther 's slaves ? ' Van Doorn asked . Yes . I 've heard that story . ' Frank shook his head in disgust . What bad thing the London government did to you people on the slave deal . ' What do you mean , deal ? ' Van Doom asked . The cheap way the slaves were paid for . Or not paid for . ' That was a bad time , ' Van Doorn said , but then he added brightl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose ? ' When Frank no ? ded , he cried , Come along , children , ' and led a procession around th end of the lake . Saltwood was totally unprepared for the primitive conditions in whic. this great general , a hero of the Boer republics , lived . But when De Gro. came forward to extend a rough welcome , any thought of meanness or pri vation vanished . The man was a giant , but hunched over like some moun tain denizen in a German fairy story . When he gripped Saltwood by thshoulder , his fingers were like steel . Then he laughed heartily and said , I want you to meet my wife , ' an . from the rude hut came a handsome woman in her sixties , erect , whithaired , blue-eyed . As a girl she must have been beautiful , and even no her dignity was striking . This is Mevrou de Groot , ' the general said , an . as he spoke he took her hand , and they stood facing their visitor . But then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Groo bent down to embrace the twins while the general bowed gallantly t . Johanna . At this point Jakob said , This is Frank Saltwood . It was hi grandfather who got us the payment for our slaves . He took our warrants , sent them to London , and got us every penny to which we were entitled . Not all that we should have had , but all that was allowed us . ' With a great slap of his hand on Frank 's leg , De Groot said , I remember the day at Thaba Nchu . A smous came up from Graaff-Reinet with two packets . One for Van Doom , one for my father . But my father had been killed by Mzilikazi . So the packet was given to me , and I can remember tearing it open and seeing the new bills , English bills , and I  |p609  d n't like them . And do you know what I did with that money , young ? ' Frank said , ' I ca n't guess , ' and the old general said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved it , and in 1881 , when we fought the English at Majuba , spent it all to outfit my own commando . English money fighting English ldiers . I liked that . ' Was the fighting hard  --  at Majuba ? ' Fighting is always hard , especially against you English . Your officers re stupid but your men are heroic . ' Were you in command of the Boer forces ? ' Before the old man could spond , Frank added , ' I mean , they speak of you as one of the heroes of Majuba . ' With a big forefinger De Groot poked at his guest . ' No one is ever in command of Boers . Each man is his own general . ' But everyone speaks of you as the general . ' ' Yes . I raised the commando . And at night I asked if this or that approach might not be best . But if I ever gave an order , someone would have asked , " And who in hell are you ? " And that , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a very .. : He fumbled for a word and asked Van Doom for help , using Dutch . ' Relevant , ' Van Doorn suggested . ' Yes , that would be a relevant question . " Who in hell are you to give rders ? " ' ' How did you fight the battle ? ' ' Our Bible tells us that one Boer can defeat one thousand Canaanites . So we did it , that 's how . ' ' I do n't remember any mention of Boers in my Bible , ' Frank said , to which De Groot replied , ' That 's your Bible . ' For nine days Frank studied these two families , and as he watched them in action he concluded that people like these would never conform to Mr. Rhodes ' plans for them . When his departure neared , the Van oorns announced that the De Groots would come over for a farewell upper with a surprise at the end , and Frank was perched on the stoep , trying to guess which little girl was Anna and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes Ouma ! ' and Frank looked across the lake to the De Groots approaching . They came in an old cart pulled by one tired horse . General Paulus sat front , the great bearded patriarch usurping the entire seat , while Sybilla t deferentially behind , a big woman crammed into a little space . She sat of on a seat , but in the well of the cart on a pile of animal skins , and Saltwood had to suppress a grin , for she resembled a Queen Victoria of the veld , regal and rugged and triumphant . When he went to the cart , this impression was reinforced , for she said quietly , ' How pleased we are to be with you again , ' and he would have helped her down except that General de Groot calmly intruded , extending his hands as if it was his privilege , and his alone , to help this woman .  |p610  It was a substantial supper , one of Mevrou van Doom 's massive offerings of lamb stew , and as it ended , each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , began to show excitement , which reached a peak when Jakob went into the kitchen , reappearing with a brown-gold pot over whose rim showed a crusty pudding marked with citron , cherries and raisins . Bread pudding , style of Van Doom , ' Johanna cried , and when Frank tasted it he complimented Mevrou van Doom . Not me ! My man ! ' And she nodded at her husband , reverently touching the old ceramic pot as she did . Yes , in our family the men make the pudding , ' Jakob said . This pot , 168o maybe . Made in China , no doubt . Came over the mountains . Two farms were burned with it on the shelf . You ever hear of Blaauwkrantz ? Well , it went through fire there , too . ' We 're an old people , ' General do Groot said . We 've been here a long time . ' After the meal the family grew quiet , and Van Doom produced a Bible even older than the crock . Amsterdam , I think . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he prayed with his hand on the book . Frank , who was paying close attention , began to suspect that these two families were trying to warn him about something , and his feeling was confirmed when the old general spoke : ' We were here more than a hundred and fifty years before you came , Saltwood . More than two hundred before Rhodes . We would not like interruptions . ' Combing his heavy beard with his fingers , he stared right at the young Englishman , never for a moment conceding that Frank might be just as much a part of Africa as he . On the last day Frank asked Jakob for a free space at the table , and there , with the twins looking over his shoulder , he wrote a long report to his employer , the crucial paragraph being this : One can not talk with these men without becoming convinced that they would again take up arms in a minute if they thought their freedom was endangered . Van Doorn is probably in his fifties , but he would ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his sixties , and I suppose he would not actually go into battle , but I am sure he would lend every support . One night we rode into the little town of Venloo , where we met with another forty Boers who said specifically they were at all times ready to mount a commando on one hour 's notice . I must therefore caution you doubly and trebly not to allow any of your associates to launch unwarranted or headstrong adventures . I would hate to see the rabble of the gold reef go up against these rocklike men , who would be fighting for their independence . I can hear you telling the others : Young Frank is frightened . ' That would not be correct , because I am terrified . I am terrified that an imprudent or hasty action might bring disaster upon us all . I assure you that Paulus de Groot alone could take on eleven Australian and American floaters who have no concern with  |p611  the land except to bleed it , and I suspect he could handle five or six Englishmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Groot was there more than fifty years ago , but he says he can still see every wall , every edifice . I wish he were on our side . By the accidents of history , Frank Saltwood was about to traverse in 1895 the route that young Nxumalo had taken in 1457 . He left Vrymeer and headed for the Limpopo , near whose banks the copper mine still flourished . Once more high water impeded the crossing , and when the north bank was reached , the baobab trees exerted their magic . I was quite unprepared for them , ' he wrote his mother . Trees which seemed to be planted upside down by some mysterious force , their uplifted roots filled with birds . On two occasions we have slept inside the trees . ' Like Nxumalo , he came upon the great slabs of granite , their layers exfoliated into perfect building blocks , but unlike him , he did not have to carry samples to the king . In proper time he reached the hills from which the ancient city became visible , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kind , physical or historical , just what it was this strange , lost city represented . Lacking all prejudice , he studied the ruins from afar and saw that they were long overgrown with trees and climbing vines , that they must once have been imposing but were now in poor condition , and that nothing in their sad , majestic profile betrayed their origin . He descended into a valley leading to the ruins , and came after a while to an impoverished group of blacks led by a Chief Mugabe , who could speak neither the Zulu nor the Sotho language of the bearers , but after a while one was found who had once drifted down to the diamond mines , and he could speak a kind of lingua franca . Zimbabwe ? ' He knew nothing of it . Who rules now ? ' No one , but Chief Mugabe had his kraal on the side of the hill on which the citadel rested . Who built the towers ? ' That had often been discussed . Can we inspect it ? ' Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - uncovering not a single clue which would indicate origins . The pictures in the Bible his parents had given him on his twenty-first birthday came to mind , but they looked nothing like this . However , suppose that all those pictures had been of Jewish structures ? Could not these ruins have been those of the Queen of Sheba , who would have built in a different manner ? Or of the Phoenicians , who would have had their own style ? And what authority did the pictures in the Bible have ? Were they not merely some artist 's imagina-tion ? Whenever he pursued such thoughts , he stopped before reaching a logical conclusion , because he had to keep in mind the fact that his employer , Mr. Rhodes , desperately wanted these buildings to be the ancient  |p612  Ophir , not because that would prove the Bible to have been accurate , but for a much subtler reason : to justify his own wrongdoing . When he got nowhere with President Kruger in his plan to have a joint English-Boer occupation of the lands north of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own pioneer column deep into Matabeleland , where Mzilikazi 's son was overrun . When resistance developed , he dispatched a private army to crush it , then annexed the entire area . Even at this moment , grateful imperialists in London were proposing that this new British colony be called Rhodesia . So now , if Rhodes could prove that no black society had ever been advanced enough to have built Zimbabwe , his theft of Matabeleland would seem more palatable . It would , after all , be rather ugly to have stolen a kingdom in order to bring it civilization if that kingdom had once been civilized . Frank Saltwood was thus obligated to prove that Zimbabwe had been built far back , in the time of the Old Testament , and during his last three days on the site he remained in his tent , drafting another report to Mr. Rhodes : Every indication at Zimbabwe proves that it was of Phoenician origin . The grand design , the shape of the tower , the construction of the high citadel , the way the now-vanished huts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of the stonemasons , combine to demonstrate a Mediterranean provenance . I could not find a shred of evidence that would support the claims of some that these walls had been erected by primitive black men , and to so argue seems preposterous . I put these structures at the late Phoenician period , which means that they could well have been erected by artisans of that nation imported here by the Queen of Sheba in the days when King Solomon ruled in Jerusalem . Since there is strong and viable record of much gold coming from Zimbabwe , I think we can state with certainty that this is Ophir of the Bible and that from it Sheba obtained the gold she took with her on her journey to meet Solomon . The matter is closed . But when the wagons were packed , and the last photograph taken , and the antelope shot for the food supply , Frank returned to the ruins alone , sickened by the shameful thing he had done , this profanation of everything he had learned at Oriel : A man must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his preconceptions , he must change his preconceptions , not the facts . ' What have I done ? he asked himself as he studied the silent stones whose messages were crying out to be understood . Have I debased myself to curry favor with an irascible man who perverts everything to his own purpose ?  |p613  Cautiously he climbed a platform next to the tower to inspect once more the stonework , which now seemed so primitive , so unlike anything the Phoenicians or the Jews of Solomon 's time might have done . After all , the basic stonework of Rome was being laid down in that age , and Greek masons already knew the major principles . Men trained in those schools could never have built these edifices . But he found no proof of anything until the final moments , when he had left the tower and was standing at a point where two walls abutted , and he saw with amazement that the stones were not interlocked , as they would have been in any Mediterranean building : that is , the stones of the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones of the wall running north and south , making each wall stronger . In crude fashion , one wall merely leaned against the other , acquiring only such added strength as proximity provided , and it occurred to him that masons had not used that childish device in Rome or Greece or Phoenicia or the Holy Land or Persia or Arabia for the past four thousand years . My God ! ' he whispered . They 're right . These buildings were erected by black men who never heard of Ophir or the Queen of Sheba , ' and he ran to all the corners where walls abutted , and in every instance one wall merely leaned against the other . With this knowledge , he hastened to the foot of the steep hill on which the citadel rested , and , though exhausted , ran up , breathing furiously until he reached the lonely top where the goldsmiths had worked and the great Mhondoro conversed with spirits . And there , too , the walls leaned one upon the other , and the stonework was primitive , with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been built by the ancestors of the Xhosa and the Zulu . The nonsense about the Queen of Sheba was a fatuous dream generated by men who had never seen the stones , and kept alive by fancifiers who loved the idea of ancient royalty and despised the actuality of black builders . As he was about to leave the citadel he saw , partly hidden by the rubble , something he had missed on his earlier explorations : a beautifully carved narrow stone about six feet high , its bottom squared off for fitting into a socket , its top an intriguing bird , something like a falcon , something like an eagle . In not a single line did it betray Mediterranean influence ; this was an artwork of black men , and when he called for servants to carry it down the hill for delivery to Mr. Rhodes , he thought : I have been forced to write that Zimbabwe is Phoenician , but this bird will proclaim the truth . Back in his tent as it was about to be folded , he looked at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was restrained by the fact that Mr. Rhodes would like it in its present form and would be most distressed if he , Frank , modified it in accordance with his final discovery : I know what the truth is . Does what Mr. Rhodes thinks do any harm ? And he carefully filed the papers that would set the intellectual patterns for the next eighty years . Zimbabwe had been stolen from the blacks . '  |p614  When he neared civilization he began to hear rumors of turmoil , but exactly what caused them he could not ascertain . Black members of his safari spoke of a battle , but the white members could make nothing of this until a terrified English miner , obviously running for his life , intercepted them with the shocking news that Mr. Rhodes had shortly before declared war on the Boer republics . His ragtag army , led by the mercurial Dr. Leander Starr Jameson , had tried to take over the government but had been roundly defeated . Anxiously , Frank interrogated the fugitive , who gave confirming details : Mr. Rhodes had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the consequences had been the disaster he had predicted . When the safari reached Pretoria it was approached by an armed Boer commando whose leader shouted in English , You have a man named Saltwood ? ' and when Frank stepped forward , three Boers pinioned him , took his papers , and carted him off to jail . What 's the charge ? ' Frank protested . You 'll hear . Just before they hang you . ' He was thrown into a cell that contained an Australian member of Mr. Rhodes ' revolutionary force , two Englishmen and a breezy , even-ternpered American mining engineer named John Hays Hammond , who had helped organize the ridiculous affair . What happened ? ' Frank asked . Very simple , ' Hammond explained . We had five hundred handpicked men under Dr. Jameson , many more waiting in Johannesburg , but with no communication between them . We marched forth to capture the country , but suddenly Boer horsemen appeared from everywhere , led by this great whiskered brute of a man , General de Groot , riding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boys , put down your guns . " So our men put them down , and here we are  --  in jail . ' You mean De Groot defeated your whole army ? ' Have you ever seen De Groot ? ' ' I have . They call him the Hero of Majuba . ' He 's a formidable man , ' Hammond said . But what am I doing here ? ' Frank asked . ' I was north of the Limpopo when this happened . ' None of the prisoners , cell after cell of Uitlanders , who had called themselves Reformers , could explain why Saltwood had been arrested , but after days in the crowded jail he heard enough from the conspirators to assure himself that they were indeed guilty of insurrection and that the venture had been sorely botched . How could Mr. Rhodes have stumbled into this ? ' he asked repeatedly , and finally the Australian said , ' Because he had contempt for the Boers , like all of us did . ' ' After what I wrote him ? ' Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell , all the prisoners looked at him . ' Oh , ' one of the Englishmen said , ' you 're the spy they kept asking about . '  |p615  Spy ? ' Frank repeated . He suddenly realized that his prying visit to General de Groot , his chain of persistent questions and his note-taking could be interpreted as spying . And at the trial , General de Groot and Jakob van Doom both testified , with regret , that he had come to them some months before the raid as a friend , asking a series of probing questions relating to the rebellion . Van I ) oorn in particular could verify that he had written a long report which he admitted he was sending to Cecil Rhodes , and from hints that Van 1 ) oorn picked up , it concerned the military capabilities of the Boers . Did Mr. Saltwood appear at your farm in military uniform ? ' ' No , sir , he came as a spy . ' Did he inform you that he was serving as the agent of a rebellion ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spy . ' When the trial ended , the grim-faced judge placed on his head a small black cloth . One by one the prisoners were brought before him : John Hays Hammond , the court finds you guilty , and for your treasons you will be taken from jail and hanged . ' Frank felt his knees buckling as an ashen-faced Hammond was returned to the jail , and if the Australian had not held him , he might have collapsed . The Australian was sentenced , then the two Englishmen , and now it was Saltwood 's turn , but as he was led into the dock a rude commotion erupted at the rear of the courtroom . Two policemen were trying to restrain an elderly Boer who was struggling with some heavy object . When they led him before the bench , the judge looked down severely : ' Lang-Piet Bezuidenhout , what is this nonsense ? ' Forgive me , your Honor . But I bring something that might help your onor punish these men . ' Lang-Piet , this is a court for justice , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry . ' But , your Honor , the men of my commando have been in the saddle many days to bring you this thing . ' ' What thing ? ' ' Die balk van Slagter 's Nek , Oom Gideon . ' And that was precisely what had happened . Lang-Piet Bezuidenhout and his cronies had ridden down to Graaff-Reinet to buy the wooden beam of the Slagter 's Nek gallows from a family who had preserved the grim relic for some eighty years . ' The rebels must hang from this very beam , ' the old man shouted as his cronies cheered . ' We want justice . ' The judge , Oom Gideon de Beer , said quietly , ' Lang-Piet , in these days we dispense a fairer kind of justice . Sit down and be silent . ' Then he turned his attention to the man waiting in the dock : ' For your crimes you will be taken from jail and hanged . ' In this extremity , Maud Turner came to Frank 's rescue . With bars tcparating her from the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her every detail of what he had done since she had said  |p616  farewell to him at Kimberley . When he explained what he had written in his Vrymeer report to Rhodes , she cried , But that would exonerate you ! ' And when he told her of the Zimbabwe report , which the Boer commando had taken from him , she was exultant : It proves you honestly were doing scientific work . That makes your Vrymeer questionings legitimate . ' But how to get possession of the two documents ? The first was held by Rhodes , who would be further incriminated if its contents were revealed . The second was held by the Boers , who would not likely deliver it . There seemed no way to obtain the papers . With no other recourse , and with the death of her fiance imminent , she took the bold step of going directly to the president of the Boers , and she found him sitting on his stoep , wearing a top hat and making himself available to any complaining citizen . At first he terrified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice that rumbled like a volcano , the flecked beard that rimmed his features , the tight-fitting black frock coat . But after he heard her out , he spoke to her , in English , with a warmth that surprised her . You want me to save the young man 's life ? ' I do ! ' she cried . You sit down here . You say two documents are in existence ? ' They are ! They are ! ' And if I could see them , they would exonerate him ? ' They would , sir . ' Then why do n't you produce them ? ' She took a deep breath . Because Mr. Rhodes has one . And you have the other . And you are both very stubborn men . ' He halted his interrogation and called for his wife to fetch them coffee , and when Mevrou Kruger appeared on the stoep , a heavy , wheezing housewife , she seemed more like a kindly grandmother than the first lady of a republic . Her Coloured servant handed Maud a gaudy cup and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rusks . To her husband , Mevrou Kruger handed a double portion of rusks , then sat beside him with hands folded . You say you are Miss Maud Turner ? ' the president asked . Yes . ' And you planned to marry this young man ? Before he was caught as a spy ? ' He was never a spy , sir . ' But you yourself told me that in his first report he informed Mr. Rhodes of our strength . ' That he did , but if you remember , he also warned Mr. Rhodes against any military adventure . ' Mevrou Kruger broke in : Do you still want to marry him ? ' Before Maud could respond , President Kruger astounded her by breaking into a hearty laugh . My dear young lady ! Do you think we Boers  |p617  t to give the English a motive for revenge , such as they gave us at agter 's Nek ? ' He paused . Have you ever heard of Slagter 's Nek ? ' I 've been there , twice . Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the missionary ? Who tried to halt the hangings ? ' We Boers do not cite missionaries as evidence , ' Kruger said , and again c broke into laughter . Miss Turner , early this afternoon I commuted all e sentences . ' He reached over and patted her knee as Mevrou Kruger Pfered fresh coffee to both her husband and his guest . Yes , ' Kruger said as Maud daubed at her eyes . He 's free , if he can pay is fine . ' How much ? ' Twenty-five thousand pounds . ' She gasped . This was more money than she had ever visualized , a vast fortune really , but she firmed her chin and said , Somehow I 'll get it . ' No need . Mr. Rhodes has already informed us that he 'll pay it . ' Then Frank is free ? ' Yes . ' Her fortitude deserted her . With trembling hands she put the saucers aside and buried her face in her hands . After a few moments Mevrou Kruger came to her side and helped her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she said . My husband likes to talk with pretty women . ' When Mr. Rhodes learned that Frank was determined to marry Miss Turner , he was deeply distressed . The loss of any of his young gentlemen to matrimony was a calamity , but to have Frank leave when he was going to be so sorely needed was intolerable . Summoning Miss Turner to his offices in Kimberley , he put it boldly to her that she was ruining the young fellow 's life by insisting upon marriage . Seems to me , ' she snapped , it 's you who 've done the ruining . ' Do n't be pert , young woman , ' he replied . I did n't land him in jail , ' she retorted , and the debate was on . Rhodes pointed out that if Frank stayed with him he would always have a fine job , at the center of things , helping to decide affairs of great moment , to which she replied , He decided how to get himself hanged . ' I saved him , ' Rhodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that awaited this brilliant chap ' He 's not brilliant , ' she cut in . He 's not even bright , if you ask me , getting involved in your daydreams . ' Ignoring the interruption , Rhodes explained the dismal prospect that would await Frank if he married and lost his job , to which Maud asked , ' Why must he lose his job ? If he does a sensible thing like marrying the woman of his choice ? ' Because no man can work as my personal assistant , and share the dreams I have , and cater to a woman , too . '  |p618  Your dreams , Mr. Rhodes , are addled , and I 'm taking Frank away from you before you turn him crazy , too . ' The threat was easier made than discharged , for when Frank was brought into the discussion , Rhodes pleaded for the young man 's continued help , especially at this time of crisis : You must come with me to London . To help me face down the inquisitors . ' And he made such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he faced as a consequence of the rebellion , that Saltwood once more allowed himself to be entrapped by this man . Maud , I 'll be gone only a short time . He needs me . ' I need you , ' she replied . And if you go , do n't count on my waiting for you forever . ' Maud ! ' It was a cry she did not hear , for she had left the offices , and in her stead Frank had in his hands a sheaf of legal papers which he must study before sailing from Cape Town . Maud 's patience was to be severely tested , for not only did Rhodes keep his hold on Frank during this time , with its involved lawsuits and frenzied meetings , but he dragged him into another set of extensive neg. tiations in an attempt to strengthen his empire . He had exited from h ' troubles with more power and money than before ; he had engaged i criminal acts against both the Boer republics and his own government , bu had emerged almost unscathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cape Colony , but he retained his seat in Parliament permanently . He turned once more to his grand design . The map of Africa must bs painted red ; Rhodesia must be extended in all directions . German infiltra tions must be halted and Belgium watched . He had a thousand schemes , plus a special one which lay entwined with his heart : this he discusses with Saltwood , whom he considered , all things in balance , to have bee the very finest of his eighteen or so young gentlemen . What do you think of it ? ' he asked one morning during their second trip to London as he shoved at Frank a rumpled paper covered with ink scratches . It was the rough outline of a new last will and testament seventh in line  --  explaining his involved plan for a perpetual trust . It would receive millions of pounds , to be doled out to bright young men in the British colonies and America to enable them to attend Oxford and there imbibe the instruction which would encourage them to go forth and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for identifying the perfect man : scholastic achievement ; success in manly sports ; exhibition of moral force and leadership ; and what he called qualities of manhood , ' which included truth , courage , devotion to duty , sympathy for the weak , kindliness , unselfishness and fellowship . Young men who exhibited these qualities were to be handsomely endowed with scholarship funds and given every advantage in gaining a start in life . Well ? ' Rhodes asked impatiently . You establish very high standards , sir . '  |p619  You met them . All my young gentlemen at Kimberley met them . ' When this reference was added , Frank understood what Mr. Rhodes hoped to accomplish with his largesse : he wanted an endless supply of the young men who had served him so well  --  Neville , Richard , Edgar , Elmhirst , Gordon , Mountjoy , Johnny , and so on , through eternity , men with first names only , who did not bother with girls but who stood tall and tended the duties of empire . The list of attributes Mr. Rhodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such men , and there would always be both a need and a place for them . But even as Frank studied this description of himself he had to be amused by one incongruous aspect . What 's funny ? ' Rhodes asked testily . Your criteria , ' Frank said with a chuckle he could not repress . Tapping the paper , he said , Mr. Rhodes , you would n't qualify on a single item . You hate sports and ridicule us when we engage in them . You took nearly a decade to win your degree . You had little sympathy for the Matabele , until they were thrashed . And as for truth , I 've heard you give quite wrong explanations of your acts . Courage you may have , but you were n't in the front line when your revolution took place . And damnit all , you showed no kindliness to Maud . Not only would you fail to win one of your scholarships , you would n't even be considered . ' Laughing heartily , Rhodes reached for his will , waved it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not meant to identify men like me . We who move the world are not pleasant people , but we need pleasant , inoffensive people to help us . These scholarships will uncover such people . ' When Frank started to speak , Rhodes interrupted : Stay with me , most precious of my young gentlemen , and we shall attain the dreams . You 're to administer the scholarships , you know . ' As he started to leave the room he turned back to say , You 're to find me an endless supply of decent chaps just like yourself . ' Handing the will back to Frank , he said , Think about it . ' For some time Frank sat staring at the floor , anticipating the great times he could have in Oxford , administering the scholarships , but this opportunity vanished when two visitors to his hotel room changed everything . The first was his cousin , Sir Victor Saltwood , M.P . for Salisbury . He was brief and harsh : You 've behaved like a damned fool , Frank . I sent you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what in hell do you do but leave her and go off to some pile of rubble in what they call Rhodesia . And when you come back you get yourself nearly hanged . Your life was saved by that girl , and yet you abandoned her . ' Mr. Rhodes needed me . You 've seen what happened in London . ' Needed you , yes , but dictate to you how your life should be lived ? If you had any gumption , you 'd tell him to go to hell , get aboard the next ship , and marry Maud Turner . ' I 'm afraid I 've lost her , Victor . I 've hardly seen her these past years . ' You have n't at all . She understands the pressure you were under .  |p620  After you left her the first time she got herself involved with schools in the farm districts . She 's done a splendid job . Her father tells me she 's visited your folks at De Kraal , loves them , and is prepared to wait till you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Frank , and others want to marry her . She writes me that she 's giving you two months . ' She is ! ' The world seemed to spin back from the abyss of loneliness which Frank had envisioned for himself . He had supposed that Maud was lost and his life was to be an endless extension of the present , but now his cousin was saying that he had been in communication . . . I want to send a cable , ' he cried impulsively , and on the back of Mr. Rhodes ' proposed will he scribbled : Maud . Sailing home immediately . Marry me the day 1 arrive , please , please , and save my life . He was signing it when Mr. Rhodes returned to the room to fetch his will , but before he could reach for it , Frank thrust it at him , his words face up , and said , Sir , I think you should be the first to know . ' Displaying no emotion , the great financier read the proposed cable , smiled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' He summoned a bellhop and asked him to bring the manager of the hotel . When that gentleman arrived , Rhodes said , See that this telegram is filed instanter . And book us two staterooms on the Scot sailing on Friday . ' No , sir , ' Frank said with a firmness that pleased his cousin . I do n't want you arguing with me all the way to Cape Town . My mind 's quite made up , you know . ' Of course it is , and properly so . I wish to he present at the wedding . ' Turning to Sir Victor , he said , The best , 1 think . This boy was the best of the lot . ' Was ? ' Sir Victor repeated . Yes . He wo n't be working with me any more . I had plans for him , but times change , plans change . ' And he accompanied Sir Victor from the room , a bulky , tired man , only forty-six years old , whose weakened heart could not keep pace with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of the Union Line , which operated the mail ships to South Africa . It seemed strange that a man of such high position would be delivering the tickets , even to such a frequent customer as Mr. Rhodes , and Frank said so : I know he travels back and forth at least once a year , but this is most considerate of you . I shall tell him . ' No ! No ! ' the director said in real panic . My meeting with you is highly confidential . ' What is it ? ' Frank asked . The princess . The Polish princess . ' Who ? ' A lady of high rank . Berlin , Warsaw , St. Petersburg . ' What 's she got to do with Mr. Rhodes ? '  |p621  Ah , that 's what we do n't know . ' Nervously he began to unfold an incredible yarn : I do n't know whether it 's a hoax or what . I do n't know hether Mr. Rhodes is in some kind of danger or not . In fact , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me what you think you know . ' The Princess Radziwill-a real princess bearing a distinguished Polish ame  --  for some time she 's been visiting us to talk about a shadowy trip to Cape Town . Says she has interests there . It develops that her interest is Mr. Rhodes . She never buys a ticket . She 's interested only in when Mr. Rhodes is sailing . ' That seems harmless . ' Yes , but yesterday , within fifteen minutes of your ordering the two tickets to Cape Town .. He did the ordering . Did it himself . ' Even more suspicious . Someone in this hotel , or someone in our offices ? someone notified Princess Radziwill . And as I said , within fifteen minutes she was in my office , wanting to know which stateroom he had and demanding the one next to it . ' Now , that does pose problems , ' Frank conceded . Who is this woman ? Young ? Adventurous ? ' Not at all . She is the true Princess Radziwill . Well vetted in the Almanaca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forties maybe , fifties , and looks it . May have been a great beauty once , but too much Polish and Russian cooking . Dark hair , no streaks of gray . Speaks acceptable English , but also French , German and , of course , Polish and Russian . ' Has she any funds ? ' There 's my problem , Mr. Saltwood . I have absolutely nothing to go on , but from years of selling tickets for boat passages , I 'd say the Princess Radziwill conforms in every detail to the typical woman passenger who is going to give us trouble . Why do I say this ? I do n't really know . But that woman has financial problems . ' Is there any chance that I might see her before we sail ? Not talk to her , you understand . Just see her . Because we do n't want a scandal , do we ? ' The managing director thought that he might summon her to the office at three , to confirm her passage , or something like that , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . You would n't approach my door , you understand . Just the outer office , like any ordinary passenger . You could see her as she exits . ' It was arranged , and from a shop across the street from the Union Line offices Frank watched a shortish , attractive , dark-haired woman step out of a cab and walk in to confirm her stateroom . Casually he crossed the street , moved to a counter , and engaged the young male clerk in conversation about a possible passage to Australia . From where he stood , he commanded a fine view of the manager 's office and had a good chance to study the Princess Radziwill of Poland .  |p622  She seemed gracious , well groomed , interested in the details of h. forthcoming voyage . She talked with animation , and whenever he caugh. sight of her face , it seemed quite pleasant . If she was an agent in somconspiracy against his employer , she masked it well . She rose rather sooner than he expected , walked briskly from the inne office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fran Saltwood , ' she said without hesitation . I am Princess Radziwill . And yo are the cousin of my good friend Sir Victor . Liberal party . Salisbury . I blieve we 're to share the Scot together , this Friday . How very congenial With a slight bow she passed on . Both the steamship management and young Saltwood deemed it best to i form Mr. Rhodes of this strange development , and he guffawed at th- t apprehensions . I like grandes dames like that . I talk to them roughly , i troducing more profanity with each turn of the conversation . After while they leave me alone . ' Frank had a premonition that this cavalier treatment might not su. ceed with royalty as determined as the Princess Radziwill , and he board , the Union Line ship with trepidation , which was justified a few hou ? later at the evening meal . He cautioned Mr. Rhodes : We 'll go in lat after she 's chosen her table , ' and they did so , but as they entered the sal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shadows , and sooner had Mr. Rhodes taken his table , one with spare chairs so that might entertain business acquaintances during the long voyage , than Pri cess Radziwill swept into the room , crying in a soft , ladylike voice , ' 0 dear ! Where shall I sit ? ' Ignoring the chief steward , who hurried up to assist her , she let h .. hand fall upon one of the chairs at Rhodes ' table and asked gently , Do : this happen to be vacant ? ' Frank started to say brusquely , It 's taken , ma'am , ' but before he coup complete the sentence Mr. Rhodes said gallantly , but with obvious relu ? tance , It seems to be free , madam , ' at which she seated herself with gre . firmness , indicating that this would be her place for the duration of th voyage . She was an enchanting woman , much younger in spirit than her yea informed on everything and willing to deliver final judgments on political cians , writers , musicians and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stifle her with his routine profanity , she responded with ani mated discussions of her digestive system , her bowel movements an . episodes in her sex life . Very quickly Mr. Rhodes retreated to more casu. conversation . From the first she demonstrated an intense dislike of Frank Saltwood assessing him accurately as a bar to whatever designs she might have o Mr. Rhodes . She scorned any statement he made , ridiculed his Oxfor. ' insularity and lampooned his general deportment . Specifically she want- ?  |p623  to know why he was n't married , and when he tried to counter with questions about her own status , she deflated him with a forthright statement : I am the daughter of a great Polish nobleman , but my father and I have always considered ourselves Russians first , Poles second . I am married to a Radziwill , one of the proudest Polish names , but he has treated me abominably , and I am soon to be divorced from him . I am forty-one years old . ' She intimated that she was also a famous authoress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the other passengers , he found that she was indeed a distinguished writer on political subjects and that she knew everyone in European society . Sensing that he doubted her statement about her writing , she appeared one noontime in the promenade cafe with two of her books , solid affairs dealing with European court life and its political intrigues . When she saw that Frank and , indirectly , Mr. Rhodes were sufficiently impressed , she said casually , You know , of course , that my aunt , Evelina Rzewuska , was the wife and financial salvation of Honore de Balzac : Who was he ? ' asked a young man from Kimberley who had recently been invited to join the Rhodes circle . Oh , my God ! ' she screamed so loudly that people at other tables turned to look . This pleased her , and she appealed to them : This young fool asks me who Honore de Balzac was . It 's like asking an Englishman who William Shakespeare was . ' And with this she launched upon a recitation , with wild gestures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sweet silent thought I summon up remembrance of things past .. When she was halfway through , Frank thought : What can this creature be up to ? At the closing couplet he found out , for with a sudden drop in her voice , she gazed longingly at Mr. Rhodes and whispered : But if the while I think on thee , dear friend , All losses are restored and sorrows end . ' After a few demonstrations like this , Frank was so deflated that she could speak right past him when she wished to address Mr. Rhodes . But if she humbled the younger man , she exalted the older , praising him extravagantly and placing herself in his way whenever she moved on deck . When he sat down on a deck chair , he found that she had acquired the one next to it , and if he sought to rest because of his increasing heart unease , there she was , prepared to argue politics with him . What does that woman want with me ? ' Rhodes asked Frank in some dismay at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to marry you , sir . ' She 's already married . Said so herself . '  |p624  ' But she 's getting a divorce . Said so herself . ' Rhodes caught the mockery in his young friend 's voice and burst into laughter . ' You have only one commission , Frank . Protect me from that woman . ' Saltwood 's first stratagem backfired : We 'll take our meals in your cabin . Let her have the table . ' But before the first meal ended , the princess burst into the cabin , eyes aflutter , to assure herself that ' dear Mr. Rhodes is not suffering . ' Deftly she maneuvered Frank out of the stateroom , fluffed up the pillows , and sat close beside Mr. Rhodes to help him eat his meal . ' Frank ! ' came the anguished cry . ' You said you 'd bring the papers . ' Grabbing anything at hand , Saltwood hurried back into the room , where the beleaguered man said , ' Sit here beside me , ' and the princess was edged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she chided Mr. Rhodes for having been so ungallant , and as she rose to spread a blanket for him she was seized with a mild fainting spell , which threw her gently into his arms . ' Frank ! ' he bellowed , and when Saltwood hurried up , he found his master embracing the inert body of the Polish princess . During the entire voyage this charade continued , for no matter what maneuver the two men devised , the princess knew how to outsmart them , and one evening when persons at the bar said in her hearing , ' I do believe Mr. Rhodes , the woman hater , is having an affair with the princess , ' she smiled . It was when the Scot was one day out of Cape Town that Cecil Rhodes made the second great mistake of his life . In the presence of Frank Saltwood and two guests at his table he said casually to these business friends , ' When we reach the Cape you must visit me at Groote Schuur . ' ' I shall be delighted ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags when a telegram arrived from the Mount Nelson Hotel announcing that the princess would be coming to dinner that night . At the meal , a party for the colony 's political leaders , she assigned herself the seat as mistress of the establishment , and before long , cryptic notices began appearing in the Cape Town newspapers , sent to them anonymously in a woman 's handwriting : The mighty Colossus whose armor has blunted all the arrows of Cupid seems to have been wounded by that sly huntsman , and we understand that wedding bells may soon be sounding , but who the fair partner is to be we can not at this time divulge except to say that she is a titled dignitary much accustomed to the royal circles of Berlin , Warsaw and St. Petersburg . Who was this cyclonic woman who had risked everything on a boat trip to South Africa in pursuit of the world 's richest bachelor ? Princess Radziwill was everything she claimed to be , and one thing more . She was the  |p625  daughter of one of Poland 's noblest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honore de Balzac ; she had written widely popular books ; and she was divorcing her husband , a process that would require many years , But the salient fact was that she was almost penniless . At forty-one , her hectic behavior had caused her expulsion from the courts of Europe , and several nations had denied her reentry . A waspish gossip , she had frittered away a dazzling life until members of her two families , who did have great wealth , wished to see her no more . With her pen she might have made herself a good life with respectable income , but this talent , too , she abused , and her publishers were weary of her broken promises and unfulfilled contracts . Like her talents , her beauty had begun to fade , and she sensed that she had only a few more good years , which she must use to advantage . It was remarkable that at the nadir of her career she should have devised a plan so bold , with risks so tremendous , but one day as she was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her : Why not marry Cecil Rhodes ? Unfree to marry because of her dragging divorce , without funds , with fewer good dresses than ever before in her life , she had nevertheless launched her assault . Now , at Groote Schuur , Rhodes ' fine Cape Dutch mansion that would become the equivalent of South Africa 's White House , she behaved like a first lady and made it clear that she intended assisting Mr. Rhodes in governing the nation . I need help , ' the great man moaned one afternoon . Beg Frank Saltwood to come back . ' In the hectic days when Princess Radziwill was intent on capturing Groote Schuur , Frank was having the tenderest experience of his life . Upon disembarking from Scot and bidding Cecil Rhodes farewell for what he assumed was the last time , since he had been dismissed , he caught a cab and hurried to the Mount Nelson Hotel , where Maud Turner had come to greet him . Ascertaining from the desk clerk where her room was located , he hurried through the stately lobby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudly at her door . Quickly it was opened and quickly he was down on his knees for anyone in the hallway to see : Maud , can you forgive me ? ' Get up , you stupid boy . ' Then you 'll have me ? ' Not if you act like this . ' And with a swift reach of her hand she grabbed his wrist and pulled him into the room , then kicked the door shut with her heel . I am so glad we found each other again , ' she said , and she maneuvered Frank to the bed , telling him , when the impassioned interlude was over , Now , damnit , you 've got to marry me . ' They took the train up through the Karroo , then south to a small siding convenient to De Kraal . It consisted of an iron shed and stock ramp marked by a deeply carved sign erected by Frank 's father : nrni RY . On the  |p626  long journey Maud had discussed seriously the manner in which they should lead their lives : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with him . What kind of work can you do , Frank ? ' I know the business world . Bankers , diamonds , Parliament . ' Could you be a manager of sorts ? ' I think so . But where shall we establish our headquarters ? ' She had been thinking about this for over two years , and every selfish desire urged her to say Cape Town , for she considered this the fairest city she had ever seen , a place incomparably lovely , with its ocean , its mountain , its deep indented bays , its gorgeous wealth of flowers . This was a city she could love , but her business sense warned her that South African industry was bound to center in the north , near the diamonds and the gold , and it was there that a young man could make his way : I think we should work in Johannesburg . ' What a grubby place . Have you ever seen it ? ' Grubby now , but we must think of the future . It 's got to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated , rubbed his nose , and asked tentatively , Could n't we . . . maybe . . . maintain an office also in Cape Town ? ' As if the idea had never occurred to her , she pondered it , tickled him under the chin with her fingernail , and said , Frank , I think that 's a capital idea . ' In the Cape cart sent from De Kraal to meet them at the Hilary siding they devised a rough pattern for their future : a secure farm investment in the countryside ; a business office in Johannesburg to watch over banking , insurance , trading and stocks , which Boers ignored because they had little interest in intricate financial matters ; a political footing in Cape Town to protect one 's holdings ; and a permanent link with home , ' a spot back in England crammed with memories . ' We must never forget our families in Salisbury , ' Maud said . Naturally . What do you have in mind ? ' I 'd like to slip back home as often as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sounds reasonable . ' The decisions reached by Maud and Frank Saltwood represented those of many Englishmen in South Africa at that time . For them , some cathedral town like Salisbury was home , ' Stonehenge their playground , Oxford or Cambridge their natural inheritance . No matter how diligently Frank handled his finances in Johannesburg or his political connivings at Cape Town , he and Maud would always be drawn back to Salisbury , spiritually if not physically ; and whenever an opportunity for a trip to England arose , they would be eager to renew the umbilical tie . The Van Doorns , on the other hand , never returned to Holland . Not one of them would have known his or her way around the canals of Amsterdam ; they rarely knew who was governing the land or what political  |p627  disposition it had . And if they had gone , they would not have understood either the religion or the language . Huguenot descendants were the same : none of the Du Preez family remembered the Oudezijdsvoorburgwal or its significance to their ancestors ; and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began ; nor could they speak French . Both the Dutch Van Dooms and the Huguenot Du Preez were now Afrikaners , and proud to be so . The Saltwoods were Europeans ; the Boers were people of Africa . The Saltwoods would always have a refuge to scurry back to if trouble erupted ; the Boers would not . If a Saltwood behaved moderately well , the English queen might call him back to London for a knighthood , but if a De Groot performed heroically , no royalty in Amsterdam would know of it , much less seek to ennoble him . Prudently the Saltwoods kept one foot in Salisbury ; the Van Dooms kept both feet in Africa and did not even know of any alternative home to escape to . They rose or fell , lived or died according to what happened in Africa , and between these two types of people , the Europeans and the Afrikaners , the gulf would grow wider and wider . Maud paid close attention to the wild rumors coming out of Cape Town regarding Mr. Rhodes and the Polish princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discomfiture : Gossip says he told her she was not welcome at Groote Schuur and warned her to return to Europe . ' As the scandal worsened , Frank was forced to take notice , and he was grieved when the papers reported that the princess had forged Rhodes ' name to bank paper to the extent of L23,000 . Listen to this , Maud . " She seems to have copied his signature from a printed postcard sold in stationery stores . " How bloody preposterous ! ' Who is this woman ? ' Maud asked . The most extraordinary liar I 've ever met , except that everything she ever told me was true . ' He delighted her with a brief sketch of the affair , explaining how the princess had maneuvered herself onto the Scot and into Mr. Rhodes ' astonished arms . Then he became serious : If she claims she has letters which incriminate him , I 'd say she has them . If she claims the financial papers are not forgeries , but were given to her by Rhodes , I 'd hesitate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. : He fumbled for words , then came up with Stupendous : He added that if the charge of forgery had to be ventilated in court , the entire Cape had better prepare itself for a hurricane . Should you offer your assistance , Frank ? ' To whom ? ' To Mr. Rhodes , of course , ' she snapped . But he fired me . ' He broke into laughter and fell into a chair , dragging his wife along with him . As she perched on his lap he said , You know , of course , that he has never in his life allowed a married man to work as his private secretary . You got me discharged , and it was damned well worth it . '  |p628  But if he needs you . . Maud Turner was the first of the famous Saltwood women ; they formed a long line of strong-willed girls who had left secure homes in rural England , bringing with them to South Africa learning , musical ability , skill in drawing and high moral conscience . They accounted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valleys , the libraries , the inadequate colleges , the books of reminiscences which would mean so much to later generations . Even during her stay in Cape Town , Maud Turner had already launched the Lady Anne Barnard Bowls Club , and near De Kraal she was using her own money to restore the ruins of Golan Mission . Women like her looked at their world , rolled up their sleeves , and tried to make it better . Now Maud behaved with characteristic charity . Not forgetting that Mr. Rhodes had denigrated her and delayed her marriage for several years , she nevertheless told Frank , If that sad , confused man needs your help , we must offer it , ' and they had already reached Grahamstown on their way to the Cape when a telegram intercepted them : NEED YOUR HELP . RHODES . When they entered Groote Schuur they found it occupied only by a cadre of male servants and assistants , one of whom said , That woman 's chasing him all the time . He 's run away to Muizenberg . ' At that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Town , the great man had sequestered himself in a small corrugated-roof cottage wedged against tall trees . Viewed from the outside , it seemed to contain a few meager rooms and no amenities ; it was scarcely a proper setting for what was becoming a major tragedy . Maud expected to work in the cottage , providing what comfort she could , but as she walked up the narrow footpath two young men appeared at the door of the cottage , obviously determined to prevent her entrance : No women allowed . ' But he sent a telegram for us , ' and she produced the paper . That meant Frank , not you . Mr. Rhodes would be most distraught if you were to force your way in . ' I never force my way , ' she said quietly , but the men were adamant : No women . ' So she drove back to Cape Town and her husband moved inside . He was shocked . Mr. Rhodes , not yet fifty , sagged in all directions . His jowls were heavy and unshaven ; his mustache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reddish hair was uncombed and matted with sweat ; his arms and legs lay inert ; but it was his eyes that sent the most alarming signals , for they were sodden , lids drooping and pupils unfocused . He behaved like a man in his painful eighties , forlorn and distressed . The bright young men still surrounded him ; they seemed to come in endless supply : Yes , Mr. Rhodes . Yes , Mr. Rhodes . ' But they gave him little sustenance . Is that you , Frank ? '  |p629  ' It is , Mr. Rhodes . What can I do to help ? ' You 've already helped a great deal . See the Phoenician bird in the er ? He watches over me . ' It would be intolerable to tell him now that c stone masterpiece was not Phoenician . Rasping sounds came from the bed . It was Rhodes trying to make an portant statement : Frank , to protect my honor I 've got to defend myself gainst that damned woman . ' There was now no time for courtesies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly that in proper English society a gentleman never rings suit against a lady . ' I 've never given a damn about English society . I 'm not a gentleman . d that princess is certainly no lady . See the attorney-general , Frank , and urge him to file charges . ' Oh , my God ! ' cried one of the young gentlemen . There she is again . ' And everyone in the cottage looked down the path to the roadway , where a woman dressed in stylish black , under an umbrella , walked slowly back and forth , staring at the cottage where the man she had wanted to marry lay dying . Drive her away ! ' Rhodes cried , but the young man said that they had tried this and the police had warned them that she had a right to walk on a public thoroughfare . But not to stare at me ! ' Rhodes wailed . She can walk and she can walk and she can look , ' one of the young fellows said . All we can do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rhodes lay in the cottage planning , while his lawyer and Frank Saltwood helped the attorney-general 's office with their case against this brazen embezzler ; she issued threatening releases to the newspapers and at dusk came down from Cape Town to walk back and forth , menacingly , silently before the cottage . One evening Maud rode out to talk with the princess as she patrolled the roadway . Why do you torment him ? ' Because he has tormented me . He wants to send me to jail . ' Did you forge the seven papers ? ' I have been Mr. Rhodes ' staunchest supporter . He owes me enormous sums . ' Did n't he pay your hotel bill when the Mount Nelson threatened to evict you ? ' Before the princess could respond , she added , And when you accepted the money , did n't you promise that you 'd leave South Africa ? ' I did leave , ' she protested like an insulted innocent , but I came back . ' Princess , what can you hope to achieve by this ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ignore women , or treat them badly they must be taught a lesson . When I 'm through with Cecil Rhodes the entire world will be laughing at him . ' They 're already laughing at you . Have you seen the cartoons ? ' Cartoons are for today , ' she huffed . I am for history . '  |p630  Maud achieved nothing , and when she drove off , the princess was sti stalking back and forth in the shadows , casting a witchlike spell on t. cottage and its inhabitants . Despite all that the two Saltwoods tried to do to bring sanity into th mad affair , the criminal trial moved forward , complicated by civil trials 0 . lesser matters , and the day came when the two protagonists faced ea ? other before a judge sitting with his clerks at Groote Schuur , since Rhod= was too ill to appear in a regular Cape Town court . They met in bitte ness , they testified in bitterness , with Rhodes stating categorically that had never signed any papers on behalf of the princess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bankers and money lenders of Ca . Town , she had done so as a forger . His testimony , ungracious and unforgiving , condemned the woman imprisonment ; her testimony , malicious and biting , condemned him as fool . Worse , it condemned him to death . After appearing before the judge , he retreated to the miserable cottage where Frank ordered a hole knocked in the bedroom wall so that Rhod= could catch the air for which he gasped continuously . If he lay down , could not breathe ; if he sat up , he could not rest . Still the prince ' marched back and forth , keeping her death watch ; knowing that she coul not escape incarceration , she showed no mercy . She would haunt this u. gracious , unforgiving man to his death . Please go away , ' Frank pleaded with her one night . This is my only freedom . ' Have you any money left ? Any at all ? ' I 'm a pauper . I have n't enough to eat . I shall welcome the security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , a princess of the Russi. court . ' She pronounced the word Rrrosshian . He gave her two pounds and told her to go to the Muizenberg Pavi ion and eat , but she continued her vigil . The breath of air Rhodes sought in that dreadfully hot March nev , reached him , and when he felt that death would overtake him before th criminal trial reached a conclusion , he dismissed her from his mind co pletely . Asking for his beloved atlas , he talked with Frank about those po tions of his plans still to be realized : You must make the map red . Loo . how much we 've done so far . ' When his hand fell upon Rhodesia , he looked up almost pitifully an . asked , They never change the name of a country , do they ? ' No , ' Frank said . That will always be Rhodesia . Your monument . ' But then Rhodes ' eyes could not avoid the areas which represented hi . gnawing defeats : South-West Africa had fallen to the Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned Belgians ha . proved their hearts were made of concrete . But worst of all , while Rhodewas suffering torment from the princess , a far greater agony had rage . ' around him , for Boer and Englishman had finally come to fratricidal blows on the South African veld . His unwavering goal , the union of thos  |p631  two groups , seemed more impossible than ever , but his final words to Frank addressed that problem : ' Dear boy , when this war is over , spend your life trying to unite Boer and Englishman . ' When Rhodes died , Frank was in Cape Town giving a deposition in the trial , and when he heard of the death he felt an overwhelming sense of failure : he had tried to protect this great man from his blunders and from this fiasco with the princess , but he had accomplished little . He was told that Rhodes had died just at sunset on 26 March 1902 , forty-nine years old , consumed by the volcanic fires that had driven him . As he died he uttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to do . ' When the Princess Catherine Rzewuska Radziwill heard of Rhodes ' death she was only forty-four , disgraced , penniless , and facing a two-year sentence in one of Cape Town 's worst prisons . She said of Rhodes : I wanted only to help this lonely , miserable man . Had he attended to me , he might have been saved . ' In prison , her first demand was for a book of rules , which she mastered with such diligence that she became a notorious jailhouse lawyer , ' arguing for the rights of all prisoners . Long before her sentence was completed , the warden petitioned the court that she be set free : Whenever I see her coming at me with that book of rules , I am threatened with twitches . ' The conniving princess would not accept freedom unless the government provided her with first-class steamship passage to London , and enough cash to allow her to live in a respectable London hotel for half a year . Since the senior authorities were also developing twitches , they bowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got aboard . To the Afrikaner lawyer who had enthusiastically defended her against the Colossus , they said , Do not give her a penny of the money . Hand it in a sealed envelope to the captain of the ship , to be delivered only when the vessel is far out to sea . ' She wrote more books , thirty in all ; she lectured ; when Prince Radziwill , her husband , finally died , she quickly married a Swedish gentleman whom no one ever saw ; she was condemned by Russia to perpetual exile ; and by some bizarre set of accidents she landed in New York , which she loved . As Princess Radziwill , she became the darling of royalty-hungry Americans and lived off them in various ingenious ways . Never once during her long stay in that country did anyone uncover the fact that she had spent nearly two years in a South African prison as an embezzler . Finally she wrote her autobiography , not one chapter of which was true ; she enchanted new generations of New York society ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat propped up in bed writing long letters to the rulers of Europe advising them how best to prosecute World War II . She signed her pronouncements : Princess Catherine Radziwill  --  and when she died she was surrounded by three American ladies-in-waiting.  |p632  From the throats of a hundred Boers , young and old , fair-faced an . weather-beaten , came a merry song that carried far beyond the grea barn at Vrymeer in which they were celebrating . The melody w. that of an American Civil War song , Just Before the Battle , Mother , ' bu the Afrikaner version , popular in the eighties , had to do with love , no war : When will our marriage be , Gertjie ? Why are you so very quiet ? We 've been betrothed so long , Gertjie ! Now 's the time for us to wed . Come then , Gertjie , for I shall not Be kept any longer on a string . Perhaps you think I can not die , But my years are passing on ! ' The grizzled warrior Paulus de Groot could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tonight , Jakob , ' he shouted to the owner of the barn , there 's many a heart will be lost under the stars of Vrymeer . ' Van Doorn grinned back through a haze of smoke and dust . General de Groot , as all thought of him , was guest of honor at the party , and with good reason , for in this very week back in February 1881 he had stormed Majuba Hill to thrash the English . And now , from fifty miles away and farther , as if it were Nachtmaal , Boers had packed their wagons and gathered up their families for a ride to Vrymeer . The Van Doom women , with Ouma Sybilla de Groot enthroned at  |p633  their kitchen table , had prepared enough food for a commando . An ox was roasted on a spit opposite the barn ; nearby were tables of bredies , vegetables , sweet dishes : tarts , koeldes , pumpkin fritters , konfyts , and Jakob 's contribution , the crock of bread pudding sensibly flanked by two bucketfuls of the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pudding but passed it by in favor of the barrel of peach brandy . It was a day the people of Vrymeer would not forget , and children bounded through the paradise like a troop of frisky baboons . Nothing was more exciting for a dozen robust little Boers than their encounter with the offspring of the Nxumalo family . Together they explored the secrets of Vrymeer , running screaming from the barn to the cave where the Bushmen 's rhinoceros galloped . After a shouting circuit , they ran to the lake , tossed aside their clothes , and jumped in . At nightfall the tallow candles along the walls of the barn were lit , the ant-hill floor gleamed , and a noisy trio of guitar , violin and concertina went to work . Even Ouma Sybilla managed , just once , to step out and do a few turns , not with her husband , who was tending the peach brandy , but with a young man who had his eye on Johanna van Doorn and thought courtesy to the old queen-buffalo would improve his chances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor was continuously crowded , for if the violin grew tired , the guitar and concertina kept going ; and sometimes the squash-box performed alone . Johanna had agonized for some days over what to wear , and her efforts had proved most successful : she had donned a long skirt whose bottom hem was filled with kernels of corn to give it weight and make it flare out when she pirouetted . Watch your millstone , young fellow ! ' De Groot roared suddenly . You 're grinding too rough . ' He meant that the partner swinging Johanna had her dress so nearly parallel to the floor that bits of grain were flying loose . It was past midnight and the concertina played a little more slowly as groups talked quietly or hummed old songs and Jakob mentioned the one sober question of this festive day : How long have our families lived here , Paulus ? ' The general reflected : Fifty-eight years . ' We should be grateful . ' What for ? ' the old warrior asked . Many things , Paulus . Mostly we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the Englishmen from changing us . But with so many Hitlanders moving in ... ' Oom Paul  --  it 's his job to watch the English . If he wants to see you , like the telegram said , it must be important . ' my Generaal ! ' Earlier that week Jakob had been summoned to meet with President Kruger in Pretoria ; he would take the train Monday morning , for he knew that something serious was brewing .  |p634  Jakob found the great man on the stoep , deep wrinkles in his face , a black top hat perched on his head and a tightly buttoned coat covering his enormous belly . He did not rise to greet one of his most trusted burghers but showed his pleasure at the visit . Jakob , there are troubles , there are dangers we must face , ' he said , indicating a chair . The English , Oom Paul ? ' Always the English . They mean to steal our republics , them and the Uitlanders . ' Not while this Van Doorn has a breath . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nice words . ' He spat over the edge of the stoep . I have a task for you , broeder . You have family at the Cape , not so ? Van Dooms of Trianon . I want you to visit them . Hear what they have to say . What 's on their minds if the English take up arms . ' There 's been talk of rebellion down there . Against the English government . ' Ja , ja . But what do the people really think ? ' He rocked back and forth . Talk is n't enough . Where will the Van Doorns , the Du Preez , the Hofmeyrs stand the day we have to fight for our lives ? ' We 'll need them all , ' Jakob said . You are visiting family down there . Understand ? You 're not Oom Paul 's official . Talk with anyone you like , but keep away from government people . We have enough troubles with them already . ' I understand , Oom Paul . ' now that 's good , Jakob . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paulus de Groot . How 's the old devil these days ? ' Jakob was fifty-five years old that February , a man of medium height , heavy build and deliberate movement . He was delighted at the prospect of traveling to the Cape in a first-class carriage and at government expense , for he had never seen the Trianon of his ancestors and looked forward to meeting its occupants . He conducted his interviews in Cape Town first , and was pleased to find that the wealthy Du Preez had not forgotten their links with his family . They were most congenial when recalling those days when the first De Pres shared the Trianon vineyards with the Van Dooms . We 've both moved a long way . ' But when he discovered their attitude toward participation in a possible war , he was unhappy to learn that they had no interest whatever in taking up arms to defend the Boers . Do n't misunderstand us , Van Doom . We have much sympathy for the republics , but not for war . Look at what we have here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize you might not like the Uitlanders as neighbors , but damnit , man , you Boers would n't know how to handle gold . Not even with all the Hollanders and Germans you bring in to run your government . ' Jakob tried to argue that the freedom not only of the northern Boer  |p635  but of the southern Afrikaner , too , would hang in the balance : That is , if war comes . You Cape Afrikaners would certainly ? ' They cut him off : ' We have all the freedom we need here in the Cape . More than you seem to have up north . You may not believe this , but we like it here . We wo n't march in your armies . ' A schoolteacher named Carolus Marais invited Jakob to walk with him to see various Afrikaner establishments in the area : schools , big churches , solid homes built on the slopes of Table Mountain . Our forefathers never did so well under Dutch rule . We elect our people to Parliament , protect ourselves from the Englishmen . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Jakob exploded . But suppose the English force it on us . Surely , if you have any decency or courage , you 'll support the republics . ' Would you ride out in some silly war , at your age ? ' Of course . And the other burghers at Venloo , we 'd ride with our commando if they call us . We 'd lose everything if we did n't . ' Then you 'd be very foolish . You and I can gain everything we want from the English without firing a shot . They have laws , Van Doom . They 're a great people for putting everything down in laws . And when they do , they obey them . ' But always on their own terms . ' Jakob , be sensible ! We Cape Afrikaners are fighting our own war , not with German guns and Boer commandos . With the laws the Englishmen give us . Go listen to our clever politicians in the House and you 'll learn how to keep the English rulers on the run . ' After eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hopes of a Cape Afrikaner uprising were pointless . These sturdy people with their schools and coffeehouses and politics were not interested in supporting a rebellion . Wait a moment ! ' Du Preez protested when Jakob voiced his disappointment . At first you asked , " Will you support the republics ? " Of course we 'll support them . We 'll argue your case in Parliament . We 'll speak out for you in every meeting . We 'll back you up with letters in our newspapers . ' But will you support us with arms ? ' Good heavens , no ! ' He did locate three young Afrikaners who offered to volunteer , but when he asked around about them he learned they were a bunch of ruffians unable to hold a job with any respectable English firm . The schoolteacher , Mr. Marais , said , I was unlucky enough to have two of them in my school . They 're wild , like old Rooi van Valck . ' Maybe that 's what we need . ' Good heavens , no ! There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keep your independence . Some may even want to join your fight . Perhaps the Boers near your borders . But do n't count on it . And the three rascals you have found wo n't help your army much . '  |p636  We have no army . Only commandos . ' Then you 'll lose the war . Because the English surely will have an army , and that makes a difference . ' Jakob was glad to be rid of Cape Town . The Afrikaners there seemed more interested in playing political games than in fighting for their freedoms . Little things had irritated him , too , like Du Preez and Carolus Marais saying Good heavens ! ' as if they were proper Englishmen . He saw other manifestations of this pervasive English influence , all making him think that the local Afrikaners were corrupted by their long severance from the Boers of the north . It was impossible to imagine Paulus de Groot in the Cape setting , or his own vibrant father , Tjaart . There were apparently two groups of Afrikaners now , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . iThe train puffed across the Cape flats to Stellenbosch , out beyond the broken hedge of bitter almond : it passed suburban backyards , small settlements and numerous farms . He had left Cape Town with no promises , but he felt confident that when he got among his own people at Trianon his reception would be different , for these Afrikaners lived outside the debilitating influences of the city , and he would be able to talk with them n specifics . When he saw the lovely tree-lined streets of Stellenbosch and the low white buildings , he felt that he had come to a town that had always been his . He stopped at a small , very clean whitewashed inn , where he had a ti room overlooking the central square and better food than he had enjoyed in some time . Three other travelers shared his table , men in from farms near Swellendam , and they wanted to know his business . When he told them that he was a Paul doing up there ? ' He 's facing down the English , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I would n't know what to do with more freedom if I had it , ' one of the farmers said . I mean freedom to worship as you wish . Have Dutch taught to your children . ' We have that now . ' Another broke in : You say your name 's Van Doom ? One of our Van Dooms ? ' The same . ' You 're not going to talk to them about joining Kruger 's ridiculous war ? ' It 's the duty of every good Afrikaner to support Oom Paul . ' Agreed , ' the three men said at once . And one added , I liked it when he took the strap and belted those lords of Johannesburg and their cheeky Uitlanders . But war . . . against England . . . With her navy ? And her empire ? Your people ca n't be serious about that ? ' Are n't you ? ' Jakob asked .  |p637  ' Good heavens , no . ' There was the phrase again , spoken in accented English , betraying the rruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from e heartland of the Volk , where great decisions were being made , that cy could not comprehend the problems facing them . He rose to leave is depressing assembly , but as he walked away one of the farmers arned him : ' Do n't go talking rebellion to the ones at Trianon . They sell heir wine to London . ' The warning was perceptive , for next morning when he hired a cart to arry him west to the winery , he could see that its vineyards were so subantial and so ancient that whoever owned them must perforce be a cauous man ; but when the driver swung about in a large circle to approach e house from the west , and Jakob saw for the first time that magnificent trance , with the white arms reaching out in welcome and the great ouse standing in pristine loveliness , he gasped . ' These are the Van Doorns of Trianon , ' he whispered respectfully . The place was like some palace he might have seen in a children 's book , all green grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the cart approached the big house the driver blew a small whistle , which brought the occupants fo the stoep . ' It 's Jakob come from up north ! ' the master of the house shouted to his children , whereupon he leaped off the stoep , rushed to the cart , and embraced this almost-forgotten cousin . ' I am Coenraad van Doom , ' he said , pushing Jakob back so he could see him better . ' And this is my wife , Florrie . The two boys are Dirk and Gerrit and the baby is Clara . Now come in . ' With real enthusiasm the young master of the vineyards , only thirty ears old , led Jakob through the front door and into the spacious line of ooms which comprised the forward leg of the H. In the center of this line stood the reception hall ; to the left , a lofty-ceilinged room for meetings ; to the right , the guest bedroom in which Jakob would stay . But once his bags were deposited , he was led back through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lively room where meals were served , off which the family bedrooms ranged . What was so very pleasing about the arrangement of this house was that gardens proliferated in both squares , so that all rooms were surrounded by flowers . The place had an air of elegance that almost overwhelmed Jakob . Young Coenraad showed himself to be an able fellow : ' My father died too soon , and someone had to take command . I feel quite submerged . I 've never been to Europe , you know , and most of our accounts are there . I must trust the opinions of others . ' ' Does the business prosper ? ' ' Famously . But I 'm worried . If this war talk continues . . ' I do n't think it will stop . Up north many people believe that war with England is inevitable . '  |p638  Wrong decisions , Jakob , are never inevitable . A wise man can always turn back from a precipice . ' Are you telling me  --  you , a Van Doom  --  that we Boers must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands and oppress us ? ' What oppression ? ' He almost laughed as he spoke . Jakob had no opportunity to pursue the matter , because young Coenraad saw his cousin 's visit as an opportunity to unravel the mysteries of the Van Dooms in South Africa , and before Jakob knew what was happening , a large sheet of white paper was laid down before him , with names and lines indicating the various members of the family : ' Willem and Marthinus in the 1600s I have . It 's the next generation that confuses us , is n't that right , Florrie ? ' His wife came to sit with the two men , explaining from the chart how the two sons of Marthinus had separated , one to father the Trianon wine-makers , the other to go out into the veld to form the Vrymeer line . But what was your ancestor 's name ? ' Coenraacl asked . Without having the family Bible at hand , Jakob could not trace his line so far back : My great-grandfather was a trekboer called Mal Adriaan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vrymeer . His father may have been the one who left Trianon , but I do n't recall his name . ' That must have been Hendrik . Who was your grandfather ? ' A famous fighter . They called him Lodevicus the Hammer . He had two or three wives . One was a Wilhelmina , I believe . My mother died only last year . Aletta , eighty-one years old ; I think her maiden name was Probenius . ' Carefully Coenraad drew in the lines , making estimates to account for the lost generations . It was a spotty genealogy they constructed , detailed the case of the Trianon Van Doorns , inaccurate regarding the trekkers . But we are cousins , ' Coenraad said expansively . That much we know . ' When Jakob tried again to bring up the question of volunteering during the forthcoming war , the wine-maker laughed easily and cut him off : No one at Trianon wants war . We have no quarrel with the English . ' And when Jakob started to argue that no Afrikaner would ever be spiritually free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his side of the table so that they could inspect the diagram of their family , and said firmly , That 'll be your war , Jakob , not ours . ' And he would permit no further discussion . In September 1 899 England began moving troops up to the Orange River and ordering home regiments and units from other colonies to reinforce the Cape and Natal garrisons . The two Boer republics loaded their arsenals also , importing Mausers from Krupp 's and long-range guns for the State Artillery , their only regular military organization . Late in the month the word went out to the commandos : Opsaal , burghers ! ' And when the Boers were told to saddle up , they knew that danger was at hand .  |p639  One of the first to respond at Vrymeer was Micah Nxumalo : Baas , Kaffirs at Groenkop , they got ponies . You want me to see if they 're y good ? ' Jakob nodded . What will those Kaffirs do in the war ? ' Nothing , Baas . Sit in their kraals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who occupied a valley far to e north ; some of their people worked for Boers , but they had never enly surrendered their tribal roots the way Nxumalo had done . They re , of course , part of the Boer republics , but no one took much notice of ? cse pockets of blacks so long as they behaved ' themselves . This would it be their war . Will your older boy be riding with us ? ' Van Doom asked . ' No . He stay with his mother . I go with you , Baas . ' It never occurred to Micah that he had an option in this matter ; if war . me , he would naturally ride with the Venloo Commando . His affection r Van Doom and his respect for the old general would dictate that . Next morning Paulus de Groot came over to Vrymeer ; he and Sybilla . ad left their miserable house and would stay with the Van Doorns until ? ecisions were reached . His only concern was whether the Venloo men ould keep him as leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? . urse they will . You were a general at Majuba , ' he replied with some xiety , With a commando , you never know . The burghers of Venloo 11 make up their own minds . ' In each district a new commandant was elected every five years , and . cause of his heroics at Majuba , De Groot had won the post every time , ut save for a few Kaffir raids and the rout of Dr. Jameson 's invaders , there had been eighteen years of peace , and there were a dozen young en claiming that they would be better at fighting the English . De Groot and Van Doom rode in to Venloo to meet with two hundred d sixty-seven other men who comprised the commando . They were a . ugh lot , burghers mostly in their thirties , but anywhere between sixteen nd sixty , with De Groot the oldest , ignoring his seven years past normal tirement . They met at the church , but not in it , for they were many and each wanted his say . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Boer nation discussed the looming war . We beat them at Majuba , ' De Groot said , eager to establish his credentials early , and we 'll donder them again . With these ! ' And he held up a Mauser . A wagonload of guns had arrived from Pretoria , and they were handed out . The new weapons caused much excitement , and there was so much free firing that the war almost ended for three burghers who got in the way of the fusillades . But the problem of who would lead remained unsettled , and this was of grave importance for a commando . Tonight it had two hundred and sixty-nine members ; tomorrow it might have four hundred or , if things went poorly , it could relapse into a veldkornetcy with less than a hundred fighters . It all depended upon how the war was  |p640  progressing , conditions in Venloo , and what the burghers thought of their leader . The law said that every male citizen had to serve when summoned , unless officially excused . The commandant-general , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the Boers had lost none of their independent Voortrekker spirit , nor their disregard for meddlesome authority . They might be ordered to serve in a commando , and Oom Paul might have a law which said they would be thrown in jail if they refused , but once they were in the saddle , they would recognize their leader only as chief among equals . If he made one serious mistake , half his troops might ride off in disy gust , and even if he were continuously brilliant , his burghers still migh go home if they grew sick of the war or apprehensive about its outcome Also , every fighting man considered himself free to quit the commando h was in and transfer to another , if he liked its fighting style better or con sidered its leader more apt to win his battles . It was crucial , therefore , to select the right man at the beginning , an one burgher said , Naturally , we would want you to carry on as comman dant , De Groot , a former general and all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt you could stand the chases . ' He can ride better than me , ' Jakob said . We need someone who can think quickly , ' another said . You kno the English are going to throw their best generals into this fight . ' It w uncertain whether this speaker was for old Paulus or against him , but fore he could clarify his statement , another said warmly , If De Groot di so well at Majuba , and when the Uitlander raiders came .. I think he 's too old . ' Without a vote having been taken , it seemed that sentiment ran som thing like 18o ? 89 in favor of the old man , but one of the complainan said with some force , This wo n't be Majuba or untrained Uitlanders. need someone young , with strength in the saddle . ' The commando decided not to vote that night , but to think some mo about the touchy problem ; each burgher was convinced that war wi England was only days away , that it would be demanding , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men wished to consult with Jakob , since he had been b ! both Cape Town and Pretoria : How does it look with the Boers at the Cape ? ' I found three boys who 'll be cleaning their rifles tonight . But we can forget about real help from the south . They will not fight . Say they 'll win their war on the floor of their Parliament , and that we 're wasting our tirn with commandos . ' Verdomp ! We 'll show them . God alone knows , we 'll show the whole damn world , too . ' Tell me , Van Doom , ' a thoughtful burgher asked . Who do you wan as commandant ? '  |p641  ' We already have one  --  Paulus . He 's a true leader . ' They left it at that , and De Groot slept that night at the Van Dooms ' ; before going to bed he said fervently , ' I would like to serve , Jakob . I have ideas about how to handle the English . ' We 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're too old . ' ' I am , ' De Groot conceded quickly . But I 'm the one with ideas . ' Next morning the burghers resumed discussion , and sentiment swung strongly to a vigorous young man who farmed east of Vrymeer , but someone pointed out that he was always talking about how clever the Hollanders in Pretoria were and how the Boers could learn some culture from them . That finished him , for while most Boers supported Oorn Paul in anything he did , they distrusted the Amsterdam clique around him , the hundreds who had been imported to serve in the Boer government . Some Venloo men said , ' The damned Hollanders are almost as bad as the Uitlanders . ' The vote was taken that afternoon , and old Paulus de Groot was retained as commandant , 20x-68 , grudgingly by some , who mumbled , ' We wanted someone younger . But we 'll give you a chance . ' All he said was ' Get your saddles ready . ' At Vrymeer the old man gathered everyone in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient Van Doorn Bible , he said , ' When God chooses a people to do His work , He places on that people many demands , but in our response He watches over us and always brings us victory . Sybilla , are you ready ? ' The old woman , her hair drawn tight across her head , nodded . ' Sara , will you guard the farm and the children ? ' The younger woman nodded , bringing her young son closer to her side . ' Girls , will you defend this home against the Englishmen , if they come ? ' ' We will , ' the twins said gravely , but Johanna , the older girl , merely nodded . ' Then your father and I can go to war with easy hearts . Let us pray , ' and in the farmhouse , so far removed from conflict , the eight farm people bowed their heads and clasped their hands : ' Almighty God , we know that You have called us to this battle . We know that as Your chosen people we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are Your instrument in bringing Your kingdom into being on this earth , and we submit ourselves to Your care . Bring us the victory You gave us in the past . ' On the morning of October 7 word reached Venloo that their commando was to depart immediately for the Natal border , but not to cross it until formal commencement of hostilities : ' You can stand with the forefeet of your ponies touching enemy territory . ' So the Venloo Commando formed up , and rode south . This commando consisted of two hundred and sixty-nine Boers , each  |p642  mounted on a sturdy pony which he supplied . Since each man dressed in whatever clothes he deemed appropriate for an extended stay in the field , the file looked more like a rabble than an army company . Some men wore heavy brown corduroys , some black , a few white . Most wore vests , unbuttoned , and about half had heavy coats of a wild variety . They wore veldskoen , heavy homemade field shoes of softened leather . The only item of clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hat : most of the men preferred the slouching Boer hat , which made them look like disgruntled sheepdogs . But even hats were n't uniform , for some men chose bowlers , tweed caps or almost any other available headgear . Behind them came some forty blacks , all mounted , leading twenty or thirty spare ponies . What made the Venloo Commando unforgettable were the units front and rear . Ahead of his troops rode General Paulus de Groot , sixty-seven years old , big , hefty in chest and belly , bearded , wearing the uniform that had distinguished him at Majuba : a formal frock coat with silver buttons and a tall black top hat . The side of this hat was decorated with a small republican flag embroidered by Sybilla with the words : vJR GOD ! VIR LAND ! VIR JUSTISIE ! His official rank was Commandant , but no one addressed him as anything but General . At the rear , behind the blacks and the remounts , came the wagons containing the sixteen wives who would accompany their men to the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-four years old , who said , I must go with my man in his war against that woman across the sea . ' This was typical of the Boer army , little disciplined , less organized , paid not at all , but well able to live off the land it fought for , with a Mauser and six legs for each man , because everyone was mounted . Its task : to defeat the combined armies of the British Empire . Ostensible blame for launching the Anglo-Boer War of 1899 was visible for all the world to see . At five o'clock on the afternoon of October 9 the Boer republics drafted an ultimatum which threw into the face of the British government demands of such an uncompromising nature that no selfrespecting major power could possibly have accepted them . Early in the morning of to October 1899 these demands were presented officially to the British cabinet , who reacted with surprise and delight : They 've done it ! They 've given us a cast-iron case . They stand before the world as the aggressors . ' That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news of this reaction reached Pretoria on the afternoon of October al , war officially began , and troops from both sides swung into action . A handful of rural Boers had brazenly challenged the might of an empire . But the real cause of the war was much more complex than an exchange of cablegrams over demands for arbitration and troop withdrawals .  |p643  It involved the same forces that had caused General de Groot 's storming of Majuba in 1881 , and those which had urged Cecil Rhodes to support the invasion of the Transvaal in 1895 . The English wanted to control all of southern Africa in one grand union of states and peoples ; the Boers wanted the freedom to conduct their own governments off to one side without interference from London . The English took up the case of the Uitlanders on the Golden , Reef . The Boers saw these fortune-seekers as a threat to their way of life . These interests conflicted , aroused animosities , and inevitably goaded the two nations into combat . If the Boers had not declared war on October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days . The sanest judgment that can be passed on the genesis of this terrible war between two groups of friends is that it was the result of imperiousness on the English side and intransigence on the Boer . Like rivulets wandering across a plain , coalescing at last to form a river , the various commandos heading toward Natal came together to create a Boer army . In time it contained some seventeen thousand men , and when they were assembled for the drive into English territory , old CommandantGeneral Joubert , in charge , decided to hold a review in honor of Oom Paul 's birthday to inspirit the troops and put them in a military frame of mind , so while he sat astride his horse to take the salute , the commandos galloped past , each man executing what he called a salute in the distinctive style he favored . Some doffed their big hats ; some merely touched the brim with a finger ; some yelled Boer fighting words ; some nodded ; a few shook their own hands and grinned ; and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man signified that he was ready . They galloped into Natal , prepared to sweep gloriously down to the Indian Ocean , capture Durban at the end of their ride , and deprive the English of a port through which to bring the reinforcements already on their way from London . General de Groot , with his Venloo Commando , tried to keep near the front of the advance , for he wished to lead the gallop down to the sea . Two heavily garrisoned towns obstructed the path of the Boers as they entered Natal  --  Dundee and Ladysmith  --  and it was De Groot 's urgent advice that they be by-passed : Give me a handful of commandos , we 'll dash direct to Durban . ' Had he been allowed to do this , he would have prevented English ships from landing reinforcements , and then , as he growled , Without supplies , the garrisons will wither up here and we can pluck them when we will . ' But the commandant-general felt that orderliness required that he capture these two strong points : We ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ? ' De Groot insisted that his charging raid to the seaport might win the war , but he was silenced with a stern command : Take your burghers toward Ladysmith . You 'll do your fighting there . '  |p644  So while thousands of Boers peeled off for the attack on Dundee , where the English commanding general was to be mortally wounded while his troops fled south , the Venloo Commando had to swing west , abandon the brilliant concept of a dash to the sea , and make for the hills overlooking Ladysmith . The town acquired this remarkable name because of the exploits of a dashing young officer , Sir Harry Smith , who made his historic ride from Cape Town to the defense of Grahamstown back in 1835 . He captivated the imagination of the local population . Later he returned to Cape Town as governor , and was enthusiastically welcomed by my children , ' as he called the Boers and blacks . But just in case the Xhosa had any dream of recreating the troubles they had caused him , he summoned two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his horse Aliwal , he held in his right hand a brass-headed wand signifying peace , and in his left , a sergeant 's stick representing war . The chiefs were ordered to step forward and touch the wand or the stick , indicating the course they wished to follow . Peace was the victor , but at a price : Now , to show that you submit to me and my Great White y Queen , you will kiss my foot . ' They did , whereupon Sir Harry shook their hands and reported : We have secured permanent peace . ' Alas , only three years later his Xhosa children invaded the frontier yet again , and once more he had to repulse them . Sir Harry also had his troubles with the Voortrekkers who crossed the Orange River , but the dashing governor and his lovely Spanish wife continued to enjoy such adulation that the people named a series of towns after them : Harrismith ; Aliwal , honoring his victory over the Sikhs at that place in India ; and two different towns named Ladysmith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to invest . Late on the second afternoon of the ride toward Ladysmith , a violent thunderstorm broke , making De Groot 's drenched burghers curse as they pushed through the torrent . He rode up front with Van Doom , head pulled in toward chest , a bitter anger darkening his face . Every step this horse takes , ' he grumbled , we 're farther away from the route to the sea . Damnit , Jakob ! Even if we do reach Ladysmith in good order , we 'll have to wait for the rest to catch up before we can attack . ' Then he voiced his real complaint : We 're missing the battles . ' He was mistaken . Two Boer scouts raced back and cried through the pelting rain , Die Engelese ! They 're fighting our men just beyond those gullies . ' We join them ! ' De Groot shouted as he spurred his horse . The commando plunged into the eroded rift in the veld , ponies slipping and sliding in the quagmire , then struggling up the opposite side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the rain cut visibility ; through a small telescope De Groot could barely discern a company of Boers , far distant . To his dismay , they seemed to be retreating : Where in hell are they going ?  |p645  To the Transvaal ? ' Without waiting for an answer , he headed directly toward the fighting . The Venloo burghers were thus projected into an experience which would go far in determining General de Groot 's future actions . To begin with , their scouting had been inadequate : the two young fellows sent forward miscalculated the capacity of the enemy force , encouraging the Boer contingent to advance too rapidly , ill-prepared for the shock the English were about to deliver . Boer losses had already been heavy and the retreat was general . De Groot judged that swift movement on his part might halt the rout , but as his men approached , the English commander unleashed a unit which up to now had been held in reserve : four hundred lancers roared onto the plain , sweeping toward the confused Boers . When they spotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke away and came directly at the new target . The Boers rarely charged an enemy on horseback ; they usually dismounted , tied their ponies , and fought on foot . Nor did they like the idea of one white man stabbing at another with bayonets and lances ; to them , decent warfare permitted only bullets , with stabbing a savage tactic resorted to by Zulu and Xhosa . But now here came the English cavalry , galloping like fiends across the open space , their lances flashing in the sunlight that broke through the clouds . It was a dreadful affray , those huge horses coming at the Boers , those long , sharp lances jabbing at the disorganized burghers caught unprepared in the open . Van Doorn narrowly escaped when a lance smacked into his saddle , jarring his pony to a deathly stop and tossing him to the ground . Luckily , he made it on foot to some rocks , but watched as a score of his fellow Boers were cut down . Because of the nature of a cavalry charge ? fifteen , twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single path  --  any Boer who was struck by one lance was apt to be hit by a dozen others , so that a dead body could be riddled . The Venloo Commando was broken and scattered , which encouraged the Englishmen to launch a second and third charge . On and on they came , yelling and shouting and spewing obscenities ; Van Doom heard one young officer cry , What a glorious pig-sticking ! ' His khaki uniform was splattered with blood ; this was a grand battue all over again , a wild and savage slaughter . Aside from the group of rocks in which Jakob hid , along with five others , there was no cover for any Boers who lost their ponies , so the razorsharp lances were free to pick them off at will as they ran screaming across the veld . Some of the commando did manage to escape on their ponies , and these closed ranks with De Groot ; their rapid fire from the saddle diverted the English cavalry from destroying trapped men like Van Doom , but nothing could stop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lancers withdrew , having lost only a handful of their men ; but when ashen-faced Van Doom inspected the bloodstained  |p646  veld he found more than seventy Boers slain , most with more than six deep gashes in their bodies ; one young fellow caught in the full path of the first and third charges had been punctured eighteen times . When De Groot saw this lad  --  the one who had dared to dance with Sybilla , who had kissed Johanna van Doom in the barn  --  and witnessed the obscene manner in which he had been stabbed , he stood over his young fighter and swore an oath : I will destroy the English cavalry ! He got his first chance during the ensuing battle for Ladysmith . Hav ing learned his lesson , he used the best scouts available : Micah Nxumal and two other blacks , who reported accurately the movements of the Eng lish cavalry . He moved his commando as close to the lancers ' position al he could , praying that they would accept the bait he was about to throe ' before them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But let the swine think they can eat us up like they did before . ' Like an old and practiced spider , he spun his web . On five success ' days he changed his guard an hour before dusk , instructing his men walk from their posts slowly , as if weary from the November heat . R placements were to arrive tardily and to appear listless . Six men or sev were to be visible between the tents , and there was to be desultory mov ment . Everything was to look like a poorly managed Boer camp , and f five days absolutely nothing happened . So he prolonged the drill , inven ing new pieces of activity which would help create the illusion , and o the eleventh day the English cavalry came out again , with nearly tw hundred men . The roles given the forward actors were perilous indeed , for the the dering cavalry was allowed right into the heart of the encampment , wi enough Boers running distraught to maintain the illusion , and these mu be adroit enough to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great cries of triumph , the cavalrymen hacked them to death . But when the sortie had passed through the camp , it found itse enfiladed not only by the survivors of the Venloo Commando but also one hundred burghers from the Carolina contingent borrowed for this casion , and from those grim Boers came a withering crossfire , aimed not the lancers but at their horses . And as the beasts went down or ran wild fury , Boer marksmen calmly shot any surviving cavalrymen . Only tho who surrendered instantly were spared , and not all of them . The Englishmen who made it through the fusillade regrouped at th4 far end of the camp and wanted to speed back to save their grounded con ' rades , and some daring horsemen tried , but when they were mowed do by concentrated rifle fire , their companions realized that this day 's bat was over . In a wide sweep they galloped away from the laager , returnin to Ladysmith a sadly depleted force . There was other bad news for the English . After the fall of Dundee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join the assault on Ladysmith , and when the English infantry marched out to give battl they were sorely thrashed , the Boers capturing more than nine hundre  |p647  oners . This meant that henceforth the troops in the town must stay on defensive , The English could hold on , but they could not swing over the attack . It was a notable victory for the Boers , but at the moment of triumph a tal weakness manifested itself : the Boer generals began squabbling ong themselves . Paulus de Groot , epitome of the daring commando der , repeated his request to ignore stalemated Ladysmith and gallop ? uth in wide , swinging raids , dashing right into Durban before reincements could be landed , but other commandants , who were frightened the idea of leaving a redoubt in English hands , insisted that brash De root stay with them , help them mount a siege , and gradually wear away e English defenders . We must strike while we 're free ! ' De Groot pleaded . Paulus , ' the old commandant-general said , if God extends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't grab for His entire hand . He would it like it if you galloped off to Durban . ' De Groot was ordered to remain , dig in , and passively watch the English in Ladysmith . That night he met with his veldkornets . I am sorely worried . Cornandos were born to move , we should be galloping south . ' When no one ? ke , tears came to his eyes . I can see us roaring into Durban . Taking ? e port . Throwing the English back into the sea . ' Still no one spoke . ce we let them land , they 'll be like bulldogs . They 'll never let go . ' The enloo men knew he was right , but they had their orders and there was . thing they could say , and again tears trickled down his beard . We sit re tonight , losing the war . ' Then carpe exhilarating news which assured the Boers that victory was 11 within their grasp : Boers on all the other fronts had won stunning ' etories , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea ? at would end the war . This time permission was granted , but he was restalled by precisely what he had feared : thousands of English troops ? ad sailed into Durban harbor and were already entraining for the north . his mighty force would quickly lift the siege of Ladysmith and go on to troy the Boers . The preponderance of power would rapidly become so overwhelmingve , sometimes ten well-armed professional soldiers against one fighting ? . -r , ten heavy guns to one  --  that the Anglo-Boer War should have ended ell before Christmas . In this opinion all the foreign military experts conrred . It was the custom in these years for any army in the field to invite niformed observers from friendly nations to march with it , observe its rformance , and report to their own headquarters the quality of this rmy 's fighting men . German officers rode with the Boers , and French and ' ussian and some South Americans , while the same nations sent other ? fficers to report on the English . At the end of 1899 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the English on the Natal front would rather quickly lift the  |p648  siege of Ladysmith and then , in an orderly fashion , bring in so man troops through Durban that victory was assured . But in early 1900 , aft an opportunity to assess the remarkable general London had dispatched . ? do the job , they became confused . Said the German observer in his cable to Berlin : With this man th English will be lucky to win in four years . ' But the French major wired in code to Paris : He 's the type who givthe enemy much trouble , the traditional English bulldog who holds o with every muscle in his body .

His appoi ment as commander-in-chief of the English effort in South Africa h. been bitterly opposed by one faction in the War Office and the cabinsomewhat tepidly supported by another faction that wanted a no-nonsen man in the field . He himself , when he heard of his impending selectio , wanted to avoid it , judging himself to be inadequate , for he had ne commanded a full army , but in the end he had accepted on the sensib grounds cited by many another man called to assume major respo sibilities : I 'm as good as any of the others .

He as of medium height , with an enormous belly , and had a strange head which once seen could never be forgotten . It was shaped like an eggplant , cavy and triple-chinned at the bottom , rising almost to a point at the top . is small eyes almost touched at the bridge of a very large nose , which arded a huge , bushy mustache that smothered his weak upper lip . As if e sought to accentuate the odd shape of his head , he favored a small , ght military hat with a long visor that obscured his vision . When he spoke , his one conspicuous asset manifested itself : his voice imbled with deep , masculine authority , but what it said was rarely understood , for a rambunctious horse had kicked out his front teeth . An irreverent Capetowner , startled by Buller 's appearance , whispered , He looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew Buller 's record for extreme bravery replied , Sir , you are wrong . He looks like John ull . ' General Buller proceeded directly to Government House , where he was briefed on the shocking prospects facing the English forces , for as the local officer explained : We are threatened on two fronts . On the west our troops are besieged at Mafeking and the diamond town of Kimberley . On the east they ca n't break out of Ladysmith . And we hear rumors that the Cape Afrikaners are about to rise in rebellion . ' So instead of occupying a relaxed position in Cape Town and directing his subordinate generals to dash this way and that , subduing the obstreperous Boers , Buller was faced with the awesome necessity of splitting his army into two parts and taking field command of one of them . I 'll need time to study this , ' he said , and forthwith he established his headquarters in a small house on a side street ; for his living quarters he chose rooms in the Mount Nelson Hotel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly purchased uniform of major in the local corps knocked on his door . To provide Buller with maximum support , Her Majesty 's government in Cape Town had scurried about to find some young man with strong business experience to serve as economic liaison , and upon the advice of several older men , Frank Saltwood was chosen . The men who selected him for this important post advised : You must find out as much about Buller as you can . Always helpful to know how a man 's mind works . ' For the past two weeks Frank had been doing just that , and like the military observers at the front , he was getting conflicting reports . Most important , ' an English official said , he 's of noble lineage . Duke of Norfolk , and all that . True gentleman , but of the rough sort . ' An English military man said , Enjoys the absolute confidence of the  |p650  General Staff . Good Old Buller , they call him . He 's welcomed at court , and Queen Victoria rather dotes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch-Huguenot descent who contributed the first important bit of information : Never forget that against the Zulu in 1879 he won the Victoria Cross . Bravery beyond description . Just set his jaw and walked right through enemy fire to rescue a group of wounded men . A man of extreme bravery . Proved it again in Egypt . ' The encomiums continued , explaining why he had been selected and constructing the portrait of the classic English general , and it was not until the third or fourth day that nagging details began to surface . One enlisted English soldier told Saltwood , You must remember , for the past eleven years it 's been mostly chair duty for that one . ' Another soldier who had seen Buller at the War Office in London contributed : He 's past sixty , I think , and gotten frightfully fat . Must have weighed eighteen stone when I saw him . ' A major newly arrived said , Only hearsay , but I believe the Staff was sharply divided about accepting him . Some wanted younger , harder drivers like Kitchener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roberts . There was grave suspicion that Buller might not be up to the challenge . ' Then why was he chosen ? ' Saltwood asked , scribbling rapidly to keep up with the flow of words . It was the general impression , ' the newcomer said , that he was a good fellow who deserved a shot at high command . ' He coughed , then added , He 's never led an army , you know . ' Why would they give such a man so important a job ? ' Well , he had been around a long time and it was his turn . ' A young Englishman who knew considerable about his country 's military system , and who was obviously perplexed by the appointment of Buller , said reflectively , It just occurred to me . Take all the leading generals assigned to this campaign . Not one has ever led his troops against an enemy that wore shoes . ' This extraordinary statement produced a thoughtful silence , broken by Saltwood , who asked , pen still in hand , What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barefooted Egyptians , and barefooted Sindi . " Shoulder-to-shoulder , men , and drive the pagan blighters back to the hills . " I know nothing about the Boers , but I believe they wear shoes . ' They do , ' a South African conceded . But essentially they 're a rabble . Buller should have no trouble with them . ' ' But a rabble with shoes , ' the young Englishman warned . It was an older English officer who gave Saltwood the most helpful information : I knew him in England , after his days of glory in the field . He had only two objectives . Build the best army possible . Do everything to protect the welfare of the troops . I 'm told in recent letters that he was n't the unanimous choice of either the War Office or the cabinet , but he was  |p651  a good choice . He had many Boers in his unit when he fought out here against the Zulu . He 'll respect them : It was with this body of conflicting opinions that Frank Saltwood approached Buller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been with the general two minutes , he realized that all his research had been useless . Frank 's major problem was understanding what the general was saying , for he had trouble pronouncing words because of his missing teeth , and those he did say were often lost in his mustache . Frank wondered if he had heard the opening words correctly . Glad to have you , young fellow . What I mean . . . hhmmph .. . you 're to fetch me an iron tub . ' Did you say iron tub , sir ? ' What I mean , if I have to go to the front meself . Man must have his bath , what ? ' You mean a tub to carry with you , sir ? ' Yes , damnit , what I mean , a man ca n't go dirty on bivouac , can he ? ' He also wanted a mobile kitchen so large that it would require an entire wagon and eight mules . He wanted a feather bed with extra blankets : Do n't want the cold to impede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole morning of this , in which Saltwood jotted down enough items to fill a small store , the general asked abruptly , How far to Stellenbosch ? ' The train might get you there and back in a day . But there are no troops , enemy or . . . ' Damn . Well , you know , in London and all that . ' Saltwood was quite lost until Buller mumbled , Trianon , you know . One of the really good wines of the world . I shall want fifty dozen of their best sparkling wine . ' That would be six hundred bottles , sir . ' Six hundred is what I want . ' That would require an extra wagon and eight more horses , but when Frank demurred a second time , Buller raged at him , showing the force which had made him a general to be feared : Damnit , man , this is a campaign , do n't you know ? Out in the field . Months on end , perhaps . Man wants his comforts . ' Saltwood was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because by the close of the second day he had encouraged his staff to fill the empty rooms at the Mount Nelson with the choicest free ladies of Cape Town , and with them on the scene , there was considerable revelry . On the third day Saltwood said , Sir , the officers want to consult with you . You 're aware , I presume , that the fighting is not going well ? ' Saltwood was astonished by what happened next ; it was as if a magician had waved a military wand , transforming this big , bumbling man into a tough-minded soldier . Buller stiffened , and with the riding crop he kept in his quarters , indicated a top-secret binder : I have me orders . Before I left London the wizards planned me entire campaign . Spelled out everything I was to do . ' He rapped the folder twice , not arrogantly , but in a gesture of  |p652  dismissal : And every plan they made was wrong . It does n't apply , not with those damned Boers . . . My word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you going to do , sir ? ' Buller rose , moved about his suite , then stopped and stared out the window at the confusing land he was supposed to conquer . Turning abruptly to face his new assistant , he said , Prepare to spend a long time in the field . I 've got to do exactly the opposite of what they order . ' He shoved the War Office directives aside . I 'm splitting me troops . Half to Kimberley to rescue them up there . You and I will be going to Ladysmith . ' He made this bold move to inspire the troops , but as a member of the clique opposed to him said , ' He did inspire ? the troops , but the wrong ones . ' And in London a wag circulated the rumor that the Boer high command had issued an order : Anyone who shoots General Buller will be courtmartialed . He 's our strongest weapon . ' Frank Saltwood , watching closely every move he made , believed at first that the critics and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Tugela River is that lovely stream which marked the southern limit of King Shaka 's Zululand , and along which Piet Retief 's people had waited while he and his men marched to their death at Dingane 's Kraal . When these waiting women and children were slaughtered a few days later , their blood ran into the Tugela . Now , at a small hill far upstream , Spion Kop ( Lookout Hill ) , General Redvers Buller was about to conduct a campaign which suggested that the German observer had been correct when he added to his first report : When you first meet Buller you instinctively like him . A real soldier . But when you study what he actually does in battle , you shudder . ' The town of Ladysmith was still under siege . Resolute Englishmen , lacking food , medicine , fire power , horses and sleep , protected the town against encircling forces . All England , which received telegrams direct from the town , wanted these brave defenders rescued , so when General Buller joined his massive army below the Tugela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with overwhelming superiority , twenty-one thousand against forty-five hundred , and he dispatched an unfortunate heliographed message to the besieged troops : Will rescue you within five days . ' There were two difficulties : he had to cross the river , and once that was done , his men would have to run a gauntlet through a chain of small hills . As the German observer reported later : He might have accomplished either of these tasks if faced alone , but to require him to meet both of them at once posed a problem so complex that he seemed quite unable to grapple with it . ' Buller sat on the south side of the Tugela for five days , pondering the difficulties , finally telling Saltwood , A frontal attack would be quite im-  |p653  possible . Never break through there , eh , Frank ? We face a long , hard fight . ' You said in England that it would be over before you got here . ' Would have been , if the other chaps had done their job . Now we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , going over and over his plans , but after he had swilled most of a bottle of Trianon , his eyes , already almost touching at the corners , seemed to come together , at which times he would drift away from battlefield problems and discourse on his theories of paradeground military combat : Keep the shoulders touching , move forward in line , do n't fire too soon , and the ruddy bastards will never stand up against an English march . ' With the Boers , it 's mostly cavalry , sir , ' Saltwood reminded him . Do n't like the cavalry . Never know where the devils will be going next . Give me foot soldiers every time . ' Sometimes late at night , when he was well under , he would grow sentimental : Worst thing ever happened to the English soldier , they put him in this damned olive-drab . Said it made him less a target . I say it killed his spirit . In Egypt you had six hundred gallant lads in bright red , marching in the sun . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . It struck terror . ' He never referred to his own bravery , which had been considerable , in all theaters of war , but if someone pressed him about his V.C. , he would say , There 's a job to be done , you press forward . No need to give a man medals . That 's his job . ' After all his sound deliberations on the folly of a frontal assault on a river and a chain of hills , General Buller changed his mind on the eve of battle and elected to do precisely that . We 'll roll back the Boers and lift the siege of Ladysmith , ' he told Saltwood triumphantly , and as if the deed were done , he sent another heliogram assuring the defenders that he would be there within five days  --  with plenty of food . With a shockingly inadequate map of the area and incomplete scouting sorties , he threw his men against the Boers , who stayed north of the river and picked them off in isolated batches . His fifteen-pounders , inspirited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enemy , rashly moved far ahead of their supporting infantry and were isolated . Rescue attempts failed and the guns were captured by the enemy , a loss of more than half the army 's field artillery . By nightfall one hundred and forty English soldiers were killed , to the Boer 's forty , and more than a thousand were wounded or missing . In dismay and confusion , General Buller ordered his first retreat from the Tugela and afterward dispatched one of the more shameful telegrams of military history . Ordering the heliographer to his tent , he scribbled a message , which Saltwood begged him not to send : It will dash the hopes of the Ladysmith defenders , sir . ' They 're soldiers . They 've got to know the worst . '  |p654  ' But let it come upon them slowly , I beg you . Not from their own commander-in-chief . ' Send the message ! ' Buller stormed , as if he were driven to prove himself an ass before the entire world , and it was sent , from an addled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult position : It appears that I can not relieve Ladysmith for another month , and even then , only by means of a protracted siege operation . I need time to fortify myself below the Tugela . When I 'm in position I suggest you burn your ciphers , destroy your guns , fire away your ammunition , and make the best terms possible with the Boers . A commanding general had advised one of his bravest subordinates to surrender while there was still a fighting chance to hold on . Buller himself , after a lengthy effort to pull his troops together , tried to ford the Tugela again and wound up in a second confused retreat . In desperation he told Saltwood , There must be a way to cross that river . I 'll think of something . ' It was imperative that he do so , for the general commanding the defenses at Ladysmith had refused to surrender , and it was obligatory that Buller try once more to rescue him . Instead , in his report to London he complained that he had been repulsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had eighty thousand in the field against me . ' To this , London replied acidly : Suggest you check population of total Boer republics , men , women and children . ' The rebuff infuriated Buller : Damnit , Saltwood , back there they do n't know these Boers . What I tried to tell them is that we 're not fighting an army . We 're fighting a nation . Men , women and children . ' With Buller ensnared , General de Groot sought permission to lead his commando on a wide sweep east of Ladysmith and deep into Natal : We can chop up the English supply lines . ' Permission was refused , and some of the finest horsemen in the world were held stationary to fight as unneeded foot soldiers . At the two battles of the Tugela they had conducted themselves with dignity , fighting from trenches and behind boulders , but slowly their numbers were eroding . From the original two hundred and sixty-nine , they had lost one hundred , and the waiting so irritated those remaining that more had simply gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-one . De Groot was aware that unless they soon enjoyed some kind of success , even that number must diminish , and then he would be in serious trouble . Therefore , when Christmas came , with all Boer troops still inactive , ten more Venloo men growled , To hell with this , ' and returned home to tend their farms . De Groot was now reduced to one hundred and fortyone disconsolate men , but he was enormously encouraged when three  |p655  young fellows of a different commando reported one day with the simple statement : Our fathers fought with you at Majuba . We 'd like to join you . ' It would be additions like these that would keep De Groot 's commando up to strength for the major battles that lay ahead . General Buller had been as humiliated as any general in history . His heliogram advising Ladysmith to surrender because he could think of no quick way to rescue it had been circulated to the cabinet , causing such a scandal that the War Office had to take action , and they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extraordinary man , Lord Roberts of Kandahar , approaching seventy , the hero of Afghanistan , five feet four inches tall , one hundred and twenty-three pounds in weight and blind in one eye . His chief-of-staff would be Lord Kitchener of Khartoum , and it was agreed that these two would really fight the Boers , while Good Old Buller could be left off to one side , wrestling with the Tugela River , which he had now failed twice to cross . To compound his problems , the War Office had given him as second in command a general whom he positively detested and to whom he preferred not to speak . For Sir Charles Warren , nearing sixty , this would have to be his last command , and unless he performed with some brilliance , he could hope for no further honors , which probably did not worry him , for he had other loves , especially archaeology and the secrets of Jerusalem . He had also made an abortive run for Parliament and a more successful one for head of the London constabulary , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he failed to uncover the mystery of the century : the identity of jack the Ripper . Quietly he moved back to the army , and when war broke out he reminded everyone that he had seen much service in South Africa , had helped solve the ticklish question of who owned the diamond mines , and knew a thing or two about the Boers . ' Warren despised Buller , holding him to be an ass , but it was nevertheless essential that he keep close to the old general because Warren carried in his pocket a most dangerous piece of paper : it was called a Dormant Commission , ' and it stated that if anything should happen to Buller , or if he should fall apart , as seemed likely , Warren was to assume command . Consequently , it was in Warren 's interest to see that Buller did fail . Relieved of responsibility for the other fronts in South Africa , General Buller was free to direct all his attention to the Tugela River , and as he rode back and forth along its southern shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to see that his previous attempts had been doomed because he had been heading straight for Ladysmith along roads which had to be heavily defended . What he would do would be to dash far to the west , outflank the Boers , and swing into Ladysmith in a leftward charge . With Warren 's troops he again had more than twenty thousand first-class men to face a Boer force of less than eight thousand . But he had Sir Charles Wan:en breathing down his neck , and he still had to cross the Tugela . A flanking movement like this required speed and deception ; unfortu-  |p656  nately , Buller surrendered both those advantages by entrusting the most important part of the campaign to the ex-policeman , ' as he contemptuously called Warren . Sending the difficult and unreliable Warren off to the left , he moved his own sybaritic tent some twenty miles upstream , and when his feather bed and iron bathtub were in position , he astonished Saltwood and his other aides by scouting the opposite shore with his French telescope . He did this by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his enormous belly and toes , moving it slowly through whatever arc his position permitted , and shouting his observations to Saltwood . By now , newspapers throughout the world knew that General Buller is once more thinking about crossing the Tugela . ' What he saw when he lay prostrate looking through his toes were three hills perched menacingly behind the north shore of the Tugela : Hill One , nearest at hand ; Hill Two in the middle ; Hill Three well to the west . The plan was for Warren to move far west of Hill Three and cut the Boer line , if he ever got his land-armada across the river , with his innumerable wagons and fifteen thousand trek-oxen ; this incredible train was fifteen miles long and required two days to pass a spot , even when moving sharply . Buller would then make a drive for Hill One and join up with Warren , opening the pathway to Ladysmith . A tremendous amount of staff work was done to prepare the English forces for these carefully planned moves . At Warren 's crossing point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , and as they huffed and puffed , belching fire , wagons were pulled across small crevices while engineers sought low spots in the river at which pontoon bridges might be built . They isolated three such spots , and their officers chose each one in turn , abandoning it as soon as any difficulty arose . The delay was intolerable . Saltwood had found it a memorable experience to watch these two elderly generals , Buller and Warren , go about their planning of this crucial battle , for it became apparent that in their extreme jealousy , neither was backing up the other , and each was holding his choice cards tight to his chest without permitting his colleague to see them . One of Buller 's most ambitious young assistants told Frank , We 're going to witness three great battles . Us against the Boers . Buller against Warren . And Warren against Buller . ' Dreadful way to run a war . ' Ah , but the last two battles will be well matched , because our two generals are of equal intelligence , somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird dog . ' Buller told me yesterday we 'd be ready to strike tomorrow . ' It wo n't happen . General Warren has this curious fixation that armies should be allowed to get into position and face each other for three or four days . Get the feel of contest . '  |p657  We 've been trying to get the feel of it for two months now , ' Frank said . Those poor devils in Ladysmith : They 've nothing to worry about . Buller heliographed them again yesterday that he 'd be there within five days . ' Any chance ? ' Frank asked . If Warren punches west through the Boer line , I 'm sure we can make it . But if he swings over to Hill Two in the middle , we 'll be in deep trouble . ' Would he do such a thing ? ' With these two generals , anything can happen . ' Tonight we should pray , ' Saltwood said , and he did . It did not help . For days Warren plodded along until Buller , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could no longer contain his anger . Riding over to Warren 's headquarters , he said gruffly , For God 's sake , move ! ' There are thousands of Boers out there waiting . ' There were only ten hundred when you started . ' I 've decided to go for Hill Two , ' Warren said . The young officer had been correct in his fears that these two generals would dissipate their great opportunity : the ex-policeman ' was swinging to his right to club the Boers on Spion Kop . With incomplete orders to the troops involved , the vast plans were scrapped and whole battalions were ordered to march right when they had planned to go left . What seemed incredible then , and even more so now , they were to attack a sizable hill that no one had scouted and for which only the roughest maps existed . This error could easily have been corrected had General Buller authorized his balloonist to go aloft , for the man was a skilled observer and from twelve hundred feet , his optimum operating level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Buller did not hold with balloons and other such nonsense , so this invaluable tool was not used ; the troops would march up Spion Kop with no concept of where they were going or what they might face when they got there . What was worse  --  much worse , as it turned out  --  General Warren kept his headquarters far to the west , which would have been reasonable had the drive continued in that direction , while General Buller kept his far to the east , removed from everything . When Major Saltwood protested this wide separation of the two headquarters  --  seven miles with crude communications  --  Buller growled through his enormous mustache , It 's his show . He 's in charge of the troops . ' But you 're the commander-in-chief , sir . ' Never meddle with another man 's fight . ' ' But it 's your battle , sir . ' It 's Warren 's day . He 's got the finest English troops to win the battle . ' Frank wanted to cry , Then God save the empire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven miles to General Warren 's headquarters , where he arrived in time to witness an incomprehensible performance . Warren had in his command a brilliant , headstrong cavalry leader named Lord Dundonald , a charismatic type whom the older generals distrusted , and when this fiery chap , leading fifteen hundred of the finest mounted troops , was set loose on the left flank , he launched a glorious charge which quite neutralized Hill Three and gained access to an unpatrolled road along which Warren 's infantry could advance directly into Ladysmith . By this daring and gallant maneuver he opened the way to an English victory , and the younger officers were cheering when Frank reached their headquarters : Dundonald 's done it ! He said he would . ' But then Warren sprang into action . Gray with fury , he stormed into the room where the younger men were cheering and cried , Bring that damned fool back here . We need cavalry to protect our oxen . Let him keep a few men on his damned road , but I want the rest back here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saltwood and two others to ride posthaste after the cavalry and bring them back . Damned young fellows ! Put them on a horse , they think they know everything . ' Saltwood , not being a member of General Warren 's force , was not afraid to confront him : Sir , I believe Lord Dundonald should be allowed to hold the road , and we should rush men to ensure he keeps it . ' He 'll come back here , and he 'll obey my orders . My God , I 'll take his horsemen away from him . Insubordination . ' So Frank Saltwood had the miserable task of riding west to inform the gallant young Lord Dundonald that he was to pull back the bulk of his men . On this day Dundonald had beaten off a series of Boer patrols in savage encounters ; he had won a notable victory ; but now he must retreat . The burghers would win this segment of the battle without having fired a shot ! On the night of 23 January 1900 General Warren sent his men up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a major-general , but he was fifty-five years old , had weak legs and did not take easily to steep places , so that he had to be shoved up them by his troops . Poor man , he was soon dying from a shell fragment . What ensued must have been orchestrated by some mad genius , because both Warren and Buller , from their separate headquarters , appointed different replacements to the vacant major-general 's slot . Unfortunately , communications collapsed and no one knew who was in charge . There were , as a consequence , two British officers conducting the fight , each unaware of the other and assuming that he was in supreme corn- 1 mand . Two additional officers were sent in to take charge , one by Buller , one by Warren , and once again each assumed that he was in sole command . One way or another , the hill now contained four commanders leading  |p659  nineteen hundred of the empire 's finest , while another eighteen thousand were kept in reserve ; they would be sorely needed as the terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march . In grandeur General Buller sat in his tent like a sulking Achilles , out of contact with the progress of the battle and doing nothing to sort out the mess his ex-policeman ' was getting his men into . It 's Warren 's fight , ' he insisted when Saltwood galloped back from the other general 's camp , begging for clarifications . On the other hand , Buller was not loath to intervene whenever a particularly brilliant idea occurred to him , and he issued commands that would have bewildered generals as quick-minded as Hannibal and Napoleon . As for Warren , he was a fool who moved at a snail 's pace , fighting a night battle on a hill he did not comprehend . Not once did he move to Spion Kop ; not once did he try to see for himself the dreadful slaughter occurring there . He issued some twenty crucial orders , half to one of his commanders on the hill , half to others battling toward it . A German observer watching this amazing battle said , The English army is composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers who are asses of stupidity . ' And he said this before the two generals had an opportunity to display their true talents . General de Groot chafed . Much against his counsel , his truncated commando was being held in reserve behind Spion Kop . We 'll throw you in at the crucial moment , ' he was told , but two more of his men , seeking action , had slipped away . The scene behind the hill was extraordinary . Row after row of sleek Boer ponies stood with their halters tied to trees or rocks while their masters fought on foot up the steep hill . Some five hundred wagons huddled at a distance , field ambulances and Red Cross units outspanned among them , their oxen peacefully grazing . Near them waited the wives who had accompanied their husbands , and in one tent Sybilla de Groot tended such men as were dragged to her impromptu hospital ward . Other women helped their servants do the cooking , and from time to time everyone would stop to listen to the raging battle which was taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they worked . When , toward noon , General de Groot walked back through the dust to talk with his wife , the women learned that whereas the English troops had captured the top of the hill , they had placed their trench so poorly that the Boers had a good chance of taking it away from them . Will there be many dead ? ' Sybilla asked . A great many , ' the old man said . Will you be going up ? ' Soon as they set us free . ' Be careful , Paulus , ' she said as he shuffled back to the hill .  |p660  It was men of the Carolina Commando , from the small town east of Venloo , who won the honors for bravery this day . They were led by Commandant Henrik Prinsloo and a short , stocky veldkornet named Christoffel Steyn , almost as thick through the belly as he was tall ; when Steyn ran forward , rolling from side to side , men muttered , If he can do it , I can do it . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the top of Hill Three , a kopje opposite the summit of Spion Kop , where he positioned his men behind rocks so that they could fire directly into the side openings of the English trenches . This fat fellow , who had never fought before , could not believe that the highly trained English officers opposing him could have allowed him to occupy this fatal hill , but he accepted his luck and ordered his men to increase their fire into the exposed English ranks . Whole trenches were wiped out , not a single man surviving , and of ten dead soldiers , nine had been shot not through the front of their bodies , but through the side of the head . Christoffel Steyn 's men had made the difference , but they did so from a hill they should never have been able to occupy for as long as they did . Why the ragged line of burghers was permitted to hold the strategic kopje was one of the disgraceful incidents of this battle . While eighteen thousand crack troops still remained in reserve , powerless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kop , a commander of the King 's Royal Rifles , on his own initiative , dispatched his two finest battalions , ordering them to rush another hill opposite to the one held by Steyn . If they were successful , they could drive Steyn out with gunfire , and thus save the men on Spion Kop . It was an impossible ascent , almost straight up , in heat of day , with Boers firing down at them from above , but these brave men , goaded by their energetic officers , somehow made it to the top , drew much of the fire away from their exposed comrades , and began to batter the Carolina burghers . It was a triumph of courage and grit , giving the English their first victory of the day . Saltwood , witnessing the triumph , hastened to inform General Buller , but when this confused leader heard that a commander of troops had acted on his own , and had , furthermore , split his men into two groups , he fell into a fury and began to heckle his commander . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boers were in such firm control that if the King 's Royal Rifles tried to cross over to Spion Kop , they would be annihilated . ' Bring them back down ! ' Buller fumed . Sir ! ' Saltwood objected . They 've performed a miracle . Let them stay . ' 1 They should never have been split into groups . ' The commander , seeing his general in such confusion , lost all confidence in the daring action and signaled his men to climb down : Get off the hill ! Come back immediately ! ' At first the men refused to believe that such a stupid order could have been issued , and one colonel refused  |p661  to obey it . Damn them all , ' he shouted , whereupon a Boer bullet struck him below the heart , killing him instantly . The retreat began . Night fell as the beleaguered soldiers on Spion Kop watched with dismay as the King 's Royal Rifles abandoned the neighboring hill . For a few more hours the officers on Spion Kop held their positions , but finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroic man , Colonel Thorneycroft , had been breveted general in the midst of the battle ; he weighed about twenty stone  --  two hundred and eighty pounds  --  most of it hard muscle , and he was afraid of nothing . Only his courage had kept the trenches in English hands , despite the awful slaughter , but now he lost his nerve . He led his brave men down the hill , conceding defeat , just as one of the other commanders was climbing up with fresh troops , hoping for victory , They passed in silence . When the new commander reached the crest of Spion Kop , in darkness , he found an amazing situation : the Boers , who had faced tremendous fire that day , had decided , half an hour before General Thorneycroft began to evacuate troops down the hill , that Spion Kop could not be taken . The constant pressure of the English gunners had been more than even these Boers could absorb , and they had deserted the hill . They knew they were defeated . In other words , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight , had decided within fifteen minutes of each other that the day was lost . Their two retreats occupied the same moments . After deaths innumerable , Spion Kop was deserted . The Englishman climbing up as Thorneycroft went down was the first to discover this ; he was another of the four in command that tangled day , and now he had a chance to save the day for the English . All he had to do was rush back down the hill , signal his superior , General Warren , and convince him to send more troops scurrying back to the summit . Full victory rested in the hands of the English if only this officer could contact General Warren . This could not be done . The officer framed an excellent message , calling for quick reinforcements to occupy the abandoned hill and explaining how victory was assured , but when he summoned the signalman and told him to use his night lantern to flash the good word to General Warren 's headquarters , the man said , I have no paraffin . ' Try the wick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The signalman lit his wick . It did not even sputter . For want of a thimbleful of kerosene , the fateful message was not sent . The Battle of Spion Kop was lost . While those futile efforts were being made to get English soldiers back onto Spion Kop , on the northern side of the hill a few of the defeated Boers consulted at two in the morning concerning their fate , and as an oc-  |p662  casional rifle shot echoed from some distant place where soldiers were nervous , they whispered in the darkness , ' General de Groot , what did you think of the battle ? Could we have won ? ' ' I was n't allowed in the battle . They never called for our reserve . ' ' Our losses were heavy , General . But not like the English . Did you hear about the Carolina Commando ? They had a clear shot , right down the English trenches . They killed everybody . ' It was another young fellow , only a boy , really , who asked the question that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the eastern hill when the English crawled up and took it . Why did they go back down ? ' In the darkness General de Groot asked , ' You saw them go down ? ' ' Yes . They were very brave . One officer . . ' But they went back down ? ' ' Yes , they drove us off the hill . We lost sixteen , seventeen men . Jack Kloppers standing beside me . Right through the forehead . ' De Groot took the lad by his shoulders , pulling him into the flickering light of a small fire . ' You say they held the hill , then abandoned it ? ' ' Yes . Yes . I covered Jack Kloppers with a blanket and I went back to the summit . They went down and we did n't even fire at them . ' For some minutes General de Groot stood in silence , looking up at Spion Kop . Finally he said in a very low voice , ' Son , I think you and I should go back up that hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reserve for this moment . ' He asked for volunteers , and Jakob van Doorn , of course , stepped forward . So the three tired Boers , at two-thirty on that dark , forlorn morning , set out to climb the hill where so many had died . In front , walking faster than the others , was Paulus de Groot in top hat and frock coat . Behind him came the lad who had occasioned this expedition , and behind , puffing heavily , came Jakob van Doorn , who had been quite content to have his commando held in reserve : death terrified him . They climbed slowly , for there was no moon , and from time to time they trod on the face of some fallen comrade . When they approached the crest , where the fighting had been most hazardous , they stepped on many bodies , and then the old general , his hat still in place , rose upon the horizon in a position which would have been fatal had English troops been on the hill . Slowly the other two joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death , they moved forward , coming to the trench ' where the English lads lay stacked , bullets through the sides of their heads , and all the way to the other edge of the plateau , where they could look down upon the silent camp of the enemy . Running back to the center of the silent battlefield , where he assured himself that this miracle had taken place , Paulus de Groot removed his hat , placed it over his heart , and kneeled in the bloody dust : ' Almighty God of the Boers , You have brought us victory , and we did n't know it . Al mighty God of the Boers . . . dear faithful God of the Boers ... '  |p663  The sky was brightening when he straightened up and walked to the edge of the hill to alert his comrades below : Boers ! Boers ! ' In their bivouac the commandos had watched as sun began to break , uncertain as to what they might have to face this day from that bloody embattled mount . An incredible sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky , stood an old man , the victor of Majuba nineteen years before , waving his top hat triumphantly . General Paulus de Groot had captured Spion Kop . There had been at the hill that twenty-fourth day of January 1900 three young men of radically different character ; no one of the three saw the other two , but each would live to play an outstanding role in the future history of his particular country . The oldest was a Boer officer , only thirty-seven , on whom fell the burden of rallying his troops when all seemed lost and sustaining them when the leadership of the older generals proved defective . Had some young English colonel of comparable ability managed to insert himself in place of his own wavering and slow-witted generals , that side would probably have won this crucial battle ; fortune dictated that it would be the Boers who would act intelligently . This splendid military genius was Louis Botha , who would become the first Boer prime minister of the new nation that would emerge from this battle . At Spion Kop young Botha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced that Boer and Englishman would do better if they worked together . In the rage of battle he knew that this internecine warfare was senseless , and that unless the two white races coalesced in their common interests and humanity , South Africa must be torn apart . He became the great conciliator , the prudent counselor , the head of state , and few names in the history of his country would stand higher . The youngest of the men was a rowdy newspaperman whom nobody could discipline . Reporter for a London paper , he wrote penetrating , irreverent accounts of men like Warren , so that proper military men shuddered when he approached . He was then tallish and slim , and spoke with a lisp that caused merriment among the sturdier types . He had not done well in school , had avoided university altogether , and was thought of as pretty much a freak . Because of carelessness , he had already been captured once by the Boers but had escaped through sheer brazenness . There was a kind of price on his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he been captured at Spion Kop , things might have been rather sticky . In spite of this , he climbed three times to the crest of the hill , where he was revolted by the confusion and inefficiency . He was Winston Churchill , twenty-five years old , already the author of several fine books and desperately hungry to get into Parliament . A brief fourteen years after this day on Spion Kop , young Churchill would find himself in the middle of a much greater  |p664  war , and in the war cabinet , and in charge of naval operations . At Gallipoli he would interfere in military matters so disgracefully that he would ensure the tragic defeat of a major English operation , so that his name became synonymous with civilian incompetence . On Spion Kop that day he had learned a lesson from defeat , for when the battle was dismally lost , General Buller at last took complete charge , and in rallying his men he was superb , a stubborn man with iron courage who stared into the face of catastrophe and assured his troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were willing to support him . Of Buller , Churchill wrote : It 's the love and admiration of Tommy Atkins that fortifies him . ' In 1941 this lesson in bulldog tenacity would lead Winston Churchill to immortality . The third young man was a curious type ; scrawny , short , spindlylegged , very dark of countenance , with even darker hair , he served that day as an ambulance runner . If Louis Botha had seen him , he would have ignored him as an unwelcomed immigrant ; had Winston Churchill seen him foraging among the dead to ascertain if even one man still survived , he would have dismissed him as inconsequential . Born in India , he had surveyed that impoverished land and decided that it held no promise for young lawyers , so he had eagerly emigrated to South Africa , where he fully intended to spend the remainder of his life . His name was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi , volunteer stretcher bearer to the English forces . Aware that the ruling castes , Boer and Briton , held all Indians in disdain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the war 's most dangerous service to prove their worth ; on this day he had escaped death a score of times , and two of his associates had been killed . On Spion Kop , Mohandas Gandhi learned that warfare was unutterably stupid , that it solved no problems , and that when the dead were collected and the medals distributed , the warring parties still faced their insoluble problems . How much better had they avoided violent discourse and taken resort to peaceful non-resistance . There was a fourth man on Spion Kop that day , or rather that night , but no one paid him any attention , and he did not rise in later years to lead his nation , but on this encrusted battlefield he did learn the first and only of his great lessons . When General de Groot , at two-thirty in the morning of the day following the battle , climbed back up Spion Kop , there were two men with him , the young fellow who alerted the move and Jakob van Doorn , his constant companion . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't count . He was Micah Nxumalo , who would never be far from the old general in the days of this war . He did not have to participate , and he had no gun to defend himself ; he merely tagged along because he loved the old general and had served him in various capacities . He could tend horses , scavenge for food , help the women , serve as scout when conditions grew tense , and tend the sick commandos . On Spion Kop , Micah Nxumalo began to develop a great truth which he would later quietly pass along to his people . As he moved through that fiery day , seeing the troops who seemed so numerous , he noticed that  |p665  taken altogether , they numbered far fewer than his Zulu tribe , or the Xhosa , or the Swazi , or the Basuto , or the Bechuana , or the Matabele . He saw that the English and the Boers were playing tremendous games , but that when the battles were finished they would be brothers , a few white men set down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ended and the mighty guns are silenced , the real struggle will begin , and it will not be Englishman against Boer . It will be white man against black , and in the end we shall triumph . For the duration of the present episode Nxumalo would continue with the Boers ; they were his proven friends ; and he hoped they would win this time . But he was struck by the fact that an equal number of blacks served with the English , hoping , no doubt , that they would win . When the disaster of Spion Kop was ended , with the land-armada once again south of the Tugela , and the fifteen thousand trek-oxen pulling the massive wagons back to where they started , Frank Saltwood had to evaluate the performance , which he had witnessed mainly at Buller 's elbow : He had rotten luck . Having that Warren thrust upon him . What a dunderhead ! The battle could have been won four different ways , and he rejected them all . But then the question arose : I wonder why Buller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more he thought about this the more he realized that as a South African not reared in the English military tradition , he could not appreciate the reticence one general would have in ever bringing criticism upon another : They 're a fraternity of aging warriors , each supporting the other , each attentive to the traditions of the service . Losing a battle is far less important than losing relative position in the hierarchy . But even Saltwood had to admit that not all the blame could be thrown on Warren ; Buller , too , had participated in the gross errors : He gave Warren command , then intervened a score of times . After all , it was my man Buller who heckled the commander of the King 's Royal Rifles until those brave men were ordered to retreat . When he had lined up in his mind all the pros and cons , one fact persisted : Buller 's foot soldieis consider him the best general they ever served under . I 've asked a score of them . Always the same answer : I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . ' And now Saltwood realized that many of the horrendous decisions he saw Buller make were done to preserve lives . He might drink too much Trianon sparkling , and as one correspondent wrote , he did eat gargantuan meals ; but where human life was concerned , he was Spartan . Train them hard , ' he had told Saltwood . Drive them hard . But bring them back in good order . ' When Frank asked about this , the old man said , Most important fact of war ? Keep your army in existence . Lose the battle , but keep your eye on winning the war . ' But everyone in Buller 's command had to be aware of the attacks  |p666  being made upon their general by the experts in Europe . London newspapers began calling him The Ferryman of the Tugela . ' In Parliament he was known as Sir Reverse Buller . ' After the last debacle he humphed and mumbled , By gad , they 're splendid troops . Retreated without losing one gun carriage . ' To which Saltwood said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had plenty of rehearsal . ' General Buller looked at him with his tiny pinched eyes and laughed . Yes , yes . What I mean , yes . They are great troops . ' He sent another smashing heliogram to the besieged heroes at Ladysmith , assuring them that he would rescue them within five days , and with fortitude he crossed the Tugela yet again , only to get a shocking bloody nose which sent him reeling back across that pitiful stream once more . In Ladysmith the rations were diminishing , and at the end of twelve weeks Buller was no closer to the town than when he started . Still he had the gall to heliograph yet again that he would succor the town at any moment now . In view of the growing criticism , Saltwood sometimes wondered why the British authorities allowed him to retain command . There was one reason , tragic and accidental . In Buller 's first attempt to cross the Tugela , that masterpiece of ineptitude , a gallant young officer volunteered to rescue some heavy guns that were about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he happened to be the son of Lord Roberts , who would shortly become Buller 's superior . Now , lest Roberts appear vengeful over a death for which Buller was in no way responsible , he remained silent , when otherwise he would have recommended his removal . A more subtle explanation was given to some French and German observers one night by a young English officer : The War Office wants generals like Buller . They 're never comfortable with uncertain types like Kitchener and Allenby . Buller is steady , which they like , and not too clever , which they prefer . As a young man he obeyed orders and plunged ahead . You should have seen him , they tell me , wading into Egyptians . Very forceful . They like it that he ca n't speak clearly , that he harrumphs all over the place . That 's how a proper general should behave . Look at Raglan and Cardigan at Balaklava . ' But why in God 's name do n't they dismiss him when his deficiencies become known ? ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English . That 's why you 'll never understand us . Who appointed Buller ? The establishment . The older generals . The older politicians . Probably some of the archbishops had a hand , if the truth were known . They like him . They trust him . He 's one of them . Good family , you know . ' But he 's destroying the army , ' the Frenchman protested . The army ! What 's the army ? The important thing is that men like Buller be protected . He is England , not some damn-fool lieutenant who got his legs blown off . ' In Germany he would n't last a week . '  |p667  In England he 'll last forever . ' You speak as if you love the old fool . ' I do , ' the young man confessed . He 's a doddering ass , and I love him . Because most of the people at home I love are just like him , and somehow they always do the right thing . You watch , when the decisive battle of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way ahead , just as he did with the Egyptians . ' I wish to God he were forty years younger , ' the German said . Why ? ' Because when our war against England comes , and it will , I would like him to be in command . ' He will be , ' the young man said . Under a different name . And beware of him . ' As he spoke , he tacked onto the bulletin board a notice from Lord Roberts on the other front ; it referred to some of his associate officers in the South African war : Douglas Haig , John French , Julian Byng , Edmund Allenby , Ian Hamilton . They would be the General Bullers whom the Germans would have to face . With these confused judgments rattling in his head , Major Saltwood watched with pride as General Buller finally figured a way to cross the Tugela , and that night he wrote to Maud , who was busy organizing charities for the wives of Cape men serving with the English forces : It was damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we get them from the navy , you know , put them on his flank and laid down a hellish barrage , right ahead of our advancing troops . Like a fiery broom he swept away the Boers . So at least we 're across this damned river , but I can not bring my pen to say , We 'll lift the siege of Ladysmith in five days . ' We 've said that too many times before . But soon we shall be there . On 28 February 1900 , ninety-five days after he assigned himself the task of relieving Ladysmith , the siege was lifted . Three memorable incidents marked the stirring occasion . Lord Dundonald , always eager for acclaim , dispatched a unit of his cavalry to be first into town . He followed , and in his company was Winston Churchill , almost a full day ahead of General Buller . Later , when the general 's more pompous entrance was made , he got his maps mixed up and marched to the wrong gate ; the heroic defenders , military and civil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it was pointed out to him that since he and his men were fresh , and on wellrested horses , it might be gracious if he rode to the other side , he said , I enter here , ' and the multitude had to hurry across town to greet him . And finally , when the defeated Boers were in retreat , some of the cavalrymen saw a chance to chase and destroy . When they started from  |p668  the town , some of the men who had withstood the siege wanted to join , but could not : We have no horses . We ate them . ' Where are those cavalrymen going ? ' Buller asked Saltwood . Pursuing the enemy . ' Pursue an enemy who 's been honorably defeated ? Good God , call our men back . Give the poor devils decent time to lick their wounds . ' Sir , we 've been chasing those damned Boers for months . This is our chance to eliminate them . ' From beneath his tight little hat General Buller stared at his South African aide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman . ' When Frank tried to protest , Buller put his heavy arm about his shoulder . Son , if we lose honor in warfare , we lose everything . ' And he canceled the pursuit . General de Groot was bewildered . For more than four months his commando had been abused and misused , and he could do nothing about it . Instead of riding hard and fast in a strike-and-hide tactic , at which his horsemen would have excelled , he had been held in rein and used in assault efforts . It occurred to him , as he sat with Sybilla after the defeat at Ladysmith , that almost never in these four months had his pony been at a gallop , and rarely a trot . You know , Sybilla , we 're losing men all the time . Our burghers wo n't tolerate this sort of thing . ' They 'll come back , when your kind of fighting begins . ' You ca n't have a commando with nine men . ' Then shocking news from the western front reminded them of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obstinate man who believed that the best defense against English arms was a laager , had surrendered . What could he have been thinking of ? ' De Groot asked Jakob . With four thousand men , you and I could take Durban . ' It 's a different war over there . General Roberts is in a hurry . He 's no Buller . ' This doleful news , coinciding with Ladysmith , generated a vast depression among the retreating Boers , so that the Venloo Commando was reduced to one hundred and twenty , and when the time came to hand out assignments , those in charge looked at De Groot with pained tolerance : What can you do , Paulus , with so few ? ' We can attack the cavalry installation , ' he replied with that bitter animosity he held for the English lancers . They 'd slaughter you ! ' We would n't take them head-on . ' He was so , persuasive that permission was granted for what could only be a suicide attempt , except that he had no intention of allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including , of course , Van Doorn , and they  |p669  would move quietly across the Orange Free State to where Generals Roberts and Kitchener held their troops after their big victory over Cronje , and they would ride daringly close to the cavalry cantonment , trusting the natural confusion of a large assembly of horses to mask their approach . They would then dismount , wait till three in the morning , when attention was always at a minimum , sweep in , disrupt the horses , and fight any personnel that might be afoot . In the confusion they would run to their ponies and be off due north , in a direction which the English would not anticipate , because such a move would carry them directly into English lines . De Groot had a plan for what would follow . Sounds possible , ' Van Doom said . You would n't want a force much bigger than ours , ' De Groot said enthusiastically . We 'll need expert scouting . ' I 've thought of that . We 've got to know exactly where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Micah proved himself a good scout , always moving with caution . One morning he haltered his pony far beyond English lines while he slipped around sentries , entering boldly the small town upon which the British were centered . Moving freely , he estimated the size and character of the forces , making shrewd guesses as to the length of time they expected to remain in this favorable location . He stayed in town two days , losing himself within the black population , several of whom guessed his identity ; they did not betray him because they were indifferent as to which side won , and if he was to be well rewarded for his mission , they were pleased . When he regained his pony , satisfied that he knew fairly well the disposition of the army men , he rode south and toward the west to where the cavalry were billeted , and now he faced a much more difficult problem . Again tying his pony at a distant spot , he set out on foot to approach the camp , but this time there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masking himself among the blacks . He had to move from hillock to hillock , running always the risk that a sortie from the barracks would sweep out across the veld on some practice mission and find him spying upon them . So he moved with extreme caution until he came within some two hundred yards of the lines where the mounts , big Argentinian horses , were tied . There were more than he had ever seen before , a massive command . The Boers are in trouble , he thought as he studied the fall of the ground , but General de Groot knows what he 's doing . He had doubts about his own wisdom when a contingent of young men left their tents , sauntered over to their horses , and casually mounted . After tightening straps , they waited for the arrival of their officer , who came at last on a striking red horse much larger than the others . What a fine animal , Micah thought as he watched what had to be a development of considerable danger .  |p670  Heh ! ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined up behind him . Using his bare right hand instead of the saber which he kept at his side , he indicated the direction his sortie was to make , and Micah saw with dismay that it would be headed in his general direction . He flattened himself between two rocks that provided some cover . A bugle sounded and the men came forth . They rode to within thirty yards of where he hid , not one of them looking right or left ; since this was a practice session , they felt no need to stay alert , but suddenly they stopped , looked in his direction , and burst into laughter . For one awful moment he thought they were preparing to lance him as a fixed target , but then he heard at some distance a slight scratching sound . Three little meerkats had come out of their burrows to look at the horsemen , and when one of the men made a lunge at them , they scampered . One of the men shouted , Bravo , Simmons . Stick three little Boers like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' When they continued their canter they headed right into the area where Micah had left his pony , and he expected at any moment to hear a Halloo ! ' There was no cry , and after a long while they galloped back to their camp . He breathed deeply when he saw that they had no pony with them . Because of his careful scouting he was able to inform General de Groot precisely as to the nature of the two bodies of men : The soldiers will be there for many days . The cavalry horses stand at the edge of the veld , the men 's tents behind them . They expect an attack from the other side , where the Boers are supposed to be . ' The Venloo Commando did not form a line as they set out on their mission ; they straggled over the veld in positions from which each man could dash forward or retreat according to his own judgment . They were engaged in a perilous effort and knew that maximum mobility would be essential . Slowly they covered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that held the two English contingents . Finally they reached a spot some six hundred yards from the cavalry camp , and here they dismounted . Guard the horses , ' General de Groot told his blacks , and they were left behind ; that is , all stayed with the horses except Micah Nxumalo , who crept forward with the commando to guide his general to where the enemy horses rested . It was now dusk . Keeping low , they stooped and scurried from rock to rock across the veld , zigzagging their way till they were close upon the English encampment . They would hold these positions for at least six hours during this fine summer night , during which they must not talk or smoke . Insects attacked and there was a good deal of scratching , but in general the men remained silent . Stars appeared , and the moon , and in the distance a hyena grumbled , then laughed . Familiar constellations climbed to their apex and began their leisurely descent , and over the camp silence reigned . At midnight  |p671  some cavalrymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , and bade each other a good rest as they separated . Sssst , ' De Groot signaled , and his six followers crept forward . They were on a mission which disturbed some of them , for the butchery they contemplated went against the grain of farmers , but a chain of recent defeats had impressed upon them that they were engaged in a struggle which would not end in truce ; one side or the other was going to be totally defeated , and it had better not be the Boers , for the penalties they would pay in lost freedom and even the loss of their republics would be terrifying . They must do what had to be done . So as they approached the encampment , De Groot touched those nearest him , saying nothing but indicating that he expected them to perform their tasks . Some of the men brushed his hand with theirs ; others simply nodded in the darkness . When they were within ten yards of the horse corral , he leaped forward boldly and his men followed . Three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Others grabbed the bridles of seven big horses saddled for emergencies and led them outside . General de Groot and Jakob moved methodically to the line where the officers ' choice mounts were kept and shot them methodically , one after another , killing them in most cases , immobilizing them permanently in others . There was no panic , no hurry when bugles began to sound , only the piling of inflammables and the striking of matches . Before any English cavalryman could get to the stores , they were ablaze and dark figures were riding away . What infuriated the Englishmen as they rushed onto the scene , powerless to retaliate , for their horses were gone , was that in the light from leaping flames they could see Boers on horseback , galloping among the free horses and shooting them down . God ! ' one young officer cried . They 're shooting the horses ! ' In rage he began firing at the retreating Boers , and although everyone knew that the invaders could not be reached , the entire cavalry contingent blazed away at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down . When dawn came , both the Englishmen and the Boers realized that the remainder of . this war was going to be excessively ugly . An inhuman act , ' General Kitchener cried when he saw the dead horses . No civilized man would do such a thing . ' He had no right to be sensitive about what civilized men would do or not do ; in the fiery battle that had led to the surrender of General Cronje and his four thousand Boers , a critical moment had come when the English line seemed to be wavering . It could be stabilized only by some drastic action which would command the attention and respect of all . Kitchener had seen the solution . Cavalry , charge up the center , and even if you do not reach the Boer laager , blaze away at them . ' Sir , ' the Scottish commander of the horsemen protested , that would be suicidal . '  |p672  Kitchener stiffened . He knew that by ordinary standards the order was insane , but this vast battle was not ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Scotsman saluted briskly . Very well , sir . ' He realized that if he disobeyed , he would be court-martialed and perhaps shot , but he also knew that if he obeyed , two hundred of his best men would be slain . He solved the problem in a heroic way . Turning to the brigade , he said , ' Retire twenty paces and regroup . ' To his four officers he said , ' Return to camp and fetch us more ammunition . ' When all were safely behind him , he turned to face the distant enemy and started riding slowly toward the laager , as ordered . On and on he came , far ahead of his men , riding on a tall white horse that stepped forward with stately caution . Suddenly he spurred his horse and ranged forward , closing upon the enemy guns , well hidden behind bulwarks , and it became apparent to both the English and the Boers what he was doing . He was obeying orders . He had been told to charge , and he was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to carry his men to their death . There was a hush , and then he whipped out his sword , tilting it at the proper angle , and as his handsome animal leaped forward he bellowed , Charge ! ' Boers , watching him gallop into the muzzle of their guns , could not bring themselves to fire , but one burgher who had read Sir Walter Scott understood the traditions of chivalry and knew that from such a charge there would be no retreat , nor any place in English life after such insubordination . Fire ! ' this man shouted , but no one responded . Fire , ' he cried again , we must help him , ' but once more there was awed silence . But when the rider was almost to the guns , the burghers opened fire at him , and he fell dead . For General Kitchener to order a Scottish officer and his men to certain death was warfare ; and as a consequence of such discipline , he had been enabled to destroy General Cronje ; but for Paulus de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitchener 's words : A show of barbarism , an inhuman act of madness outside the rules of civilized warfare . ' From now on , the war would be marked by many inhuman acts , but it would depend upon which side was speaking as to where the inhumanity lay . The English attitude was well summarized by General Kitchener : Damnit all , stands to reason , what I mean . Why do n't they dress in khaki , like a proper army , so you can see them , and get down off those damned ponies and fight like men ? What 's all this hitting a man and then running away  --  are they cowards , or what ? The damned Wogs fought better than these fellows . The lot of them need a proper hiding . ' General Roberts , a more temperate man , objected to three things about the Boers : They do n't obey their commanders , so it 's impossible to make a truce with them . They lack discipline , so you never know what they 're apt  |p673  to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , but they are careless , very careless indeed about the use of the white flag . ' When asked by a correspondent from a Paris newspaper what he meant by this , he sought to avoid controversy and remained silent , but when others pressed him , with their pencils ready , he said bluntly , They approach you with the flag . Lull you . Then drop it and are back in the battle . ' Certainly not , sir . ' I saw it with my own eyes . I 've had various reports . Could n't believe them . After all , these are decent human beings . But at the Battle of Driefontein , I watched as they did it . ' What Kitchener objected to , and most strenuously , was the Boer habit of ransacking the bodies of dead English soldiers and appropriating articles of needed clothing : The ghouls appear in our khaki . At fifty paces ca n't tell they 're enemy . That 's breaking the rules of civilized warfare . ' The English leaders made a great fuss over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy should behave much like the barefoot Indians and Egyptians : stand in line with their rusty guns ; wait as the phalanx of red-coated battalions marched at them ; fire ; run when the cavalry charged ; surrender and go back to their land when the war was declared over . It was disturbing to think that men of European heritage would fight the way the Boers did , with trickery , speed , and the nasty habit of dissolving back into the landscape instead of surrendering . And the fact that these Boers were well supplied with the best German Mausers and French Martini-Henri rifles was distressing . But the Boers , too , had their grievances . Like General de Groot , they felt it to be inhuman and far beyond the principles of civilized warfare for men to sit astride big horses  --  like those from the farms of America and the Argentine  --  and to ride them in among the commandos , cutting and slashing as they came . Hundreds of Boers , who started with no more than sullen resentment against the English , grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when De Groot and his men destroyed the Argentine horses they applauded . Even worse they deplored the English habit of firing their guns at two hundred yards , and then a hundred , and then fifty , and finally charging in with bayonets , a weapon the Boers never used . To come at a man with cold steel , ' De Groot said , that 's inhuman . ' Many an Englishman who should have been captured and led away to safe imprisonment lost his life because he fought with a bayonet , for Christian men did not do that . Between the combatants a kind of chivalry did exist , based on real respect : the English were redoubtable foes , willing to absorb tremendous losses ; the Boers were often willing to go up against unbelievable odds , and many of the most unusual gestures of courtesy were extended by these rude farmers . But on two points of difference they were adamant , and when the English refused to concede on these , a deep bitterness was engendered , with each side actually flogging and shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , concerned black troops ; each side used African scouts , but increasingly those with the English turned up with arms , whereupon word would flash through the countryside : The English are arming the Kaffirs . ' This was intolerable , for no matter how desperately the two white armies fought each other , in the backs of their minds the real enemy was the black man watching from the side . English commanders were aware of Boer feelings on this point , but that did not prevent them from enlisting and arming Coloured units from the Cape , and for this the Boers would never forgive them . Besides , for the English to use these Coloureds only deepened the Boers ' resentment of the fact that so few Afrikaners from the Cape volunteered to help . Many still hoped for a massive rebellion against the English in the two colonies , Cape and Natal , but no more than thirteen thousand crossed over . What was especially galling , thousands of Cape citizens of Dutch ancestry joined men of English descent in colonial regiments which fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north would die hating their brothers in the south for this treachery . The other Boer grievance was less complex . Because of their stern religiosity , they tried to avoid any activity on Sundays , and once during a protracted engagement , when General de Groot had his men at Sunday prayer , their guns silent , one of the Venloo men rushed into the service , shouting , They 're playing cricket ! ' De Groot stalked to a vantage point and looked through his glass at the green field upon which the English officers were having a merry game . He was appalled at this sacrilege and ordered a heliographer to send a message commanding the game to halt , this being the Sabbath . When the English signaled back the score , Eighty-seven for three wickets , ' he fell into a dark fury and ran breathlessly to a large gun . Fire on them ! ' When the Creusot monster was loaded and aimed he cautioned : But not too close . ' The shell landed well off the cricket field and killed no one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell had to be launched , and this came so close that the young men flew helter-skelter . When white-flagged emissaries came to protest the breaking of a tacit truce , De Groot replied , On Sundays you are to pray like us , not play at cricket like heathens . ' This matter of religion always perplexed De Groot and Van Doom . They knew they were men dedicated to God and were convinced that He looked after them with special regard ; they also knew that since the English were indifferent to the Bible , God must despise them , yet there were contradictions , as De Groot pointed out in a report to the council : I can not understand it . The English have what they call a chaplain attached to every unit , and braver men I have never seen . To aid a fallen comrade or give last prayers to a dying man , they will cross open areas of gunfire with such fortitude that our men sometimes cheer them in admiration . But we Boers , who live and die under a  |p675  special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a pistol shot goes off . Our spiritual welfare was being looked after by Predikants Nel and Maartins , but not for long . As soon as the first gun fired , both these dominees quickly found that commando life was not for them . No member of my commando felt their loss , as we provide our own prayers . One bitter point was never discussed in public ; it appeared in no news dispatches from the front , but it caused the harshest animosities , as General de Groot learned one morning when his commando captured six Englishmen . The young officer , a blond lad from Oriel College with his first commission , protested grievously : Sir , why do you Boers stoop so low as to use dumdum bullets ? ' De Groot did not change his expression . Did we use them ? ' Yes ! Yes ! ' the young man cried in near-hysteria . Chalmers was struck in the jaw . Should have been merely a nasty wound . Dumdum expands , makes a mess of his head . Atkins hit in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whole belly . ' When De Groot made no response , the young fellow shouted , It 's monstrous , Meneer . ' Quietly De Groot nodded to Van Doorn : Hand him three . ' And from a special pouch Jakob produced three dumdum bullets , tossing them into the young man 's lap . The Englishman studied them and blanched . In consternation he looked at De Groot and asked , Is this correct , Meneer ? Our own Woolwich Arsenal ? ' Tell him where we got them , ' De Groot said , and Van Doorn said , You heard about our raid against the cavalry ? The seven big horses we kept ? Those bullets you hold came from this pouch , found attached to one of the saddles . ' The young man apologized : They were intended for the Afghan frontier . Not for civilized warfare . ' In the autumn of 1900 such incidents receded in importance , for the massive strength of the English began to tell . They now had about two hundred fifty thousand men in the field against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way that the few , however gallant , could continue to hold off the many . With bold yet carefully prepared strikes , Generals Roberts and Kitchener rolled their choicest troops across the veld to Johannesburg and Pretoria . Town after town fell to the Tommies , and on the seventeenth of May even the tiny settlement at Mafeking was relieved at the end of a siege which had lasted interminably . General Robert Baden-Powell , who had used his scouting tactics to keep the town alive , was hailed throughout the world as a proper hero , and his manly deportment gave the English troops added courage as they headed for Johannesburg , which they captured on 31 May 1900 . Now came that most popular of all war songs , and in many ways the best , We 're Marching to Pretoria . ' Thousands of men chanted this as they closed in upon the Boer capital , and their triumphant voices could be  |p676  heard as a last railway train left Pretoria on its solemn way down the line that led to Lourenco Marques in Mocambique . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in Car 17 that gloomy day rode Oom Paul Kruger in desperate flight . It took the English only five days to capture Pretoria ; it fell on 5 June 1900 , and the great Anglo-Boer War was almost over . There was such joy in England that the police feared rioting , and families which still had sons in Africa  --  and there were many of them  --  wept openly to know that their boys would now be coming home . There was a little mopping up to be done . General Roberts did not want to leave for London until the last railway line was in his hands , for that would mean that any further resistance , even from guerrilla units like Paulus de Groot 's dwindling commando , would be impossible . Like the good soldier he was , the little one-eyed genius refrained from announcing victory until President Kruger was driven completely out of South Africa , and to achieve this , he proposed that he and Kitchener march east along the railway while General Buller come up from the south to close the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Roberts from the north begged Buller in the south to speed up his approach , and to each the Ferryman of the Tugela replied with faultless logic , explaining why he could not move a whit faster . When Roberts sent an English colonel to find out what in the world was restraining this warrior , it fell to Major Saltwood to escort him , and as the two officers inspected General Buller 's operations , Frank became even more aware of the considerable change that had taken place in his estimate of Buller . For example , the visitor exploded at the number of wagons in the train , saying , My God ! We 're in the closing stages of a war . He ought to abandon four-fifths of these and gallop north to help us . ' Now wait ! ' Saltwood replied defensively . Buller moves slowly , but I 've observed that he accomplishes his missions with minimal losses of men . No general protects his troops the way this old man does . ' But at what cost ? He refuses to take chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But watching him in action ? ' What action ? Know what they 're calling him at headquarters ? Sitting Bull . ' The colonel laughed heartily at the mess-room joke . Saltwood stiffened . Sir , we have a dozen funny names for the old fellow . But do you know what his men call him ? John Bull . ' The colonel was not impressed , but when he challenged Buller about his excessive wagons , all he got was a harrumph : Damn me , man , troops ca n't march forward with empty bellies . ' General Roberts says you think too much about your men . ' No general ever lost a battle because he defended his men . ' When you began this campaign , ' the colonel pointed out ungraciously , you promised it would be over by Christmas . That was last Christ ' mas , sir .  |p677  Buller showed no resentment . Squinting his tight little eyes beneath the brooding visor , he said simply , Damn-fool statement . Made it before I 'd met the Boers in battle . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . ' The rest of his rebuttal was lost in his monstrous mustache . The formal meeting accomplished nothing , but when Buller withdrew , mumbling to himself , Saltwood remained with the colonel . In our march north I 've seen a remarkable man at work . Victory after victory , with almost no casualties . He seems to have an uncanny sense of what his men can do , where they should strike . ' At Spion Kop he was a disaster . ' At Spion Kop he relied upon General Warren . Now he relies on himself . ' Are you defending Sir Reverse ? ' I am . He 's no Roberts , flying off all over the place . He 's no Kitchener , blustering into cannon fire . He 's an elderly general with a smart sense of warfare and a devotion to his men . ' Buller proved this in an embarrassing way , for in the hearing of the visiting colonel he said , Saltwood , we 're facing the final push . Go down to Trianon and fetch me five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it does taste good at the end of a long march . And fetch some beer for the men . ' When the two junior officers were alone , the visitor said , ' He never took a long march in his life . ' I can assure you of one thing , ' Saltwood said . On the day of victory , Old Buller will be the one marching in . Not fast , mind you . But very steady . ' And when the sneering colonel had departed , Frank realized to his amazement that he had grown to love the Ferryman of the Tugela , for Redvers Buller , with his squinting eyes and eggplant head and telescope between his toes , knew what war was , how it should be fought , and how it could be won . When he reached the Trianon vineyards to commandeer the best part of their bottling , Saltwood found that his wife had come east from Cape Town to share a few days with him , and from her he learned that the war had taken a dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worried : Frank , do you think General Roberts is justified in this move ? ' It 's brilliant . Two armies concentrating on the last railroad the Boers have . It 'll end the war . ' I do n't mean the railroad . I mean the scorched earth . ' He would always remember that she was incredibly beautiful as she first uttered these words : the sunlight of Trianon fell on her auburn hair , outlining the wondrous curls and twists she used for controlling it , and her eyes glowed with that intensity she had shown when first he met her . War and deci-  |p678  sions were forgotten as he leaned over to kiss her , but after a kind of mutine compliance she returned to her concern . ' Yes , he 's given orders to the burghers : " Lay down your arms or we will burn your farms and devastate your fields . If you fight , you will starve . " ' She took a deep breath . ' Really , Frank , is that decent warfare ? ' ' Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , they break out there . I had n't heard of the new order .. She produced a copy , signed by General Roberts , and he saw that she had reported it correctly . ' Looks sensible to me . We 've defeated them , you know  --  totally defeated them  --  and these regulations apply only to the scattered remnants . ' ' But they sound so barbaric . They do n't sound like my England at all . They sound like Genghis Khan . ' ' These are the mopping-up days of the war , Maud . We 're gleaning the last sheaves . ' ' Then why are you here buying wine for your stupid general ? ' ' Maud , he 's not stupid . He 's a man who knows exactly what he 's doing , although I did n't used to think so : ' But why the wine ? ' Her chin tilted forward , and the hardness which she could command when confronted by stupidity showed itself . Frank became irritated by her questioning and blurted out : ' Because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he does so because he 's the nephew of a great duke , who gives him the money to spend as he sees fit . he secs fit to buy champagne , that 's why . ' It was a silly answer and he realized this as soon as the words were spoken . ' It 's been a long , trying year , ' he said . ' But I 've grown fond of Old Buller , and you 'd be ashamed of me if I deserted him now . ' ' I 'm sorry if I spoke harshly , ' she said with such sweet innocence that he had to embrace her , but even as he kissed her , she returned to her concern : ' Is General Buller burning farms ? ' ' He could never do that . He fights armies , not women and children . ' ' But it 's an order . From Roberts . ' Frank laughed . ' I 've learned one splendid lesson from Buller . If a stupid order comes down , ignore it . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's a wonderful , bumbling old fool , who has more sense of warfare than all the others . He 'll fight this war his way , with good food , and sparkling Trianon , and plenty of rest for his men . And do you know what ? In the end he 'll win . ' On his side of the battle lines , General de Groot was encountering difficulty . Despite an occasional dashing sortie like his attack on the English cavalry , he was so stuck in routine that more of his commando had , left him to affiliate with larger units engaged in the serious efforts of the  |p679  war . The Venloo Commando now consisted of the general himself and ninety horsemen , plus their blacks . To keep it any longer in existence was ridiculous , and one afternoon the council told him so . Standing before his men in his double-breasted frock coat  --  tattered and ruined , its silver buttons gone  --  and his tall top hat , he was a forlorn figure , a fat old man of sixty-eight whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join Tobias Brand 's commando . ' We 're ninety men ! ' Van Doom protested . We can still fight as a unit . ' No . We must obey orders . Our commando is no more . ' But it would be humiliating  --  to take orders from someone else , after you 've been a general . ' Not to me . I do n't care where I fight . ' He summoned Sybilla , and in the presence of his men , said , Old lady , they tell me I must surrender my command and fight under Tobias Brand . ' He 's a good man , ' she said . I 'll fetch the wagon . ' But when they rode over to Brand 's camp , with Van Doom sharing the wagon , the younger general said , You understand who 's in command ? ' And De Groot said , You are , Tobias . ' Now Brand objected to having Sybilla along , for she was much older than the women in his commando , but Paulus pleaded : This beaten wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side for sixty years . ' So she resumed her position at the rear of a column , this one commanded by a stranger . On hot days when she could shoot an antelope she would make biltong for the long treks that she knew lay ahead . Anyone who looked even casually at the map of South Africa could see what the strategy of the English forces had to be , and De Groot listened as the combat generals explained what they must do to keep the Boer republics alive : The railroad to Lourenco Marques is our only link with the world outside . It must be kept open . We 've already lost it east of Pretoria , but we dare not lose this part . ' A brief flick of the finger indicated all that remained : only the area between Middleburg and the Portuguese border , including the two remarkable villages of Waterval-Boven ( Above-the-Waterfall ) and Waterval-Onder ( Under-the-Waterfall ) , for here in the space of a few miles the whole face of Africa changed . The Elands River , coming down off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , creating a beautiful tumbling waterfall from which the villages took their names , but this was not the spectacular character of the place . Waterval-Boven , at the edge of the high plateau , was a typical veld settlement , with harsh landscape , wide stretches of almost barren land and a forbidding aspect . Then came the plunging drop , and at WatervalOnder one was in the lush lowlands , with high humidity , twisting vines and a richness of grass and tree that was startling . In the winter of 1900 , when the Transvaal republic was falling apart , the two Watervals became the focus of world attention , for to the high one came Oom Paul Kruger , seventy-five years old , stooped and weary , a president losing his country . From his railway carriages , he tried to hold  |p680  his nation together , wincing when he learned that districts upon which he had depended were gone . He had not wanted to leave Pretoria and was especially grieved at being forced to abandon his old wife , but here he was near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to see him and spoke reverently of his accomplishments in the past : Oom Paul , we 're near the park you set aside for the animals . The lions and giraffes send you thanks . ' Little help you voracious men gave me in arguing for the park . All you wanted to do was shoot elephants for their tusks . ' When General de Groot came by to pay his respects , Kruger said , I hear you 're keeping Sybilla with you . Splendid idea , Paulus . Boer women thrive on battle . ' You and I are the only ones left who were in the Great Trek , ' Paulus said , and tears came into his eyes as he recalled those days . Was n't Mzilikazi a fearful enemy ? ' Kruger asked . He fought us all day , killing and slaying , then prayed with the English missionaries all night , telling them how his heart bled for his people . ' The weary president shook his head , then added , I must say , I 've never cared much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot ? ' They use a different Bible , ' De Groot said . Kruger slapped his leg . I agree , Paulus . The Bible in English , i does n't sound the same . They do something to it . ' What will you do , Oom Paul , if the English come down the railway line ? ' They want me to go to Europe . To stir up the nations . Find allies for us in our struggle . ' As the two old Pauls spoke , a cadre of officers came to the railway coach to inform them of disturbing news : We 're taking you down to Waterval-Onder . Safer down there . ' At the new headquarters , De Groot was assigned the pleasant job of serving as a kind of liaison between the Boers up on the veld and President Kruger sitting in a small white house down among the tropical growth , where the air was soft and warm . But within days news of the war grew ominous : Oom Paul , General Roberts is coming at us along the railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And then Paul Kruger demonstrated just how deeply he believed in the covenant his people had made with the Lord . De Groot , I want you to help me draft a last message to your Venloo burghers , ' he said , and laboriously , but with a kind of grandeur in their hearts , the two old men , veterans of the Great Trek to freedom , lined out the message , parts of which would be memorized by the Venloo men t whom it was read : Burghers , in all ages the Craven Beast has had the power to persecute Christ . Today , when God 's nation put here by Him to defend the Word is assailed by His enemies , every man who loves God ; ' .  |p681  must rise to defend Him . The time is at hand when God 's people are to be tried in fire , and those who are true to the faith and fight on in the name of the Lord shall be received in Heaven and enter into everlasting Glory . To those who talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To those who are forced to lay down their arms and take an oath I say , Go in again at the first opportunity and continue fighting . ' And to all I say that we fight on the side of God , and He will surely protect us . Read this message to officers and burghers at every opportunity . When General de Groot took the message up to be copied and circulated , he learned that Waterval-Boven was in peril from approaching English forces . When he returned to Oom Paul 's little house , he stood for some moments among the trees , looking through the window at the bearded man who was about to lose the republic he had worked so diligently to bring into being , and tears started to his eyes , but he fought them back : Nou is nie de die tyd , De Grootl ( Now is not the time . ) Entering the room Kruger used as his office , he said brusquely , Oom Paul , you 've got to go . A ship will meet you at Lourenco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man said , but he went . In doing so , he created a profound moral problem for Boer historians . They would find it impossible to say flatly that in time of deepest crisis their president had fled his country , abandoning it to the enemy . They would devise all sorts of explanations , all kinds of justifications : He went to enlist allies . He went to represent us in foreign capitals . He took our gold to safekeeping . We sent him away , he did n't go . ' But the fact would always remain that history was replete with examples of other beleaguered leaders who had refused to quit their native lands in time of crisis  --  so many , that it had become the honorable tradition . When William the Norman invaded England , Harold the Saxon felt it incumbent upon him to resist , and he did , to the death . When the Muslims invaded Spain , the Spanish king held fast , and from a cave battled back . When Pizarro sacked the Inca empire , the Inca did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defend his land . Even in South African history , when Colonel Gordon surrendered Cape Town to the invading English , he felt it necessary in the tradition of military honor to commit suicide , which he did ; and when Marthinus Steyn , president of the Orange Free State faced utter defeat , he sent the English a telegram : We shall never surrender ! ' and he fought on with his commandos . It would be difficult to find another major example in which the elected ruler of a country abandoned it , and his old wife , and his trek companions , but Oom Paul Kruger did , and the explanations he gave while wandering futilely from court to court in Europe sounded hollow . For his strange behavior there might be political justification ; an effort did have to be made to keep his nation alive , and help from Europe might have been the only practical solution . But it is impossible to conjure up  |p682  any explanation as to why an old man like this would abandon his wife of many years . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pretoria , he wept . Boer intelligence , which was usually good because of a more intimate knowledge of the battle terrain , saw clearly what the English generals were up to : Roberts marches east along the railway line . Kitchener reinforces his rear . That 's the approach we must protect . ' What about Buller moving up from the south ? ' ' He never gets anywhere on time . You can forget that approach . ' So near Bergendal Farm the Boers fortified a big red hill upon which the security of their entire line depended . If that hill was captured , English cannon could destroy the Boer lines , and the war would be over . It was a formidable target , sloping sides leading up to a plateau about three acres in size and covered with huge scattered boulders , like an untidy playground of giants . It was held by one of the stoutest of the Boer units  --  a group of Johannesburg policemen , the toughest in the nation , who were prepared to die . With his bumbling instinct for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving belatedly as the battle loomed , saw that the big red hill formed the hinge of the Boer forces , and that if it fell , the entire enemy position must collapse . It looks like Spion Kop , ' he said as his heavy guns swung into position . But this time 1 ' 11 be in charge . ' So while Lords Roberts and Kitchener approached from the west with copybook tactics , Buller thundered ahead on his own and invested the hill . This time his tactics were impeccable , and while Roberts and Kitchener stared with mouths agape , his horde of naval guns blasted the hill with lyddite for three awful hours , blowing entire boulders apart . Then his men stormed the redoubt , slew most of the Johannesburg policemen , and fractured the Boer lines . It was the last pitched battle of the war , and when it was over , Buller wrote to his wife : Here I am , as happy as a pig . . . Today I have a very nice telegram from the Queen . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' army , which had got there before me , had missed the chance and had to sit looking on . What a beast I am ! ' Redvers Buller had won the war . In London there were fantastic celebrations . The old queen , fresh from her Sixtieth Jubilee , decided on her own that her personal friend , Lord Roberts , had been responsible for the victory . She insisted that he be elevated to the rank of earl , admitted into the Order of the Garter and promoted to commander-in-chief . As Field Marshal Lord Roberts , he received from a grateful nation a vast estate and a cash gift of ? , Ioo , 000 , a huge fortune in those days . He had brought the war to an end , and England rejoiced . But General Buller was not forgotten . As soon as the war ended he  |p683  was whisked aboard ship and hustled to England , where he was given a prestigious job in the military and a score of resounding state dinners , in which one city after another handed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's batons inscribed with the roster of his victories : Conqueror of the Tugela , Relief of Ladysmith , Hero of the High Veld . ' His picture in tight little battle cap appeared everywhere , and it was agreed that he was perhaps the finest fighting general that England had ever produced . Of course , some years later , when the facts of Spion Kop surfaced , all hell broke loose , and generals in the military establishment hounded him , charging him with lack of leadership . He was dragged before boards of inquiry , where his testimony was not inspiring . These attacks by envious rivals seemed not to worry him , for he surrendered none of the public acclaim which he adored , and to his home in the country came a constant queue of men who had fought under him in South Africa to assure him that he was the finest general they had ever known . As one conscripted soldier told the press : When you fought under Buller , things went slower , but you did eat well . ' On the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earl and a Knight of the Garter , a group of tired flop-hatted Boers met secretly at a farm west of Pretoria . Louis Botha was present , Koos de la Rey the brilliant improvisator and Paulus de Groot the bulldog , and a brilliant young fellow all ice and steel , Jan Christian Smuts . They had no settled government , no railway line to the outside world , no guaranteed arms supply , no replacement of horses , no system of conscription to fill their ranks , and no money . They were as defeated a group of men as military history provided ; they had been mauled and chased almost off the continent , but there was not one among them prepared to put his hands up . The situation is this , ' Louis Botha said . Lord Kitchener has two hundred thousand men in arms right now . And he can get two hundred thousand more . We have maybe twenty thousand burghers in the field . That 's twenty-to-one against us , plus their ships , their heavy guns , the support of their empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and determination . ' For some hours the discussion continued , and there was still not a leader there who was not ready to continue the conflict perpetually against the English . They drafted plans which only a fool would have accepted , and they applauded the daring . When someone said , The sensible thing to do is attack Cape Town ; that will encourage the Cape Dutch to join at last , ' four different conunandants volunteered to undertake this incredible mission . The bulk of Kitchener 's force will have to play policeman , ' Botha  |p684  predicted . He 'll need a hundred thousand , maybe two hundred thousand , just to hold on to what they think they 've got . ' On and on went the wild discussion , until a listener might have thought that these were victors planning their next campaign , and as they talked and encouraged one another , the tremendous determination of these Boers manifested itself : Our women will be with us . Our children will find a way to help . ' Paulus de Groot took no part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he jammed on his worn top hat , fastened his coat with the two safety pins that had replaced the lost silver buttons , and said , The battles are over . Now the war begins . ' It began with an action that reverberated around the world . It would have been a remarkable adventure had General de Groot done it alone , but it so happened that two newspapermen , a Frenchman and an American , hearing of the dissolution of the commandos now that the war was over , sought out old De Groot , thinking that he would provide a colorful story : the old veteran of the Great Trek who had fought first as a general , finally as a mere private . Also , since he had long ago been one of the heroes at Majuba , his return to civil life would be interesting to older readers . But when they found De Groot and asked their first battery of questions about the impending surrender , he looked at them in amazement . Can you men ride horses ? ' We can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Good , because I do n't like heroes . Ride with me and see how we surrender . ' He had regrouped with ninety men , mostly from the old Venloo Commando , but including sixteen older burghers from other districts who had little to go back to and wanted a chance to twist old Kitchener 's tail . They had fine ponies and , of course , the usual complement of black retainers . They also had two wagons carrying three of the wives , and when the reporters saw Sybilla de Groot , in her sixties , they gasped . What 's she doing here ? ' I do n't go to war without my wife . ' But the war 's over . ' Only the preliminaries . ' When the newspapermen finally grasped De Groot 's plan of action , they were shocked both at the boldness and at the fact that a man nearly seventy should have concocted it . We want to give old Kitchener a signal that his war is still under way . He thinks he took over to receive salutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task ahead of him , and we want you to tell him so . '  |p685  If you do what you threaten , ' the Frenchman said admiringly , he wo n't need us to tell him . ' What De Groot proposed was to swing far west of Pretoria and Johannesburg , drop down some twenty-two miles below the latter city , and cut the railway line to Cape Town . Then , when English troops were everywhere , to gallop north as he had done before , right into the heart of their strength in Johannesburg district , there to cut the line again . Then , after a forty-six-mile gallop south , to strike the line again far from the first blow . Three nights , three directions , three strikes . It was confusing even to listen to ; for an English general basking in victory it would be appalling . Far out in the veld they left the two wagons and the spare ponies . As they prepared to ride in for their insane adventure , old De Groot took off his hat , kissed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . . . one day it will end . ' Casually , the Boers and the two correspondents rode east , calculating so exactly that at two in the morning , when guards were sleepy , they would have time in which to blow up the Johannesburg  --  Cape Town railway . They accomplished this with dispatch  --  a wild , violent eruption filling the night  --  then galloped at breakneck speed right toward the heart of Johannesburg , taking cover just before dawn . All that day they watched English troops hustling back and forth , In rather a panic , ' De Groot said . At dusk they stayed where they were , but well before midnight De Groot , Van Doom and Micah again led a dozen burghers up to the railway , lugging a huge supply of dynamite , which they fastened to the rails , detonating it from a distance . The explosion ripped the entire rail system apart , but before the debris settled , the Venloo Commando was galloping south over back roads to their third appointment . Again they spent daylight hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they resumed their riding . This time they galloped till almost dawn , when De Groot said , They wo n't expect us this far south . ' Calling upon his same team , he had one hundred yards of rail mined , and when the early dawn was shaken with the vast outburst , throwing lengths of rail high in the air , the Boers retreated out over the veld , then far north to where Sybilla waited with the wagons . The American reporter wrote a story which covered front pages in all states : WAR IS JUST STARTING SAYS DE GROOT . He was so factual and outlined the daring Boer strategy with such detail that the reader had to be impressed . When the report reached England a shudder passed through the nation , with editors asking soberly : WAS CELEBRATION PREMA-TURE ? But it was the French report that captured the world 's imagination , for it told of Sybilla waiting in the veld , of Paulus taking off his top hat before kissing her , of the unbelievable daring in riding right into English strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his men handled  |p686  their dynamite . What caused the story to be remembered , however , was the happy phrase the Frenchman coined to describe De Groot and his mission : AVENGER OP THE VELD . It sounded better in French ( Vengeur du Veld ) , but even in English it was telling , and its effect was reinforced by something that General de Groot had whispered on one of the night rides . He told me , ' read the report , that now that the gaudy battles are over , the real war begins . Having seen him in action for three Scheherazade Nights , I can believe it . ' Now the old man faced a different problem . All the adventurers wanted to join him , and the name Venloo Commando flashed across the world . Its struck in the north . It appeared out of the mist in the far reaches of then Orange Free State . Newspapers fought desperately to catch photographs of Sybilla de Groot driving her old wagon , or of her husband standing beside her with his tall hat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and fifteen , and finally the maximum he felt he could handle , with Van Doorn 's help : two hundred and twenty . They were the best riders , men who could load and fire at a gallop , i and they had no reason to halt anywhere , for they could not return to ! their homes . When Kitchener found to his grim dismay that the Boers did not intend to surrender , as a defeated rabble should , he became distraught and , issued orders that the farms of dissident commando members be burned to the ground , their fields ravaged and their livestock driven away : They may fight , but they wo n't feed . ' Before he left South Africa , Lord Roberts had applied this scorchedearth policy selectively , putting to the torch only those farms known to be collaborating with the commandos , but by the time Major Frank Saltwood was transferred from Buller 's defunct command to Kitchener 's , the practice had spread . I really do n't think it will have much bearing upon the burghers , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was adamant , and for the first time Saltwood saw the steel in this man 's fiber . Clean-shaven except for a distinctive mustache , trim , rigid , accepting no nonsense from anyone , he seemed the right man for the unpleasant task of cleaning up the few recalcitrant rebels like old Paulus de Groot . Shall we burn his farm ? ' an English aide asked , and before Kitchener could reply , Saltwood volunteered : That would be a mistake , sir . Already the man 's a hero . Simply create more sympathy . ' When these prudent words were spoken , Lord Kitchener stared at his South African liaison , trying to assess him : Is this man to be trusted to put England 's interest : first , or is he infected with local patriotism ? This time , however , what he says makes sense . Do not burn the De Groot farm , ' Kitchener ordered , and for the moment it was spared , but when the wily old man continued to strike at unforeseen places , making fools of the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not yet burn De Groot 's farm , he ordered a wide swath of desolation on either side of the railway leading to Lourengo Marques . As soon as this was done , the Venloo Commando swept in and cut the railway in four places , to the intense delight of the French correspondent who accompanied the raid . This was important , because the press of the world , especially the cartoonists , turned savagely against Great Britain , lampooning both her and Kitchener as murderers and bullies . Hardly a day passed that the influential papers in Amsterdam , Berlin and New York did not crucify Kitchener , showing him as a tyrant burning the food needed for starving Boer women and children . When one of the noble lord 's English aides saw a selection of the worst cartoons , he grumbled , Damned few of those great fat Duch women are starving . ' But the corrosive propaganda continued , until it appeared that the entire world was opposed to England 's performance in South Africa , as indeed it was , save for countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal ties to the mother country . The hero in this ceaseless barrage of pro-Boer propaganda had to be General de Groot  --  Vengeur du Veld and a cartoonist 's delight . He was an old man in a frock coat and top hat , and he was accompanied by a woman whose stately demeanor under all circumstances had won the admiration of all newsmen . Together they formed an irresistible pair , especially when an American photographer caught them holding hands beside their battered wagon . In London a brazen Cockney paperboy bought himself a stack of white envelopes , labeled them PORTRAIT OP GENERAL DE GROOT and sold them for sixpence . When the purchaser opened the envelope to find nothing , the cheeky lad cried , to the delight of those in on the joke , Damn me , Guv'nor , ' e got away again ! ' Who was chasing De Groot in these eight frustrating months of 1901 ? Instead of the troops going home at Christmas , 1900 , as Lord Roberts had said they would , some two hundred thousand had to stay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were added another two hundred forty-eight thousand , not all of whom were in the field at one time . De Groot had two hundred twenty men , but of course there were other equally insolent commandos operating ; however , the disparity between forces was both enormous and enraging . The vast numbers of English troops ought to have been able to catch the commandos , but they did n't ; old De Groot and his wife ambled their way right through the traps set to catch them . At one point when the summer heat was most unkind to the imported troops unaccustomed to the highveld , the following units , among many others , were striving to catch the Venloo Commando : from England , the Coldstream Guards ; from Scotland , the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders ; from Ireland , the heroic Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers ; from Wales , the Royal Welsh Fusiliers ; from Canada , Lord Strathcona 's Horse ; from Australia , the Imperial Bushmen ; from New Zealand , the Rough Riders ; from Tasmania , the Mobile Artillery ; from India , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Infantry ; from Burma , the Mounted Rifles ; from Gibraltar , the 1st Manchesters ; from Mauritius , the King 's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry ; from Egypt , the 1st Royal Fusiliers ; and from Crete , the and Rifle Brigade . Earlier in the war the Boers , too , had help from outside . Adventurers from all nations , believing themselves to be fighting for liberty against aggression , had flocked to South Africa , and one important French colonel died in their ranks . There was an Irish regiment always eager to take a thrust at the English ; a German and a Hollander contingent . Most tragic was a volunteer unit composed of one hundred and twenty-one idealistic Scandinavians , mostly Norwegian ; in one of the earliest battles of the war almost the entire force was exterminated . Such events were brilliantly reported , especially in the English press , for in addition to Winston Churchill , Rudyard Kipling came out to write about the conflict , championing the English cause in prose and verse ; Edgar Wallace was a frenetic legman ; Conan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrician restraint , and Richard Harding Davis the opposite ; Banjo Patterson , who would become Australia 's Poet Laureate with Waltzing Matilda , ' did excellent reporting ; and in the closing days quiet John Buchan looked things over . A strange assortment of visitors filtered in as observers ; Prince Kuhio , heir to the throne of Hawaii , appeared one day , and as the scion of a family always strongly proEnglish , was invited to the front , where he pulled the lanyard of a big gun , firing his blast at the hidden Boers . In August 1901 English pressure became so powerful that the Boer command decreed that wives must no longer ride with their husbands , and on a bleak hillside Paulus de Groot had to inform his companion since childhood that she must leave . She did not want to go ; that mean farm at Vrymeer was much less attractive to her than riding with her husband into battle . She had no fear of war 's rigors ; she wanted to share all things with Paulus , even though she suspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Paulus remained firm , she became disconsolate . You are my life , ' she said . It 's the others . They made the decision . You must go home . ' Where you are is home . ' The rides will grow more difficult . The lines tighter . ' Thinking that this might be the last time she would ever see him , she knew that she must not cry . Instead she broke into an infectious chuckle . Remember when we were married ? After the last battle with the Zulu ? And the dominee said in a loud voice , " Does any man know why this man and woman should not be wed ? " ' Good God , what a moment ! ' the general cried , and then he , too , laughed . And Balthazar Bronk , always a troublemaker for other people ,  |p689  shouted that the marriage was forbidden . That we had been raised as brother and sister . ' They stood silent on the dark veld , and then she took his hand and whispered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night at Blaauwkrantz , I loved you always . And I always will . ' De Groot tried to speak , but no words came . Get sleep when you can , ' she said , and they walked to the old wagon . He kissed her and helped her up , and she started up the hill . Paulus remained holding his hat as she climbed to the crest . He did not expect her to look back , nor did she , but when she was gone , he prayed : Almighty God , forget the battles for a while and look after that woman . When De Groot saw the first one , he shuddered . It was Lord Kitchener 's invention for ending the guerrilla war . It was perched beside a vulnerable stretch of railway track , a device of admirable simplicity . It was made of corrugated iron and looked like one of those circular Spanish barns called silos , except that it was squatter . It consisted of two iron cylinders , one fitted inside the other , with enough room inside to house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinders rocks and debris had been jammed to give both protection and insulation . The top was enclosed by a conical roof , so that from a distance the contraption resembled a heavy , blunt cigar jammed into the earth . Since the new device was obviously lethal and intended to halt the depredations of commandos , De Groot wanted to know as much about them as possible , and a man from the Carolina Commando , who had seen one after it had been blown up by a large force of dynamite , told all the burghers , Very difficult to destroy . Manned by seven soldiers . Three little beds . Place to cook . And some have telephones to the next blockhouse . ' As the commando looked down the tracks they had expected to dynamite , they saw six more of the blockhouses , cheap to build , easy to erect , and effective in breaking the open veld into manageable units out of which a mounted commando would have difficulty in moving . Look ! ' Jakob cried , and at the far end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one house to the next . Kitchener 's building a fence across Africa . ' This was correct . Goaded by ridicule , the commander had given orders that the railway system be protected by these new-style blockhouses , and when the first hundred proved successful , he called for eight thousand more , some of them built of stone . Once a commando found itself driven against one of the fortified barriers , its retreat could be so cut off that capture seemed inevitable . Not for Paulus de Groot . When he was trapped the first time , in southern Transvaal , there was no escape ; barbed wire flourished everywhere , but the English troops still had to fmd him . At the darkest moment  |p690  he told Van Doom , No army in the world ever found a way to keep all its enlisted men awake . Somewhere there 's a blockhouse sound asleep ! He sent Micah to test the line for a weak spot , but when the Zulu scout crawled back he reported : All manned . All awake . ' Try again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolated one iron fort in which all seven men seemed to be asleep . With a swiftness that amazed some of the commandos , De Groot , Van Doorn and Nxumalo crept up to the house , worked their way under the barbed wire , and rushed the loopholes four feet above the ground , pouring in a deadly fire , killing all the occupants . Within minutes the Venloo Commando were cutting the wires that had restrained them , and after they had regained the open veld , one newspaperman quoted De Groot : Lord Blockhead 's little toy houses cause us no worry . ' When cartoons across the world showed the noble lord playing with blocks while old General de Groot slipped away behind him , an enraged headquarters in Pretoria commanded : That man must be brought in . ' Regiments from eleven nations applied pressure , and once again the old man was trapped within a barbed-wire hedge , with Canadians , Irishmen , Australians and Welshmen closing in . This time he adopted a simple device : rounding up all available cattle from unburned farms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as the frightened animals piled up against the barbed wire , they simply carried it away , while the Venloo Commando swept off to freedom yet again . This time the cartoonists were merciless : ' LIKE ULYSSES . . . ' And they showed De Groot and his men tied to the bellies of the steers as they galloped past a sleeping Polyphemus who looked exactly like Lord Kitchener . All of them ! ' he thundered . I want all of them thrown into camps . ' So his men moved out to corral every woman and child belonging to the fighting Boers . They would be herded into camps of concentration , to keep them from feeding and supporting their menfolk . It was pointed out to Kitchener that there were already more than fifty thousand refugees in camps , many there at the behest of Boers themselves , for they had been unable to survive on farms without their men . I do n't care if there are fifty thousand more ! ' stormed Kitchener . When the drive against the commando-homesteads was well under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and farms and cattle , leaving only smoking ruins , Kitchener began to see good results . Three commandants , unable to survive against starvation and barbed wire , voluntarily surrendered , but before doing so their top men crept away to join up with General de Groot , whose forces now reached their maximum : four hundred and thirty hardened men , a hundred extra ponies and fifty blacks . This would be the final army , led by an old man approaching seventy . Pleased with the apparent effectiveness of the concentration camp , Lord Kitchener summoned Major Saltwood one morning and gave him an  |p691  order : Burn Vryrneer and herd the women into the camp at Chrissie Meer . ' Are you sure you want to do this , sir ? ' I am , ' the steely-eyed general said , and I deem it best if you lead the men , rather than an Englishman . ' I think of myself as an Englishman , sir , and I do n't relish assignments like this . ' I consider you a local , Saltwood . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seventy , including troops from various colonies , Saltwood rode east on the Lourenco Marques train , disembarked his horses at Waterval-Boven , and rode slowly south toward the lake  --  a journey he had taken in happier times . When he reached Venloo and saw the heavy price it had paid in this war , all windows shattered , a feeling of despair came over him , and he remembered what Maud had said that day at Trianon : Seems more like Genghis Khan . ' Then he turned west on the pleasant rural road leading to the lake , and when he crested the hill he could see the two farms at which he had once been so happy and so well received . It pained him to think that these good people had later considered him to be a spy , but he supposed , upon reflection , that he had been , in a general way of speaking . He did not want to go on , but when the men behind began to rein up near him he sighed and headed for the rickety buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they burn , ' a Welshman said . Sybilla was in the kitchen , and when she saw the troops she knew what to expect . Without saying a word , she packed a few belongings , reached for her sunbonnet , and appeared on the stoep . General Kitchener 's orders , ' a soldier said . Men , set the fires . ' In a way the flames were merciful ; they were erasing farm buildings that had long since served their day , and removing them was an act of good husbandry , but as the fire spread , Saltwood became aware of voices behind him , and turning , saw the four Van Doorn children : the girls Anna , Sannah and Johanna , and the handsome little boy Detlev . Sir , sir ! What are you doing ? ' one of the girls screamed . At this moment Major Saltwood chanced to look down from his horse and catch the eye of the oldest girl , Johanna , twenty-one years old , and he saw in her such hatred that he almost shuddered , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she had seen him before . She did not seem to remember , for which he was grateful . I suppose you 'll burn ours , too , ' she said through teeth that were almost clenched . My father rides with the general . ' Be gentle with the old woman , ' Saltwood shouted at his men as Sybilla was placed in a wagon . Gather the children . ' The three youngest were lifted up by soldiers and deposited beside her as the troop wheeled its horses and made its way to the Van Doorn farm  --  with Johanna walking grimly through the dust . This was no outmoded collection of shacks . It was one of the stoutest  |p692  farms in eastern Transvaal , a place of stone buildings and excellent rondavels for its blacks . To burn this would be to destroy the heart of a rich agricultural district . Burn it ! ' Saltwood said , but before the torch could be applied to the wooden parts that would ignite , a woman appeared at the kitchen door . What are you doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma'am . You 're to get in the wagon . ' That I will not do , ' Sara van Doom said , and when the Australians guarding the wagon relaxed their attention Johanna ran to join her mother . Together the two women blocked the entrance to the house . ' Remove them ! ' Saltwood commanded , and a detachment of Irish cavalrymen grabbed at the women , but they broke away and dashed into the house . When soldiers forced them out , the women carried in their arms the chief treasures of the Van Doorn family : Mevrou van Doom held the brassbound Bible ; Johanna , the ceramic pot in which her father made his bread pudding . A good fire was now burning in the shed , and one of the soldiers tried to snatch the book , intending to throw it in , but Mevrou van Doom struggled to retain possession , and there was a scuffle until Saltwood saw what was happening . Good God , man . That 's a Bible . Stand off . ' He was too late , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brutish soldier brought the butt of his gun around in a circle , caught the pot , and smashed it . When the dozen pieces tumbled to the boards of the stoep , it was apparent that a clever person with the right glue could reassemble the precious old thing , and Johanna stooped to gather some of the pieces , but this enraged the soldier , who brushed her aside and ground the remaining fragments under his boot . Stand back , you fool ! ' Saltwood cried , but as he did so he looked into the eyes of this embittered girl , and she remembered who he was : Mother ! He 's the spy . ' From her wagon , Sybilla looked out to inspect the man in charge of this destruction , and she , too , recognized him : The spy ! ' The twin girls , peering from beneath the canvas , saw who he was and they joined the lamentation : The spy ! He 's Saltwood the spy . ' When Frank dismounted to reassure the two Van Doom women on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have hanged you . ' They should have hanged you ! ' the twins shouted , and Detlev , finding sticks in the wagon , started throwing them at their betrayer . Meanwhile , the fires raged . It was only thirty-eight miles from Vrymeer to the cluster of large lakes which the English called Chrissie Meer . Here the concentration camp had been established , but in that distance Major Saltwood 's column had collected five additional wagons filled with women and children from farms en route . Since all buildings had been burned , the women were sooty and  |p693  weeping as they turned the last corner ; then they looked with awe at their destination . Their camp lay at the edge of one of the loveliest lakes in Africa : a surface shimmering in sunlight , hills rising softly from the shore , flowers in beds , and a hint of animals hiding in the glens . Saltwood said to a member of the Welsh Fusiliers , If you must have a prison camp .. . the clean air . . . the sunlight . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp echoed with shame , he would concede that it was at least a place of physical beauty . To it he delivered Sybilla de Groot , Sara van Doom and the four Van Doorn children , but as he did so he noticed by sheerest accident a tent in which three young children lay sleeping , he thought ; on closer inspection he saw that they were awake , too emaciated to respond when he spoke to them . Rushing to the commandant 's office , a doctor from the English Midlands , he cried , Sir , those children in the tent at the bottom of Row Eighteen . Sir , those children are starving . ' There is no starvation here , ' the doctor said sternly , as if reporting on his hospital to a village committee of inspection . ' But those children ! Legs like matchsticks ! ' We are all like matchsticks , ' the doctor cried , his voice suddenly rising almost to a scream , as if his earlier composure had been tenuous . And do you know why ? ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ; they were not used at officers ' headquarters . It 's your goddamned Lord Kitchener , that 's who it is . Go back and tell him what you saw . ' I ca n't leave my women here ... ' You 're right , Colonel . . . What 's your name ? ' Saltwood , and I 'm a major . ' English ? ' I 'm from the Cape . And I 'd appreciate your telling me where to take these women . ' Where ? Yes , where ? ' Doctor , lower your voice . You sound demented . ' I am demented ! ' the little man screamed in a Lancashire dialect . I am demented with shame . ' With a sudden swipe of his right arm , Saltwood knocked the agitated man against a wall , then pulled him up and sat him at his desk . Now tell me without bellowing  --  what 's the matter ? ' Typhoid 's the matter . Measles are the matter . And dysentery , dysentery 's the matter . ' He broke down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own face in compassion . Tell me in an orderly way , ' he said , touching the doctor 's shoulder . I can see it 's horrible , but what can we do ? ' The doctor jabbed at his eyes , rumpled through some papers , found a report , and covered it with his hands for a moment . We 're at the end of the supply line here , Colonel . Headquarters ca n't send us enough food . But the diet would sustain life , except for the incessant illness . ' And here  |p694  he repeated his litany of death : Typhoid , measles , dysentery . We could fight any one , but a body already weakened by stringent diet , it has n't the strength . These figures tell our story . ' And he shoved the paper forward . Deaths per thousand , months of February , March , seven hundred and eighty-three . ' My God ! ' Saltwood cried . Those were the bad months . Chrissie Meer 's average is usually less than three hundred . ' But even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' the doctor said . Of the thirty-seven women and children you delivered today , maybe fifteen , maybe twenty will be dead at the end of six months , if dysentery runs wild again , if the food supply weakens . ' Doctor , you are in very sore condition yourself . I think I should take you back to Pretoria . ' A nurse heard this proposal and stepped forward , an extremely gaunt woman . Dr. I-Iiggins controls his feelings most of the time . We all try to . And when we get fresh vegetables or meat from the countryside , we keep many people alive . But without medicines . . . ' She shrugged her shoulders . Dr. Higgins is a very strong man , spiritually . He does what he can . ' What do you need ? ' Saltwood asked . She hesitated , looked at Dr. Higgins , and saw that she would get no help there . He had withdrawn from the discussion . We need everything . Hospital beds . Medicines . We have no toilet paper . Dysentery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you saw . If we do n't get help soon , and I mean nourishing food in better supply , all the children you brought us will be dead . ' Two nights later , when he was back in Pretoria , he found that there were no additional supplies for Chrissie Meer , at the far end of the line : no extra food , no medicines , no sanitary aids , and he could see his chil- ' dren , the ones he had taken to the camp , dying . Retiring to his room , with dull anguish assailing him , he wrote a love letter : My dearest darling Maud , I have never before addressed a letter to you like this , because I did not appreciate how desperately I love you and how much I need you . I have been to Chrissie Meer , to the big concentration camp there , and I am shattered . You must do all you can to alleviate the condition of these pitiful people . Food , blankets , medicines , trained people . Maud , spend all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake and the reputation of our people , you must do something . At this end I shall do whatever I can . An evil fog has fallen over this land , and if we do not dissipate it promptly , it will contaminate all future relationships between Englishman and Boer . When I rode back from Chrissie Meer , I reflected on the fact that the three men who were spoilers of this land , Shako , Rhodes ,  |p695  Kitchener , not one of them had a wife . I fear that men without women are capable of terrible misdeeds , and I want to apologize to you for having allowed Mr. Rhodes to delay our marriage as he did . I was as evil as he in conforming to that hateful posture , and I bless you tonight for the humanity you have brought into my life . Your most loving husband , Frank When word circulated at headquarters that Maud Saltwood was creating disturbances  --  Not riots , you understand , but real annoyances , questions , and all that , you know ' ? Lord Kitchener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own men should be unable to control his wife , permitting her to make a fuss over the camps , where , as he pointed out again and again , the women and children are much better off than they would be in their own homes . ' Bring Saltwood in here ! ' he thundered . When the major stood before him he used his baton to indicate a pile of papers . What 's all this  --  these reports  --  about your wife , Saltwood ? ' She 's doing what she can to alleviate conditions ? ' Alleviate ? There 's nothing to alleviate . ' Sir , with all respect , have you seen the death rate ? ' Damnit , sir , do n't you be insolent with me . ' The noble lord looked as if he could bite Saltwood in half , and would relish doing so . You sit down there , and listen to someone who knows . ' He summoned a Dr. Riddle , from London , who had just returned from a tour of the forty-odd camps . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enthusiasm . With alacrity he took the report Lord Kitchener held out to him . I wrote this , you understand , Saltwood . Done on the spot . ' From it he read his major conclusions : The Boer women and children are noticeably better off than they would be if left on their abandoned farms . They receive adequate supplies of the most healthful foods , on which they seem to prosper and if ? ' ' Did you get out to Chrissie Meer ? ' Saltwood interrupted . Listen to the report , ' Kitchener snapped . I was n't able to get that far east , ' Dr. Riddle said . Whatever illness appears in the camps is due primarily to the Boer women themselves . Having been raised on farms without privies , they can not learn to adopt the sanitary measures which alone prevent the spread of epidemics . And when illness does strike , they insist upon resorting to country measures that have not been used in                 @ @ @ @
