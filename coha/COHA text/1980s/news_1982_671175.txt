Twenty years ago when the French ready-to-wear industry was growing up , the new designers were an iconoclastic group . Today , they have become part of the establishment , and the newer designers have returned to themes prominent before the revolutionary 1960 ' s. // // A Seductive Look // Most prominent is a seductive look based on closely fitted clothes that are far more constructed than women have been used to wearing in recent years . Snug waistlines , reinforced with wide belts , narrow skirts that bare the knees and elaborate , fussy accessories are characteristics of many of the new styles . Not only are they constricting , but also the clothes conform to earlier concepts of fashion that aimed at revealing some parts of the body while concealing others , with the main purpose to attract men. // Milan decided to become the fashion center of Italy in the mid-1970 ' s . Before that , Italian fashion was split between Rome and Florence . Instead of traveling to either of those cities , such Milanese houses as Missoni and Krizia decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized orderly showing dates and surprised everyone with colorful , casual clothes in the most luxurious materials , emphasizing silk and leather . A distinctive Milan look began to emerge. // It owed something to the informal style that was long associated with the New York look in that it was based on separates . Separates , or fashion based on interrelated components that can be changed around according to an individual ' s whim and taste , have long been a key component of sportswear . Sportswear has been widely regarded as the major contribution of the United States to the world fashion scene. // In recent seasons , however , the Milan collections have been approaching the formality of the French . They are somewhat diluted in that the best designers are responsible for other collections besides those that bear their names and appear to be spreading themselves too thin . The strength of the Milan market remains the superiority of the fabrics , the complexity of the colors and the facility with leather and knitted materials. // Some of the collections in New York also suffer the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French . The casual , relaxed look has been drawn in to the body and elaborately accessorized . Sportswear has been dressed up . One byproduct is the greater importance of the spring suit , which not too long ago seemed an endangered species. // Nevertheless , the New York shows are attracting an increasing number of European visitors . Store buyers in such countries as West Germany , Switzerland and Denmark find the casual New York style more appropriate to the requirements of their clients than the formal , restrictive clothes that typify the French offerings and the collections they infuence . <> <> A Return to Staples // London , which for a few years in the 1960 ' s ranked second only to Paris , has been quiescent , but may be on the way back . When the flurry of excitement spurred by the young fashion explosion in that decade died down , some designers didn ' t seem to know where to turn . But many are now returning to the staples of British fashion , such as quality woolens , which they spurned during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least two world-class designers , Jean Muir and Zandra Rhodes , and a number who are on the way up , such as Sheridan Barnett and Jasper Conran . Both are working in a realistic vein. // Poised for a major assault on Western fashions are the designers of Japan , who have just begun to organize themselves into a group , known as the Tokyo Collections . Some of its members have already made themselves known by presenting their collections in Paris . The group , which consists of 14 designers , has not yet decided whether to concentrate on inviting foreign visitors to Tokyo or to show collections abroad . The clothes , however , have a definite point of view and are quite different from anything presented in the West . It is perceived by many Western observers that the next major change in fashion will emanate from the East . <> <> Not Made in Standard Sizes // Among the many innovative features is that the clothes are not made in standard sizes . The same size blouse , for example , is planned to fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women ' s . The clothes are not at all structured , most can be folded to lie flat and the many crinkled fabrics do not require ironing . Wrapped and layered , they offer a sometimes violent contrast to the acutely fitted French styles. // They are not likely to take the world by storm when the first spring fashions begin appearing in stores in a few weeks . The emphasis will be on fitted jackets , slender skirts , belted waistlines and other accouterments of the style set by Yves Saint Laurent and other French leaders. // Clothes for the spring of 1983 have already been designed and ordered . New York designers are well into their collections for next summer , while those in other centers , who only show two collections a year , are beginning to think of next fall . It is not the designer but the consumer , however , who makes the ultimate decision on whether a proposed style becomes a fashion . It will be the reaction to the current collections that determines the future direction in design and the relative importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
