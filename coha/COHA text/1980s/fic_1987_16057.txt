EXT . AN OREGON HARBOR - ESTABLISH - DAY VARIOUS SHOTS : Local fishermen . Baiting their lines . Sitting in the sun . Kidding each other . We finally focus on TWO LOCALS , bearded lumberjack types carrying fishing nets , walking down the pier . They stop and and whistle in awe at the sight of A HUGE YACHT the S. S. Immaculata , glaringly out of place , docked among the tiny fishing boats . &nbsp; LOCAL #1Whoa-oh ! Whose little baby is that ? &nbsp; LOCAL #2Nobody we 're ever gon na know . &nbsp; LOCAL #1Could be tourists . &nbsp; LOCAL #2Huh ! What kind of re-tard tourists 'd stop here ? EXT . YACHT CABIN WINDOW We see the faces of JOANNA STAYTON and her husband , GRANT , peering disdainfully through the glass at the town . INT . YACHT CABIN It 's sumptuously furnished , with the kind of taste and elegance only New Yorkers enjoy . Grant Stayton , nautically attired , is a good-looking man , but somewhat anaemic  --  the virility has been bred out of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stunning blonde with severely laquered hair , turns away from the window in a cold fury . &nbsp; JOANNA ( in the haughty , imperious tone of a woman spoiled from birth ) Where .

From the bowels of the boat comes the asthmatic wheeze of an engine trying to turn over . &nbsp; JOANNAI do n't suppose it occurred to you to have the boat examined before we left ? &nbsp; GRANT ( testy ) Why should it ? ! This yacht has never once broken down , not once in 20 years ! &nbsp; JOANNAOr been serviced , apparently . ( pacing again ) Ugh ! I ca n't believe I was lunatic enough to go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; GRANT ( this touches a nerve ) This is the Stayton yacht , kings and Presidents have been entertained on this yacht , the least you could do is appreciate it --  &nbsp; JOANNAI 'd appreciate it a lot more if it had closet space .

BELOW DECK - ENGINE ROOM Joanna looks down at two CREW MEMBERS , up to their elbows in greasy engine . Overseeing this operation is ANDREW , the Stayton 's distinguished , 50-ish manservant . &nbsp; JOANNAAndrew , how much longer is this going to take ?  --  3  --  &nbsp; ANDREWDepending on the availability of parts . . . two days . &nbsp; JOANNA ( drawing herself up ) Excuse me ?

All right ? But I 'm going to require some sort of project .  --  5  --  &nbsp; GRANTProject ? &nbsp; JOANNA ( off his blank look ) Project . A productive activity . . . ? For me . . . ? To do . . . ? Section Details EXT . AN OREGON HIGHWAY - MORNING A battered old crew cab truck with non-existent shock absorbers goes bumping along the road . INT . TRUCK CAB - MOVING DEAN PROFFITT , the driver , a good-looking , rural charmer in his late 30 's , is singing rowdily along with the C&amp;W tune on the radio - one of those real weepers , dripping with self pity . Between his knees is a 7-11 styrofoam cup of coffee ; he munches a Hostess powdered sugar doughnut  --  breakfast . On the seat beside him , on the floor and all over the dash , is copious evidence that Dean is a father : a beach ball , toy trucks , kids ' books , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean pulls up to THE PIER and gets out of the truck , wiping the powdered sugar crumbs from his mouth and blinks in awe at the yacht .

GRANT 's face , twisted with paranoid terror , pops up like a Jack-in the-box from behind the railing of the boat . He brandishes a sterling silver candlelabra like a weapon . &nbsp; GRANT ( terrified ) Get back ! Get back or I 'll have to hurt you ! Dean is taken aback but hardly frightened . &nbsp; DEAN PROFITTUh . . . somebody call for a carpenter ? Grant slowly puts the candelabra down .  --  6  --  THE DECK OF THE YACHT Joanna and Grant stride across the deck , Grant at Joanna 's elbow , nervously peering back as Dean follows them . &nbsp; DEAN PROFITTI heard you got an emergency . . . ? &nbsp; GRANT ( as though Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEAN PROFITTUh . . . local references ?

You got an emergency ? We can do a blood test and a bunch of fingerprints right now , or I can just get started . Huh ? He smiles winningly at Joanna , but his charm , which is decidedly rural , escapes her . She looks at him coldly . &nbsp; DEAN PROFITTNow what seems to be the problem ? INT . CABIN OF YACHT - DAY Joanna holds open the door to an expansive closet . &nbsp; JOANNAWell , you can see how inadequate it all is. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe racks !

You want me to remodel a closet ? &nbsp; JOANNA ( patronizingly ) Is n't that what I 've been explaining in some detail ? Andrew appears , bringing a tray with some Perrier water , crackers and caviar . Without even acknowledging his presence , she spreads some on a cracker and takes a bite . &nbsp; JOANNAExcuse me ? What is this ? &nbsp; ANDREWCaviar , Mrs. Stayton . &nbsp; JOANNA ( weary with the world 's stupidity ) Must I specify , when I ask you to pack caviar , that it be good caviar , and not fish bait ? ! Or is that too great a leap ? ( turning back to Dean ) You have 48 hours . I suggest you get started . With that , she sweeps from the room  --  or almost sweeps from the room  --  the width @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Attempting to retain her dignity , she turns sideways and exits . Dean turns to Andrew , sympathetically . &nbsp; DEAN PROFITTYou always get that shit ? &nbsp; ANDREWOh , this is a good day . Section Details CU- THE CLOSET - A DAY LATER - 3/4 REMODELED Dean , shirtless , is working away quickly and efficiently . . . the closet looks greatly improved and it 's clear that he knows what he 's doing . His concentration is somewhat marred , however , by the imperious tones of Joanna wafting through the open window , from the deck outside .  --  8  --  &nbsp; JOANNA 'S VOICEHello , Dudley , this is Mrs. Stayton .

From inside the yacht cabin there is the CLUNK ! of heavy tools being dropped . . . INT . YACHT CABIN Dean , his tools on the floor , stands openmouthed at the prospect of that sum of money being bandied about . &nbsp; DEAN PROFITTJeeeesus . &nbsp; JOANNA 'S VOICE ( continuing ) Good , my card number is 012-359-9131 . No , it 's platinum , of course there 's no limit . . . this is Mrs. Grant Stayton ! I should hope so . There is the click ! of the receiver being replaced and the SOUND of approaching footsteps . Dean quickly returns to work as Joanna comes striding in . Now that we have a better look at her , we see what a flimsy piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so high we can even see a strawberry-shaped birthmark on her haunch . She puts her hands on her hips . . . she 's beautiful , imperious . . . and completely unaware that between Dean 's shirtlessness and her revealing suit there are two attractive , only partially clothed adults alone in a very small room .  --  9  --  &nbsp; JOANNAWell , the boat appears to be functioning , so I 'd appreciate it if you 'd stop eavesdropping and finish your . . .

Why are you amazed ? &nbsp; JOANNAOne would have hoped you 'd know that closets are cedar , otherwise , we get moths . &nbsp; DEAN PROFITTLady , there 's not a real big moth problem off the Pacific Coast . &nbsp; JOANNAThis discussion is pointless ; you 'll have to rip all this out . &nbsp; DEAN PROFITT ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want cedar ?

In answer , his tools come hurtling down into the water beside him . THE YACHT takes off . Section Details EXT . DECK OF THE MOVING YACHT Joanna throws that last hammer over the side , eyes full of tears . Though she 'd rather die than admit it to herself , Dean 's words hit a nerve .

TRAILER This is BILLY PRATT 's combined office and living quarters . Billy , Dean 's old friend , is a big , overweight , genial guy  --  not a world-beater for brains , but with a good heart . He sits hunched over a none-too-clean desk , drawing up some plans , as Dean angrily bangs the door closed . &nbsp; BILLY ( without looking up ) How 'd it go ?

CABIN OF STAYTON YACHT - NIGHT We PAN from the dresser , where we see , deposited , all of the jewelry Joanna was wearing in the previous scene , to THE BED , where she lies in a Camille-like pose , heating pad on her stomach , a snifter of cognac and a box of chocolates near at hand . Grant is in bed next to her , in a robe over pajamas , watching TV . &nbsp; JOANNAMust you run that thing ? &nbsp; GRANTYes , I must , it 's good for my nerves , it has a tawdry escapist quality . &nbsp; JOANNAWhat you have to escape from I can not possibly imagine .

Ugh . . . never mind , this is obviously asking too much of your energies . . . With a groan of hypochondria she rises from her sickbed . EXT . THE DECK - BY MOONLIGHT Joanna , in a diaphanous white robe and high heeled slippers ( seriously inappropriate deckwear ) appears , hair and robe sent immediately askance in the stiff nautical breeze .

DECK Still calling their names , Joanna watches angrily as the card slides still further from the railing . Heaving a sigh of monumental annoyance with her help , Joanna unfastens and opens the small gate to the unguarded prow of the ship . Then , with one perfectly manicured hand firmly grasping the rail , she steps out , retrieves her card , steps back through the gate , puts the card on the table , and , putting her hand to her collarbone , takes a deep breath at the scope of her exertions .

Yes , it 's Joanna on television . Dean and Billy get out , approach the window . &nbsp; DEAN PROFITTThat 's her ! &nbsp; BILLYThe bitch ? &nbsp; NEWSCASTER 'S VOICE ( faintly audible through glass ) Does this face look familiar to you ?

Annie looks around in wonder  --  123  --  at what she has helped to create . She turns back to Dean , flings her arms around him , and they begin to dance , swaying to imaginary music , and the kids pile into frame , hanging onto them , and dancing with them , and we PULL BACK , and BACK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to their celebration . . .
