IN LOVE WITH ARIADNE By William Trevor Images cluster , fragments make up the whole . The first of Barney 's memories is of an upturned butter box  --  that particular shape , narrower at the bottom . It 's in a corner of the garden where the grass grows high , where there are poppies and pinks among the stones that edge a flower bed . A dog pants , its paws stretched out on the grass , its tongue trailing from its mouth . Barney picks the pinks and decorates the dog with them , sticking them into his brindle fur . " Oh , you are bold ! " The hem of the skirt is blue , the shoes black . The hat Barney has thrown off is placed again on his head . He has a stick shaped like a finger , bent in the middle . It is hard and shiny and he likes it because of that . The sunshine is hot on his skin . There is a baby 's perspiration . Barney 's mother died three years after his birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the garden at Lisscrea there was Charlie Redmond to talk to , and Nuala was in the kitchen . " Dr. G. T. Prenderville , " the brass plate on the wall by the hall door said , and all over the neighborhood Barney 's father was known for his patience and his kindness  --  a bulky man in a tweed suit , his graying hair brushed straight back , his forehead tanned , a watch chain looped across his waistcoat . Charlie Redmond made up doggerel and twice a day came to the kitchen for cups of tea , leaving behind him a basket of peas or beetroot or whatever was in season . Because of the slanderous nature of his doggerel , Nuala called him a holy terror . William Trevor 's most recent book is The Silence in the Garden , a novel . Lisscrea House , standing by the roadside , was covered with Virginia creeper . There were fields on one side and on the other the Mulpatricks ' cottage . Beyond that was the Edderys ' cottage , and an iron gate that separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the cottages . Opposite , across the road , were the ruins of a square tower , with brambles growing through them . A mile to the west was the Catholic church , behind white railings , with a shrine glorifying the Virgin just inside the gates . All the rooms at Lisscrea were long and narrow , each with a different , flowered wallpaper . In the hall the patients sat on a row of chairs that stretched between the front door and the stairs , waiting silently until Dr. Prenderville was ready . Sometimes a man would draw a cart or trap outside , or dismount from a bicycle , and the doorbell would jangle urgently . " Always listen carefully to what 's said at the door , " Dr. Prenderville instructed Nuala . " If I 'm out , write a message down . " When Barney was seven he went to school in Ballinadra , waiting every morning on the road for Whelan 's cart on its way to Ballinadra creamery with churns of milk . The bread van brought him back in the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cycle  --  on Dr. Prenderville 's old Rudge with its saddle and handlebars lowered . " Up the airy mountain , " Miss Bone 's thin voice enunciated in the schoolroom . Her features were pale and slight ; her fingers stained red with ink . " There goes Miss Bone , " Charlie Redmond 's cruel doggerel recorded . " She 's always alone . " Miss Bone was tenderhearted and said to he in love with Mr. Gargan , the school 's headmaster , a married man . " Quod el-at demonstranclum , " Mr. Gargan regularly repeated in gravelly tones . On the Sunday before he made the journey to school on the Rudge for the first time , Barney found his father listening to the wireless in the drawing room , a thing he never did on a Sunday morning . Nuala was standing in the doorway with a dishcloth in her hand , listening also . They 'd have to buy tea , she said , because she 'd heard it would be short , and Dr. Prenderville said they 'd have to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an aeroplane . Charlie Redmond had told Barney a few days before that the Germans ate black bread . The Germans were in league with the Italians , who ate stuff that looked like string . De Valera , Charlie Redmond said , would keep the country out of things . The war that began then continued for the duration of Bamey 's time at school . Lisscrea was affected by the shortages that Nuala had antici-pated , and De Valera did not surrender the will to remain at peace . It was during those years that Barney decided to follow in his father 's and his grandfather 's footsteps and be-44 How 're the digs ? " Rouge Medlicott come the doctor at Lisscrea. asked , and the Pole , Slovinski , again beckoned the waitress  --  not because he required more coffee but because he liked the look of her . " Awful , " Barney said . " I 'm moving out . " When he 'd arrived in Dublin at the beginning of the term he found he had not been allocated a set of college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Dim Laoghaire . Greyhounds cluttered the stairs of this house and broke into a general barking on imagined provocation . Two occupied a territory they had made their own beneath the dining-room table , their cold noses forever investigating whatever flesh they could find between the top of Barney 's socks and the turnups of his trousers . Rouge Medlicott and Slovinski shared college rooms and at night pursued amorous adventures in O'Connell Street , picking up girls who 'd been left in the lurch outside cinemas or ice-cream parlors . " Why does n't she come to me ? " Slovinski demanded crossly , still waving at the waitress . " Because you 're bloody ugly , " Medlicott replied . Students filled the caf ? . They shouted to one another across plates of iced buns , their books on the floor beside their chairs , their gowns thrown anywhere . Long , trailing scarves in black and white indicated the extroverts of the Boat Club . Scholars were recognized by their earnest eyes , sizars by their poverty . Nigeriansdid n't mix . There were tablefuls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historians and linguists , geographers and eager divinity students . Rouge Medlicott and Slovinski were of an older generation , two of the many ex-servicemen of that time . Among these students were G.I. 's and Canadians and Czechs , a couple of Scots , a solitary Egyptian , and balding Englishmen who talked about Cecil Sharp or played bridge . " You meet inc tonight , " Slovinski suggested in a peremptory manner , having at last succeeded in summoning the waitress . " What about tonight ? " " Tonight , sir ? " " We 'll have oysters in Flynn 's . " " Oh God , you 're shocking , sirr cried the waitress , hurrying away . Barney had gotten to know Slovinski and Rouge Medlicott through sitting next to them in biology lectures . He did n't think of them as friends exactly , but he enjoyed their company . Medlicott had acquired his sobriquet because of the color of his hair , a quiff of which trailed languorously over his forehead . There was a hint of flamboyance in his attire  --  usually a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a bulky green tie . His shoes were of soft , pale suede . He was English and notably good-looking . Slovinski was small and bald and still wore a military uniform  --  a shade of blue  --  that Medlicott claimed he had bought in a lost-property office . Slovinski could play part of Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony on his teeth , with his thumbnails . " I heard of digs , " Medlicott said . " Out near the zoo . That Dutch fellow was after them , only he decided to go back to Holland instead . " It was in this casual way that Barney first came to hear about Gogarty Street , and that evening he went out to inspect the lodgings . A woman with an orange-powdered face and waved black hair , kept tidy beneath a net , opened the door to him . A discreet smear of lipstick outlined her lips , and there was a hint of eye shadow beneath her myopic-seeming eyes . She was wearing a flowered overall , which she apologized for as she removed it in the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blouse that had a fox-terrier brooch pinned to it . She folded the overall and placed it on the hall stand . Normally she would not take in boarders , she explained , but the house was too large , really , for herself and her mother and her daughter , just the three of them . A pity to have rooms and not use them , a pity to have them empty . The trouble was that smaller houses were usually not in districts she cared for . She led the way upstairs while still speaking about the house and household . " It 's a residence that 's been in the Lenehan family for three gen-STORY 63 erations , " she said . " That 's another consideration . " The door of a room on the second floor was open . " Fusty , " Mrs. Lenehan said and crossed to the window . The bed was narrow , the bedstead of ornamental iron . There was a washstand with an enamel basin on it and a shaving mirror above it on the wall . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a chair . Patterned , worn linoleum partially covered the floor , leaving a darkly varnished surround . There were net curtains and a blind . " The bathroom and w.c. are off the landing below , " Mrs. Lenehan said . In Mr. Lenehan 's childhood there were two maids and a cook in this house , she went on , and in her own day there 'd always been a single maid at least , and a scrubbing woman once a fortnight . Now you could n't get a servant for love or money . She noticed Barney glancing at the fireplace , which contained an arrangement of red tissue paper . She said that in the old days there 'd have been a fire laid in the grate every morning and coal blazing cheerfully every evening . Now , of course , that was out of the question . " Thirty shillings would be fair , would it ? Breakfast and 6 P.M. tea , the extra meal on a Sunday . " Barney said he thought thirty shillings was a reasonable rent for what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In advance would he fair , I think . " " Yes , it would . " " Best to have a clear arrangement , I always say . No chance for misunderstandings . " Two days later Barney moved in . When he 'd unpacked his suitcases and was waiting for the gong that Mrs. Lenehan had told him would sound at six o'clock , there was a knock on his door . " I 'm Ariadne , " Mrs. Lenehan 's daughter said , standing in the doorway with a bar of yellow soap in her hand . " My mother said give you this . " She was dark haired , about the same age as Barney . The rather long mauve dress she wore was trimmed with black , and snowy white beads were looped several times around her neck . Her lips were painted , her hands and wrists delicately slender . Large brown eyes surveyed Barney frankly and with curiosity . " Thanks very much , " he said , taking the bar of soap from her . She nodded vaguely , seeming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , and he listened to her footfall on the stairs . As light as gossamer , he said to himself . He was aware of a pleasurable sensation , a tingling on the skin of his head . The girl had brought to the room a whiff of perfume , and it remained after she 'd gone . Barney wanted to close the window to keep it with him , but he also wanted just to stand there . The sounding of the gong roused him from this pleasant reverie . He had never much cared for the appearance of the girls  --  women sometimes whom Medlicott and Slovinski admired in cafes or on the streets . Ariadne was different . There was an old-fashioned air about her and an unusualness . As well , Barney considered her beautiful . " Fennerty 's the name , " a small , jaunty old woman said in the dining room . Wiry white hair grew tidily on a flat-looking head ; eyes like beads peered at Barney . " Fennerty 's the name , " she repeated . " Mrs. Lenehan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The last occupant of his room had been employed in Clery 's bed-linen department , she replied , a youth I Ilustratinns by Gary Kelley called Con Malley , from Carlow . Now that someone had replaced him , the house would again be full . There had been difficulty in regularly extracting the rent from Con Malley . " Mrs. Lenehan wo n't tolerate anything less than promptness , " the old woman warned . A man of about fifty , wearing a navy blue belted overcoat and tan gloves , entered the dining room . " How 're you , Mr. Sheehy ? " Mrs. Fennerty inquired . Divesting himself of his coat and gloves and placing them on the seat of a chair by the door , the man replied that he was n't so good . He had a sharply receding chin , with features that had a receding look about them also , and closely clipped hair , nondescript as to color . The removal of his coat revealed a brown pin-striped suit with a row of pens and pencils clipped into the top pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left lapel . This proclaimed Mr. Sheehy 's teetotalism , the emblem of the Pioneer movement . " I had a bad debt , " Mr. Sheehy said , sitting down at the table . Mrs. Fennerty vacated a rexine-covered armchair by the fire and took her place also . Ariadne entered with a laden tray and placed plates of fried food in front of the three diners . Mrs. Fennerty said the thick Yorkshire Relish had been finished the evening before , and when Ariadne returned to the dining room a minute or so later with a metal teapot , she brought a bottle of Yorkshire Relish as well . Neither she nor her mother joined the others at the dining table . " Did you know Mattie Higgins ? " Mr. Sheehy inquired of Mrs. Fennerty . When he spoke he kept his teeth trapped behind his thin lips , as though nervous of their exposure . " 1 sold him a wireless set . Three pounds fifteen . 1 had the price agreed with him , only when I brought it round all he had was a ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he said . Come back in the morning . ' Only did n't he die that night in his bed ? " Swiftly , the old woman crossed herself . " You got caught with that one , " she said . " I was round there at eight o'clock this morning , only the place was in the hands of five big daughters . When I mentioned the wireless they ate the face off of me . A good Pye wireless gone west . " Mrs. Fennerty , still consuming her food , glanced across the room at the radio on the dumbwaiter in a corner . " Is it a Pye Mrs. Lenehan has ? " " It is . " " I heard the Pye 's the best . " " I told that to the daughters . The one 1 sold him had only a few fag burns on the cabinet . The five of them laughed at me. " " 1 know the type . " " Five fat vultures , and your man still warming the hed . " " Strumpets . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was n't broken until Ariadne came to clear the table . " 1 meant to have told you , " she remarked to Barney . " Your window gets stuck at the top . " He said it did n't matter . He had noticed her mother opening the bottom sash in preference to the top one , he added conversationally . It did n't matter in the least , he said . " The top 's stuck with paint , " Ariadne said . Mrs. Fennerty returned to her place by the fire . Mr. Sheehy put on his navy blue overcoat and his gloves and sat on the chair by the door . Skillfully , with the glass held at an angle , Mrs. Fennerty poured out a bottle of stout that had been placed in the fender to warm . On her invitation , accompanied by a warning concerning hasty digestion , Barney occupied the second rexine-covered armchair , feeling too shy to disobey . Mrs. Fennerty lit a cigarette . She was a boarder the same as Mr. Sheehy , she said . She paid her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was why she sat down in the dining room with Mr. Sheehy and whoever the third boarder happened to he . " Are you at Dowding 's ? " She referred to a commercial college that offered courses in accounting and bookkeeping , preparing its students for the bank and brewery examinations . " No . Not Dowding 's . " He explained that he was a medical student . " A doctor buries his mistakes . Did you ever hear that one ! " Mrs. Fennerty laughed shrilly , and in a sociable way Barney laughed himself . Mr. Sheehy remained impassive by the door . Barney wondered why he had taken up a position there , with his coat and gloves on . " Six feet under , no questions asked , " Mrs. Fennerty remarked , again laughing noisily . Dressed to go out , Mrs. Lenehan entered the dining room , and Mr. Sheehy 's behavior was explained . He rose to his feet , and when the pair had gone , Mrs. Fennerty said : " Those two are doing a line . Up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price of anything else . Turn round at the barracks , back by the Guards ' Depot . Then he 's down in the kitchen with her . That 's Ned Sheehy for you . " Barney nodded , not much interested in Mr. Sheehy 's courtship of Mrs. Lenehan . Nevertheless , the subject was pursued . " Ned Sheehy has a post with the Hibernian Insurance . That 's how he 'd be selling wireless sets to people . He calls in at houses a lot . " " I see . " andwritten notes clamored for attention on the green baize of the board beside the lodge of the university 's porters : love letters , brief lines of rejection , relationships terminated , charges of treachery , a stranger 's admiration confessed . The same envelope remained on the baize-covered hoard for months : " R. R. Wood-ley , " it said , but R. R. Woodley either did not exist or had long since ceased to be an undergraduate . " It is hard to find myself the way I am , and to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heart was laid bare within the dust-soiled envelope , its ache revealed to the general curiosity . But other notes , on torn half-sheets of exercise paper , remained on the green board for only a few hours , disappearing forever while they were still fresh . Within their fire-warmed lodge the porters were a suspicious breed of men , well used to attempted circumvention of the law that began where their own rule did . They wore black velvet jockey caps ; one carried a mace on ceremonial occasions . They saw to it that bicycles were wheeled through the vast archway they guarded , and that female undergraduates passed in and out during the permitted hours only , and that their book was signed when this was necessary . In the archway itself , posters advertised dances and theatrical productions . Eminent visitors were announced . Societies ' account sheets were published . There were reports of missionary work in Africa . Beyond this entrance , dark facades loomed around a cobbled square . Loops of chain protected tidily shorn lawns . The chapel stared stolidly at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue face of the dining-hall clock . A campanile rose fussily . Barney attended the lectures of Bore McGusty and Professor Makepeace-Green and the elderly Dr. Posse , who had been in the medical school in his father 's time . Bore McGusty was a long-winded young man , Professor Makepeace-Green a tetchily severe woman , who particularly objected to Slovinski reading the Daily Sketch during her lectures . The students of Barney 's age keenly took notes and paid attention , but the recent shedding of years of discipline by the ex-servicemen left them careless of their academic obligations . " Listen , " Slovinski regularly invited , interrupting Bore McGusty 's dissertation on the functioning of the bile ducts by playing Beethoven on his teeth . The medical students favored certain public houses : the International Bar , Ryan 's in Duke Street , McFadden 's . After an evening 's drink-ing they danced in the Crystal Ballroom or sat round pots of tea in the caf ? attached to the Green Cinema , where the private lives of their mentors were breezily speculated upon and for the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wartime liaisons , and Medli-cott retailed the appetites of a baker 's widow , a Mrs. Claudia Rigg of Bournemouth . For Bar-ney  --  years later  --  this time in his life was as minutely preserved as his childhood at Lisscrea . And always , at the heart of the memory , was Mrs. Lenehan 's household in Gogarty Street . 4 You 've maybe not come across the name ning . Once in a while she and her mother cleaned the windows . Mrs. Lenehan occasionally sang while she performed her household tasks . Ariadne did n't . There was no trace of reluctance in her expression , only a kind of vagueness : she had the look of a saint , Barney found himself thinking once , and the thought remained with him . In the dining room he was usually the last to finish breakfast , deliberately dawdling . Ariadne came in with a tray and , seeing him still at the table , absorbed the time by damping the fire down with wet slack and picking up the mantelpiece ornaments and dusting them . Her elegant hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her clothes never varied : the same shade of mauve combined repeatedly with mourner 's black . " Good evening , Mr. Prenderville , " she sometimes whispered in the dusk of the hall , a fleeting figure passing from one closed door to another . After he 'd been in the lodgings a month , Barney was familiar with every movement in the room above his . When Ariadne left it and did not return within a few minutes he said to himself that she was washing her hair , which he imagined wrapped in a towel , the way Nuala wrapped hers before she sat down to dry it at the range . He imagined the glow of an electric fire on . Ariadne 's long , ? damp tresses . Staring at a discolored ceiling , he invaded her privacy , investing every sound she made with his speculations . Would she be sewing or embroidering , as Nuala did in the evenings ? Nuala pressed flowers between the pages of the medical encyclopedia in the dining room at Lisscrea , pansies and primulas she asked Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ariadne did that also . He guessed the moment when she lay down ro sleep , and lay in the darkness himself , accompanying her to oblivion . He did n't tell Rouge Medlicott and Skivinski , or anyone else , about Ariadne . In his letters to his father he mentioned Mrs. Lenehan and Mrs. Fennerty and Mr. Sheehy : Ariadne might n't have existed . Yet in the noisy cafes and the lecture halls he continued to feel haunted by her and wished she was there also . He left the house in Gogarty Street reluctantly each morning and hurried back to it in the 4 evenings . 4A Mrs. Lenehan and Mr. Sheehy spent Sunday afternoons with Mrs. Fennerty in the dining room , listening to a radio commentary on a hurling or Gaelic football match , the only time the dining-room wireless was ever turned on . When it was over Mr. Sheehy and Mrs. Lenehan went to the kitchen . " Would you like to come for a walk , Ariadne ? " She did not reply at once . He gazed through the gloom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining room came the faint sound of the commentator 's rapid , excited voice . Ariadne did n't smile . She said : " This minute , Mr. Prenderville ? " " If you are doing nothing better . " " 1 will put on my coat . " He thought of her mother and Mr. Sheehy as he waited . He did n't know which direction the McKee Barracks and the Civic Guards ' Depot lay in , but wherever these places were he did n't want even to see them in the distance . " I 'm ready , " Ariadne said , having delayed for no longer than a minute . Barney opened the front door softly and softly closed it behind them . Damp autumn leaves lay thickly on the pavements , blown into mounds and heaps . When the wind gusted , more slipped from the branches above them and gently descended . Ariadne 's coat was another shade of mauve , matching her scarf . There 'd been no need to leave the house in that secret way , but they had done so nonetheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ariadne said . He said he liked the day also . He told her about Sundays at Lisscrea because he did n't know how else to interest her , His father and he would sit reading in the drawing room on a winter 's afternoon , or in the garden in the summer . Nuala would bring them tea and a cake made the day before . His father read books that were sent to him by post from a lending library in Dublin , novels by A. E. W. Mason and E. Phillips Oppenheim and " Sapper . " Once , laying one down when he had finished it , he changed his mind and handed it to Barney , " Try this , " he said , and after that they shared the books that came by post . Barney was fourteen or fifteen then . " Your mother is not there , Mr. Pren-derville ? " " My mother died . " He described Lisscrea to her : the long , narrow rooms of the house , the garden where Charlie Redmond had worked for as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall . He mentioned the cottages next to Lisscrea House and Walsh 's public house and the ruined tower he could see from his bedroom window . He re-pealed a piece of Charlie Redmond 's doggerel and described his prematurely wizened features and Nuala 's countrywoman 's looks . He told Ariadne about school at Ballinadra , the journey on the milk cart when he was small , the return by the bread van in the afternoon , and then the inheriting of his father 's old RUdge bicycle . She 'd never known a town like Ballinadra , Ariadne said ; she only knew Dublin . " It is n't much , " he said , but she wanted to know , and he tried to make a picture of the place for her : the single street and the square , O'Kevin 's hardware , the grocers ' shops that were bars as well , the statue to the men of ' 98 . " A quiet place , " Ariadne said . " Oh , a grave . " She nodded solemnly . She could see the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia creeper . She could see his father clearly . " What would you have done if I had n't suggested a walk ? " " Stayed in my room . " " Doing nothing , Ariadne ? " He spoke lightly , almost teasing her . But she was still solemn and did not smile . Maybe tidying her drawers , she said . She called him Mr. Prenderville again , and he asked her not to . " My name 's Barney . " " Just Barney ? " " Barney Gregory . " Again she nodded . They walked in silence . He said : " Will you always help your mother in the house ? " " What else would I do ? " He did n't know . He wanted to suggest some work that was worthy of her , something better than carrying trays of food to the dining room and sweeping the stair carpet . Even work in a shop was more dignified than what she did , but he did not mention a shop . " Perhaps a nurse . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no good at it . " " I 'm sure you would , Ariadne . " She would care tenderly . Her gentleness would be a blessing . Her beauty would cheer the melancholy of the ill . " Nuns are better at all that , " she said . " Did you go to a convent , Ariadne ? " She nodded , and for a moment seemed lost in the memory the question inspired . When she spoke again her voice , for the first time , was eager . " Will we walk to the convent , Barney ? It is n't far away . " " If you would like to . " " We have to turn right when we come to Prussia Street . " No one was about . The front doors of the houses they walked by were tightly closed against the world . Their footsteps were deadened by the sodden leaves . " I like that color you wear , " he said . " An aunt left me her clothes . " " An aunt ? " " A great-aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She loved this color . " " It suits you . " " She used to say that . " That was why her dresses , and the coat she wore now , were rather long for her . It was her clothes that gave her her old-fashioned air . Had she no clothes of her own ? he wondered , but did not ask . The convent was a cement building with silver-colored tailings in front of it . The blinds were drawn down in several of its windows ; lace curtains ensured privacy in the others . A brass letter box and knocker gleamed on a green side door . " Did you walk here every morning ? " he asked . " When I was small my father used to take me . It was n't out of his way . " She went on talking about that , and he formed a picture of her childhood , just as , a few moments ago , she had of his . He saw her , hand in hand with her father , hurrying through the early morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office in Easter Street . Sometimes they 'd stop at a shop for his tobacco , half an ounce of Digger . When they crossed the street he wanted to take her arm , but he did n't have the courage . They could walk to a bus stop , he suggested , and wait for a bus to O'Connell Street . They could have tea somewhere , one of the cinema caf  --  s that were open on a Sunday . But she shook her head . She 'd have to be getting hack , she said . They turned and walked the way they 'd come , past the silent houses . A driz-zle began . They did n't say much else . od , there 's talent for you ! " Medlicott exclaimed in the Crystal Ballroom , surveying the girls who stood against the walls . Slovinski conveyed a willowy woman of uncertain age onto the dance floor , from which , a few minutes later , they disappeared and did not return . Some of the girls who were standing about glanced back at Medlicott , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hair the color of newly polished brass , not at all pretty , Barney considered . Because he had no knowledge of dance steps , the partners Barney chose usually excused themselves after a minute or two . " What line are you in ? " a plump one , more tolerant than the others , inquired . He said he worked in a dry cleaner 's , Slovinski having warned him not to mention being a student , in case the girls took fright . " You ca n't dance , " the plump girl ob-served and commenced to teach him . When the end of the evening came she was still doing so . Medlicott had remained attached to the lean-featured girl , whom he confidently reported he had " got going . " Outside the dance hall Barney heard him complimenting her on her eyes , and Barney felt embarrassed because he did n't want to have to tell the plump girl that she , too , had lovely eyes , which would n't have been true . Instead , he asked her her name , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should go our to Goatstown in a taxi , since the city bars were closed by now . There were fields in Goatstown , he reminded his companions : after they 'd had a couple of nightcaps they could go for a walk through the fields in the moonlight . But Mavis said her father would skin her if she got in late . She took Barney 's arm . Her father was fierce tempered , she confided . The lean-faced girl did n't want to make the journey to Goatstown either , so Medlicott led her into an alleyway . They kissed one another in a doorway while Mavis and Barney stood some distance away . When her father went wild , Mavis said , nothing could hold him . " All right , " Barney heard the lean-faced girl say . A battered Ford car was parked at the far end of the alleyway next to a skip full of builder 's rubble , Medlicott and his companion approached it , she teetering on gold-colored high heels . Medlicott opened one of the back doors . " Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was difficult to know what to say to Mavis , so Barney did n't say anything . She talked about her brothers and sisters ; half-listening , he imagined Ariadne at Lisscrea . He imagined being engaged to her , and introducing her to Nuala in the kitchen and Charlie Redmond in the garden . He saw himself walking along the road with her and waiting while she attended mass in the nearby church . He showed her Ballinadra the rudimentary shops , the statue to the men of ' 98 in the square . He glanced at the car and caught a glimpse of brassy half through the back window . He would introduce her to the tenderhearted Miss Bone , He imagined Miss Bone dismounting from her bicycle outside O'Kevin 's hardware . " Welcome to Ballinadra , Ariadne , " she murmured in her gentle voice . Three men had turned into the alleyway and a moment later shouting began . A door of the car was wrenched open ; clothing was seized and flung out . One of the lean girl 's gold-colored shoes bounced over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skip . " Get that hooer out of my car , " a voice furiously commanded . In spite of what was happening , Barney could n't properly detach himself from his thoughts . He walked with Ariadne from the town to Lisscrea House . On the way he showed her the Lackens ' farm and the hay shed where the Black and Tans had murdered a father and a son , and the ramshackle house at the end of a long avenue , where the bread van used to call every day when he got a lift in it back from school , where mad Mrs. Joyce lived . Weeds flowered on the verges ; it must have been summer . " Get out of that bloody car ! " The garments that lay on the ground were pitched into the skip with the shoe . Medlicott called our incomprehensibly , a humorous obser-vation by the sound of it . " D' you want your neck broken ? " the same man shouted back at him . " Get out of my property . " " I 'm off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bus stop , not properly listening while she told him that a girl who would enter a motorcar as easily as that would come to an unsavory end . " I 'll look out for you in the Crystal , " she promised before they parted . On the journey back to Gogarty Street , Barney was accompanied by an impression , as from a fantasy , of Mavis 's plump body , breasts pressed against his chest , a knee touching one of his , the warm perspiration of her palm . Such physical intimacy was not the kind he had ever associated with Ariadne , but as he approached his lodgings he knew he could not let the night pass without the greater reality of seeing her face , without  --  even for an instant  --  being again in her company . When he arrived at Mrs. Lenehan 's house he continued to ascend the stairs after he 'd reached the landing off which his room lay . Any moment a light might come on , he thought ; any moment he would stand exposed and have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued , and he switched on no lights himself . Softly , he turned the handle of the door above his , and closed it , standing with his back to the panels . He could see nothing , but so close did the unspoken relationship feel that he half-expected to hear his name whispered . That did not happen ; he could not hear even the sound of breathing . He remained where he stood , prepared to do so for however many hours might pass before streaks of light showed on either side of the window blinds . He gazed at where he knew the bed must be , confirmed in this conjecture by the creeping twilight . He waited , with all the passion he possessed pressed into a longing to glimpse the features he had come ro love . He would go at once then . One day , in some happy future , he would tell Ariadne of this night of adoration . But as the room took form  --  the wardrobe , the bed , the washstand , the chest of drawers he sensed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was alone . No sleeping face rewarded his patience , no dark hair lay on the pillow . The window blinds were not drawn down . The bed was orderly and covered . The room was tidy , as though abandoned . Before the arrival of Professor Makepeace-Medlicott and Slovinski and several other ex-servicemen gave him advice as to amorous advancement in the future . His preoccupied mood went unnoticed . That evening , it was the old woman who told him . When he remarked upon Ariadne 's absence in the dining room , she said their future needs in this respect would be attended to by a maid called Biddy whom Mrs. Lenehan was in the process of employing . When he asked her where Ariadne had gone she said that Ariadne had always been religious . " Religious ? " " Ariadne 's working in the kitchen of the convent . " Mr. Sheehy came into the dining room and removed his navy blue overcoat and his tan gloves . A few minutes later Mrs. Lenehan placed the plates of fried food in front of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheehy spoke of the houses he had visited during the day , in his capacity as agent for the Hibernian Insurance Company . Mrs. Lenehan put her mother 's bottle of stout to warm in the fender . " Is Ariadne not going to live here anymore ? " Barney asked Mrs. Fennerty when Mr. Sheehy and Mrs. Lenehan had gone out for their walk to the McKee Barracks . " I 'd say she 'll remain in the convent now . Ariadne always liked that convent . " " I know . " Mrs. Fennerty lit her evening cigarette . It was to be expected , she said . It was not a surprise . " That she should go there ? " " After you took Ariadne out , Barney . You follow what I mean ? " He said he did n't . She nodded , fresh thoughts agreeing with what she had already stated . She poured her stout . She had never called him Barney before . " It 's called going out , Barney . Even if it 's nothing very much . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in the convent ? " " She did n't tell you about Lenehan ? She did n't mention her father , Barney ? " " Yes , she did . " " She did n't tell you he took his life ? " The old woman crossed herself , her gesture as swift as it always was when she made it . She continued to pour her stout , expertly draining it down the side of the glass . " No , she did n't tell me that . " " When Ariadne was ten years old her father took his life in an upstairs room . " " Why did he do that , Mrs. Fennerty ? " " He was not a man I ever liked . " Again she paused , as though to dwell privately upon her aversion to her late son-in-law . " Shame is the state Ariadne lives in , " " Shame ? " " Can you remember when you were ten , Barney ? " He nodded . It was something they had in common , he 'd said to Ariadne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any child had affection for a father , Mrs. Fennerty was saying . " Why did Mr. Lenehan take his life ? " Mrs. Fennerty did not reply . She sipped her stout . She stared into the glow of the fire , then threw her cigarette end into it . She said Mr. Lenehan had feared arrest . " Arrest ? " Barney repeated , stupidly . " There was an incident on a tram . " Again the old woman blessed herself . Her jauntiness had left her . She repeated what she 'd told him the first evening he sat with her : that her daughter was a fool where men were concerned . " At that time people looked at Ariadne on the street . When the girls at the convent shunned her , the nuns were nice to her . She 's never forgotten that . " " What kind of an incident , Mrs. Fennerty ? " " A child on a tram . They have expressions for that kind of thing . I do n't even like to know them . " He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was as though he had been told not of the death of Ariadne 's father but of her own . He wished he had taken her arm when they went for their walk . He wished she 'd said yes when he 'd suggested they should have tea in a cinema caf ? . Not so long ago he had n't even known she existed , yet now he could n't imagine not loving her . " It would have been no good , Barney . " He asked her what she meant , but she did n't answer . He knew anyway . It would have been no good because what seemed like a marvel of strangeness in Ariadne was damage wrought by shame . She had sensed his love , and fear had come , possibly revulsion . She would have hated it if he 'd taken her arm , even if he 'd danced with her , as he had with Mavis . " Ariadne 'll stay there always now , " the old woman said , sipping more of her stout . Delicately , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a silver lining that there 'd been the convent kitchen to go to , that the same nuns were there to be good to her . " She would still be here if I had n't taken the room . " " You were the first young man , Barney . You could n't be held to blame . " hen Barney returned to Dublin from Liss-found , unexpectedly , that he had been allocated college rooms . He explained that in Gogarty Street , and Mrs. Lenehan said it could n't be helped . " Mr. Sheehy and myself are getting married , " she added in the hall . Barney said he was glad , which was not untrue . Mr. Sheehy had been drawn toward a woman 's property ; for her part , Mrs. Lenehan needed more than a man could offer her on walks to the McKee Barracks . Mrs. Lenehan had survived the past ; she had not been dam . aged ; second time round , she had settled for Mr. Sheehy . In the dining room he said good-bye to Mrs. Fennerty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office who was looking for digs , she said . He would take the vacant room ; it would n't be empty for long . A student called Browder had moved into Ariadne 's a week or so after her going . It had n't been empty for long either . It was snowing that evening . Huge flakes clung to Barney 's overcoat as he walked to the convent , alone in the silence of the streets . Since Ariadne 's going he had endlessly loitered by the convent , but its windows were always blank , as they were on that Sunday afternoon . Tonight , a dim light burned above the green side door , but no curtain twitched as he scanned the gray facade , no footsteps disturbed the white expanse beyond the railings . In the depths of the ugly building were the strangeness and the beauty as he had known them , and for a moment he experienced what was left of his passion : a useless longing to change the circumstances there had been . While he was still in Mrs. Lenehan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a romantic urge , potent before love began to turn into regret . He had imagined himself ringing the convent bell and again see-ing Ariadne 's face . He had imagined himself smiling at her with all the gentleness he pos-sessed , and walking again with her ; and per-suading her , when time had passed , that love was possible . " You 'll get over her , " his father had said during the holidays , guessing only that there had been some girl .
