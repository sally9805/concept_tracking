It is not surprising , then , that the new joint effort of the City Planning Commission , the City Public Development Corporation and the State Urban Development Corporation made public earlier this month should bring an initial reaction of skepticism . Why should this plan work where the others have failed ? // But there are a number of differences between this effort and earlier ones . The current plan ( which is unrelated to plans announced by private groups for 42d Street east of Seventh Avenue ) is a largescale redevelopment project , not a simple cleanup . This time the city and the state , which have a history of working at cross-purposes , have joined forces toward the common goal of making the area around 42d Street from Broadway to Eighth Avenue a focus for significant and profit-making real-estate development. // Two vehicles will carry out this effort - the city ' s Public Development Corporation , a fairly new agency , and the state ' s Urban Development Corporation , which has achieved an impressive record of accomplishment in the last two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York City Convention Center and Battery Park City . These are both projects that have seemed as impossible to get moving as the Westway , and if any organization appears capable of making a dent in Times Square , it is the U.D.C. // What the city and state have come up with is not a firm plan , but some very tentative proposals that will have little meaning until private real-estate developers respond to them . The heart of the proposal is the active involvement of private developers , who will do the actual building ; the city and state will assemble the land and offer a set of guidelines and requirements that developers must meet to take advantage of city and state aid. // Cooper Eckstut Associates , the urban-design firm that created guidelines for Battery Park City , has evolved the basic outlines of the project and suggested a number of possible options for development on different sites . These have been assembled in a 69-page " discussion document " now being distributed to real-estate developers , community residents , politicians and business leaders . Based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more formal " request for proposals " document to be issued in the spring , and it is this document to which developers are expected to respond. // The plan has several basic notions . First , it calls for the retention and rehabilitation of all or most of the theaters now on West 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues , now mostly used for pornographic or second-run films but built as legitimate theaters and among the city ' s finest theaters architecturally . The planners hope that theaters on both sides of the street can be grouped around new central lobbies to be constructed in the middle of each block . <> <> Renovation of Times Tower Proposed // Second , it proposes office towers for the west side of Seventh Avenue between 41st and 42d Streets , and between 42d and 43d Streets , which are now occupied mostly by low-rise buildings of little architectural quality. // Third , at Times Square itself , it suggests the renovation of the former Times Tower into a structure of bright lights and different shape to function as a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of 42d Street between Broadway and Seventh Avenue would be turned into a major subway entrance or used for office-tower construction. // To serve the garment district , the proposal calls for an apparel mart or showroom building on the east side of Eighth Avenue from 40th to 42d Streets , opposite the Port Authority Bus Terminal . A low retail structure , an apartment house or a hotel are offered as alternatives for the northeast corner of Eighth Avenue and 42d Street. // The plan appears based in realism : it recognizes that since the legitimate theater left West 42d Street 50 years ago for the blocks just to the north , the street has been a void between three major districts - the garment center to the south , the midtown office center to the east and the present theater district . West 42d Street is a kind of " no man ' s land " between these areas , part of none of them and a barrier to expansion for all of them. // The planners ' notion is to tie 42d Street into the neighboring areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mart , for example , would add much-needed showroom space to the garment district and give that area a focal point it has never had , as well as put an end to the present " Maginot Line " that seems to cut off the garment center from the blocks to its north. // The placement of office towers to the east takes advantage of the likely movement of office space west of the Avenue of the Americas and attempts to work within natural conditions of the real-estate market . The theater rehabilitations , on the other hand , recognize both the growing economic strength of the Broadway theater and the growing realization that behind the neon signs and shrill marquees of the 42d Street theaters is a rich architectural wonderland. // There are certain obvious similarities between this plan and the project called City at 42d Street , the last major attempt to redevelop the area . That plan , sponsored by the Ford Foundation with Olympia &; York , the Toronto-based developers , as its builder , was rejected by Mayor Koch last June , at which time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulation of a new one. // Given the recent record of the various participants , it is likely that there will be somewhat more attention paid to the public environment : to get city and state approval to build , developers will have to agree to meet requirements for many public amenities such as new subway entrances , ground-floor retail space and so forth. // No one is predicting too much for 42d Street this early in the game . It is a street of too many failed hopes - of planners ' failures as much as people ' s failures , and at this point almost everyone , government official and citizen alike , is somewhat jaded. // But if there was any scheme that appeared to have a chance , it is this one - not because it is big , or splashy , or spectacular , but because it is realistic . It calls for a 42d Street that is part of the rest of New York , not a thing apart. //                @ @ @ @ @
