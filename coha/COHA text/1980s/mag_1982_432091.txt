 | It 's a particularly sad disease because its major symptom is failure . A victim may not be able to read or write without reversing letters ? " b " becomes " d " and " dog " turns into " god . " A child with the disorder sometimes ca n't follow simple instructions ; asked to go to his room and get a sweater , he returns with a book or forgets to come back at all . Some victims have to look at marks on their hands so they can tell left from right . Many ca n't recite a story without starting in the middle or at the end . " The confusion drives us nuts , " says one victim . " We 're hard to live with . We are often humiliated . " The disease is so baffling that the experts are still struggling to find the right name for it .

Duane , " a greater health problem than the combined occurrence of mental retardation , cerebral palsy and epilepsy . " Many dyslexics are indeed treated as retarded children , despite normal or better-than-normal IQ 's . " No matter how successful I become , " says a 39-year-old New York woman who has finally worked her way into college , " there 'll always be that feeling they 'll find out I 'm really dumb . " Dyslexics often are berated by teachers and parents for being lazy , inattentive or stubborn . " It all hit me in the fourth grade , " recalls Andy Krantz , 12 , of Weston , Mass . " The kids called me dummy . It took me two times longer to do anything than it did other kids . I was terrified of homework .

Just as sadly , many remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been a doctor , " notes a 34-year-old Brooklyn dyslexic who is now a plumbing contractor . Constellation ' : Dyslexia is a complex disability in the use of language . In addition , many dyslexics are hyperactive and distractible , poorly coordinated and have trouble with math . " Dyslexia is not a single thing , " says Margaret B. Rawson , a Maryland teacher specializing in the disorder . " It 's a constellation of factors . " Steven Mattis of New York 's Montefiore Hospital and Medical Center has identified four main types of language problems in dyslexia : ( 1 ) A problem in naming objects . A cup , for example , becomes " a drinking thing . " ( 2 ) " Motor speech " defects which make it difficult to utter smoothly sequenced sounds , such as " clo " in closet . ( 3 ) A visual-perceptual disorder which causes trouble in distinguishing similar letters like " n , " " h " and " r. " ( 4 ) Problems with " phonemic sequencing , " in which the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproduce them , much like being able to recognize two musical notes without being able to sing them . Reading , Mattis points out , " requires successful integration of many different skills ? visual , auditory , linguistic , motor and reasoning . A problem with any one distorts integration . " Serious medical study of the problem was pioneered in the 1920s by Dr. Samuel T. Orton , a University of Iowa psychiatrist . Orton noted that a good many dyslexics are left-handed . Since motor control of the left hand is governed by the right side of the brain and since the language centers in most people are located in the " dominant " left cerebral hemisphere , Orton concluded that the language problem in dyslexia involved " mixed dominance , " a competition and confusion between the left and right hemispheres . Neurologists today tend to discount the mixed-dominance theory , but they agree that dyslexia is a neurological problem centered in the brain . Among dyslexics , boys outnumber girls by an estimated 4 to 1 . " Boys are poorer at everything in early years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Hospital National Medical Center in Washington , D.C. " More brain damage , fetal mortality , @# @#  | genetic disorders . There 's every reason to believe that the protoplasm of the male is just generally weaker . " Using sophisticated techniques , neurologists are obtaining new clues about the causes of dyslexia . Conventional brainwave studies with the electroencephalograph have failed to detect clear-cut abnormalities . But Dr. Frank H. Duffy of Boston Children 's Hospital Medical Center has combined the EEG with a computer to study dyslexics . Duffy 's technique , called Brain Electrical Activity Mapping ( BEAM ) , produces a color picture of activity in the brain . BEAM has been used on about 50 dyslexics while they listened to music and stories , picked out figures associated with words and read . When their brain patterns were compared to those of nondyslexic children , Duffy found significant differences which might be useful in diagnosing the disorder . His research suggests that dyslexia involves widespread areas of the brain , not just the left hemisphere . One region of abnormal activity was found , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a motor area not usually linked to language skill . This may explain why dyslexia is often accompanied by hyperactivity . " Dyslexia may represent dysfunction within a complex and widely distributed brain system , not a discrete brain lesion , " says Duffy . Jumbling : But other investigators are examining the brain tissue itself and finding specific abnormalities . Dr. Albert M. Galaburda of Boston 's Beth Israel Hospital and Dr. Thomas L. Kemper of Boston City Hospital made thin slices of the brain of a 20-year-old dyslexic killed in an accident . They discovered abnormalities among cells in the language areas of the left hemisphere . These included gray-matter cells scattered in areas normally made up of white matter as well as a " jumbling " of neurons that usually are neatly arranged in columns . Such misplacement of cells is typically found in fetal brains , suggesting that dyslexia involves a disruption of the orderly process of maturation . " Probably these pieces of brain are miswired , like a radio that does n't work , " says Dr. Norman Geschwind , a Beth Israel neurologist who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to subject animal fetuses to radiation , viruses , hormones and other environmental influences to see if they produce similar brain abnormalities and thus shed light on the possible causes of dyslexia . Some researchers believe dyslexia may be treatable with drugs . Rachel Gittelman of the New York State Psychiatric Institute has tried Ritalin , the stimulant often given to hyperactive children , on dyslexics . Although it improved attention span , it had no effect on reading ability . Currently , six U.S. centers are testing a drug called piracetam , which resembles one of the chemicals in the brain . Piracetam , which has shown some promise in British trials , may improve verbal memory by enhancing left-hemisphere function or by aiding neural transmission between the two hemispheres . Programs : At the moment , the treatment of dyslexia is educational rather than medical . Under Federal law , public schools must have programs for teaching youngsters with learning disorders . Unfortunately , many of the programs are inadequate for dyslexics . " They put a child on a mechanical reader which runs by him like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize the child ca n't figure out what 's on the screen in three minutes , much less three seconds , " says C. Wilson Anderson Jr. , a Minnesota highschool teacher . Dyslexics are often put into the same classes with retarded or emotionally disturbed children , to the benefit of no one . And many teachers are poorly prepared to deal with dyslexia . " Teachers get more training in art and music than they get in reading , " says Anderson . Ideally , in the view of most experts , children should be screened for dyslexia in the first grade , or even kindergarten . Tests at the prereading age include letter and picture naming , design copying and memory . Teachers should be especially vigilant when youngsters are late learning to talk , or show a disparity between their abilities to speak and write , both early clues to dyslexia . Remedial training takes years of intensive and patient effort . At the Carroll School , a private day school for dyslexics in Lincoln , Mass. , classes are small and the children get plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break- ing text into letters and then assembling them into syllables and words according to memorized rules . They use phonogram cards to learn to recognize and pronounce letter-groupings like " tch " in " catch " and " ind " in " mind . " They write down nonsense words like " dipsod , " " strag " and " swiv , " as dictated by the teacher , so they can concentrate on spelling without the distraction of meaning . They also tap a finger with each syllable as they read to help prevent the words from running together in their minds . An important tenet of many programs for dyslexics is making use of all of a child 's senses . At Carroll , children speak words out loud when they read , make letters out of clay and sometimes use typewriters . " You hit the key and you get reinforcement with that finger , " says headmaster Allan L. Forsythe . " We find kids spell better when they type . " Outside the classroom , the youngsters take part in exercises and gymnastics ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall called a " confidence cliff " to enhance self-esteem . Learning to Cope : Training for a dyslexic is a lifetime process . " We used to think that if we brought kids up to par we could fold our arms with satisfaction , " says Dr. Martha Bridge Denckla of the National Institutes of Health . " But we 've found almost all the kids will need help again . " As a child progresses through the grades , he must unlearn some habits , like subtracting from left to right . But other strategies he has developed in order to cope can be useful . One bright child , who could n't read well throughout high school , was permitted to conduct his classwork orally . Now he is a student in medical school . Field trips to museums , film strips and other " nonbook " teaching techniques help dyslexics get an education . " We have got to be sure that the bright boy who can not learn from books continues to learn , " says Denckla . Nearly every dyslexic can reach sixthgrade level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go on to graduate school . Not a few dyslexics , including Woodrow Wilson , Hans Christian Andersen and William Butler Yeats , become high achievers . But for most , life is a continuing struggle against a formidable handicap . " Dyslexia is like alcoholism , " says Conners . " It is never really cured . " But during the struggle , a gratifying number learn to accept and cope with the problem . " Hold on to the positives , " Harry Sands of the Postgraduate Center for Mental Health in New York told a group of fellow dyslexics recently . " Do n't panic , you have time . " Sands should know . He spent ten years and received a good many " incompletes " in his university graduate courses , but he got his Ph.D . @# 56 NEWSWEEK/MARCH 22 , 1982
