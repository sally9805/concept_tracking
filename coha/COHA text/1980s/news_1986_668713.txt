Although Downers Grove ' s economic development began in the 1950s , long before many suburbs realized the importance of a diversified tax base , the fervor of its growth became evident a few months ago when a developer purchased 31 homes in the village for commercial use . Philip Mappa Interests , of Des Plaines , felt the 45-acre parcel near the intersection of 31st Street and Highland Avenue , was more valuable for commercial rather than residential use . He negotiated individually with the owners and paid them 1/2 to 2 times what they would have received on the open market for their homes . Then he annexed the property to the west suburb and had it rezoned . Eventually there will be a 300-room hotel and approximately 1. 5 million square feet of office space on the property , which was once home to barbecues and swing sets . At the time , Mappa said that he purchased that property because of its location near the Highland Avenue interchange of the East-West Tollway . He could have purchased twice the acreage nearby for half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property because " it ' s better situated and wooded . " Like many suburbs , " expansion of the tax base " is the major concern Downers Grove faces today , said Larry Long , president of the Downers Grove Chamber of Commerce . The village has to offer , according to Long , " a very strategic location , along the East-West Tollway and only 25 to 30 minutes from both the Loop and O ' Hare Airport . " Because the village has little vacant land left to develop within its current boundaries , it is important that it make the most of what it has left , said Stephen Veitch , village manager . " We would like to see the remaining open land developed in a way that best postures Downers Grove to remain a financially viable community in the long run , " Veitch said . " However , we are trying to keep a handle on what is happening and the pace . " Of the vacant land , there are about 250 acres in the south end of the community to be developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite end of the community to be developed for research and light industrial uses . However , Veitch does anticipate that Downers Grove also will expand its boundaries and numbers slightly through future annexations . He said that the 1980 census , which reported the population to be 42 , 572 , is really closer to 46 , 000 at this time . By the turn of the century that number should rise to about 56 , 000 , Veitch said , which is in agreement with the population predictions by the Northeastern Illinois Planning Commission . Most of that rise will be attributable to future annexations , according to Veitch . In addition to what the Local Community Fact Book ' s accounting of " over 90 manufacturing concerns employing over 6 , 000 workers and over 150 service establishments employing over 4 , 000 persons , " Downers Grove has a healthy retail base . The retail base contributes about $6 million in sales tax revenue annually to the village ' s operating budget . New retail establishments may raise that amount to about $7. 5 million within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s retail base includes nine shopping areas , scattered throughout the community , including a busy stretch of Ogden Avenue and an extensive downtown shopping area . Unlike many suburbs that are struggling to maintain a viable town center by making a reluctant shift from a retail to a service emphasis , Downers Grove ' s downtown has retained an old fashioned retail variety and vitality . " We have several larger retail stores that have been there a long time. . . they are almost community traditions , " Veitch said . " The only nail- biting we did was when we lost our Sears ( catalog ) store . " Only once in Long ' s six years has the village had a vacancy in the downtown area for any significant time period , which was caused by the Sears ' closing . Eventually the village cooperated with a developer to remodel the store and bring in half a dozen retailers . And today , there are no vacancies in Downers Grove ' s downtown . As an indication of the village ' s success at their goal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last 10 years its property tax has declined . The aggregate tax rate for most of the community is $6. 5022 per $100 assessed valuation . Of that , the village ' s share is $. 9018 . The housing in Downers Grove is varied . There are older sections with neat frame houses and brand new subdivisions . The Maple Grove section in south west Downers Grove has homes set into the hilly terrain where the natural vegetation has been preserved . After much debate , in the 1960s , apartment units were approved . Today , they ring the downtown area , helping to maintain a healthy downtown population . Condominiums are available throughout the community . According to the 1980 census , about two-third of Downers Grove ' s housing units are single family and about three-quarters are owner occupied . The median value of a single family home was $79 , 300 and the median rent $283 monthly , according to the census . However , house prices range widely from $65 , 000 to $200 , 000-plus , condo prices from $50 , 000 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Downers Grove has 12 elementary schools , 2 junior highs and 2 high schools . According to the Chicagoland Community Guide , the teacher-student ratio is 19 to 1 and $2 , 313 is spent on each student annually . Downers Grove ' s park district has more than 350 acres of parkland , including 27 parks and a golf course and a year-round recreation program .
