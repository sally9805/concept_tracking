Now in its fourth full year of operation , the 34-acre site has reached the stage where it houses approximately 10 , 000 visitors ( including athletes , coaches , trainers , and officials ) each year . And in the next couple of years , as the Olympics draw nearer , that figure undoubtedly will increase. // The center still has a long way to go to reach its full potential , with many millions of dollars worth of construction either still under way or awaiting the necessary funds . Even in its current incomplete state , however , it has already more than justified its existence by helping numerous individual athletes get ready for competition and by bolstering the whole idea of creating national teams. // The best-known example of the latter is the women ' s volleyball team , which grew from obscurity to the rank of a world power during its two years in residence here. // " They showed that the national team concept worked , " says Bob Mathias , the two-time Olympic decathlon champion who serves as director of the center. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for after working so hard to become contenders , the women saw their hopes go down the drain along with those of other US athletes in the boycott of the Moscow Olympics . They subsequently moved away and are now based in California , but Mathias says this was primarily a case of fallout from the boycott , and that they could conceivably come back later. // " The boycott decision really devastated them , he explains . " Their morale was so low , and their future so uncertain . To revive and start all over again , they needed a change of scenery . Some wanted to go to school , some wanted to get jobs , and there were just more opportunities there. // " Also , the idea of separate living quarters appealed to them after being so close together living in dormitories here for so long . But they might come back when its gets closer to the Olympics . That would be up to them. " // The center ' s main feature as far as athletic facilities are concerned is the 400-meter artificially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pits for field events such as jumping and pole vaulting , and a Super-Turf infield in which soccer and field hockey teams can practice. // For the moment , athletes in most other sports still have to be transported from the center to pools , gyms , rinks , and other training sites at the nearby US Air Force Academy or to local schools , parks and clubs . Construction is already under way , however , on a $4 million field house which will include seven separate gymnasiums equipped for various sports , while a Natatorium housing a 50-meter Olympic pool plus a separate 10-meter diving platform is in the planning stages. // " The first priority was the track , " Mathias explained . " Next was the field house , and the money for that was approved in the latest budget . After that , comes the swimming pool . The next budget won ' t be until 1985 , but there ' s always the chance we could get the money privately and do it earlier. " // There is a recreational pool which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some gymnasium facilities including a fully equipped weight room . But obviously it will take the two big construction projects above to really complete the picture. // Even as is , however , the center is quite impressive , with dormitory space and dining facilities able to handle more than 500 athletes a day  --  and these , too , are being expanded. // In a typical month , the center hosts athletes in a wide variety of sports such as track and field , volleyball , cycling , swimming , field hockey , weightlifting , etc . And although the facilities are for summer sports , the winter athletes are frequent visitors , too. // " People don ' t realize that winter athletes do a lot of their conditioning in the summer , " pointed out a US Olympic Committee ( USOC ) spokesman . He noted that Eric Heiden , winner of five gold medals at Lake Placid , was here twice with the speed skaters , and that cross country skiers and biathlon competitors have also used the facilities. // Athletes are chosen by the national governing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation between hometowns and the center ) is paid by the USOC. // Mathias , whose gold medals in 1948 and 1952 make him the only two-time Olympic decathlon winner , served four terms in Congress in the 1960s and ' 70s , during which time he continually pressed for legislation aimed at coordinating the often helter-skelter administration of national sports programs . His efforts and those of others eventually bore fruit , though he was no longer in Congress when a bill was finally passed in 1977 giving the USOC authority over Olympic amateur sports and providing it with federal backing. // It was in that same year that the USOC embarked on its training center idea , opening the one here and another at Squaw Valley . The latter site , troubled by the high cost of operation and its relative inaccessibility , was closed in 1980 . But the one here , with Mathias in charge from the beginning , has flourished. // " The most exciting part was when we started from scratch , " Mathias says , recalling the day when the USOC took over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn it into a training center . The base had been abandoned for two years , and it took a lot of repairing , wiring , painting , etc. , before he could even think about anything else . Even that first year , though , the center hosted a hockey team for training and a couple of organizations for meetings . In 1978 it was far enough along to bring in 6 , 000 people , and the total has increased each year since. // Ideally there would be at least one other center somewhere else in the country  --  probably in the East , and preferably containing winter training facilities . The 1980 Winter Olympic site at Lake Placid has been mentioned , but there may be too many administrative and logistical problems . In fact it is difficult to find any one place that provides the necessary facilities for training , housing , and feeding the athletes , plus accessibility  --  all at a cost the USOC can afford. // So Colorado Springs may be it for a while  --  but even so . US athletes are obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years ago. // //
