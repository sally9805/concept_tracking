The shoeless Ambassador reclines on a chaise longue that is covered with classified cables . In a Churchillian pose , he holds a thick cigar in one hand and shoos away his old English sheep dog , Wellington , with the other . Deane Hinton then offers TIME 'S Timothy Loughran some frank views on his two-year stint as envoy to El Salvador and the aims of U.S. policy there : <P> <P> Q. Are you becoming more encouraged or discouraged as the conflict continues ? <P> <P> A. Sometimes you get a little discouraged and weary . But we have the policy basically right . We have to have patience and perseverance . I 've had my problems when the resources have n't come . But there is progress : the elections last year , the functioning of a government . Political parties that seemed as though they would shoot each other at one point are now working together . There is continued progress on agrarian reform and human rights . It 's glacial progress . It 's maddening , but it 's there . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. The aid came too little too late . That 's one of the reasons we 're still in this mess . We needed more economic aid early on , and we needed the military aid the President asked for last year at the time he asked for it . We lost momentum . When Congress turns down presidential requests for aid , it encourages the guerrillas to keep fighting . It also discourages the Salvadoran army . The guerrillas think Washington is where they 're going to win the war . They know damn well they 're not going to win it here . <P> <P> Q. How long will it take to end the war ? <P> <P> A. It could end in a year or 18 months if the outside support for the guerrillas stopped . If U.S. aid is cut off , the war would go on an awful long time and be bloodier than hell . I do n't think the government can win without U.S. support . <P> <P> Q. How long will it take to clean up the human rights abuses by government security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would like to see it is a question of years and generational change . It is moving in the right direction , but to establish a civilian democratic government dedicated to making the country run and to get the military out of politics will take a generation . The human rights abuses could stop very quickly if the war stopped . If there is no provocation , you 're not going to find all these people dead all the time . <P> <P> Q. What are the popular misconceptions of El Salvador in the U.S. ? <P> <P> A. This ai n't Viet Nam , and it sure as hell better not end the way Viet Nam ended . People bring Viet Nam up all the time because they know Viet Nam is unpopular . It plays on a fear and a phobia that are built into the American consciousness . <P> <P> Q. If the two sides met , what points could be negotiated ? <P> <P> A. I think in a serious dialogue about how the guerrillas can participate in elections , there are a lot of negotiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the candidates , whether they want ten bodyguards or 20 bodyguards . Other negotiable points include weapons permits , the role of the security forces and even the participation of outsiders . <P> <P> Q. What has been the chief stumbling block so far ? <P>
