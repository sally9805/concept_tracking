into the brake , Her legs are jerking and she 's spazzing out . Somehow we stop and I grab the keys , screaming my head off for help . The only thing is , we 're there in this giant Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight blocking an entire intersection in the middle of Harlem . She 's wearing her mink coat and all this jewelry . All these black people are crowding around the car . We look like two rich crazy ladies , and I think : I 'm a liberal , but how are they going to know ? And I 'm afraid to open the door . I 'm totally panicked . And all of a sudden my mom is completely calm . She says , Janice , give me the keys and I will drive you to the airport . That 's it . Not please , not I 'm sorry , just give me the keys . And you know what ? I gave her the keys . So she starts up again and I 'm in the front seat this time . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't even remember thinking  --  just blank . Soon she 's saying I should have a good time in Paris , because she 'll be dead when I get back . And I say something really stupid , So , who 's supposed to feed the dog while you 're dead ? I mean , I know it was a really stupid thing to say , but I was thinking of the time before when she took fifty Seconals and left a note in the kitchen that said , While I 'm dead , feed the dog . By now we 're on the bridge . She starts screaming that she is really going to kill me , and she turns sharp to the right across two lanes . I grab the wheel and try to jam on the brake , and we sort of bounce off this cement embankment . And I grab the keys again . And the same thing happens again . I 'm crying and screaming , and she 's yelling and spazzing out . Two lanes of traffic on the bridge are stopped and honking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine , like nothing happened . She tells me to give her back the keys , she promises not to kill me , and so I do . That seems really weird , does n't it  --  me just giving her back the keys like that . So it was about four years later that I went and found this shrink , Phyllis . She was nice . By then my mom had died . It was like , while she was alive , I did n't really want to talk about it too much , I mean , I guess I 'm lucky she died so I could stop thinking I was the one who was crazy . But one day I 'm in there telling this shrink , Phyllis , about being driven off the bridge , and the time she tried to run my brother over and the Seconals  --  all those stories . And Phyllis is listening real intently . And suddenly I think , oh my God . How is she gon na know I 'm not just making this up ? What if my mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me presents ? How would she know ? Everything she knows about me is what I say . What if I 'm lying and do n't even know it , and I 'm just deluded , and none of the stuff I remember actually happened ? and trees , and I had a great many other allergies that I think a lot of Jewish boys are familiar with . There was an allergist I had to go to . He lived in Manhattan , which for a wimp boy like myself was a long adventurous trip . It held a lot of terrors for me , one of which was the subway. 1 lived way out in Queens , on the edge of the city near Nassau County . I had to take a bus to the train , then catch the F train into Manhattan , get off , go to the allergist , and come back . One morning I 'm leaving my house , and I 'm in my constant state of teenage depression because in those days my mother was often ill , and she was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she wished she never had children . Sort of a cheery way to start my day . Back then there was n't all that much subway violence . There were n't that many teenagers wandering around eating people and throwing them on the tracks . What bothered me was that there were so many machines down there of such a powerful nature , and it was so dark and so far under the ground that I always felt that the tunnel was going to fall in on me , that the train would smash into a wall and kill us all . I should have brought a book . I would have been better off . I get on the front car . I always got on the front car of a train , and to this day I still like to get on the front car . I think it has something to do with some sort of identification with the surge of power that 's involved in being in the front of a train . When you 're a teenager in the city , one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since horses and bulls are not around , is a train . When that train comes rumbling and roaring into the station and you 're a teenager , it just fills your blood with a kind of crazy excitement . So I always used to get on the first car of the train and sit down . Also , without realizing it , I always sat somewhere near the front of the front car and looked a little bit out the window with the reinforced glass in the front of the car . 1 would sit there , but one thing I never seemed to have the nerve to do , although I wanted to , was to go up and look out the window . First of all , I felt that it would be extremely uncool to stand there like some jerk-off and just stare out the window . When I was fifteen , I did n't want to seem like I was six . I wanted to took out the front of the train but I never would , so a terrible tug-of-war took place in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the window and look from the corner of my eye out the window . We 're rumbling along , and we go about three or four stops , the doors open and they close and just before they close absolutely a big fat handgets thrust through the doors . So then the doors open again ' cause this hand would n't move , and in comes what we used to call , when I was a teenager , a retard . This guy , who could have been anywhere from fifteen to thirty-five , retarded , comes onto the train with a nutty look on his face . No on this car that I was sitting in there were about four or five people  --  two businessmen , a few ladies going shopping  --  and they 're all looking at books or Bibles or reading the New York Times , or something like that . And I was n't doing anything except sitting there , worried  --  the Jewish Hamlet from Queens wondering about whether to be or not to be on the F train , I 'm sitting there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herbie 's here . Herbie is here ! " with this loud voice and the stupidest grin . He was slump  --  shouldered with a potbelly , had flat black shoes on , and a loose jacket that looked real big in front , like he was pregnant . He had dim eyes , a big thick jaw , and big hairy ears . And he says to nobody in particular , but in a loud and happy voice , " Here 's Herbie . Herbie is here ! " I 'm thinking to myself , oh God , do n't let this retard sit down next to me . I want a little privacy in my misery . Everybody else in the train just kept staring at their newspapers . But I could n't help watching this guy Herbie with that terrible sick knowledge that people who are a little freakish or lonely or who live in a very strange family like I did , unfortunately , have in common with other people who have problems . So I was watching him with a combined feeling of disgust and terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herbie , here 's Herbie , " looks around , sees that nobody really cares , and then without further ado , he unzips his jacket and pulls out , of all things , a steering wheel  --  the kind you give kids , with a suction cup to stick on the dashboard  --  and he goes over to this window that I had sort of been looking out of but did n't have the nerve to go to . He moistens the suction cup with some spit  --  disgusting  --  and sticks it right on the window . So this retard is now steering the train . And he has absolutely no doubts  --  he 's like Albert Schweitzer and Jonas Salk , this guy . From the day he is born he knows he 's gon na conquer the Zambezi or be the greatest ice-cream salesman  --  one of those kinds of guys . Whereas me , a total halfwit , 1 had no idea what I wanted to do , if I even wanted to do anything , or if I even wanted to be . So the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his red plastic steering wheel steering the train . The train pulls into Hillside Avenue , and then pulls out , and it 's rumbling along , clackety , clackety , clack . On a hard curve , he just sort of leans into it , like when you 're driving a car . He 's having the time of his life . The other passengers , since he was n't looking around , were looking at him with this amused , tolerant , pitying look on their faces . / was thinking to myself , Jesus Christ , here 's this guy , a retard , a jerk , and I am so brilliant , I do well in school , I 'm a handsome little devil , my mother loves me , I 'm athletic , do baseball cards better , and here 's this guy nobody could possibly care about , who looks like a pile of hay , comes on and does the one thing that I had sort of always wanted to do on the train . He just went right up there and he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see the conductor pushing the levers and looking out . He might as well have been reading a magazine . Next to him , about a foot away , although he ca n't see him , is Herbie riding for his life , driving what might as well have been the USS Enterprise on its five-year mission through space . Now were crossing the river . We roar through the tunnel into Manhattan . More people are getting on the train , and they see Herbie , and  --  you know how in New York you create a vacuum between yourself and whatever nut du Jour happens to he on , you just stay away from him  --  so people are coming on and getting off , and Herbie notices nor a bit . He 's screaming , " Here 's Herbie , here 's Herbie , " and he 's driving that train wherever it has to go . Well , all strange things come to an end . We got to my stop on the East Side . As I leave , Her-hie is still there , drumming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get to the allergist , and this schmegege says , " How ate we doin Mike ? " This guy 's World War II vintage . He 's about fifty , bald , a gigantic guy , tough , bluff , and hearty , who makes his living by sticking needles in young people . Whether it did any good is beyond me . I continued to sneeze my head off until I was thirty-four years old anyhow . He sticks a couple of needles in my arm and I get out fast . So I get back on the train and I 'm headed toward Queens . The train gathers speed , it 's about three in the afternoon , and I 'm very depressed now First of all , this experience with Herbie driving the train and me not being able to do it really got on my nerves . And I know I 'm going to go home and my mother 's gon na be in her room , and she 's gon na be upset , and the rabbi is gon na be there , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm , thinking about Herbie . Without thinking , I 'd gotten on the first car again . I look sideways at the front window , and this feeling comes over me of what-the-hell . Mylife is a total cesspool anyhow , and here I am  --  life is passing me by , there are millions of things 1 want to do , and I never do them . I 'm just gon na do it . I walk over , and I put my face right up against the window of the train , and I look out . I started losing my feeling of self-consciousness that anybody was looking at me . It was as beautiful as I ever imagined it to be . Here I am in the front of this great train which has no thought for anybody else at all . This train represents pure power . It just surges through this tunnel . It 's got ta be the feeling that the first sperm has when those millions and billions of sperms just get out there and a gun goes off and they start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest sperm goes whammo  --  he knows just where he 's going . Well , that 's what the train was doing . It was charging through that tunnel , passing people by like they were ants . It represented everything that I was n't . Here I am , this little weak wimp boy get . ting ready to go home to my mommy in Queens , and this train is zooming along . I stick my nose and my face against the window and I look down the track . Have you ever had the childlikeness or even just the guts to get up there and look out the front of a train ? It 's fantastic . It 's a great sight , You have this beautiful , dark , long , cool tunnel , and the train charges through it because even though it 's only going maybe thirty or thirty-five miles per hour , if that fast , with the walls only a half a foot away it seems like it 's charging at a hundred miles an hour . At the far end you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it 's really dark , you can see all kinds of red and green traffic and signal lights . They look like beautiful stars or jewels off in the distance . All of a sudden everything disappears , and it 's just me and this train . And all of a sudden , I 'm driving this train . I feel my fingers kind of twitching and I wish I had the same kind of steering wheel Herbie has . About halfway along , in Astoria , I 'm really into it . I 'm driving this train and these beautiful lights are ahead of me in this dark tunnel . Then all of a sudden I pass one of those spots ? you know , where you can see a train coming in the other direction because there 's not a wall in between  --  and the train slows down a little bit , and / see another train coming in the distance . I look in the front window and who do I see but Herbie driving the train the other way ! 1 could n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and closer , and then I know he sees me . I see him with his steering wheel , he 's driving the train , he sees me , I 'm driving this train , and it was a moment of identification I can not describe to you . The kind of moment known to only a great star-fleet commander , Captain Kirk , or the leader of a great squad of airplanes , Colonel Doolittle . It 's a moment that only a few people have in common . We 're both driving these powerful machines , many lives depend on us , the destiny perhaps of the universe , and we 're coming closer and closer , and he lifts his hand , smiles and waves at me , and I forget everything . I forget my self-consciousness . I forget I 'm not a retard . I forget he is a retard . I forget I 'm a wimp . I raise my hand and we give each other a salute , kind of a grim but professional understanding that two great men , responsible for the destinies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JEFFREY ESSMANN was born in the Midwest ? " a /and of jumbo cashews and toy collies " ? and has performed his one-man shows at Dixon Place and La Mama theaters . HEAVEN AND MR . TAYLOR My brother wore a bracelet . A little silver one with his name , address , and birth date on it . My sister had one , too , and every time she 'd show it to me she 'd jerk her hair behind her ear except for a few strands that always got stuck on the corner of her mouth . l 'd say she looked like a spaz . She 'd say she wanted that to happen . So they both had these bracelets . Death bracelets . If anything ever happened to them , like if they ever hid in a pile of leaves by the curb and a car parked on them , these bracelets would identify what was left . My parents did n't get me a bracelet , I was n't the kind of kid who figured they 'd realize how much they loved me if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured they 'd realize how much they loved me if my brother and sister were dead . But I do n't think I wanted them dead . I do n't think so . I just wanted them gone , and besides , something about kidnapping had always appealed to me . Lying in the lower bunk at night , sucking my thumb , I 'd pictured it a million times : the car pulling over , the door opening , the smell of chocolate and stale Old Spice , tobacco-stained teeth ? " Your mother sent me to pick you up from school . " I 'd know I was supposed to scratch the license number in the dirt , but just as I reached for the stick a hand would grab my wrist . Timex watch . He 'd smile ar me  --  and I think I 'd smile back . I 'd wake up with teeth prints in my thumb . It was hot the afternoon I met Mr. Taylor . I 'd been playing with my doctor kit , I 'd eaten all my pills and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just the pills . But it was n't ; it was Good Humor . The truck was halfway down the block . I jumped the porch railing and ran across the lawn . Just as reached the edge , my foot caught the handle of my wagon , and I came down hard on the sidewalk . There was blood . The truck pulled over and Taylor jumped out . " You okay , kid ? " But I could n't hear him through the bells and the blood pounding in my head . just kept watching the red leak out of my knee and hoping that a whole bunch of ants would n't come out of the lawn and eat me . Taylor ran to the truck and came back with a handful of ice shavings and a grape popsicle . When the ice touched my knee I wanted to cry , but I would n't . Not in front of him . " Anything else I can do for you , kid ? " " Yeah , you can turn off those goddamn bells . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an all-right guy , like any chump in the ice-cream racket . He could n't have been more than sixteen . He wore a spiffy white suit and had a goofy sneer of a smile that showed off a chipped front tooth . I liked that . But then I liked anyone with teeth problems since I had lost most of mine that year . I was still wearing my little stethoscope . He flipped it and said , " So you 're a doctor , huh ? " My lips were turning purple . There were heat bugs . I said , " Yeah , lemme check your heart , " I put the stethoscope right over a chocolate stain on his front pocket and  --  cross my heart  --  I could hear it heating . Then my stupid brother came out in his Zorro outfit . My sister was right behind him in a hula skirt and handcuffs . " Mom says you 're supposed to pick up all this stuff and come in the house . " Something about the way he was waving his arm made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my eyes . I do n't know , I guess 1 went crazy for a second . I shoved the bloody ice right in his face and said , " Look , real blood ! " My sister screamed , my brother said he was telling , and both of them ran in the house . " I guess I better go in . Thanks for saving my knee and stuff . " I turned to go in the house . The heat bugs were screaming . Taylor said , " If I had a brother like that , I 'd kill him . " " You would ? You , uh , you got ta push popsicles all afternoon or you get some time off ? " " I get off later this afternoon . " " Yeah ? Why ' oncha meet me at Parker 's drugstore when the big hand is on the twelve and the
