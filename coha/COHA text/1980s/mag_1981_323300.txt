Reaganomics and rapid money growth give Wall Street the jitters <P> Already orbiting at altitudes unimaginable a few short years ago , interest rates moved even higher last week and threatened to shoot the moon . The commercial bank prime lending rate rose to 19% , not far below the record 21.5% set in December . Rates for other financial instruments such as six-month Treasury bills were near record highs . By almost any measure , the cost of money , the lubricant for the U.S. economic engine , was high and heading higher . <P> There was no mystery about the sharp rises , at least in hindsight . Sensing that the U.S. economy is fundamentally strong and in no danger of recession , businessmen and consumers have stepped up short-term borrowing . Consumer credit in March increased by $3.1 billion to $310.8 billion , and bank loans to businesses rose in April by $1.9 billion to $170.1 billion . <P> But when the Federal Reserve published figures reflecting that increased loan demand and money growth , American financiers reacted nervously . The report showed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called M1B and includes money in circulation , checking accounts and checklike NOW deposits at thrift institutions , had grown by a stunning $4.2 billion to $431 billion in the third week of April . <P> Economists , who had been seeing signs of a slowdown in March and April after a strong January and February , had been predicting money supply declines for over a month as credit demand slackened . When this did not happen , it stirred momentary fears that the Federal Reserve had lost control of the nation 's currency and that more inflation and higher interest rates were on the way . <P> The U.S. central bank moved swiftly to counter the expansion in the money supply . On Monday it raised its discount rate from 13% to a record 14% . Banks that borrow from the central bank to meet their own reserve requirements will now have to pay that rate , plus a 4% penalty if they borrow too frequently , bringing the total cost of funds to some banks to 18% . At the same time , the central bank allowed the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans to each other , to rise above 20% . The hoped-for result of last week 's action : borrowing will lessen , demand for goods and services will ease , the economy will slow down , and inflation will ameliorate . <P> Laudable though these goals may be , the Fed 's action was not joyously welcomed on Wall Street , where investors have much the same attitude toward escalating interest rates as W.C. Fields had toward children and small animals . The day of the discount rate hike , the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 16 points ; the next day it lost another 7 . There was some recovery as the week wore on , and the Dow closed Friday at 976.40 , still well below its high this year of 1024 , set only a few days before the discouraging money-supply report .
