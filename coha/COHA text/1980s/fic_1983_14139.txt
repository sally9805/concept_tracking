Gavel . ) JOANNA LU ( On camera ) The jury has been selected quickly for the Dan White trial . It appears the prosecution and the defense want the same jury . Assistant D.A . Tom Norman exercised only three out of twenty-seven possible peremptory challenges . By all accounts , there are no blacks , no gays and no Asians . One juror is an ex-policeman , another the wife of the county jailer , four of the seven women are old enough to be Dan White 's mother . Most of the jurors are working- and middle-class Catholics . Speculation in the press box is that the prosecution feels it has a law-and-order jury . In any case , Dan White will certainly be judged by a jury of his peers .

Norman and I am the Assistant District Attorney , and I appear here as trial representative to Joseph Freitas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Falzon , Chief Inspector of Homicide for San Francisco.George R. Moscone was the duly elected Mayor of San Francisco . ( Screen : Portrait of Moscone . ) Harvey Milk was the duly elected Supervisor or City Councilman of District 5 of San Francisco . ( Screen : Portrait of Milk . ) The defendant in this case , Mr. Daniel James White , had been the duly elected Supervisor of District 8 of San Francisco , until for personal reasons of his own he tendered his resignation in writing to the mayor on or about November the 10th , 1978 , which was approximately seventeen days before this tragedy occurred.Subsequent to tendering his resignation he had the feeling that he wanted to withdraw that resignation , and that he wanted his job back.George Moscone , it appears , had told the accused that he would give him his job back or , in other words , appoint him back to the board if it appeared that there was substantial support in District Number 8 for that appointment.Material was received by the mayor in that regard , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts in an effort to withdraw his written resignation . It appears that those efforts were not met with much success . ( Screen : " The Defense , Douglas Schmidt . " ) p. 12 SCHMIDT Ladies and Gentlemen , the prosecutor has quite skillfully outlined certain of the facts that he believes will be supportive of his theory of first-degree murder.I intend to present all the facts , including some of the background material that will show , not so much what happened on November 27th , but why those tragedies occurred on November 27th.The evidence will show , and it 's not disputed , that Dan White did , indeed , shoot and kill George Moscone and I think the evidence is equally clear that Dan White did shoot and kill Harvey Milk . Why then should there be a trial ? The issue in this trial is properly to understand why that happened . ( Lights . Screen : " Chief Medical Examiner and Coroner for the City and County of San Francisco . " ) CORONER STEPHENS ( Holding photo ) In my opinion and experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mayor 's head is compatible with a firing distance of about one foot , and the smaller tattoo pattern within the larger tattoo pattern is consistent with a firing distance of a little less than one foot.That is : The wounds to the head were received within a distance of one foot when the mayor was already on the floor incapacitated . ( Norman looks to jury . Screen : Image of figure shooting man in head from a distance of one foot , leaning down . Lights. ) p. 13 SCHMIDT Why ? Good people , fine people , with fine backgrounds , simply do n't kill people in cold blood , it just does n't happen , and obviously some part of them has not been presented thus far . Dan White was a native of San Francisco . He went to school here , went through high school here . He was a noted athlete in high school . He was an army veteran who served in Vietnam , and was honorably discharged from the army . He became a policeman thereafter , and after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in San Francisco , and later transferred to the fire department.He was married in December of 1976 , and he fathered his son in July 1978 . Dan White was a good policeman and Dan White was a good fireman . In fact , he was decorated for having saved a woman and her child in a very dangerous fire , but the complete picture of Dan White perhaps was not known until sometime after these tragedies on November 27th . The part that went unrecognized was  --  for the past ten years Daniel White was suffering from a mental disease . The disease that Daniel White was suffering from is called " depression , " sometimes called " manic depression . " ( Lights . ) NORMAN Doctor , what kind of wound was that in your opinion ? CORONER STEPHENS These are gunshot wounds of entrance , Counsel.The cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds particularly the bullet that passed through the base of the supervisor 's brain . This wound would cause instant or almost instant death . I am now holding People 's 30 for identification . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supervisor 's left arm has to be in close to the body with the palm up . The right arm has to be relatively close to the body with the palm turned away from the body and the thumb in towards the body . p. 14 NORMAN Can you illustrate that for us ? CORONER STEPHENS Yes , Counsel . The left arm has to be in close to the body and slightly forward with the palm up . The right hand has to be palm away with the thumb pointed towards the body and the elbow in slightly to the body with the arm raised . In this position , all of these wounds that I have just described in People 's 30 and 29 line up . ( Freeze . Lights . ) SCHMIDT ( Talking to jury ) Dan White came from a vastly different lifestyle than Harvey Milk , who was a homosexual leader and politician . Dan White was an idealistic young man , a working-class young man . He was deeply endowed with and believed very strongly in the traditional American values , family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indicates jury ) Dan White believed people when they said something . He believed that a man 's word , essentially , was his bond . He was an honest man , and he was fair , perhaps too fair for politics in San Francisco . ( Screen : White campaigning , American flag behind him . Audio : Rocky theme song , crowd response throughout his speech . ) WHITE ( To crowd ) Do you like my new campaign song ? CROWD ( Audio ; cheering ) Yeah ! p. 15 WHITE ( To camera ; TV lights ) For years , we have witnessed an exodus from San Francisco by many of our family members , friends and neighbors . Alarmed by the enormous increase in crime , poor educational facilities and a deteriorating social structure , they have fled to temporary havens In a few short years these malignancies of society will erupt from our city and engulf our tree-lined , sun-bathed communities that chide us for daring to live in San Francisco . That is , unless we who have remained can transcend the apathy which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rages unchecked through our streets . Individually we are helpless . Yet you must realize there are thousands and thousands of angry frustrated people such as yourselves waiting to unleash a fury that can and will eradicate the malignancies which blight our beautiful city . I am not going to be forced out of San Francisco by splinter groups of radicals , social deviates and incorrigibles . UNITE AND FIGHT WITH DAN WHITE . ( Crowd cheers . Lights change . Screens go to white . ) SCHMIDT I think Dan White saw the city deteriorating as a place for the average and decent people to live . JUDGE Mr. Nothenberg , please be seated . SCHMIDT This irony is that the young man with so much promise in seeking the job on the Board of Supervisors actually was destined to construct his downfall . After Dan White was elected he discovered there was a conflict of interest if he was a fireman and an elected official . His wife , Mary Ann , was a schoolteacher and made a good salary . But after their marriage , it was discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to give up her teaching job . So the family income plummeted from an excess of $30,000 to $9,600 , which is what a San Francisco supervisor is paid . I believe all the stress and the underlying mental illness culminated in his resignation that he turned in to the mayor on November 10th , 1978 . ( Screen : " Mr. Nothenberg , Deputy Mayor . " Lights. ) p. 16 NORMAN Would you read that for us ? NOTHENBERG " Dear Mayor Moscone : I have been proud to represent the people of San Francisco from District 8 for the past ten months , but due to personal responsibilities which I feel must take precedent over my legislative duties , I am resigning my position effective today . I am sure that the next representative to the Board of Supervisors will receive as much support from the People of San Francisco as I have . Sincerely , Dan White . " It is so signed . SCHMIDT ( To jury ) Some days after November the 10th pressure was brought to bear on Dan White to go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was a one-way course that those persons could appeal to Dan White , and that was to appeal to his sense of honor : Basically  --  Dan you are letting the fire department down , letting the police department down . It worked . That type of pressure worked , because of the kind of man Dan White is.He asked the mayor for his job back . NORMAN Mr. Nothenberg , on or about Monday the 27th of November last year , do you know whether Mayor Moscone was going to make an appointment to the Board of Supervisors , particularly for District Number 8 ? NOTHENBERG Yes , he was . SCHMIDT The mayor said : We have political differences , but you are basically a good man , and you worked for the job and I 'm not going to take you to fault . The letter was returned to Dan White . p. 17 NORMAN Do you know whom his appointee to District 8 was going to be ? NOTHENBERG Yes , I do . NORMAN Who was that please ? NOTHENBERG It was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , Dan White believed a man 's word was his bond . ( He moves down to the jury ) Mayor Moscone had said : If there was any legal problem he would simply reappoint Dan White . Thereafter it became : Dan White there is no support in District 8 and unless you can show some broad-base support , the job will not be given to you , and finally , the public statement coming from the mayor 's office : It 's undecided . But you will be notified , prior to the time that any decision is made . They did n't tell Dan White . But they told Barbara Taylor . ( Lights change . ) TAYLOR ( Audio ; on phone ) I 'm Barbara Taylor from KCBS . I 'd like to speak to Dan White . WHITE ( Audio ) Yuh . TAYLOR ( Audio ) I have received information from a source within the mayor 's office that you are not getting that job . I am interested in doing an interview to find out your reaction to that Mr. White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 WHITE ( Audio ) I do n't know anything about it . ( Audio : Click , busy signal . Lights change . ) TAYLOR ( Live ) The Mayor told me : " The only one I 've talked to who is in favor of the appointment of Dan White is Dan White . " NORMAN Thank you , Miss Taylor . SCHMIDT After that phone call , Denise Apcar , Dan 's aide , told Dan White that there were going to be supporters down at City Hall the next morning to show support to the mayor 's office . In one day they had collected eleven hundred signatures in District 8 in support of Dan White.But the next morning , Denise called Dan and told him the mayor was unwilling to accept the petitioners . ( Screen : " Denise Apcar , Aide to Dan White . " ) APCAR Yes . I told Danny  --  I do n't remember my exact words  --  that the mayor had " circumvented the people . " NORMAN Did you believe at that time that the mayor was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . NORMAN At that time , were your feelings such that you were angry ? APCAR Definitely . Well the mayor had told him and Dan always felt that a person was going to be honest when they said something . He believed that up until the end . p. 19 NORMAN You felt and believed that Mr. Milk had been acting to prevent the appointment of Mr. Dan White to his vacated seat on the Board of Supervisors ? APCAR Yes . I was very much aware of that . NORMAN Had you expressed that opinion to Mr. White ? APCAR Yes . NORMAN Did Mr. White ever express that opinion also to you ? APCAR He was n't down at City Hall very much that week so I was basically the person that told him these things . ( Pause . ) NORMAN Did you call Mr. White and tell him that you had seen Harvey Milk come out of the mayor 's office after you had been informed the mayor was not in ? APCAR Yes , I did . Then he called me back and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see the mayor . " NORMAN When you picked him up , did he do anything unusual ? APCAR Well he did n't look at me and normally he would turn his body a little bit towards the driver and we would talk , you know , in a freeform way , but this time he did n't look at me at all . He was squinting hard . He was very nervous , he was agitated . He was blowing a lot . He was rubbing his hands , blowing into his hands and rubbing them like he was cold , like his hands were cold . He acted very hurt . Yes . He was , he looked like he was going to cry . He was doing everything he could to restrain his emotion . p. 20 NORMAN Did you ever describe him as acting " all fired up " ? APCAR Yes , yes I  --  I believe I said that . NORMAN Did he mention at that time that he also was going to talk to Harvey Milk ? APCAR Yes , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " really lay it on the mayor " ? APCAR It 's been brought to my attention I said that , yes . NORMAN When you were driving Mr. White downtown , was there some discussion relative to a statement you made . " Anger had run pretty high all week towards the mayor playing pool on us , dirty , you know ? " APCAR I believe I was describing my anger . At the time I made those statements I was in shock and I spoke freely and I 'm sure I 've never used those terms before . NORMAN When you made those statements it was forty minutes after noon on November 27th , was it not ? APCAR Yes . NORMAN Miss Apcar  --  When you were driving Mr. White to City Hall did you know he was carrying a loaded gun ? APCAR No . I did not . NORMAN Thank you . ( Lights. ) p. 21 SCHMIDT Dan White went to City Hall and he took a .38 caliber revolver with him , and that was not particularly unusual for Dan White.Dan White was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry , off-duty , a gun , and as an ex-policeman  --  well , I think it 's common practice.And additionally , remember , there was the atmosphere created by the Jonestown People 's Temple tragedy , ( Screens flood with Jonestown imagery . Music. ) which had occurred a few days before November 27th , and at that time there were rumors that there were hit lists that had been placed on public officials in San Francisco . Assassination squads . And in hindsight of course we can all realize the fact did not happen , but at the time there were nine hundred bodies laying in Guyana to indicate , that indeed , people were bent on murder . ( Screen : " Officer Byrne , Department of Records . " Lights . ) NORMAN Officer Byrne , do persons who were once on the police force who have resigned their positions , do they have a right to carry a concealed firearm on their person ? SCHMIDT And I think it will be shown that Jim Jones himself was directly allied to the liberal elements of San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BYRNE No , a resigned person would not have that right . p. 22 SCHMIDT And so , it would be important to understand that there were threats directed towards conservative persons like Dan White . NORMAN Officer , have you at my instance and request examined those particular records to determine whether there is an official permit issued by the Chief of Police to a Mr. Daniel James White to carry a concealed firearm ? OFFICER BYRNE Yes , I have . NORMAN What have you found ? OFFICER BYRNE I find no permit . NORMAN Thank you . ( Lights . ) SCHMIDT Yes , it 's a violation of the law to carry a firearm without a permit , but that firearm was registered to Dan White . NORMAN Mr. Melia , please be seated . SCHMIDT Upon approaching the doors on Polk Street , White observed a metal-detection machine.Knowing that he did not know the man that was on the metal-detection machine , he simply went around to the McAllister Street well , where he expected to meet his aide.He did not find Denise Apcar there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He waited for several moments , but knowing that it was imminent , the talk to the mayor , he stepped through a window at the Department of Public Works . ( Screen : Slide of windows with man in front demonstrating procedure . ) Which does n't require any physical prowess , and you can step through those windows , and the evidence will show that though now they are barred , previously it was not uncommon for people to enter and exit there . They are very large windows , and are large , wide sills , ( Screen shows windows he stepped through  --  small , high off the ground , now barred. ) and it 's quite easy to step into the building through these windows . ( Screen : Slide of man in three-piece suit trying to get leg up . Screen : " William Melia , Jr. , Civil Engineer . " ) p. 23 MELIA At approximately 10:35 I heard the window open . I heard someone jump to the floor and then running through the adjoining room . I looked up and caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorway of my office into the City Hall hallway . NORMAN What did you do ? MELIA I got up from my desk and called after him : " Hey , wait a second . " NORMAN Did that person wait or stop ? MELIA Yes , they did . NORMAN Do you see that person here in this courtroom today ? MELIA Yes , I do . NORMAN Where is that person ? MELIA It 's Dan White . ( Pause ) He said to me : " I had to get in . My aide was supposed to come down and let me in the side door , but never showed up . " I had taken exception to the way he had entered our office , and I replied : " And you are ? " And he replied : " I 'm Dan White , the city supervisor . " He said , " Say , I 've got to go , " and with that , he turned and ran out of the office . NORMAN Did you say that he ran ? MELIA Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had you ever seen anyone else enter or exit through that window or those windows along that side ? MELIA Yes , I had . It was common for individuals that worked in our office to do that . NORMAN Were you alarmed when you learned that a supervisor crawled or walked through that window , or stepped through that window ? MELIA Was I alarmed ? NORMAN Yes . MELIA Yes . I was alarmed . ( Norman looks to jury . ) SCHMIDT ( Annoyed ) I think it 's significant at this point  --  also because the fact that he crawled through the window appears to be important  --  it 's significant to explain that people often climb through that window , and indeed , on the morning of the 27th , Denise had the key to the McAllister Street well door.So , Dan White stepped through the window , identified himself , traveled up to the second floor .

CYR For that hour of the day there is usually more  --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the second floor and started walking toward the mayor 's office . YOUNG MOTHER I wanted to get them out of school and take them home , NORMAN Could you describe these noises for us ? YOUNG MOTHER I wanted to take them home and ( Makes a hugging gesture ) lock the door . CYR Well , they were dull thuds rather like  --  DENMAN And there was this strange combination of panic and silence that you rarely see , CYR I thought maybe it was an automobile door that somebody had tried to shut , by , you know , pushing , and then finally succeeding . DENMAN it was like a silent slow-motion movie of a disaster . p. 29 NORMAN Do you have any recollection that you can report with any certainty to us as to how many sounds there were ? CYR No . As I stood there I  --  I thought I ought to remember  --  ( She breaks down . ) DENMAN There was this hush and aura , people were moving with strange faces , ( Cyr sobs. ) as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRIEND George loved this city , and felt what was wrong could be fixed . NORMAN Do you want a glass of water ? ( Cyr sobs . ) DENMAN And I asked someone what had happened and he said : " The mayor has been shot . " CYR I ought to remember that pattern in case it is something , but I  --  MOSCONE 'S FRIEND He knew  --  it was a white racist town . A Catholic town . But he believed in people 's basic good will . ( Cyr sobs . ) JUDGE Just a minute . Do you want a recess ? MOSCONE 'S FRIEND He never suspected , I bet , Dan White 's psychotic behavior . NORMAN Do you want a recess ? p. 30 MOSCONE 'S FRIEND That son of a bitch killed someone I loved . I mean , I loved the guy . CYR No , I 'm all right . JUDGE Are you sure you are all right ? CYR Yes . YOUNG MOTHER I just thought of my kids . ( Long pause . ) MOSCONE 'S FRIEND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CYR Then what happened was Rudy Nothenberg left to tell the press that the conference would start a few minutes late . MOSCONE 'S FRIEND I loved the guy . CYR And then he came back to me right away and said : " Oh , I guess we can go ahead . I just saw Dan White leave . " MOSCONE 'S FRIEND I loved his almost naive faith in people . CYR So then he went into the mayor 's office and said : " He is n't here . " And I said : " Well , maybe he went into the back room . " MOSCONE 'S FRIEND I loved his ability to go on . CYR Then he just gave a shout saying : " Gary , get in here . Call an ambulance , Get the police . " MOSCONE 'S FRIEND See , I got too tired to stay in politics and do it . George and I were together from the beginning . Me , Phil Burton , Willy Brown . Beatin ' all the old Irishmen . p. 31 DENMAN I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S FRIEND But George believed , as corny as this sounds , that you do good for the people . I have n't met many of those and George was one of those . Maybe those are the guys that get killed . I do n't know . ( Pause . Cyr crying . ) NORMAN All right . All this you told us about occurred in San Francisco , did n't it ? ( Pause . ) CYR ( Deeply moved ) Yes . SCHMIDT Dan White , as it was quite apparent at that point , had cracked because of his underlying mental illness ( Screen : " Carl Henry Carlson , Aide to Harvey Milk . " ) CARLSON I heard Peter Nardoza , Dianne Feinstein 's aide , say " Dianne wants to see you , " and Dan White said : " That 'll have to wait a couple of minutes , I have something to do first . " NORMAN I have something to do first CARLSON Yes . ( Pause . ) NORMAN Do you recall in what manner Mr. White announced himself ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't been notified . p. 32 CARLSON He appeared at the door , which was normally left open . Stuck his head in and asked : " Say , Harv , can I see you for a minute ? " SCHMIDT and the sudden emotional surge that he had in the mayor 's office was simply too much for him NORMAN What did Harvey Milk do at that time if anything ? CARLSON He turned around . SCHMIDT and he cracked . CARLSON He turned around SCHMIDT The man cracked . CARLSON and said " Sure , " and got up and went across the hall SCHMIDT He shot the mayor , CARLSON to the office designated as Dan White 's office on the chart . SCHMIDT reloaded his gun , basically on instinct , because of his police training . NORMAN After they went across the hall to Mr. White 's office SCHMIDT and was about to leave the building at that point and he looked down the hall , NORMAN Would you tell us what next you heard or saw ? SCHMIDT he saw somebody that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33 CARLSON A few seconds later , probably ten , fifteen seconds later , I heard a shot , or the sound of gunfire . SCHMIDT He went down to the supervisors ' area to talk to Harvey Milk . JUDGE Excuse me . Would you speak out . Your voice is fading a bit . SCHMIDT At that point , in the same state of rage , emotional up-heaval with the stress and mental illness having cracked this man CORONER STEPHENS ( Demonstrates as he speaks ) The left arm has to be close to the body and slightly forward with the palm up . SCHMIDT ninety seconds from the time he shot the mayor , Dan White shot and killed Harvey Milk . CARLSON After the shot , I heard Harvey Milk scream . " Oh , no . " And then the first  --  the first part of the second " no " which was then cut short by the second shot . CORONER STEPHENS The right hand has to be palm away with the thumb pointed towards the body and the elbow in slightly to the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots did you hear altogether , Mr. Carlson ? CARLSON Five or six . I really did n't consciously count them . p. 34 CORONER STEPHENS In this position all of these wounds that I have just described in People 's 29 and 30 line up . ( Pause . ) CARLSON A few moments later the door opened , the door opened and Daniel White walked out , rushed out , and proceeded down the hall . NORMAN Now , Mr. Carlson , when Daniel White first appeared at the office of Harvey Milk and he inquired of Harvey Milk , " Say , Harv , can I see you for a minute ? " could you describe his tone of voice in any way ? CARLSON He appeared to be very normal , usual friendly self . I did n't , I did n't feel anything out of the ordinary . It was just very typical Dan White . ( Lights change . ) CRAIG I 'd like to talk about when people are pushed to the wall . SCHMIDT Harvey Milk was against the reappointment of Dan White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you have to understand that the Dan White verdict did not occur in a vacuum . SCHMIDT Basically , it was a political decision . It was evident there was a liberal wing of the Board of Supervisors , and there was a smaller conservative wing , and Dan White was a conservative politician for San Francisco . ( Screen : " Richard Pabich , Legislative Assistant to Harvey Milk . " Lights. ) p. 35 PABICH My address is 542-A Castro Street . CRAIG I do n't think I have to say what their presence meant to us , and what their loss meant to us  --  NORMAN What did you do after you saw Dan White put the key in the door of his old office , Room 237 ? CRAIG The assassinations of our friends Harvey and George were a crime against us all . PABICH Well , I was struck in my head , sort of curious as to why he 'd been running . CRAIG And right here , when I say " us , " I do n't mean only gay people . PABICH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hurry . I was aware of the political situation . CRAIG I mean all people who are getting less than they deserve . PABICH I was aware that Harvey was taking the position to the mayor that Mr. White should n't be reappointed . Harvey and I had talked earlier that it would be a significant day . ( Lights . Subliminal music . ) MILK 'S FRIEND After Harvey died , I went into a depression that lasted about a year , I guess . They called it depression , anyway . I thought about suicide , well , I more than thought about it . p. 36 SCHMIDT Mr. Pabich , Mr. Milk had suggested a replacement for Dan White , had n't he ? PABICH He had , to my understanding , recommended several people , and basically took the position that Dan White should not be reappointed . MILK 'S FRIEND I lost my job . I stayed in the hospital for , I would guess , two months or so . They put me on some kind of drug that well , it helped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was SCHMIDT Was he requesting that a homosexual be appointed ? PABICH No , he was not .

MILK 'S FRIEND He 'd never be here again , I knew that . JUDGE All right . Any redirect , Mr. Norman ? NORMAN No . Thank you for coming , Mr. Pabich . CRAIG It was as if Dan White had given the go-ahead . It was a free-for-all , a license to kill . MILK 'S FRIEND I had this recurring dream . We were at the opera , Harvey and I. ( Pabich with Joanna Lu . TV lights. ) p. 37 PABICH ( On camera ) It 's over . Already I can tell it 's over . He asked me a question , a clear queer-baiting question , and the jury did n't bat an eye . MILK 'S FRIEND I was laughing . Harvey was laughing . PABICH ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with murder .

( Blackout . Hyperrealistic sounds of high heels on marble , echoing , moving fast . Mumbled Hail Marys . Lights up slowly on Schmidt , Norman . ) SCHMIDT From here I think the evidence will demonstrate that Dan White ran down to Denise 's office , screamed at his aide to give him the key to her car.And he left , went to a church , called his wife , went into St. Mary 's Cathedral , prayed , and his wife got there , and he told her , the best he could , what he remembered he had done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he turned himself in ; asked the officer to look after his wife , asked the officer to take possession of an Irish poster he was carrying ( Screen : Cover of Uris book Ireland : A Terrible Beauty . Desolate , haunting. ) and then made a statement , what best he could recall had occurred . ( Lights . Falzon rises from his seat at prosecutor 's table. ) p. 38 FALZON Why I feel like hitting you in the fuckin ' mouth . How could you be so stupid ? How ? WHITE I I want to tell you about it I want to , to explain . FALZON Okay , if you want to talk to me , I 'm gon na get my tape recorder and read you your rights and do it right . NORMAN The People at this time move the tape-recorded statement into evidence . ( Screen : " The Confession . " ) FALZON Today 's date is Monday , November 27th , 1978 . The time is presently 12:05 . We 're inside the Homicide Detail , Room 454 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erdelatz , Inspector Frank Falzon and for the record , sir , your full name ? WHITE Daniel James White . ( Lights . ) FALZON Would you , normally in a situation like this , ah we ask questions , I 'm aware of your past history as a police officer and also as a San Francisco fireman . I would prefer . I 'll let you do it in a narrative form as to what happened this morning if you can lead up to the events of the shooting and then backtrack as to why these events took place . ( Looks at Erdelatz ) p. 39 WHITE Well , it 's just that I 've been under an awful lot of pressure lately , financial pressure , because of my job situation , family pressure because of ah not being able to have the time with my family . ( Sobs ) FALZON Can you relate these pressures you 've been under , Dan , at this time ? Can you explain it to Inspector Erdelatz and myself . WHITE It 's just that I wanted to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I did that . Then when the pressures got too great , I decided to leave . After I left , my family and friends offered their support and said , what-ever it would take to allow me to go back into office  --  well , they would be willing to make that effort . And then it came out that Supervisor Milk and some others were working against me to get my seat back on the board . He did n't speak to me , he spoke to the city attorney but I was in the office and I heard the conversation.I could see the game that was being played , they were going to use me as a scapegoat , whether I was a good supervisor or not , was not the point . This was a political opportunity and they were going to degrade me and my family and the job that I had tried to do an ' , an ' more or less hang me out to dry . And I saw more and more evidence of this during the week when the papers reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mayor told me he was going to call me before he made any decision , he never did that . I was troubled , the pressure , my family again , my , my son 's out to a babysitter. p. 40 FALZON Dan , can you tell Inspector Erdelatz and myself , what was your plan this morning ? What did you have in mind ? WHITE I did n't have any devised plan or anything , It 's , I was leaving the house to talk , to see the mayor and I went downstairs , to , to make a phone call and I had my gun down there . FALZON Is this your police service revolver , Dan ? WHITE This is the gun I had when I was a policeman . It 's in my room an ' ah I do n't know , I just put it on . I , I do n't know why I put it on , it 's just FALZON You went directly from your residence to the mayor 's office this morning ? WHITE Yes , my , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any idea ah you know that I had a gun on me or , you know , and I went in to see him an ' , an ' he told me he was n't going to , intending to tell me about it . Then ah I got kind of fuzzy and then just my head did n't feel right and I , then he said : " Let 's go into the , the back room and , and have a drink and talk about it . " FALZON Was this before any threats on your part , Dan ? WHITE I , I never made any threats . FALZON There were no threats at all ? p. 41 WHITE I , I oh no . FALZON When were you , how , what was the conversation , can you explain to Inspector Erdelatz and myself the conversation that existed between the two of you at this time ? WHITE It was pretty much just , you know , I asked , was I going to be reappointed . He said , no I am not , no you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told me , it 's a political decision and that 's the end of it , and that 's it . FALZON Is this when you were having a drink in the back room ? WHITE No , no , it 's before I went into the back room and then he could obviously see , see I was obviously distraught an ' then he said , let 's have a drink an ' I , I 'm not even a drinker , you know I do n't , once in a while , but I 'm not even a drinker . But I just kinda stumbled in the back and he was all , he was talking an ' nothing was getting through to me . It was just like a roaring in my ears an ' , an ' then em it just came to me , you know , he FALZON You could n't hear what he was saying , Dan ? WHITE Just small talk that , you know , it just was n't registering . What I was going to do now , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , an ' , an ' just , just all the time knowing he 's going to go out an ' , an ' lie to the press an ' , an ' tell ' em , you know , that I , I was n't a good supervisor and that people did n't want me an ' then that was it . Then I , I just shot him , that was it , it was over . p. 42 FALZON What happened after you left there , Dan ? WHITE Well , I , I left his office by one of the back doors an ' , I was going down the stairs and then I saw Harvey Milk 's aide an ' then it struck me about what Harvey had tried to do an ' I said , well I 'll go talk to him . He did n't know I had , I had heard his conversation and he was all smiles and stuff and I went in and , you know , I , I did n't agree with him on a lot of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here they were devious . I started to say you know how hard I worked for it and what it meant to me and my family an ' then my reputation as , as a hard worker , good honest person and he just kind of smirked at me as if to say , too bad an ' then , an ' then , I just got all flushed an ' , an ' hot , and I shot him . FALZON This occurred inside your room , Dan ? WHITE Yeah , in my office , yeah . FALZON And when you left there did you go back home ? WHITE No , no , no I drove to the , the Doggie Diner on , on Van Ness and I called my wife and she , she did n't know , she FALZON Did you tell her Dan ? ( Sobbing . ) WHITE I called up , I did n't tell her on the phone . I just said she was work see , she was working , son 's at a baby-sitter , shit . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 43 FALZON St. Mary 's ? ( Sobbing . ) WHITE She took a cab , yeah . She did n't know . She knew I 'd been upset and I was n't even talking to her at home because I just could n't explain how I felt and she had no , nothing to blame about it , she was , she always has been great to me but it was , just the pressure hitting me an ' just my head 's all flushed and expected that my skull 's going to crack . Then when she came to the church , I , I told her and she kind of slumped and she , she could n't say anything . FALZON How is she now do you , do you know is she , do you know where she is ? WHITE I do n't know now . She , she came to Northern Station with me . She asked me not to do anything about myself , you know that she , she loved me and she 'd stick by me and not to hurt myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add at this time ? WHITE Just that I 've been honest and worked hard , never cheated anybody or , you know , I 'm not a crook or anything an ' I wanted to do a good job , I 'm trying to do a good job an ' I saw this city as it 's going , kind of downhill an ' I was always just a lonely vote on the board and try to be honest an ' , an ' I just could n't take it anymore an ' that 's it . FALZON Inspector Erdelatz ? p. 44 ERDELATZ Dan , right now are you under a doctor 's care ? WHITE No . ERDELATZ Are you under any medication at all ? WHITE No . ERDELATZ When is the last time you had your gun with you prior to today ? WHITE I guess it was a few months ago . I , I was afraid of some of the threats that were made an ' , I , I , just wanted to make sure to protect myself you know this , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of people running around an ' well I do n't have to tell you fellows , you guys know that . ERDELATZ When you left your home this morning Dan , was it your intention to confront the mayor , Supervisor Milk or anyone else with that gun ? WHITE No , I , I , what I wanted to do was just , talk to him , you know , I , I ah , I did n't even know if I was going to be reappointed or not be reappointed . Why do we do things , you know , why did I , I do n't know . No , I , I just wanted to talk to him that 's all an ' at least have him be honest with me an ' tell me why he was doing it , not because I was a bad supervisor or anything but , you know , I never killed anybody before . I never shot anybody ERDELATZ Why did p. 45 WHITE I did n't even , I did n't even know if I wanted to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . ERDELATZ What type of gun is that you were carrying , Dan ?

WHITE I reloaded in my office when , when I was I could n't out in the hall . ( Pause . ) ERDELATZ And how many bullets did you have with you ? WHITE I , I , I do n't know , I ah the gun was loaded an ' , an ' , I had some ah extra shots you know , I just , I , ' cause , I kept the gun with , with a box of shells and just grabbed some . ERDELATZ Inspector Falzon ? FALZON No questions . Is there anything you 'd like to add , Dan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just that , I never really intended to hurt anybody . It 's just this past several months , it got to the point I could n't take it and I never wanted the job for ego or , you know , perpetuate myself or anything like that .

( Falzon switches tape off . ) NORMAN I think that is all . You may examine . ( Lights change . Screen : " Inspector Frank Falzon , Witness for the Prosecution . " Screen : " Act Two : In Defense of Murder . " ) SCHMIDT Inspector Falzon , you mentioned that you had known Dan White in the past , prior to November 27th , 1978 ? FALZON Yes , sir , quite well . SCHMIDT About how long have you known him ? FALZON According to Dan , it goes way back to the dayswe attended St. Elizabeth 's Grammar School together , butwe went to different high schools.I attended St. Ignatius , and he attended Riordan.He walked up to me one day at the Jackson Playground , with spikes over his shoulders , glove in his hand , and asked if he could play on my team.I told him it was the police team , and he stated that he was a new recruit at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team , and since that day Dan White and Ihave been very good friends . p. 49 SCHMIDT You knew him fairly well then , that is fair ? FALZON As well as I know anybody , I believed . SCHMIDT Can you tell me , when you saw him first on November 27th , 1978 , how did he appear physically to you ? FALZON Destroyed . This was not the Dan White I had known , not at all.That day I saw a shattered individual , both mentally and physically in appearance , who appeared to me to be shattered . Dan White , the man I knewprior to Monday , the 27th of November , 1978 , was a man among men . SCHMIDT Knowing , with regard to the shootings of Mayor Moscone and Harvey Milk , knowing Dan White as you did , is he the type of man that could have premeditatedly and deliberately shot those people ? NORMAN Objection as calling for an opinion and conclusion . JUDGE Sustained . SCHMIDT Knowing him as you do , have you ever seen anything in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cold-bloodedly shooting somebody ? NORMAN Same objection . JUDGE Sustained . p. 50 SCHMIDT Your Honor , at this point I have anticipated that maybe there would be some argument with regard to opinions not only as to Inspector Falzon , but with a number of other witnesses that I intend to call , and accordingly I have prepared a memorandum of what I believe to be the appropriate law . ( Shows memo ) JUDGE I have no quarrel with your authorities , but I think the form of the questions that you asked were objectionable . SCHMIDT The questions were calculated to bring out an opinion on the state of mind and  --  I believe that a lay person , if he is an intimate acquaintance , surely can hazard such an opinion . I believe that Inspector Falzon , as a police officer , has an opinion . JUDGE Get the facts from this witness . I will let you get those facts , whatever they are . SCHMIDT All right , we will try that . Inspector Falzon , again , you mentioned that you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about the man 's character , as to the man that you knew prior to the  --  prior to November 27th , 1978 ? NORMAN Objection as being irrelevant and vague . JUDGE Overruled . ( To Falzon ) Do you understand the question ? p. 51 FALZON I do , basically , Your Honor . JUDGE All right , you may answer it . NORMAN Well , your Honor , character for what ? JUDGE Overruled . ( To Falzon ) You may answer it . FALZON The Dan White that I knew prior to Monday , November 27 , 1978 , was a man who seemed to excel in pressure situations , and it seemed that the greater the pressure , the more enjoyment that Dan had , exceeding at what he was trying to do . Examples would be in his sports life , that I can relate to , and for the first time in the history of the State of California , there was a law enforcement softball tournament held in 1971 . The San Francisco Police Department enteredthat softball tournament along with other major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only named on the All-Star Teamat the end of the tournament , but named the most valuable player . He was just outstanding under pressure situations , when men would be on base and that clutch hit was needed . At the end of the tournament , a dinner was held , the umpires were invited , and one individual had umpired baseball games for over thirty years , made the comment that Dan Whitewas the best ballplayer he had ever seen participate in any tournament in South Lake Tahoe . Another example of Dan White 's attitude toward pressure was that when he decided to run for the District 8 supervisor 's seat , and I can still vividly remember the morning he walked into the Homicide Detail and sat down to  --  announced that he was gong to run for City Supervisor , I said : " How are you going to do it , Dan ? Nobody heard of Dan White . How are you going to go out there , win this election ? " He said : " I 'm going to do it the way the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , go inside , shake their hands , let them know what Dan White stands for . " And he said : " Dan White is going to represent them.There will be a voice in City Hall , you watch , I 'll make it . " He did what he said he was going to do , he ran , won the election . p. 52 SCHMIDT Given these things that you mentioned about Dan White , was there anything in his character that you saw of him , prior to those tragedies of the 27th of November , that would have led you to believe that he would ever kill somebody cold-bloodedly ? NORMAN Objection , irrelevant . JUDGE Overruled . NORMAN Let me state my grounds for the record . JUDGE Overruled . NORMAN Thank you , Judge . It 's irrelevant and called for his opinion and speculation . JUDGE Overruled . ( To Falzon ) You may answer that . FALZON Yes , Your Honor . I 'm aware  --  I 'm hesitating only because there was something I saw in Dan 's personality that did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had a tendency to run , occasionally , from situations.I saw this flaw , and I asked him about it , and his response was that his ultimate goalwas to purchase a boat , just travel around the world , get away from everybody , and yet the Dan White that I was talking towas trying to be involved with people , constantly being a fireman , being a policeman , being a supervisor.He wanted to be helpful to people , and yet he wanted to run away from them.That did not make sense to me . Today , this is the only flaw in Dan White 's characterthat I can cite up here , and testify about . Otherwise , to me , Dan White was an exemplary individual , a man that I was proud to know and be associated with . p. 53 SCHMIDT Do you think he cracked ? Do you think there was something wrong with him on November 27th ? NORMAN Objection as calling for an opinion and speculation . JUDGE Sustained . SCHMIDT I have nothing further . ( Turns back ) Inspector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him act out of revenge the whole time you have known him ? NORMAN Objection . That calls for speculation . JUDGE No , overruled , and this is as to his observations and contacts . Overruled . FALZON The only time Dan White could have acted out in revenge is when he took the opposite procedurein hurting himself , by quitting the San Francisco Police Department . SCHMIDT Nothing further . Thank you , sir . NORMAN Inspector Falzon , you regard yourself as a close friend to Mr. Daniel White , do n't you ? FALZON Yes , sir . NORMAN Do you regard yourself as a very close friend of Mr. Daniel White ? FALZON I would consider myself a close friend of yours , if that can relate to you my closeness with Dan White . ( Pause . Norman uncomfortable. ) p. 54 NORMAN Of course , you have n't known me as long as you have known Mr. Daniel White , have you , Inspector ? FALZON Just about the same length of time , Counsel . ( Long pause . ) NORMAN Inspector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedies , would you subscribe to the proposition that there 's a first time for everything ? FALZON It 's obvious in this case ; yes , sir .

Lights up . Four character witnesses dressed as City Supervisor ( suit ) &gt; , fire chief , police officer , fireman . ) SHERATT ( Fire chief ) Dan White was an excellent firefighter .

SHERATT but a meritorious advisory board and fire commission were going to present Mr. White with a Class C medal . ( Screen : Still of White as fire hero . ) FREDIANI Everybody liked Dan . SCHMIDT Did you work with Dan as a policeman ? SULLIVAN ( Policeman ) Yes , I did . MILK 'S FRIEND Maybe as a gay man , I understand the tyranny of the All-American Boy . ( Screen : Still of White as police officer . ) FREDIANI He loved sports and I loved sports . ( Screen : Still of White as Golden Gloves boxer . ) SULLIVAN Dan White as a police officer , was a very fair police officer on the street . MILK 'S FRIEND Maybe because I am so often his victim . p. 56 CRAIG I followed the trial in the papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer , is it unusual for persons that have been police officers to carry guns ? SULLIVAN Uh , pardon me , Mr. Schmidt ? CRAIG I thought then something was wrong with this picture . SCHMIDT I say , it is uncommon that ex-police officers would carry guns ? CRAIG Something was wrong , we thought , when the Chief Inspector of Homicide became the chief character witness for the defense . SULLIVAN No , it is a common thing that former police officers will carry guns . CRAIG Why did n't the Chief Inspector of Homicide ask Dan White how he got into City Hall with a loaded gun ? SCHMIDT Without a permit ? SULLIVAN Yes . CRAIG White reloaded after shooting the mayor . If it was " reflex , " police training , why did n't he reload again after shooting Harvey Milk ? SCHMIDT Is there anything in his character that would have led you to believe he was capable of shooting two persons ? NORMAN Objection . p. 57 JUDGE Overruled . SULLIVAN No , nothing whatever . CRAIG And what can explain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads as they lay therehelpless on the floor ? DOLSON ( Supervisor ) Dan in my opinion was a person who saved lives . CRAIG Where is the prosecution ? ( Pause . ) FREITAS I mean , I would have remained in politics . Except for this . I was voted out of office . SCHMIDT ( To Dolson ) Supervisor Dolson , you saw him on November 27th , 1978 , did you not ? DOLSON I did . FREITAS In hindsight , you know , I would have changed a lot of things . SCHMIDT What did you see ? FREITAS But hindsight is always perfect vision . ( Screen : Still of White as City Supervisor outside City Hall . ) DOLSON What I saw made me want to cry Dan was always so neat.Looked like a marine on parade ; and he made me feel ashamed of the way I usually looked , and here he was , this kid , who was badly disheveled , looking like he had been crying . p. 58 CRAIG What pressures were you under indeed ? DOLSON And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never expected to see.He looked crushed , looked like he was absolutely devastated . ( Sobs ) CRAIG As the " victim " sat in the courtroomshielded by bulletproof glass , we heard of policemen and firemen sporting " Free Dan White " T-shirtsas they raised a hundred thousand dollars for Dan White 's defense fund , and the same message began appearing in spray paint on walls around the city.FREE DAN WHITE . DOLSON I put my arm around him , told him that everything was going to be all right , but how everything was going to be all right , I do n't know . ( He is deeply moved ) ( Mary Ann White sobs . ) CRAIG And the trial was still happening , SCHMIDT ( Deeply moved ) Thank you . I have nothing further . ( Dolson sobs . ) CRAIG but the tears at the Hall of Justice are all for Dan White . ( All exit . Lights change . Freitas alone in empty courtroom , nervous , fidgeting. ) p. 59 FREITAS I was voted out of office . ( Screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) Well , I 'm out of politics and I do n't know whetherI 'll get back into politicsbecause it certainly did set back my personal ah aspirations as a public figure dramatically.I do n't know You know , there was an attempt to not allow our office to prosecute the casebecause I was close to Moscone myself.And we fought against that.I was confident  --  ( Laughs ) I chose Tom Norman because he was the seniorhomicide prosecutorfor twenty years and he was quite successful at it. I do n't know There was a great division in the city then , you know.The city was divided all during that period.George was a liberal Democrat and Dick Hongisto.I was considered a liberal Democratand George as you 'll remember was electedmayor over John Barbagelata who was the leaderof what was considered the right in town.And it was a narrow victory.So , after his election , Barbagelata persisted in attacking themand keepingI thought  --  keeping the city divided.It divided on emerging constituencies likethe gay constituency.That 's the one that was used to cause the most divisiveemotions more than any other.So the divisiveness in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of this political fightbetween Dan Whiteand Moscone and Milk:The fight was over who controlled the city . The right could n't afford to lose Dan.He was their swing vote on the Board of Supervisors . He could block the Milk/Moscone agenda.That was why Milk did n't want Dan White on the board.So , it was political , the murders . Maybe I should have , again in hindsight , possibly Tom , even though his attempts to do that may have been ruled inadmissable , possibly Tom should have been a little stronger in that area.But again , at the time I mean , even the press was shocked at the outcome But  --  Well , I think that what the jury had already boughtwas White 's background  --  Now that 's what was really on trial.Dan White sat there and waved his little American flagand they acquitted him.They convicted George and Harvey.Now if this had been a poor black or a poor Chicanoor a poor white janitor who 'd been fired , or the husband of an alleged girlfriend of Moscone'sI do n't think they would have bought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was a member of acounty Board of Supervisors who left the police department , who had served in the Army , who was a fireman , who played baseball  --  I think that 's what they were caught up in  --  that kind of person must have been crazy to do this. I would have interpreted it differently.Not to be held to a higher standard , but uh that he had all the tools to be responsible . One of the things people said was : " Why did n't you talk more about George 's background , his family life , etc. ? " Well One of the reasons is that Tom Norman did know that , had he opened up that area , they were prepared , yeah  --  they were prepared to smear George  --  bring up the incident in Sacramento.With the woman  --  ( And other things . ) It would be at best a wash , so why get into it ? If you know they 're going to bring out thingsthat are n't positive.We wanted to let the city heal . We  --  And after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the jury had stuck to the facts alone , I mean , the confession alone was enough to convict him I mean , look at this kid that shot Reagan , it was the same thing . All the way through that , they said , my friends  --  " Well , Christ , look at what the prosecutors went through on this one , Joe  --  " It 's tragic that this has to be the kind of experience that will make you feel better . And then about White being antigaywell White inside himself may have been antigay , butthat Milk was his target As I say  --  Malice was there.Milk led the fight to keep White off the board , which makes the murder all the more rational.I know the gay community thinks the murder was antigay:political in that sense . ButI think , they 're wrong . Ya know , some people  --  in the gay community  --  ah  --  even said I threw the trial.Before this , I was considered a great friendto the gay community.Why would I want to throw the trial , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were accusations you would n't believe At the trial , a woman it may have been one of the jurors  --  I ca n't remember Actually said  --  " But what would Mary Ann White do without her husband ? " And I remember my outrage.She never thought , " What will Gina Moscone do without George ? " I must tell you that it 's hard for me to talk about a lotof these things , all of this is just the  --  justthe tip of the iceberg We thought  --  Tommy and I  --  Tom Norman and I  --  We thought it was an open-and-shut caseof first-degree murder . ( Lights. ) p. 60 NORMAN It was n't just an automatic reaction when he fired those last two shots into George Moscone 's brains was it , Doctor ? JUDGE Let 's move on , Mr. Norman . You are just arguing with the witnesses now . NORMAN Your Honor  --  JUDGE Let 's move on . ( Screen : " The Psychiatric Defense . " Lights up . Psychiatrists , conservative dress , in either separate witness stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he was out of control and in an unreasonable stage . And I think if the gun had held , you know , maybe more bullets , maybe he would have shot more bullets . I do n't know . DR . LUNDE This was n't just some mild case of the blues . DR . SOLOMON I think that , you know , maybe Mr. Moscone would have been just as dead with one bullet . I do n't know . DR . JONES I think he was out of control . DELMAN Yes . NORMAN George Moscone was shot four times , Doctor . The gun had five cartridges in it . Does that change your opinion in any way ? DR . SOLOMON No . I think he just kept shooting for awhile . ( Norman throws his notes down. ) p. 61 SCHMIDT Now , there is another legal term we deal with in the courtroom , and that is variously called " malice " or " malice aforethought . " And this must be present in order to convict for murder in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this by saying I am not sure how malice is defined . I 'll give you what my understanding is . In order to have malice , you would have to be able to do certain things : to be able to be intent to kill somebody unlawfully . You would have to be able to do something for a base and antisocial purpose . You would have to be aware of the duty imposed on you not to do that , not to unlawfully kill somebody or do something for a base , antisocial purpose , that involved a risk of death , and you would have to be able to act , despite having that awareness of that , that you are not supposed to do that , and so you would have to know that you are not supposed to do it , and then also act despite  --  keeping in mind that you are not supposed to do it.Is that your answer  --  your question ? SCHMIDT I think so . ( Pause . ) DR . JONES ( Laughs ) I felt that he had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to intend to kill , but that does n't take much , you know , to try to kill somebody , it 's not a highfalutin mental state . I think he had the capacity to do something for a base and antisocial purpose.I think he had the capacity to know that there was a dutyimposed on him not to do that , but I do n't think he had the capacity to hold that notionin his mind while he was acting ; so that I think that the depression , plus the moment , the tremendous emotion of the moment , with the depression , reduced his capacity for conforming conduct . ( Pause ) As ridiculous as this sounds , even to the point of institutingto kill the mayor , what he describes is more simply  --  is striking out , no intending to kill , well , obviously , if you have a gun in your hand , and you are striking out , you know you are going to cause at least great bodily harm , if not death , but as near as I can come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just , you know , striking out . ( Pause ) In fact , I asked him : " Why did n't you hit them ? " And he was flabbergasted that I asked such a thing , because it was contrary to his code of behavior , you know , he was taken aback , kind of  --  hit them seemed ridiculous to him  --  because it would have been so unfair , since he could have defeated them so easilyin a fistfight. p. 62 SCHMIDT Thank you . ( He sits ; to Norman ) You may examine . NORMAN Doctor Jones , when let off at City Hall the accused was let off at the Polk Street entrance and then walked a block and a half to Van Ness Avenue . Why would n't he just enter City Hall through the main entrance ? DR . JONES He got towards the top of the stairs , then looked up , saw the metal detector and thought : " Oh , my goodness , I got that gun . " ( Pause . ) NORMAN Doctor , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that a gun would have been discovered upon his person ? DR . JONES Well , I would presume that would mean some degree of hassle . I mean , I presume that the metal detector would see if somebody is trying to bring a weapon in . NORMAN That is usually why they have it . ( Pause ) Did he realize at that time that he was unlawfully carrying a concealable firearm ? DR . JONES I presume so . NORMAN Dr. Jones , if it 's a fact that Dan White shot George Moscone twice in the body , and that when George Moscone fell to the floor disabled , he shot twice more into the right side of George Moscone 's head at a distance of between twelve and eighteen inches , he made a decision at that time , did n't he , to either discharge the gun into the head of George Moscone , or not discharge the gun into the head of George Moscone ? p. 63 DR . JONES If decision means he behaved in that way , then , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of choice based upon some reasoning process ? DR . JONES Oh , no , not based on reasoning necessarily , I think  --  I do n't think that I  --  you know , great emotional turmoil in context of major mood disorder  --  he was enraged and anxious and frustrated in addition to the underlying depression , I think that after Moscone says " How 's your family ? " or " What 's your wife going to do ? " at that point , I think that it 's  --  it 's over . NORMAN It 's over for George Moscone . DR . SOLOMON I think that if you look at the gun as a transitional object , you can see that transitional objects are clung to in  --  in situations of great  --  of anxiety and insecurity , as one sees with children  --  NORMAN Doctor , are you telling us that a person who has lived an otherwise law-abiding life and an otherwise moral life could not premeditate and deliberate as is contemplated by the definition of first-degree murder ? ! DR . SOLOMON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more difficult for a person who lives a highly moral life . And this individual , Dan White , had , if you want  --  a hypertrophy complex . Hypertrophy meaning overdeveloped . Rigidly . Morally . Overdeveloped  --  But I would say in general , yes.I do n't think you 'd even kill Mr. Schmidt if you lost this case . p. 64 NORMAN It 's unlikely . DR . SOLOMON You may be very angry , but I do n't think you will do it because I think you are probably a very moral and law-abid  --  ing citizen , and I think if you did it , I would certainly recommend a psychiatric examination , because I think there would be a serious possibility that you had flipped . ( Pause ) It 's most interesting to me how split off his feelings were at this time . DR . LUNDE Dan White had classical symptoms that are described in diagnostic manuals for depression and , of course , he had characteristics of compulsive personality , which happens to be kind of a bad combination in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that he took a gun with him when he determined to see George Moscone , a loaded gun ? DR . SOLOMON Yes . NORMAN Why did he take that gun , in your opinion . Dr. Solomon ? DR . SOLOMON I might say that I think there are symbolic aspects to this . JUDGE Let 's move on to another question . NORMAN Well , Your Honor JUDGE Let 's move on . p. 65 NORMAN ( Frustrated ) All right . Dr. Delman , after he went in the building armed with a gun through a window and went up to see George Moscone , at the time he came in to see George Moscone , do you feel that he was angry with George Moscone ? DELMAN Yes . NORMAN When George Moscone told him that he was n't going to appoint him , do you think that that brought about and increased any more anger ? DELMAN Yes . NORMAN All right . Now there was some point in there when he shot George Moscone , is n't that true ? DELMAN Yes . NORMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DELMAN I believe it 's four . NORMAN Well , Doctor , do you put any significance upon the circumstances that he shot George Moscone twice in the head ? DELMAN The question is , " Do I put any significance in it ? " NORMAN Yes . DELMAN I really have no idea why that happened . NORMAN Well , Doctor , do you think he knew that if you shot a man twice in the head that it was likely to surely kill him ? p. 66 DELMAN I 'm sure that he knew that shooting a man in the head would kill him , Mr. Norman . NORMAN Thank you ! ( He sits ) SCHMIDT But , it is your conclusion , Doctor , that Dan White could not premeditate or deliberate , within the meaning we have discussed here , on November 27th , 1978 ? DELMAN That is correct . ( Norman slaps hand to head . Lights . ) DR . BLINDER I teach forensic psychiatry.I teach about the uses and abuses of psychiatry in the judicial system.The courts tend to place psychiatry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sole arbiterbetween guilt and innocence.There is also a tendency in the stresses of the adversary systemto polarize a psychiatric statement so that a psychiatrist finds himself trying to put labels on normal stressful behavior , and everything becomes a mental illness.And I think that is an abuse . ( Refers to his notes ) Dan White found City Hall rife of corruption . With the possible exceptions of Dianne Feinstein and Harvey Milk , the supervisors seemed to make their judgments , their votes , on the basis of what was good for them , rather than what was good for the city.And this was a very frustrating thing for Mr. White:to want to do a good job for his constituents and find hewas continually defeated . In addition to these stresses , there wereattacks by the pressand there were threats of literal attacks on supervisors.He told me a number of supervisors like himselfcarried a gun to scheduled meetings.Never any relief from these tensions . Whenever he felt things were not going right , he would abandon his usual program of exercise and good nutritionand start gorging himself on junk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the TV.Ordinarily , he reads . ( Mr. White has always been an identifiable Jack London adventurer . ) But now , getting very depressed about the fact he would not be reappointed , he just sat there before the TVbinging on Twinkies ( Screen : " The Twinkie Defense . " ) He could n't sleep.He was tossing and turning on the couch in the living room so he would n't disturb his wife on the bed . Virtually no sexual contact at this time.He was dazed , confused , had crying spells , became increasingly ill , and wanted to he left alone . He told his wife : " Do n't bother cooking any food for me.I will just munch on these potato chips . " Mr. White stopped shavingand refused to go out of the houseto help Denise rally support . He started to receive information that he would not be reappointedfrom unlikely sources.This was very stressing to him . Again , it got to be cupcakes , candy bars.He watched the sun come up on Monday morning . Finally , at nine o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and puts on his suit.He sees his gun  --  lying on the table.Ammunition.He simultaneously puts these in his pocket.Denise picks him up.He 's feeling anxious about a variety of things.He 's sitting in the car hyperventilating , blowing on his hands , repeating : " Let him tell me to my face why he wo n't reappoint me.Did he think I ca n't take it ? I am a man.I can take it . " He goes down to City Hall , and I sense that time is shortso let me bridge this by saying that as I believe it has been testified to , he circumvents the mental sic detector , goes to the side window , gets an appointment with the mayor.The mayor almost directly tells him , " I am not going to reappoint you . " The mayor puts his arm around him saying : " Let 's have a drink.What are you going to do now , Dan ? Can you get back into the Fire Department ? What about your family ? Can your wife get her job back ? What 's going to happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Mary Ann White . ) Somehow this inquiry directed to his family struck a nerve.The mayor 's voice started to fade out and Mr. White felt " As if I were in a dream . " He started to leave and then inexplicably turned aroundand like a reflexdrew his revolver.He had no idea how many shots he fired . The similar event occurred in Supervisor Milk 's office . sic He remembers being shocked by the sound of the gungoing off for the second time like a cannon.He tells me that he was aware that he engaged in a lethal act ,  --  but tells me he gave no thought to his wrongfulness.As he put it to me : " I had no chance to even think about it . " He remembers running out of the building , driving , I think , to church , making arrangements to meet his wife , and then going from the churchto the Police Department . ( Pause . Blinder exhausted. ) p. 67 SCHMIDT Doctor , you have mentioned the ingestion of sugar and sweets and that sort of thing . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ingestion thereof , and I 'd like to just touch on that briefly with the jury . Does that have any significance , or could it possibly have any significance ? DR . BLINDER ( Turns to jury ) First , there is a substantial body of evidence that in susceptible individuals , large quantities of what we call junk food , high-sugar-content food with lots of preservatives , can precipitate antisocial and even violent behavior.There have been studies , for example , where they have taken so-called career criminals and taken them off all their junk food and put them on meat and potatoes and their criminal records immediately evaporate . ( Pause ) It 's contradictory and ironic , but the way it works is that for such a person , the American Dream is a Nightmare . For somebody like Dan White . SCHMIDT Thank you , Doctor . ( Lights fade on psychiatrists . Pause . Blazing white lights up on Mary Ann White . She is almost blinded .

" p. 69 SCHMIDT After he was on the board , did you notice these moods/ /become more frequent ? MARY ANN Yes , he had talked to me about how hard the job was on him.You know , from June he started to talk about how it was.Obviously you can sense when you are not sleeping together , and you are not really growing together , and he would say , " Well , I ca n't  --  I ca n't really think of anyone elsewhen I do n't even like myself .

NORMAN Did Mr. Milk and Mr. White take positions that were opposite to each other ? p. 76 SILVER Yes NORMAN Was there anything that became , well , rather loud and perhaps hostile in connection or consisting between the two ? SILVER Not loud but very hostile . You have to first understand that this street closure was recommended by the police chief and had been done customarily in the years past/ /and is , was-came up as an uncontested issue practically . SCHMIDT Your Honor , I again- JUDGE Please , just make your objection . SCHMIDT I 'd like to . JUDGE Without going through contortions . SCHMIDT There is an objection . JUDGE All right . Sustained . NORMAN Miss Silver , did you know , or did you ever see Mr. White to appear to be depressed or to be withdrawn ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Silver flabbergasted , upset . ) JUDGE All right . Any questions , Mr. Schmidt . SCHMIDT Is it Miss Silver ? SILVER Yes . ( Schmidt looks to jury , smiles . Lights up on Moscone 's friend. ) p. 77 SCHMIDT Miss Silver , you never had lunch with Dan White . did you ? SILVER Did I ever have lunch ? MOSCONE 'S FRIEND George was socially brilliant in that he could find the injustice . SCHMIDT I mean the two of you ? SILVER I do n't recall having done so/ /but I- MOSCONE 'S FRIEND His mind went immediately to what can we do ? SCHMIDT Did you socialize frequently. ? MOSCONE 'S FRIEND What can we practically do ? SILVER No , when his son was born/ /I went to a party at his house and that kind of thing . SCHMIDT Did Mr. Norman contact you last week , or did you contact him ? MOSCONE 'S FRIEND Rather like the image of Robert Kennedy in Mississippi in 1964 . SILVER On Friday morning I called his office to- MOSCONE 'S FRIEND Y'know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SILVER because I was reading the newspaper- SCHMIDT Yes . MOSCONE 'S FRIEND but when he saw it/ /he said , p. 78 SILVER And it appeared to me that- JUDGE Do n't tell us ! MOSCONE 'S FRIEND " This is intolerable . " SILVER I am sorry . MOSCONE 'S FRIEND And then he did something about it . ( Beat . ) JUDGE The jurors are told not to read the newspaper , and I am hoping that they haven't/ /read the newspapers . SILVER I apologize . JUDGE Okay . SCHMIDT Miss Silver- JUDGE I am sorry , I did n't want to cut her off- SILVER No , I understand . JUDGE from any other answer . SCHMIDT I think she did complete the answer . Judge . In any event , you contacted Mr. Norman , did you not ? SILVER Yes , I did . SCHMIDT And at that time , you offered to Mr. Norman to round up people who could say that Dan White never looked depressed at City Hall , is that fair ? SILVER That 's right . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were other people /who could similarly testify to that fact . p. 79 SCHMIDT In fact , you expressed it though you have n't sat here and listened to the testimony in this courtroom ? SILVER No , I have never been here before Friday when I was subpoenaed / /and spent some time in the jury room . SCHMIDT But to use your words , after having read what was in the paper , you said that the defense sounded like ( As if he were spitting on his mother 's grave ) " bullshit " to you ? SILVER That 's correct . ( Subliminal music . ) DENMAN I thought I would be a chief witness for the prosecution . SCHMIDT Would that suggest then that perhaps you have a bias in this case ? DENMAN What was left unsaid was what the trial should have been about . SILVER I certainly have a bias . SCHMIDT You are a political enemy of Dan White 's , is that fair ? SILVER No , that 's not true . DENMAN Before , y'know , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements of the/ /Police Officers Association . SCHMIDT Did you have any training in psychology or psychiatry ? p. 80 DENMAN And those were the cops Dan White was closest to . SILVER No more than some of the kind of C.E.B . courses lawyer 's psychology for lawyers/ /kind of training . DENMAN I think he knew a lot of guys would think he did the right thing and yeah they would make him a hero . SCHMIDT I mean , would you be able to diagnose , say , manic depression depressed type , or could you distinguish that from unipolar depression ? SILVER No . ( Pause . ) DENMAN I was Dan White 's jailer for seventy-two hours after the assassinations . SCHMIDT Did you ever talk to him about his dietary habits or anything like that ? DENMAN There were no tears . SILVER I remember a conversation about nutrition or something like that , but I ca n't remember/ /the substance of it . SCHMIDT I do n't have anything further . DENMAN There was no shame . JUDGE Any redirect , Mr. Norman ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew exactly what he was doing and there was no remorse . ( Pause. ) p. 81 NORMAN Miss Silver , you were asked if you had a bias in this case . You knew Harvey Milk very well and you liked him , did n't you ? SILVER I did ; and also George Moscone . NORMAN Miss Silver , speaking of a bias , had you ever heard the defendant say anything about getting people of whom Harvey Milk numbered himself ? ( Lights up on Milk 's friend . ) SILVER In the Polk Street debate- MILK 'S FRIEND The night Harvey was elected , I went to bed earlybecause it was more happiness than I had been taughtto deal with . SILVER Dan White got up and gavea long diatribe  --  MILK 'S FRIEND Next morning we put up signs saying " Thank You . " SILVER Just a-a very unexpected and very uncharacteristic of Dan , long hostile speech about how gays and their lifestyleshad to be contained and we can't//encourage this kind of thing and  --  SCHMIDT I am going to object to this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MILK 'S FRIEND During that , Harvey came over and told methat he had made a political willbecause he expected he 'd be killed.And then in the same breath , he said ( I 'll never forget it ) : " It works , it works " NORMAN All right that 's all . MILK 'S FRIEND The system works/ / NORMAN Thank you . ( Pause . ) DENMAN When White was being booked , it all seemed fraternal . One officer gave Dan a pat on the behind when he was booked , sort of a " Hey , catch you later , Dan " pat . JUDGE Any recross ? DENMAN Some of the officers and deputies were standing around with half-smirks on their faces . Some were actually laughing . SCHMIDT Just a couple . DENMAN The joke they kept telling was , " Dan White 's mother says to him when he comes home , No , dummy , I said milk and baloney , not Moscone ! " ( Pause . ) SCHMIDT Miss Silver , you are a part of the gay community also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . SILVER You mean , am I gay ? SCHMIDT Yes . SILVER No , I 'm not . SCHMIDT I have nothing further . MOSCONE 'S FRIEND George would have said , " This is intolerable , " and he 'd have done something about it . JUDGE All right You may leave as soon as the bailiff takes the microphone off . ( Silver sits for a while , shaken . ) JUDGE Next witness , please . DENMAN I do n't know All I can say is , if Dan White was as depressedas the defense psychiatrists said he was before he went to City Hall , then shooting these people sure seemed to clear up his mind ( Silver exits towards door . Lu with TV light . ) JOANNA LU ( On camera ) : Miss Silver , Supervisor Silver , would you like to elaborate on Mr. White 's antigay feelings or hostility to Harvey Milk or George Moscone ?

JUDGE The People rest ? NORMAN Yes . JUDGE Does the Defense have any witnesses ? SCHMIDT ( Surprised ) : Well , we can discuss it . Your Honor . I am not sure there is anything to rebut . ( Lights . Commotion in court . Screen : " The People Rest . " Lights up on Schmidt at a lectern , a parish priest at a pulpit . Screen : " Summations . " ) ( In a sweat , going for the home stretch ) I 'm nervous . I 'm very nervous.I sure hope I say all the right things . I ca n't marshal words the way Mr. Norman can  --  But-I believe strongly in things . Lord God ! I do n't say to you to forgive Dan White.I do n't say to you to justlet Dan White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of responsibility is the issue here . The state of mind is the issue here.It 's not who was killed ; it 's why.It 's not who killed them ; but why.The state of mind is the issue here . Lord God ! The pressures.Nobody can say that the things that happened to himdays or weeks precedingwould n't make a reasonable and ordinary manat least mad , angry in some way . Surely  --  surely , that had to have arisen , not to kill , not to kill , just to be mad , to act irrationally , because if you kill , when you are angry , or under the heat of passion , if you kill , then the law will punish you , and you will be punished by God  --  God will punish you , but the law will also punish you . Heat of passion fogs judgment , makes one act irrationally , in the very least , and my God , that is what happened at the very least . Forget about the mental illness , forget about all the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrationally , impulsively-out of some passion . Now you will recall at the close of the prosecution 's case , it was suggested to you this was a calm , cool , deliberating , terrible terrible personthat had committed two crimes like these , and these are terrible crimes , and that he was emotionally stable at that timeand there was n't anything wrong with him . He did n't have any diminished capacity.Then we played these tapes he made directly afterhe turned himself in at Northern Station . My God , that was not a person that was calm and collected and cooland able to weigh things out. It just was n't . The tape just totally fogged me up the first time I heard it. It was a man that was , as Frank Falzon said , broken.Shattered.This was not the Dan White that everybody had known . Something happened to him and he snapped.That 's the word I used in my opening statement.Something snapped here . The pot had boiled over here , and people that boil over in that fashion , they tell the truth . Have the tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said.He said in no uncertain terms , " My God , why did I do these things ? What made me do this ? How on earth could I have done this ? I did n't intend to do this. I did n't intend to hurt anybody.My God , what happened to me ? Why ? " Play the tape.If everybody says that tape is truthful , play the tape.I 'd agree it 's truthful . With regard to the reloading and some of these littlediscrepancies that appeared to come up. I am not even sure of the discrepancies , but if there werediscrepancies , listen to it in context . ( Picks up transcript , reads ) " Where did you reload ? " " I reloaded in my office , I think . " " And then did you leave the mayor 's office ? " " Yes , then I left the mayor 's office . " That does n't mean anything to me at all.It does n't mean anything to me at all.And I do n't care where the reloading took place ! But listen to the tape.It says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hurt anybody.I did n't intend to do this.Why do we do things ? " I do n't know . It was a man desperately trying to grab at something " What happened to me ? How could I have done this ? " If the District Attorney concedesthat what is on that tape is truthful , and I believe that 's the insinuation we have here , then , by golly , there is voluntary manslaughter , nothing more and nothing less . Now , I do n't know what more I can say.He 's got to be punishedand he will be punished.He 's going to have to live with this for the rest of his life.His child will live with itand his family will live with it , and God will punish him , and the law will punish him , and they will punish him severely . But please , please.Just justice.That 's all.Just justice here . ( He appears to break for a moment ) Now I am going to sit down and very soon , and that 's it for me . And this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think Mr. Norman is going to do it , but you can make up a picture of a dead man , or two of them for that matter , and you can wave them around and saysomebody is going to pay for thisand somebody is going to pay for this . Dan White is going to pay for this.But it 's not an emotional type thing. I get emotional about it , butyou ca n't because you have to be objective about the facts I get one argument.I have made it.And if I could get up and argue again.God , we 'd go on all night . I just hope that  --  I just hope that you 'll come to the same conclusionthat I have come to.And thank you for listening to me . ( Schmidt holds the lectern , then sits. ) p. 85 NORMAN Ladies and gentlemen of the jury , having the burden of proof , I am given an opportunity a second time to address you . I listened very carefully to the summation just given you.It appears to me , members of the jury , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberation.The evidence that has been laid before youscreams for murder in the first degree . What counsel for the defense has done is suggest to you to excuse this kind of conduct and call it something that it is n't , to call it voluntary manslaughter . Members of the jury , you are the triers of fact here.You have been asked to hear this tape recording again.The tape recording has been aptly described as something very moving . We all feel a sense of sympathy , a sense of empathy for our fellow man , but you are not to letsympathy influence you in your judgment . To reduce the charge of murder to something less  --  to reduce it to voluntary manslaughter  --  means you are saying that this was not murder.That this was an intentional killing of a human beingupon a quarrel , or heat of passion.But ladies and gentlemen , that quarrel must have been so extremeat the timethat the defendant could not  --  was incapable of formingthose qualities of thought which aremalice , premeditation and deliberation.But the evidence in this case does n't suggest that at all.Not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something that happened to be in the mayor 's officeand hit the mayor over the head and killed himyou know , you know that argument for voluntary manslaughtermight be one which you could say the evidence admitsa reasonable doubt . But  --  Ladies and gentlemen:The facts are:It was he  --  Dan White  --  who brought the gun to City Hall.The gun was not there.It was he who brought the extra cartridges for the gun ; they were not found there . He went to City Hall and when he got therehe went to the Polk Street door . There was a metal detector there.He knew he was carrying a gun.He knew that he had extra cartridges for it . Instead of going through the metal detector , he decided to go around the corner.He was capable at that time of expressing anger.He was capable of , according to the doctor  --  well , parenthetically , members of the jury , I do n't know how they can look in your head and tell youwhat you are able to do . But  --  They even said that he was capable of knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you fired that gunthat you would surely kill a person . He went around the corner , and climbed through a window into City Hall . He went up to the mayor 's office.He appeared , according to witnesses , to act calmly in his approach , in his speech . He chatted with Cyr Copertini ; he was capable of carrying on a conversation to the extent that he was able to ask her how she was , after having asked to see the mayor . ( Looks to audience ) He stepped into the mayor 's office.After some conversation , he shot the mayor twice in the body.Then he shot the mayor in the head twicewhile the mayor was disabled on the floor.The evidence suggests that in order to shoot the mayortwice in the headhe had to lean down to do it . ( He demonstrates , looks to jury ) Deliberation is premeditation.It has malice.I feel stultified to even bring this up.This is the definition of murder . He reloaded the gun.Wherever he reloaded the gun , it was he who reloaded it ! He did see Supervisor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was capable of expressing anger in that regard . He entered the supervisors ' area ( a block from the mayor 's office across City Hall ) and was told , " Dianne wants to see you . " He said , " That is going to have to wait a moment , I have something to do first . " Then he walked to Harvey Milk 's office , put his head in the door and said , " Can I see you a moment , Harv ? " The reply was , " Yes . " He went across the hall and put three bulletsinto Harvey Milk 's body , one of which hit Harvey directly in the back.When he fell to the floor disabled.two more were delivered to the back of his head . Now what do you call that but premeditation and deliberation ? What do you call that realisticallybut a cold-blooded killing ? Two cold-blooded executions.It occurs to me that if you do n't call them that , then you are ignoring the objective evidenceand the objective facts here . Members of the jury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe even rage , I do n't know.but the manner in which that anger was feltand was handledis socially something that can not be approved . Ladies and gentlemen , the quality of your service is reflected in your verdict . ( Norman sits . Joanna Lu , at door , stops Schmidt . TV lights. ) p. 86 JOANNA LU ( On camera ) Mr. Schmidt , do you  --  SCHMIDT Yes . JOANNA LU ( On camera ) Do you feel society would feel justice is served if the jury returns two manslaughter verdicts ? SCHMIDT ( Wry smile ) Society does n't have anything to do with it . Only those twelve people in the jury box . JUDGE Ladies and gentlemen of the jury , Now that you have heard the evidence , we come to that part of the trial where you are instructedon the applicable law . In the crime of murder of the first degreethe necessary concurrent mental states are:Malice aforethought , premeditation and deliberation . In the crime of murder of the second degree , the necessary concurrent mental state is:Malice aforethought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state is:An intent to kill . Involuntary manslaughter is an unlawful killing without malice aforethoughtand without intent to kill . The law does not undertake to limit or define the kinds of passionwhich may cause a person to act rashly.Such passions as desperation , humiliation , resentment , anger , fear , or rage.or any other high-wrought emotion can be sufficient to reduce the killings to manslaughterso long as they are sufficient to obscure the reasonand render the average man likely to act rashly.There is no malice aforethoughtif the killing occurred upon a sudden quarrelor heat of passion . There is no malice aforethoughtif the evidence shows that due to diminished capacitycaused by illness , mental defect , or intoxication , the defendant did not have the capacityto form the mental state constituting malice aforethought , even though the killing was intentional , voluntary , premeditated and unprovoked .
