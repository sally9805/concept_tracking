This Italianate stone villa looks newer than the 18th-century-style mini-palaces around it , but actually it ' s a bit older . It was built in the 1850s , before the really aggressive architectural competition began among the society hostesses here . So the interior is warmer in feeling than those of the other mansions ; it is Grandmother ' s house - on a vastly more generous scale , of course. // // The small rooms - by Newport standards - the jolly golden-oak Eastlake furniture and woodwork , the stained glass windows , the fanciful stenciled ceilings , the playful trellis pattern that runs up the open stairwell , make this a place for children. // It ' s a wonderful Christmas house . You can picture the four little Wetmores , children of the original owner , William Shephard Wetmore ( governor of Rhode Island ) , running up and down the laurel-roped divided stairway . I feel sure they would have appreciated the fireplaces banked with holiday plants and the carved wooden mantels invisible under fir and holly , grapes and cones. // And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung with fans and angels , bouquets of dried flowers , Japanese lanterns , lavender ribbons , candles , and hearts stuffed with potpourri. // Chateau-sur-Mer was one of the few Newport mansions that was lived in year-round . Most of these flamboyant ' ' summer cottages ' ' were shut for the winter . When Mrs. Stuyvesant Fish and her group came for the season , what with servants and friends and bags and baggage , it was like a small army on the move - not a journey to be undertaken more than once a year. // Thus , the Christmas decorations in Rosecliff are a fantasy of what Christmas might have been , had owner Theresa Fair Oelrichs and her guests spent the holiday at Rosecliff. // Mrs. Oelrichs ' s father was one of the discoverers of the Comstock Lode , the richest silver mine ever found in Colorado , and she once gave a famous party in her cream-colored ballroom - to which all the ladies wore white dresses. // So Rosecliff , based on Versailles ' s Grand Trianon , traditionally decks the halls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous heart-shaped staircase . More white blooms collect between the arched French windows of the ballroom , which look out on one side to green lawn and great stone urns and on the other to a stormy gray winter sea . White scallop shells , white lights , tinsel , and balls of sterling silver shine on the 18-foot tree in the peach damask salon. // I like to think that Newport ' s extravagant mansions take on - if such a thing is possible - almost a homey atmosphere at Christmas . Come to Rosecliff in the summer , and you keep visualizing F. Scott Fitzgerald lounging by the fountain ( the ' ' Great Gatsby ' ' was filmed here , and echoes linger ) . But a house , any house , with a Christmas tree seems a place for family and friends. // The Elms , built by coal magnate Edward Berwind , is a copy of the Chateau d ' Asnieres , near Paris . Mr. Berwind could afford it ; it was said that there wasn ' t a ship on any ocean that didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are intended to represent an Edwardian Christmas , in red and gold , I was told , though the color of the poinsettias this season is really pink . But they are everywhere - in front of statues , on the gold piano in the white salon , in the imperial-sized Chinese cachepots , framing the grand marble stairs where you enter . The Berwinds died childless - and fortunately the house was saved from destruction by the Newport Preservation Society , which now owns and maintains all the mansions. // Nearby Marble House , home of the formidable Alva Vanderbilt , had a child living in it - the hapless Consuelo , who was once confined to her room upstairs , with its splendid but heavy English baronial furniture , so she couldn ' t escape before her wedding to the Duke of Marlborough. // Consuelo later defied her mother ' s social ambitions , divorced the Duke , and married a man she loved . But it ' s too bad it didn ' t happen here : Marble House ' s gold ballroom is just the place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers the walls , and gold faces peer down at you from above ; there are two mighty gilded chandeliers , with trumpeting cherubs and forests of candles , and a mantel of fleur-de-peche marble surmounted by two bronze statues. // In December the mantel is shrouded in a welter of holiday red and greenery . But the piece de resistance of the tour is the 18-foot Christmas ' ' tree ' ' of red poinsettias , 500 pots ' worth , looking like a gigantic red bell. // There ' s no marble on the outside of Marble House - it ' s modeled after the Petit Trianon in Versailles ; the two-story entrance hall of golden marble gives it its name . The dining room is marble , too - a light oxblood color . The centerpiece of the long table is a three-foot-high silver epergne of sheep and human figures surrounded by holly and red carnations. // If you drive along Newport ' s Bellevue Avenue , you can see these reminders of Versailles on either side of the road . There ' s the airy grace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to pick out the scallop shells and laurel adorning the gargoyles by the front door . And Chateau-sur-Mer , hiding its seasonal decoration within. // But you can pick out a few wreaths - classic green , with plain red bows - on the magnificent banklike fronts of Marble House and the Elms . And , in honor of the holiday season , these noble facades look friendly , almost welcoming. // // All four houses are lit from dusk to 11 . They are open only on weekends in the winter , from 10 a. m. to 4 p. m. // Receptions are being at one of the four houses on successive Sundays this month . The reception next Sunday , the last one , is at Marble House . Cookies , eggnog , and music are included. // // // // //
