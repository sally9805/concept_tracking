It ' s a dark and stormy night  --  and then all hell breaks loose . Lord Edgar Hillcrest has just brought his new bride , Lady Enid , to Mandacrest , the drafty family manse on the moors . The new mistress isn ' t especially welcome . The Judith Anderson of a maid keeps giving her dirty looks , while the one-legged butler , Nicodemus , winces very oddly every time a full moon is mentioned . And that looming portrait of milady ' s predecessor , the late Lady Hillcrest , wouldn ' t be all that bothersome  --  if it would only stop bleeding . If " Rebecca " comes to mind , it should , plus " Jane Eyre , " " Gaslight , " " Nosferatu , " " The Mummy , " and bits of Shakespeare , Edgar Allen Poe and " The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam " thrown in for good measure . " The Mystery of Irma Vep , " a Remains Theatre production opening Feb. 22 at the Organic Theater , is billed as a packed compendium of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real-life nightmare  --  for the actors . Two hapless male performers ( Jamie Baron and Bruce Norris , in this case ) take on all the roles , including the female ones . ( The number of characters is said to be somewhere between six and eight , the actual total kept secret out of deference to the play ' s convoluted plot . ) The number itself isn ' t as intimidating as the structure . The show celebrates the live art of the quick change in such a way as to put the two actors through a marathon of breathless costume switches . " It is , " says Charles Ludlam , who wrote the play for his Ridiculous Theatrical Company and performed in it more than 300 times off-Broadway , " about the most difficult thing you could ever do . " How hard is it ? Picture this : Baron is onstage as Lady Enid , he hears a noise and rushes out , he returns as Nicodemus and utters one line , leaves and comes back as Lady Enid , says another line , leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then leaves and comes back on , all building to a point in which the left half of his body is on stage as Enid while his right arm ( as Nicodemus ) comes through French windows to pat Enid ' s cheek . ( Baron , meanwhile , is throwing his voice offstage to be Nicodemus . ) All together , the show features 42 costume changes in only 80 minutes of stage time ; the shortest occurs in three seconds . How will they pull it off ? There ' s the costumes and wigs , with all kinds of built-in tricks to facilitate the speedy ins and outs , " miles and miles of Velcro , " someone with the show remarked . There are also three backstage dressers . As another aid , the Remains troupe has been busy building a special fourth-wall proscenium stage inside the usually cavernous , wide open Organic space . That ' s to accommodate trap doors , sliding panels and bleeding portraits , as well as to facilitate costume changes and one quick side trip to Egypt to flesh out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the performers . In Baron and Norris , director Larry Sloan has hit on a promising combination , even though he reached outside the Remains ensemble to find them . Baron , as a founding member of the Practical Theatre Company , is used to revue work , changing characters with every skit . He ' s also no stranger to drag  --  his repertoire to date includes Mrs. Fezziwig ( in the Goodman Theatre ' s " A Christmas Carol " ) , Jill in the " Jack and Jill " nursery rhyme , Vanna White and , arguably , the best Ethel Merman in Chicago . " I ' m basing my characterizations for this show on Peter Lorre , Bela Lugosi , Bette Davis , Joan Fontaine , Charles Laughton and Frank Galati , " he said . Norris has played the moody , taut-nerved young man in " Master Harold . . . And the Boys " and a mincing , flamboyant aristocrat in Remains ' " Puntila and His Hired Man . " He also played the all-American , very Jewish Eugene Morris Jerome as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Biloxi Blues . " If nothing else , all the effort going into " Irma " should be worth one musical moment , a rare non-hectic point in the show in which Norris and Baron , as Jane Twisden and Lady Enid , sit quietly and play a sweet little duet on twin dulcimers . It all sounds like campy , quicksilver , madcap fun , but there ' s a quite serious side to " Irma , " a reflection of what creator Ludlam calls his " ongoing exploration of the purely theatrical . " Ludlam and his Ridiculous troupe have become , over the years , among the most venerated members of the New York theatrical scene . Camp and drag are but a small part of it . Ludlam and his cohorts , who perform in a tiny Sheridan Square playhouse with a long history ( for a time home to the city ' s first integrated jazz club ) , are dedicated to preserving " lost " theatrical traditions , from the quick change to Punch ' n ' Judy antics . " There ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s sometimes in danger of getting lost , " Ludlam says . " Female impersonation , male impersonation , magic in general or just being able to speak in a whisper that ' s heard in a 1 , 500-seat house  --  these are part of a concentration of acting different from the technical realism required by film or television . " " Irma " actually revives two theatrical traditions : the quick change and the penny dreadful , a burlesque , low-budget form of Victorian theater that mocked more serious works , frequently those by Charles Dickens and other celebrated novelists of the day . Ludlam and company have toured extensively , but lately Ludlam has been busy enough to forestall any traveling . That ' s why he has released some of the Ridiculous ' hits , including " Irma , " which is also being mounted in Houston , Albany and even Portugal . Various producers offered Ludlam a Broadway transfer , but he avoided it , arguing " Irma " thrives on an intimate environment . He sees no need to play a bigger commercial space just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that closes on Broadway in a week the establishment and are we the fringe ? I ' m not sure . But I don ' t think we ' re any more on the fringe than tap dancers who play in ' 42nd Street ' for a week . " We ' ve been here for 20 years . " CAPTION : PHOTO : Tribune photo by Ovie Carter .
