The jokes were unavoidable . Why were the Catholic Girls slow to go on stage ? " They must have attended a late mass , " chortled a patron . " Or maybe they wanted to wait until past midnight because it would be Monday morning and not the Sabbath . " All week , similar humor had been heard . Even the owner of Jack ' s , Ben Eisenstadt , couldn ' t help chuckling when he put up posters announcing the Catholic Girls ' gig around town . " What if a priest came by while I was putting them up ? Or an Irish cop ? But then I felt comfortable because I thought , Hey , this is a legitimate act . It ' s all right ' . " Their name may hint at irreverence , but the Catholic Girls are basically a clean , exuberant foursome who poke mild fun at their religious upbringing but are hardly vicious about it . About as defiant as they get is the song " Private School , " an autobiographic al account of singer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Staten Island . The playful lyrics say it all : " Oh Sister , can you tell me , where did I go wrong / Why make me stand in the back of the class in this uniform / I never thought about those boys like you said / I don ' t wan na go to hell . I don ' t even want to be dead . Oh no ! " Rather than vent bitterness or indulge in satire , the Catholic Girls project a joyous pop approach with obvious parallels to the Go- Go ' s . Theydress in Catholic school uniforms , but most of their songs are light-hearted looks at the battle between the sexes , not the battle for one ' s soul . Their album , " Catholic Girls " ( MCA Records ) was one of the brighter debuts of last year , and their show at Jack ' s was equally good-natured and invigorating . Taking the stage late ( it turned out they were at a local engagement party for the sister of bassist Joanne Holland ) , the Girls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious reference . " Welcome to St. John ' s , " he said . But from then on , they were on their own , providing an exhilarating journey through pure , ecumenical pop ( sorry , I couldn ' t resist ) and punchy , snare-drum-pounding dance music . It integrated surf rock , girlish lead vocals ( with a Lene Lovich warble or two from Petersen ) , lively guitar breaks from Janice Viscel , samba beats and humorous lines about foiled love affairs ( " When I got over you I felt so right and good / But you came crawling back just like I said you would " ) . All of this was enhanced by decent showmanship , with Petersen falling to her knees during histrionic passages and bassist Holland hopping around like a kangaroo . It wasn ' t great art , but it was easily assimilated fun . Now based in New Jersey , the band is at least as talented as the Go-Go ' s ( they ' ve been together for three years , so they ' re not Go-Go ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Go-Go ' s Belinda Carlisle . But who knows - with the right breaks they might someday become as popular . Opening was the ever-improving Boston band New Career , which warmed up slowly but came to life with a spate of sturdy originals and a devastating cover of David Bowie ' s " Stay , " in which guitarist Carmen Cocchiaro set a roaring pace . The band still needs to communicate more on stage , and singer Audrey Clark ( a polite Chrissie Hynde ) needs to cut loose some more , but the potential is there for great strides in the future .
