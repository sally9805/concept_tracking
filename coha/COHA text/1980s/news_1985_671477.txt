The agreement was reached as increasing numbers of upstate physicians , particularly specialists in neurosurgery , obstetrics and orthopedic surgery , are withdrawing their services or shifting to less risky forms of practice . The doctors are protesting high malpractice rates and limits on coverage. // In the last week , many lawmakers have said they feel that the doctors withholding services are blackmailing the Legislature into action that would benefit physicians . The lawmakers say the changes would be at the expense of the victims of malpractice , lawyers and the public in general. // Although all the details of the agreement had not been spelled out by late today , it was clear that last year ' s increase in the premium of more than 50 percent would be reduced . It was also understood that a 40 percent rise to take effect next month would not , at least temporarily , be instituted . <> <> Recovery of Higher Costs // Lawyers handling malpractice cases would receive smaller shares of awards than now , and victims of malpractice could expect to have large awards paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be required to pay whatever premiums were needed to insure coverage of liabilities between $1 million and $2 million . Nearly all New York doctors are covered by insurance policies that provide up to $1 million in coverage . The new accord would require hospitals to pay the increased premiums through higher reimbursement rates from Medicaid and Medicare , and from private insurers. // " We have the parameters of a bill we can go forward with in the next 24 hours , " Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink of Brooklyn said in the hall outside the Governor ' s office . He was with the State Senate majority leader , Warren M. Anderson of Binghamton. // The legislation contains the elements of proposals put forth this year by the Assembly , the Senate and the Governor . <> <> Rescheduling of Awards // Mr. Cuomo ' s spokesman , Martin J. Steadman , declined to release any details of the agreement or make members of the Governor ' s staff available to discuss the proposal . But lawmakers and their aides described it as containing these provisions : // * The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be reduced , from the current one-third of any award to a sliding scale . For example , for an award of $1 million , a lawyer now receives $333 , 333 . Under the plan , it would be reduced to $237 , 500. // * Large awards would be paid out over as long as a decade . The length of the period would be determined by the juries in malpractice trials .

The precise amount of the premium reductions would depend on a doctor ' s specialty and his location . For a neurosurgeon in Nassau County , the annual malpractice premium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 114 . For an orthopedic surgeon in Syracuse , a $37 , 641 premium would be dropped , to $31 , 995. // * Hospitals would be required to establish programs to screen every physician ' s credentials , to collect information on cases with adverse outcomes and to resolve patients ' grievances. // In addition , any plaintiff or plaintiff ' s lawyer who files a frivolous malpractice suit , or any defendant or defendant ' s lawyer who presents a frivolous defense to a suit , would be liable to a $10 , 000 penalty. // An actuarial study would be completed by next fall to determine whether the proposal was working to contain rates . The study would also explore a proposal by Mr. Fink to restructure the way insurance companies calculate their assets and liabilities , so that premiums could be reduced. // " We have the elements of an agreement , " said Mr. Cuomo , who spoke to reporters in the former Court of Appeals room in the Capitol . He spoke after signing into law a measure raising the legal age for drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor also announced that an agreement on malpractice legislation had been reached , the Republican Senate majority never indicated concurrence. // Since then , many doctors and their spouses have lobbied lawmakers . They contended that insurance policies limit coverage for awards to $1 million . The cap , the doctors have been arguing , is inadequate , because there have been awards , albeit only a handful , that have been for as much as $2 million and $3 million. // The concern has dominated discussions on the issue . Under the terms of the new proposal , hospitals would pay the additional premiums necessary to provide doctors with liability coverage of between $1 million and $2 million. // The reaction to the accord was mixed and incomplete . The president-elect of the Medical Society of the State of New York , Dr. Daniel F. O ' Keeffe , said he could not comment on the plan until he had seen a printed version of the legislation. // Similarly , Shirley H. Connell , a spokesman for the state ' s largest malpractice-insurance concern , the Medical Liability Mutual Insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan until its legislative language had been outlined. // State Senator Tarky J. Lombardi Jr . , Republican of Syracuse and head of the Health Committee , said that the proposal " doesn ' t properly solve the problem . " He has proposed that awards for pain and suffering in malpractice cases be limited to $250 , 000. // " The best thing we can do to solve this , " Mr. Lombardi said , " is a cap on pain and suffering . The cap is not part of it. " //
