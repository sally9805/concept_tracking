From " Teaching Poetry , " by Hugh Kenner . This essay appears in the collection Teaching Literature : What Is Needed Now , edited by James Engell and David Perkins , published by Harvard University Press . Kenner , who teaches poetry at Johns Hopkins University , is the author most recently of A Sinking Island : The Modern English Writers . By chance , a student mentioned her father 's long-ago habit of reciting . Exposed to his declamations , she 'd known by heart portions of The Ancient Mariner before she could read . I do n't need to tell you that she 's a superior student ; and why do I not need to tell you that ? Because , as I think you 've readily intuited , there are things for which she was not dependent on a teacher : things teachers may or may never think to impart . She 'd needed no persuading , notably , about poetry 's ancient mnemonic function . Enabled by rhythm , word clusters stick to the mind ; hence Homer 's Catalogue of Ships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how written language can engage the larynx , the mouth , the lungs , the torso , arms , hands ? all that we feebly intend when we speak of " sound , " a power to possess the body , alarming alike to Plato and to chartered accountants . ( Possession is unacademic ; it 's like witchcraft . ) Students , not to mention colleagues , tend to he mystified by Robert Frost 's claim that the sound of poetry is like what you hear of a conversation in the next room : a vocal tune lacking words , to which , optionally , " sense " may be fitted . Yeats 's " I am of Ireland , And the Holy Land of Ireland , And time runs on , " cried she . " Come out of charity , Come dance with me in Ireland . " makes , as the late Basil Bunting liked to point out , very little in the way of paraphrasable sense . Pound , composing , intoned inarticulate sounds ; Wordsworth shouted nascent passages aloud to help himself shape them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam Johnson made his verses pacing up and down . So physical an art ; and D. H. Lawrence came at it from the right direction when he got his Croydon pupils all chanting in unison , " The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold , " though from neighboring classrooms there were complaints about the din . nd here we are , facing a roomful of post-adolescents , seated before books all open to be looked at . They are lookers . They " scan " headlines , glance at T-shirts . Their eye culture is silent , abstract . Those who spell securely are bothered by funny spelling : " Susie old foole , unruly Sunne . " Compassionate anthology editors " modernize . " That 's one stumbling block removed . Look into one of them , for instance the Norton , and watch it wrestle with Arnold 's line about the Sea of Faith , that once Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled This difficult line means , in general , that at high tide the sea envelopes the land closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use Wordsworth 's term for it ) like the " folds " of bright clothing ( " girdle " ) which have been compressed ( " furled " ) . Lord , Lord , yes , mercy , we do need air , air . That is not the way to teach poetry , enforcing as it does whatever suspicion that poets just ca n't talk straight . More pertinent to adduce the shortage of rhymes with which English con26 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE/MARCH 1989 fronts a poet when he wants to close his cadence with that satisfying mouthful , " world . " Generally , I read the lines out myself , with a force propelled by a heritage of Welsh preachers . Whatever I 'm teaching , Donne 's " The Sunne Rising " or Pound 's Cantos or Joyce 's Ulysses , I do much reading aloud . Whether it is exemplary reading or not , Laurence Olivier might well dispute ; but it does have two advantages . It slows down the pace at which the students encounter the words . And it nudges them , continually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parody me in the dorms . If so , they 're beginning to vocalize . Time enough , when they 've gained some physical possession of the poem , to investigate effects of tone and diction . The great thing to get used to is poetry 's slow way of letting meaning emerge . We 'll not compress into an hour what can take centuries ; much has still to emerge from Shakespeare . Though in an hour the process can sometimes be glimpsed . Here 's a seeming opacity : Sound slender , quasi tinnula , Ligur ' wide : Si no'us vei , Domna don plus mi cal , Negus vezer mon bel pensar no val . " Between the two almond trees flowering , The viel held close to his side ; And another : s'adora " . " Possum ego naturae non meminisse tuae ! " Qui son Properzio ed Ovidio . The opening of " Canto XX " disentangles itself but slowly from the sounding voice . " Sound slender " and when you sound it takes up at least as much time as " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question " and serves , what is more , to upset most received notions of scansion . Then " quasi tinnula " ? quick , and like ( so its words say ) a little bell . Move on , to the intricacies of Provencal flowing into English , and affirm that by the time they 've experienced that on their tongues they 've moved closer than deconstruction will ever bring them to Eliot on poetry experienced before it is understood . Understanding , an available boon ; yes , it does come ; but after . For observe that , with thirty-one of its forty-eight words drawn from alien lexicons , that wonderful vignette will reach monolingual ears as the pure interwoven senseless sound out of which , I 'm asserting , much poetry gets drawn . If you 'll not reject it out of incomprehension you can start tracing its weave . Meanings , as they get supplied , will fit in . As you gather sense , you gather the way a poet puts sense in , careful never to damage the tune . The strong poem survives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " everything you read ; and you 'll never understand it wholly . That 's one permanent lesson . In our century we have the advantage of the poets ' very voices , preserved . You can hear ( intwo versions ) Yeats chanting " Innisfree , " the way he annoyed a Boston lady so much she demanded to know why he read in that extraordinary fashion . On being told that he read as all true poets since Homer had read , she demanded to know how he knew that Homer had read in that extraordinary fashion . He replied that the ability of the man justified the presumption . Or you can hear Parson Eliot 's peculiar dead intonation of " tubers , " or Stevens reading " An Ordinary Evening in New Haven , " carefully , like the fine print on a surety bond , or Basil Bunting doing Briggflatts in the authentic Northumbrian . Hearing such things can be a beginning of wisdom , for students uncowed by the acoustic presence . One thing the poet does know about his verse is how it sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From time to time Basil did Briggfiatts in public , all the way from the unchallengeable opening line , Brag , sweet tenor bull through the intricate middle , for instance , As the player 's breath warms the fipple the tone clears . It is time to consider how Domenico Scarlatti condensed so much music into so few bars with never a crabbed turn or congested cadence , never a boast or a see-here ; and stars and lakes echo him and the copse drums out his measure , snow peaks are lifted up in moonlight and twilight and the sun rises on an acknowledged land all the way to the muted end : Those were ceremonious occasions , for which he wanted the full Persian ritual . In Persia the bard would sip at strong wine , poured him by a lissome girl , the saqhi . Away from Persia , it was necessary to make do . Once , in Orono , Maine , a chubby ten-year-old was conscripted to play saqhi . How was she to manage not to fidget ? And pretend to adore the poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to do this . But in adolescence , in a school essay , she could say how it had been : It was his voice , raspy , deep , purring , falling like water , that carried me away .... We were alone , he and I , in poetry ... a self-sufficient unit that read poetry and poured wine . As it turned out , the reading lasted over one and a half hours . For me it was over in minutes .. did not understand much of Basil 's vocabulary , topics or historical allusions . His images utterly lost me . I did not know who he was . Yet we experienced something special . We travelled via poetry to places and images far away . Now a collegian , she 'd put that more maturely . No hurry . And someday she 'll get around to reading Brig , gflatts . But that evening she learned the gist of how poetry works .
