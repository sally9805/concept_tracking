 | Nov. 26 , last game of the regular season . Notre Dame with the ball on its own 35-yard line . Irish quarterback Tony Rice takes the snap and rolls left . For a split second , he hints at pitching to his tailback . But that 's all it is ? a feint ? and in a blink Rice is off and running for the end zone , Southern Cal defenders in futile pursuit . Trojan fans fall silent . And in one corner of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum , two normally dispassionate executives slap high fives and dance Irish jigs with strangers in green face paint . Notre Dame rolls on to victory , 27-10 . Phil Motta , 40 , is an advertising man , president of Evans/Phoenix , one of the West 's largest agencies . Russell Hanlin , 56 , is president of Sunkist , the giant fruitgrowers cooperative . Together , they had spent the better part of a year promoting a once obscure sporting event called the Fiesta Bowl ? and with Rice 's TD run , things had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Notre Dame , which had agreed to play in this year 's Fiesta Bowl one week earlier , had ensured its place as the No. 1-ranked college football team in the nation . Meanwhile , West Virginia University , the other team that had signed for the 18-year-old Tempe , Ariz. , extravaganza , was edging toward the top of the rankings as well . Although college football has no official national championship that compares to the NCAA basketball finals , the Jan. 2 Fiesta Bowl suddenly loomed as the next best thing . ( Fan 's note : in the football cosmology of 1989 , Jan. 2 is for all intents and purposes New Year 's Day . ) Virtually everyone would recognize it as the Super Bowl of college football . What many people are questioning , though , is whether that game is n't also an example of how competition between postseason bowl games has heated up to the point where genial rivalries have turned to cutthroat competition . Says Rose Bowl spokesman Bill Flinn : " It 's good there are a lot of bowls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I hope we all do n't do each other in . " The advent of corporate sponsorships in the last four years has made bowl games a huge business . The Cotton Bowl is now the Mobil Cotton Bowl by virtue of a $10 million , seven-year deal ? and it 's competing for attention with the USF &G; Sugar Bowl , the Mazda Gator Bowl and the Sea World Holiday Bowl . Next year we may also be treated to the Federal Express Orange Bowl . Sponsoring corporations want to have their names associated not just with the nationally televised games but also with the parades , pageants and parties that are part of the bowl-game scene ? and they seem willing to pay many millions annually for the privilege . Yet bowl committees no sooner had the newfound money from sponsors than they began to flaunt it . Games that once offered schools $200,000 are now promising 10 times that amount to the national contenders they hope can fill their stadiums and attract big TV ratings . The schools , in turn , use the money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one instance , a study center for student athletes . One reason the bowl-game bonanza got so big so fast is that , purely by chance , many of the best teams in the nation during the past few years were not affiliated with any conference . The Rose Bowl annually pits the Pac 10 champion against the winner of the Big 10 , and so bidding wars are not an issue . But for the Fiesta Bowl committee , which has no ties to any conference , the possibilities are wide open . They and their rivals at , say , the Gator Bowl , can , and do , pursue whichever is the hot team , waving wads of corporate-sponsor money . This year 's Fiesta Bowl actually began taking shape in Phoenix on a quiet day in May . Some 80 coaches and athletic directors flew in for a few rounds of golf and talk , @#  | courtesy of the Fiesta Bowl committee . No one got too serious : Margaritas and sun for the guests , a chance for the bowl reps to give next fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gator Bowl 's beachfront condos on Amelia Island , Fla . Come August , the courtship began to heat up . As football season approached , the Fiesta 's 12-member selection committee began studying preseason reports on such schools as Florida State , Pittsburgh and , especially , Notre Dame , whose followers include millions of so-called " subway alumni " who 've never been near South Bend , Ind . In early September Phil Motta went to South Bend , Ind. , for the Notre Dame-Michigan game for some earnest schmoozing that later paid off handsomely . A month later , Motta and executive director Bruce Skinner dropped in on the West Virginia-East Carolina game . WVU 's athletic director knew that bowl money could help pay for fixing up his stadium . The Fiesta men were impressed by the play of the Mountaineers , particularly that of quarterback Major Harris . A deal was struck . " Some of the other bowls resent the Fiesta for being like the rich new kid on the block who got too rich too quick , " says Holiday Bowl director John Reid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always known we have to go for it , " he says . A successful Fiesta Bowl can generate $30 million for Phoenix businesses . Back in the early ' 70s , the Fiesta Bowl committee never dreamed of competing on such a high level . " We were at the bottom of the barrel , " says executive director Skinner . In 1974 , though , the networks were on the prowl for more sports programming , and the Fiesta landed a modest contract with CBS , and a better one four years later with NBC . In 1981 Skinner boldly decided to move his game to Jan. 1 . And when , at his suggestion , NBC slotted the 1982 game in the dead zone between the Rose Parade and Rose Bowl game , the Fiesta drew healthy ratings . Those Nielsens , in turn , helped attract the attention of Sunkist , which signed a reported five-year , $7 million sponsorship contract in 1985 . The going was n't perfectly smooth at first : NBC instructed its announcers not to mention the sponsor . But when Sunkist bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network changed its mind about the plugs , and the game became a happy event for all concerned . This year 's contest is the second time in the last three years that the Fiesta has served as the unofficial national championship game ( in 1987 Penn State beat Miami ) , and it will pay Notre Dame and West Virginia $3 million each for competing . In the short run , the rich are likely to get richer , if Federal Express 's reported $10.5 million , four-year contract with the Orange Bowl is any indication . But not everything on the bowl front is rosy . The games ' network TV ratings fell 20 percent between 1987 and ' 88 . And the Bluebonnet Bowl , which failed to get corporate sponsorship , folded last winter after 29 years . Still , where there is money there is hope . We have only one year to prepare ourselves for the first Cactus Bowl , in Tucson , and Baltimore 's first annual Crab Bowl . NEWSWEEK JANUARY 2. 1989 63          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
