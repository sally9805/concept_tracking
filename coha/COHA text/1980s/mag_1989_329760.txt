" We are asked to bend the law for someone who broke the law . " Iowa Democrat Tom Harkin was railing against the proposal , which the Senate passed by a 78- to-17 vote last week , to restore Oliver North 's $23,000 military pension . It was halted after his July conviction for destroying Government documents related to the Iran-contra scandal . <P> Some Senators objected to passing what amounted to a private law for North sponsored by Jesse Helms of North Carolina . But Helms was persuaded by Delaware Democrat Joseph Biden to expand the bill so that it would apply to all former military men convicted of similar crimes . If the House concurs , Congress will be favoring government pensions to a select group of convicted felons who served in the military . Not that Ollie needs the money . He earns an estimated $25,000 a speech .
