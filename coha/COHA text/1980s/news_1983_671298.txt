Rico ? Where are you , Rico ? You ' re next ! Mr. Vezza checked his list and surveyed the scene from the stool on which he towered over the steadily increasing crowd . Outside , straining to get a look inside , another crowd crammed against the shop window , whose bright orange signs announce Astor Place Barber Styleist and We feature lamp , Village , Punk , Guido , Razor , Detroit and more . Come on in. // And come in they do . Day after day , especially on Saturdays , the mob scene is repeated , as it has been since last summer . It was then , recalls Enrico Vezza , who with his brother , Frank , owns the shop , I looked out the window one day and realized there were more people in the shop than there were in the street . If it wasn ' t that particular day , he says , it may have been the one when a woman who lives across the way came running over because there was such a crowd she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The green-walled , unstendily lighted Astor Place Barber Stylist is the hottest haircutting establishment in town , if not exactly the newest . It originally opened , according to Enrico Vezza , in 1940 , as the Vezza Barbershop . Enrico and Frank took over the shop from their father and uncle in 1965 . They also bought a few other shops in Manhattan and Staten Island , but sold most of those when long hair meant fewer haircuts. // Once the hard hats and cops began wearing their hair long , we even considered selling the shop on Astor Place , Enrico Vezza said , but we had our neighborhood regulars and we held on to it. // New Yorkers , especially those who live , work or go to school in the Greenwich Village area , set trends , according to Mr. Vezza . And so it was that when , around two years ago , he noticed shorter hair on young East Villagers , New York University students and new residents in the neighborhood , he took action. // up went the Stylist sign , and this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exotic haircuts . ( At the moment , the dozens of signs and hundreds of head shots , including Cutis Sliwa , founder of the Guardian Angels , and the rock group the B-52 ' s , are contending for attention with a lavish display of tinseled Christmas decorations . ) He also began adding chairs and barbers , of which there are now 15 on Saturdays . There ' s a lot of know-how involved when it comes to cutting close to the head , Mr. Vezza says . The fancy salons can ' t do it. // Scott Springer agrees . Mr. Springer , a 15-year-old Midwood High School student , came from his home in Brooklyn to Astor Place on a recent Saturday afternoon for what he described as a center-parted , pushed back cut because , he said , the barbers in Brooklyn are not as good as these guys. // They can ' t be as tired as the barbers in Queens , 14-year-old Joey Rousseau said as he stood patiently waiting for a Guido cut ( short on the sides , short in back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still giving razor cuts , he added disgustedly , over the symphony of electric clippers , snipping scissors , blow dryers and rock music on the radio. // They know what a person likes here , said Lorraine Carpio , a long island City high-school student who gets a not-too-short porcupine-top cut every week because my hair grows fast. // We ' re getting back to the once-a-week haircut , Enrico Vezza said happily . Haircuts are becoming a family affair. // They are for Anne McGiff and her 16-year-old daughter Rebecca , who came from park Ridge , N.J. While her mother asked Gianni for some thing short but conservative , Rebecca , in a nearby chair told Franco she wanted a Detroit , please. // What ' s a Detroit ? John McGiff , Rebecca ' s father asked , duck tail in back , flat on top , longer on the sides , Franco informed him. // A look of panic crossed Mr. McGiff ' s face . Just make it short around the ears , he told Franco. // It was also a family outing for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( short in back , long in front for both ) ; Mickey Alferia and his sister Diane and their cousins Anthony and Max Calicchio , all of whom selected the Little Tony ( slanted sideburns , V-neck , curly top ) and Fran Principe and her 5-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter , who drive in from Norwalk , Conn. , for their cuts. // It ' s hard to find barbers who like kids , and the ones here are all family men , said Mrs. Principe , a designer for Marimekko , who discovered the shop when she went to the Conran ' s next door . We choose the middle-ground styles , she said , some where between the striaght older men and the superwild punk rockers. // On the other hand , Nanette Shaw said , My 13-year-old daughter won ' t come near this place but I ' m in the process of recycling myself , and I ' d like my hair to stand up. // Fifteen minutes and a dab or two of styling gel later , it did . I wonder what Nicole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed her a mirror. // Nearby , Peter Belidis , a 22-year-old computer operator , sat down in Mario Macchiarulo ' s chair and asked for something from the 50 ' s that goes good with the shape of my head. // All the styles that were popular when I started barbering in Italy are popular again , sighed Mr. Macchiarulo , reaching for his electric clippers. // this place is theater ! said Andrew Neal , a dancer , waiting for the manager , Pasquale Gallo , to cut his hair short on the sides , full on top . While the average wait for a barber on Saturday afternoon is 20 minutes , it may be up to two hours for mr . Gallo , who also commands $1 over the regular prices . Women Take More Work // Haircuts at Astor place Barber Stylist cost from $5 to $8 for men depending on the cut , and $7 to $10 for women . Cutting a woman ' s hair takes more work , Mr. Vezza explains . Shaves are $5 ; facials $8 ; perms $35 , colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just off Broadway , is open from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. Monday through Saturday , 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. Sunday. // The barbers are equally obliging when it comes to more conservative styles . Can I just get an ordinary , unremarkale , home-for-the-holidays haircut ? Charlene Adamson asked Enrico Vezza earnestly as she looked around the shop warily. // He nodded and dded her name to the list . Igor , you ' re next , he shouted through the bullhorn . Then Leslie , he said . Can you believe it ? We ' ve already had seven Leslies today. //
