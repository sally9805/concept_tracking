In five cases , the judicial system yields interesting results <P> As the U.S. judicial system seeks to match crimes with punishments , it sometimes succeeds with sure-footed alacrity , sometimes fails entirely and sometimes , like a shaggy-dog story , just goes on and on . In five venues last week , the system offered up examples illustrating all of the above . <P> <P> A RADICAL UNEXPECTEDLY RECANTS <P> Of the seven political extremists charged in connection with the $1.6 million robbery of a Brink 's armored truck in New York 's Rockland County in 1981 , the most notorious was Kathy Boudin , a member of the violent Weather Underground during the late 1960s . Daughter of prominent New York Civil Rights Attorney Leonard Boudin , she had been a fugitive since 1970 , when she fled from a Greenwich Village town house that was destroyed by the explosion of a bomb factory secreted inside . Boudin pleaded innocent to charges of robbery and murder in the Brink 's case , in which a company guard and two local policemen were killed . Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her guilt and accepted a sentencing deal that will keep her in prison until at least the year 2001 . <P> Three others have already been convicted in the case . The defendants , who were drawn from such other vestiges of the ' 60s as the Black Panthers and the Black Liberation Army , claimed they planned to use the " expropriated " Brink 's money to establish the " Republic of New Afrika " in the Southern U.S. Appearing chastened but calm , Boudin told Judge David Ritter : " I feel terrible about the lives that were lost . I have led a life of commitment to political principles , and I think I can be true to those principles without engaging in violent acts . " <P> A WITNESS IS CHALLENGED <P> FBI Agent Benedict Tisa was in his third day of hammering cross-examination by Defense Attorney Howard Weitzman , and he was beginning to get rattled . Tisa had masqueraded as a corrupt banker in the Government scam that snared Auto Magnate John Zachary De Lorean , currently on trial in Los Angeles for conspiring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports-car company . Weitzman questioned Tisa about the log he kept of the four-month investigation that culminated in De Lorean 's arrest in October 1982 . Some of the entries in the 28-page handwritten document were dated 1983 . " I may have rewritten some of the entries in 1983 , " the agent explained . " And you destroyed the original ? " Weitzman asked . " Yes , " replied Tisa , " a portion of them . "
