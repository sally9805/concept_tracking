An American diplomat is another victim of terrorism <P> The husky U.S. Army officer dressed in civilian clothes headed down the staid Boulevard Emile-Augier on his way to work at the U.S. embassy in Paris . Quietly , a man with a dark complexion and frizzy hair began to follow him . Before Lieut . Colonel Charles Robert Ray , 43 , could reach his metallic blue Chevrolet with diplomatic plates , he was killed by a single shot that struck him in the back of the neck . The killer , who was glimpsed by several witnesses , ran down the quiet avenue and disappeared into a crowd of commuters . <P> Except for the outcome , the attack on Ray resembled an assault last November on another U.S. diplomat in Paris , Embassy Charg d'Affaires Christian Chapman . But Chapman had been lucky enough to spot his Arab assailant in time and had escaped a fusillade of shots by ducking behind his car . Security for U.S. embassy personnel had been strengthened after the attempt on Chapman 's life . But Ray , who was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank in the 400-member embassy hierarchy to rate the special protection of a French police car that today follows top officials , or the use of an embassy car and driver . <P> Who killed Ray ? Not the assailant who shot at Chapman , apparently , since the descriptions of the two men do not match . In Beirut , a previously unknown group calling itself the Lebanese Army Revolutionary Faction claimed credit for " executing " the officer because of American " crimes " against the Lebanese people . Western intelligence officials did not know whether the group was an offshoot of the Palestine Liberation Organization , a hit squad from Libya or some other Arab country , or indeed whether the report was simply a hoax . <P> The Ray case illustrated once again the growing problem of defending U.S. diplomats abroad against the threat of abduction or assassination . Some two dozen U.S. embassies abroad have been specially fortified against mob assault , and stepped-up security measures are being used to protect officials living in diplomatic compounds . But U.S. officials admit that it is next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartments , such as Ray , Chapman and Brigadier General James Dozier , who was abducted by the Red Brigades in Italy on Dec. 17 . Officials in Rome said last week that they saw no link between the Ray murder and the Dozier kidnaping . <P> The continuing search produced no solid clues to Dozier 's whereabouts , but did lead to the discovery of some fascinating details about a Red Brigades plan to attack the congress of the Christian Democratic Party on Jan. 22 . Police learned that the Brigades had scheduled the raid for 1:30 p.m. , the hour when live television coverage had been due to begin . While about 15 terrorists would throw grenades and spray the delegates with machine-gun fire , according to the plan , one of their comrades was supposed to dash before a TV camera to read a political manifesto to a horrified nation . Police arrested the terrorists who were to launch the attack , and the congress met as planned .                    @
