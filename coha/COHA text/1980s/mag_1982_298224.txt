But his ark faces rough sailing on the tax hike <P> In a whirlwind of high-pressure politics , Ronald Reagan was waging the most perilous and difficult fight of his presidency . The stakes were high . If he failed to persuade Congress to pass a deficit-checking $99 billion three-year tax hike , the already swollen tide of red ink in the federal budget would rise even higher , swamping hopes for economic recovery and threatening deeper recession . Politically , a President who seemed to have a magic wand for passing major legislation would have shown that he could no longer control even his own party on Capitol Hill . The myth of the Great Communicator 's persuasive powers would be punctured and his leadership gravely impaired . <P> No one was more aware of the risks than Reagan . He drafted a prime-time TV speech to be delivered this week if the House and Senate are ready for a showdown vote on a tax and spending-cuts package that no one really likes . He postponed a vacation trip to California so he could have chummy chats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Camp David . He sent letters to some 5,000 business leaders across the nation , seeking their support . He had the Republican National Committee dispatch some 30,000 pleas in his name for local party leaders to rally behind him . He taped TV spots to be aired in 30 regions in a $400,000 ad campaign by the committee . Overzealous aides even hinted that Republican campaign funds might be withheld from G.O.P. legislators who bucked the President . Reagan disavowed the threats , but the warning hung in the air . <P> The tax increase , Reagan argued , is a bitter pill the nation must swallow to keep economic ills from worsening . He conceded at a Republican rally in Billings , Mont. , that budget deficits are at the core of the problem . ( Even if Congress approves the tax bill and adds $21 billion in fiscal 1983 revenue , the deficit is expected to be as high as $150 billion . ) " For a conservative President like me to have to put his arms around a multibillion-dollar deficit is like holding your nose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to get a grip on the " slippery " deficit , he declared , was to raise revenues . It is " the price we have had to pay " to get more spending cuts through Congress . Reagan placed the blame on past Administrations , declaring , " If I could correct 40 years of fiscal irresponsibility in one year , I 'd go back to show business as a magician . You know , that might be more fun , pulling rabbits out of a hat than jackasses out of the way in Washington . " <P> Unlike last year , when he had to win the support of liberal and moderate Republican " Gypsy Moths " for his tax and spending cuts , Reagan this time was busy wooing rebellious conservatives . He quickly turned around Lyn Nofziger , his former political aide , who had instigated a meeting with New York Republican Congressman Jack Kemp and various New Right ideologues to plot against the tax increase . But Reagan could not budge Kemp , whose political future seems tied to the fate of the supply-side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the President told him last week , " I wish you were with us on this . " Said Kemp later : " We 've just agreed to disagree . "
