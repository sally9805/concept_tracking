WORLDLY GOODS <P> by Michael Korda <P> Random House ; 353 pages ; $14.95 <P> In the publishing business , it is always Springtime for Hitler . As Mussolini shows , the Fhrer is ubiquitous , a major character or a necessary evil hovering off-page . Few authors should understand this better than Michael Korda . When he is not exploiting national anxieties with such books as Success ! or Power ! or Male Chauvinism ! or winning readers with anecdotes about his triumphant Hungarian relatives ( Charmed Lives ) , he is editor in chief at Simon &; Schuster . <P> So it is no surprise to find Hitler making a guest appearance in Korda 's first novel , a tale of success , power , male chauvinism , Hungarians and even a little American publishing . His Fhrer unexpectedly drops in for lunch at Hermann Goring 's , expounds the virtues of vegetarianism and overcomes the Reich Marshal and his companions with a blitzkrieg of uncontrolled flatulence . <P> This is a touch of Mel Brooks rather than Ernst Lubitsch , though elsewhere Korda exhibits a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film maker . Worldly Goods is , in fact , a trove of mimicked styles . Beyond its undeniable entertainment qualities , the book can be read as a clinic on what publishers call a page-turner . The author-editor goes one step further and ensures subliminal product identification , with his name centered at the top of every other page . <P> This display is no coverup . Worldly Goods is a strong story , well told and undoubtedly well edited , about unspeakable betrayal and cold-blooded revenge . As its title suggests , there is a premium on getting , spending and preserving wealth and status . Characters talk in nine and even ten figures . A New York City mistress is taken to Paris for lunch and Cuernavaca for a sunbath . Markets are rigged by big shots who are never out of contact with their intercontinental flunkies ; one even has a telephone in his refrigerator in case he gets a call while " taking " a snack . <P> Korda 's hero commands respect , if not affection . He is a cunning , low-profile zillionaire named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of prewar Hungary 's richest families , survived the Holocaust . Grnwalds were not supposed to go to slave-labor camps . The family 's Jewish bloodlines had been thinned by generations of intermarriage and Roman Catholic conversion . As leading bankers and industrialists , they had powerful friends , including Gring , through whom they sold uranium ore for Hitler 's atomic-bomb research . But in the end the family 's assets were too tempting , their enemies too envious , Adolf Eichmann too literal-minded and a Grnwald too treacherous . He is an uncle who makes a business deal with the Germans and then double-crosses them and his family by escaping to Switzerland . His relatives are left to their fates at the hands of the SS.
