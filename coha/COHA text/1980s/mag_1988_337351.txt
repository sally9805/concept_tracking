Firecrackers exploded over Panama City last week as the main opposition newspaper , La Prensa , prepared to resume publication for the first time since it was banned six months ago . After a government prosecutor returned the building 's keys to the paper 's owners , supporters waved white handkerchiefs and shouted with joy . " This is a victory of the international press , " declared Publisher Ruben Carles , who said the reopening was due to foreign and domestic " pressures " on the government . <P> Nor was press freedom the only area where the regime of General Manuel Antonio Noriega was coming under pressure . The Panamanian strongman angrily rejected a plan to get him to hand over power to a civilian government . Drafted with U.S. backing by Jose Blandon , a trusted Noriega ally , the proposal called for the general to retire by spring and for free elections to be held in 1989 . Noriega responded by having Blandon fired as Panama 's consul general in New York City . <P> The general 's reaction dismayed White House officials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept Panama , prompted by charges that implicated Noriega in murder , drug smuggling and election fraud . According to Gabriel Lewis , Panama 's former U.S. Ambassador , Noriega had asked Blandon for a blueprint that would let him retire without facing U.S. reprisals . Lewis arranged an October meeting between Blandon and Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams , who stressed Washington 's desire for democracy in Panama . <P> Blandon was in Washington last week to deliver fresh charges against his former boss . Republican Senator Alfonse D'Amato of New York , co-chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control , met with Blandon for three hours . D'Amato said afterward that Noriega had apparently used the / Panamanian military to found a " total criminal empire probably as large as any that may exist in the world . " According to the Senator , Noriega 's activities ranged " from drug running , protection , money laundering and arms trafficking to the illegal sale of passports . " D'Amato quickly secured U.S. Marshals Service protection for Blandon and his family . <P> Blandon has been subpoenaed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking into charges that Noriega extracted protection money from drug traffickers based in Panama . Until last week , according to U.S. Government sources , some federal investigators felt they lacked sufficiently compelling evidence to indict Noriega . Blandon 's testimony could strengthen their case  --  especially if , as D'Amato says , the former consul general can provide documents and tape recordings to back up many of his allegations .
