Rick Robey had the last laugh . His road roommate , one Larry Bird , was soaking his hand in an electronic device designed to help heal ailing muscles . Only moments earlier , Bird had removed his still sore right ankle from the same device . " If you re not careful , " said Robey to Bird in Celtics ' locker room after yesterday ' s practice at Hellenic College , " you ' re going to wind up sticking your whole body in that solution . " Ah , life in the NBA . When you have a 31-10 record , it ' s the little things , like the possibility of playing without one of the league ' s top three rookies against a club like the Atlanta Hawks tonight ( 7:30 p.m. , WBZ ) , that adds spice to an otherwise " dull " week . Bird , who jammed a knuckle on his right hand Wednesday , was back at work yesterday as usual . X-rays revealed no serious damage , and he is expected to play tonight with two fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out it wasn ' t broken , " said Celtic coach Bill Fitch . " Larry didn ' t look good today , but he ' ll be able to look good about a week from now . There is no question that he is hurting . Most Birds need their wings . Our Bird needs his feet and hands to win . As good as he is , he ' s still not much of a one-on-one player . " Bird wasn ' t the only player under discussion , nor the only one to be singled out as a result of his play in Wednesday ' s 112-94 victory over New York . Nate Archibald missed a portion of practice after he was accidentally hit by a teammate ' s elbow . When he returned , he found himself being criticized by his coach , which is nothing new , since Fitch says the team ' s playmaker is always in a no-win situation . " People have been saying that Nate has been playing well this season , " said Fitch . " I can think of 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we lost . Now , you can say I ' m being tough on Nate , and you ' re right . But I know he can do better , and so does he . " Nate has a tough job . I understand that , and he ' s probably caught more hell in the 31 victories this year than the other guys did in the 10 we lost , " Fitch continued . " But the only thing I can be disappointed about in him is if that he fails to smile each day . I took him out against New York and he didn ' t get as many minutes ( 33 ) as you might think . But sometimes when a guy isn ' t going well or is making a mistake , you put in somebody else to help build their confidence . You ' d like to find out if Rick Robey and Gerald Henderson are the guys who played poorly against San Antonio Saturday night or the guys who played so well against New York . They need a chance to build up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t really want his club to feel that they ' re having a crackerjack season , just because they now happen to have the best record in the NBA . " We ' re not the best team in the NBA , " he said . " We ' ve had a good half- season , but I don ' t know anywhere in any sport where you win a championship with a good half-season . I want us to be the best club in the NBA at the end of the year . Sometimes clubs hit peaks early and don ' t get better . " However , Fitch added , that this club has an excellent chance of having a good season . " There are a lot of guys here who could make excuses for some of the things that have happened to them this year , " he said . " But I haven ' t heard any , yet . In fact , I ' ve always said that if a guy doesn ' t make excuses , that ' s a sign he is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everybody wants to win . But it is how hard and how much you are willing to pay the price that eventually determines who will . " There are about eight good clubs in the NBA , and any of them is capable of winning . I can ' t say how it might turn out . But I know if we keep the same attitude and continue to work hard , we ' re going to have a good season . "
