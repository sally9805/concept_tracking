The case had sharply divided the many-gabled house of publishing . On one side stood the nation 's major book publishers . On the other were some of its most influential newspapers , including the New York Times , the Washington Post and the Gannett chain . Reporters and editors could be found in both camps . At issue was the media 's right to publish immediately what they regard as news against an author 's right to protect a soon-to-be-published manuscript . <P> The book publishers and authors won the final encounter last week when the U.S. Supreme Court held 6 to 3 that the Nation magazine had committed publishing " piracy " by quoting too liberally from a " purloined " copy of Gerald Ford 's memoirs , A Time to Heal . But the majority opinion , written by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , was so narrowly drawn that even many of those who had sided with the Nation were not seriously upset . " There is always a natural tension between the First Amendment and copyright law , " said Bruce Sanford , general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this does not alter the balance very much . " <P> The case arose in 1979 when the Nation obtained a copy of Ford 's manuscript from an undisclosed source and quickly put together a summary of 2,250 words , 300 of which were direct quotations . The chosen quotes featured the ex- President 's defense of his pardon of Richard Nixon , and Nation Editor Victor Navasky argued that Ford 's own words on the pardon and other subjects were " hot news . " The book 's publishers , Harper &; Row and Reader 's Digest , sued , charging that Navasky had violated the copyright laws and stolen former President Ford 's right to determine the time and place for first publication of his recollections . <P> The publishers sought $12,500 in damages , the amount lost when TIME , which had purchased first magazine publication rights , dropped its plan to print a 7,500-word excerpt . A contract clause had been specifically designed to protect TIME in the event of prior publication by another magazine or newspaper . The publishers won in federal district court . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the unauthorized publication was justified under the fair-use clause of the copyright law . The clause allows protected works to be quoted for purposes of criticism , teaching , research or news reporting . <P> In reversing that decision , the Supreme Court ruled that " the unpublished nature of a work " tends " to negate a defense of fair use . " Wrote O'Connor : " Where an author and publisher have invested extensive resources in creating an original work and are poised to release it to the public , no legitimate aim is served by pre-empting the right of first publication . " The majority made clear that " no author may copyright facts or ideas . " Protection is limited to " those aspects of the work . . . that display the &lt; stamp of the author 's originality . " The Nation 's view that using Ford 's words was " essential to reporting the news story , " said O'Connor , would " destroy any expectation of copyright protection in the work of a public figure .
