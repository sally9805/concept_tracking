A funny thing happened to Felix Ermacora 's report to the United Nations on human rights violations in Afghanistan . The document , the result of a two-week stay by the Vienna University law professor among Afghan refugees along the Pakistani border , catalogs intensified Soviet military operations , continued air raids by occupying Soviet forces against civilian targets , the use of gas and chemical weapons and booby-trapped toys , and torture  --  supervised by Soviet observers  --  in Afghan prisons . <P> But the twelve-page section of the report detailing the most serious accusations was in a separate appendix from the main text . U.N . officials told Ermacora that the separation was a " mistake . " The appendix , moreover , was not translated from English into Russian or any other official U.N . language with the rest of the report . That saved about $100,000 , the U.N . said . <P> The Soviets , for their part , did not acknowledge Ermacora 's report . In the tradition of countering with a good offense , though , the Soviets joined 78 other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly resolution condemning the U.S. bombing of Libya in April .
