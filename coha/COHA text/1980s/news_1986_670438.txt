Mr. Povod will now have to bounce back from this early " success . " We ' ll learn more about his gifts when he writes a play that doesn ' t hit so close to his own kitchen sink , and when that play is cast with regular Joes . In the meantime , theatergoers have every right to be puzzled by the curious lapse in Mr. De Niro ' s otherwise compelling performance as Cuba , a good-hearted , old-fashioned Lower East Side dope peddler ( so old-fashioned he may be the only person in New York who never mentions crack ) . For some reason , Mr. De Niro makes no attempt to fill in the Hispanic background of this character - even though ethnic identity is a pressing , generational issue dividing him and his son ( Mr. Macchio ) . In Martin Scorsese movies , Mr. De Niro has shaved his head ( " Taxi Driver " ) , put on weight ( " Raging Bull " ) and learned to play the sax ( " New York , New York " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail as an accent in " Cuba " ? // Mr. Macchio also has his drawbacks , but he ' s definitely an actor to watch . When " Cuba " first opened at the Public , his performance was a graphic demonstration of what can happen when an untrained actor , however experienced in film , is thrown on the stage . Mr. Macchio didn ' t know how to walk , stand or use his voice . Yet even then , he achieved an affecting account of Teddy , a sensitive teen-ager at sea in his father ' s hostile urban jungle . As those who have endured Mr. Macchio ' s " Karate Kid " movies know , this actor does have presence , even in puerile material . Given a good role in " Cuba , " he has clearly been inspired to work hard : The performance I saw Mr. Macchio give at the Longacre last week showed far more technical skill than before , although he still acts too much with his hands for a karate-less assignment . While we must wait to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equally young Mr. Macchio already has artistic growth to show for the experience. // The biggest star of the summer Broadway season , of course , has turned out to be Robert Lindsay , a man who was unknown in these parts only a month ago . Audiences at " Me and My Girl " feel they are watching a performance for the ages - and they may well be right . Commentators are stuck searching for comparisons . Is Mr. Lindsay the reincarnation of Kelly or Astaire or Chaplin or Cagney or Lupino Lane or Jim Dale ? Perhaps Mr. Lindsay resembles all these prototypes a bit . Like Woody Allen ' s chameleon Zelig , he can instantly impersonate anyone or anything - the trench-coated Kelly of " Singin ' in the Rain , " preposterously stiff Mayfair dowagers , a humpbacked King Richard , the grinning head of a tiger rug . But the total profile of Mr. Lindsay ' s performance defies all comparisons - which is why there is the immense joy of discovery when first encountering him . People will no doubt be comparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlike Mr. Lindsay - or Mr. De Niro - Teresa Stratas did not have the salutary Broadway starring debut she deserved . In the musical " Rags " she was asked to impersonate a turn-of-the-century Jewish immigrant who seemed as true to the Ellis Island spirit as the tourists who wore cardboard Lady Liberty crowns on the Fourth of July weekend . Miss Stratas sang beautifully , but she was denied the opportunity to demonstrate why she ' s that rare diva who also happens to be a sensational actress. // Still , if " Rags " was as mournful as " Me and My Girl " was exhilarating , the shows do have one aspect in common - they are both throwbacks to the musicals of the early to mid-1960 ' s . " Me and My Girl , " a considerably altered revival of a 1937 West End hit , eerily recalls " Half a Sixpence , " the vehicle that made a sensation out of Tommy Steele in London and New York 20 years ago . Both shows tell of Cockney men who inherit fortunes , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their title songs are remarkably similar . Is it coincidence that the conductor of " Me and My Girl , " Stanley Lebowsky , performed the same chore for " Sixpence " in 1965 ? // The director of " Sixpence " back then was Gene Saks , who happens to be the director of " Rags . " But Mr. Saks ' latest endeavor recalls the more high-minded musicals of the 60 ' s , not fluff like " Sixpence . " In " Rags , " a middle-aged couple gets together in an Act II song that ' s an exact parallel to the one sung by a similar couple ( Jack Gilford and Lotte Lenya ) in " Cabaret . " Later , a stern Jewish father belatedly accepts his rebellious daughter ' s suitor in a scene almost identical to Tevye ' s last-minute rapprochement with a wayward daughter and son-in-law in " Fiddler on the Roof . " The various incidents of union strife in " Rags " recall two George Abbott musicals , " Fiorello ! " and " Flora the Red Menace , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel of the rag trade , " I Can Get It for You Wholesale . " About the only major 60 ' s musical that seemed to be missing was " Hair " - a lapse that was remedied when , as was widely reported , the cast of " Rags " held a protest march against the show ' s closing last weekend. // The future of the American theater , someone was saying only a couple of years ago , is the director Peter Sellars . Mr. Sellars had just been hired by Roger Stevens of Washington ' s Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to create an American National Theater . This month - not quite 18 months after the curtain went up on the company - it was announced that Mr. Sellars would take a " one-year leave " from the Kennedy Center , and that his staff was being removed from the payroll . Does this mean that the American National Theater is dead ? No one is saying , but it surely isn ' t thriving . Mr. Sellars is off to the movies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s " On the Road. " // As a director , Mr. Sellars has his adherents and detractors . Surely everyone will agree , however , that he is a genius at publicity . Whatever the American National Theater did or did not accomplish in Washington , it generated a lot of type and hype . In the early stages of the operation , Mr. Sellars announced that his company would not work on " a hit or miss " basis but was planned as " a five-year deal " with " a line of development . " This is the only sensible way to build a national theater , after all - assuming one can be built in a society that impatiently expects instant results and success . But Mr. Sellars ' s credo was for public-relations distribution only : Now that the misses have piled up , he ' s gone on sabbatical . Mr. Sellars ' s stay at his previous post - as artistic director of the Boston Shakespeare Company - also fell well short of the time required to build an institutional theater. // While Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s mind - staging devices recur , whether the author be Gorky or Robert Sherwood - he did give one interview that towered above the rest . The interviewer was Phyllis George during the halcyon period of high camp on the " CBS Morning News , " the one show-biz institution even more hapless than the American National Theater . The occasion was Mr. Sellars ' s opening production in Washington , " Henry IV , Part One , " and one exchange went as follows : // Ms. George : " Peter , you ' ve had some pretty strong opinions about theater in New York. " // Mr. Sellars ( nodding in agreement and laughing uproariously ) : " We should be charitable - they have a right to work. " // And so they do . Among the first productions to appear in the Kennedy Center in the wake of the American National Theater ' s shutdown will be " Vienna : Lusthaus , " as presented by Joseph Papp of New York. //               @ @ @ @ @ @
