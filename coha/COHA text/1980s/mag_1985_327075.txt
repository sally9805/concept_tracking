Just the cadence of their names  --  Dan Ma-ri-no , Joe Mon-ta-na  --  the similarity of their bearing and stock  --  Pennsylvania grimy  --  the disparity of their builds and sun coasts  --  Miami and San Francisco  --  the level of their confidence , the quality of their arrogance , even the way they can make hair curl up under helmets and stand up on necks suggested a confrontation was coming one day . If all of the National Football League quarterbacks were ringed in a battle royal , would n't these two be the ones left standing at the end ? That roughly describes the process of the past four long and occasionally languorous months , during which Marino 's Dolphins lost only two games and Montana 's 49ers merely one . <P> If 19 years of written history have demonstrated anything , it is that nobody can explain a Super Bowl in fewer than 38 million words , but a good description of the coming one is that Miami 's fabled coach , Don Shula , and San Francisco 's brainy Bill Walsh will be secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the sophomore Marino 's Super Bowl essentially , since Six-Year-Man Montana had one three years ago all his own , a special season that Defensive Coach Chuck Studley has particular cause to review . " In my opinion , " says Studley , formerly of the 49ers , currently of the Dolphins , " Montana is the master of the big play . Every time we needed it , 20 eyeballs would turn and look at Joe , and he 'd get 10 ft. tall . He was always that way , even at Notre Dame . Before Marino , I 'd have said Montana was the quarterback . Now I do n't know . " <P> Recording 22 touchdown passes last season , although Incumbent David Woodley was not quite dislodged until the sixth game , Marino became the only rookie quarterback ever elected to start the Pro Bowl . Throwing 55 in 18 games this year , he displaced longtime Record Holders George Blanda and Y.A . Tittle , who took it manfully : " You ca n't criticize a trapper who 's got the skins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind of Hockey Prodigy Wayne Gretzky . By the CBS-New York Times calculations , Marino is already the country 's favorite N.F.L. player ( Chicago 's Walter Payton second , Montana third ) , and in the cautious view of the Miami Herald , " the best quarterback alive . " Even Shula seems to cast Sunday 's game mainly in the context of the wondrous season of this youngest quarterback ever to start a Super Bowl , just 23 . " Everything Dan has done has been some kind of record , " he says . " The records will be so much more meaningful if we manage to win it all . " <P> After the Dolphins won the American Conference championship game , strafing Pittsburgh 45-28 , Marino 's final interview was with former Steeler Quarterback Terry Bradshaw near midfield of the Orange Bowl at dusk . Passing quarterbacks passing in the twilight : a fairly irresistible image . Even when Marino 's gums are not packed with tobacco , there is a flash of boy Bradshaw . " Just as nicely unpolished , " says Rocky Bleier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same quick release , the same compulsion to throw into the coverages . " Police dogs were escorting Marino to his white Corvette in the parking lot . " What a ride he 's on , " murmured Bradshaw , whose Super Bowl ring features four gems . " I 'm going to get me one of these , " Marino said . " Yes , " Bradshaw agreed , " and soon . "
