Mafiosi call off a summit <P> And now , another FBI sting . The public sequel to Operation Abscam and Operation Brilab was Operation Miporn , an abbreviation of Miami pornography . This time , the FBI opened a little pornography business in Miami called Golde Coaste Specialties , Inc. , and began buying sex books , movies , video tapes . After 2 years of investigation , the FBI last week got indictments against 45 alleged pornography merchants in ten states . Said one official : " This wiped out the whole top echelon of the pornography business . " <P> The results of such sweeps-and the FBI now has 50 sting operations under way-are not necessarily that permanent . In the Abscam probe that rocked Congress the previous week , there was little new action except a probe of who had leaked the story . In the Brilab investigation that disclosed official corruption in Louisiana and Texas , high state officials paraded before a grand jury and professed their innocence of all wrongdoings . <P> Some of the most interesting aspects of Brilab , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealings of pudgy , graying Carlos ( " Little Man " ) Marcello , 70 , long the reputed king of organized crime in New Orleans , who has been outmaneuvering U.S. deportation proceedings ever since 1953 . <P> " We own the Teamsters , " Marcello allegedly claimed at one point , while two FBI agents posing as California insurance salesmen kept their secret tape recorders turning . Marcello had told his new-found friends that certain officeholders in Texas and Louisiana could be persuaded to help them land insurance contracts covering state and municipal employees-for fat personal fees . But that , Marcello suggested , was nothing compared with the millions of dollars that could be drawn from the huge health and welfare insurance funds of the Teamsters Union . Marcello claimed that Teamster President Frank Fitzsimmons was too ill to block a change . Allen Dorfman , a Chicago insurance broker and former Teamster consultant who had long held great influence over the union 's pension funds , was about to be removed , Marcello said . <P> The FBI taped the deal offered by Marcello : he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big cut of the union 's insurance ; in return , they had to deposit $2 million in a safe deposit box rented under a fictitious name . <P> The deal was to have been sealed at a gathering in New Orleans this week - during Mardi Gras-of the Mafia 's nationwide controlling commission . It would have been the most important meeting of the mob bosses since their celebrated conclave in Apalachin , N.Y. , in 1957 . The Chicago and New Orleans families were to have pinned down just how to cut the $2 million payoff for switching the Teamster insurance . Another topic was to have been how to recover Mafia dominance of the narcotics traffic . The FBI had hoped that much of the discussion would have been picked up by FBI microphones planted around the hangouts of Marcello , who was to have been host for the meeting . But when Abscam blew into the headlines , the wary Mafia called the whole thing off .
