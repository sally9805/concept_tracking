Many coal-fired plants built tall stacks over the past 15 years as a means of complying with the Clean Air Act , which restricts the deposit of specific pollutants over the surrounding countryside . But dispersal of sulfur dioxide and other substances from the tall stacks has been found to cause acid rain and other environmentally damaging pollution. // The new rules were immediately assailed as inadequate by some environmentalists , members of Congress and state officials , including Attorney General Robert Abrams of New York , who had hoped the E.P.A. would more sharply restrict overall sulfur dioxide emissions as a means of dealing with acid rain. // // Clean-Air Calculations // Today ' s final rules resulted from a lawsuit by environmental groups and the State of Pennsylvania contending that the E.P.A. was failing to enforce the Clean Air Act when it permitted the power plants to spread their pollution over a wider area rather than reduce it. // The new rules change the way tall stacks are figured in the complex computer models used to determine if a source of pollution is in compliance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stacks only up to a height sufficient to keep the plume of smoke from being carried to the ground by downdrafts , and would discontinue a credit for building stacks high enough to carry the smoke over surrounding hills. // The E.P.A. said the regulations , which make a number of other technical changes , would reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by up to 1. 7 million tons a year and would require industry to spend about $700 million in construction and $750 million a year for operation and maintenance . The total amount of sulfur dioxide spewed into the air in the United States is estimated at over 24 million tons a year. // Charles L. Elkins , the environmental agency ' s assistant administrator , said that while the effect of today ' s action would be to reduce sulfur emissions , " it is not designed to be an acid rain program. " // The E.P.A. estimated that about 550 stacks may be subject to the new rules . They would not affect any stack 200 feet tall or shorter , and some stacks as tall as 700 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good engineering practice . " Until the 1960 ' s , virtually no stacks were built as high as 400 feet . <> <> Figures Are Disputed // Mr. Elkins said the change would require a number of plants to install scrubbers , use low-sulfur coal or take other steps to reduce pollution before it leaves the stack. // The National Clean Air Coalition , an alliance of environmental , public health and consumer groups , criticized the agency ' s decision and disputed claims of what it would accomplish . The coalition said its own analysis of the rule showed that it would not come close to achieving a 1. 7-million-ton annual reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions and in fact could cause such emissions to go up in some cases . <> <> New Yorkers Are Critical // Richard E. Ayres , the chairman of the coalition , said at a news conference today that " the policy is a hoax and the claimed reductions are bogus. " // " The policy enshrines the status quo and in some places makes things a little worse , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups intended to go back to court to obtain an adequate rule. // The coalition contends that the law requires polluters to control emissions before they are spewed into the air by using scrubbers or other means . It estimated that as much as four million tons of sulfur dioxide could be eliminated annually by strict regulation of tall stacks. // Mr. Elkins said in an interview that the amount of sulfur eliminated as a result of the new rules might be less than predicted , but he said the Clean Air Act as written , basically concerned with localized pollution , left little flexibility in actions that could be taken with regard to tall stacks. // Mr. Abrams , the New York official , said the new regulations represented " a missed opportunity " to curb acid rain . He added that while his office would put the rules into effect as quickly as possible , " we are seriously also considering further litigation to compel E.P.A. to achieve even greater acid rain control under the tall-stack provision of the Clean Air Act. " // Governor Cuomo of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moynihan , also issued statements calling the E.P.A. decision inadequate and a missed opportunity . <> <> A ' Dance Around the Law ' // Senator Gordon J. Humphrey , a New Hampshire Republican , said he planned to introduce legislation that would " make it undeniably clear that dispersion will not be permitted in place of available emission control . " The New England states have been vocal in seeking Federal action to reduce Middle Western air pollution that is thought by some to cause distant acid rain. // Mr. Humphrey charged that E.P.A. was attempting to " dance around the law . " A spokesman for Senator Humprhey said that Representative Silvio O. Conte , a Massachusetts Republican , planned to introduce similar legislation in the house . <> <> Inappropriate Vehicle // Henry V. Nickel , a partner in the law firm of Hunton &; Williams who represented the utility industry in the tall-stack litigation , said the rules put into effect are a " considerable improvement " over the E.P.A. proposal of last fall , which would have required greater reduction of sulfur emissions and more money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will still impose " harsh penalties " on some power plants , particularly those located in hilly terrain. // Mr. Nickel said that contrary to the environmentalists ' claim , the use of tall stacks by power plants had been entirely consistent with the clean-air law . He also said that there would be no legal justifiction for using the tall-stacks provision of the law as a vehicle for reducing acid rain. //
