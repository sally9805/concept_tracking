Now that 's a big monkey , thought Paleontologist Alan Walker as he plucked the skull fragment from a gully west of Kenya 's Lake Turkana . But that was no monkey . The bone belonged to a 2.5 million-year-old ape-man called Australopithecus boisei . The discovery surprised Walker , since he and most anthropologists believed the boisei species had evolved 2.2 million years ago . " This is probably more significant than almost anything we 've had for a good number of years , " says Anthropologist Richard Leakey , one of Walker 's coauthors of a report about the fossil in last week 's issue of Nature . Leakey 's excitement is understandable : the find casts doubt on a widely held belief that the human lineage arose from the earliest known species of Australopithecus . It also upsets the accepted view of australopithecine evolution . <P> Most scientists agree that the small-brained australopithecines were the first manlike creatures to walk upright , 3.5 million or more years ago , and that their evolution ran parallel to that of humanity 's direct ancestors . The dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johanson , director of the Berkeley-based Institute of Human Origins , think that a single species , Australopithecus afarensis , which includes the celebrated 3 million-year-old skeleton called Lucy , was the common ancestor of all later australopithecines , as well as man . The two branches , they say , split about 3 million years ago , with the Australopithecus line dying out 1 million years ago . Leakey , on the other hand , believes the common ancestor is an older species , which is yet to be found . <P> Last summer Walker , a professor at the Johns Hopkins University medical school , was looking for baboon fossils , when he spotted the skull fragment . By studying volcanic ash and other bones nearby , his colleagues determined the skull 's age . Its pedigree was trickier . It has the structure of a late australopithecine : wide palate , huge rear molars , enormous cheekbones and a pronounced crest of bone running along the top of the skull . But other features  --  a for- ward-thrusting muzzle , an orangutan-size brain and an apelike jaw structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he has argued for years , that Johanson is wrong and that his reconstruction of afarensis is actually based on two different species . And , Leakey says , the new fossil , labeled WT 17000 , resembles one of them . <P> The fossil record had also apparently shown that the australopithecines evolved in an orderly way : first came afarensis , followed by africanus , then robustus and boisei . But the age and form of WT 17000 convinced Leakey and Walker that the lineage was not simple after all . Boisei did not descend from robustus , and probably not even from afarensis . <P> " This skull is the most exciting find since Lucy , " says Eric Delson , an anthropologist at the City University of New York 's Lehman College . " Relationships among australopithecines will need to be somewhat revised . " That will not surprise anthropologists . Although the current diagram of humanity 's family tree is based on thousands of specimens , most of them are frustratingly incomplete . Walker 's fossil may force a revision in the textbooks , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
