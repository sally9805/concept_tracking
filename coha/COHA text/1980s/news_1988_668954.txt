A new kind of cement that hardens in four hours instead of the usual 7 to 14 days was described as a substance that will revolutionize construction Monday by Lone Star Industries Inc. , the company that developed it . Lone Star has high hopes for the product , called Pyrament , which it says will enable road crews to patch expressways overnight , with little disruption of traffic . Airport runways may be repaired in the time it takes for a plane to fly across the country . The new cement not only dries faster than the ordinary variety but also is stronger and lasts longer , Lone Star officials said Monday at a press conference in the Drake Hotel , where the mixture was introduced . Seven inches of Pyrament are as strong as ten inches of regular cement , and the product could quadruple the life expectancy of a highway , the officials claim . Unlike ordinary cement , it also can be used in temperatures below 28 degrees , which could allow construction to be carried out year-round instead of only in warm months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to patch runways . In each case , a 747 landed just five hours after the cement was put down , Lone Star officials said . Houston ' s Love Field and New York ' s Kennedy Airport also have used the product , and a major contract is in the works with New York ' s La Guardia airport , said Michael Jones , business development manager for Pyrament . Pyrament is the result of 10 years of research and development and has been test-marketed in small quantities for 18 months . Lone Star will begin converting all its cement lines to Pyrament production , said Lone Star Chairman James Stewart . Though Pyrament costs nearly twice as much as regular cement , the investment represents long-term savings in time and money , he said . He estimated that the long-term cost of resurfacing a three-mile stretch of a two-lane highway with Pyrament could be cut by $500 , 000 . American cement manufacturers have been looking for a harder , more durable and quicker cement for decades , said Martin Knutson , president of the American Concrete Pavement Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product has to overcome logistical problems , Jones said . " Contractors can ' t react in time because of the difficulties of personnel organization , " he said . Though the cement would be dry in four hours , it takes construction workers longer than that to close a highway , ready it for repair and reopen it , he said . It could therefore be too late for the product to revolutionize repairs to Chicago ' s Dan Ryan Expressway , the second phase of which are to begin in March , with at least as much disruption as the first phase . Jones said Lone Star , based in Greenwich , Conn. , is engaged in studies with the University of Texas to adapt construction industry work methods to the new cement . Stewart said Pyrament will have applications for airports , highways , bridge and building construction , and the oil and defense industries . Lone Star also hopes that the tunnel for the Superconducting Supercollider in Texas will use Pyrament , he said . CAPTION : PHOTO : Tribune photo by Ernie Cox Jr .
