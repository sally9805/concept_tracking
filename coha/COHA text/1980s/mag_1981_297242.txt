Forget Star Wars , with future shuttles zapping each other with lasers and death rays . Those are far , far off , and may never be feasible . But in the wake of Columbia 's triumph , no one at the Pentagon-or the Kremlin-is minimizing the shuttle 's military importance . Even Columbia 's commander , John Young , a former Navy test pilot , could not resist plugging the space shuttle 's military possibilities . Said he , at a homecoming in Houston last week : " I think the American public is going to get their money 's worth out of this baby . It will allow us to do in the ' 80s and ' 90s things we must do for defense . " <P> The Pentagon hopes to replace the Titan , Titan-Centaur and Atlas-Centaur boosters that have long been used to hurl military payloads like the Big Bird spy satellite into orbit . Such rockets are strictly one-shot throwaways , costly to use ( up to $75 million a launch ) and not entirely foolproof ( 5% of the launches have failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliable new lift vehicle that can be employed again and again to put hardware into orbit . But it is much more than that . The Air Force has long dreamed of a permanent , manned orbital platform that could act as a sentry in the sky . In the next five years , at least 21 of the 68 planned shuttle flights have been booked by the military , with the number likely to go up if the Soviets mount a new challenge in space . <P> Military payloads will include new and sophisticated satellites : for photographing , electronic eavesdropping , ensuring secure communications with military units around the world , and providing early-warning systems as well as pinpointing navigational accuracy for everything from ships and planes to nuclear-tipped missiles . Says the commander of the Air Force 's new space division , Lieut . General Richard Henry : " Space is the high ground . It is crucial for collecting and disseminating information , for reducing the confusion of battle . " <P> As early as next year , during the shuttle 's scheduled fourth flight , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : infra-red and laser tracking devices designed to guide future shuttle pilots to orbiting satellites for repair or retrieval-or perhaps for destruction . The experiment 's disclosure has already brought a pained outcry from the Kremlin . Though the Soviets are actively experimenting with military lasers , they charge that the U.S. is planning to introduce laser weaponry into space . <P> By 1985 the Pentagon hopes to be lofting at least some of its own shuttle flights from a military spaceport now under construction at Vandenberg Air Force Base , near Santa Barbara , Calif . The $200 million installation will include a launch pad and a new three-mile-long shuttle landing strip , as well as fuel tanks , shops and other support facilities . It will operate under the control of a new military space center at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs , hard by the North American Air Defense Command 's underground headquarters deep in Cheyenne Mountain .
