American-made shows account for some 70% of the Continent 's programming . Last week , however , the European Community took a step toward reclaiming its prime time from the foreigners . The twelve-nation E.C . adopted rules , to take effect in 1990 , calling on its networks to broadcast a majority of European-made entertainment programs . <P> At stake is not just cultural pride but also megabucks : by 1998 European broadcasters will purchase an estimated $4 billion in programs . U.S. exporters , who have come to rely on foreign sales of their shows , assailed the new rule .

" They said no to competition and viewer choice and yes to trade barriers . " In Congress , some even called for retaliatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the new policy is intended to be merely a political guideline and does not have the force of law . In any case , Lucy lovers have little to fear for the foreseeable future : European producers are not up to creating enough shows to meet the new requirement .
