It is addressed to David Burke , executive vice-president at Capital Cities/ABC News , and Ted Koppel has posted it on the door of his ' ' Nightline ' ' office here at ABC News headquarters in Washington , across the street from the stately Mayflower Hotel. // The letter is real , but the idea is a joke . Or at least an exaggeration. // Two months ago , Newsweek ran a cover story on Mr. Koppel , in which he indicated that in 1975 , then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had offered him the post of assistant secretary of state for public affairs , which he turned down . Today , he said , he ' d want a different post , but the idea of something within the State Department appeals . In the same article , Marvin Kalb Now , we are sitting in Koppel ' s office , a room littered with stacks of mail and books piled all over the desk , tables , and windowsills . Two of the books : ' ' What ' s the Good Word , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Touch , ' ' by Ellen Goodman . There ' s a huge hourglass on the desk , a Marine Corps Marathon poster on the wall , and a red Chinese banner hanging behind the velvet sofa. // It is 5 p. m. , and Koppel and his staff are preparing for the evening ' ' Nightline ' ' broadcast at 11 : 30 . He has removed his jacket and hung it behind the door on a hanger marked ' ' Person to Person , ' ' which , he explains , is a souvenir from the guest room of Edward R. Murrow . ' ' By the time I was nine years old , living in England , listening to this rich , deep baritone on BBC , I had already decided that this was what I wanted to be , a foreign correspondent . It was all based on this image of Murrow. ' ' // Koppel ' s parents had fled Nazi Germany in 1938 , and he was born in England in 1940 . When he was 13 , his family emigrated once more - this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree in speech at Syracuse University and a graduate degree in journalism at Stanford before he was hired by ABC in 1963 - at age 23 America ' s youngest network correspondent . Now , almost 25 years later , his most recent ABC contract will expire Dec. 3. // He indicates that the attitude of Capital Cities/ABC toward news in general is going to be the major factor in future contract negotiations . ' ' As difficult as it may be for the public at large to grasp the point , ' ' he says , ' ' there comes a time in your life and in your career when the easiest thing to negotiate is money . That ' s not tough . If the only thing that separated us were money , the contract would be resolved in 24 hours. ' ' // But these days Koppel is concerned about other things . ' ' I fear we may be reverting to old standards , ' ' he explains . ' ' When I first joined ABC almost 25 years ago , it was not uncommon for announcers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hand it to some man - it was rarely , if ever , a woman then - who had a particularly nice voice , and that person would then read it. // ' ' As the demands upon us become greater in terms of time , the very thing that distinguishes . . . my generation of newspeople , Peter Jennings , Dan Rather , and Tom Brokaw - namely that we did our own work , our own reporting , our own writing - is becoming more difficult to accomplish . It becomes more difficult to sustain , because of the pressures of technology and economics. // ' ' Networks have discovered that programs like ' 60 Minutes , ' ' 20/20 , ' and ' Nightline ' are not only economically feasible to be put on , ' ' he continues , ' ' they are economically profitable . So there is pressure to generate more product and to use the most highly recognizable anchor people to do those products , in addition to their regular , daily work on air . Well , there simply isn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anchoring ' ' Nightline ' ' and ' ' Viewpoint , ' ' has recently substituted as anchor on ' ' World News Tonight ' ' when Peter Jennings was on vacation , has co-anchored the ' ' Jennings/Koppel Report , ' ' and is co-anchoring , with Jennings and David Brinkley , a three-hour ABC documentary on the Constitution , airing tonight ( 8-11 ) . ' ' We don ' t have time to do the research or writing on that - just to read the script carefully and make some suggestions . It worries me that we don ' t have the time. ' ' // Isn ' t his own high salary an integral part of the problem ? // ' ' Precisely , ' ' he responds . ' ' They ' re paying us a lot of money . We are high-visibility personalities . Therefore they feel they must get as much out of these people as they can . From an economic point of view , that makes good sense . From a journalistic point of view , it does not. // ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would do a piece and send it back . Perhaps 24 or 36 hours would transpire between the time I had done the piece and the time it went on the air . If I needed to , I could always modify a script during those 36 hours and then feed it on a radio line to change something . Now , we have instantaneous news , where we are covering events live , where people are required to call upon whatever reservoir of experience they have to help edit while something is on the air live . That troubles me less when it is done by people like Peter Jennings , who has a world of experience , than when it is done by some of the younger correspondents and anchors who have not a whole lot in the reservoir. ' ' // So where does Koppel envision he will be in the next few years ? // ' ' I don ' t know . Look , the changes in economics and technology are going to change the impact that the networks have. . . // ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us still working at the network , and that is a commitment on the part of the network to do things in a more professional fashion , to use the extraordinary resources that only exist at a network . That includes overseas bureaus ; that includes a lot of old and tried-and-true producers and correspondents , who may not be as pretty as they once were but who sure have institutional memory , who can put things into context ; that includes a vast library of hundreds of thousands of tapes that some of these newer organizations simply do not have. // ' ' If all the networks are going to be doing is looking at the bottom line , then they are going to find that , for a while , they will seem to be competing economically very well . But there will be a gradual erosion , and I would not want to be part of it. ' ' // Koppel says he ' s not interested in moving into politics himself . As for other news people doing so , ' ' in principle , it scares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily it can be misused if someone who has absolutely no background in the field would go into it simply because a lot of people recognize him on the tube . But it seems to me that there is something to be said for having somebody at a fairly high level of an administration who is capable of assimilating a lot of information from a lot of different sources , of analyzing that information , and then making that information clear. ' ' // Are we in danger of reaching a point where the public confuses personal popularity with political capability ? // ' ' Sure . I don ' t see how , having lived through seven years of the Reagan administration , the question can still be raised . President Reagan would be the first to admit that the reason he is sitting in the White House today is because he ' s an extraordinarily accomplished communicator . He ' s not there because his background is particularly brilliant ; he ' s there because he was able to take what he knows , or what others were able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was particularly compelling to the American public . Is that good or bad ? I leave it to others to judge. ' ' // Would President Reagan make a good anchor on the evening news ? // ' ' Oh , he ' d be a brilliant anchor . Whether he would make a good interviewer is something else again . But he ' d be a great reader , because he conveys an enormous sense of sincerity . As George Burns once said , sincerity is the secret of success in all kinds of communications . If you can fake sincerity , you ' ve got it made. ' ' // //
