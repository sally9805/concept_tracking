Familiarity breeds nicknames , so it stands to reason that the more we get to know President-elect Ronald Reagan , the more likely we are to call him by any other name . But which one ? Mr. Reagan calls Mrs. Reagan " Mommie , " and she him " Ronnie . " According to the New York Times , Mr. Reagan 's tailor , Frank Mariani , also calls him Ronnie ( " Ronnie is rather conservative " ) . Should we too call him Ronnie ? Or should we call him O &; W ? <P> That evidently is a pet name reporters have given Mr. <P> Reagan , abbreviating " oldest and wisest , " an epithet that originated with Congressman Jack Kemp . <P> " Hello , O &; W " sounds a bit cumbersome , but it could be done . Then there 's that " Dutch " business . <P> Mr. Reagan 's father ( Jack ) observed to Mr. Reagan 's mother ( Nelle ) and brother ( Moon ) that baby Ronald looked like " a fat Dutchman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Ronald was " a bit on the sissy side . " So , should we call him Dutch ? Dutch and Mommie ? Granted , this is not the sort of problem that has the country 's big thinkers in a tizzy , but perhaps nicknames count for more than they appear to . Harry Truman was lucky enough to have his given name sound like a nickname , so as President he had more than a nominal advantage . President Carter , on the other hand , strode into history on the announcement , " My name is Jimmy Carter , and I 'm running for President . " At first we thought we misheard him . Did he say Jimmy ? Oh , there was Jimmy the Greek , oddly . And Jimmy Crackcorn , if you cared .
