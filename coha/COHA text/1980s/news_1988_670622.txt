Although Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward called the slaying Friday " a deliberate assassination " apparently aimed at sending a message to anyone willing to fight back against crack , he and other authorities acknowledge that a more complex motive might have been involved. // Theories abound . For example , investigators are said to be looking at the possibility that a crack dealer from another neighborhood shot and killed Officer Edward Byrne as a way of bringing down " heat " on a rival. // Another hypothesis , offered in the hours immediately after the killing , was that a major trafficker who was sentenced last week to at least 25 years in prison had ordered the killing from his cell to prove to the authorities that he was still in business . <> <> Pressure From Police // Yesterday , teams of police officers swept through crack houses in the area searching for leads , while detectives sifted through hundreds of telephone tips on a special hot-line number . At least 14 people were arrested in Queens , but there was no indication that any were directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesman , Sgt. Maurice Howard , said last night that investigators were examining a tan car believed to be the Oldsmobile Cutlass that witnesses have said was used in the killing . He said the owner of the car , which was found Friday morning , had been questioned by the police . He refused to comment on what the owner of the vehicle told investigators. // Whatever the motive for the killing , the authorities agree that it was almost certainly drug related and somehow linked to the special nature of the drug situation in Queens. // " For one thing , it ' s newer , " Mr. Ward said of the crack trade there . " The people involved in drug operations in Queens are younger - not necessarily in age , but in this type of activity . And they ' ve spread rather rapidly . They were of no major significance in the drug situation - although obviously all drugs are significant - until crack came on the scene. " // Before crack , officials say , narcotics trafficking in southeastern Queens was principally in heroin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime organizations such as the Colombian cartels that operate in the more impoverished sections of downtown Jamaica . <> <> Different Kind of Business // The arrival of crack , a highly addictive cocaine derivative , opened the market to small-business men , traffickers who could set up kitchen-counter processing operations for a few hundred dollars and sell the drug for hundreds of times more on the street. // The result was a level of competition unheard of among the traditional drug traffickers in Queens . It was measured in the sharply higher levels of murders and shootouts , which , starting about three years ago , began terrifying residents not only in poor areas of the borough , but also in affluent neighborhoods near the Nassau County border. // " They ' re not battling the police , " Mr. Ward said of the traffickers . " They ' re battling each other. " // Sterling Johnson Jr. , the city ' s special assistant district attorney for narcotics , agreed . " There ' s no monolithic structure here , " he said yesterday . " There ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best locations and the best customers. " // The police began mobilizing to fight the crack plague in September 1985 , when a major anti-narcotics drive began in the 103d Precinct , to which the officer slain Friday was assigned . Last fall , the campaign was expanded to six other Queens precincts . Between Oct. 1 and the end of January , there were 2 , 350 arrests for sale and possession of drugs , along with the seizure of 10 , 744 vials of crack as well as thousands of dollars in cash and quantities of heroin and powdered cocaine . <> <> Organization Fractured // The police concede , however , that their efforts have barely scratched the surface of the problem . And they have also discovered that there is a bloody paradox in their enforcement efforts. // " We ' ve come down rather hard on them and took out their leadership rather rapidly , " Mr. Ward said of the crack traffickers . " And while that sounds great and we ' ve gotten some convictions and some of them will be sent upstate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing them to scramble to put new leadership in place . And so the war will go on. " // Mr. Johnson is equally pessimistic . " Drug dealers are like hydras , " he said . " You cut off the head , and another grows back. " // The law-enforcement authorities are looking closely at the possibility that those behind the killing of Officer Byrne were the same people believed to have been behind earlier efforts to intimidate the witness he was guarding , a middle-class Guyanese immigrant known only by the name Arjune. // Mr. Arjune , who moved into the South Jamaica neighborhood with his family last September , had angered drug dealers after his complaints led to the arrest of 20-year-old Yusif Abdul Quadir , a neighborhood resident who was charged with possessing six vials of crack. // Hours after the arrest , someone threw a firebomb through a first-floor window at Mr. Arjune ' s home , slightly damaging the three-story frame house on Inwood Street and 107th Avenue. // As the police were arresting 27-year-old Claude Johnson of South Jamaica for the attack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window. // Soon after , another neighborhood suspect , 17-year-old Robert Webster , was arrested . At that point , the police , chastened by the murder the month before of a drug witness named Mildred Greene , ordered a 24-hour guard at Mr. Arjune ' s house . <> <> Two Central Characters // Two imprisoned crack figures from the area , one of whom has been charged with menacing Mr. Arjune last November , are under scrutiny in connection with the killing of Officer Bryne. // One is Lorenzo ( Fat Cat ) Nichols , 29 , described by some as the kingpin of a $10 million-a-year crack-selling operation based a short distance from Mr. Arjune ' s house . On Thursday , he was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison , and investigators say that talk that Mr. Nichols ' s empire is crumbling has drawn eager pretenders to the throne. // The other figure is a man who may be one of Mr. Nichols ' s rivals - or a franchisee . He is 26-year-old Thomas Godbolt , who was convicted of criminal weapons possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened Mr. Arjune. // He has not been linked directly to the firebombings , but law-enforcement sources in Queens say Mr. Godbolt ' s crack salesmen control the area in the immediate vicinity of Mr. Arjune ' s home. //
