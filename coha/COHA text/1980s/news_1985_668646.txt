" Little by little the sky was darkened by the mixing dust , and the wind felt over the Earth , loosened the dust , and carried it away. "  --  John Steinbeck in " The Grapes of Wrath " This is where the dust bowl got its name . Many in this farming town on the Oklahoma Panhandle thought the world was ending when the black blizzards rolled across the Great Plains a half century ago , blotting out the sun and turning day into night . The worst of those dusters struck in the spring of 1935 with whirlwinds so vicious witnesses could not see their hands in front of their faces . Old- timers still describe those rollers as " darker than any night . " " You can ' t imagine the way we lived during those dirty ' 30s , " said Tom Baker , 79 , who still farms a spread west of here . " We had a tight house , " he said , with the windows and doors taped shut . But the dust still got in , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their home . Unlike the Joad family immortalized in John Steinbeck ' s classic , people such as Baker stayed here and toughed it out in the drought-stricken wasteland when their friends headed West with the Okie migrations of the Great Depression . And like their land , these pioneers of the panhandle endured , clinging to the red soil that was homesteaded by their Sooner forebears and later greedily overfarmed , overgrazed and overused . Today the land undulates between green fields and brown furrows , freshly planted and dotted by oil rigs with rocking arms and skyscraping grain elevators . Farmers here are faring no worse than in other parts of a nation beset by troubles on the family farm . Some say it ' s greener than ever before . Agriculture officials contend now that modern farming and irrigation techniques , combined with active government soil and water conservation programs , would prevent a recurrence of the dust bowl disaster of 1932-1938 . But President Reagan ' s budget cuts include an attempt to ax nearly two- thirds of the 14 , 000 employees in the Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its $610 million budget . That prospect worries service employees such as historian Douglas Helms , who points out that America ' s longtime pattern of westward exploration traditionally has been accompanied by " erosion and a decline in fertility . " Those factors set the stage here for the dust bowl years , which Helms believes dramatized the need for soil conservation programs . " It not only caught the farmers attention , it caught the attention of the general public , " he said , noting that expenditures on those programs are " still needed . " Helms , whose Washington , D.C. , office just celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Soil Conservation Act of 1935 , still tells the famous story of how the law ' s passage had been delayed in a reluctant Congress until one day when " a big duster reached D.C. with sundarkening proportions . " Greed has been blamed for at least part of the dust bowl phenomenon . After the Homestead Act of 1862 , settlers squatted on this land in the panhandle , aptly known as No Man ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , the settlers had supplanted the Indians . With World War I , the high price of wheat spurred frenzied production . " Back then , people were tryin ' to make an extra dollar , " said James Tharp , 68 , who still owns his farm in nearby Hardesty , where he weathered the Depression . They farmed and plowed up " every square inch , " he said , destroying the topsoil and protective layer of grass . When the severe drought came in the 1930s , the wind stripped the vulnerable land and raked the dust into the skies . In a series of interviews , Tharp and other elderly farmers around the panhandle who lived through it showed a near unanimous reluctance to rule out the possibility of another dust bowl . To a man , they think it ' s unlikely , but their weathered faces are cautious . They remember how farmers once prayed for rain through dust-caked lips , and they all have vivid recollections of what they were doing on Black Sunday , April 14 , 1935 , the day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Woodie Guthrie began writing " So Long , It ' s Been Good to Know You " during this granddaddy of rollers . " Worst of all  --  total darkness , " wrote Grace Bolar of Optima , Okla. , in her scrapbook of storm highlights that month . Baker was trapped in a Model A Ford after a rabbit drive , which actually was an organized hunt by farmers because the prairie was inundated with rabbits . He and his wife , Dessie Lee , tried to hold wet handkerchiefs over daughter Doris ' mouth while the 2-year-old squirmed . They stumbled blindly to a vacant farmhouse nearby for refuge . When the storm hit , Tharp also was caught in a car returning home from dinner at his grandparents on Black Sunday . When some visibility returned , he said , " I got out and walked beside the car along the ditch to guide ( his father at the wheel ) all the way to the house . " Charlie Beer , 84 , and his wife , Minta , 76 , who still own a farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a beautiful day " in late afternoon . " That was the one storm that we went to the cellar when it was comin ' up , " Mrs. Beer said , " and it was just black . That ' s all you can say . It was terrible black . " Robert Geiger , a roving reporter for the Associated Press , phoned in a story on the storm from Guymon that referred in the lead to " the dust bowl of the continent " and was carried the following day in the Washington Evening Star . The phrase was immediately picked up , and Guymon became known as the hub of the dust bowl , the heartland of which was a five-state area plagued by unprecedented drought , soil erosion , crop failure and churning dirt storms that raked the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas , and nearby parts of Kansas , Colorado and New Mexico . " More people left , I believe , than stayed in our part of the country , " Tharp remembers of the dust bowl era . " It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it together , " he recalls . " You couldn ' t hardly beg for a job . There just wasn ' t no money . " But people stayed because they were too poor to leave and couldn ' t afford the trip . Or because the land was their family ' s only heritage . Or because they had faith in God . Later , they resented the way Okies were portrayed fleeing in " The Grapes of Wrath . " " This was God ' s country , " said Charlie Beer in an interview . " This was the best place we ever lived . I asked the Lord what to do , and the Lord said , ' You better set still . You ' ll eat just as well here as you will if you move on . ' So I stayed . But I thank the Lord everyday since then . " Beer ' s wife of 58 years watched him as he spoke . " Everybody was leaving , " she interjected . " I was sure tired of this dirt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I didn ' t sit down and cry , but it was terrible to clean up all that dirt . You couldn ' t do anything about it . " She reflected on their struggle a moment , noting that at one time they picked up scrap iron to sell for grocery money . " It ' s turned out a lot that did leave came back , " she added . " We ' ve never seen anybody that left , of all our friends , that had any happier life or any better life , as far as I can see . " With 7 children , 14 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren , the Beers have their health , 1 , 600 acres and plenty of people to visit . " I ' m real thankful that we stayed , " Mrs. Beer said . " It ' s so peaceful with the wheat out there and the birds singing and the pheasants crowing . The only problem is the wind . " Beer agrees : " I worry about it , but I ' d still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten miles south of here in Goodwell , Okla . , Joan Kachel works as curator of the No Man ' s Land Historical Museum , and she says people such as the Beers " are what my purpose in life is : to tell their stories . " The little museum on the east edge of the campus of Panhandle State University is a treasure trove of relics from the panhandle and includes extensive archives on the dust bowl . Taking aim at Steinbeck ' s novel , Kachel also says : " We don ' t like to be thought of in those terms . We don ' t think of ourselves as being backwards . We were down and out , but we still had a determination to stay . " One of the clippings in the museum shows a yellowing photograph of a bleak , forlorn scene that typified the dust bowl : a lone , gnarled , lifeless black locust tree with a nest built by crows out of barbed wire near Dalhart , Tex . The 1938 photo was distributed around the world as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distress . In Texhoma , Okla. , a town on the Texas-Oklahoma state line , Freddie Lucas , 62 , a retired deputy sheriff , recalls Black Sunday . He was 12 , and that was the day of his grandmother ' s funeral . The family was on the highway between Boise City and Texhoma when it hit , and they had to turn back . " I don ' t think people could ever make it through it ( the dust bowl ) today , " said Lucas . " They don ' t have the fight in them they used to . " The dust , he said , ruined clothes , got into the eyes and ears and gave many fatal cases of dust pneumonia . Things were so destitute in those days that one eastern panhandle town was named Slapout , Okla . Brice Jackson , 81 , who had a farm near Slapout , said that the name came from Tom Lemmons , who started a filling station along the highway in 1933 and often ran out of supplies . When customers asked for something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ' m slap out . . . . " In Gate , Okla. , near Slapout , Laurence Drake , 78 , recalls Black Sunday , too . It was his 28th birthday , and he was trapped in an alfalfa field beside an irrigation ditch when it went " from daylight to blackness . It was pitchdark for 20 minutes . " Since then , he has worked at soil and water conservation so that such naive mistakes would not be repeated . " Now , all the farmers are conscious of their land blowing and leave residue on the ground ( to protect the soil ) and do all they can do to keep it from blowing , " he said . Donald Bartolina , a federal district conservationist in Oklahoma City , said that farmers also have developed more drought-resistant varieties of crops , better methods of irrigation and protection and faster techniques for farming . " We don ' t ever think we ' ll get into the conditions that the land got into in the ' 30s , " Bartolina said . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our modern technology , we know how to handle it now . " But Tom Baker recalls all the droughts for 50 years , " even in good years , " and he strongly disagrees : " Oh , yes , we could . Let me tell you , if it stays dry as long as it did back there , and if the wind blows as much as it did back there , we ' d have the dust bowl just like we had it back there .
