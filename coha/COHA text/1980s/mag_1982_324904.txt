An accused Arab terrorist is sent back to Israel for trial <P> Despite the currently icy relations between the U.S. and Israel , Washington recently sided with Jerusalem in a little-noticed case that has stirred a furor of protest in the Arab world . Ziad Abu Eain , 23 , a Palestinian Arab and citizen of Jordan , was extradited from the U.S. to Israel two weeks ago to stand trial on charges that he set off a bomb in the Israeli resort city of Tiberias in May 1979 that killed two youths and injured 36 others . Abu Eain ( rhymes with plain ) and his supporters have fought a 2-year battle in U.S. courts against the extradition order , and the controversy refuses to fade away . <P> Foreign Minister Marwan Al Qasem of Jordan fired off a message to Secretary of State Alexander Haig expressing his country 's " sorrow and pain . " Chedli Klibi , secretary general of the Arab League , denounced the move as an " American crime . " Palestinians demonstrated against the action in several West Bank towns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Abu Eain 's attorneys : " This decision will come back to haunt the U.S. " <P> The Israeli charges against Abu Eain were based on the testimony of Jamil Yassin , an admitted member of the Palestine Liberation Organization who was arrested for a string of bombings , including the Tiberias explosion , in June 1979 . Israeli soldiers found in Yassin 's home in Ramallah what one Israeli security officer described as a " bomb factory , pure and simple . " Yassin confessed that he built the bomb and recruited Abu Eain to plant it in Tiberias . Yassin was sentenced to life imprisonment , but Abu Eain had already fled Ramallah to visit a sister in Chicago . Israeli officials asked the U.S. to send him back to Israel to stand trial . On Aug. 21,1979 , FBI agents picked up the suspect in Chicago , and the extradition process began . <P> By the time Abu Eain 's hearing was held in Chicago before Federal Magistrate Olga Jurco in the fall of 1979 , Yassin had repudiated his testimony and insisted that Abu Eain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moreover , produced affidavits from a dozen friends and relatives , who swore that at the time of the bombing he was in Ramallah , a two-hour drive from Tiberias . Jurco nevertheless ruled that there was " probable cause " to believe that Abu Eain may be guilty ; in effect , she held that the conflicting evidence should properly be aired in an Israeli court . The judge also ordered that Abu Eain be held without bail , a common practice in extradition cases . <P> The defense lawyers argued that whether or not he was guilty , Abu Eain could not be extradited because he was being charged with a " political offense " ; the 1963 extradition treaty between the U.S. and Israel allows for the exemption of political prisoners . The State Department , however , advised the court that " exploding a bomb is not an offense of a political character but of terrorism . "
