Politicians report that what they call the gender gap is showing up widely in campaigns from coast to coast . Their campaign polls usually find Democrats getting more support from women while Republicans have more backing from men , but women vote in greater numbers than men. // Facing this unaccustomed divergence , both parties are concentrating on women . Although they share some tactics , such as greater use of daytime television , the parties argue over whether the Reagan Administration ' s economic and budget policies have hit women hardest . Many Republicans are seeking to shield themselves from the effects of women ' s dislike for the Administration , shown repeatedly in national polls , by emphasizing education or the elderly in their campaigns. // // Effect on Cuomo Campaign Seen // But right now , according to the latest public polls of campaigns , women ' s support is providing a lead for such Democratic gubernatorial candidates as Mario Cuomo in New York , Bill Clinton in Arkansas and Tom Bradley in California. // Heavier backing from men , the polls show , provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate candidate in California ; Terry Branstad , the candidate for Governor in Iowa , and Senator Harrison H. Schmitt of New Mexico leading their races. // In other races , a candidate found by polls to be in the lead shows a greater lead with one sex than with the other . For example , Senator David H. Durenberger , a Republican , has a lead of 15 percentage points among men over his challenger , Mark Dayton , in Minnesota , as against only a 5-point lead among women . And in some contests , like the Missouri Senate race between Senator John C. Danforth and State Senator Harriett Woods , polls show the respective gender advantages to be equal and to cancel each other out. // There are few public polls of individual House races . But the latest Harris Poll , based on interviewing from Oct. 9 to 13 , found that while men divided 48 percent to 43 percent in favor of Democratic House candidates nationally , women provided Democrats with a more decisive edge of 53 to 39 percent. // Nancy Sinnott , executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dozens of polls of individual races and said she usually found Republicans getting 3 or 4 percentage points less support from women and more from men than do Democrats. // Seeking to exploit the difference , Democrats are working with women ' s groups to encourage heavier voting . " Get Out the Women ' s Vote Day " is to be proclaimed Saturday by governors in several states , and the Democratic National Committee has mailed all Democratic candidates advice on how to capitalize on this . <> <> More Votes by Women Than Men // There are more women in the population and more votes have been cast by women than by men since about 1964 . On a percentage basis , according to Census Bureau studies , the percentage of women who voted was lower than that of men until 1980 , when they were equal . The findings of increasing turnout , especially among younger women who appear more alienated from Mr. Reagan and his party , have spurred Democratic interest. // Ann F. Lewis , political director of the Democratic National Committee , recently wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get Out the Women ' s Vote Day. " // The Republican National Committee has sought to counter this trend with mailings that argue that the Administration ' s record of appointing women is " impressive , " that Mr. Reagan has a " wholehearted commitment toward insuring equal opportunities for women " and that " homemakers and working women have benefited from the President ' s economic recovery program . " <> <> He Sees Recent Change // William Greener 3d , director of communications for the committee , said : " We realize we have a problem . We are working to decrease it . " He said he thought women in recent weeks had come to have a greater appreciation of what he termed Mr. Reagan ' s peace initiatives and success in fighting inflation. // Nevertheless , he said , the divergence between male and female voters means " Republican candidates have ground that they have to make up. " // One Republican consultant , Roger Stone , said the effects of the divergence had not turned out to be " the sea change problem we thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stressed their commitments to issues such as education and equal pay. // But John Deardourff , a producer of television commercials for Republicans , said the problem was serious . " Women in every different age bracket have a different reason to be unhappy with Republicans , " he said . The youngest adult women may be unhappy with cuts in student loans , he said , while those up to about age 40 are concerned over day care and equal access to jobs . Middle-aged and older women are worried about Social Security , he said . <> <> ' How You Like Their Dresses ' // Moreover , Mr. Deardourff said , Mr. Reagan does not seem sensitive to current women ' s concerns . " Ronald Reagan comes from a background where the nicest thing you could do for women is to open the door for them and tell them how much you like their new dresses , " he said. // Republicans such as Miss Sinnott and Mr. Stone argue that the gap is not as wide as earlier this year , and there is some evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the personalities , tactics and records of individual candidates affect the impact of the gap , state polls this year show it is making a difference . <> <> Poll Results in New York // Last week ' s New York Times poll of New York found Lieut . Gov . Cuomo barely trailing , 44 to 47 percent , among men who were likely voters in his race with Lewis Lehrman , the Republican candidate for Governor . But he led , 52 percent to 44 percent , among women and 48 percent to 41 percent overall. // A poll by KATV in Little Rock , Ark. , early this month found former Governor Clinton leading Gov . Frank D. White , a Republican , by a 53 to 25 percent margin among women , enough to overcome a slim deficit of 45 to 42 percent among men . Mr. Clinton ' s overall lead was 48 percent to 34. // Mayor Bradley of Los Angeles led Attorney General George Deukmejian , a Republican , by a margin of 48 to 41 percent in a Los Angeles Times Poll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with an edge for Mr. Bradley of 46 to 44 percent , but Mr. Bradley had a lead of 49 to 38 percent among women. // But in the other key California race , the disparate gender preferences helped the Republican Senate candidate . Mr. Wilson and Gov . Edmund G. Brown Jr. , a Democrat , were about even among women , with Mr. Wilson getting 43 percent and Mr. Brown 41 . But Mr. Wilson led by 49 to 41 percent among men and 46 to 41 percent overall . <> <> Durenberger-Dayton Margin // The Minnesota poll of The Minneapolis Star and Tribune , released Oct. 3 , gave Mr. Durenberger a lead of only 50 to 45 percent among women , but a lead of 56 to 41 percent among men .
