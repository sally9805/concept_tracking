" That ' s a business risk we have decided to take , " Phil Krueger , the assistant to the Buccaneers ' owner , Hugh Culverhouse , said yesterday from Tampa , reiterating the Buccaneers ' intention of using their first pick for Jackson. // The risk the Buccaneers face is that Jackson , the 1985 Heisman Trophy winner who has been described as the best running back to leave college for the N.F.L. since O. J. Simpson , will forsake football to play baseball . For , while his future success in football would be almost assured , baseball scouts are raving that he has the potential to be just as successful as a major league outfielder. // " The reports I have seen on him are outstanding , " said Doug Melvin , a vice president for the Baltimore Orioles who is in charge of their scouting department . " He has the tools to be a superstar . The two things a player of that caliber are born with are power and speed . He has both of them . At this point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Kirk Gibson at the same point in their careers. " // The possibility that Jackson could succeed at either sport has served as a backdrop for weeks of conversations involving Jackson ' s lawyers , the Buccaneers and other N.F.L. clubs interested in trading for Jackson . The talks continued though the weekend in Tampa , as Jackson ' s lawyers met with Culverhouse . But none of these critical questions was clarified to any great degree : // * Which sport would Jackson prefer to play ? // * If the Buccaneers draft him , would he sign with them ? // * Would he sign with another N.F.L. team if the Buccaneers traded the pick ? // At this point , the answers , in order , are : He ' s not sure , probably not , and maybe. // " Right now , I would say it ' s 50-50 between baseball and football , " said Richard Woods , one of the three lawyers from Mobile , Ala. , representing Jackson . " Bo loves baseball . He started playing baseball first , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , which is not the case with football . He enjoys football . But it ' s not the same to him . He knows he could get more money to start in football , but money is not the only consideration , and it will not be the deciding factor . He first wants to see what his options are . " <> <> June 2 a Key Date // Jackson will not know what his options are until June 2 . That ' s the first day of the baseball amateur draft . The Pittsburgh Pirates have the first pick ; they have said publicly they will not take him . The Cleveland Indians have the next pick . They refused to comment on what they might do. // That may not matter anyway . Jackson ' s lawyers said they intend to investigate the possibility of Jackson ' s playing for the Orioles , the Los Angeles Dodgers , the California Angels , the Mets or the Yankees , whose drafting positions are , respectively , 15th , 20th , 21th , 22d and 25th . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . , Jackson visited the California Angels . Before their game , he met with one of his boyhood idols , Reggie Jackson , who is not related to him . They spoke for almost an hour , and a source familiar with the conversation said that Reggie told Bo the best organizations to play for are the Yankees , the Mets , the Orioles , the Dodgers and the Angels. // " The talk with Reggie impressed Bo , " the source said . " That got him thinking about baseball more than before. " // In the days following Bo ' s visit to California , his lawyers set out to determine how much money he should get for his first football contract . At the same time , the Buccaneers began hearing from other clubs interested in trading for the pick . It was preliminary on both counts , but the results of the work and inquiries went far toward creating the uncertainty as the draft approaches. // Because of his unwillingness to commit to football , Jackson ' s lawyers and the Buccaneers , through yesterday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfunctorily , " in Krueger ' s words. // And as the possibility of his playing baseball remained , football trade talks continued . <> <> An ' Obvious ' Attraction // " We don ' t see baseball as an alternative for him , at least not from the financial standpoint , " Krueger said . " But I don ' t know what his preferences in life are . If it comes down to success and his ability to play , then obviously he ' ll go to football . But in all honesty , from the research I have , the figures are going to be substantially less in baseball. " // Woods agreed . " But look at the life of an average baseball player , " he said . " Even if Bo were the highest-paid player in the N.F.L. , he can play baseball for 18 or 20 years. " // As a safeguard against the possibility that Jackson ' s priorities in life will not necessarily get him to Tampa Stadium , Krueger has listened to any club that called. // One , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two first-round draft choices - this year ' s , which is the 18th pick over all , and next year ' s - plus two of five players , whom Krueger called " older players or ' name ' guys on the way down . " A source familiar with the list said the five players were : the center Randy Cross , the guard John Ayers , the tackle Keith Fahnhorst and the defensive backs Ronnie Lott and Carlton Williamson. // The Buccaneers , the source said , were more interested in younger players , like the linebacker Keena Turner , the running back Roger Craig and the wide receiver Jerry Rice . <> <> No Compelling Offers // Other teams that expressed interest were the San Diego Chargers , the Washington Redskins , the New England Patriots , the Kansas City Chiefs and the Seattle Seahawks . But no offer , so far , has compelled the Buccaneers to continue conversations. // " The 49ers ' pitch was simply not acceptable to us , " Krueger said . " We ' re willing to listen to offers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . It ' s a matter of enhancing our team . All we ' re asking is for something to enhance our team , not something that ' s good for them and not us . I didn ' t just fall off the turnip truck. " // Are there any circumstances under which Jackson would sign with the Buccaneers before the baseball draft ? // Certainly . " With an outrageous contract offer , " said Woods , figuring that one is probably not forthcoming . By their own reasoning , Woods and his partners , Jack Miller and Tom Zieman , have decided that Jackson should be worth more than Steve Young , the Buccaneers ' quarterback who is earning slightly less than $1 million a year. // " But as we have said all along , money is only going to be one factor , " Woods added . " And at this point , I think it would take extraordinary circumstances for Bo to do anything before the baseball draft . " <> <> Looking for a Winner // As for signing with a team that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract it is possible . Jackson has told his lawyers that he would prefer to play for a team in a warm-weather city and for a team that has a winning tradition . Since they last made the playoffs , in the strike-shortened 1982 season with a 5-4 record , the Buccaneers have finished with records of 2-14 , 6-10 and 2-14. // " The competitive nature of the team is very important to Bo , " Woods said. // Jackson is hardly the first quality football player to talk about baseball as a viable option - either for financial reasons or because he simply wants to play baseball . In 1983 , after John Elway had spent a summer at the Class A level in the Yankees ' farm system , he told the Baltimore Colts , the N.F.L. team that drafted him , that he would sooner continue his baseball career than sign with them . At first , the Colts didn ' t believe he would . Rather than take a chance , however , they traded Elway to the Denver Broncos soon after the draft. // Krueger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson . But that , he said , will make no difference to the Buccaneers at 8 A.M. tomorrow. // " We have already ' think-tanked ' that through , " Krueger said . " Baseball has no effect on us . We intend to take him. " //
