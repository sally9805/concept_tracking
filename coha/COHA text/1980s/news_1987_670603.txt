Mr. Jacoby ' s recent book , subtitled " American Culture in the Age of Academe , " has received wide attention in the major newspapers and magazines , and has to be considered the kind of success that would make many of his academic colleagues envious. // The book has been seen by some as a kind of leftist companion to Allan Bloom ' s best-selling conservative indictment of modernity , " The Closing of the American Mind . " Both books are powerful laments over modern times and harken back to earlier , supposedly richer eras. // Mr. Jacoby ' s central thesis is that the life of the American republic has been impoverished because there are so few intellectuals these days trying to help explain the world to the general public . The university , he argues , exercises a monopoly over the life of the mind such that the younger generation of thinkers , in sharp contrast to their elders , lives in a straitjacket of professionalized academic jargon incomprehensible to nonspecialists . Thus , these intellectuals have given up talking to the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can understand . <> <> Part of the Problem // But Mr. Jacoby , even while making a stir , sees himself , as he put it , as " part of the problem . " At 42 years of age and with a Ph . D. in European history from the University of Rochester , he is a graying , unemployed member of the diploma-laden club whose collective failure he laments . And so , he is twice disappointed : first , that his generation has not produced its share of what he calls " public intellectuals " and , second , that his much-noted effort to point out that failure may have placed obstacles in his own academic path. // " I don ' t know what to do , " he said recently over lunch at a diner in Marina del Rey , not far from the modest stucco home he shares with his wife , Naomi Glauberman , and their two young children . " The issue is how to make a living . It ' s almost impossible these days as a free-lance writer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new academic job with this book . " <> <> Grant for an Astronaut // " Maybe , " he said sarcastically , " I should just retrain as an aging Jewish astronaut and apply for a grant. " // " The Last Intellectuals , " published by Basic Books , begins by noting a " missing generation . " There are , it contends , hardly any intellectuals under 45 who are known to a wide public . The " last intellectuals " are thus the same figures who have been writing for the public for the last three decades and more , such as William F. Buckley Jr . , Irving Kristol and John Kenneth Galbraith. // Life has become too expensive for intellectuals to sustain themselves outside of academia , the book argues . As a result , Mr. Jacoby ' s own leftist generation , which emerged from the radicalism of the 1960 ' s , has had to accept university careers ; and the university , he contends , imposes a dull conformity on the community of scholars . <> <> Sympathy for Radical Thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily and happily everybody settled down into their professions , " Mr. Jacoby said . " I wasn ' t expecting them to transform the world , but I ' d be happy if there were , say , a critical , forceful sociology . Instead , there are 5 , 000 sociologists out there who only talk to each other. " // Mr. Jacoby acknowledges sympathy for the lines of radical and Marxist thought that emerged in the 1960 ' s . It clearly marks him from Mr. Bloom , a University of Chicago philosopher and political scientist whose " Closing of the American Mind " seems otherwise to bear some spiritual affinity to " The Last Intellectuals. " // But Mr. Jacoby finds little of value in the actual products of recent Marxist scholarship and agrees that there is " convergence " between himself and Mr. Bloom . He says both writers yearn for what Mr. Jacoby calls " a return to critical standards and objective truth. " // Mr. Jacoby , however , accuses Mr. Bloom of " wrapping his point of view up in an authoritarian framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning , but of memorizing and worshiping these eternal truths. " // In any case , even if Mr. Jacoby has been seen by some as a leftist Bloom and been praised for his perceptiveness in describing a major change in American intellectual life , a striking fact is that his book has been equally disliked by some on both the left and the right . <> <> ' Nothing Left to Say ' // Nathan Glazer , a conservative sociologist at Harvard University , wrote in The Wall Street Journal that Mr. Jacoby left an essential ingredient out of his analysis : that " Marxists and neo-Marxists " no longer effectively address the public " because they have nothing left to say. " // From the other side of the spectrum , Walter Kendrick , reviewing " The Last Intellectuals " in The Village Voice , accuses Mr. Jacoby of uttering " a yelp masquerading as an argument . " Mr. Jacoby is said to have " ' taught most recently ' at the University of California , San Diego , " he wrote , citing the book ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get tenure , " Mr. Kendrick speculated . " He wrote ' The Last Intellectuals ' instead. " // Indeed , Mr. Jacoby does not have tenure , or a job , at any university . He has alternated periods of free-lance writing with one-year teaching posts at a half-dozen different schools , living the life of a kind of migrant laborer that illustrates his judgment of the intellectual ' s present difficulties . <> <> Attacks on the Greats // " The Last Intellectuals , " he said , emerged from research on an earlier book , " The Repression of Psychoanalysis , " in which he noted that there was no great successor generation in this country to the immigrant titans who created psychoanalysis here . Then , he noted a similar absence of greatness among younger intellectuals in other fields. // Whether the complaints are true or not , one striking aspect of Mr. Jacoby ' s new book is that it attacks some of the greats by name . It revises downward , for example , the work of New York intellectuals like Irving Howe , Lionel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual academic politeness by lampooning dense prose that passes for scholarship. // This is one area where Mr. Jacoby admits to a certain reckless disregard for practical consequences , saying that he has , perhaps foolishly , " let the chips fall where they may. " // Noting the similarity of some of his themes with those of " The Closing of the American Mind , " he says that Mr. Bloom , in indicting modern academic culture , does not name names. // " His is actually a very safe book , " Mr. Jacoby said . " He ' s too veiled , whereas I take the foolish risks. " // " It ' s suicidal , " he went on , returning to his concern with finding a job in the very academia his book ridicules . " It ' s clear that this was not a smart book to write if you ' re looking for the call from some university. " //
