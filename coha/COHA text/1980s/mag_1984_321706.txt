" We are not ready to endanger our security , but we shall look for ways of making peace " <P> Hoarse from campaigning but buoyant over public opinion polls that show his party in the lead , Labor Leader Shimon Peres discussed the upcoming election last week with TIME Correspondents Harry Kelly and David Halevy . <P> Excerpts : <P> On His Platform . Message No. 1 is that we are calling for the unity of the people . Message No. 2 is that we have to return from an economy of the privileged to an economy of permanent work . <P> Message No. 3 is that while we are not ready to endanger our security , we shall look for ways of making peace . We believe in both security and peace . <P> On the Economy . The people are basically divided into two groups : the haves , who are in good shape but do not have confidence in the future , and the havenots , who can hardly make ends meet . We do not believe that austerity will serve a purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political wings , not from social programs , and in reaching a social contract between trade unions and industry . We will not permit the increase in the standard of living to exceed the increase in production . We would like to direct savings into industry , agriculture and tourism . If this is done , we shall again be able to mobilize investment in Israel . <P> I would like to see Israel acting economically as a university and socially as a kibbutz . Since we are such a small country , everything must be based on science and technology . We have the potential to introduce human cooperation and mutual aid-to create again a spirit of pioneering . <P> On the West Bank . We would stop building settlements in the densely populated Arab areas . The Likud spent something like $3.5 billion over the past seven years in the West Bank with very modest results , an increase of 15,000 Jewish settlers . That is a tremendous price , so we are going to cut it . <P> In addition , we are going to suggest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on the Camp David agreement . We would like to have representatives of Palestinian groups in the Jordanian delegation , but not the P.L.O . <P> Many of us understand that to incorporate 1.4 million Arabs against their will in Israel will simply endanger the future and destiny and character of Israel . We would like to see a joint plan comprising all countries for the economic and social development of the Middle East . Our vision is that Israel will excel not just as a military force but in offering aid and support to pacify the region , develop its people and move ahead together . <P> On Lebanon . We feel that within three to six months we can introduce the necessary measures to make the Galilee a safe place , enabling us to bring our boys home . We want to establish an early warning system in southern Lebanon , and to have a mobile force in northern Israel . We want to strengthen the southern Lebanese Army , supported by the local people , and to have United Nations forces north of the southern Lebanese Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aid . We do n't have much choice as long as the Soviets are involved . Israel can not face both the Soviets and the Arabs . But we should minimize this dependency so it wo n't become a burden on the U.S. or an insult to Israel itself . <P>
