What makes the interactive toys tick ? That is top-secret information these days . Manufacturers have shrouded their new toys in a haze of high-tech mystery , partly to preserve the sense of wonder about the devices , but also to prevent rivals from making knockoffs . While the technology is nothing that will tip the balance between superpowers , each toy company has developed a creative scheme for linking the toys with TV shows via light beams or audio signals . <P> Toy-industry experts believe that Mattel 's Captain Power toys are based on optical technology . The Captain Power show is apparently programmed with light patterns that can be received and decoded by the hand-held PowerJet and related toys . In a typical battle , villains on the TV show hurl fireballs and other menacing projectiles toward the screen , which signals youngsters and their weapons that it is time to fire back . When the child pulls the trigger promptly , the hand-held toy detects the successful hit and racks up points on a scoreboard that is displayed on the toy . If a player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy hits and suffer imaginative damage effects . Example : When a PowerJet " blows up , " it ejects its pilot onto the floor . <P> While Axlon is tight-lipped about its Tech Force robots , executives confirm that the toys are controlled by audio signals . Michael Hatcher , Axlon 's senior product manager , imitates the sound by muttering a low-pitched beeping noise . The Tech Force robots will carry microprocessors that decode the signals from the sound track of the Tech Force cartoon program . Those beeps  --  signifying such commands as forward , reverse , right and left  --  will send the robots wheeling across the living-room floor . At the same time , children can control other robots by sending out audio commands from a small keyboard . That way youngsters can stage battles between the robots they control and the ones commanded by the TV program . <P> Experts say the optical and audio signals are unlikely to cause any havoc with other electronic gear , automatic garage doors or pets with sensitive hearing . Though the technology is now being pitched to children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grownups . Saving the universe is one thing , but how about being able to take a potshot at J.R . Ewing on Dallas ?
