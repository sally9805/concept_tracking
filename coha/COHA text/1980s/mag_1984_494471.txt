How preferential treatment works against blacks . AFFIRMATIVE RACISM BY CHARLES MURRAY A FEW YEARS AGO , I got into an argument with a lawyer friend who is a partner in a New York firm , I was being the conservative , arguing that preferential treatment of blacks was immoral ; he was being the liberal , urging that it was the only way to bring blacks to full equality . In the middle of all this he abruptly said , " But you know , let 's face it . We must have hired at least ten blacks in the last few years , and none of them has really worked out . " He then returned to his case for still stronger affirmative action , while I wondered what it had been like for those ten blacks . And if he could make a remark like that so casually , what remarks would he be able to make some years down the road , if by that time it had been fifty blacks who had n't " really worked out " ? My friend 's comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take its place alongside the old . It grows out of preferential treatment for blacks , and it is Charles Murray is Senior Research Fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research and author of Losing Ground : American Social Policy 1950-1980 ( Basic Books ) . not just the much-publicized reactions , for example , of the white policemen or firemen who are passed over for promotion because of an affirmative action court order . The new racism that is potentially most damaging is located among the white elites ? educated , affluent , and occupy. ; ing the positions in education , business , and government from which this country is run . It currently focuses on blacks ; whether it will eventually extend to include Hispanics and other minorities remains to be seen . The new racists do not think blacks are inferior . They are typically longtime supporters of civil rights . But they exhibit the classic behavioral symptom of racism : they treat blacks differently from whites , because of their race . The results can be as concretely bad and unjust as any that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacks are refused an education they otherwise could have gotten . Sometimes blacks are shunted into dead-end jobs . Always , blacks are denied the right to compete as equals . The new racists also exhibit another characteristic of racism : they think about blacks differently from the way they think about whites . Their global view of blacks and civil rights is impeccable . Blacks must be enabled to achieve full equality . They are still unequal , through no fault of their own ( it is the fault of racism , it is the fault of inadequate opportunity , it is the legacy of history ) . But the new racists ' local view is that the blacks they run across professionally are not , on the average , up to the white standard . Among the new racists , lawyers have gotten used to the idea that the brief a black colleague turns in will be a little less well-rehearsed and argued than the one they would have done . Businessmen expect that a black colleague will not read a balance sheet as subtly as they do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the class . The new racists also tend to think of blacks as a commodity . The office must have a sufficient supply of blacks , who must be treated with special delicacy . The personnel problems this creates are more difficult than most because whites barely admit to themselves what 's going on . What follows is a foray into very poorly mapped territory . I will present a few numbers that explain much about how the process gets started . But the ways that the numbers get translated into behavior are even more important . The cases I present are composites constructed from my own observations and taken from firsthand accounts . All are based on real events and real people , stripped of their particularities . But the individual cases are not intended as evidence , because I can not tell you how often they happen . They have not been the kind of thing that social scientists or journalists have wanted to count . I am writing this because so many people , both white and black , to whom I tell such stories know immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem exists . How significant is it ? What follows is as much an attempt to elicit evidence as to present it . As in so many of the crusades of the 1960s , the nation began with a good idea . It was called " affirmative action , " initiated by Lyndon Johnson through Executive Order 11246 in September 1965 . It was an attractive label and a natural corrective to past racism : actively seek out black candidates for jobs , college , or promotions , without treating them differently in the actual decision to hire , admit , or promote . The term originally evoked both the letter and the spirit of the order . Then , gradually , affirmative action came to mean something quite different . In 1970 a federal court established the legitimacy of quotas as a means of implementing Johnson 's executive order . In 1971 the Supreme Court ruled that an employer could not use minimum credentials as a prerequisite for hiring if the credential acted as a " built-in headwind " for minority groups ? even when there was no discriminatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in form . " In 1972 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission acquired broad , independent enforcement powers . Thus by the early 1970s it had become generally recognized that a good-faith effort to recruit qualified blacks was not enough ? especially if one 's school depended on federal grants or one 's business depended on federal contracts . Even for businesses and schools not directly dependent on the government , the simplest way to withstand an accusation of violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was to make sure not that they had not just interviewed enough minority candidates , but that they had actually hired or admitted enough of them . Employers and admissions committees arrived at a rule of thumb : if the blacks who are available happen to be the best candidates , fine ; if not , the best available black candidates will be given some sort of edge in the selection process . Sometimes the edge will be small ; sometimes it will be predetermined that a black candidate is essential , and the edge will be very large . Perhaps the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college . Consider the cases of the following three students : John , William , and Carol , 17 years old and applying to college , are all equal on paper . Each has a score of 520 in the mathematics section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test , which puts them in the top third ? at the 67th percentile ? of all students who took the test . ( Figures are based on 1983 data . ) John is white . A score of 520 gets him into the state university . Against the advice of his high school counselor , he applies to a prestigious school , Ivy U. where his application is rejected in the first cut ? its average white applicant has math scores in the high 600s . William is black , from a middle-class family who sent him to good schools . His score of 520 puts him at the 95th percentile of all blacks who took the test . William 's high school counselor points out that he could probably get into Ivy U. William applies and is admitted ? Ivy U. uses separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is among the top blacks who applied . Carol is black , educated at an inner-city school , and her score of 520 represents an extraordinary achievement in the face of terrible schooling . An alumnus of Ivy U. who regularly looks for promising inner-city candidates finds her , recruits her , and sends her off with a full scholarship to Ivy U. HEN AMERICAN universities embarked on poli- cies of preferential admissions by race , they had the Carols in mind . They had good reason to be optimistic that preferential treatment would work ? for many years , the best universities had been weighting the test scores of applicants from small-town public schools when they were compared against those of applicants from the top private schools , and had been giving special breaks to students from distant states to ensure geographic distribution . The differences in preparation tended to even out after the first year or so . Blacks were being brought into a long-standing and successful tradition of preferential treatment . In the case of blacks , however , preferential treatment ran up against a large black-white gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This gap has been the hardest for whites to confront . But though it is not necessary or even plausible to believe that such differences are innate , it is necessary to recognize openly that the differences exist . By pretending they do n't , we begin the process whereby both the real differences and the racial factor are exaggerated . The black-white gap that applies most directly to this discussion is the one that separates blacks and whites who go to college . In 1983 , for example , the mean Scholastic Aptitude Test score for all blacks who took the examination was more than 100 points below the white score on both the verbal and the math sections . Statistically , it is an extremely wide gap . To convert the gap into more concrete terms , think of it this way : in 1983 , the same Scholastic Aptitude Test math score that put a black at the 50th percentile of all blacks who took the test put him at the 16th percentile of all whites who took the test . These results clearly mean we ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary education for blacks . But that does n't help much now , when an academic discrepancy of this magnitude is fed into a preferential admissions process . As universities scramble to make sure they are admitting enough blacks , the results feed the new racism . Here 's how it works : In 1983 , only 66 black students nationwide scored above 700 in the verbal section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test , and only 205 scored above 700 in the mathematics section . This handful of students can not begin to meet the demand for blacks with such scores . For example , Harvard , Yale , and Princeton have in recent years been bringing an aggregate of about 270 blacks into each entering class . If the black students entering these schools had the same distribution of scores as that of the freshman class as a whole , then every black student in the nation with a verbal score in the 700s , and roughly 70 percent of the ones with a math score in the 700s , would be in their freshman classes . The main problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black applicants , but that these same schools have much larger implicit quotas than they can fill with those applicants . They fill out the rest with the next students in line ? students who would not have gotten into these schools if they were not black , who otherwise would have been showing up in the classrooms of the nation 's less glamorous colleges and universities . But the size of the black pool does not expand appreciably at the next levels . The number of blacks scoring in the 600s on the math section in 1983 , for example , was 1,531 . Meanwhile , 31,704 nonblack students in 1983 scored in the 700s on the math section and 121,640 scored in the 600s . The prestige schools can not begin to absorb these numbers of other highly qualified freshmen , and they are perforce spread widely throughout the system . A SCHOOLS that draw most broadly from the student population , such as the large state universities , the effects of this skimming produce a situation that confirms the old racists in everything they want most to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies ( at the University of Colorado , for example , 6 percent of the freshmen in 1981 had math scores in the 700s and 28 percent had scores in the 600s ) , but the skimming process combined with the very small raw numbers means that almost none of them are black . What students and instructors see in their day-to-day experience in the classroom is a disproportionate number of blacks who are below the white average , relatively few blacks who are at the white average , and virtually none who are in the first rank . The image that the white student carries away is that blacks are less able than whites . I am not exalting the SAT as an infallible measure of academic ability , or pointing to test scores to try to convince anyone that blacks are performing below the level of whites . I am simply using them to explain what instructors and students already notice , and talk about , among themselves . They do not talk openly about such matters . One characteristic of the new racism is that whites deny in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in black and white academic performance . Another is that they dismiss the importance of tests when black scores are at issue , blaming cultural bias and saying that test scores are not good predictors of college performance . At the same time , they watch anxiously over their own children 's test scores . The differences in academic performance do not disappear by the end of college . Far from narrowing , the gap separating black and white academic achievement appears to get larger . Various studies , most recently at Harvard , have found that during the 1970s blacks did worse in college ( as measured by grade point average ) than their test scores would have predicted . Moreover , the black-white gap in the Graduate Record Examination is larger than the gap in the Scholastic Aptitude Test . The gap between black and white freshmen is a bit less than one standard deviation ( the technical measure for comparing scores ) . Black and white seniors who take the Graduate Record Examination reveal a gap of about one and a quarter standard deviations . Why should the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , perhaps a disproportionate number of the best black students never take the examination . But there are also reasons for suspecting that in fact blacks get a worse education in college than whites do . Here are a few of the hypotheses that deserve full exploration . Fr AKE THE SITUATION of William ? a slightly above- ' average student who , because he is black , gets into a highly competitive school . William studies very hard during the first year . He nonetheless gets mediocre grades . He has a choice . He can continue to study hard and continue to get mediocre grades , and be seen by his classmates as a black who can not do very well . Or he can explicitly refuse to engage in the academic game . He decides to opt out , and his performance gets worse as time goes on . He emerges from college with a poor education and is further behind the whites than he was as a freshman . If large numbers of other black students at the institution are in the same situation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete academically . ( At Harvard , it is said , the current term among black students for a black who studies like a white is " incognegro . " ) The response is not hard to understand . If one subpopulation of students is conspicuously behind another population and is visibly identifiable , then the population that is behind must come up with a good excuse for doing poorly . " Not wanting to do better " is as good as any . But there is another crucial reason why blacks might not close the gap with whites during college : they are not taught as well as whites are . Racist teachers impeding the progress of students ? Perhaps , but most college faculty members I know tend to bend over backward to be " fair " to black students ? and that may be the problem . I suggest that inferior instruction is more likely to be a manifestation of the new racism than the old . Consider the case of Carol , with outstanding abilities but deprived of decent prior schooling : she struggles the first year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the aftereffects of her inferior preparation . Her instructors diplomatically point out the more flagrant mistakes , but they ignore minor lapses , and never push her in the aggressive way they push white students who have her intellectual capacity . Some of them are being patronizing ( she is doing quite well , considering ) . Others are being prudent : teachers who criticize black students can find themselves being called racists in the classroom , in the campus newspaper , or in complaints to the administration . The same process continues in graduate school . Indeed , because there are even fewer blacks in graduate schools than in undergraduate schools , the pressures to get black students through to the degree , no matter what , can be still greater . But apart from differences in preparation and ability that have accumulated by the end of schooling , the process whereby we foster the appearance of black inferiority continues . Let 's assume that William did not give up during college . He goes to business school , where he gets his Masters degree . He signs up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons in his class , and William is ranked near the middle . But of the 5 blacks in his class , he ranks first ( remember that he was at the 95th percentile of blacks taking the Scholastic Aptitude Test ) . He is hired on his first interview by his first-choice company , which also attracted the very best of the white students . He is hired alongside 5 of the top-ranking white members of the class . William 's situation as one of 5 blacks in a class of 100 illustrates the proportions that prevail in business schools , and business schools are by no means one of the more extreme examples . The pool of black candidates for any given profession is a small fraction of the white pool . This works out to a 20-to-1 edge in business ; it is even greater in most of the other professions . The result , when many hiring institutions are competing , is that a major gap between the abilities of new black and white employees in any given workplace is highly likely . Everyone needs to hire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black " confers in the hiring decision warps the sequence of hiring in such a way that a scarce resource ( the blacks with a given set of qualifications ) is exhausted at an artificially high rate , producing a widening gap in comparison with the remaining whites from which an employer can choose . The more aggressively affirmative action is enforced , the greater the imbalance . In general , the first companies to hire can pursue strategies that minimize or even eliminate the difference in ability between the new black and white employees . IBM and Park Avenue law firms can do very well , just as Harvard does quite well in attracting the top black students . But the more effectively they pursue these strategies , the more quickly they strip the population of the best black candidates . FTI O THIS POINT I have been discussing problems that are more or less driven by realities we have very little hope of manipulating in the short term except by discard-ing the laws regarding preferential treatment . People do differ in acquired abilities . Currently , acquired abilities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and firms do form a rough hierarchy when they draw from these distributions . The results follow ineluctably . The dangers they represent are not a matter of statistical probabilities , but of day-to-day human reactions we see around us . The damage caused by these mechanistic forces should be much less in the world of work than in the schools , however . Schools deal in a relatively narrow domain of skills , and " talent " tends to be assigned specific meanings and specific measures . Workplaces deal in highly complex sets of skills , and " talent " consists of all sorts of combinations of qualities . A successful career depends in large part upon finding jobs that elicit and develop one 's strengths . At this point the young black professional must sidestep a new series of traps laid by whites who need to be ostentatiously nonracist . Let 's say that William goes to work for the XYZ Corporation , where he is assigned with another management trainee ( white ) to a department where much of the time is spent preparing proposals for government contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ? proofreading drafts , calculating the costs of minor items in the bid , making photocopies , taking notes at conferences . William gets more dignified work . He is assigned portions of the draft to write ( which are later rewritten by more experienced staff ) , sits in on planning sessions , and even goes to Washington as a highly visible part of the team to present the bid . As time goes on , the white trainee learns a great deal about how the company operates , and is seen as a go-getting young member of the team . William is perceived to be a bright enough fellow , but not much of a detail man and not really much of a self-starter . E VEN IF a black is hired under terms that put him on a par with his white peers , the subtler forms of differential treatment work against him . Particularly for any corporation that does business with the government , the new employee has a specific , immediate value purely because he is black . There are a variety of requirements to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black face is helpful . These have very little to do with the long-term career interests of the new employee ; on the contrary , they often lead to a dead end as head of the minority-relations section of the personnel department . Added to this is another problem that has nothing to do with the government . When the old racism was at fault ( as it often still is ) , the newly hired black employee was excluded from the socialization process because the whites did not want him to become part of the group . When the new racism is at fault , it is because many whites are embarrassed to treat black employees as badly as they are willing to treat whites . Hence another reason that whites get on-the-job training that blacks do not : much of the early training of an employee is intertwined with menial assignments and mild hazing . Blacks who are put through these routines often see themselves as racially abused ( and when a black is involved , old-racist responses may well have crept in ) . But even if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are afraid that he is , and so protect him from it . There are many variations , all having the same effect : the black is denied an apprenticeship that the white has no way of escaping . Without serving the ap ? prenticeship , there is no way of becoming part of the team . C AROL SUFFERS a slightly different fate . She and a white woman are hired as reporters by a major news . paper . They both work hard , but after a few months there is no denying it : neither one of them can write . The white woman is let go . Carol is kept on , because the paper can not afford to have any fewer blacks than it already has She is kept busy with reportorial work , even though they have to work around the writing problem . She is told nol to worry ? there 's lots more to being a journalist than writing . It is the mascot syndrome . A white performing at a comparable level would be fired . The black is kept on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opportunity Commission ( it can be very expensive to fire a black ) , perhaps out of a more diffuse wish not to appear discriminatory . Everybody pretends that nothing is wrong ? but the black 's career is at a dead end . The irony , of course , is that the white who gets fired and has to try something else has been forced into accepting a chance of making a success in some other line of work whereas the black is seduced into not taking the same chance . Sometimes differential treatment takes an even more pernicious form : the conspiracy to promote a problem out of existence . As part of keeping Carol busy , the newspaper gives her some administrative responsibilities . They do not amount to much . But she has an impressive title on a prominent newspaper and she is black ? a potent combination . She gets an offer from a lesser paper in another part of the country to take a senior editorial post . Het current employer is happy to be rid of an awkward situation and sends along glowing references @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle ? only this time , she is in a highly visible position , and within a few weeks the deficiencies that were covered up at the old job have become the subject of jokes all over the office . Most of the jokes are openly racist . It is important to pause and remember who Carol is : an extremely bright young woman , not ( in other circumstances ) a likely object of condescension . But being brighi is no protection . Whites can usually count on the market to help us recognize egregious career mistakes and to prevent us from being promoted too far from a career line that fits our strengths , and too far above our level of readiness . One of the most prevalent characteristics of white differential treatment of blacks has been to exempt blacks from these market considerations , substituting for them a market premium attached to race . The most obvious consequence of preferential treatment is that every black professional , no matter how able , is tainted . Every black who is hired by a white-run organization that hires blacks preferentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his co-workers believe he was hired because of his race ; and he has to put up with the suspicion in his own mind that they might be right . Whites are curiously reluctant to consider this a real problem ? it is an abstraction , I am told , much less important than the problem that blacks face in getting a job in the first place . But black professionals talk about it , and they tell stories of mental breakdowns ; of people who had to leave the job altogether ; of long-term professional paralysis . What white would want to be put in such a situation ? Of course it would be a constant humiliation to be resented by some of your co-workers and condescended to by others . Of course it would affect your perceptions of yourself and your self-confidence . No system that produces such side effects ? as preferential treatment must do can be defended unless it is producing some extremely important benefits . A ND THAT BRINGS us to the decisive question . If the alternative were no job at all , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentment and condescension are part of the price of getting blacks into the positions they deserve . But is that the alternative today ? If the institutions of this country were left to their own devices now , to what extent would they refuse to admit , hire , and promote people because they were black ? To what extent are American institutions kept from being racist by the government 's intervention ? It is another one of those questions that are seldom investigated aggressively , and I have no evidence . Let me suggest a hypothesis that bears looking into that the signal event in the struggle for black equality during the last thirty years , the one with real impact , was not the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or Executive Order 11246 or any other governmental act . It was the civil rights movement itself . It raised to a pitch of acute and lasting discomfort the racial consciousness of the generations of white Americans who are now running the country . 1 will not argue that the old racism is dead at any level of society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation or in the typical admissions office , there is an abiding desire to be not-racist . This need not be construed as brotherly love . Guilt will do as well . But the civil rights movement did its job . I suggest that the laws and the court decisions and the continuing intellectual respectability behind preferential treatment are not holding many doors open to qualified blacks that would otherwise be closed . Suppose for a moment that I am right . Suppose that , for practical purposes , racism would not get in the way of blacks if preferential treatment were abandoned . How , in my most optimistic view , would the world look different ? There would be fewer blacks at Harvard and Yale ; but they would all be fully competitive with the whites who were there . White students at the state university would encounter a cross-section of blacks who span the full range of ability , including the top levels , just as whites do . College remedial courses would no longer be disproportionately black . Whites rejected by the school they wanted would quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted in their place . Blacks in bigcorporations would no longer be shunted off to personnel-relations positions , but would be left on the main-line tracks toward becoming comptrollers and sales managers and chief executive officers . Whites would quit assuming that black colleagues had been hired because they were black . Blacks would quit worrying that they had been hired because they were black . Would blacks still lag behind ? As a population , yes , for a time , and the nation should be mounting a far more effective program to improve elementary and secondary education for blacks than it has mounted in the last few decades . But in years past virtually every ethnic group in America has at one time or another lagged behind as a population , and has eventually caught up . In the process of catching up , the ones who breached the barriers were evidence of the success of that group . Now blacks who breach the barriers tend to he seen as evidence of the inferiority of that group . N D THAT IS the evil of preferential treatment . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blacks who come in contact with each other so as to maximize the likelihood that whites have the advantage in experience and ability . The system then encourages both whites and blacks to behave in ways that create self-fulfilling prophecies even when no real differences exist . It is here that the new racism links up with the old . The old racism has always openly held that blacks are permanently less competent than whites . The new racism tacitly accepts that , in the course of overcoming the legacy of the old racism , blacks are temporarily less competent than whites . It is an extremely fine distinction . As time goes on , fine distinctions tend to be lost . Preferential treatment is providing persuasive evidence for the old racists , and we can already hear it sotto voce : " We gave you your chance , we let you educate them and push them into jobs they could n't have gotten on their own and coddle them every way you could . And see ; they still are n't as good as whites , and you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this message is going to be heard by a white elite that needs to excuse its failure to achieve black equality . The only happy aspect of the new racism is that the corrective ? to get rid of the policies encouraging preferential treatment ? is so natural . Deliberate preferential treatment by race has sat as uneasily with America 's equal-opportunity ideal during the post-1965 period as it did during the days of legalized segregation . We had to construct tortuous rationalizations when we permitted blacks to be kept on the back of the bus ? and the rationalizations to justify sending blacks to the head of the line have been just as tortuous . Both kinds of rationalization say that sometimes it is all right to treat people of different races in different ways . For years , we have instinctively sensed this was wrong in principle but intellectualized our support for it as an expedient . I submit that our instincts were right . There is no such thing as good racial discrimination . ?              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
