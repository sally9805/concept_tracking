Now parishioners are starting to emulate patients <P> In simpler times , most Christians felt bound by St. Paul 's admonition ( in I Corinthians 6 ) to " suffer yourselves to be defrauded " rather than take a fellow church member to court . That dictum has long been widely ignored . Now , litigious Americans are going even one step further : they are starting to sue the collars off their pastors for malpractice . <P> Consider the case of the Rev. DeWitt Hill , who preaches a puritanical life-style in his pentecostal church in Little Rock , Ark . A woman in his church was married to a Baptist who , says Hill , " liked to go nightclubbing and go to the dog races . " When his wife divorced him , he sued the Rev. Hill for $1 million , on grounds of " alienation of affections through teaching of the Bible , " also claiming that he does not go to nightclubs or bet on dog races .

His Roman Catholic parents sued , charging that the clergy " discouraged and prevented " their son from seeking professional psychological counseling . MacArthur attempted to get the case dismissed , claiming that the suit violated constitutional freedom of religion , as well as the confidentiality between a confessant and his priest . The court rejected his argument . Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> In response to such challenges , insurance companies have begun to sell malpractice protection policies to churches . The result may be baneful , especially for clergy most active in helping deeply troubled people . Just as medical doctors have grown leary of dealing with accident victims in certain circumstances , clergymen are likely to begin worrying about the legal risk of bringing spiritual succor . Says the Rev. Clifford Riis of Charleston , S.C. : " You hear about people collecting fortunes for almost any complaint . I began thinking about the possibility that I might be sued and I became cautious , especially with the people who came in off the street . I 'll tell you , that does n't make you feel very easy in conversation with people .
