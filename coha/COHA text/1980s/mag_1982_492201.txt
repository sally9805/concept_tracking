DOES L-LYSINE STOP HERPES ? Last Sunday our minister quoted a noted Catholic theologian and sociologist , who , in addressing his colleagues , said , " You are losing your young people from the church because you tell them that promiscuous and premarital sex is not moral . You should be telling them that it is n't ' smart . ' " It is true that married participants in the " sexual revolution " are now discovering that Moses , in all his wisdom , may have had a very good health reason for enforcing the Ten Commandments , including " Thou shalt not commit adultery . " The herpes virus is believed to have been around for thousands of years . The Greeks named it herpes , meaning " to creep . " Tiberius Caesar is said to have tried to eliminate it from his land by putting a ban on kissing  --  manifestly half a measure ! Genital herpes is spread when one sexual partner is having an active outbreak . If one case comes to town , the whole town could catch it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is an estimated pool of more than five million genital-herpes sufferers in the U.S. , with 500,000 new cases expected this year , many young people are returning to more conservative social behavior . On campuses where the disease has reached epidemic proportions , students are heeding the ominous results of promiscuous sex . " There will be more interest in having fewer and deeper relationships , " predicted one herpes victim to the New York Times . " This promiscuity thing is just too unhealthy , both physically and emo tionally . This patient is now placing more value on the " quality of commitment " and less on the " quantity of sex . " He feels that American society is moving in the same direction . What are the ravages of herpes simplex II that have caused such a change in the attitudes of the young people toward the sexual revolution ? ? For starters , the shedding of the virus through the birth canal of infected women causes fatal or profoundly damaging meningoencephalitis in the newborn . Where a mother has an outbreak less than two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect the baby . It is estimated about 1,000 babies a year are born with herpes , probably because their mothers were not aware of their infections before delivery . The virus spreads quickly through the infants ' systems , killing more than half of them and leaving most of the re mainder permanently brain damaged . ? Secondly , this organism is thought to cause a fivefold to eightfold increase in cervical cancer in infected women . Doctors recommend that women with herpes get pap smears twice a year . ? Finally , since telltale blisters may reveal one partner 's infidelity , the virus can cause emotional strain in a marriage , and even divorce . Genital herpes is sexually transmitted , but not all herpes viruses are of the " below-thewaist " variety . Herpes simplex I causes the well-known painful fever blister , and a third kind of infection is caused by the varicellazoster variety , which produces , on one hand , chicken pox in children and , on the other hand , herpes zoster , the notorious and painful shingles in adults . So much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While I was investigating the herpes epidemic , a letter to the editor providentially came across my desk . It was from Mrs. Margaret Stewart of Escondido , California . She wrote : " Dear Dr. SerVaas : " This will probably be one of many letters you have received regarding your article in the April issue of The Saturday Evening Post describing Mary Kay Ashe 's bout with shingles . I hope my experience with shingles will be a help to others so afflicted . " Some months ago , on Sunday evening while undressing for bed , I noticed a cluster of red spots just below my left arm , and , luckily for me , I had an appointment with my doctor the next morning . He took one look and told me I had a case of herpes zoster ! shingles . ) I asked if he could help me , so he explained what caused them in the first place . He said I lacked a sufficient amount of one of the amino acids  --  namely lysine . He told me to take one tablet after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire bottle of lysine  --  although the slight pain and discomfort only lasted less than a week . By the way , the spots did n't spread and soon were healed . " You told of Mary Kay 's doctor giving shots of interferon , which is expensive . My bottle of lysine cost less than $3 ! " ? Margaret M. Stewart We called Mrs. Stewart to see if her herpes zoster was still quiescent . It was . By now , I was sufficiently curious to check this out with our family dermatologist , Dr. Arthur Norins , who was once my professor and now heads the dermatology department at the Indiana University School of Medicine . He is a conservation , cautious and reserved professional with impeccable credentials . Can you imagine my surprise and delight when he told me that he , with two colleagues , had published a research paper on the effect of lysine on herpes . His office being a stone 's throw from my own , I had his paper within minutes . Reporting in Dermatologia , researchers Drs . Norins , Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 45 patients with facial , oral and genital herpes . Dr. Griffith , a Lilly researcher , was a font of good information about lysine and herpes . He told me there are a number of papers being withheld from the lay press until they are published in professional journals , and I could read some excitement between the lines . Dr. Griffith said , " Lysine is a food substance and an over-the-counter item  --  what we call a therapeutic orphan because no drug house can afford to take it on as a research project , since they could n't compete with the presContinued on page 92 ent packagers of the low-cost item . " Herpes is an insidious and Wiley virus that hides in the nerve cells and emerges when the body 's defenses are down . But it does have one known weakness  --  it ca n't replicate without an amino acid called arginine . Dr. Christopher Kagan had learned that the herpes virus grows very well in a test tube when it is supplied with arginine . Conversely , lysine inhibits the growth of the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kagan that lysine might be used to control herpes in people . In the first tests on herpes patients it was found that fairly low doses of lysine added to the daily diet ( 312 mg. to 1,200 mg. ) suppressed recurrence of and speeded up recovery from genital-herpes infection . Soon after that , Dr. Richard Griffith noticed that herpes infections increased at Easter and Christmas . He also realized that chocolate has twice as much arginine as lysine . It appears that a lot of arginine in the diet could help bring on an attack . Dr. Kagan said that some people are so sensitive to extra arginine in their diet that a few nuts added to a salad can trigger an attack . Some nuts have many times as much arginine as lysine , so this is understandable . Dr. Griffith and his dermatologist colleagues began finding that people who eat a lot of arginine-rich foods ( seeds , nuts and chocolate ) need more lysine to control their herpes than people who use more milk and other lysine-rich foods . The physicians scattered throughout the country who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results . Most of them use 1,500 to 3,000 mg. of L-lysine supplement a day ( in three doses ) . To prevent recurrences , they sometimes use as little as 500 mg. of lysine per day . In addition , all of the physicians with whom we spoke insisted that decreasing the intake of arginine was equally important in creating a bad environment for the herpes virus . I asked Dr. Griffith , " What about pregnant women ? Can they take lysine without danger to the fetus ? " I asked him if he was worried about side effects with lysine and pregnant women . " No , " he said , laughing , " except for one very pertinent side effect that I encountered in one of my patients . " He told of his daughter , who repeatedly had facial herpes . " In high school , she was plagued with ' zitlike ' breakouts that occurred in stress , and we had used all sorts of treatments in her case . And then lysine came along , and that was my first case . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chin again . So she is still taking it almost continually , and the side effect she had was that her last child turned out to be twins . So , " he said , amused , " I have to caution people about taking lysine during pregnancy because they might wind up having twins . " . Dr. Griffith , who has worked with herpes since 1974 , said he and his colleagues have screened several hundred patients and have found that lysine prevents recurrence of genital as well as oral herpes . " In fact , " he explained , think it works better on genital than on labial . It is hard to evaluate , because usually the genital herpes is more extensive than the facial herpes . The blisters seem to stop , and pain stops almost immediately , as compared to the facial ; but there again , it may be the relationship to the sensitivity to pain in the area around the lip , which is a fairly sensitive area . " Dr. Griffith said the relief of pain is the thing that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing they remark about is that they forgot they had the lesion in a matter of hours . The pain is gone . When we treat infectious mono and shingles with lysine , dramatic results are shown , " he continued . " Infectious mono has been treated so dramatically with lysine , it is sad that the treatment has n't been used throughout the country . " Many people with whom Dr. Griffith spoke exclaimed that lysine relieved their pain almost overnight . " The doctor of the last patient that I had with shingles , " Dr. Griffith explained , " had him on Tylenol with codeine , aspirin and a sedative at night , and he was losing sleep . He stated he would sleep 15 or 20 minutes and that the pain would wake him up . He went two or three nights like that . One of his relatives had heard about the work we had been doing , so he called and asked about it , and I told him to pick up some lysine . ' It ca n't hurt you , ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Well , he called back the next day and said that he had had about three hours sleep that night , which was more than he had had for a long time . The following day he called me and reported that he had slept all night . I told him to try stopping his other pain-killing medicines and see how he got along , and he said he dropped his medications , had no more pain and had a full-night 's sleep . " Dr. Griffith stressed that the arginine intake must be decreased when lysine is ingested , because arginine enhances the growth of the herpes virus . But he explained that it is easy to restrict arginine by not eating chocolate , nuts , peanut butter , jello and other higharginine-containing foods . " We do n't usually restrict the cereals . We start in with nuts and chocolate , " said Dr. Griffith . " Then , when we run into individuals who , with that restriction and while using large amounts of lysine ( 4 to 6 grams per day ) , still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cereals . Corn is the worst because it has little or no lysine . " " Your patient teaches you things , " said Dr. Griffith . " I had a fellow at Walter Reed whose wife had been plagued with herpes on the right arm and shoulder . When we got her dosage of lysine worked out and her diet restricted , she improved remarkably , except when she would have some stressful situation , and it would break through again . She was markedly improved , but not completely free of it , and her husband was the sort of individual who did his research . He went down to the Walter Reed Library and started looking up the foods that have arginine and lysine in them . I had not been able to get information about the amount of arginine in a lot of foods because arginine is not an essential amino acid . It is not studied like the essential ones . He informed me that jello has arginine in it . And I said , it might have , but it is mostly water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' You have n't done your homework . ' He was a colonel in the military , and so he said , ' You look it up . ' So I did and found that it comes from a collagen that is high in arginine . His wife was cooking a cardiac diet for him , and one of the things on the diet was jello ; she was eating one-quarter of a package of jello every time she made his diet . So they dropped that out , and the lesions all disappeared . He called me and said , ' I told you so . ' So you learn a lot from your patients . " Dr. Griffith then told me about the day Dr. Kagan first came from California to Indianapolis to talk about working on lysine . " Dr. Kagan had run across a case of ideopathic steatorrhea ( chronic diarrhea ) . He was required to take pictures in radiology . This man had had it some 30-odd years , Dr. Kagan said , and he had herpes around the mouth . He was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' I 'm not sure that I can get it down because of the soreness in my mouth . ' He got it down , and Dr. Kagan said , ' When you are through here , go out and buy some lysine and get rid of that herpes . ' The fellow came back in about a week or so , walking on air . He said , ' You will not believe this , but my steatorrhea has completely disappeared , and I have gained five pounds . ' I do n't know if it was the elimination of the steatorrhea or the elimination of the herpes that allowed him to eat , but this was the reason Dr. Kagan called me to see about beginning a research project . " I then called Dr. Kagan , who is now a radiologist in California and whose work had appeared in Dermatologia . He told me that they were testing lysine on viruses with DNA structures similar to genital herpes , such as chicken pox , mononucleosis and other conditions , and that the results with mono had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't published that yet because we do n't have enough data ; but it would appear that this is probably not specific only to herpes simplex but may have a wider application once we get more data . " Dr. Kagan reported one case of a fellow who had such a bad case of herpes zoster that the dermatologist threw up his hands , saying , " You have to stay in bed for three weeks . " And three to five days later , on high doses of lysine , it cleared up . That was eight grams a day  --  given three or four times a day . " I did n't manage him , but I do hear about cases all the time with severe zoster clearing up . " Since Dr. Norins , as chairman of the dermatology department of a large medical school , has seen and treated many patients since 1974 , when Dr. Kagan first visited his department , I asked him if he could give me a rough estimate of the percentage of his successes . " I believe 90 percent would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten percent , people who were having the most severe problems , had not been helped . " Because he sees referrals from around the state , his traffic in severe cases is , of course , quite heavy . Since lysine is an amino acid found in many foods , I then asked him if he saw any problem in people getting it in powder form instead of pills . They could then , if they preferred , simply add it to their recipes to supplement the lysine content of low-lysine or high-arginine dishes . Dr. Norins said he saw no reason why this could n't be done . In other words , the exact milligrams were not so strategic , since one could consume , give or take , 2,000 mg. of lysine by drinking a few glasses of milk and eating a generous serving of fish . All of the physicians who have shown success with lysine have been disappointed that no good research projects have been funded . Most of the failures came when the patients did not use an adequate amount of lysine . They felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a preparation of lysine instead of L-lysine . They would then be getting a less-potent mixture of L-lysine and D-lysine ; D-lysine is ineffective against herpes . " The sad part about it from my point of view is that lysine is a safe substance , " said Dr. Kagan . " It is just an amino acid . It is not going to hurt anybody . And the in vitro ( test tube ) work is dramatic . The first work was done in 1950 , showing that it is effective . The in vitro work in the biochemical and basic science literature went on through the ' 50s and ' 60s , and there 's all this data and 30 or 40 papers sl- .. ' owing that herpes is inhibited by lysine and that arginine stimulates it . They broke it down with electrophoresis , and they figured out what proteins in the virus are affected and at what points ; they know exactly which proteins are involved , the time sequence and where in the sequence the lysine works . It 's all known , and nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because I read all of these papers . " One reason why L-lysine is slow to be accepted , if you think about it , " Dr. Kagan added , " is because an orally effective antiviral agent has not been heard of before . And here is one right in front of our noses . It takes a change in one 's thought patterns even to begin to accept it . " Dr. Barbara North , who reported success in treating various kinds of herpes with lysine and the low-arginine diet , prepared the chart on page 29 , and she obtained permission for us to interview one of her genital-herpes patients who had gone on lysine about six months ago . The patient was glad to share her experience , which follows : " I contracted genital herpes ten years ago when I was very young-16 and in love . I was treated at first with silver nitrate , gamma globulin , smallpox vaccine , soda baths and many things , without success . In the years that followed , I had other attacks , about every four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do at the time , and he was actually studying it because it was a new epidemic . Nothing helped . It was really painful , and the attacks began coming every month . I became depressed . The experience is probably a little bit like cancer but to a lesser degree , because you experience such a feeling of helplessness when you think you 've finally gotten over it and then another flare-up would come back . It was a feeling that herpes had me  --  that I could n't control it . It was upset-ting to have to share with someone that you have venereal disease . Once into an attack you ca n't let a lover get near you . The stress of always wanting to avoid having an attack , to feel stressful about having an attack , can bring on more attacks . " When I started taking lysine , I started taking the wrong kind . I took plain lysine instead of L-lysine . And it did n't work . It was n't as effective , and I was n't having any change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would help , it was n't creating any improvement . And the minute I started on L-lysine and gave myself a couple weeks , I noticed a definite difference . No longer did my herpes have to break the skin . It really , really did help . So I know it 's not just a placebo . There 's a definite connection . I do n't think it stops the attacks all the time , but 1 definitely think it diminishes the pain and the length of the attack . Lysine gives you control . You feel you can do something about your herpes . I feel sorry that there are many older people who have suffered with herpes for a very long time who are n't being told about lysine , " she concluded . It appears that research funds for the purpose of studying homely , ordinary substances , such as lysine , are in short supply from major pharmaceutical houses . They argue , with some justice , that they must devote considerable attention to the unrewarding public service of providing drugs for rare diseases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cost of producing such rare therapies for a very small number of cases , the major houses feel justified in leaving the differential study and provision of ordinary substances , such as lysine , to ordinary suppliers . Getting the word out about lysine , when there is no budget in pharmaceutical companies to send salesmen around the country or to call doctors or to attend medical conventions , is the real challenge . There is no budget available to set up large grants that could be given to pharmacology departments in medical schools with which to set up experiments . Who will champion the cause ? Who will set up good , double-blind studies to test lysine ? When Benjamin Franklin was faced with a similar problem in the colonies , he used his publication and the U.S. Post Office  --  which he also founded ? to spread the word that smallpox vaccine , made from cow serum , was safe to use . He got input from the rural colonists and printed their observations . The Post should do no less . If herpes sufferers will answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we will conduct an epidemiological study that may informally advance our knowledge while we wait for objective , controlled research which would cause more physicians to try lysine .
