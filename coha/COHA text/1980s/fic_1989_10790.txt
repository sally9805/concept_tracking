Higgins Clark ' While My Pretty One Sleepsspend a dime without Toohey asking him what he was living on , so he worked and hated every minute of it . He rented a dingy room in a fleabag on First Avenue and One Hundred and Fifth Street . What the parole officerdid n't know was that most of Denny 's time away from the job was spent panhandling on the street . He changed both the locations and his disguises every few days . Sometimes he 'd dress like a bum , put on filthy clothes and shabby sneakers , smear dirt on his face and hair . He 'd prop up against a building and hold a torn piece ofcardboard which read , " HELP , I 'M HUNGRY . " That was one of the better sucker baits . Other times he 'd put on faded khakis and a gray wig . He 'd wear dark glasses , carry a cane , pin a sign to his coat , " HOMELESS VET . " At his feet a bowl quickly filled with quarters and dimes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Nothing like the thrill of planning a real job , but it was something to keep his hand in . Only once or twice , when he 'd come across a wino with a few bucks , had he succumbedto the need to waste someone . But the cops did n't give a damn when a wino or a bum was beaten or stabbed , so it was practically risk-free . His probation would be finished in three months , then he 'd be able to drop out of sight and decide where the best action was to be found . Even the parole officer was relaxing . On Saturday morning , Toohey phoned him at the deli . Denny could just picture Mike , his puny frame hunched over the desk in his sloppy office . " I 've been talking to your boss , Denny . He tells me you 're one of his most dependable workers . " " Thank you , sir . " If Denny had been standing in frontof Toohey 's desk he would have twisted his hands in an attitude of nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and manipulated his narrow lips to an eager grin . Instead he silently mouthed an obscenityinto the phone . " Denny , you can skip reporting to me on Monday . I 've got a heavy schedule and you 're one of the men I know I can trust . I 'll see you next week . " " Yes , sir . " Denny hung up the phone . A caricature of a smile slashed creases below his prominent cheekbones . Half of his thirty-seven years had been spent in custody , beginning with his first break-in when he was twelve . A permanent grayish prison pallor was ground into his skin . He glanced around the deli , at the sickeningly cute icecreamtables and wire chairs , the white Formica counter , the luncheon-special signs , the well-dressed regulars deep in their newspapers over French toast or corn flakes . He was interrupted in his dream of what he 'd like to do to this place and to Mike Toohey , by the manager shouting , " Hey , Adler , get it moving ! Those orders wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Countdown on yes sir ! Denny thought , as he grabbed his jacket and the carton of paper bags . When he got back to the deli , the manager was just answering the phone . He looked at Denny with his usual sour expression . " I told you no personal calls during business hours . " He slammed the receiver into Denny 's hand . The only one who ever called him here was Mike Toohey . Denny snarled his name and heard a muffled " Hello , Denny . " He recognized the voice immediately . BigMary Higgins ClarkCharley Santino . Ten years ago Denny had shared a cell in Attica with Big Charley , and from time to time he had done a couple of jobs for him . He knew that Charley had important mob connections . Denny ignored the " Get on with it " expression on the manager 's face . There were only a couple of people at the counter now . The tables were empty . He had the pleasurableglow of knowing that whatever Charley wanted would be interesting . Automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speaker . " Yeah ? " " Tomorrow . Eleven o'clock .

Over the snowy weekend , Seamus Lambston huddled alone in the family apartment on Seventy-first Street and West End Avenue . On Friday afternoon , he called his bartender . " I 'm sick . Get Matty to fill in till Monday . " He 'd slept soundly Friday night , the sleep of the emotionally spent , but he woke up on Saturday with a sense of ultimatedread . Ruth had driven up to Boston on Thursday and stayed until Sunday . Jeannie , their youngest daughter , was a freshman at the University of Massachusetts . The check Seamus sent for spring semester had bounced . Ruth had gotten an emergency loan from her office and rushed up with the replacement . After Jeannie 's distraught call , they 'd had a row that must have been heard five blocks away . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he 'd shouted . 42While My Pretty One Sleeps " Business is lousy . With three kids in college , is it my fault we 're scraping the bottom of the barrel ? Do you think I can pull money out of the thin air ? " They 'd confronted each other , frightened , exhausted , hopeless . He 'd been shamed by the look of distaste in her eyes . He knew he had n't aged well . Sixty-two years old . He 'd built up his five-foot-ten frame with sit-ups and barbells . But now he had a potbelly that would n't go away , his once thick sandy hair was thinning and dirty yellow , his reading glasses accentuated the puffiness of his face . He sometimes looked in the mirror , then at the picture of Ruth and himself on their wedding day . Both in handsomesuits , both pushing forty , second marriages for both of them , happy , eager for each other . The bar had been going great , and even though he 'd mortgaged the hell out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recoup in a couple of years . Ruth 's quiet , tidy ways were like sanctuaryafter putting up with Ethel . " Peace is worth every nickel it will cost , " he 'd told the lawyer who did n't want him to agree to lifetime alimony . He 'd been delighted when Marcy was born . UnexpectedlyLinda had followed two years later . They 'd been shocked when Jeannie came along as he and Ruth were turning forty-five . Ruth 's slender body had grown stocky . As the rent for the bar doubled and tripled and the old customers moved away , her serene face had taken on a look of perpetual worry . She wanted so much to give things to the girls , things they could n't afford . Frequently he snapped at her , " Why not give them a happy home instead of a lot of junk ? " These last years with the college expenses had been43Mary Higgins Clarkexcruciating . There just was n't enough money .

" Tell the judge you ca n't afford to educate your children and that parasite is making a fortune . She does n't need your money . She 's got more than she can spend . " The latest outburst , last week , had been the worst . Ruth read in the Post that Ethel had just signed a book contract for a half-million-dollar advance . Ethel was quoted as saying the tell-all book would be a " stick of dynamite thrown into the fashion world . " For Ruth that was the last straw . That and the bounced check . " You go see that , that . . . " Ruth never swore . But the unspoken word might have been shouted . " You tell her that I 'm going to go to the columnists and tell them she 's bleeding you dry .

Do n't you think her fancy magazines might take exception to one of their feminist editors blackmailing her ex-hus-band ? " " It 's not blackmail . It 's alimony . " Seamus had tried to sound reasonable . " But yes , I 'll see her . " Ruth was due back late Sunday afternoon . At noon on Sunday , Seamus stirred himself from his lethargy and began to clean the apartment . They 'd given up the oncea-weekcleaning woman two years ago . Now they sharedWhile My Pretty One Sleepsthe chores , with Ruth 's complaints a running part of the process . " Just what I need after being crushed on the Seventh Avenue subway to spend weekends pushing a vacuum . " Last week she 'd suddenly burst into tears . " I 'm so damn tired . " At four o'clock the apartment was in decent shape . It needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The building had gone co-op , but they had n't been able to afford to buy the place . Twenty years and nothing to show for it but rent receipts . Seamus laid out cheese and wine on the cocktail table in the living room . The furniture was faded and shabby , but in the soft light of the late afternoon it did n't look bad . In three years more Jeannie would be finished school . Marcy was a senior this year . Linda a junior . Wishing your life away , he thought . The closer it came time for Ruth to arrive , the more his hands trembled . Would she notice anything different about him ? She got home at five-fifteen . " The traffic was terrible , " she announced , her voice querulous . " Did you give them the certified check and explain about the other one ? " he asked , trying to ignore the tone in her voice . It was her let's-have-this-out tone . " I certainly did . And let me tell you , the bursar was shocked when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these years . They had Ethel on a panel at college six months ago , blasting off on women getting equal pay . " Ruth accepted the glass of wine he handed her and took a long swallow . With a shock he realized that somewhere along the way she 'd picked up Ethel 's habit of licking her lips after sheMary Higgins Clarkfinished an angry sentence . Was it true that you kept marrying the same person ? The thought made him want to burst into hysterical laughter . " Well , let 's have it . Did you see her ? " Ruth snapped . A great weariness came over Seamus . The memory of that final scene . " Yes , I saw her . " " And ... He chose his words carefully . " You were right . She does n't want it to leak out that she 's been collecting alimonyfrom me all these years . She 's going to let me off the hook . " Ruth set down the wineglass , her face transfigured . " I do n't believe it . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taunting , derisive laugh at his threatening and begging words . The jolt of primitive anger that had gone through him , the look of terror in her eyes . . . Her final threat ... Oh God .. . " Now when Ethel buys her precious Neeve Kearny clothes and eats high on the hog , you wo n't be paying . " Ruth 's triumphant laugh pounded against his eardrums as her words sank into his consciousness . Seamus put down his wineglass . " What made you say that ? " he asked his wife quietly . On Saturday morning the snow was over and the streets were somewhat passable . Neeve brought all Ethel 's clothes back to the shop . Betty rushed to help her . " Do n't tell me , she does n't like anything ? " " How would I know ? " Neeve asked . " There was n't hide nor hair of her at her apartment . Honest to God , Betty , 46While My Pretty One Sleepswhen I think of the way we rushed , I could wrap every stitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'd run a small ad in the Times showing the print dresses and the raincoats , and the responsewas enthusiastic . Neeve 's eyes sparkled as she watched her clerks write up formidable sales slips . Once again , she silently blessed Sal for staking her six years ago . At two o'clock , Eugenia , a black former fashion model who was now Neeve 's second-in-command , reminded Neeve that she had n't stopped for lunch . " I have some yogurt in the fridge , " she offered . Neeve had just finished helping one of her personal clients select a four-thousand-dollar mother-of-the-bride gown . She smiled quickly . " You know I hate yogurt . Send for a tuna-salad sandwich and a diet Coke , okay ? " Ten minutes Wer , when the order was delivered to her office , she realized she was starving . ' The best tuna salad in New York , Denny , " she told the delivery man . " If you say so , Miss Kearny . " His pale face creased into an ingratiating smile . While she hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , Ethel did not answer . Throughout the afternoon the receptionist continued to try to reach her . At the end of the day Neeve told Betty , " I 'll take this stuff home once more . I sure do n't want to waste my Sunday having to come back here because Ethel suddenlydecides she 's got a plane to catch and needs everything in ten minutes . " " Knowing her , she 'd have the plane make a special trip to the gate if she 'd missed it , " Betty snapped . They both laughed , but then Betty said quietly , " You47Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One Sleepsknow those crazy feelings you get sometimes , Neeve . I swear they 're catching . Pain in the neck that Ethel is , she never pulled anything like this before . " Saturday night , Neeve and Myles went to the Met to hear Pavarotti . " You should be out on a date , " Myles com- plained as the waiter at the Ginger Man handed them after-theater supper menus . Neeve glanced at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot . You know that . When someone important comes along , I 'll know it , just the way you and Mother did . Now why do n't you order me some shrimp scampi ? " Myles usually attended early Mass on Sunday . Neeve en- joyed sleeping late and going to the Pontifical Mass at the cathedral . She was surprised to find Myles in the kitchen in his bathrobe when she got up . " Giving up the faith ? " she asked . " No . I thought I 'd go with you today . " He tried to sound casual . " Would that have anything to do with Nicky Sepetti 's release from prison ? " Neeve sighed . " Do n't bother to an- swer . " After church they decided on brunch at Cafe des Ar- tistes , then caught a movie in the neighborhood theater . When they got back to the apartment , Neeve again dialed Ethel Lambston 's number , let the phone ring a half- dozen times , shrugged and raced Myles in their weekly contest to finish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Neeve commented as she 148 bent over Myles 's chair to kiss the top of his head after the eleven-o'clock news . She caught the look on his face . " Do n't say it , " she warned . Myles pressed his lips together . He knew she was right . He 'd been about to say , " Even if it 's clear tomorrow , I wish you would n't jog alone . " The persistent ringing of the phone in Ethel Lambston 's apartment did not go unnoticed . Douglas Brown , Ethel 's twenty-eight-year-old nephew , had moved into the apartment on Friday afternoon . He 'd hesitated about taking the risk , but knew he could prove he 'd been forced that day out of his illegal sublet . " I just needed a place to stay while I found a new apartment . " That would be his explanation . He figured it would be better not to answer the phone . The frequent calls irritated him , but he did not want to advertise his presence . Ethel never wanted him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " she 'd told him . Other people might have been told the same thing . He was sure it had been a wise decision not to answer the doorbell on Friday evening . The note slipped under the door into the foyer was about the clothes Ethel had ordered . Doug smiled unpleasantly . That must have been the errand Ethel had scheduled for him . Sunday morning Denny Adler waited impatiently in thE sharp , gusty wind . Precisely at eleven o'clock , he saw aMary Higgins Clark I While My Pretty One Sleepsblack Chevy approaching . With long strides , he hurried from the comparative shelter of Bryant Park onto the street . The car pulled over . He opened the passenger door and slid in . The car was moving even as he yanked the door closed . In the years since Attica , Big Charley had gotten a lot grayer and put on more weight . The steering wheel was burrowed between the folds of his stomach . Denny said , " Hi , " not expecting an answer . Big Charley nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the George Washington Bridge . Charley turned onto the Palisades Interstate Parkway . Denny noted that while the remaining snow in New York was slushy and soot-filled , the snow on the sides of the parkway was still white . New Jersey , the Garden State , he thought sarcastieaI ly . Mal Exit 3 there was a lookout point for people who , as Ih  --  nny sometimes observed , had nothing better to do than stare at the New York landscape across the Hudson River . Denny was not surprised when Charley pulled into the deserted parking area there . This was where they 'd discussed other jobs . Charley turned off the ignition and reached back over the seat , groaning with the effort of stretching . He pulled up a paper bag containing a couple of cans of beer and dropped it between them . " Your brand . " Denny felt pleased . " Nice of you to remember , Charley . " He opened the can of Coors . Charley swallowed deeply from his own can before he replied , " I forget nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ten thousand , " he told Denny . " The same when the job is finished . " Denny accepted the envelope , taking sensual pleasure in its bulk . " Who ? " " You deliver lunch to her coupla times a week . She lives in Schwab House , that big place on Seventy-fourth between West End and Riverside Drive . Usually walks to and from work coupla times a week . Cuts through Central Park . Grab her handbag and waste her . Clean out the wallet and dump the bag so it looks like a junkie cut her . If you ca n't nail her in the park , the garment center might be it . She goes there every Monday afternoon . Those streets are packed . Everybody in a rush . Trucks double-parked . Brush by her , shove her in front of a truck . Take your time . It got ta look like an accident or a mugging . Follow her around in one of those panhandler outfits of yours . " Big Charley 's voice was thick and guttural , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choking his vocal cords . For Charley it had been a long speech . He took another deep draught from the beer can . Denny began to feel uneasy . " Who ? " " Neeve Kearny . " Denny shoved the envelope toward Charley as though it contained a ticking bomb . " The Police Commissioner 's daughter ? Are you nuts ? " " The ex-Commissioner 's daughter . " Denny could feel the perspiration on his brow . " Kearny was in office for sixteen years . Not a cop in the city who would n't risk his life for him . When his wife died they put the heat on everyone who ever stole an apple off a cart . No way . " There was an almost imperceptible change in Big Charley'sexpression , but his voice was the same guttural50Mary Hlmglna Clark While My Pretty One Sleepsmonotone . " Denny , I told you I never forget . Remember all those nights in Attica when you used to brag about the jobs you got away with and how you did it ? All I need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wo n't get to deliver another baloney sandwich . Do n't make me a crime-stopper , Denny . " Denny considered and , remembering , cursed his own big mouth . Again he fingered the envelope and thought of Neeve Kearny . He 'd been delivering to her shop for nearly a year now . It used to be that the receptionist would tell him to leave the bag with her , but now he went right back to the private office . Even if Kearny was on the phone , she 'd wave and smile , a real smile , not that tightlippedsnobby nod that most of his customers gave him . She always told him how great everything tasted . And she sure was a good-looking babe . Denny shrugged off the moment of sentiment . It was a job he had to do . Charley would n't turn him in to the cops , and they both knew it . His knowledge of the contracthad made him too dangerous . To refuse it meant that he 'd never make it back to the George Washington Bridge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Charley said . " What are your hours at the deli ? " " Nine to six . Mondays off . " " She leaves for work between eight-thirty and nine . Start hanging around her apartment building . The shop closes at six-thirty . Remember , take your time . It ca n't look like a deliberate hit . " Big Charley started up the engine for the return trip to New York . Once again he fell into his customary silence , 52broken only by the grunting sound of his breathing . An overwhelming curiosity was consuming Denny . As Charleyturned off the West Side Highway and drove across Fifty-seventh Street , Denny asked , " Charley , got any idea who ordered the job ? She do n't seem like the kind to get in anyone 's way . Sepetti got sprung . Sounds like he 's got a memory . " He felt the angry eyes flash in his direction . The gutturalvoice was now clear , and the words fell with the impact of a rock slide . " You 're getting careless , Denny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The guy who contactedme do n't know . The guy who contacted him do n't know . That 's how it works , and no questions asked . You 're a small-time , small-mind bum , Denny , and some things are none of your business . Now get out . " The car stopped abruptly at the corner of Eighth Avenueand Fifty-seventh Street . Uncertainly , Denny opened the door . " Charley , I 'm sorry , " he said . " It was just ... " The wind was whipping through the car . " Just shut up and make sure that job gets done right . " An instant later , Denny was staring at the back of Charley'sChevy as it disappeared down Fifty-seventh Street . He walked toward Columbus Circle , stopped at a street vendor for a hot dog and a Coke . When he had finished , he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand . His nerves began to settle . His fingers caressed the bulky envelope inside the pocket of his jacket . " Might as well start earning my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to head up Broadway toward SeventyfourthStreet and West End Avenue . At Schwab House , he sauntered casually around the53block , noting the Riverside Drive entrance to the building . No chance she 'd use that . The West End Avenue one was much more convenient . Satisfied , he crossed the street and leaned against the building directly opposite Schwab House . It would make a great observation point , he decided . The door opened near him , and a cluster of residents came out . He did n't want to be observed , so he casually moved on , reflecting that his wino outfit would make him blend into the backgroundwhile he stalked Neeve Kearny . At two-thirty , as he crossed town toward the East Side , he passed a line of people waiting to buy tickets for the movie . His narrow eyes widened . Halfway along the queue Neeve Kearny was standing next to a white-haired man whose face Denny recognized . Her father . Denny hurried by , his head buried in his neck . And I was n't even looking for her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit I ever made. 4 1 On Monday morning , Neeve was in the lobby , her arms once again filled with Ethel 's clothes , when Tse-Tse , a **27;17150;TOOLONG , emerged breathlessly from the elevator . Her curly blond hair was early Phyllis Diller . Her eye makeup was violent shades of purple . Her small , pretty mouth had been painted into a Kewpie-doll bow . Tse-Tse , bornMary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One SleepsMary Margaret McBride , " After guess who ? " as she 'd explained to Neeve , was always appearing in **27;17179;TOOLONG , most of which lasted less than a week . Neeve had gone to see her several times and had been astonished at how really good Tse-Tse was . Tse-Tse could move a shoulder , droop a lip , change her posture and literally become someone else . She had an excellent ear for accents and could range her voice from a Butterfly McQueen high pitch to a Lauren Bacilli throaty drawl . She shared a studio apartment in Schwab House with another in favor of cleaning . " Fifty bucks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pooperscooper , " as she 'd explained to Neeve . Neeve had suggested Tse-Tse to Ethel Lambston , and she knew Tse-Tse cleaned for Ethel several times a month . Now she regarded her as a messenger from heaven . As the cab arrived , she explained her dilemma . " I 'm supposed to go there tomorrow , " Tse-Tse explainedbreathlessly . " Honest to God , Neeve , that place is enough to drive me back to walking pit bulls . No matter how tidy I leave it , the next time it 's always in shambles . " " I 've seen it . " Neeve considered . " Look , if Ethel does n't pick up this stuff today , I 'll take you there in a cab tomorrow morning and leave everything in her closet . You have a key , I guess . " " She gave me one about six months ago . Let me know . See you . " Tse-Tse blew Neeve a kiss and started jogging down the street , a flamingo with her penned golden hair , her crazy makeup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow sneakers . At the shop , Betty helped Neeve again hang Ethel 's purchaseson the Will Call rack in the sewing room . " This has gone beyond Ethel 's rattlebrain behavior , " she said quietly , a worried frown creasing the permanent furrows in her forehead . " Do you think she 's been in an accident ? Maybe we should report her missing . " Neeve piled the accessory boxes next to the rack . " I can ask Myles to check about accident reports , " she said , " but it 's too soon to report her missing . " Betty grinned suddenly . " Maybe she 's found a boyfriendat last and is off somewhere on an ecstatic week-end . " Neeve glanced through the open door onto the sales floor . The first customer had arrived , and a new saleswomanwas showing her gowns that were absolutely unsuitablefor her . Neeve bit her lip . She knew she had something of Renata 's fiery temperament and had to watch her tongue . " For Ethel 's sake , I hope so , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the customer and the saleswoman . " Marian , why do n't you bring the green chiffon Della Rosa gown ? " she suggested . It was a briskly busy morning . The receptionist kept trying Ethel 's number . The last time she reported no response , Neeve had the fleeting thought that if Ethel had met a man and ended up eloping , no one would cheer louder than Ethel 's former husband , who after twentytwoyears was still sending alimony checks every month. 56 57Mary Higgins ClarkMonday was Denny Adler 's day off . He had planned to spend it following Neeve Kearny , but on Sunday evening there was a call for him at the public phone in the hallwayof the rooming house . The manager of the deli told Denny he 'd have to come in to work the next day . The counterman had been fired . " I was figuring out the books and the sonofabitch had his hand in the till . I need you . " Denny swore silently . But it would be stupid to refuse . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung up , he thought of Neeve Kearny , the smile she 'd given him the day before when he delivered lunch , the way that coalblackhair framed her face , the way her breasts filled out the fancy sweater she 'd been wearing . Big Charley said that she went to Seventh Avenue on Monday afternoons . That meant there 'd be no point trying to catch up with her after work . Maybe just as well . He 'd made plans for Monday evening with the waitress at the bar across the street and had n't wanted to break them . As he turned to walk the dank , urine-smelling hallway back to his room , he thought , You wo n't get to be another Monday 's child , Kearny . Monday 's child was fair of face . But not after a few weeks in the cemetery . Monday afternoon was Neeve 's usual time to spend on Seventh Avenue . She loved the bizarre bedlam of the Garment District , the crowded sidewalks , the delivery trucks double-parked on the narrow streets , the agile deliveryboys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everyone rushing , no time to spare . While My Pretty One SleepsShe 'd begun coming here with Renata when she was about eight years old . Over Myles 's amused objections , Renata had taken a part-time job in a dress shop on Seventy-secondStreet , just two blocks from their apartment . Before long , the aging owner turned over to her the job of buying for the shop . Neeve could still visualize Renata shaking her head no as an overeager designer tried to persuade her to change her mind about an outfit . " When a woman sits down in that dress , it will crawl up her back , " Renata would say . Whenever she felt strongly , her Italian accent would leap into her voice . " A woman should get dressed , look in the mirror to make sure she does n't have a run in her stocking , a drooping hem , and then she should forget what she is wearing . Her clothes should fit like a second skin . " Renata had pronounced it " skeen . " But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the cameo pin one of them had presented to Rena ta . She had been the first to introduce his line . " Your mama , she gave me my first break , " Jacob Gold would remind Neeve . " A beautiful lady , and she knew fashion . Like you . " It was his highest compliment . Today as Neeve wended her way from Seventh Avenue through the West Thirties , she realized she was vaguely distressed . There was a throbbing pain somewhere in her psyche , like an emotional sore tooth . She grumbled to herself , Before long , I 'll be really one of those superstitiousIrish , always getting a " feeling " about trouble around the corner . At Artless Sportswear , she ordered linen blazers with matching Bermuda shorts . " I like the pastels , " she murmured , " but-they need a dynamite something . " 58 59Mary Higgins Clark " We 're suggesting this blouse . " The clerk , order pad in hand , pointed to a rack of pale nylon blouses with white buttons . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neeve wandered through the showrooms , then spotted a multicoloredsilk T shirt . " That 's what I mean . " She picked up several of the T shirts in different color patterns and brought them over to the suits . " This with the peach ; that one with the mauve . Now we 've got something going . " At Victor Costa , she chose romantic boat-necked chiffonsthat floated on the hangers . And once again Renata drifted into her mind . Renata in a black velvet Victor Costa , going to a New Year 's Eve party with Myles . Around her throat she 'd worn her Christmas present , a pearl necklace with a cluster of small diamonds . " You look like a princess , Mommy , " Neeve had told her . That moment had been imprinted on her memory . She 'd been so proud of them . Myles , straight and elegant with his then prematurely white hair ; Renata , so slender , her jet-black hair piled in a chignon . The next New Year 's Eve , a few people came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now a bishop , and Uncle Sal , who was still struggling to make his mark as a designer . Herb Schwartz , Myles 's deputy commissioner , and his wife . Renata had been dead seven weeks ... Neeve realized that the clerk was waiting patiently at her elbow . " I 'm woolgathering , " she apologized , " and it is n't the season for that , is it ? " She placed her order , went quickly to the next three houses on her list and then , as darkness began to fall , headed for her usual visit to Uncle Sal . While My Pretty One SleepsThe showrooms of Anthony della Salva were now spread throughout the Garment District . His sportswear line was on West Thirty-seventh Street . His accessories on West Thirty-fifth . His licensing on Sixth Avenue . But Neeve knew she would find him in his main office on West Thirty-sixth . He had started there in a tiny tworoomhole-in-the-wall . Now he occupied three sumptuouslyequipped floors . Anthony della Salva , ne SalvatoreEsposito from the Bronx , was a designer on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de la Renta . To Neeve 's dismay , as she crossed Thirty-seventh Street she came face to face with Gordon Steuber . Meticulouslydressed in a tan cashmere jacket over a brownand-beigeScottish pullover , dark-brown slacks and Gucci loafers , with his blaze of curly brown hair , slender , evenfeaturedface , powerful shoulders and narrow waist , GordonSteuber could easily have had a successful career as a model . Instead , in his early forties , he was a shrewd businessman with an uncanny knack of hiring unknown young designers and exploiting them until they could afford to leave him . Thanks to his young designers , his line of women 's dresses and suits was exciting and provocative . He makes plenty without having to cheat illegal workers , Neeve thought as she stared coldly at him . And if , as Sal hinted , he was in income-tax trouble , good ! They passed each other without speaking , but it seemed to Neeve that anger emanated from his persona . She thought of hearing that people emitted an aura .

An instant later , Anthonydella Salva , " Uncle Sal , " came bounding through the door . His cherubic face beamed as he hurried to embraceher . Neeve smiled as she took in Sal 's outfit . He was his own best ad for his spring line of menswear . His version of a safari outfit was a cross between a paratrooper 's jumpsuit and Jungle Jim at his best . " I love it . It will be all over East Hampton next month , " she said approvingly as she kissed him . " It already is , darling . It 's even the rage of Iowa City . That frightens me a little . I must be slipping . Come . Let 's get out of this . " On the way to his office , he stopped to greet some out-of-town buyers . " Are you being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wonderful . Susan , show the lazytimeline . It will walk out of the store , I promise you . " " Uncle Sal , do you want to take care of those people ? " Neeve asked as they cut through the showroom . " Absolutely not . They 'll waste two hours of Susan 's time and end up buying three or four of the cheapest pieces in the place . " With a sigh of relief he closed the door of his private rooms . " It 's been a crazy day . Where does everyone get the money ? I raised my prices again . They 're outrageous and people are fighting to put in rush orders . " His smile was beatific . His round face had become puffy in the last years , and now his eyes crinkled till they were lost under his heavy lids . He and Myles and the Bishop had grown up in the same Bronx neighborhood , played stickball together , gone to Christopher Columbus High School together . It was hard to believe that he too was sixty-eight years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk . " Can you beat this ? We have an order to design interiors for scalemodelMercedes for three-year-olds . When I was three I had a secondhand red wagon , and one of the wheels kept falling off . Every time it did , my father beat me up for not taking care of my good toys . " Neeve felt her spirits lift . " Uncle Sal , honest to God I wish I had you on tape . I could make a fortune blackmailingyou . " " You 're too good-hearted . Sit down . Have a cup of coffee . It 's fresh , I promise . " " I know you 're busy , Uncle Sal . Five minutes only . " Neeve unbuttoned her jacket . " Will you drop the ' uncle ' business ? I 'm getting too old to be treated with respect . " Sal eyed her critically . " You look good , as usual . How 's business ? " " Great . " " How 's Myles ? I see Nicky Sepetti got sprung Friday . I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was upset Friday and pretty good over the weekend . Now I 'm not sure . " " Invite me up to dinner this week . I have n't seen him for a month . " " You 're on . " Neeve watched as Sal poured coffee from the Silex on a tray beside his desk . She glanced around . " I love this room . " The wall covering behind the desk was executed in a mural of the Pacific Reef motif , the design that had made Sal famous . Sal often told her about his inspiration for that line . " Neeve , I was in the Aquarium in Chicago . It was 1972 . Fashion was a mess that year . Everyone sick of the mini-62 63Mary Higgins Clark ' While My Pretty One Sleepsskirt . Everyone afraid to try something new . The top designerswere showing men-tailored suits , Bermuda shorts , skinny unlined suits . Pale colors . Dark colors . Ruffled blouses that belonged in boarding school . Nothingthat makes a woman say , ' I want to look like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the floor with the Pacific Reef exhibit . Neeve , it was like walking underwater . Tanks from floor to ceiling were filled with hundreds of exotic fish and plants and coral trees and shells . The colors on everything  --  you 'd think Michelangelo painted them ! The patterns and designs  --  dozens and dozens , every one unique . Silver blending into blue ; coral and red entwined . One fish was yellow , bright as the morning sun , with black markings . And the flow , the grace of movement . I thought , If I can only do this with fabric ! I started sketching right on the spot . I knew it was great . I won the Coty Award that year . I turned the fashion industry around . Couturier sales were fantastic . Licenses for the mass market and accessories . And all because I was smart enough to copy Mother Na-ture . " Now he followed her gaze . " That design . Wonderful . Cheerful . Elegant . Graceful . Flattering . It 's still the best thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't caught up with me yet . Next week I 'll give you a preview of my fall line . The second-best thing I 've ever done . Sensational . How 's your love life ? " " It is n't . " " What about that guy you had to dinner a couple of months ago ? He was crazy about you . " " The fact you ca n't remember his name says it all . He still makes a pile of money on Wall Street . Just bought aCessna and a co-op in Vail . Forget it . He had the personalityof a wet noodle . I keep telling Myles and I 'll tell you : When Mr. Right comes along , I 'll know it . " " Do n't wait too long , Neeve . You 've been raised on the fairy-tale romance of your mother and father . " Sal swallowedthe last of his coffee with a great gulp . " For most of us , it do n't work like that . " Neeve had a fleeting moment of amusement reflecting that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the suave Italian accent disappeared and his native jargon took over . Sal continued . " Most of us meet . We get a little interested . Then not so interested . But we keep seeing each other and gradually something happens . Not magic . Maybe just friendship . We accommodate . We may not like opera , but we go to the opera . We may hate exercise but start playing tennis or jogging . Then love takes over . That 's ninety percent of the people in the world , Neeve . Believe me . " " Was that the way it happened for you ? " Neeve asked sweetly . " Four times . " Sal beamed . " Do n't be so fresh . I 'm an optimist . " Neeve finished the coffee and got up feeling immensely cheered . " I think I am , too , but you help bring it out . How 's Thursday for dinner ? " " Fine . And remember , I 'm not on Myles 's diet and do n't say I should be . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hurried through the showroom . With a practiced eye , she studied the fashions on his mannequins . Not brilliant but good . Subtle use of color , clean lines , innovative64 65without being too daring . They 'd sell well enough . She wondered about Sal 's fall line . Was it as good as he claimed ? She was back in Neeve 's Place in time to discuss the next window display with the decorator . At six-thirty , when she closed the shop , she began the now familiar job of carrying home Ethel Lambston 's purchases . Once again there had been no message from Ethel ; no response to the half-dozen phone calls . But at least there was an end in sight . Tomorrow morning she 'd accompanyTse-Tse to Ethel 's apartment and leave everything there . That thought made her mind jump to a line from the poignant Eugene Field poem " Little Boy Blue " : " He kissed them and put them there . " As she tightened her hold on the armful of slippery garment bags , Neeve remembered that Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next morning , Tse-Tse met her in the lobby promptly at eight-thirty . Tse-Tse was wearing her hair in braided coils pinned over her ears . A black velvet cape hung loosely from her shoulders to her ankles . Under it she was attired in a black uniform with a white apron . " I just got a part as a parlor-floor servant in a new play , " she confided as sheMary Higgins Clarktook boxes from Neeve 's hands . " I thought I 'd practice . If Ethel 's there she gets a kick out of it when I 'm in costume . " Her Swedish accent was excellent . Vigorous bell-ringing did not elicit a response at Ethel'sapartment . Tse-Tse fumbled in her purse for the key . When she opened the door , she stepped aside and let Neeve precede her . With a sigh of relief , Neeve dropped the armful of clothes on the couch and started to straighten up . " There is a God , " she murmured , then her voice trailed off . A muscular young man was standing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bath . Obviously in the process of dressing , he was holding a tie in one hand . His crisp white shirt was not yet fully buttoned . His pale-green eyes , set in a face that with a different expression might have been attractive , were narrowed by an annoyed frown . His as yet uncombed hair fell over his forehead in a mass of curls . Neeve 's startled response to his presence was replaced by the immediate sense that his tangled hair was the product of a body wave . From behind her , she heard Tse-Tse draw in her breath sharply . " Who are you ? " Neeve asked . " And why did n't you answer the door ? " " I think the first question is mine . " The tone was sarcastic . " And I answer the door when I choose to answer it . " Tse-Tse took over . " You are Miss Lambston 's nephew , " she said . " I have seen your picture . " The Swedish accent rose and fell from her tongue . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am . Would you mind telling me who you are ? " The sarcastic tone did not abate. 68While My Pretty One SleepsNeeve felt her temper rising . " I 'm Neeve Kearny , " she said . " And this is Tse-Tse . She does the apartment for Miss Lambston . Do you mind telling me where Miss Lambston is ? She claimed she needed these clothes on Friday and I 've been carrying them back and forth ever since . " " So you 're Neeve Kearny . " Now the smile became insolent . " Number-three shoes go with beige suit . Carry number-three purse and wear box-A jewelry . Do you do that for everyone ? " Neeve felt her jaw harden . " Miss Lambston is a very good customer and a very busy woman . And I 'm a very busy woman . Is she here , and if not , when is she coming back ? " Douglas Brown shrugged . Something of the animosity left him . " I have no idea where my aunt is . She asked me to meet her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Friday afternoon ? " Neeve asked quickly . " Yes . I got here and she was n't around . I have a key and let myself in . She never came back . I made up the couch and stayed . I just lost my sublet , and the Y is n't my speed . " There was something too glib about the explanation . Neeve looked around the room . The couch on which she 'd laid the clothes had a blanket and a pillow piled together at one end . Piles of papers were thrown on the floor in front of the couch . Whenever she 'd been here before , the cushions were so covered with flies and magazinesit was impossible to see the upholstery . Stapled clippings from newspapers were jumbled on the dinette table . Because the apartment was street level , the win-69Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One Sleepsdows were barred , and even the bars had been used as makeshift files . At the opposite end of the room , she could see into the kitchen . As usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with carelessly framed pictures of Ethel , pictures that had been cut from newspapers and magazines . Ethel receivingthe Magazine Award of the Year from the AmericanSociety of Journalists and Authors . That had been for her scathing article on welfare hotels and abandoned tenements . Ethel at the side of Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson . She 'd worked on his 1964 campaign . Ethel on the dais at the Waldorf with the Mayor the night ContemporaryWoman had honored him . Neeve was struck by a thought . " I was here early Friday evening , " she said . " What time did you say you arrived ? " " About three . I never pick up the phone . Ethel has a thing about anyone answering it when she 's not here . " " That 's true , " Tse-Tse said . For a moment she forgot her Swedish accent . Then it came back . " Yah , yah , it 's true . " Douglas Brown slipped his tie over his neck . " I 've got to get to work . Just leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Tse-Tse . " And if you can find some way to clean this place up , that 's fine , too . I 'll pile my stuff togetherjust in case Ethel decides to favor us with her presence . " Now he seemed in a hurry to get away . He turned and started for the bedroom . " Just a minute , " Neeve said . She waited until he stopped and looked over his shoulder . " You say you came around three o'clock on Friday . Then you must have been here when I was trying to deliver these clothes . Would you mind explaining why you would n't answer the door that night ? It could have been Ethel forgetting her key . Right ? " " What time did you get here ? " " Around seven . " " I 'd gone out for something to eat . Sorry . " He disappeared into the bedroom and pushed the door closed . Neeve and Tse-Tse looked at each other . Tse-Tse shrugged . " I might as well get busy . " Her voice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean Stockholm faster than this place with all the junk around . " She dropped the accent . " You do n't suppose anything happened to Ethel , do you ? " " I 've thought about having Myles call for accident reports , " Neeve said . " Although I must say the loving nephew does n't seem frantic with worry . When he gets out , I 'll hang these things in Ethel 's closet for her . " Douglas Brown emerged from the bedroom a moment later . Fully dressed in a dark-blue suit , a raincoat over his arm , his hair brushed into a thick , wavy coiffure , he looked sullenly attractive . He seemed surprised and not pleased that Neeve was still there . " I thought you were so busy , " he told her . " Are you planning to help clean ? " Neeve 's lips narrowed ominously . " I 'm planning to hang these clothes in your aunt 's closet , so she 'll be able to put her hands on them when she needs them , and then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " You will let me know if you hear from her . I , for one , am getting concerned . " Douglas Brown glanced at the card and pocketed it . " I do n't see why . In the two years I 've lived in New York , 70Mary HlMna Clark I While My Pretty One Sleepsshe 's pulled the disappearing act at least three times and usually managed to keep me cooling my heels in a restaurantor this place . I 'm beginning to think she 's certifiably nuts . " " Are you planning to stay until she returns ? " " I do n't see that is any of your business , Miss Kearny , but probably yes . " " Do you have a card where I can reach you during business hours ? " Neeve felt her temper rising . " Unfortunately , at the Cosmic Oil Building , they do n't have cards made for receptionists . You see , like my dear aunt , I 'm a writer . Unfortunately , unlike her , I have not yet been discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul together by sitting at a desk in Cosmic 's lobby and confirming the appointments of visitors . It 's not the job for a mental giant , but then Herman Melville worked as a clerk on Ellis Island , I believe . " " Do you consider yourself a Herman Melville ? " Neeve did not try to conceal the sarcasm in her voice . " No . I write a different sort of book . My latest is calledThe Spiritual Life of Hugh Hefner . So far no editor has seen the joke in it . " He was gone . Neeve and Tse-Tse looked at each other . " What a creep , " Tse-Tse said . " And to think he 's poor Ethel 's only relative . " Neeve searched her memory . " I do n't think she ever mentioned him to me . " " Two weeks ago when I was here , she was on the phone with him and real upset . Ethel squirrels money around the apartment , and she thought some of it was missing . She practically accused him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly made Neevefeel claustrophobic . She wanted out of this place . " Let 's get these clothes put away . " If Douglas Brown had slept on the couch the first night , it was clear he had been using Ethel 's bedroom since then . There was an ashtray full of cigarettes on the night table . Ethel did n't smoke . The antique-white provincialfurniture was , like everything else in the apartment , expensive but lost in clutter . Perfumes and a tarnished silver brush , comb and mirror set were scatteredon the dresser . Ethel had notes to herself jammed into the large gold-framed mirror . Several men 's suits , sports jackets and slacks were draped over a rose damask chaise longue . A man 's suitcase was on the floor , shoved under the chaise . " Even he did n't have the nerve to disturb Ethel 's closet , " Neeve observed . The back wall of the fairly large bedroom consisted of an elaborate closet that ran the length of the room . Four years ago when Ethel first asked Neeve to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no wonder she never could put any outfits together . She needed more space . Three weeks later Ethel had invitedNeeve back . She had led her to the bedroom and proudly displayed her new acquisition , a custom-built closet that had cost her ten thousand dollars . It had short poles for blouses , high poles for evening gowns . It was sectioned off so that coats hung in one area , suits in another , daytime dresses in another . There were shelves for sweaters and purses ; racks for shoes ; a jewelry unit with brass extensions shaped like branches of a tree , to hold necklaces and bracelets . A pair of ghoulishly real plaster hands were upraised as though in prayer , the fingersseparated. 172 1 73 1Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One SleepsEthel had pointed to them . " Do n't they look as though they could strangle you ? " she 'd asked gleefully . " They 're for rings . I told the guy from the closet place that I keep everything in marked boxes , but he said I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't take it , he told me . " In contrast to the rest of the apartment , the closet was exquisitely neat . The clothes were hung precisely on the satin hangers . Zippers were fastened up to the top . Jacketswere buttoned . " Ever since you started dressing her , people keep commenting on Ethel 's clothes , " Tse-Tse observed . " Ethel loves it . " On the inside of the doors , Ethel had pasted the lists Neeve had given her , which accessoriesto wear with which outfits . " I went through everything with Ethel last month , " Neeve murmured . " We made room for the new stuff . " She laid the clothes on the bed and began to peel the plastic bags from them . " Well , I 'll just do what I 'd have done if she were standing here . Get this load in place and tack up the list . " As she sorted and hung the new garments , she skimmed the contents of the closet . Ethel 's sable coat . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Burberry . The herringbone cape . The white wraparound with caracul collar . The belted leather . Next came the suits . The Donna Karans , the Beenes , the Ultrasuedes , the  --  Neeve paused , the hangers with the two new suits still in her hand . " Wait a minute , " she said . She peered up at the top shelf . She knew that Ethel 's Vuitton luggage consisted of four matching pieces in a tapestry motif . They were agarment-bag carryall with zippered pockets , a carry-on oversized tote , a large and a medium-sized suitcase . The garment bag , the tote and one suitcase were missing . " Good old Ethel , " Neeve said as she hung the new suits hi the closet . " She did take off . That beige ensemble with the mink collar is gone . " She began poking through the racks . The white wool suit , the green knit , the black-andwhiteprint . " So help me , she just packed up and took off . I swear I could choke her myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look , " she said , pointing at the list on the door and then the bare spots on the shelves . " She took everything she needed to get all gussied up . I guess the weather was so lousy , she decided she did n't need light spring things . Well , wherever she is , I hope it hits ninety degrees . Che noiosa spera che muore di caldo  --  " " Easy , Neeve , " Tse-Tse said . " Whenever you start lapsinginto Italian , you 're getting mad . " Neeve shrugged . " The blazes with it . I 'll send my bill to her accountant . At least he has his head screwed on tight . He does n't forget to pay on time . " She looked at Tse-Tse . " What about you ? Were you counting on getting paid today ? " Tse-Tse shook her head . " Last time she paid me in advance . I 'm okay . " At the shop , Neeve related to Betty what had happened . " You should charge her your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That woman is the limit : " 74 75Mary Higgins Clark At noon when Neeve spoke to Myles , she told him what had happened . " And I was about to have you check the accident reports , " she said . " Listen , if a train saw that woman in its path , it would jump the track to duck her , " Myles replied . But , for some reason , Neeve 's irritation did not last . Instead , the nagging , persistent feeling that something was wrong about Ethel 's sudden departure stayed with her . It accompanied her when she closed up at six-thirty and rushed to the cocktail party in the St. Regis given by Women 's Wear Daily . In the glitter of the fashionably dressed crowd , she spotted Toni Mendell , the elegant ed- itor in chief of Contemporary Woman , and hurried over to her . " Do you know how long Ethel will be gone ? " she man- aged to ask over the din . " I 'm surprised she is n't here , " Toni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we all know Ethel . " " When is her fashion article due ? " " She turned it in Thursday morning . I had to have the . lawyers go over it to make sure we do n't get sued . They made us cut out a few things , but it 's still wonderful . You heard about the big contract she has with Givvons and Marks ? " " No . " A waiter offered canapes , smoked salmon and caviar on toast points . Neeve helped herself to one . Toni mourn- fully shook her head . " Now that waists are back in , I ca n't afford even an olive . " Toni was a size six . " Anyhow , the article is about the great looks of the last fifty years and the designers behind them . Let 's face it , the subject has been done and done , but you know Ethel . She makes everything gossipy and fun . Then two weeks ago she got terribly mysterious . I gather the next day she charged into Jack Campbell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on fashion with a six-figure advance . She 's probably holed up somewhere writing it . " " Darling , you look divine ! " The voice came from somewherebehind Neeve . Toni 's smile revealed every one of her faultlessly capped teeth . " Carmen , I 've left a dozen messages for you . Where have you been hiding yourself ? Neeve began to edge away , but Toni stopped her . " Neeve , Jack Campbell just came in . He 's that tall guy in the gray suit . Maybe he knows where you can reach Ethel . " By the time Neeve had made her way across the room , Jack Campbell was already surrounded . She waited , listening to the congratulations he was accepting . From the gist of the conversation , she gathered that he had just been made president and publisher of Givvons and Marks , that he had bought an apartment on East FiftysecondStreet , and that he was sure he 'd thoroughly enjoy living in New York . She judged him to be in his late thirties , young for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She suspectedthat if longer , it would have been quite curly . His body had the lean , taut look of a runner . His face was thin ; his eyes were the same dark brown as his hair . His smile seemed genuine . It caused small crinkles to form at the corner of his eyes . She liked the way he bent his head forward to listen to the elderly editor who was speaking to him and then turned to someone else withoutseeming abrupt. 76 77 A real art , Neeve thought , the kind of thing politicians did naturallY , but not many businessmen . It was possible to keep observing him without being obvious . What was there about Jack Campbell that seemed familiar ? Something . She 'd met him before . But where ? A waiter passed and she accepted another glass of wine . Her second and last , but at least sipping it made her look busy . " It 's Neeve , is n't it ? " In the moment she 'd turned her back to him , Jack Campbell had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago , six years ago . You were on your way back from skiing and I 'd been on a sales trip . We started talking five minutes before the plane landed . You were all excited about opening a dress shop . How did it work out ? " " Fine . " Neeve vaguely remembered the exchange . She 'd bolted out of the plane to make her connecting flight . Jobs . That was it . " Were n't you just starting work for a new publisher ? " " Yes . " " Obviously , it was a good move . " " Jack , there are some people I 'd like you to meet . " The editor in chief of W was plucking his sleeve . " I do n't want to keep you , " Neeve said quickly . " But just one question . I understand Ethel Lambston is writ- ing a book for you . Do you know where I can reach her ? " " I have her home number . Will that help ? " " Thanks , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a quick , self-deprecating gesture . " I must n't hold you up . " She turned and slipped through the crowd , suddenly weary of the babble of voices and conscious that it had been a long day . The usual cluster of people waiting for cabs crowded the sidewalk in front of the St. Regis . Neeve shrugged , walked to Fifth Avenue and started uptown . It was a pleasant enough evening . Maybe she 'd cut through the park . A walk home would clear her head . But at Central Park South a cab deposited a fare directly in front of her . She hesitated , then held the door and got in . The idea of walking another mile in high heels was suddenly distinctlyunattractive . She did not see the frustrated expression on Denny 's face . He had waited patiently outside the St. Regis and followed her up Fifth Avenue . When she began to head for the park he thought that his opportunity was at hand . At two o'clock that morning , Neeve awakened from a sound sleep . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethel 's closet , making a list . A list . " I hope she melts , wherever she is . " That was it . Coats . The sable . The jacket . The cape . The Burberry . The wraparound . The coachman . They were all there . Ethel had turned in her article on Thursday . No one had seen her on Friday . Both days had been windy and miserably cold . There 'd been a snowstorm on Friday . But every one of Ethel 's winter coats was still in place , in her closet ... . While My Pretty One SleepsNleky Mepettl shivered in the cable-knit cardigan his wife had made for him the year he went to prison . It still fit at the shoulders , but now it hung loosely over his middle . He 'd lost thirty pounds in prison . It was only a block from his home to the boardwalk . Shaking his head impatiently at his wife 's fussing  --  " Put on a scarf , Nicky , you 've forgotten how strong the wind is from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed it behind him . The tang of the salty air tickled his nostrils , and he breathed it appreciatively . When he was a kid growing up in Brooklyn , his mother used to take him down on the bus for a swim at Rockaway Beach . Thirty years ago he 'd bought the house in Belle Harbor for a summer place for Marie and the kids . She 'd moved here for good after his sentencing . Seventeen years that ended last Friday ! His first deep breath outside prison walls brought on waves of chest pain . " Avoid the cold , " the doctors had cautioned him . Marie had had a big dinner cooked , a sign , " Welcome Home , Nicky . " He 'd been so bushed that halfway through the meal he 'd gone to bed . The kids had phoned , Nick Junior and Tessa . " Poppa , we love you . " they said . He had n't let them visit him in prison . Tessa was just starting college when he went to jail . Now she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her husband called her Theresa . Nick Junior had changed his name to Damiano . That was Marie 's maiden name . Nicholas Damiano , a CPA who lived in Connecticut . " Do n't come now , " Nicky cautioned them . " Wait till the press is n't hanging around . " All weekend , he and Marie stayed in the house , two silent strangers , while the television cameras waited for him to come out . But this morning they 'd been gone . Stale news . That 's all he was . A sick ex-con . Nicky breathed in the salt air and felt it 1111 his lungs . A baldheaded guy in one of those crazy sweatsuits was jogging toward him , stopped . " Great to see you , Mr. Sepetti . You 're looking great . " Nicky frowned . He did n't want to listen to that stuff . He knew how he looked . After he had showered , only half an hour ago , he 'd studied himself fully and deliberately in the mirror on the bathroom door . Hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringes . When he started serving time , it had been black shot with silver : pepper and salt , the barber used to say . Now what was left of it was a faded gray or a dirty white , take your choice . The rest of the self-examination had n't cheered him any . Protruding eyes that had always annoyed him . even when he was a pretty good-looking younger guy . Now they stuck out like marbles . A faint scar on his cheek that flamed against the pallor of his skin . The weight loss had n't made him trim . Instead he looked saggy , like a pillow that had lost half its feathers . A man pushing sixty . He 'd been forty-two when he went to jail . " Yeah , I look great , " he said . " Thanks . " He knew that the guy who was blocking the sidewalk , beaming at him with a nervous , big-toothed smile , lived two or three houses up , but he could n't remember his name . He must have sounded annoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're back . " His smile wasMary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One Sleepsforced now . " Terrific day , is n't it ? Pretty cool , but you can tell spring is here . " If I want a weather report , I 'll turn on the radio , Nicky thought , then raised his hand in a salute . " Yeah , yeah , " he muttered . He walked quickly on until he reached the boardwalk . The wind had whipped the ocean into a mass of churningfoam . Nicky leaned on the guardrail remembering how when he was a kid he used to love to ride the waves . His mother was always hollering at him , " Do n't go out so far . You 'll drown . You 'll see . " Restlessly he swung his body around and began walkingclown toward Beach Ninety-eighth Street . He 'd go until he could see the roller coaster and then start back . The guys were coming to pick him up . They 'd go to the club first and then have a celebration lunch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he did n't kid himself . Seventeen years was too long to be away . They 'd gotten into stuff he never would have let them touch . The word was out that he was sick . They 'd complete what they 'd started in these last years . Ease him out . Take it or else . Joey had been sentenced with him . Same amount of time . But Joey got out in six years . Joey was in charge now . Myles Kearny . He could thank Kearny for those extra eleven years . Nicky bent his head against the wind , still trying to cope with two bitter pills . His kids might claim they loved him , but they were embarrassed by him . When Marie went to visit them , she told their friends she was a widow . Tessa . God , she 'd been crazy about him when she was a little kid . Maybe he 'd been wrong not to let her visit him all these years . Marie went to see her regularly . Out there , and in Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Tessa 's kids . But her husband thought he should wait . Marie . Nicky could feel the resentment in her for all the years she 'd waited . It was worse than resentment . She tried to act glad to see him , but her eyes were cold and veiled . He could read her mind : " For what you did , Nicky , even among our friends we were outcasts . " Marie was only fifty-four and looked ten years older . She worked in the personnel office of the hospital . She did n't have to , but when she took the job she 'd told him , " I ca n't just sit in the house and look at four walls . " Marie . Nick Junior , no , Nicholas , Tessa , no , Theresa . Would they have been really sorry if he 'd had a heart attack in prison ? Maybe if he 'd gotten out in six years like Joey it would n't have been too late . Too late for everything . The extra years he 'd served because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they 'd been able to figurea way to keep him in . Nicky had passed Ninety-eighth Street before he realized he had n't noticed the lumbering structure that was the ancient roller coaster , then was startled to see it had been torn down . He turned and began retracing his steps , shoving his chilled hands into his pockets , hunching his shoulders against the wind . The taste of bile was in his mouth , blotting out the fresh , salty tang of the sea on his lips .... The car was waiting for him when he got home . Louie , was behind the wheel . Louie , the one guy he could always182 83Mary I wins Clark While My Pretty One Sleepsturn his back to . Louie who did n't forget favors . " Any time you 're ready , Don Sepetti , " Louie said . " It 's good to say that to you again . " Louie meant it . Nicky saw the hint of sullen resignation in Marie 's eyes when he went into the house and changed his sweater for a suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he 'd had to do a short-story report . He 'd chosen a story about a guy who disappears and his wife thinks he 's dead and " she comfortably settled herself into her life as a widow . " Marie had comfortably settled herself into a life without him . Face it . She did n't want him back . His children would be relieved if he vanished , Jimmy Hoffa style . Better yet , they 'd like a nice , clean , natural death , one that did n't need explanations for their kids later on . If only they knew how close they were to having it all work out for them . " Will you want supper when you come home ? " Marie asked . " I mean , I 'm on the noon-to-nine shift . Should I fix something and leave it in the refrigerator ? " " Forget it . " He was silent on the trip down the Fort Hamilton Parkway , through the Brooklyn  --  Battery Tunnel , into lower Manhattan . At the club , nothing had changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table with chairs grouped ready for the next game ; the oversized , tarnished . espresso machine ; the pay telephone that everyone knew was tapped . The only difference was in the attitude of the family . Oh sure , they clustered around him , paid their respects , smiled , phony welcoming smiles . But he knew . He was glad when it was time to go to Mulberry Street . Mario , the restaurant owner , at least seemed glad to see him . The private room was ready for them . The pastas and the entrees were his favorites from the years before Jail . Nicky felt himself start to relax , felt some of the old power flow into his body . He waited until dessert was nerved , cannoli with rich , black espresso coffee , before he looked from face to face of the ten men who were sitting like two identical rows of tin soldiers . He nodded , acknowledgingthose on his right side , then those on his left . Two of the faces were new to him . The one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmen Machado . " Nicky studied him carefully . About thirty , dark thick hair and eyebrows , blunt nose , scrawny , but tough . He 'd been around three , four years . Been in the slammer for auto theft when Alfle got to know him , they said . InstinctivelyNicky did not trust him . He 'd button Joey down on how much they really knew about him . His eyes came to rest on Joey . Joey who had gotten out in six years , who had taken over control while he , Nicky , was locked up . Joey 's round face was creased in lines that passed fora smile . Joey looked like the cat who swallowed the canary . Nicky realized his chest was burning . Suddenly the dinner was lying heavy in his stomach . " Okay , so tell me , " he ordered Joey . " What 's on your mind ? " Joey continued to smile . " With respect , I got great news for you . We all know how you feel about sonofabitch Kearny . Wait till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his daughter . And it 's not ours . Steuber is gon na waste her . It 's almost like a gift to you . " Nicky jumped up and slammed his fist on the table . Awash with rage , he hammered the heavy oak . " You stu-84 85Mary Higgins Clarkpid bastards ! " he shouted . " You stinking , stupid bastards ! Get it called off . " He had a momentary impression of Carmen Machado , and suddenly knew he was looking into the face of a cop . " Get it called off . I tell you to get it called off , understand ? " Joey 's expression turned from fear to concern to pity . " Nicky , you have to know that 's impossible . Nobody can cancel a contract . It 's too late . " Fifteen minutes later , beside a silent Louie at the driver 's wheel , Nicky was on his way home to Belle Harbor . His chest was aflame with waves of pain . The nitroglycerin under his tongue was useless . When Kearny 's kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung it on him , and Joey knew it . Drearily he realized he 'd been a fool to warn Joey about Machado . " No way that guy worked in Florida for the Palino family , " he 'd told Joey . " You were too dumb to check him out , right ? You stupid bastard , every time you open your mouth you 're spilling your guts to a cop . " On Tuesday morning Seamus Lambston woke after four hours of sleep that had been plagued with troubled dreams . He 'd closed up the place at two-thirty , read the paper for a while and silently crept into bed trying not to disturb Ruth . When the girls were young , he 'd been able to sleep later , get to the bar at noon , come home for an early dinner with the family and then go back till closing . But86While My Pretty One Sleepsin the last years as business fell off in a relentlessly unchangingpattern and the rent doubled and doubled again , he 'd let bartenders and waiters go and cut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menu . He did all the buying himself , got to the place by eight or eight-thirty and , except for a rushed dinner , stayed until closing . And he still could n't keep his head above water . Ethel 's face had haunted his dreams . The way her eyes bulged when she was angry . The sardonic smile that he 'd eradicated from her face . When he 'd arrived at her place on Thursday afternoon , he 'd pulled out a snapshot of the girls . " Ethel , " he 'd pleaded , " look at them . They need the money I 'm paying you . Give me a break . " She had taken the picture and studied it carefully . " They should have been mine , " she said as she handed it back to him . Now his stomach squeezed in apprehension . His alimonypayment was due on the fifth . Tomorrow . Did he dare not write the check ? It was seven-thirty . Ruth was already up . He could hear the splashing of the shower . He got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as den and office . It was already harshly bright from the rays of the early-morning sun . He sat at the rolltop desk that had been in his family for three generations . Ruth hated it . She wanted to be able to replace all their old heavy furniture with modern pieces in light , airy colors . " In all these years , I 've never bought so much as a new chair , " she liked to remind him . " You left Ethel all your good furniture when you87Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One Sleepsbroke up , and I 've had to live with the junk from your mother . The only new furniture I ever had were the cribs and beds for the girls and nothing like what I wanted for them . " Seamus put off the agony of decision about Ethel 's check by writing some of the others . The gas and electric , the rent , the telephone . They 'd canceled cable TV six months ago . That saved twenty-two dollars a month . From the kitchen he heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few minutes later Ruth came into the den , with a glass of orange juice and a cup of steaming hot coffee on a small tray . She was smiling and for an instant reminded him of the quietly pretty woman he 'd married three months after his divorce . Ruth was not given to affectionate gestures , but when she set the tray on the desk she bent down and kissed the top of his head . " Seeing you write the monthly checks makes it really sink in , " she said . " No more money to Ethel . Oh God , Seamus , we can finally begin to breathe . Let 's celebrate tonight . Get someone to cover for you . We have n't gone out to dinner in months . " Seamus felt the muscles in his stomach twist . The rich t ; . smell of the coffee suddenly made him nauseous . " Honey , I just hope she does n't change her mind , " he faltered . " I mean I have n't got anything in writing . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let her return it ? I really think that would be best . Because then we 'd have something legal , I mean , proof that she said it was okay to stop paying . " His voice choked to a gasp as a stinging slap snapped his head over his left shoulder . He looked up and wincedat the murderous outrage on Ruth 's face . He had seen that look on another face only a few days ago . Then Ruth 's expression dissolved into bright-red spots on her cheekbones and weary tears that welled in her eyes . " Seamus , I 'm sorry . I just snapped . " Her voice broke . She bit her lip and straightened her shoulders . " But no more checks . Let her try to go back on her word . I 'll kill her myself rather than let you pay her another dime . " While My Pretty One Sleeps6 On Wednesday morning , Neeve told Myles about her concern over Ethel . Frowning as she spread cream cheese on a toasted bagel , she voiced the thoughts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rattlebrained enough to fly off without her new clothes , but she had made a date with her nephew for Friday . " " Or so he claims , " Myles interjected . " Exactly . I do know that on Thursday she turned in the article she was writing . Thursday was freezing cold , and it started to snow late in the day . Friday was like the middle of winter . " " You 're turning into a meteorologist , " Myles observed . " Come on , Myles . I think something might be wrong . All of Ethel 's warm coats were in her closet . " " Neeve , that woman will live forever . I can just see God and the Devil telling each other , Take her , she 's yours . ' " Myles smiled , enjoying his joke . Neeve made a face at him , exasperated that he was not taking her concern seriously , but grateful for the banteringtone . The kitchen window was open a few inches , bringing in a breeze from the Hudson , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fumes of the thousands of cars that traveled the Henry Hudson Parkway . The snow was vanishing in the same abrupt manner it had arrived . Spring was in the air and maybe that fact had helped Myles 's spirits . Or was there something else ? Neeve got up , went over to the stove , reached for the coffeepot and freshened both their cups . " You seem pretty chipper today , " she commented . " Does that mean you 've stopped worrying about Nicky Sepetti ? " " Let 's just say I spoke to Herb and I 'm satisfied that Nicky wo n't be able to brush his teeth without one of our boys gazing at his cavities . " " I see . " Neeve knew better than to ask Myles any more about that . " Well , as long as you stop fussing over me . " She looked at her watch . " I 've got to get moving . " At the door , she hesitated . " Myles , I know Ethel 's wardrobe like90Mary Higgins Clark the back of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitterly cold weather without a coat . How would you explain that ? " Myles had started to read the Times . Now he put it down , his expression patient . " Let 's play the pretend game , " he suggested . " Let 's pretend that Ethel may have seen a coat in someone else 's show window and decided it was just what she wanted . " The pretend game had started when Neeve was four and had helped herself to a forbidden can of soda . She 'd looked up from the open refrigerator door , where she was blissfully draining the last drop , to see Myles eying her sternly . " I 've got a good idea , Daddy , " she 'd said hur- riedly . " Let 's play the pretend game . Let 's pretend the Coke is apple juice . " Neeve suddenly felt foolish . " That 's why you 're the cop and I run a dress shop , " she said . But by the time she had showered and dressed , in a boxy cocoa-brown cashmere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered black wool midcalf skirt , she had located the fallacy in Myles 's think- ing . Long ago the Coke had n't been apple juice , and right now she 'd stake everything she had that Ethel had n't purchased a coat from anyone else . On Wednesday morning , Douglas Brown awakened early and began to expand his domination over Ethel 's apart- ment . It had been a pleasant surprise on returning from work last night to find it sparkling clean and as reason- ably tidy as any human being could make it , given Ethel 's massive piles of papers . He 'd found some frozen meals in the freezer , selected a lasagna and sipped a cold beer while it heated . Ethel 's television set was one of the new massive forty-inch units , and he 'd set up a tray in the living room , eating while he watched . Now , from the luxury of her silk-sheeted four-poster bed , he eyed the contents of the bedroom . His suitcase was still on the chaise , his suits draped over the back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start using that precious closet of hers , but no reason he could n't settle into the other one . The front closet was clearly a catchall . He managed to arrange the photo albums and stacks of catalogues and piles of magazines so that he could use the clothes pole for his suits . While coffee perked , he showered , appreciating the sparkling white tile , the fact that Ethel 's rubble of perfumebottles and lotions was now neatly arranged on the glass tray to the right of the door . Even the towels were folded in the bathroom linen closet . That thought brought on a frown . The money . Had that Swedish kid who cleaned for Ethel found the money ? The thought made Doug jump from the shower , rub his lean body vigorously , wrap the towel around his middleand rush to the living room . He 'd left a single hundred-dollar bill under the carpet near the wing chair . It was still there . So either the Swedish kid was honest or she had n't noticed it . Ethel was such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every month from her ex , she had it cashed into one-hundred-dollar bills . " My mad money , " she told Doug . That was the money she used when she took him out to dinner in an expensive restaurant . " They 're eating92 93Mary Higgins Clark 1 While My Pretty One Sleeps beans and we 're dining on caviar , " she 'd say . " Sometimes I go through it all in a month . Sometimes it piles up . Every so often I look around and send the leftover bucks to my accountant toward clothes . Restaurants and clothes . That 's what the stupid worm has kept me in all these years . " Doug had laughed with her , clicking glasses as they toasted Seamus the worm . But that night he 'd realized that Ethel never kept track of how much cash she had hidden around and so would never miss a couple of hundred bucks a month . Which was what he 'd helped himself to these last two years . A couple of times she 'd half suspected , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she 'd always backed right off . " If you 'd just write down when you spend that money , you 'd see where it goes , " he 'd shouted . " I 'm sorry , Doug , " Ethel had apologized . " You know me . I get a bee in my bonnet and start shooting off my mouth . " He blotted out the memory of that last conversation when she 'd demanded that he run an errand for her on Friday and told him not to expect a tip . " I took your advice , " she said , " and kept track of what I spent . " He 'd rushed over here , sure of his ability to sweet-talk her , knowing that if she dumped him she 'd have nobody she could order around .... When the coffee was ready , Doug poured a cup , went back into the bedroom and dressed . As he knotted his tie , he surveyed himself critically in the mirror . He looked good . The facials he 'd started having with the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd also found a decent barber . The two suits he 'd bought recently fitted him the way clothes were supposed to fit . The new receptionist at Cosmic had big eyes for him . He had let her know that he was only doing this crummy desk job because he was writing a play . She knew Ethel 's name . " And you 're a writer , too , " she 'd breathed in awe . He would n't mind bringing Linda here . But he had to be careful , for a while at least ... . Over a second cup of coffee , Doug methodically went through the papers in Ethel 's desk . There was one cardboardexpansion folder marked " Important . " As he flipped through it , his face drained of color . That old windbag Ethel had blue-chip stocks ! She had property in Florida ! She had a million-dollar insurance policy ! There was a copy of her will in the last section of the folder . He could n't believe his eyes when he read it . Everything . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she was worth a bundle . He 'd be late for work , but it did n't matter . Doug restoredhis clothes to the back of the chaise , made the bed carefully , got rid of the ashtray , folded a quilt , a pillow and sheets on the couch to suggest he 'd slept there , and wrote a note : " " Dear Aunt Ethel . Guess you 're on one of your unexpected trips . Knew you would n't mind if 1 continue to bunk on the couch until my new place is ready . Hope you 've been having fun . Your loving nephew , Doug . " And that establishes the nature of our relationship , he thought as he saluted Ethel 's picture on the wall by the front door of the apartment . At three o'clock on Wednesday afternoon , Neeve left a message at Tse-Tse 's answering service . An hour later , 94 95Mary Higgins Clark ' Tse-Tse phoned . " Neeve , we just had a dress rehearsal . I think the play is great , " she exulted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Yah , ' but you never know . Joseph Papp might be in the audience . " " You 'll be a star yet , " Neeve said , meaning it . " I ca n't wait to brag I knew her when . ' Tse-Tse , I have to get back into Ethel 's apartment . Do you still have her key ? " " Nobody 's heard from her ? " Tse-Tse 's voice lost its lilt . ' ' Neeve , there 's something weird going on . That nutty nephew of hers . He 's sleeping in her bed and smoking in her room . Either he does n't expect her back or he does n't care if she tosses him out on his ear . " Neeve stood up . Suddenly she felt cramped behind her desk , and the samples of gowns and purses and jewelry . and shoes strewn about her office seemed terribly unim- portant . She 'd changed to a two-piece dress from one of her newest designers . It was a pale-gray wool with a silver ' belt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her knees . A silk scarf in tones of gray , silver and peach was knotted at her neck . Two customers had ordered the outfit when they saw her wearing it on the sales floor . " ' Tse-Tse , " she asked , " would it be possible for you to go to Ethel 's apartment again tomorrow morning ? If she 's there , line . Admit you were worried about her . If the nephew is around , could you say that Ethel wanted you to do some extra work , clean out the kitchen cabinets or whatever ? " " Sure , " Tse-Tse agreed . " I 'd love to . This is off-off- Broadway , do n't forget . No salary , just prestige . But I have to tell you , Ethel is n't worried about the state of her kitchen cabinets . " " If she turns up and does n't want to pay you , I will , " Neeve said . " I want to go with you . I know she has an appointment book in her desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what plans she may have made before she disappeared . " They agreed to meet at eight-thirty the next morning in the lobby . At closing time , Neeve turned the lock on the Madison Avenue entrance to the store . She went back into her office for a quiet time over desk work . At seven she phoned the Cardinal 's residence on Madison Avenue and was put through to Bishop Devin Stanton . " I got your message , " he told her . " I 'll be delighted to come up to dinner tomorrow night , Neeve . Sal 's coming ? Good . The Three Musketeers from the Bronx do n't get together enough these days . Have n't seen Sal since Christmas . Has he gotten married again , by any chance ? " Just before he said goodbye the Bishop reminded Neeve that his favorite dish was her pasta al pesto . " The only one who could make it better was your mother , God rest her , " he said gently . Devin Stanton did not usually refer to Renata in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been chatting with Myles about Nicky Sepetti 's release . He rang off before she could pin him down about that . You 'll get your pesto , Uncle Dev , she thought  --  but you 'll also get a flea in your ear . I ca n't have Myles hovering over me for the rest of my life . Just before she left , she phoned Sal 's apartment . As usual , he was in bubbling good humor . " Of course I have n't forgotten tomorrow night . What are you having ? I 'll bring the wine . Your father only thinks he knows about wine . " 97Laughing with him , Neeve replaced the receiver , turned off the lights and went outside . The capricious April weather had turned cool again , but even so she felt the absolute need for a long walk . To appease Myles , she had n't jogged in nearly a week , and her entire body felt stiff . She walked rapidly from Madison to Fifth Avenue and decided to cut through the park at Seventy-ninth Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Renata 's body had been found . Madison Avenue had still been busy with cars and pedestrians . On Fifth , the taxis and limousines and shiny town cars whizzed by quickly , but on the west side of the street , bordering the park , there were few people . Tossing her head as she approached Seventy-ninth Street , Neeve refused to be deterred . She was just turning into the park when a squad car pulled up . " Miss Kearny . " A smiling sergeant rolled down the window . " How 's the Commissioner doing ? " She recognized the sergeant . At one point he had been Myles 's driver . She went over to chat with him . A few paces behind her , Denny stopped abruptly . He was wearing a long , nondescript overcoat with the collar turned up and a stocking cap . His face was almost concealed . Even so he could feel the eyes of the cop at the passenger window of the squad car boring into him.Cops had long memories about faces , could recognize ones they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now he resumed walking , ignoring Neeve , ignoringthe cops , but he could still feel eyes followinghim . There was a bus stand directly ahead . As a bus pulled up , he joined the cluster of waiting people and got on it . When he paid his fare , he could feel the perspirationforming on his forehead . Another second and that cop might have recognized him . Sullenly Denny took a seat . This job was worth more than he was being paid . When Neeve Kearny went down , forty thousand New York cops would be on a manhunt . As Neeve entered the park , she wondered whether it was just coincidence that Sergeant Collins had happened to spot her . Or , she speculated as she walked rapidly along the path , has Myles got New York 's finest playing guardianangel to me ? There were plentiful joggers , few bicyclers , some pedestrians , a tragic number of homeless resting under layersof newspapers or ragged blankets . They could die there and no one would notice , Neeve thought as her soft Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she found herself glancing over her shoulder . In her teens she had gone to the library and looked up the pictures in the tabloids of her mother 's body . Now , as she hurried with increasingly rapid steps , she had the eerie feeling that she was seeing the pictures again . But this time it was her face , not Renata 's , that covered the front page of the Daily News above the caption " Mur-dered . " Kitty Conway had joined the riding class at Morrison State Park for only one reason . She needed to fill time . Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One SleepsShe was a pretty woman of fifty-eight , with strawberry blonde hair and gray eyes that were enhanced by the fine lines that edged and framed them . There was a time those eyes had always seemed to dance with an amused and impish glow . When she turned fifty , Kitty had protestedto Michael , " How come I still feel twenty-two ? " " Because you are twenty-two . " Michael had been gone for nearly three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mare , she thought of all the activities she 'd become involved in duringthese three years . She now had a real-estate license and was a pretty darn good saleswoman . She 'd redecoratedthe house in Ridgewood , New Jersey , which she and Michael had bought only the year before she lost him . She was active in the Literacy Volunteers . She volunteeredone day a week at the museum . She 'd made two trips to Japan , where Mike Junior , her only child , a career army officer , was stationed , and had delighted in spendingtime with her half-Japanese granddaughter . She 'd also resumed piano lessons without enthusiasm . Twice a month she drove disabled patients to doctor appointments , and now the latest activity was horseback riding . But no matter what she did , no matter how many friends she enjoyed , she was always haunted by the feeling of aloneness . Even now , as she gamely fell in with the dozen other student riders behind the instructor , she found only profound sadness in observing the aura around the trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , Michael , " she whispered , " I wish it would get better . I 'm really trying . " " How are you making out , Kitty ? " the instructor yelled . " Fine , " she shouted . " If you want to be fine , keep your reins short . Show her you 're boss . And keep those heels down . " " Gotcha . " Go to hell , Kitty thought . This damn nag is the worst of the lot . I was supposed to have Charley , but of course you assigned him to that sexy-looking new girl . It was a steep climb up the trail . Her horse stopped to eat every piece of green along the way . One by one , the others in the group passed her . She did n't want to get separated from them . " Come on , damn you , " she murmured . She kicked her heels against the horse 's flanks . In a sudden , violent movement , the mare threw back her head , then reared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal swerved clown a side path . Frantically she tried to remember not to lean forward . Sit back when you 're in trouble ! She felt the loose stones slide under the hoofs . The uneven canter changed to a full gallop , downhill , over the uneven ground . Dear God , if the horse fell , it would crush her ! She tried to slide her boots so that only the tips were still in the stirrups , so as not to get hung up if she fell . From behind , she heard the instructor yelling , " Do n't pull on the reins ! " She felt the horse stumble as a rock gave way under its hind leg . It started to pitch forward , then regained its balance . A piece of black plastic flew up and grazed Kitty 's cheek . She looked down , and an impression of a hand framed by a bright-blue cuff ' darted through her mind and was gone . The horse reached the bottom of the rocky incline and , taking the bit between its teeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang on till the last moment , when she went flying from the saddle as the mare came to an abrupt stop at the watering trough . She felt every100Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One Sleepsbone in her body bounce as she hit the ground , but she was able to pull herself to her feet , shake her arms and legs and move her head from side to side . Nothing seemed to be badly strained or broken , thank God . The instructor galloped up . " I told you , you got ta controlher . You 're the boss . You okay ? " " Never better , " Kitty said . She started for her car . I 'll see you in the next millennium . " A half hour later , gratefully reclining in her steaming , churning bathtub Jacuzzi , she began to laugh . So an equestrian I 'm not , she decided . That 's it for the sport of kings . I 'll just jog like a sensible human being from now on . Mentally she relived the harrowing experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought . The worst part was when that miserable nag slipped . . . . The image of the plastic flying past her face returned . And then , that impression of a hand in a sleeve . How ridiculous . But still , she had seen it , had she not ? She closed her eyes , enjoying the soothing , whirling water , the scent and feel of the bath oil . Forget it , she told herself . The sharply cool evening caused the heat to go on in the apartment . Even so , Seamus felt chilled to the soul . After pushing a hamburger and French fries around on his plate , he gave up the pretense of eating . He was aware of Ruth 's eyes boring into him across the table . " Did you do it ? " she asked finally . " No . " " Why not ? " " Because it might just be better to let it go . " " I told you to put it in writing . Thank her for agreeing that you need the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to rise . " Tell her that in these twenty-two years you 've paid her nearly a quarter of a million dollars on top of a big settlement and it 's obscene to want more for a marriage that lasted less than six years . Congratulate her on the big contract she has for her new book and say that you 're glad she does n't need the money but your kids sure do . Then sign the letter , and drop it in her mailbox . We 'll keep a copy of it . And if she squawks , there wo n't be a person alive who does n't know what a greedy phony she is . I 'd like to see how many colleges drape her with honorary degrees if she reneges . " " Ethel thrives on threats , " Seamus whispered . " She 'd turn a letter like that around . She 'd make the alimony payments sound like a triumph for womankind . It 's a mistake . " Ruth shoved the plate aside . " Write it ! " They had an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they had a clear copy of the letter . Ruth handed Seamus his coat . " Now march yourself over and stick that in her mailbox . " He elected to walk the nine blocks . His head sunk in misery , his hands jammed into his pockets , he fingered the two envelopes he was carrying . One held a check . He had taken it from the back of the checkbook and written it without Ruth 's knowledge . The letter was in the other envelope . Which one should he put into Ethel 's box ? As though she were standing before him , he could see her102 103Mary Higgins Clark reaction to the note . With equal clarity , he could visualize what Ruth would do if he left the check . He turned the corner of West End Avenue onto Eighty- second Street . There were still plenty of people out . Young couples , shopping on the way home from work , their arms filled with groceries . Well-dressed middle- agers , flagging cabs , off to expensive dinners and the the- ater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethel 's building . The mailboxes were in the vestibule inside the locked main door at the top of the steps . Whenever he was down to the wire with the check , he 'd ring the bell for the super- intendent , who 'd let him in to drop the check into Ethel 's mailbox . But today that was n't necessary . A kid he me- ognized as living on the fourth floor brushed past him and started up the steps . On impulse he grabbed her arm . She turned , looking scared . She was a bony-looking kid , thin face , sharp features . Maybe about fourteen years old . Not like his girls , Seamus thought . From somewhere in their genes , they 'd received pretty faces , warm , loving smiles . A moment of profound regret washed over him as he pulled out one of the envelopes . " Would you mind if I went into the vestibule with you ? I have to put something in Miss Lambston 's mailbox . " The cautious expression faded . " Oh sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It must be the fifth of the month . That 's when she always says you deliver the ransom . " The girl laughed , showing gaping spaces between her teeth . Wordlessly , Seamus fumbled in his pocket for the en- velope and waited as she unlocked the door . The murder- ous rage washed over him again . So he was the laughingstock of the building ! The mailboxes were directly inside the outer door . Ethel'swas fairly full . He still did n't know what to do . Should he leave the check or the letter ? The girl waited by the inner door , watching him . " You 're just on time , " she said . " Ethel told my mother she yanks you right into court when you 're late with her check ; " Panic swept over Seamus . It would have to be the check . He grabbed the envelope from his pocket and tried to force it down the'narrow slit in the mailbox . When he arrived home , he nodded yes to Ruth 's fiercely angry question . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur when he admitted he 'd dropped off the alimony . After she stalked out of the room , he hung up his coat and took the second envelope from his pocket . He glanced into it . It was empty . Seamus sank into a chair , his body trembling , bile rising in his throat , his head in his hands . He had managed to fumble again . He had put the check and the letter into the same envelope , and now they were in Ethel 's mailbox .. Nicky Sepetti spent Wednesday morning in bed . The burning in his chest was even worse than last night . Marie was in and out of the bedroom . She brought in a tray with orange juice , coffee , fresh Italian bread spread thick with marmalade . She pestered him to let her call a doctor . Louie arrived at noon , shortly after Marie went to work . " With respect , Don Nicky , you look real sick , " he said . Nicky told him to watch television downstairs . When he was ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 104 105Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One Sleeps Louie whispered , " You were right about Machado . They got him . " He smiled and winked . In early evening , Nicky got up and began to dress . He 'd be better off on Mulberry Street , and it would n't be good for anyone to guess how sick he really was . As he reached for his jacket , his skin became damp with perspiration . Holding on to the poster of the bed , he eased himself down , loosened his tie and shirt collar and lay back on the bed . For the next hours , the chest pain kept swelling and receding like a giant wave . Under his tongue , his mouth began to burn from the nitroglycerin tablets he kept swallowing . They did nothing to ease the pain , only gave him the familiar sharp , brief headache as they melted . Faces began drifting past his vision . His mother 's face : " Nicky , do n't hang around with those guys . Nicky , you 're a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to the mob . No job too big or too small . But never women . That dumb remark he 'd made in the courtroom . Tessa . He 'd really like to see Tessa once more . Nicky Junior . No , Nich- olas . Theresa and Nicholas . They 'd be glad he 'd died in bed like a gentleman . From far away he heard the front door open and close . Marie must have come in . Then the doorbell ringing , a hard and demanding sound . Marie 's angry voice . " I do n't know if he 's home . What do you want ? " I 'm home , Nicky thought . Yeah . I 'm home . The bed- room door swung fully open . Through glazed eyes , he saw the shock on Marie 's face , heard her shriek , " Get a doe- tor . " Other faces . Cops . They did n't have to be in uniform . He could smell them even when he was dying . Then he knew why they were there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right away the cops had come to him , of course ! " Marie , " he said . It came out a whisper . She bent over , put her ear to his lips , smoothed his forehead . " Nicky ! " She was crying . " On ... my . . . mother 's . . . grave ... I ... did n't .. . order . . . Kearny 's wife killed . " He wanted to say that he 'd intended to try to get the contract on Kearny 's kid stopped . But all he managed to cry was " Mama " before a last blinding , tearing pain ripped through his chest , and his eyes went out of focus . His head slumped over on the pillow as his agonized breathing filled the house , and abruptly stopped . How many people had Bigmouth Ethel told that she thought he was helping himself to the money she hid around the apartment ? It was a question that haunted Doug Wednesday morning after he arrived at his desk in the lobby of the Cosmic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doled out plastic visitors ' cards and collected them back again as people departed . Several times , Linda , the seventh-floor receptionist , stopped by to chat with him . Today he was a little cool to her , which she seemed to find intriguing . What would she think if she knew that he was going to inherit a bundle of money ? Where had Ethel made all that loot ? There was only one answer . Ethel had told him that she 'd taken Seamus for his eyeteeth when he wanted out of the marriage . Besides the alimony , she 'd come off with a hefty settlement and had probably been smart enough to invest it . Then that book she wrote five or six years agoMary Higgins Clark had sold well . Ethel , for all her scatterbrained act , had always been pretty shrewd . It was that thought that caused Doug to feel queasy with apprehension . She had known that he was helping himself to money . How many people had she told ? After wrestling with the problem until noon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supercheck funds available in his checking account to take out four hundred dollars . Impatiently he waited on the intermi- nable line at the bank and got the money in hundred- dollar bills . He 'd stash them in some of Ethel 's hiding places , the ones she did n't use most of the time . That way , if anybody searched , the money would be there . Somewhat reassured , he stopped for a hot dog at a food cart and went back to work . At six-thirty , as Doug was rounding the corner from Broadway to Eighty-second Street , he saw Seamus hur- lying down the steps from Ethel 's building . He almost laughed out loud . Of course ! It was the fifth of the month , and Seamus the wimp was there , right on the button with his alimony check , What a sad sack he was in that shabby coat ! Regretfully , Doug realized that it would be a while before he himself could buy any more new clothes . He 'd have to be very , very careful from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day with the key Ethel kept in a box on top of her desk . The envelope from Seamus was jammed into the box , still sticking out a little . Other than that there was mostly junk mail . Ethel 's bills went directly to her accountant . He flipped through the envelopes , then dropped them on the desk . All except the unstamped one , the contribution from Seamus . It 108 had n't been sealed properly . There was a note inside , and the outline of the check was clearly visible . It would be easy to open and reseal it . Doug 's hand lingered on the flap , then , taking care not to cause a tear , he opened the envelope . The check fell out . Boy , he 'd like to have the handwriting on it analyzed . If ever stress showed like a road map , it was in the slanted squiggle that was Seamus ' penmanship . Doug laid the check down , opened the note , read it , reread it and felt his mouth drop in amazement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the check in the envelope , licked the glued area and pressed the flap firmly down . An image of Seamus with his hands hunched in his pockets , almost running as he crossed the street , loomed like a freeze-time in Doug 's mind . Seamuswas up to something . What kind of game was he playing , writing to say that Ethel had agreed not to take any more alimony and then including the check ? In a pig 's eye she let you off the hook , Doug thought . A chill came over him . Had that note been intended for his eyes , not Ethel 's ? When Neeve arrived home , she found to her delight that Myles had done a massive grocery shopping . " You even went to Zabar 's , " she said happily . " I was trying to figure how early I could leave the shop tomorrow . Now I can get everything started tonight . " She had warned him that she 'd be doing paperwork in the shop after closing hours . She uttered a silent prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how she had gotten across town . Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One SleepsMyles had cooked a small leg of lamb , steamed fresh green beans and made a tomato-and-onion vinaigrette salad . He 'd set the small table in the den and had a bottle of burgundy open nearby . Neeve rushed to change into slacks and a sweater , then with a sigh of relief settled into a chair and reached for the wine . ' This is very kind of you , Commish , " she said . " Well , since you 're feeding the aging Musketeers from the Bronx tomorrow night , I figured one good turn deservesanother . " Myles began to carve the roast . Neeve observed him silently . His skin tone was good . His eyes no longer had that sick , heavy look . " I hate to compliment you , but you do realize you look darn healthy , " she told him . " I feel okay . " Myles placed the perfectly done slices of lamb on Neeve 's plate . " I hope I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite . " Great . You have to be feeling better to cook this well . " Myles sipped the burgundy . " Good wine , if I say so myself . " His eyes clouded . Some depression , the doctor had told her . " The heart attack , giving up his job , the bypass ... " " And always worrying about me , " Neeve had injected . - Always worrying about you because he ca n't forgive himself for not worrying about your mother . " " How do I make him stop ? " " Keep Nicky Sepetti in jail . If that 's not possible , by spring urge your father to get busy on some project . Right now his guts are torn , Neeve . He 'd be lost without you , but he hates himself for depending on you emotionally . He 's a proud guy . And something else . Stop babying him . " That had been six months ago . It was spring now . Neeve knew she had made a real attempt to treat Myles in their old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Neeve 's acceptance of the loan from Sal to politics on every level . " You 're the first Kearny in ninety years to vote Republican , " Myles had exploded . " It 's not quite the same as losing the faith : " " It 's getting warm . " And now just when he 's on the right track , he 's all upset about Nicky Sepetti , she thought , and that could go on forever . Unconsciously shaking her head , she glanced around , deciding as always that the den was her favorite room in the apartment . The worn Oriental carpeting was in shades of red and blue ; the-leather couch and the matchingchairs were handsome and inviting . Pictures covered the wall . Myles receiving innumerable plaques and honors . Myles with the Mayor , the Governor , the Republican President . The windows overlooking the Hudson . The tiebackdraperies were the ones Renata had hung . Victorian-era , they were a deep warm blue and crimson , a subtle stripe that shimmered in the reflection of the crystalsconces on the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one her own father had taken when she was the ten-year-old child who had saved Myles and now looked at him adoringly as he lay , his head bandaged , propped on pillows . Renata with Neeve as a baby , with Neeve as a toddler . Renata and Neeve and MylesMary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One Sleeps snorkeling off Maui . That was the year before Renat died . Myles asked about the menu for the next night 's din ner . " I did n't know what you 'd want , so I bought every thing , " he said . " Sal told me he does n't want to eat your diet . The Bishop wants pesto . " Myles grunted . " I can remember when Sal thought a hero sandwich was a rare treat and when Devin 's mother sent him to the deli for nickel fish cakes and a can of Heinz spaghetti . " Neeve had coffee in the kitchen as she began to orga- nize the dinner party . Renata 's cookbooks were on the shelf over the sink . She reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipes . After Renata 's death , Myles had sent Neeve to a private tutor to keep up her conversational Italian . Every sum- mer growing up she 'd spent a month in Venice with her grandparents , and she 'd taken her junior year in college in Perugia . For years she 'd avoided the cookbooks , un- willing to see the notations in Renata 's bold , curlicued hand . " More pepper . Bake only twenty minutes . Hold the oil . " She could see Renata singing to herself as she cooked , letting Neeve stir or mix or measure , exploding , " Cara , this is either a misprint or the chef was drunk . Who could put so much oil in this dressing ? Better to drink the Dead Sea . " Sometimes Renata had drawn quick sketches of Neeve on the margins of the pages , sketches that were charm- ing , beautifully drawn miniatures : Neeve dressed as a princess sitting at the table , Neeve ' hovering over a large mixing bowl , Neeve in a Gibson Girl dress sampling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of profound loss . Even now Neeve could not allow herself to do more than skim her eyes over the sketches . The memoriesthey recalled were too painful . She felt sudden moisture in her eyes . " I used to tell her she should take art lessons , " Myles said . She had not realized he was looking over her shoulder . " Mother liked what she did . " " Selling clothes to bored women . " Neeve bit her tongue . " Exactly how you 'd classify me , I guess . " Myles looked conciliatory . " Oh , Neeve , I 'm sorry . I 'm on edge . I admit it . " " You 're on edge , but you also meant it . Now get out of my kitchen . " Deliberately she slammed pots as she measured , ' poured , cut , sauteed , simmered and baked . Face it . Myles was the world 's leading male chauvinist . If Renata had pursued art , if she 'd developed into a mediocre painter of watercolors , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand that helping women select becoming clothing could make a big differencefor those women in their social and business lives . I 've been written up in Vogue , Town and Country , The New York Times and God knows where else , Neeve thought , but that does n't cut any ice with him . It 's as though I 'm stealing from people when I charge them for expensive clothes . She remembered how annoyed Myles had been when , Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One Sleepsduring their Christmas party , he found Ethel Lambston in the kitchen browsing through Renata 's cookbooks . " Are you interested in cooking ? " he 'd asked her icily . Naturally Ethel had n't noticed his annoyance . " Not at all , " she 'd told him airily . " I read Italian and happened to notice the books . Queste desegni sono stupendi . " She 'd been holding the book with the sketches . Myles had taken it from her hand . " My wife was Italian . I do n't speak the language . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unattached widower and latched onto him for the evening . Finally everything was prepared . Neeve put the dishes into the refrigerator , tidied up and set the table in the dining room . She studiously ignored Myles , who was news watchingcame on . television in the den . As she finished placing the serving dishes on the sideboard , the eleven-o'clock Myles held out a snifter of brandy to her . " Your mother used to bang the pots and pans when she was mad at me , thtoo. " em at Hisyou. " smile was boyish . It was his apology .. Neeve accepted the brandy . " Too bad she did n't throw They laughed together as the phone rang . Myles picked it up . His genial " Hello " was quickly replaced by rapid- fire questions . Neeve watched as his mouth tightened . When he replaced the receiver , he said tonelessly , " That was Herb Schwartz . One of our guys had been planted in Nicky Sepetti 's inner circle . He was just found in a gar- bage dump . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it . " Neeve listened , her mouth going dry . Myles 's face was contorted , but she did n't know what she was seeing in it . " His name is Tony Vitale , " Myles said . " He 's thirty-one years old . They knew him as Carmen Machado . They shot him four times . He should be dead , but somehow he hung on . There was something he wanted us to know . " " What was it ? " Neeve whispered . " Herb was there in the emergency room . Tony told him , ' No contract , Nicky , Neeve Kearny . ' " Myles put his hand over his face as though trying to hide the expression on it . Neeve stared at his anguished face . " You did n't seriouslythink there would be one ? " " Oh yes I did . " Myles 's voice rose . " Oh yes I did . And now for the first time in seventeen years , I can sleep at night . " He put his hands on her shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our guys . And they got there just in time to watch him die . The stinking sonofabitch had a heart attack . He 's dead . Neeve , Nicky Sepetti is dead ! " He put his arms around her . She could feel the wild beating of his heart . " Then let his death free you , Dad , " she begged . Unconsciouslyshe cupped his face in her palms , and remembered that that was Renata 's familiar caress . Deliberately she imitated Renata 's accent . " Caro Milo , leesten to me . " They both managed shaky smiles as Myles said , " I 'll try . I promise . " Undercover detective Anthony Vitale , known to the Sepetticrime family as Carmen Machado , lay in the intensive-careunit of St. Vincent 's Hospital . The bullets had lodged in his lung , split the ribs protecting his chest cavMaryHiggins Clarkity and shattered his left shoulder . Miraculously he was still alive .

I 'll try to make it , he wanted to reassure them . If only he could talk . Had he been able to say anything when they found him ? He had tried to tell them aboutthe contract , but it had n't come out the way he meant it . %Nicky Sepetti and his gang had n't put a contract on Neeve Kearny . Someone else had . Tony knew he 'd been shot on Tuesday night . How long had he been in the hospital ? Dimly he remembered fragments of what they 'd told Nicky about the contract : You ca n't call off a contract . The ex-Commissioner will be planning another funeral . Tony tried to pull himself up . He had to warn them . " Easy does it , " a soft voice murmured . He felt a prick in his arm and a few moments later slid into a quiet , dreamless sleep . Thursday morning at eight o'clock , Neeve andTse-Tse were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On Tuesday , Ethel 's nephew had left for work at eight-twenty . Today they wanted to be certain to avoid him . The cabdriver 's protest , " I do n't get rich on waiting time , " was mollified by Neeve 's promise of a ten-dollar tip . Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One SleepsIt was Tse-Tse who at eight-fifteen spotted Doug . " Look . " Neeve watched as he locked the door of the apartment , glanced around and headed for Broadway . The morning was cool , and he wore a belted trench coat . " That 's a real Burberry , " she said . " He must get paid awfully well for a receptionist . " The apartment was surprisingly tidy . Sheets and a quilt were stacked under a pillow at the end of the couch . The pillow sham was wrinkled . Clearly it had been slept on . There was no sign of a used ashtray , but Neeve was sure she detected the faint odor of cigarette smoke in the air . " He 's been smoking but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she observed . " I wonder why . " The bedroom was a model of neatness . The bed was made . Doug 's suitcase was on the chaise ; hangers with suits , slacks and jackets were laid across it . His note to Ethel was propped against the mirror on the dressing table . " Who 's kidding who ? " Tse-Tse asked . " What made him write that and stop using her bedroom ? " Neeve knew that Tse-Tse had an excellent eye for detail . " All right , " she said . " Let 's start with that note . Has he ever left one for her before ? " Tse-Tse was wearing her Swedish-maid outfit . The coil of braids shook vigorously as she said , " Never . " Neeve walked to the closet and opened the door . Hanger by hanger , she examined Ethel 's wardrobe to see whether she had missed any of her coats . But they were all there : the sable , the stone marten , the cashmere , the wraparound , the Burberry , the leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she was doing . Tse-Tse reinforced her suspicions . " Ethel always tells me that she 's given up being an impulse buyer since you took over dressing her . You 're right . There 's no other coat . " Neeve closed the closet door . " I 'm not happy snooping around like this , but I have to . Ethel always carries a daily calendar in her purse , but I 'm pretty sure she has a ledger-sized one as well . " " Yes she does , " Tse-Tse said . " It 's on her desk . " The appointment book was lying next to a pile of mail . Neeve opened it . It consisted of a full eleven-by-fourteen page for each day of the month , including December of the previous year . She flipped the pages until she reached March 31 . In a bold scrawl , Ethel had written : " Have Doug pick up clothes at Neeve 's Place . " The slot for three o'clock was circled . The notation next to it was " Doug at the apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So he 's not lying about that , " Tse-Tse said . The morning sun had started to pour brightly into the room . Suddenly it vanishedbehind a cloud . Tse-Tse shivered . " Honest to God , Neeve , this place is starting to spook me . " Without answering , Neeve flipped through the month of April . There were scattered appointments , cocktail parties , lunches . All the pages had a line drawn through . On April first , Ethel had written , " Research/Writing Book . " " She canceled everything . She was planning to go away or at least hole up somewhere and write , " Neeve murmured . Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One Sleeps " Then maybe she left a day early ? " Tse-Tse suggested . 1 " It 's possible . " Neeve began to turn the pages backward . The last week of March was crammed with the names of prominent designers : Nina Cochran , Gordon Steuber , Victor Costa , Ronald Altern , Regina Mavis , Anthonydella Salva , Kara Potter . " She ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think that she phones to verify quotes just before she turns an article in . " She pointed to an entry on Thursday , March 30 : " Deadline for Contemporary Woman article . " Quickly she skimmed through the first three months of the year , noticing that next to her appointments Ethel had scrawled in the cost of cabs and tips , memos about lunches , dinners and meetings : " Good interview but annoyedif you keep him waiting .... Carlos new headwaiter at Le Cygne .... Do n't use Valet Limo  --  car smelled like Airwick factory .... " The notes were erratic jottings , the figures often crossed out and changed . Besides that , Ethel was obviouslya doodler . Triangles , hearts , swirls and drawings covered every inch of the pages . On impulse Neeve turned to December 22 , the day of the Christmas party she and Myles had given . Ethel had obviously considered the event important . The address of Schwab House and Neeve 's name were in block letters and underscored . Swirls and twirls accompanied Ethel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " On the side of the page Ethel had drawn a crude imitation of a sketch from Renata 's cookbook . " Myles would have an ulcer if he saw this , " Neeve commented . " I had to tell her that he was still too sick to planany social events . She wanted to invite him to some formaldinner for New Year 's . I thought he 'd choke . " She turned the pages back to the last week in March and began to copy the names Ethel had listed there . " At least it 's a starting place , " she said . Two names jumped out at her . Toni Mendell , the editor of Contemporary Woman . The cocktail party had n't been the place to ask her to search her memory for any comment Ethel might have made about a possible writing retreat . The other name was Jack Campbell . Obviously the book contract had been all-important to Ethel . Maybe she had told Campbell more about her plans than he 'd realized . Neeve snapped her notebook shut and zipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of here . " She reknotted the redand-bluescarf at her throat . The collar of her coat was high , and her mass of black hair was pulled back in a chignon . " You look great , " Tse-Tse observed . " This morning on the elevator , I heard the guy in Eleven C ask who you were . " Neeve pulled on her gloves . " A Prince Valiant type , I trust . " Tse-Tse giggled . " Somewhere between forty and death . A bad rug . Looks like black feathers on a field of cotton . " " He 's yours . Okay , if Ethel pops up or her loving nephew comes home early , you have your story . Do some work on the kitchen cabinets , wash the glasses on the top shelves . Make it look as though you 've been busy , but keep your eyes open . " Neeve glanced at the mail . " Take a look through that . Maybe Ethel received a letter that made her change her mind . God , I feel like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . We both know something 's strange , still we ca n't be marching in and out of here indefinitely . " As she started for the door , Neeve glanced around . " You do manage to make this place look positively livable , " she said . " In a way , it reminds me of Ethel . All you usually notice around here is the surface clutter , and it turns you off . Ethel always acts so dizzy you forget she 's a very sharp lady . " The wall with Ethel 's myriad of publicity pictures was by the door . Her hand on the knob , Neeve studied them carefully . In most of her pictures , Ethel looked as though she 'd been photographed in the middle of a sentence . Her mouth was usually slightly open , her eyes blazing with energy , the muscles of her face visibly in motion . One snapshot caught Neeve 's eye . The expression was tranquil , the mouth quiet , the eyes sad . What was it Ethel had once confided ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember , huh ? But do you know how many years it 's been since anyone sent me a card or bothered to phone me ? I end up singing ' Happy Birthday ' to myself . " Neeve had made a mental note to send Ethel flowers and invite her out to lunch the past Valentine 's Day , but she 'd been away that week skiing in Vail . I 'm sorry , Ethel , she thought . I 'm really sorry . It seemed to her that the mournful eyes in the snapshotwere unforgiving . After his bypass surgery , Myles had begun the habit of taking long afternoon walks . What Neeve did not know was that for the last four months he had also been seeingWhile My Pretty One Sleepsa psychiatrist on East Seventy-fifth Street . " You 're sufferingfrom depression , " his cardiologist had told him bluntly . " Most people do , after this kind of operation . It goes with the territory . But I suspect yours had other roots . " He 'd bullied Myles into making the first appointment with Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hated the idea of lying on a couch and instead sat in a deep leather chair . Adam Felton was not the stereotypical psychiatrist Myles had expected . In his midforties , he had a crew cut , somewhat rakish-looking glasses and a slender , wiry body . By the third or fourth visit , he had won Myles 's trust . Myles no longer felt he was baring his soul . Instead he had the feeling that when he spoke to Felton it cornparedwith being back in the squad room , laying out all the aspects of an investigation to his men. itFunny , he thought now as he watched Felton twirl a pencil between his fingers , it never occurred to me to talk to Dev instead . But this was not a matter for the confessional . " I did n't think that shrinks were supposed to have nervous habits , " he observed dryly . Adam Felton laughed and gave the pencil he was twirlinganother deft spin . " I have every right to a nervous habit when I 'm giving up smoking . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made casually to an acquaintance at a cocktail party . Myles told him about Nicky Sepetti 's death and at Felton'sprobing questions exclaimed , " We 've been through Pp this territory . I 've had seventeen years of feeling as though something would happen to Neeve the minute Sepetti got out . I failed Renata . How many damn times do I have to tell you that ? I did n't take ! Vicky 's threat122Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One Sleepsseriously . He 's a cold-blooded killer . He was n't out three days before our guy was shot . Nicky probably fingered him . He always said he could smell a cop . " " And now you feel your daughter is safe ? " " I know she 's safe . Our guy was able to tell us there 's no contract on her . It must have been discussed . I know the rest of them would n't try . They were going to ease Nicky out anyhow . They 'll be happy to drape him in a casket blanket . " Adam Felton began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisively into the wastebasket . " You 're telling me that Sepetti 's death has released you from a fear that has haunted you for seventeen years . What does that mean to you ? How will it change your life ? " Forty minutes later when Myles left the office and resumedhis walk , his step was reminiscent of the brisk pace that at one time was typical of him . He knew that he was almost fully recovered physically . Now that he did n't have to worry about Neeve , he 'd take a job . He had n't told Neeve that he 'd had inquiries about his availabilityto head up the President 's Drug Enforcement Agency in Washington . It would mean spending a lot of time there , getting an apartment . But it would be good for Neeve to be on her own . She 'd quit spending so much time home and get involved with young people . Before he got sick she used to spend summer weekends in the Hamptons and do a lot more skiing in Vail . In the last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few days . He wanted her to get married . He would n't be around124forever . Now , thanks to Nicky 's timely heart attack , he could be in Washington with a free mind . Myles could still remember the awesome pain of his own massive heart attack . It was as though a steamroller with spikes had rolled across his chest . " I hope that 's what you felt on the way out , Buster , " he thought . Then it was as though he could see his mother 's face , sternly fixed on him . Wish evil to someone else and evil will come to you . What goes around comes around . He crossed York Avenue and passed Bella Vita restaurant . The faint delicious aroma of Italian cooking tantalizedhis nostrils , and he thought with pleasure of the dinner Neeve had prepared for tonight . It would be good to get together with Dev and Sal again . God , how long ago it seemed since they were kids growing up on Tenbroeck Avenue . The way people knocked the Bronx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in . Only seven houses on the entire block , woods that were thick with birch and oak . They 'd made tree houses in them . Sal 's parents ' truck garden on what was now industrial Williamsbridge Road . The fields where he and Sal and Devin had gone sleigh riding  --  the Einstein Medical Center covered those fields now . . . . But there were still plenty of good residentialareas . On Park Avenue , Myles walked around a small mound of slushy melting snow . He remembered the time Sal had lost control of his sled and run over Myles 's arm , breakingit in three places . Sal had started to cry , " My father will kill me . " Dev jumped in to take the blame . Dev 's father had come to apologize . " He meant no harm , but he 's a clumsy oaf . " Devin Stanton . His Grace the Bishop. 125Mary Higgins Clark ' While My Pretty One SleepsRumor was , the Vatican had its eye on Dev for the next archdiocese opening , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifth Avenue , Myles glanced to the right . His eye took in the roof of the massive white structurethat was the Metropolitan Museum of Art . He 'd alwaysmeant to get a better look at the Temple of Dendur . On impulse he walked the six blocks and spent the next hour absorbed in the exquisite remnants of a lost civilization . It was only when he consulted his watch and decided it was high time to get home and set up the bar that he realized that his real intention in coming to the museum was to visit the site of Renata 's death . Forget it , he told himself fiercely . But when he was outside , he could not keep his footsteps from leading him around the back of the museum and to the spot where her body had been found . It was a pilgrimage he made every four or five months . A reddish haze around the trees in Central Park was the first promise of the greening that would soon take place . There were a fair number of people in the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with energetic three-year-olds . The homeless , pathetic men and women hunched on benches . A steady stream of traffic . Horse-drawn carriages . Myles stopped at the clearing where Renata had been found . Funny , he thought , she 's buried in Gate of Heaven Cemetery , but for me it 's as though her body is always here . He stood with his head bowed , his hands in the pockets of his suede jacket . If it had been a day like this , there would have been people in the park . Someonemight have seen what was happening . A line from a Tennysonpoem ran through his mind : Dear as remember 'd kisses after death ... Deep as . first love , and wild with all regret ; 0 Death in Life , the days that are no more . But today , for the first time in this place , Myles experienced a tentative sense of healing . " No thanks to me , but at least our girl is safe , carissima mia , " he whispered . " And I hope that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to point his way to hell . " Myles turned and walked briskly through the park . Adam Felton 's final words echoed in his ears : " All right . You do n't have to worry about Nicky Sepetti anymore . You experienced a terrible tragedy seventeen years ago . The point is , are you finally ready to get on with your life ? " Myles whispered again the answer he had snapped decisivelyat Adam . " Yes . " When Neeve arrived at the shop from Ethel 's apartment , most of the staff were already in . Besides Eugenia , her assistant manager , she employed seven regular saleswomenand three seamstresses . Eugenia was dressing the showroom mannequins . " I 'm glad ensembles are in again , " she said as she expertly adjusted the jacket of a cinnamon silk outfit . " Which purse ? " Neeve stood back . " Hold them up again . The smaller one , I think . The other has too much amber for the dress . " When Eugenia retired from modeling , she 'd happily126127Mary Higgins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a size twelve , but she still retainedthe graceful movements that had made her a favoritewith the designers . She hung the purse on the mannequin 's arm . " You 're right as usual , " she said cheerfully . " It 's going to be a busy day . I can feel it in my bones . " " Keep feeling it . " Neeve tried to sound casual , but the effort failed . " Neeve , what about Ethel Lambston ? She still has n't shown up ? " " Not a trace . " Neeve glanced around the shop . " Look , I 'm going to hole up in the office and make phone calls . Unless it 's absolutely necessary , do n't let on that I 'm here . I do n't want to be bothered with salesmen today . " Her first call was to Toni Mendell at Contemporary Woman . Toni was at an all-day seminar of magazine editors . She tried Jack Campbell . He was in a meeting . She left word for him to return her call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his secretary . She went down the list of the designerswhose names had been scribbled in Ethel 's book . The first three she reached had n't seen Ethel last week . She 'd simply called to confirm the direct quotes she was attributing to them . Sportswear designer Elke Pearson summed up the irritation Neeve caught in all their voices . " Why I let that woman interview me I 'll never know . She kept hammering questions at me till I was dizzy . I practically had to throw her out , and I have a hunch I 'm not going to like her damn article . " Anthony della Salva was the next name . Neeve did n't worry when she could n't reach him . She 'd see him tonightfor dinner . Gordon Steuber . Ethel had confided that she 'd crucified him in her article . But when was the last time she saw him ? Reluctantly , Neeve dialed Steuber'soffice and was put through immediately to him . He did not waste his time on amenities . " What do you want ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ornate leather chair with its elaborate brass nailheads . She made her voice as cold as his . " I 've been asked to try to locate Ethel Lambston . It 's quite urgent . " On a hunch she added , " I know from her appointment book that she met with you last week . Did she give you any indication of where she might be planning to go ? " Long seconds passed in total silence . He 's trying to decide what to say , she thought . When Steuber spoke , his tone was detached and even . " Ethel Lambston tried to interview me weeks ago about an article she was writing . I did not see her . I have no time for busybodies . She phoned last week , but I did not accept her call . " Neeve heard a click in her ear . She was about to dial the next designer on the list when her phone rang . It was Jack Campbell . He sounded concerned . " My secretary said your call was urgent . Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to explain to him on the phone that she was worried about Ethel Lambston because Ethel had n't picked up her new clothes . Instead she said , " You 've got to be awfully busy , but is there any chance I could talk to you for about half an hour very soon ? " " I have a lunch date with one of my authors , " he said . " How about three o'clock in my office ? " 128 129Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One SleepsGivvons and Marks occupied the top six floors of the building on the southwest corner of Park Avenue and Forty-first Street . Jack Campbell 's personal office was a huge corner room of the forty-seventh floor with dazzling views of downtown Manhattan . His oversized desk was finished in black lacquer . The bookshelves on the wall behind the desk were filled with manuscripts . A black leather couch and matching chairs were grouped around a glass cocktail table . Neeve was surprised to see that the room was devoid of personal touches . It was as though Jack Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready yet , so I 'm staying at the Hampshire House . Everything I own is still in storage , which is why this place looks like a dentist 's waiting room . " His suit jacket was on the back of his desk chair . He was wearing an argyle sweater in tones of green and brown . It suited him , Neeve decided . Autumn colors . His face was too thin and his features were too irregular to be deemed handsome , but were infinitely attractive in their quiet strength . There was good-humored warmth in his eyes when he smiled , and Neeve found herself glad she had changed to one of her new spring ensembles , a turquoise wool dress and matching stroller-length jacket . " How about coffee ? " Jack offered . " I drink too much of it , but I 'm still going to have some . " Neeve realized she had skipped lunch and her head was vaguely aching . " I 'd love it . Black , please . " While they waited , she commented on the view . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York at least ? " " In the month I 've been here , I 've had to fight to keep my mind on work , " he told her . " I became a would-benative New Yorker when I was ten . That was twenty-six years ago and it took all this time to make the Big Apple . " When the coffee came , they sat around the glass table . Jack Campbell lounged on the couch . Neeve perched on the edge of one of the chairs . She knew he had to have pushed off other appointments to see her so quickly . She took a deep breath and told him about Ethel . " My father thinks I 'm crazy , " she said . " But I 've got a weird feeling that something happened to her . The thing is , did she give you any indication that she might be going off by herself ? I understand that the book she 's writing for you is scheduled for fall release . " Jack Campbell had listened to her with the same attentiveposture she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't , " he said . Neeve felt her eyes widen . " Then how ... ? " Campbell sipped the last drops in his coffee cup . " I met Ethel a couple of years ago at the ABA when she was promoting her first book for Givvons and Marks , the one about women in politics . It was darn good . Funny . Gossipy . Sold well . That 's why when she wanted to see me , I was interested . She gave me a rundown on the article she was doing and said she might have stumbled across a story that would rock the fashion world and if she wrote a book about it , would I buy it and what kind of advance could she expect ? " I told her I obviously had to know more about it , but , based on the success of the last book , if this one was as explosive as she claimed , we 'd buy it and we 'd probably be talking a mid-six-figure advance . Last week I read on Page Six in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half-million dollars and the book would be on the fall130Mary Higgins Clarklist . The phone 's been ringing off the hook . All the softcoverhouses want to have a chance to bid on it . I called Ethel 's agent . She never even talked to him about it . I 've tried phoning her without success . I 've neither confirmednor denied the terms . She 's a real publicity hound , but if she writes the book and if it 's good , all the advance interest is just fine with me . " " And you do n't have any idea what she considered a story that would rock the industry ? " " Not a clue . " Neeve sighed and stood up . " I 've taken enough of your time . I suppose that I should be reassured . It would be just like Ethel to get hot on a project like this and go hole up in a cabin somewhere . I 'd better start minding my own business . " She held out her hand to him . " Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile was quick and warm . " Do you always make such fast getaways ? " he asked . " Six years ago you darted out of the plane like an arrow . The other night when I turned around you 'd disappeared . " Neeve withdrew her hand . " Occasionally , I slow down to a jog , " she said , " but now I 'd better run and pay attention to my own business . " He walked with her to the door . " I hear Neeve 's Place is one of the most fashionable shops in New York . Can I get to see it ? " " Sure . You do n't even have to buy anything . " " My mother lives in Nebraska and wears sensible clothes . " On her way down in the elevator Neeve wondered whether that was Jack Campbell 's way of telling her that there was no special lady in his life . She found that she was humming softly as she stepped out into the now warm April afternoon and hailed a cab . When she reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethel 's apartment immediately . Tse-Tse answeredon the first ring . " Neeve , thank God you called . I want to get out of here before that jerky nephew comes home . Neeve , something is really queer . Ethel has a habit of stashing hundred-dollar bills around the apartment . That 's how she happened to pay me in advance last time . When I was here Tuesday , I saw one bill under the carpet . This morning I found one in the dish closet and three others hidden in the furniture . Neeve , they absolutely were n't here on Tuesday . " Seamus left the bar at four-thirty . Oblivious of the jostlingpedestrians , he darted along the crowded sidewalk up Columbus Avenue . He had to go to Ethel 's apartment , and he did n't want Ruth to know he 'd been there . Since his discovery last evening that he 'd put the check and the note into the same envelope , he 'd felt like a trapped animal , leaping wildly , trying to find a way to escape . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the mailbox . He could visualize the way the edge of it had been sticking out of the slot . He might be able to retrieve it . It was a one-in-a-million chance . Common sense told him that if the postman had brought132 133Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One Sleepsmore mail , he probably shoved that envelope down . But the possibility still allured him , offering the only course of action . He turned up Ethel 's block , his eyes skimming the passersby , hoping he would not encounter the familiar faces of any of Ethel 's neighbors . As he reached her building , his sense of hopeless misery swelled to the point of despair . He could n't even try to steal a letter without bungling it . You needed a key to get into the vestibule where the mailboxes were located . Last night that obnoxious kid had opened the door for him . Now he 'd have to ring for the superintendent , and the super certainly would n't let him fool with Ethel 's mailbox . He was in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the left . There were a dozen steps up to the main entrance . As he stood , uncertain what to do , the fourth-floor window opened . A woman leaned out . Over her shoulder , he could see the face of ' the kid he 'd talked to yesterday . " She has n't been around all week , " a strident voice told him . " And listen , I almost called the cops last Thursday when I heard you shouting at her . " Seamus turned and fled . His breath came in harsh gasps as he ran unseeingly down West End Avenue . He did not stop until he was safely inside his own apartment and had bolted the door . Only then was he aware of the pounding of his heart , the shuddering sound of his struggle for oxygen . To his dismay , he heard footsteps in the hallway coming from the bedroom . Ruth was home already . Urgently he wiped his face with his hand , tried to pull himself together . Ruth did not seem to notice his agitation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was going to drop this at the cleaners , " she told him . Will you kindly tell me why in the name of God you have a one-hundreddollarbill in the pocket ? " Jack Campbell stayed in his office for nearly two hours after Neeve left him . But the manuscript which had been messengered to him with an enthusiastic note from an agent he trusted simply could not hold his attention . After valiant efforts to become involved in the story line , he finally shoved it aside with rare irritability . The anger was directed at himself . It was n't fair to judge someone 's hard work when your mind was ninety-nine percent preoccupied . Neeve Kearny . Funny how six years ago he 'd had that moment of regret that he had n't managed to get her phone number . He 'd even looked it up in the Manhattan directory when he was in New York some months later . There were pages of Kearnys in the book . None of them Neeve . She 'd said something about a dress shop . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugged and put it in the back of his mind . For all he knew she had a live-in boyfriend . But for some reason he 'd never quite forgotten her . At the cocktail party , when she approached him , he 'd recognizedher immediately . She was n't a twenty-one-year-old kid in a ski sweater anymore . She was a sophisticated , fashionably dressed young woman . But that coal-black hair , the milk-white skin , the enormous brown eyes , the dotting of freckles across the bridge of her nose  --  all these were the same. 134 135Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One SleepsNow Jack found himself wondering whether she had a serious involvement . If not .. . At six o'clock his assistant poked her head in . " I 've had it , " she announced . " Is it okay if I warn you that you 'll wreck it for everyone else if you keep late hours ? " Jack shoved aside the unread manuscript and got up . " I 'm on my way , " he said . " Just one question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He mulled over the answer on the walk uptown to his rental apartment on Central Park South . Neeve Kearny had a sensationally successful boutique . Ginny bought her special outfits there . Neeve was well liked , well respected . Neeve had caused an uproar a few months ago when she pulled the plug on a designer who had kids sewing in sweatshops . Neeve could be a fighter . He 'd also asked about Ethel Lambston . Ginny had rolled her eyes . " Do n't get me started . " Jack stopped in his apartment long enough to be sure that he did n't feel like fixing his own dinner . Instead he decided that pasta at Nicola 's was the right way to go . Nicola 's was on Eighty-fourth Street between Lexington and Third . It was a good decision . As always , there was a line for tables , but after one drink at the bar his favorite waiter , Lou , tapped his shoulder . " All set , Mr. Campbell . " Jack found himself relaxing at last over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with frutti di mare . When he ordered a double espresso he also asked for his check . As he left the restaurant , he shrugged . He had known all evening that he was going to walk over to Madison Avenue and see Neeve 's Place . A few minutes later , as anow cooling breeze made him aware that it was still April and that early-spring weather could be capricious , he studied the elegantly dressed windows . He liked what he saw . The delicately feminine soft print dresses and matching umbrellas . The assured poses of the mannequins , the almost arrogant tilt of their heads . Somehow he was sure that Neeve was making a statement with this combination of strength and softness . But carefully studying the window display made him aware of the elusive thought that had evaded him when he was trying to tell Neeve exactly what Ethel had pitched to him . " There 's gossip ; there 's excitement ; there 's universalityin fashion , " Ethel had told him in that hurried , breathless way of hers . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can give you a lot more than that . A bombshell . TNT . " He 'd been late for an appointment . He 'd cut her off . " Send me an outline . " Ethel 's insistent , persistent refusal to be dismissed . " How much is a blockbuster scandal worth ? " His almost joking " If it 's sensational enough , mid  --  six figures . " Jack stared at the mannequins holding their parasollikeumbrellas . His eyes shifted to the ivory-and-blue canopy with the scrolled letters , " Neeve 's Place . " Tomorrowhe could call Neeve and tell her exactly what Ethel had said . As he turned down Madison Avenue , once again findingit necessary to walk off the vague , undefined restlessness , he thought , I 'm really reaching for an excuse . Why not just ask her out ? At that moment , he was able to define the cause of the ' 136 : r4. , 137 IMary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One Sleepsrestlessness . He absolutely did not want to hear that Neeve was involved with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conway . From nine in the morning till noon she drove elderly people to doctors ' appointments . In the afternoon she worked as a volunteerin the small sales shop of the Garden State Museum . Both activities gave her a sense of doing something useful . Long ago in college she had studied anthropology with some vague idea of becoming a second Margaret Mead . Then she 'd met Mike . Now as she helped a sixteen-yearoldselect a replica of an Egyptian necklace , she thought that maybe in the summer she 'd sign up for an anthropologytour . The prospect was intriguing . As she drove home in the April evening , Kitty realized that she was getting impatientwith herself . It was time to get on with the business of living . She turned off Lincoln Avenue and smiled as she saw her house perched high at the bend of Grand View Circle , an impressive white colonial with black shutters . Inside she walked through the downstairs rooms turningon lights , then lit the gas-fueled fireplace in the den . When Michael was alive , he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kindling and feeding the flames regularly so that the hickory scent of the wood filled the room . No matter how she tried , Kitty could n't get a fire started properly , and with apologies to Michael 's memory she had had the gas jet installed. 138She went upstairs to the master bedroom that she 'd redone in apricot and pale green , a pattern copied from a museum tapestry . Peeling off her two-piece gray wool dress , she debated about showering now and getting comfortable in pajamas and a robe . Bad habit , she told herself . It 's only six o'clock . Instead she pulled a teal-blue sweatsuit from the closet and reached for sneakers . " I 'm back to jogging as of right now , " she told herself . She followed her usual path . Grand View to Lincoln Avenue , a mile into town , circle the bus station and back home . Feeling pleasantly virtuous , she dropped her sweatsuit and underwear into the bathroom hamper , showered , slipped on lounging pajamas and studied herself in the mirror . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lines around her eyes were n't deep . Her hair looked pretty natural . The colorist in the beauty parlor had managed to match her own shade of red . Not bad , Kitty told her reflection , but ye gods , in two years I 'll be sixty . It was time for the seven-o'clock news and obviously time for a sherry . Kitty walked across the bedroom toward the hallway and realized she 'd left the bathroom lights blazing . Waste not , want not , and anyhow you should conserve electricity . She hurried back and reached for the bathroom light switch . Her fingers turned numb . The sleeve of her blue sweatsuit was danglingfrom the hamper . Fear , like a cold blade of steel , made Kitty 's throat constrict . Her lips went dry . She could feel the hairs on her neck bristle and tighten . That sleeve . There should be a hand on it . Yesterday . When139Mary Higgins Clark the horse bolted . That scrap of plastic that had hit her face . That blurred image of blue cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had seen a hand . Kitty did not remember to turn on the seven-o'clock news . Instead , she sat in front of the fire , hunched for- ward on the couch , sipping the sherry . Neither the fire nor the sherry could ease the chill that was engulfing her body . Should she call the police ? Suppose she was wrong . She 'd look like a fool . I 'm not wrong , she told herself , but I 'll wait until to- morrow . I 'll drive back to the park and walk down that embankment . That was a hand I saw , but whoever it be- longs to is beyond help now . " You say Ethel 's nephew is in the apartment ? " Myles asked as he filled the ice bucket . " So he borrowed some money and then put it back . It 's been known to happen . " Once again , Myles 's reasonable explanation of the cir- cumstances surrounding Ethel 's absence , her winter coats and now the hundred-dollar bills made Neeve feel slightly foolish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her meeting with Jack Campbell . When she arrived home , she 'd changed into blue silk slacks and a matching long-sleeved blouse . She 'd expected Myles to say , " Pretty fancy for slinging hash . " Instead his eyes had softened when she came into the kitchen , and he 'd remarked , " Your mother always looked lovely in blue . You grow more like her as you get older . " Neeve reached for Renata 's cookbook . She was serving thinly sliced ham with melon , pasta with pesto , sole stuffed with shrimp , a melange of baby vegetables , fu1 arugula-and-endive salad , cheese and a tulip pastry . She flipped through the book until she reached the page with the sketches . Again she avoided looking at them . Instead she concentrated on the handwritten instructionsRenata had scrawled over the baking time for the sole . Deciding she was fully organized , she went over to the refrigerator and took out a jar of caviar . Myles watched as she put toast points on a platter . " I never developed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very plebeian of me , I know . " " You 're hardly plebeian . " Neeve scooped caviar onto a sliver of toast point . " But you 're missing a lot . " She studiedhim . He was wearing a navy jacket , gray slacks , a light-blue shirt and a handsome red-and-blue tie she had given him for Christmas . A good-looking guy , she thought , and best of all , you 'd never dream he 'd been so sick . She told him that . Myles reached over and gingerly popped a caviar toast point into his mouth . " I still do n't like it , " he commented , then added , " I do feel well. , and inactivity is getting on my nerves . I had some feelers about heading up the Drug Enforcement Agency in Washington . It would mean spending most of my time there . What do you think ? " Neeve gasped and threw her arms around him . " That 's wonderful . Go for it . You could really get your teeth into that job . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Brie into the living room . Now if only Ethel Lambston140Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One Sleepscould be tracked down . She was just in the process of wondering how long it would be before Jack Campbell phoned her when the doorbell rang . Their two guests had arrived together . Bishop Devin Stanton was one of the few prelates who at private functions still seemed more comfortable in a Roman collar than a sports jacket . Traces of now subdued copper-color hair mingled with gray . Behind silverrimmedglasses , his mild blue eyes radiated warmth and intelligence . His tall , thin body gave an impression of quicksilver when he moved . Neeve always had the uncomfortableimpression that Dev could read her mind and the comfortable reaction that he liked what he read . She kissed him warmly . Once again , Anthony della Salva was resplendent in one of his own creations . He was wearing a charcoal-gray suit of Italian silk . The elegant lines masked the additionalweight that had begun creeping onto his always rotund body . Neeve remembered Myles 's observation that Sal reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that suited him . His black hair untouched by gray glistened , matching the gloss of his Gucci loafers . It was second nature for Neeve to calculate the cost of clothes . She decided that Sal 's suit would retail for about flftee  --  hundred dollars . As usual , Sal was bursting with good humor . " Dev , . Myles , Neeve , my three favorite people , not counting my ' present girlfriend but certainly counting my ex-wives . Dev , do you think Mother Church will take me back in when I get old ? " " The prodigal son is supposed to return repentant and in rags , " the Bishop observed dryly . Myles laughed and put his arms around the shoulders of both his friends . " God , it 's good to get together with you two . I feel as though we 're back in the Bronx . Are you still drinking Absolut vodka or have you found something more trendy ? " The evening began in the usual pleasantly comfortable fashion that had become a ritual . A debate about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not together that much " from the Bishop , " I 'd better stop " from Myles , a nonchalant " Of course " from Sal . The conversation veered from present-day politics , " Could the Mayor win again ? " to problems of the Church , " You ca n't educate a kid in a parochial school for less than sixteen hundred dollars a year . God , remember when we were at St. FrancisXavier and our parents paid a buck a month ? The parish carried the school on Bingo games , " to Sal 's lamentsabout the foreign imports , " Sure , we should use the union label , but we can get the clothes made in Korea and Hong Kong for a third of the price . If we do n't farm some of it out , we outprice ourselves . If we do , we 're union busters , " to Myles 's dry comment , " I still think we do n't know the half of how much mob money is on SeventhAvenue . " Inevitably it turned to Nicky Sepetti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dying in bed , " Sal commented , the jovial expression gone from his face . " After what he did to your pretty one . " Neeve watched as Myles 's lips tightened . Long ago Sal had heard Myles teasingly call Renata " my pretty one " and , to Myles 's annoyance , had picked it up . " How 's the pretty one ? " he would greet Renata . Neeve could still remember the moment at Renata 's wake when Sal had142 143Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One Sleepsknelt at the casket , his eyes flowing with tears , then gottenup , embraced Myles and said , " Try to think your pretty one is sleeping . " Myles had said flatly , " She 's not sleeping . She 's dead . And , Sal , do n't call her that again ever . That was my name for her . " Till now he never had . There was a moment of awkwardsilence , then Sal gulped the rest of his martini and stood up . " Be right back , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guest bathroom . Devin sighed . " He may be a genius designer , but he still has more spit than polish . " " He also gave me my start , " Neeve reminded them . " If it were n't for Sal , I 'd probably be an assistant buyer in Bloomingdale 's right now . " She saw the look on Myles 's face and warned , " Do n't tell me I 'd be better off . " " That never crossed my mind . " When she served dinner , Neeve lit the candles and muted the overhead chandelier . The room was softly shadowed . Each course was pronounced excellent . Myles and the Bishop had seconds of everything . Sal had thirds . " So forget the diet , " he said . " This is the best kitchen in Manhattan . " Over dessert inevitably the talk turned to Renata . " This is one of her recipes , " Neeve told them . " Prepared especially for you two . I 've really just started getting into her cookbooks , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heading up the Drug Enforcement Agency . " I may be keeping you company in the Washington144area , " Devin said with a smile , then added , " strictly off the record . " Sal insisted on helping Neeve clear the table and volunteered to prepare the espresso . As he busied himself with the espresso machine , Neeve took from the breakfrontthe exquisite gold-and-green demitasse cups that had been in the Rossetti family for generations . The sound of a thud and a cry of pain made them rush to the kitchen . The espresso pot had toppled over , floodingthe counter and soaking Renata 's cookbook . Sal was running his fiery-red hand under cold water . His face was ghastly white . " The handle on that damn pot came off . " He tried to sound nonchalant . " Myles , I think you 're trying to get back at me for breaking your arm when we were kids . " It was obvious the burn was nasty and painful . Neeve scrambled for the eucalyptus leaves Myles alwayskept for burn emergencies . She patted Sal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then wrapped it in a  --  soft linen napkin . The Bishop righted the demitasse pot and began mopping up . Myles was drying the cookbook . Neeve saw the expression in his eyes as he studied Renata'ssketches , which were now thoroughly soaked and stained . Sal noticed as well . He pulled his hand from Neeve 's ministrations . " Myles , for God 's sake , I 'm sorry . " Myles held the book over the sink , drained the puddles of coffee from it and , covering it with a towel , laid it carefully on top of the refrigerator . " What the hell have you got to be sorry about ? Neeve , I never saw that damn coffeemaker before . When did you get it ? " 145Neeve began to make fresh espresso in the old pot . " It was a gift , " she said reluctantly . " Ethel Lambston sent it to you for Christmas after she was here for the party . " Devin Stanton looked bewildered as Myles , Neeve and Sal burst into wry laughter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace , " Neeve said . " My God , no matter what I do , I ca n't lose Ethel even for the space of a dinner . " Over espresso and Sambuca , she told about Ethel 's apparentdisappearance . Myles 's comment was , " As long as she stays out of sight . " Trying not to wince at the pain in his rapidly blistering hand , Sal poured a second Sambuca and said , " There is n't a designer on Seventh Avenue she has n't bugged about that article . To answer your question , Neeve , she phoned me last week and insisted on being put through . We were in the middle of a meeting . She had a couple of questions like Was it true you had the school record for playing hookey at Christopher Columbus High School ? ' " Neeve stared at him . " You 've got to be joking . " " No joke at all . My guess is Ethel 's article is to debunk all the stories we designers pay publicists to grind out about us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but tell me it 's worth half a million bucks for a book ! It boggles my mind . " Neeve was about to volunteer that Ethel was n't actually offered the advance , then bit her tongue . Jack Campbell had obviously not meant that to get around . " By the way , " Sal added , " the word is that your tipWhile My Pretty One Sleepsabout Steuber 's sweatshops is really turning up a lot of dirt . Neeve , stay way from that guy . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " Myles asked sharply . Neeve had not told Myles about the rumor that , becauseof her , Gordon Steuber might be indicted . She shook her head at Sal as she said , " He 's a designer I stopped buying from because of the way he does business . " She appealed to Sal , " I still say there 's something wrong about the way Ethel dropped out of sight . You know she bought all her clothes from me , and every singleone of her winter coats is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll be honest , Ethel 's such a flake she probably ran out without a coat and never noticedit . Watch and see . She 'll show up in something she bought off the rack at J. C. Penney 's . " Myles laughed . Neeve shook her head . " You 're a big help . " Before they left the table , Devin Stanton offered grace . " We thank Thee , Lord , for good friendship , for the deliciousmeal , for the beautiful young woman who prepared it , and we ask you to bless the memory of Renata whom we all loved . " " Thank you , Dev . " Myles touched the Bishop 's hand . Then he laughed . " And if she were here , she 'd be telling you to clean up her kitchen , Sal , because you made the mess . " When the Bishop and Sal had left , Neeve and Myles stacked the dishwasher and washed the pots and pans in companionable silence . Neeve picked up the offending espresso pot . " Might as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she observed. 147Mary Higgins Clark " No , leave it alone , " Myles told her . " It looks expensive enough , and I can fix it someday when I 'm watching Jeopardy . " Jeopardy . To Neeve the word seemed to hang in the air . Shaking her head impatiently at the thought , she turned off the kitchen light and kissed Myles good night . She glanced around to be sure everything was in order . The light from the foyer shone faintly into the den , and Neeve winced as she watched it fall on the blistered , smeared pages of Renata 's cookbook , which Myles had placed on the top of his desk . On Friday morning , Ruth Lambston left theapartment while Seamus was shaving . She didnot say goodbye to him . The memory of the way his face had convulsed in anger when she held outthe hundred-dollar bill to him was imprinted on hermind . In these last years , the monthly alimony checkhad choked off every emotion she felt for him except114R149Mary Higgins Clarkresentment . Now a new emotion had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? She did n't know . Ruth made twenty-six thousand dollars a year as a secretary . With taxes and Social Security taken out and her expenses for carfare and clothes and lunches , she estimated that her net earnings three days a week just about made up Ethel 's alimony . " I 'm slaving for that harridan " was a sentence that she regularly threw at Seamus . Usually Seamus tried to soothe her . But last night his face had convulsed in rage . He 'd raised his fist and for a moment she 'd flinched , sure he was going to hit her . But he 'd snatched the hundred-dollar bill and torn it in half . " You want to know where I got it ? " he 'd shouted . " That bitch gave it to me . When I asked her to let me off the hook , she told me that she 'd be glad to help me . She 'd been too busy to eat out much , so this was left over from last month . " " Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ruth cried . The anger on his face had turned to hatred . " Maybe I convinced her that any human being can take just so much . Maybe it 's something you ought to learn , too . " The answer had left Ruth in a temper that still made her breath come in sharp , harsh gasps . " Do n't you dare threaten me , " she 'd shouted and then watched horrified as Seamus burst into tears . Sobbing , he told her how he 'd put the check with the letter , how the kid who lived upstairs from Ethel had talked about his delivering the ransom . " Her whole building thinks I 'm a joke . " All night Ruth had lain awake in one of the girls ' bedrooms , so filled with contempt for Seamus that she could1150While My Pretty One Sleepsnot endure the thought of being near him . Toward morn-ingshe realized that the contempt was for herself as well . That woman has turned me into a shrew , she thought . It 's got to end . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as , instead of turning right toward Broadway and the subway I ! , station , she walked straight up West End Avenue . There was a sharp early-morning breeze , but her low-heeled shoes made it possible to move quickly . She was going to confront Ethel . She should have done it years ago . She 'd read enough of Ethel 's articles to know that Ethel postured herself as a feminist . But now that she 'd signed a big book contract , she really was vulnerable . Page Six of the Post would love to print that she was gouging one thousand dollars a month from a man with three daughters in college . Ruth permitted herself a grim smile . If Ethel did n't surrender her alimony rights , Ruth would go for her throat . First the Post . Then court . She 'd gone to the personnel office of her company for an emergency loan to cover the tuition cheek . The personneldirector had been shocked to learn about the alimony . " I 've got a friend who 's a good matrimonial lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do pro-bono work and she 'd love to have a case like this . The way I understand it , you ca n't break an irrevocable alimony agreement , but it might be about time to test the law . If you get public outrage going , things might happen . " Ruth had hesitated . " I do n't want to embarrass the girls . It would mean admitting the bar is barely making enough money to keep the doors open . Let me think about it . " 151Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One SleepsAs she crossed Seventy-third Street , Ruth thought , Either she gives up the alimony or I see that lawyer . A young woman with a child in a stroller was bearing down on her . Ruth stepped to one side to avoid her and collided with a thin-faced man in a cap that almost coveredhis face and a filthy overcoat that smelled of stale wine . Wrinkling her nose in disgust , she clutched her pocketbook and scurried to the opposite curb . The sidewalkswere so crowded , she thought . Kids rushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk to the newsstand , people on the way to work trying to flag down cabs . Ruth had never forgotten the house they 'd almost bought in Westchester twenty years ago . Thirty-five thousand dollars then and must be worth ten times that now . When the bank saw the alimony payments , the mortgage had n't been approved . She turned east on Eighty-second Street , Ethel 's block . Squaring her shoulders , Ruth adjusted her rimless glasses , unconsciously preparing herself like a fighter about to enter the ring . Seamus had told her that Ethel had the ground-floor apartment with its own entrance . The name over the bell , " E. Lambston , " confirmed that fact . From inside she could hear the faint sounds of a radio playing . She pressed her index finger firmly on the bell . But there was no response to her first or second ring . Ruth was not to be dissuaded . The third time she rang the bell , she pressed relentlessly . The loud ringing went on for fully a minute before she was rewarded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . A young man , his hair tousled , his shirt still unbuttoned , glared at her . " What the hell do you want ? " he asked . Then he made a visible attempt to calm down . " I 'm sorry . Are you a friend of Aunt Ethel 's ? " " Yes , and I must see her . " Ruth moved forward , forcing the young man to block her way or let her pass . He stepped back , and she was in the living room . Quickly she glanced around . Seamus always talked about Ethel 's messy housekeeping , but this place was spotless . Too many papers around , but they were stacked in neat piles . Fine antique furniture . Seamus had told her about the pieces he had bought for Ethel . And I live with those overstuffed horrors , Ruth thought . " I 'm Douglas Brown . " Doug felt clammy apprehension . There was something about this woman , about the way she was sizing up the apartment , that made him nervous . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you have an appointment with her ? " " No . But I insist on seeing her immediately . " Ruth introducedherself . " I 'm Seamus Larnbston 's wife and I 'm here to collect the last check he gave your aunt . As of now there 's no more alimony being paid . " There was a stack of mail on the desk . Near the top of the pile , she saw a white envelope with maroon edging , the stationery the girls had given Seamus for his birthday . " I 'll take that , " she said . Before Doug could stop her , the envelope was in her hand . She ripped it open and pulled out the contents . Scanning them , she shredded the check and returned the note to the envelope . As Doug Brown stared , too startled to protest , shei 152 153 1Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One Sleepsreached into her purse and extracted the pieces of the hundred-dollar bill Seamus had torn . " She is n't here , I gather , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doug snapped . " I could have you arrested for this . " " I would n't try , " Ruth told him . " Here . " She shoved the torn pieces of the bill into his hand . " You tell that parasite to tape this together and have her final fancy dinner on my husband . Tell her she 's not getting another nickel from us and if she tries she 'll regret it with every breath she draws for the rest of her life . " Ruth did not give Doug a chance to answer . Instead she walked over to the wall where Ethel 's pictures were displayed and studied them . " She postures herself as doing good for all kinds of vague , undefined causes and goes around accepting her damn awards , and yet the one person who ever tried to treat her as a woman , as a human being , she 's hounding to his grave . " Ruth turned to face Doug . " I think she 's despicable . I know what she thinks of you . You eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our children are paying for , and , not satisfied with that , you steal from that woman . Ethel told my husband about you . I can only say , you deserve each other . " She was gone . His lips ashen , Doug collapsed onto the couch . Whom else had Ethel , with her big mouth , told about his habit of helping himself to her alimony loot ? When Ruth stepped onto the sidewalk she was hailed by a woman standing on the stoop of the brownstone . She looked to be in her early forties . Ruth observed that herblond hair was fashionably messy , that her pullover sweater and narrow slacks were trendy , and that her expression could only be described as one of unrestrainedcuriosity . " I 'm sorry to bother you , " the woman said , " but I 'm Georgette Wells , Ethel 's neighbor , and I 'm worried about her . " A thin teenager pushed open the house door , clattered down the steps and stood beside Wells . Her sharp eyes looked over Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ethel 's apartment . " You a friend of Ms. Lambston ? " she asked . Ruth was sure that this was the girl who had taunted Seamus . Intense dislike combined with cold , sinking dread to congeal her stomach muscles . Why was this woman worried about Ethel ? She thought of the murderousfury on Seamus ' face when he talked about Ethel 's thrusting the hundred-dollar bill into his pocket . She thought of the tidy apartment she had just left . How many times over the years had Seamus told her that all Ethel had to do was walk into a room and it was as though the nuclear bomb hit it ? Ethel had not been in that apartment recently . " Yes , " Ruth said , trying to sound pleasant . " I 'm surprisedEthel is n't in , but is there any reason to worry ? " " Dana , get to school , " her mother ordered . " You 'll be late again . " Dana pouted . " I want to hear . " " All right , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ruth . " There 's something funny going on . Last week Ethel had a visit from her ex . Usually he only comes on the fifth of the month if he has n't mailed the alimony. 154Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One SleepsSo when I saw him sneaking around last Thursday afternoon , I thought something was funny . I mean it was only the thirtieth , so why should he pay her early ? Well , let me tell you , they had a battle royal ! I could hear them shouting at each other like I was in the room . " Ruth managed to keep her voice steady . " What were they saying ? " " Well , what I mean is I could hear shouting sounds . I could n't hear what they were saying . I started to come downstairs just in case Ethel might be in trouble ... " No , you wanted to hear better , Ruth thought. ... but then my phone rang and it was my mother calling from Cleveland about my sister 's divorce , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the fight was over . I phoned Ethel . She 's really funny about her ex . Her imitation of him is priceless , you know ? But she did n't answer , so I figured she 'd gone out . You know the kind of person Ethel is  --  always rushing somewhere . But she usually tells me if she 's going to be away for more than a couple of days , and she did n't say a word . Now her nephew is staying at the apartment and that 's funny , too . " Georgette Wells folded her arms . " Kind of cold , is n't it ? Crazy weather . All that hair spray in the ozone , I guess . Anyhow , " she continued as Ruth stared at her and Dana hung on every word , " I have a very funny feeling that something happened to Ethel , and that wimp of an exhusbandof hers had something to do with it . " " And do n't forget , Mama , " Dana interrupted , " he came back on Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was going to get to that . You saw him Wednesday . That was the fifth , so that means he was probably deliveringthe check . Then I saw him yesterday . Will you tell me why he came back ? But nobody 's seen Ethel . Now , the way I figure it , he might have done something to her and maybe left a clue that 's worrying him . " Georgette Wells smiled triumphantly , her story completed . " As a good friend of Ethel 's , " she asked Ruth , " help me decide . Should I call the police and tell them I think my neighbormay have been murdered ? " On Friday morning , Kitty Conway received a call from the hospital . One of the volunteer drivers was sick . Could she possibly fill in ? It was late afternoon before she was able to go home , change to a jogging suit and sneakers and head her car in the direction of Morrison State Park . The shadows were getting longer , and on the way she debated with herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she reached the park . The sunshine of the past few days had dried the macadam surface of the parkinglot and the footpaths that arteried from it , but the heavily wooded areas were still damp underfoot . Kitty walked to the perimeter of the stable , attempting to follow the trail that would retrace the route from which the horse had bolted forty-eight hours ago . But , to her chagrin , she realized that she was totally unsure which trail to follow . " Absolutely no sense of direction , " she muttered as a branch slapped her face . She remembered that Mike used to draw painstaking sketches showingcrossroads and landmarks whenever she drove alone to an unfamiliar place. i 156 1 157 1Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One SleepsAfter forty wasted minutes , her sneakers were muddy and soaked , her legs were aching and she had accom- plished nothing . She stopped to rest at a clearing where the riding classes from the stable would pause and re- group . There were no other hikers around and she could not hear any sounds of riders on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must be crazy , she thought . This is no place to be alone . 1 ' 11 come back tomorrow . She got up and began to retrace her steps . Wait a min- ute , she thought , it was just past here . We took the fork on the right and went up that incline . Somewhere along there is where that damn nag decided to take off . She knew she was right . A sense of ' anticipation com- hined with mounting dread made her heart pound fu- riously . During the sleepless night , her mind had been an out-of-control pendulum . She had seen a hand ... She should call the police . . . Ridiculous . It was all her imagination . She 'd look like a fool . She should make an anonymous call and stay out of it . No . Suppose she was right and they traced the call somehow . In the end she returned to the original plan . Look for herself . It took twenty minutes to cover the ground the horses had made in five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating all the junk-food weeds , " she remembered . " I tugged the reins and it turned and went straight down here . " " Here " was a steep rocky incline . In the gathering dark- ness , Kitty began to make her way down it . The rocks slid out from under her sneakers . Once she lost her balance and fell , scraping her hand . I really need this , she thought . Even though it was very cool , beads of perspira- tion were forming on her forehead . She wiped them away with a hand now soiled from the loose dirt between the rocks . There was no sign of a blue sleeve . Halfway down she came to a large rock and paused to rest on it . I was crazy , she decided . Thank God I did n't make a perfect fool of myself by calling the police . She 'd catch her breath and get home to a hot shower . " Why anybody thinks hiking is fun is beyond me , " she said aloud . When her breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jogging suit . She grasped the side of the rock with her right hand as she prepared to hoist herself up . And felt something . Kitty looked down . She tried to scream , but no sound came , only a low , disbelieving moan . Her fingers were touching other fingers , manicured , with deep-red polish , help upward by the rocks that had slid around them , framed by the blue cuff that had intruded upon her subconscious , a scrap of black plastic , like a mourning band , embracing the slender inert wrist . Denny Adler , in the guise of a wino , settled at seven o'clock on Friday morning against an apartment building directly across from Schwab House . It was still raw and breezy and he realized the odds were against Neeve Kearny walking to work . But long ago when he was trackingsomeone he had learned to be patient . Big Charley had said that Kearny usually left for her shop pretty early , somewhere between seven-thirty and eight . At about quarter of eight , the exodus started . Kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those fancy private schools . I went to a private school , too , Denny thought . Brownsville Reformatory in New Jersey. 158 159Mary Higgins Clark Yuppies began to pour out . All in identical raincoats  --  no , Burberrys , Denny thought . Get it straight . Then the gray-haired executives , men and women . All sleek and prosperous-looking . From where he was positioned , he was able to observe them clearly . At twenty of nine , Denny knew this was n't his day . The one thing he could n't risk was the deli manager getting mad at him . He was sure that with his record , he 'd be pulled in for questioning when he completed the job . But he knew that even his parole officer would go to bat for him . " One of my best men , " Toohey would say . " Never even late for work . He 's clean . " Reluctantly Denny stood up , brushed his hands to- gether and glanced down . He was wearing a filthy loose overcoat that smelled of cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , and sneakers with holes in the sides . What did n't show was that under the coat he was neatly dressed in his work clothes , a faded denim zip-up jacket and matching jeans . He was carrying a shopping bag . It contained his everyday sneakers , a wet washcloth and a towel . A switchblade knife was in the right-hand pocket of the overcoat . His plan was to go to the subway station at Seventy- second and Broadway , make his way to the end of the platform , drop the coat and cap into the shopping bag , change the filthy sneakers for the others , and sponge off his face and hands . If only Kearny had n't stepped into a cab last night ! He could have sworn she was going to walk home . It would have been a great chance to hit her in the park .... Patience born of the absolute certainty that his goal would be achieved , if not this morning , maybe this eve- ning , if not today , maybe tomorrow , sent Denny on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dangle the shoppingbag as though he was hardly aware he was carrying it . The few people who bothered to glance at him edged away , the expression on their faces either disgusted or pitying . As he crossed Seventy-second Street and West End , he collided with an old broad who was walking with her head down , her arm clamped around her pocketbook , her mouth mean and small . It would have been fun to give her a shove and grab that bag , Denny thought , then dismissed the idea . He hurried past her , turned onto Seventy-second Street and headed for the subway station . A few minutes later he emerged , his face and hands clean , his hair slicked down , his faded denim jacket zipped neatly to his neck , the shopping bag containing the coat , cap , towel and washcloth tied into a neat bundle . At ten-thirty he was delivering coffee to Neeve 's office . " Hi , Denny , " she said when he went in . " I overslept this morning and now I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody else in this place says . Your coffee beats the stuff they brew in the coffeemaker . " " We all got ta oversleep once in a while , Miss Kearny , " Denny said as he pulled the container from the bag and solicitously opened it for her . Friday morning when Neeve awakened , she 'd been startledto see that it was quarter to nine . Good Lord , she thought as she tossed back the covers and jumped out of160 161Mary Higgins Clark ' While My Pretty One Sleepsbed , there 's nothing like staying up half the night with the kids from the Bronx . She pulled on her robe and hurried into the kitchen . Myles had the coffee perking , juice poured and English muffins ready to be toasted . " You should have called me , Commish , " she accused . " It wo n't hurt the fashion industry to wait on you for half an hour . " He was deep in the Daily News . Neeve leaned over his shoulder . " Anything exciting ? " " A front-page account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's being buried tomorrow , escorted into eternityfrom a High Mass at St. Camilla 's to interment in Calvary . " " Did you expect them to kick him around until they lost him ? " " No . I was hoping he 'd be cremated and I could bid for the pleasure of sliding the coffin into the furnace . " " Oh , Myles , be quiet . " Neeve tried to change the subject . " Last night was fun , was n't it ? " " It was fun . Wonder how Sal 's hand is . I 'll bet he was n't making love with his latest fiancee last night . Did you hear him say he 's thinking of getting married again ? " Neeve downed the orange juice with an all-in-one vitamin . " You 're kidding . Who 's the lucky lady ? " " I 'm not convinced ' lucky ' is the word , " Myles commented . " He 's certainly had a variety of them . Never marriedtill he made it big , and then runs the gamut from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a health nut . Moves from Westchester to New Jersey to Connecticut to Sneden 's Landing , and leaves them all behind in a fancy house . God knows what it 's cost him over the years . " " Will he ever settle down ? " Neeve asked . " Who knows ? No matter how many bucks he makes , Sal Esposito is always going to be an insecure kid trying to prove himself . " Neeve popped an English muffin into the toaster . " What else did I miss while I was fussing over a hot stove ? " " Dev 's been summoned to the Vatican . That 's just between us . He told me as they were leaving , when Sal went to pee  --  excuse me , your mother forbade me to say that . When Sal went in to wash his hands . " " I heard him say something about Baltimore . The archdiocese there ? " " He thinks it 's coming . " " That could mean a red hat . " " It 's possible . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be something in the air . " The toaster popped . Neeve buttered the English muffin , generously spread it with marmalade and bit into it . Even though the day was obviously going to stay gloomy , the kitchen was cheerful with its white-stained oak cabinetsand ceramic-tile floor in tones of blue , white and green . The place mats on the narrow butcher-block-top table were mint-green linen squares with matching napkins . The cups and saucers and plates and pitcher and creamer were legacies from Myles 's boyhood . The English blue willow pattern . Neeve could n't conceive of starting the day at home without that familiar china . She studied Myles carefully . He really looked like himselfagain . It was n't just Nicky Sepetti . It was the prospect of getting to work , of doing a job that was needed . She knew how Myles deplored the drug traffic and the car-i 162 163 iMary Higgins Clarknage it was causing . And who knows ? In Washington he might meet someone . He should marry again , and God knows he was a good-looking guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing last night , " Myles told her . " I 'm thinking of volunteering to pose for the center- fold of Playgirl . Do you think they 'll take me ? " " If they do , bimbos will be lining up to seduce you , " Neeve told him as she took her coffee back to her room , deciding it was high time to get a move on and go to work . When he came out from shaving , Seamus realized that Ruth had left the apartment . For a moment he stood irresolute , then lumbered across the foyer into the bed- room , untied the cord of the maroon terry-cloth bathrobe the girls had given him for Christmas , and sank down on the bed . The sense of fatigue was so overwhelming that he could barely keep his eyes open . All he wanted to do was get back into bed , pull the covers over his head and sleep and sleep and sleep . In all these years with all the problems , Ruth had never not slept with him . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without touching each other , so strained with the money worries that their guts were torn out , but even so , by mutual unspoken consent they had lain together , both of them bound by the tradition that a woman slept at her husband 's side . Seamus looked around the room , seeing it through Ruth 's eyes . The bedroom furniture that his mother had bought when he was ten . Not antique , just old  --  mahog- any veneer , the mirror veering crazily on the supporting164While My Pretty One Sleepsposts over the dresser . He could remember how his mother polished that piece of furniture , fussing over it , rejoicing in it . For her the matching set , the bed , dresser and chest , had been an accomplishment , the realized goal of a " nice home . " Ruth used to cut pictures from House Beautiful of the kind of rooms she 'd like to have . Modern furniture . Pastel shades . Airy open look . Money worries had squeezed hope and brightness from her face , had made her too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd shrieked at Marcy , " What do you mean you tore your dress ? I saved for that dress . " All because of Ethel . Seamus leaned his head on his hands . The phone call gyp he had made lay on his conscience . No way out . That had jl been the title of a movie a couple of years ago . No Way Ill Out . Last night he 'd almost hit Ruth . The memory of those last few minutes with Ethel , the exact moment when he 'd lost all control , when he 'd .. . He slumped back on the pillow . What was the point of going to the bar , of trying to keep up a front ? He 'd taken a step he would n't have believed possible . It was too late to call it off . He knew that . And it would n't do any good . He knew that too . He closed his eyes . He was n't aware that he 'd dozed off , but suddenly Ruth ; ! il was there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The anger seemed to have drained from her face . She looked haunted and panic-stricken , like someone facing a tiring squad . " Seamus , " she said , " you 've got to tell me everything . What did you do to her ? " 165Mary Higgins ClarkGordon Steuber arrived at his office on West ThirtyseventhStreet at ten o'clock on Friday morning . He had come up in the elevator with three conservatively dressed men whom he instantly recognized as government auditorsreturning to pore over his books . His staff had only to see the scowl that made his eyebrows meet , the angry stride , to have the word begin to spread . " Watch out ! " He cut through the showroom , ignoring both clients and employees , walked rapidly past his secretary 's desk , not deigning to respond to May 's timid " Good morning , sir , " and entered his private office , slamming the door behind him . When he sat at his desk and leaned back in the ornate morocco leather chair that always inspired admiring comments , the scowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around the office , drinking in the atmospherehe had created for himself : the tooled-leather couches and chairs ; the paintings that had cost a king 's ransom ; the sculptures that his art consultant assured him were of museum quality .. Thanks to Neeve Kearny , there was a damn good chance he 'd be spending more time in court than in his office . Or prison , he reflected , if he was n't careful . Steuber got up and walked over to the window . ThirtyseventhStreet . The frantic atmosphere of the street peddler . It still had that quality . He remembered how as a kid he 'd come directly from school to work for his father , a furrier . Cheap furs . The kind that made I. J. Fox creations look like sables . His father declared bankruptcy166While My Pretty One Sleepsevery couple of years like clockwork . By the time he was fifteen , Gordon knew he was n't going to spend his life sneezing over rabbit hairs , talking dopes into thinking they looked good in mangy animal skins . Linings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shave . The one constant . Whether you sold a jacket , a IL full-length , a fingertip , a stole or a cape , it had to be lined . That simple realization together with a grudging loan from his father had been the beginning of Steuber Enterprises . The kids he 'd hired fresh from FIT or Rhode IslandSchool of Design had imagination and flair . His linings with their exciting patterns had caught on . But linings did n't make you a byword in a business that hungered for recognition . That was when he started looking for kids who knew how to design suits . He madeit his ambition to be the new Chanel. i ; iOnce again he 'd succeeded . His suits were in the best stores . But he was one of a dozen , two dozen , all competingfor the same upscale customer . Not enough money there . Steuber reached for a cigarette . His gold lighter with his initials blazoned in rubies was on his desk . For an instant after he lit the cigarette , he held the lighter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feds had to do was add up how much the contents of this room and this lighter had cost and they 'd keep digging till they had enough to indict him on income-tax evasion . It was the damn unions that kept you from making a real profit , he told himself . Everyone knew that . Every time Steuber saw the ILGWU commercial he wanted to ii throw something at the television set . All they wanted was more money . Stop all the importing . Hire us. 167Mary Higgins Clark : While My Pretty One Sleeps It was only three years ago that he 'd started doing what the rest of them did , set up off-the-books places for im- migrants without green cards . Why not ? The Mexicans were good seamstresses . And then he 'd found where the real money lay . He 'd been all set to close out the sweatshops when Neeve Kearny blew the whistle on him . Then that crazy Ethel Lambston had started snooping around . He could still see that bitch bursting in here last week , last Wednesday evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd thrown her out , literally taken her shoulders and shoved her across the showroom to the main door , pushed her so she stumbled against the elevator . Even that had n't fazed her . As he slammed the door , she 'd shouted , " In case you have n't found out yet , they 're going to get you on income tax as well as sweatshops . And that 's just for starters . I know how you 've been lining your pockets . " He 'd known then that he could n't let her keep digging into his affairs . She had to be stopped . The phone rang , a soft purring sound . Annoyed , Gor- don picked it up . " What is it , May ? " His secretary sounded apologetic . " I knew you would n't want to be disturbed , sir , but the agents from the United States Attorney 's office insist on seeing you . " " Send them in . " Steuber smoothed the jacket of his light-beige Italian silk suit , flicked a handkerchief over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his desk chair . As the three agents came in , professional and buss- nesslike in their attitude , he remembered for the tenth time in the last hour that all this had begun because Neeve Kearny had blown the whistle on his illegal factories . At eleven o'clock on Friday morning , Jack Campbell returned from a staff meeting and again attacked the manuscript he had meant to read the night before . This time he forced himself to concentrate on the spicy adventuresof a prominent thirty-three-year-old psychiatrist who falls in love with her client , an over-the-hill film idol . They go off to St. Martin 's together on a clandestine vacation . The film idol because of his long and lusty experience with women breaks down the barriers the psychiatristhas built around her femininity . In turn , after three weeks of unending coupling under starry skies , she rebuilds his confidence in himself . He goes back to Los Angeles to accept the role as grandfather in a new situationcomedy .

" Oh my God , Jack thought as he skimmed through the final pages . He tossed the manuscript on his desk , just as Ginny came into the office , a pile of letters in her hand . She nodded in the direction of the manuscript . " How was It ? " " Frightful but it will sell big . Funny , in all those sex scenes in the garden , I kept wondering about love bites from the mosquitos . Is that a sign I 'm getting old ? " Ginny grinned . " I doubt it . You know you have a lunch date ? " 168 169Mary Higgins Clark " I marked it down . " Jack stood up and stretched . Ginny looked at him approvingly . " Do you realize that all the junior editors are twittering about you ? They keep asking me if I 'm sure you 're not involved with someone . " " Tell them you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I were twenty years younger , maybe . " Jack 's smile turned to a frown . " Ginny , I just thought of something . How far ahead is the lead time of ContemporaryWoman ? " " I 'm not sure . Why ? " " I 'm wondering if I can get a copy of the article Ethel Lambston did for them , the one on fashion ? I know Toni usually wo n't show anything before the magazine 's put to bed , but see what you can do , okay ? " " Sure . " An hour later when Jack left for lunch , Ginny called to him . " The article comes out in next week 's issue . Toni said as a favor she 'll let you see it . She 's also going to send Xeroxes of Ethel 's notes . " " That 's great of her .

She says since you 're publishing Ethel 's fashion book , she does n't feel as though she 's breaking confidentiality . " As Jack went down in the elevator on his way to his lunch date , he realized that he was very , very anxious to get a look at the outtakes in Ethel 's file that were too hot to print . While My Pretty One SleepsNeither Seamus nor Ruth went to work on Friday . They sat in the apartment staring at each other like people caught together in quicksand , sinking , unable to reverse the inevitable . At noon , Ruth made strong coffee and grilled-cheese sandwiches . She insisted Seamus get up ji anll dress . " Eat , " she told him , " and tell me again exactly what happened . " As she listened , she could only imagine what it would do to the girls . Her hopes for them . The colleges she 'd scrimped and sacrificed for . The dancing lessons and singing lessons , the clothes so carefully bought at sales . What good if their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . His round face glistening with perspiration , his hands thick and helplessin his lap , he recounted how he had begged Ethel to let him off the hook , how she 'd toyed with him . " Maybe I will and maybe I wo n't , " she 'd said . Then she 'd searched down behind the cushions of the couch . " Let me see if I can find some of the money my nephew forgot to steal , " she told him , laughing , and , finding a hundred-dollar bill , she stuck it into his pocket with the remark that she had n't had much time to eat out this month . " I punched her , " Seamus said tonelessly . " I never knew I was gon na do it . Her head lobbed to one side . She fell backwards . I did n't know if I 'd killed her . She got up and she was scared . I told her if she looked for another dime , I would kill her . She knew I meant it . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Seamus gulped the rest of his coffee . They were sitting in the den . The day had started gray and cold , and now it was like early evening . Gray and cold . Just the way it had been last Thursday , at Ethel 's apartment . The next day170the storm broke . The storm would break again . He was sure of it . " And then you left ? " Ruth prompted . Seamus hesitated . " And then I left . " There was a sense of something unfinished . Ruth looked around the room , at the heavy oak furniture she had despised for twenty years , at the faded machinemadeOriental that she had been forced to live with , and knew that Seamus had not told her the whole truth . She looked down at her hands . Too small . Square . Stubby fingers . All three girls had long , tapering fingers . Genes from whom ? Seamus ? Probably . Her family pictures showed small , square people . But they were strong . And Seamus was weak . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate ? " You have not told me everything , " she said . " I want to know . I have to know . It 's the only way I can help you . His head burrowed in his hands , he told her the rest . " Oh , my God , " Ruth cried . " Oh , my God . " At one o'clock Denny returned to Neeve 's Place carrying a cardboard tray containing two tuna-fish sandwiches and coffee . Again the receptionist waved him toward Neeve 's office . Neeve was deep in conversation with her assistant , that good-looking black gal . Denny did not give either of them time to dismiss him . He opened the bag , removed the sandwiches and said , " You gon na eat here ? " " Denny , you 're spoiling us . This is beginning to feel like room service , " Neeve told him . Denny froze , realizing his mistake . He . was getting too visible . But he wanted to hear any plans she might have . As though in answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll have to wait until late afternoon to go to Seventh Avenue on Monday . Mrs. Poth is coming in at one-thirty and wants me to help her select some gowns . " " That 'll pay the rent for the next three months , " Eugeniasaid briskly . Denny folded the napkins . Late afternoon on Monday . That was good to know . He glanced around the room . Small office . No window . Too bad . If there 'd been a window in the outside wall he 'd have a direct shot at her back . But Charley had told him it could n't look like a hit . His eyes swept over Neeve . Really good-looking . Really classy . With all the dogs out there , it was a real shame to have to waste this one . He muttered goodbye and departed , their thanks ringing in his ears . The receptionist paid him , adding the usual generous tip . But two bucks a delivery takes a long time before it adds up to twenty thousand , Denny thought as he opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was nibbling at the sandwich , Neeve dialed Toni Mendell at Contemporary Woman . When she heard Neeve 's request , Mendell exclaimed , " Ye gods , what is this all about ? Jack Campbell 's secretary phoned asking for the same thing . I told her I 'm worried about Ethel , too . I 'll be honest . I let Jack see a copy of Ethel 's notes because he 's her publisher . Those I ca n't give you , but you can have the article . " She cut through Neeve 's attempt to thank her . " But for Pete 's sake do n't show it around . There 'll be enough people in the rag game unhappyas it is when they see it . " Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One SleepsAn hour later , Neeve and Eugenia were poring over the copy of Ethel 's article . It was entitled " The Masters and the Masterful Phonies of Fashion , " and even for Ethel it was bitingly sarcastic . She began by naming the three most important fashions of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1947 , the Miniskirt by Mary Quant in the early sixties , and the Pacific Reef Look by Anthony della Salva in 1972 . About Dior , Ethel had written : In 1947 fashion was in the doldrums , still hung over with the military fashions of the war . Skimpy material ; boxy shoulders ; brass buttons . Dior , a shy young designer , said that we want to forget all about the war . He dismissed short skirts as a fashion of restriction . Showing what a real genius he was , he had the guts to tell a disbelieving world that the gown of the future for daytime wear would extend to twelve and a half inches from the ground . It was n't easy for him . A California klutz tripped over her long skirt getting off the bus and helped fan a national revolt against the New Look . But Dior stuck to his guns , or his scissors , and , season after season , introduced graceful , beautiful clothes  --  drapery below the ddcolletage , molded midriffs with unpressed pleats that merged onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest miniskirt disaster . Maybe someday all designers will learn that mystique is an important guideline to fashion . By the early sixties the times were changing . We ca n't blame it all on Vietnam or Vatican II , but the wave of change was in the air and an English designer , young and perky , swept onto the scene . She was Mary Quant , the little girl who did n't want to grow up and never , never wanted to wear grown-up clothes . Enter the Miniskirt , the shift , colored stockings , high boots . Enter the premise that the young must never on any accountlook old . When Mary Quant was asked to explain the point of fashion , where it was leading , she brightly answered , " Sex . " In 1972 it was all over for the Miniskirt . Women , tired of being confused by the hemline game , gave up the struggle and switched to menswear . Enter Anthony della Salva and the Pacific Reef Look . Della Salva began life not in a palace on one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you believe , but as Sal Esposito , in a farm on Williamsbridge Road in the Bronx . His sense of color may have been cultivated by helping his father arrange the fruits and vegetables on the truck from which they peddled their wares throughout the neighborhood . His mother , Angelina , not Countess Angelina , was famous for her cant-like greeting , " God bless yours momma . God bless yours papa . How about some nicea grapefruit ? " Sal was a mediocre student at Christopher Columbus High School ( that 's in the Bronx , not Italy ) , a very mildly talented student at F.I.T . Just one of the crowd , but as fate would have it , eventually one of the blessed . He came up with the collectionthat put him over the top : the Pacific Reef Look , his one and only original idea . But what an idea . Della Salva , in a single , magnificent stroke , put fashion back on the track . Anyone who attended that first fashion show in 1972 still remembers the impact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the tunic with the drifting shoulder panel , the wool afternoon dresses cut so that they draped and shaped the body , the use of pleated sleeves in tones that shimmered and changed with the light . And his colors . He took the colors of the tropical Pacific ocean life , the coral trees and plants and underwater creatures , and borrowed the patterns nature gave them to createhis own exotic designs , some brilliantly bold , some muted like the blues into silvers . The designer of the Pacific Reef Look deserves all the honors the fashion industry can bestow. 174Mary Higgins Clark y While My Pretty One SleepsAt that point , Neeve laughed reluctantly . " Sal will love what Ethel wrote about the Pacific Reef , " she said , " but I do n't know about the rest . He 's lied so much , he 's convincedhimself he was born in Rome and his mother was a papal countess . On the other hand , from what he said the other night , he 's expecting something like it . Everyone'shollering about how tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out what ship his folks were on when they sailed to Ellis Island and have a replicamade of it . " Having covered the giant fashion looks as she saw them , Ethel proceeded in the article to name the society designers who could n't tell " a button from a buttonhole " and hired talented young people to plan and execute their lines ; to expose the conspiracy among designers to take the easy way out and try to turn fashion upside down every few years , even when it meant dressing aging dowagerslike cancan girls ; to mock the cowlike followers who plunked down three or four thousand dollars for a suit with barely two yards of gabardine . Then Ethel turned her guns on Gordon Steuber : The Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire of 1911 alerted the publicto the horrendous working conditions of garment workers . Thanks to the International Ladies Garment Workers Union , the ILGWU , the fashion industry has become a field where talented people can make decent incomes . But some manufacturershave found a way to increase their profits at the expense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Long Island City . Illegal immigrants , many of them hardly more than children , work for pitiful wages because they do n't have green cards and are afraid to protest . The king of thesecheating manufacturers is Gordon Steuber . Much , much more about Steuber in a future article , but just remember , folks . Every time you put one of his suits on your back , give a thought to the kid who sewed it . She probably ca n't afford a decent meal . The article concluded with a paean of praise for Neeve Kearny of Neeve 's Place , who started the investigation of Gordon Steuber and who banned his clothes from her shop . Neeve skimmed the rest of the text about her , then put down the papers . " She 's drawn a bead on every major designer in the field ! Maybe she scared herself and decided to get away until the heat dies down . I 'm beginning to wonder . " " Ca n't Steuber sue her and the magazine ? " Eugenia asked . " Truth is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . What really kills me is that despite all this , Ethel bought one of his suits last time she was here  --  the one we slipped up on returning . " The phone rang . A moment later the receptionist buzzed on the intercom . " Mr. Campbell for you , Neeve . " Eugenia 's eyes raised . " You should see the look on your face . " She gathered the remains of the sandwiches with the paper wrappings and the coffee containers and swept them into the wastebasket . Neeve waited until the door closed before she picked up the phone . She tried to make her voice casual when she said , " Neeve Kearny . " Dismayed , she realized she sounded breathless. 1 176 177 ! Mary Higgins Clark Jack came right to the point . " Neeve , can you have dinner with me tonight ? " He did n't wait for her answer . " I was planning to tell you that I have some of Ethel Lambston 's notes and maybe we could go over them to- gether , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Neeve was embarrassed to realize how her heart was pounding . They agreed to meet at the Carlyle at seven o'clock . The rest of the afternoon became unexpectedly busy . At four , Neeve went out on the showroom floor and began to take customers . They were all new faces . One young girl who could n't have been more than nineteen bought a fourteen-hundred-dollar evening gown and a nine- hundred-dollar cocktail dress . She was very insistent that Neeve help her choose . " You know , " she confided , " one of my girlfriends works at Contemporary Woman and she saw an article that 's coming out next week . It says you have more fashion in your little finger than most of the designers on Seventh Avenue and that you never steer people wrong . When I told my mother she sent me over here . " Two other new customers had the same story . Some- one knew someone who had told them about the article . At six-thirty , Neeve gratefully put a " CLOSED " sign on the door . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor Ethel , " she said . " She 's probably hyped business more than if I 'd taken ads on every page of W. " After work Doug Brown stopped at the local superette on his way to Ethel 's apartment . It was six-thirty when , as he was turning the key in the lock , he heard the persistentringing of the phone . At first he decided to ignore it as he had done all week . But when it relentlessly continued to peal , he debated . It was one thing that Ethel did n't like anyone to answer her phone . But after a week , would n't it seem logical that she might be trying to reach him ? He placed the grocery bag in the kitchen . The harsh ringing continued . Finally he picked up the receiver . " Hello . " The voice at the other end was slurred and guttural . " I have to talk to Ethel Lambston . " " She is n't here . I 'm her nephew . Do you want to leave a message ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owes a lot of money to the wrong people and ca n't pay it while he 's paying her . If she do n't let Seamus off the hook , they 're going to teach her a lesson . Tell her she might have a hard time typing with broken fingers . " There was a click and the line went dead . Doug dropped the receiver onto the cradle and sank onto the couch . He could feel the perspiration on his forehead , in his armpits . He folded his hands to keep them from trembling . What should he do ? Was the call a real threat or a trick ? He could n't ignore it . He did n't want to call the police . They might start asking questions : Neeve Kearny . She was the one who was worried about Ethel . He 'd tell her about the call . He 'd be the scared , concerned relative asking for advice . That way , no matter whether it was a trick or for real , he 'd have covered himself. 178 179Mary Higgins Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fine costume jewelrywhen the phone rang in the shop . She picked up the receiver . " It 's for you , Neeve . Someone sounds terribly upset . " Myles ! Another heart attack ? Neeve rushed to the phone . " Yes . " But it was Douglas Brown , Ethel Lambston 's nephew . There was none of the usual sarcastic insolence in his voice . " Miss Kearny , have you any idea where I can try to reach my aunt ? I just got back to her place and the phone was ringing . Some guy told me to warn her that Seamus , that 's her ex-husband , owes a lot of money and ca n't pay it while he 's paying her . If she does n't let Seamus off the hook they 're going to teach her a lesson . She might have a hard time typing with broken fingers , the guy said . " Douglas Brown sounded almost tearful . " Miss Kearny , we have to warn Ethel . " When Doug hung up , he knew he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex  --  Police Commissioner 's daughter , he would now phone the police and report the threat . In the eyes of the cops , he 'd be viewed as a friend of the Kearny family . He was reaching for the phone when it rang again . This time he picked it up without hesitation . The police were calling him . Myles Kearny believed in getting out of the way on Friday whenever it was possible . Lupe , their longtime cleaning woman , was there all day , washing and polishing , vacuumingand scrubbing . When Lupe arrived , the morning mail in her hand , Myles retreated to the den . There was another letter from Washington , urging him to accept the post as head of the Drug Enforcement Agency . Myles felt the old adrenaline flowing through his veins . Sixty-eight . It was n't that old . And to get his teeth into a job that needed doing . Neeve . I fed her too much of love at first sight , he told himself . For most people it just does n't work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'll join the real world . He leaned back in the desk chair , the old , comfortable leather chair that had been in his office the sixteen years he 'd been Police Commissioner . It fits my butt , he thought . If I go to Washington , I 'll ship it down . In the foyer he could hear the sound of the vacuum . I do n't want to listen to that all day , he thought . On impulse he phoned his old number , the office of the Commissioner , identified himself to Herb Schwartz 's secretary , and a moment later was on the phone with Herb . " Myles , what are you up to ? " " My question first , " Myles responded . " How is Tony Vitale ? " He could envision Herb , small stature , small frame , wise and penetrating eyes , tremendous intellect , incredible ability to see the whole picture . And , best of all , true-blue friend . " We 're still not sure . They left him for dead and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they knew what they were doing . But the kid 's tremendous . Against all odds , the doctors think he 'll make it . I 'm going to see him later . Want to come ? " They agreed to meet for lunch . Over turkey sandwiches in a bar near St. Vincent 's Hospital , Herb briefed Myles on the upcoming Nicky Sepetti funeral . " We 've got it covered . The FBI has it covered . The U.S. Attorney 's office has it covered . But I do n't know , Myles . My guess is that with or without the celestial summons , Nicky was old news . Seventeen years is too long to be out of circulation . The whole world 's changed . In the old days the mob would n't have touched drugs . Now they 're swimming in them . Nicky 's world does n't exist anymore . If he 'd stayed , they 'd have had him hit . " After lunch they went to the ICU at St. Vincent 's . Undercoverdetective Anthony Vitale was swathed in bandages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood pressure , his heartbeats . His parents were in the waiting room . " They let us see him for a few minutes every hour , " his father said . " He 's going to make it . " There was quiet confidence in his voice . " You ca n't kill a tough cop , " Myles told him as he gripped his hand . Tony 's mother spoke up . " Commissioner . " She was speaking to Myles . He started to indicate Herb , but was stopped by the slight negative movement Herb made . " Commissioner , I think Tony is trying to tell us some-thing . " " He told us what we needed to hear . That Nicky Sepetti did n't put a contract out on my daughter . " Rosa Vitale shook her head . " Commissioner , I 've been with Tony every hour for the last two days . That 's not enough . There 's something else he wants us to know . " There was a round-the-clock guard on Tony . Herb Schwartz beckoned to the young detective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Listen , " he told him . Myles and Herb went down in the elevator together . " What do you think ? " Herb asked . Myles shrugged . " If there 's anything I 've learned to trust , it 's a mother 's instinct . " He thought of that longagoday when his mother had told him to look up the nice family who had sheltered him during the war . " There 's plenty Tony could have learned that night . They must have been going over everything to make Nicky feel up-to-date . " A thought struck him . " Oh , Herb , by the way , Neeve has been pestering me because some writer she knows has dropped out of sight . Tell the guys to keep an eye out for her , will you ? About sixty . Five five and a half or six . Dresses well . Dyed silver blonde . Weighs about one-thirty-five . Name is Ethel Lambston . She 's probably making someone 's life miserable interviewing them for her column , but ... " The elevator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled out a pad . " I 've met Lambston at Gracie Mansion . She 's been giving the Mayor a lot of plugs and he has her there all the time now . Something of an airhead , is n't she ? " " You 've got it . " They both laughed. 182 183Mary Higgins Clark 1 While My Pretty One Sleeps " Why is Neeve worried about her ? " " Because she swears Lambston left home last Thursdayor Friday without a winter coat . She buys all her clothes from Neeve . " " Maybe she was going to Florida or the Caribbean and did n't want to drag one along , " Herb suggested . " That was one of the many possibilities I pointed out to Neeve , but she claims all the clothes missing from Ethel 's closet are for winter wear , and Neeve would know . " Herb frowned . " Maybe Neeve is onto something . Go over the description again . " Myles went home to the peace and quiet of the shiningly clean apartment . Neeve 's phone call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going out to dinner . Good . I hope he 's interesting . " Then she told him about her call from Ethel 's nephew . " You told him to report the threat to the police . That was the right thing to do . Maybe she did get nervous and take off . I spoke to Herb about her today . I 'll let him know about this . " Myles settled for fruit and crackers and a glass of Perrierfor his own dinner . As he ate and tried to concentrate on Time magazine , he found himself increasingly concernedthat he had so casually brushed off Neeve 's instinctthat Ethel Lambston was in serious trouble . He poured a second Perrier and got to the center of his discomfort . The threatening phone call , as reported by the nephew , did not have the ring of truth. 184Neeve and Jack Campbell sat on a banquette in the diningroom of the Carlyle . On impulse , she had changed from the sweater dress she 'd worn to work to a soft multicoloredprint . Jack had ordered drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a glass of champagne for Neeve . " You remind me of the song ' A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody , ' " he said . " Or is it all right to call anyone a pretty girl these days ? Would you rather be a handsome person ? " " I 'll settle for the song . " " Is n't that one of the dresses the mannequins are wearing in your show windows ? " " You 're very observant . When did you see them ? " " Last night . And I did n't just happen by . I was overwhelminglycurious . " Jack Campbell did not seem uncomfortabledisclosing that fact . Neeve studied him . Tonight he was wearing a darkbluesuit with a faint chalk stripe . Unconsciously she nodded approval at the overall effect , the Hermes tie that exactly picked up the blue , the custom-made shirt , the plain gold cufflinks . " Will I pass ? " he asked . Neeve grinned . " Very few men manage to wear a tie that really goes with the suit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . " The waiter arrived with the drinks . Jack waited until he 'd left before he spoke . " I wish you 'd till me in a little . Starting with where did you get the name Neeve ? " " It 's Celtic . Actually it 's spelled N-I-A-M-H and pro-185Mary Higgins Clark while My Pretty One Sleepspounced ' Neeve . ' Long ago I gave up trying to explain it , so when I opened the shop I just used the phonetic spelling . You 'd be amazed at how much time I 've saved myse. to say nothing of the aggravation of being called Nim-ah . " And who was the original Neeve ? " " A goddess . Some say the exact translation is ' star of the morning . ' My favorite legend about her is that she swooped down to earth to pick up the fellow she wanted . They were happy for a long time , then he wanted to visit earth again . It was understood that if his feet touched the ground he would become his real age . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and poor Niamh left him a bag of bones and returned to the skies . " " Is that what you do to your admirers ? " They laughed together . It seemed to Neeve that it was by mutual consent they were putting off talking about Ethel . She had told Eugenia about the phone call , and , oddly , Eugenia found it reassuring . " If Ethel got a call like that , it says to me that she decided to take off until things cool down . You told her nephew to report it to the police . Your father 's on top of it . You ca n't do anything else . My bet is that good old Ethel is holed up in a spa . " Neeve wanted to believe it . She put Ethel out of here mind as she sipped the champagne and smiled across the table at Jack Campbell . Over celery remoulade , they talked about growing up . Jack 's father was a pediatrician . Jack had been raised in a suburb of Omaha . He had one older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tina has five kids . The nights get cold in Nebraska . " He had worked in a bookstore summersduring high school and become fascinated with , publishing . " So after Northwestern , I went to work inChicago selling college textbooks . That 's enough to prove your manliness . Part of the job is to see if any of the professors you 're peddling books to may be writing a book . One of them haunted me with her autobiography . Finally I said , Madam , let 's face it . You 've had a very boring life . ' She complained to my boss . " " Did you lose your job ? " Neeve asked . " No . They made me an editor . " Neeve glanced around the room . The soft elegance of the ambience ; the delicate china , handsome silver and fine damask tablecloths ; the flower arrangements ; the pleasant murmur of voices from other tables . She felt remarkably , absurdly happy . Over rack of lamb , she told Jack about herself . " My father fought tooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked being home . I went to Mount St. Vincent and spent one term in England at Oxford , then a year at the University of Perugia . Summersand after school I worked in dress shops . I always knew what I wanted to do . My idea of a good time was to go to a fashion show . Uncle Sal was great . From the time my mother died , he 'd send a car to take me when a collection was being unveiled . " " What do you do for fun ? " Jack asked . The question was too casual . Neeve smiled , knowing why he 'd asked it . " For four or five summers I had a share in a house in the Hamptons , " she told him . " That was great . I skipped last year because Myles was so sick . In the winter , I ski in Vail for at least a couple of weeks . I was there in February . " " Who do you go with ? " " Always my best friend , Julie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight out . " How about men ? " 186 187Mary Higgins Clark I While My Pretty One SleepsNeeve laughed . " You sound like Myles . I swear he wo n't be happy till he 's playing father of the bride . Sure I 've dated a lot . I went with the same guy practically throu college . " " What happened ? " " He went to Harvard for an MBA and I got involved with the dress shop . We just drifted into our own worlds . His name was Jeff . Then there was Richard . A really nice person . But he took a job in Wisconsin and I knew there was no way I could leave the Big Apple forever , so it could n't be true love . " She began to laugh . " The nearest I came to getting engaged was a couple of years ago . That was Gene . We broke up at a charity do on the Intrepid . " " The ship ? " " Uh-huh . It 's docked on the Hudson at West Fifty- sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend : black tie , tons of people . I swear I know ninety percent of the regulars at it . Gene and I got separated in the crowd . I did n't worry . I figured we 'd catch up eventually . But when we did , he was furious . Thought I should have tried harder to find him . I saw a side of him I knew I did n't want to live with . " Neeve shrugged . " The simple truth is I do n't think anyone has been right for me . " " So far , " Jack smiled . " I 'm beginning to think you are the legendary Neeve who leaves her admirers behind as she rides away . You have n't been exactly pounding me with questions about myself , but I 'll tell you anyhow . I 'm a good skier , too . I went to Arosa the past couple of Christ , - mas holidays . I 'm planning to look for a summer place where I can have a sailboat . Maybe you 'd better show me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settling 188 down a couple of times . In fact , I actually got engaged about four years ago . " " My turn to ask : What happened ? " Neeve said . Jack shrugged . " Once the diamond was on her finger , she became a very possessive young lady . I realized I 'd run out of breathing room pretty fast . I 'm a great believer in Kahlil Gibran 's advice on marriage . " " Something about the pillars of the temple stand apart ' ? " Neeve asked . She was rewarded by his expression of amused respect . " You 've got it . " They waited until they 'd finished their raspberries and were sipping espresso before they discussed Ethel . Neeve told Jack about the phone call from Ethel 's nephew and the possibility that Ethel was hiding out . " My father is in touch with his department . He 'll get them to run down who 's making the threats . And , frankly , I have to say I do think Ethel should let that poor guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him all these years . She needs that alimony like a hole in the head . " Jack pulled the folded copy of the article from his pocket . Neeve told him she 'd already seen it . " Would you call this scandalous ? " Jack asked her . " No . I 'd call it funny and bitchy and sarcastic and readable and potentially libelous . There is n't a thing in it that everyone in the business does n't know already . I 'm not sure how Uncle Sal will react , but knowing him I swear he 'll turn it into a virtue that his mother peddled fruit . Gordon Steuber I 'd worry about . I have a hunch he could be vicious . The other designers Ethel drew a bead on ? What can you say ? Everyone knowsthat except for one or two , the society designers ca n't draw straight . They just love the excitement of playir at working . " Jack nodded . " Next question . Do you think anything in this article would make an explosive book ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . " " I have a file of all the outtakes from the article . I have n't had a chance to study them yet . " Jack signaled for the check . Across the street from the Carlyle , Denny was waiting . It was a long shot . He knew that . He 'd followed Neeve when she walked along Madison Avenue to the hotel , but there 'd been absolutely no chance to get near her . Too many people . Big guys on their way home from work . Even if he 'd been able to waste her , the chances that someone would deck him were too strong . His only hope was that Neeve might come out alone , maybe walk to the crosstown bus , or even walk home . But when she came out , she was with some guy and they got into a cab together . A sense of frustration made Denny 's face turn ugly under the smears of dirt that made him blend in with the other winos in the area . If this weather kept up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work over the weekend . There was no way he was going to risk drawing attention to himself at the job . So that meant he could only hang around her apartment building early in the morning in case she went to the store or jogged , or after six o'clock . That left Monday . And the Garment District . SomehowDenny felt iri his bones that that was where he 'd end up . He slipped into a doorway , shrugged off the ragged overcoat , wiped his face and hands with a grimy towel , shoved coat and towel into a shopping bag and headed for a bar on Third Avenue . His gut was burning for a boilermaker . It was ten o'clock when the cab pulled up to Schwab House . " My father will be having a nightcap , " Neeve told Jack . " Are you interested ? " Ten minutes later they were in the study , sipping brandy . Neeve knew that something was wrong . There was a look of concern in Myles 's expression even while he chatted easily with Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not discuss now . Jack was telling Myles about meeting Neeve on the plane . " She ran so fast I could n't get her number . And she tells me she 'd missed her connection . " " I can vouch for that , " Myles said . " I waited for her at the airport for four hours . " " I must say I was delighted when she came up to me at the cocktail party the other day and asked about Ethel Lambston . I gather from what Neeve tells me Ethel is n't one of your favorite people , Mr. Kearny . " Neeve gasped at the change in Myles 's face . " Jack , " he said , " someday I 'll learn to listen to Neeve 's intuition . " He turned to Neeve . " Herb phoned a couple of hours ago . A body was found in Morrison State Park in Rockland County . It answered Ethel 's description . They brought Ethel 's nephew out and he identified her . " " What happened to her ? " Neeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Neeve closed her eyes . " I knew something was wrong . I knew it ! " " You were right . They already have a hot suspect , it seems . When the upstairs neighbor saw the squad car she came running down . Seems Ethel had a colossal fight with her ex-husband last Thursday afternoon . Apparentlyno one has seen her since then . On Friday she broke her appointments with you and with her nephew . " Myles swallowed the last of the brandy and got up to refill his glass . " I do n't usually have a second brandy , but tomorrow morning the homicide guys from the TwentiethPrecinct want to talk to you . And the DA 's office in Rockland County has asked if you 'd go out and look at the clothing Ethel was wearing . The point is they know the body was moved after death . I told Herb that you spotted the fact that none of her coats was missing and that she bought all her stuff from you . The labels were ripped out of the suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can identify it as one of yours . God damn it , Neeve , " Myles exclaimed . " I do n't like the idea of you being a witness in a murder case . " Jack Campbell reached out his glass for a refill . " Neitherdo I , " he said quietly . Sometime during the night the wind hadshifted , and the low-hanging clouds wereblown out over the Atlantic . Saturday dawnedwith a welcoming golden sun . But the air was still unseasonablycold , and the CBS weatherman warned that theclouds would be back and there might even be snow flur-192193Mary Higgins ClarkTies in the afternoon . Neeve bounded out of bed . She had a date to go jogging with Jack at seven-thirty . She pulled on a sweatsuit , her Reeboks , and tied her hair back into a ponytail . Myles was already in the kitchen . He frowned . " I just do n't like you jogging alone this early . " " Not alone . " Myles raised his eyes . " I see . Moving fast , are n't we ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now , do n't get your hopes up . You liked the stockbroker too . " " I did n't say I liked that one . I said he seemed respectable . There 's a difference . " Myles dropped the bantering . " Neeve , I 've been thinking . It makes more sense for you to go to Rockland County and talk to those detectives before you sit down with our guys . If you 're right , the clothes Ethel Lambston was wearing came from your shop . So that 's the first thing we establish . My guess is that after that you should go through her closet with a fine-tooth comb and see exactly what else is missing . We know homicide is going to zero in on the ex-husband , but you ca n't assume anything . " The intercom rang . Neeve picked up the receiver . It was Jack . " I 'll be right down , " she told him . " What time do you want to go to Rockland County ? " she asked Myles . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Midafternoon will be fine . " At her surprised expression , Myles added , " Channel Eleven is covering Nicky Sepetti'sfuneral live . I want a front-row seat . " While My Pretty One SleepsDenny had taken up his position at seven o'clock . At seven-twenty-nine he saw a tall guy in a running suit go into Schwab House . A few minutes later , Neeve Kearny emerged with him . They started jogging toward the park . Denny swore silently under his breath . If she 'd only been alone . He had cut through the park on the way over . It was almost deserted . He could have wasted her anywhere . He felt for the pistol in his pocket . Last night when he 'd gone back to his room Big Charley had been parked across the street waiting for him . Charley had rolled down the car window and handed out a brown paper bag . Denny had taken it , and his fingers had felt the outline of the gun . " Kearny is starting to cause real trouble , " Big Charley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it looks like an accident . Get her any way you can . " Now he was tempted to follow them into the park , to hit the two of them . But Big Charley might not like that . Denny began to walk in the opposite direction . Today he was wrapped in a bulky sweater that hung to his knees , torn chinos , leather sandals , a stocking cap that had once been bright yellow . Under it he was wearing a gray wig ; bits of greasy gray hair were plastered on his forehead . He looked like a mainliner with scrambled brains . In the other getup he looked like a wino . But this way no one would remember that any one guy had been hanging around Neeve Kearny 's building . As Denny put a token into the turnstile at the SeventysecondStreet subway , he thought , I oughtta charge Big Charley the money it cost me to change my clothes. 194 195Mary Higgins Clark While My Pretty One SleepsNeeve and Jack entered the park at Seventy-ninth Street and began jogging east , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neeve instinctively began to cut west again . She did not want to pass the place where her mother had died . But at Jack 's puzzled glance she said , " Sony , you lead . " She tried to keep her eyes resolutely forward but could not resist glancing at the area past the still bare trees . The clay Mother had n't arrived to pick her up at school . The principal , Sister Maria , had her wait in the office and suggested she begin her homework . It was nearly five o'clock before Myles came for her . By then she 'd been sure something was wrong . Mother was never late . The moment when she 'd looked up and seen Myles standing over her , his eyes red-rimmed , his expression a mixture of anguish and pity , she 'd known . She 'd reached up her arms to him . " Is my mother dead ? " " You poor little kid , " Myles had said as he picked her up and hugged her against him . " You poor little kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a burst of speed she ran past the quiet lane , past the extension of the Met that held the Egyptian collection . She was almost to the reservoir before she slowed down . Jack had kept pace with her . Now he took her arm . " Neeve . " It was a question . As they turned west and then south , now gradually reducing their pace to a fast walk , she told him about Renata . They left the park at Seventy-ninth Street . The last few blocks to Schwab House they walked side by side , their fingers linked . When she turned on the radio at seven o'clock on Saturdaymorning , Ruth heard the news of Ethel 's death . She had taken a sleeping pill at midnight and for the next hours slept a heavy , drugged sleep that was filled with vaguely remembered nightmares . Seamus was arrested . Seamus on trial . That she-devil , Ethel , testifying against him . Years ago Ruth had worked in a law office , and she had a fair knowledge of the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she listened to the newscast and lowered the teacup from her trembling fingers , she realized that she could add one more count : murder . She shoved her chair back from the table and ran into the bedroom . Seamus was just waking up . Shaking his head , he ran his hand over his face , a characteristic gesture that had always annoyed her . " You killed her ! " she screamed . " How can I help you if you wo n't tell me the truth ! " " What are you talking about ? " She snapped on the radio . The newscaster was describinghow and where Ethel had been found . " You took the girls picnicking to Morrison State Park for years , " she cried . " You know the place like the back of your hand . Now tell me the truth ! Did you stab her ? " An hour later , paralyzed with fright , Seamus made his way to the pub . Ethel 's body had been found . He knew the police would come for him . Yesterday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To show his displeasure , he 'd left the bar sticky and untidy . The Vietnamese kid who handled the196Mary Higgins Clarkkitchen was already there . At least he was a willing worker . " Are you sure you should have come in , Mr. Lambston ? " he asked . " You still look real sick . " Seamus tried to remember what Ruth had told him . " Say you have a touch of flu . You never miss work . They 've got to believe you were really sick yesterday , that you were sick last weekend . They 've got to believe you never left the apartment last weekend . Did you talk to anyone ? Did anyone see you ? That neighbor is bound to tell them you were there a couple of times last week . " " Darn bugs keep coming back on me , " he mumbled . " Yesterday was bad , but over the weekend I was sick . " Ruth phoned at ten o'clock . Childlike , he listened and repeated word for word what she told him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-timers who were still around started drifting in . " Seamus , " one of them boomed , his jovial race creased in smiles , " sad news about poor Ethel , but grand that you 're off the hook for the alimony . Drinks on the house ? " At two o'clock , shortly after the reasonably busy lunch service was winding down , two men entered the bar . One was in his early fifties , with a beefy build and ruddy complexion , a man who might as well have had a sign on him reading " cop . " His partner was a slim Hispanic , in his late twenties . They identified themselves as Detectives O'Brien and Gomez from the Twentieth Precinct . " Mr. Lambston , " O'Brien asked quietly . " Are you aware that your former wife , Ethel Lambston , has been found in Morrison State Park , that she has been the victim of a homicide ? " Seamus gripped the edge of the bar with knuckles that turned white . He nodded , unable to speak. 198While My Pretty One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " DetectiveO'Brien asked . He cleared his throat . " We 'd like to go over a few things with you . " After Seamus left for the pub , Ruth dialed Ethel Lambston'sapartment . The phone was picked up , but no one spoke . Finally she said , " I would like to speak with Ethel Lambston 's nephew , Douglas Brown . This is Ruth Lambston . " " What do you want ? " It was the nephew 's voice . Ruth recognized it . " I must see you . I 'll be right there . " Ten minutes later a cab was dropping her in front of Ethel 's apartment . As she stepped out and handed the fare to the driver , Ruth looked up . A curtain moved on the fourth floor . The upstairs neighbor who missed nothing . Douglas Brown had been watching for her . He opened the door and stepped back to allow her to come into the apartment . It was still inordinately tidy , although Ruth noticed a fine layer of dust on the table . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could even cross her mind at a time like this , she stood directly in front of Douglas , noticing the expensive bathrobe , the silk pajamasthat peered out from the hem of the robe . Douglas looked heavy-eyed , as though he 'd been drinking . His even features would have been handsome if they were strong . Instead they reminded Ruth of sculptures childrenmade in sand
