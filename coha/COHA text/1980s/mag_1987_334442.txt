Having sharpened his teeth on True Confessions and Dutch Shea , Jr. , John Gregory Dunne now takes the " big bite , " Mailerese for manly portions of theme and experience . The Red White and Blue even has some of the portentous overtones of Mailer 's An American Dream , and like the Champ , Dunne has an acute sense of evil and a highly developed sniffer for the hydrants of power . He is also wickedly funny , if your taste runs to hilarious funerals , jocular murder trials and droll executions : " The warden and I had the prime rib . Yorkshire pudding and strawberry shortcake . . . Last meals . It would make a hell of a cookbook . " <P> One of the author 's favorite words is " segue , " an old music term , now used freely in the movie business . It means to move smoothly and without hesitation from one element to another . The Red White and Blue , in fact , segues from the radical politics of the ' 60s to Viet Nam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture in which concepts of image and credibility have become acceptable alternatives for substance and truth . <P> Dunne 's is a cold , cruel and murderous world observed from an emotional distance . " I am by disposition one of life 's neutrals , a human Switzerland , " says Jack Broderick , the novel 's woeful narrator . He combines the characteristics of a disillusioned moralist with the casualness of an old- fashioned remittance man . A $10 million trust fund from his billionaire father allows him to play at making a living , if not a life . <P> Sometimes Broderick is a San Francisco newspaper columnist who roams the city looking for human-interest stories . His father , whose holdings include the paper , does not approve : " The butcher , the baker , the candlestick maker  --  you 're very tight with that whole bunch of deadbeats now , are n't you ? " Sometimes Jack is a Hollywood scriptwriter , and the bunch is livelier : Producer Marty Magnin , " reeking of Pinaud Lime Sec cologne . . . his shirt open four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugs of his hair transplant " ; Las Vegas Club Performer Buddy Seville , formerly Buddy Singapore and before that , Sandy Cairo ; a collection of film folk and pool lizards for whom sex is merely foreplay for gossip . <P> Broderick works best as a culture buzzard , circling scenes of death and derangement , identifying choice morsels by stripe and cry . His range includes a wide variety of wildlife : a condemned murderer named Germany Baker , a radical feminist with a wardrobe of obscene T shirts , an ambitious , self- absorbed television newswoman , black and Hispanic militants , limousine , liberals and Fritz Finn , President of the U.S. , who has had an affair with Broderick 's late sister . Jack 's brother Augustine , affectionately known throughout the world as Bro , is a Benedictine priest with 14 honorary degrees , a 43-line entry in Who 's Who and entree to Fidel and the Pope . One of Jack 's ex-wives , Leah Kaye , is a left-wing lawyer who defends brutish killers as victims of the pig establishment and has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Bed was where she held forth on genocide and Yanqui imperialism and racism and political prisoners and Amerika with a k , each topic an aphrodisiac in itself .
