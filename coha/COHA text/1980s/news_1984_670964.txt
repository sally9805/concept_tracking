The soy sauce " bioreactor " is one example of Japan ' s distinctive push into biotechnology . Indeed , one of Japan ' s major advantages in this emerging industry is what might be called the soy sauce factor. // Hundreds of years of making soy sauce , tofu , sake and other traditional food and drink , have given Japan great expertise in fermentation - the ability to change substances through the use of microorganisms . And fermentation is becoming a key technique in the biotechnology industry. // While small entrepreneurial companies have led the move into biotechnology in the United States and Europe , food and liquor companies are in the vanguard here. // The Office of Technology Assessment , a research branch of Congress , said in a report in January that Japan might be in a position to surpass the United States in the commercialization of biotechnology . " If we can combine the old technology with the new technology , we will have great power in this area , " said Akio Sato , an official at the Government-run Fermentation Research Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually brings to mind advanced techniques , such as genetic engineering . The best-known example involves recombinant DNA , in which a gene to produce , say insulin , is implanted into bacteria , which then start making insulin. // But that is only part of the story . Once a few bacteria are induced to make a substance , the bacteria must be grown and multiplied so that the substance can be mass-produced . It is in this mass-production stage that Japan ' s expertise could be of great advantage. // Still , many researchers here say that fermentation is not enough to put Japan in the forefront of biotechnology . They say that Japan must also catch up to the West in genetic research. // " The Office of Technology Assessment study very much overestimates the Japanese situation in biotechnology , " said Masami Tanaka , director of the bioindustry office at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. // Japan was a late starter in genetic engineering . Only after Western companies demonstrated the principles and potential of gene-splicing did industry and Government here take much interest. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than 150 companies have biotechnology projects . Several Government agencies have also started programs. // Corporate research and development spending on biotechnology totaled about $220 million in 1982 and has been growing at 20 percent a year . Government expenditures directly on biotechnology amounted to about one-fifth that level . In addition , the Government spends about $435 million a year on basic research in biology and medicine , according to Mr. Tanaka of the trade ministry. // One example of the Japanese approach is the Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Company , which specializes in fermentation . The company started by making alcohol for sake and shochu , two popular Japanese drinks . Then , in the 1950 ' s , it began applying its fermentation expertise to pharmaceutical products such as streptomycin. // In 1956 , Shukuo Kinoshita , now the company ' s chairman , discovered microorganisms that could be used to make L-Glutamic acid . That substance , in turn , is used to make monosodium glutamate - better-known as MSG , a flavor enhancer - as well as amino acids used in seasonings and intravenous fluids. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce interferon , a potential cancer-fighting substance , and other products of gene-splicing . Last September , it announced a process for mass-producing interferon. // To get started in genetic engineering , many Japanese companies initially teamed up with American or European concerns. // Shionogi &; Company , a pharmaceutical concern , recently completed clinical testing of human insulin produced through recombinant DNA techniques . The technology was licensed from Eli Lilly &; Company and Genentech Inc. , both United States concerns. // But Japanese companies and universities have recently begun producing original work and transferring technology abroad. // Suntory Ltd . , Japan ' s major liquor company , was the first concern to use a synthetic gene , rather than one isolated from a cell , to produce gamma- interferon , the type of interferon viewed as most promising as an anti- cancer agent. // In December , Suntory and the Schering-Plough Corporation , the United States pharmaceutical company , announced an agreement in which Schering-Plough would get access to Suntory ' s technology . In return , Suntory would get access to some of Schering-Plough ' s technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Japanese company has little experience. // " For the first time in Japan , we transferred our technology , " said Teruhisa Noguchi , head of biotechnology research for Suntory. // Last weekend it was announced that researchers at the Dai-Ichi Seiyaku Company , a pharmaceutical manufacturer , and Tottori University had produced interferon by genetically altering a virus that lives in silkworms . The researchers say the silkworms might be more efficient interferon producers than the bacteria usually used. // While pharmaceuticals have been the initial focus of biotechnology research , attention is shifting to agriculture and the chemical industry. // Kyowa Hakko used to make solvents using fermentation . But in 1961 , when oil prices were low , it decided to switch to petrochemical technology . Now , with oil prices higher and Japan worried about its dependence on foreign petroleum , some scientists hope production methods will change again. // Petrochemical plants operate at high temperatures and pressures , whereas biological factories would operate best at the low temperatures and pressures at which living things thrive . That could save huge amounts of energy. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biotechnology . A study by the international trade ministry found that , from 1973 through 1981 , foreigners acounted for 19 percent of all patent applications filed in Japan , but they filed 76 percent of the applications involving recombinant DNA . In the two years after that , however , foreigners accounted for only 55 percent of patent applications involving recombinant DNA. // However , few here think that Japan will catch up to the West in basic research. // One problem is a shortage of researchers trained in biotechnology . When Suntory decided to start a biotechnology program , it recruited about 20 Japanese researchers working abroad . It also now employs 40 women researchers , one-third of its total - an extraordinarily high proportion for Japan. //
