LOUIS L'AMOUR " It is a thought , Johannes , but I am afraid I am simply not the type . It is a bit tame for me , and will not accomplishwhat I wish . " " Mr. Fletcher says you have money . And you are looking for a Spanish don . " " He would think that . " She walked on a few steps . " What does your father say ? " " That you are a very bright young woman . " She smiled again . " I like that . Most men do not give a woman credit for intelligence . " And then she added , " And that may be an advantage . " We camped one night where there were many palm trees , and the following day we were among the Joshua trees again , those weird-looking trees with the twisted arms , although I did not think they looked much like trees . In the far distance there were mountains , and my fatherpointed to them . " That is where we will go , Hannes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean out there ? " " Beyond the mountains ? Yes , it is .

It was very dangerous , you know . There are outlaws , and also grizzly bears . " " In the town ? " " No , in the mountains a few miles from town . Sometimeswe rode there , several of us in a group , but your mother did not see the desert until we " eloped . But you are right . She came to love it . " " You ran away into the desert ?

I learned how to find water in the desert , and the plants that could be eaten and those that were poisonous . " Learn from the Indians , Hannes , but with them one must always be strong . They respect truth , and they respectstrength . " Yet always he watched the desert , and I saw him walk out to examine the trail , looking for tracks . Mr. Farley noticed it , too .

" That night when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coolness and stood there , feeling it all , loving the night and the stillness . Papa came out too , and stood beside me . " Papa ? Is someone coming ? " " I hope not , but this is Peg-Leg country . He 's a bad man , Hannes , and a very dangerous one . Twice I have seen the marks left by his wooden leg , and it is unlikely he would be afoot out here unless he was planning something . " " Would he rob us ? " " Of course . He would if he could , but he is cunning . He will not take a chance on getting killed . " We walked back to the others , and Papa said , " Stay away from the fire . " He advised Farley , " Let one man cook . The rest of you stay in the dark . Peg-Leg is out there , and he 's watching .

" It 's the Yuma trail . Agua Caliente is over yonder , at the foot of the mountains . " Later he said to me , " Sleep in the wagon tonight , with the women . If there 's any shooting , you 'll he safer . " 42 LOUIS L'AMOURI did not like that very much , but I knew better than to protest . My father was a kind man , but he did not like disobedience or argument . It was warmer in the wagon . Miss Nesselrode was surprised when I climbed in . " Your father is expecting trouble , " she said . " Peg-Leg Smith is here , " I told her . " My father has seen his tracks . He is a robber . " My father came to the back of the wagon . " Miss Nesselrode ? Have your weapons ready . This is more seriousthan the Indians . " " I have heard of him . There was some talk in Santa Fe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a very hard man . " " You know him ? " " Oh , yes . We traveled across the desert together once . Yes , I know him . He can be very affable , very pleasant . And he is not to be trusted for one minute . " The fire was down to coals before he came . We had the wagon at one side of a rough circle of rocks and ocotillo , a kind of sticklike cactus with very ugly thorns . He came riding up outside the circle and stopped in the glow of the fire . He was a big , burly man in a greasy homespun shirt , wearing a belt gun and carrying a rifle . He rode a meanlookingroan horse . " Hello , the camp ! All right if I come in ? " My father answered . " As long as you come alone , Peg . If even one other man raises a head , I 'll put a bullet into you . " " Verne ! By the Lord Harry , Zachary Verne ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I came back , Peg . My son 's with me . I 'm taking him home . " " Then you 're crazier than I thought . They 'll kill you , an ' him too . " " Peg , these people are my friends . We want no trouble , but we 're ready for it . " THE LONESOME GODS 43He stood in his stirrup . " All right ! " he bellowed over his shoulder . " Go have a drink ! All off for tonight ! " He swung down . " Hell , Verne , it would have to be you . I was fixin ' to kill the lot of you an ' steal your goods ! " He bellowed a laugh . " An ' maybe I 'll do it yet ! " 7His eyes twinkled , and he looked down at me . " I 'm just a-funnin ' , youngster . Why , old Peg-Leg would n't kill nobody , ' less he was a-shootin ' at me ! " Hey ? You 're a likely-lookin ' youngster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He looked at me again , then sat down by the fire , which was smoldering . He added a few sticks , then reached for the coffeepot . " Mind if I do ? " Taking a cup from the kitchen box , I handed it to him . " Thanks , boy . " He looked at me again , his hard blue eyes twinkling . " You scared of me , boy ? " " No , I am not . " He chuckled . " Do n't s'pose you are , boy , but some are , some are ! " " My father is n't . " He chuckled again . " No , I reckon he ai n't . Your papa shoots mighty good , boy . I 've seen it . And he takes no nonsense . Hell , if I 'd knowed he was along , I 'd never wasted time follerin ' you all . " Doug Farley came in from the dark , a shotgun in his hands . Coolly he poured a cup for himself . Peg-Leg looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool ! Do n't you go traipsin ' into Los Angeles ! They 'll kill you . I 'd back you against any three of them , but it wo n't be three , it 'll be six or eight . The old man wants you dead . " He held his cup in both hands , his wooden leg stretched out in front of him . Ile noticed me looking at it . " ThatTHE LONESOME GODS 45there 's the third one , boy . Whittled ' em out myself ! I busted the first one in some rocks , but the second ... " He looked up at my father . " Hell , Verne ! There was six or seven of them . They come at me in a cantina , aimin ' to stretch my hide . They had knives , and so did I , an old bowie , but when there 's that many .. . " Well , I fetched off my wooden leg an ' had at ' em ! I laid out four before they taken out . Like scared rabbits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two of ' em with busted skulls . " Trouble was , I busted my leg an ' had to limp out of there usin ' a chair . I done holed up in one of them canyonswhere there 's a trail from the San Fernando Valley down toward Rancho La Brea . I set up there until I whittled out a new leg . This'n 's better'n the other was . " " How 's the trail through Romero 's Pass ? " " Romero 's ? Oh , y'mean the one north of San Jacinto Mountain ? It ai n't bad . Sandy here an ' there , but you can go through , all right . " Romero ... I mind him . He was the Spanish captain who went through there first . I mean aside from Injuns . " He filled another cup . " Set down , Verne . I 'm peaceful , and them boys out there , they 'll be long gone back to camp . " He sipped his coffee , then glanced slyly at my father . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll hear it sooner or later . They be sayin ' that Tahquitz has come back . " My father did not immediately reply . He took his time filling his cup ; then he glanced over at me . " Tahquitz is supposed to be an evil spirit . Some say he 's a monster of some kind , even a dragon . Once in a while the mountains rumble and they say Tahquitz is trying to escape . " Long ago , so the story went , Tahquitz used to come down and steal maidens from the villages . They said he ate them . One day a brave young warrior tracked him into the mountains and found the cave where he lived , and walled it shut with Tahquitz inside . " My father looked across his cup at Smith . " What do you mean , ' come hack ' ? " 46 LOUIS L'AMOURPeg-Leg 's eyes twinkled slyly and he stole a look at my father . " They be sayin ' he 's out of his cave , an ' that he walks the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even down close to the hot springs . No Cahuilla will leave his lodge after dark . Not now . " " There are many such beliefs , " Papa said mildly . " This here 's more'n just a belief . Got so no Injun will even hunt in the piney woods . They stay down on the desert . They 're scared , Verne , real scared . I know Injuns , an ' no matter what folks say , they do n't scare easy . " There was a movement behind us , and looking around , I saw it was Miss Nesselrode . She had gotten out of the wagon and was coming up to the fire . Peg-Leg Smith saw her at the moment I did and scrambledup with surprising agility . He swept off his hat . " Ma'am ! I heard there was womenfolks along , but was n't expectin ' to have the pleasure . " " Please sit down , Mr. Smith . The coffee smelled so good I just had to have a cup . Besides , I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Smith looked pained . " Now , ma'am , that ai n't right . Ai n't right nor fair . If you was a man , I 'd shoot you for sayin ' that , but I ca n't shoot no woman . Especially no lady . It just ai n't fair , you takin ' advantage like that . Anyway , I never stole no horses of yours . " He looked at her suddenly . " I did n't , did I ? " " No , Mr. Smith , you have not . I hope you never will , Mr. Smith , because you have become something of a legend . I would not like to hang a legend . " " What ? " He was startled . " Yes , Mr. Smith . I may go into the horse business , and if ever I do , and if ever you steal any horses from me , I would follow you to wherever you went with however many men it took , and I would hang you , Mr. Smith . " " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't hang a poor one-legged man , would you ? After all , nobody'sever catched me with stole horses . It 's just one o ' them stories that gets around . " Anyway , that was all years ago . I 'm out here huntin ' aTHE LONESOME GODS 47gold mine I lost . " He looked at her , his eyes innocent . " You would n't want to invest in a gold mine , would you , ma'am ? " " No , Mr. Smith , I would not . " She held out a hand for his cup . " May I get you some more coffee , Mr. Smith ? " He watched her cross to the coffeepot and refill his cup . She returned it to him , smiling . " Tell us , Mr. Smith . How did you make three thousand horses disappear in the desert with men chasing you ? That should be a most interesting story . " " Now , now ! Ma'am , you should n't ought to believe such stories ! Them horses were stole by Injuns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Please , Mr. Smith ! Who led those Indians ? " Smith turned to look at Zachary Verne . " Zack ? How come you got this woman along ? Whose woman is she , anyway ? If she keeps talkin ' like this , she could get a body into trouble ! Why , I 'm an old man now , fixin ' to move up to Frisco an ' settle down . I ca n't have stories like that gettin ' around . Folks wo n't trust me ! " Smith was enjoying himself , and my father knew he was . " I d'clare , ma'am , if you was to want to go partners with me , I might just go back into business again ! " She smiled at him . " You 're a rascal , Mr. Smith , and a scoundrel , but I like you . You 're an interesting man . " She paused . " Tell me the truth , Mr. Smith . Did you really amputate your own leg ? " " Had to . Was n't nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did some cutting . Injun shot me in the leg , shattered the bone right below the knee . Was n't no doctor within a thousand miles , prob'ly . It was cut or die , and all the time , them Injuns was around . I 'd rather lose a piece of my leg than my hair . So I cut her off . " " You had no surgical training ? I 'm astonished . " " Ma'am ? What you all mean by surgical trainin ' ? Of course I had ! I 'd killed an ' skinned out maybe a hundred huffier , and as many deer , to say nothing of all the other game. 48 LOUIS L'AMOUR " Was n't one of us there had n't cut arrows out of people or cleaned up bad wounds one kind or another . I 'd done more cutting on animals and folks than nine out of ten surgeons . I 'd cut meat and I 'd cut bone maybe a times since I was a youngster . Cuttin ' on a man offers the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a world a whole lot different than ours ! Why , Ewing Young , him that was our leader a time or two , he was tellin ' us one time how a man named Harvey discovered the circulation of the blood . We thought that was almighty funny , amusin ' I mean , because every Injun on the Plains and in the woods knew all about it . Hunters for thousands of years understood , and those old priests who performed thousands of human sacrifices , do you think they did n't know ? This Harvey feller , he just wrote it up for folks to read . " I hear folks talkin ' about Lewis and Clark and all they discovered . ' Why , I talked with a Frenchman who was guide to David Thompson , the Hudson Bay man . That Frenchman had been all over that discovered ' country ten years efore ! " Mr. Smith , " Miss Nesselrode asked suddenly , " what is it like in California ? Over the mountains , I mean ? " He looked at her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is the best of lands , " he said quietly , " and will someday be among the greatest . Do n't go there unless you can grow . That 's the trouble with the Spanish folks , they 've lived too easy all these years , nobodyto fight , or reason to . Now some of them smart Yankees are there , things will be different . " Me , I 've been a mountain man and a trapper . Why do you think I left the East to trap for fur ? Because that was where the money was ! I could make more in a week , if I kept my hair , than I could make in a year back to home ! That 's why those other fellers come west , too . Now that folks want silk hats instead of beaver , those smart Yankeesare lookin ' about . They 've seen Los Angeles . " Now , you watch it change ! They wo n't be content to ride horseback or set in the sun ! Look at Wolfskill , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now he 's out there with grapes and oranges growin ' . You see , he 'll make him a fortune . Ben Wilson 's there , too , and Workman , Rowland , and others . " That country is goin ' to grow ! Folks who are smart are goin ' to get rich , and a lot of others are goin ' to set by and watch it happen . " Get hold of some land . It will last and be there when all the rest has changed . Everything else fades with time , but the land stays there . Sure , there 's floods , earthquakes , and storms , but by and large , the land stays . " Get land for the long pull , and look about to see what folks need most and get it for them and make them pay for it . " I 'm an old man now . Never was a hand to hold to money , anyway . I spent it all on drink and whatever , but you watch Ben Wilson , watch Wolfskill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowin ' men they be ! They will make Los Angeles into a city , and all you 've got to do is ride the river with them . You take it from me ! " " Thank you , Mr. Smith . " She held out her hand to him . I had never noticed how slim and beautiful her hands were . He took it in one of his , brown and hard and strong , and he looked at it , then at her . " It was a pleasure , ma'am . A pleasure . " Suddenly he got up , walked to his horse , and without touching a stirrup , swung himself into the saddle . Then he looked back at her . " I have a feelin ' about you , ma'am . I shall come to Los Angeles sometime , just to see if I 'm right . " And he rode away into the night . For a moment the firelight was on his broad back ; for a moment or two after that we heard the grate of his horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if he had never been , and we heard no other sound . Farley looked over at my father and shook his head in what must have been wonder , and Miss Nesselrode simplystood looking into the dying fire for a minute , then looked at Papa. 50 LOUIS L'AMOUR " He 's quite a wonderful man , is n't he ? " " He 's an old devil , " my father said , " but he is a wonderful man , too , and you , I think , have made a friend . " " I doubt I shall ever see him again . " " That may be , but he will not forget you . And do not underestimate the man . " My father coughed slightly ; then he said , " Some of the mountain men were finely educated , some were not , but all were extremely practicalmen whose minds were beautifully tuned . They could not be dull , for to let their wits dull was to invite death . " One does not need education to be intelligent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way of information , but their wits were sharp , their minds were alert , they were prepared to move , to change , to adapt at the slightest need . " All about them were conditions and circumstances to which they must adjust , attack by Indians or outlaw trappers was an ever-present danger , they lived on the very knife-edge of reality , and when this is so , the mind becomes a beautifully tuned instrument . " They did not fall into patterns or ruts . There were none . Each day was different , each brought new problems . No two traps could ever be set exactly the same . Whatever else you could say of these men , they were intelligent in the finest sense . Peg-Leg Smith is one of them . The men of whom he spoke were also mountain men , but of different character than Smith . When the money went out of the fur trade , they did not hesitate . They looked about for other opportunities , and in Los Angeles they found them . " Farley stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , " he said , " and tomorrow we go down into the real desert . " " Good night , gentlemen , " Miss Nesselrode said , and she went away to the wagon . When she was gone , Farley looked at my father . " Do you think he will come back ? " " No . " He paused . " Oddly enough , the man 's a gentleman , in his own way . If I were you , I 'd keep watch , butTHE LONESOME GODS 51I 'd bet every dollar I have that we will not see him again . My father turned away toward his blanket roll . " Hannes , I 'm tired . You 'll have to help me with my boots . " 8I n the night I was suddenly awakened  --  by what sound or sense , I do not know . Listening ... All was still . From under the wagon I could look out and see the morning star hanging in the sky like a light in a distant window . Then I thought of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whom I had never seen . Under the blankets I shrank , my stomach tied in a knot of fear . " I am Johannes Verne , " I whispered to myself . " I shall not be afraid . " Over and over I said it , and the words seemed to ease the tightness , and after a while I lay quiet , but wideawake . Carefully , not to disturb my father , who lay close by , I slid from under the blankets and went out to stand alone in the night . There was a step behind me , and turning , I saw Jacob Finney . " Ca n't sleep ? " Finney asked very softly . " I was awake . " Then I said , " I like it . The desert , I mean . I like the desert nights , and the stars . " " Yeah , me too . No matter how hot it is by day , the nights are cool . It 's a resting time . " " Sometimes I think there 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hear anything . " " I know . " Finney got out his pipe and began to stoke it . " Some folks ca n't abide the desert , but those who love it , like you an ' me , for them there 's no place like it . Kind of magic . " My mother loved the desert . " " Spanish girl , was n't she ? " 57THE LONESOME GODS 53 " Yes , sir . Her name was Consuelo . " " It has a lovely sound . " He lit his pipe . " Knowed a Spanish girl once , down Sonora way . I guess I was in love with her , but then there was trouble and I killed a man . Shot him . I had to leave . By now she 's married to somebody else an ' prob'ly never thinks of me . " He cleared his throat . " I think of her , though . I got something to remember , anyway . There was a fountain in the patio and we used to set there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we just set . Her mama was close by , but that made us no mind . We really did n't need to talk . " I heard about your pa an ' ma , an ' how they run off into the desert an ' were married there by a priest comin ' up from Mexico . " Ca n't figure why the old don hated him so . He was an Anglo , of course , and a Protestant . Maybe that 's enough for an old Spanish man who is proud of his name and family . An ' maybe it was because your pa was just a seaman . I do n't know , but it was too bad . But he 's become kind of a legend , y'know . " The way they chased him . Four or five bands of men huntin ' just her an ' your pa , an ' he slipped away from them , time an ' again . " The Injuns he'ped . They set store by your pa because during a starvation time for them he gave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped to make hisself wealthy so the old don might accept him . Well , when the Injuns was starving , he gave them beef , so when your grandpa was after him , the Injuns hid him , told him where to hide , like that . " Finney glanced at the stars . " Better roll your bed , youngster . We 're startin ' early because of the heat . " After Jacob Finney walked away , I turned back to the desert . For a long moment I stood perfectly still , listening . But was I listening ? What was I listening for ? I did not know . Behind me there was a stirring . Behind me there was movement , activity , but it seemed far away . I walked a few steps further and the sounds seemed to54 LOUIS L'AMOURrecede . I stopped again , and then I felt an odd coolness , a feeling of something strange , something different . I shook myself , but it was still there . I looked around and I could see people around the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was loading his rifle again , and my father was rolling his bed , yet it all seemed far away and in a world different from the one in which I stood . Yet I did not know why . I waited , expecting something , but I did not know what , and then I saw the shadow out there in the greasewood . A shadow where there was nothing that could offer a shadow . Yet something was there , something a little more tangible than a shadow , something that seemed to be appearing , something that seemed to be happening . Back at the fire , someone spoke , asking about me . I heard my father say , " He 's walked into the desert , but do not worry , he will be back . " Suddenly I was not at all sure if I could go back . That I even wanted to go back . I looked again for the shadow , and it was still there , standing as if waiting  --  waiting , perhaps , for me ? Turning sharply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , always with the feeling that I wanted to look back , even to go back  --  perhaps to join that shadow ? No . . . not that . Not that exactly . My father walked out to meet me . " Hannes ? Are you all right ? " " Yes , I am . " He stood beside me for a moment and said , " Your mother and I used to walk into the desert at night . We loved it , and loved our time together . " Long ago , before the Indians who live here now , there were other people . Perhaps they went away , or maybe they died or were driven out by these Indians ' ancestors , but they are gone . Yet sometimes I am not sure they are gone . I think sometimes their spirits are still around , in the land they loved . " Each people has its gods , or the spirits in which they believe . It may be their god is the same as ours , only clothed in different stories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be strong , Hannes , if he is worshiped , and the gods of those ancient people are lonesome gods now . " They are out there in the desert and mountains , and perhaps their strength has waned because nobody lights fires on their altars anymore . But they are there , Hannes , and sometimes I think they know me and remember me . " It is a foolish little idea of my own , but in my own way I pay them respect . " Sometimes , when crossing a pass in the mountains , one will see a pile of loose stones , even several piles . Foolish people have dug into them , thinking treasure is buried there . It is a stupid idea , to think a treasure would be marked so obviously . " It is an old custom of these people to pick up a stone and toss it on the pile . Perhaps it is a symbolical lighteningof the load they carry , perhaps a small offering to the gods of the trails . I never fail to toss a stone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a small offering to those lonesome gods . " A man once told me they do the same thing in Tibet , and some of our ancient people may have come from there , or near there . Regardless of that , I like to think those ancient gods are out there waiting , and that they are , because of my offerings , a little less lonely . " When I climbed into the wagon , Miss Nesselrode was sitting up , and Mrs. Weber was also . Fraser was lying half on his side , still trying to sleep . Fletcher seemed not to have moved from where he sat . He stared at me , then looked away irritably . He did not like me , but then , he did not seem to like anybody . My father got into the wagon at the last and sat near the back . Nobody talked . Some of us dozed . We were descending slowly , and we had been told it would be hot . The sun came up and the coolness disappeared . Fraser hesitated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a bit , Fletcher did likewise , and unbuttoned his vest . " It 's below sea level down there , " Fraser said suddenly . " One of the hottest , driest places in North America . " Nobody answered him . He mopped his face , and then56 LOUIS L'AMOURhe said , " It used to be an old sea bottom , or maybe the bottom of a lake . " My father looked around at him . " When we get down a little further , " he said , " you can see the old beach line along the edge of the mountains . There are seashells there , some of them thin as paper , and they almost crumblein your hands . " " But surely , " Miss Nesselrode said , " that was a very long time ago ? " " A very long time , " my father said , " yet the Indians have memories of it . They say the basin has filled up five times within their memory .

Of course , according to the story , it was loaded with treasure . " " Nobody found it ? " Fletcher asked . " Not yet . At least there 's been no report of it being found . " " There might be something to it , " Miss Nesselrode suggested . " Did not the Spanish believe California was an island ? The crew evidently hoped to sail around the other end .

" " Betcha some of them Injuns know where it is , " Fletcher commented . He turned his eyes on my father . " They tell me you know them Injuns . They might tell you where it is . " They might , " my father said . " Indians have their own ways of thinking , and many of the things important to us are not at all important to them . Also , they might not think it safe to tell another white man where Indians had killed white men .

" It 's mighty hot , " Farley told my father , " but I want to get to the mountains . Once we get to Agua Caliente , we can hole up . Stay a couple of days , if need be . " He paused . " Do you know the place ? " " I do . It is likely you 'll find some Cahuillas camped there . " " I never knew them to be trouble . " " They are not , if you respect them and their ways . " " They the ones who helped you ? " " One of the tribes . The Luisenos and Chemehuevis did also . " There was no more talk . It was very hot , and I tried to sleep .

We 'll have no water until we cross the desert . " Fletcher sat up , grumbling , but Farley paid no attention . Fraser pulled his skinny knees closer and tried to write . Mrs. Weber dabbed at her nose with a flimsy handkerchief , and Miss Nesselrode simply leaned her head back and closed her eyes. 58 LOUIS L'AMOURNobody talked , nobody wanted to talk ; they just sat . " Oven ! " Fletcher said suddenly . " It 's like an oven ! " Mrs. Weber fanned herself with her hat . She had removedit at last , and her hair was drawn tight to her skull except for buns over each ear . Her hair was parted in the middle , and she looked more than ever like a tired bulldog . Miss Nesselrode opened her eyes to look toward Farley , who sat on the driver 's seat . I had not noticed before how large her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a perfectly straight face , she winked . I jumped . It was so unexpected , and I had never seen a lady wink before , although Papa sometimes did . But her wink from such a straight face was so droll that I had to smile , then I grinned , and she smiled back , then closed her eyes . I decided I really liked Miss Nesselrode . It was almost dark inside the wagon when my father sat up . I had been asleep , and so had most of the others . Jacob Finney was driving the team , and Farley was sitting in the very front of the wagon behind him , his eyes closed . " We 're comin ' up to Indian Wells , " Jacob said over his shoulder . " Hear the place started as a spring , but the water level kept falling . Now they have to go down steps to get to it . " It was cool now . It was as if the heat had never been . Mrs. Weber put her hat on , and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I saw that Mr. Fletcher carried a small derringer in his vest pocket . Later , when we had stopped and were alone , I told my father . " Good ! " He squeezed my arm . " You are observant . I like that , and it is important . " " It is on the left side , " I said , " and the butt is turned toward the left . " " Oh ? " He paused a moment . " Now , that is interesting . The butt toward the left ? That I had not noticed . " 9t was after midnight when we stopped at Indian Wells . My father climbed from the back of the stage , staggeringa little . " Mister ? " It was Kelso . " You all right ? " " Yes , yes , thank you . A little unsteady , is all . Will we be here long ? " " We 're changin ' horses here . Our stock 's about played out , an ' Farley had planned to get a fresh team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed off into the darkness . " There 's the Indian well that gives the place a name , but maybe you know all that . " You have to go down steps to get to the water , but it 's good water . Cold . " " I could use a drink . So could my son . " There was a pause while Kelso removed his hat and wiped the sweatband . " Lunger ? " he asked gently . " I 'm afraid so . I 've been coughing less since I reached the desert , though . " " Why n't you stay over at Agua Caliente for a few days ? Folks say that hot , dry air is good for lungers . " " I have n't much time , Kelso . I am taking my son to his grandparents in Los Angeles . " Mr. Kelso walked away in the night and my father put his hand on my shoulder . " Hannes ? See that big old palm tree over there ? The Indians say one of their wise men , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he could continue to serve his people . " " How could he do that ? " " He willed it . He stood very straight and very still and5960 LOUIS L'AMOURwilled himself to become a tree , and slowly he began to change until he became that tree . " " Do you believe it , Papa ? " " I have never seen such a thing happen , Hannes . My reason tells me it could not happen , but my reason can only judge by what I know , and I do not know everything . " Indians are different from us . They have other beliefs , and other reasons for believing . It is best not to dispute what the Indians say , but to listen and learn , making your judgments later . " He glanced toward the small building where the light shone from a window and an open door . " Stay by the stage , son . I shall be back in a minute . " No one else had left the stage . All were asleep or trying to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold water , and I was thirsty . The men who had taken the horses away had not returned with the fresh team . Edging closer to the rift in the earth where the well was , I peered down . Far below I could see the gleam of water . Carefully I tried the first step , then another . One by one I descended . When I stood on the square of earth near the water 's edge , I looked up . All I could see was a rectangle of sky and two stars . When I looked around , straining to see in the darkness , I saw a huge olla or jar , and hanging beside it , a gourd dipper . Dipping it into the cold water , I drank and drank . Nothing had ever tasted so good . I filled the dipper again , and then realized somebody was watching me . It was an Indian , a very , very old Indian wearing a loose cotton shirt . His hair was thin and gray , bound with a band around his head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck was a triangleof blue stone with markings on it . " Oh ? I am sorry , sir . I did not see you at first . " I dipped the gourd into the water and held it out to the Indian , who merely looked at me . Then my father called , and I put the gourd dipper down and hurried up the steps . " I am sorry , sir . Please forgive me , " I said over my shoulder . My father was beside the wagon and he turned at theTHE LONESOME GODS 61footsteps . " You had me worried . I was afraid you 'd wanderedoff . " " I was getting a drink . " When the wagon was moving again , I said to my father , " I saw an Indian . " Fletcher was sitting up . " Ai n't likely . They tell me Injuns do n't come to the well no more . Not at night , anyway . " " He was very old , " I said , " and he had a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Fletcher said . " They set store by it . More than gold . " He glanced at me . " Turquoise is a kind of rock , " he said . The new team moved off at a good gait , Finney driving . Farley had crawled back into the wagon and found a place where he could recline on the blanket rolls . " Next stop is Agua Caliente . You 've been there before , Verne ? " " Yes , several times . It 's right at the door of the San Jacintos . Some of the Anglos are beginning to call it Palm Springs . There 's nobody there except three or four white men and some Cahuilla Indians . " He paused . " I am expecting some mail there . " He leaned back against the baggage , and after a while I did also . I was tired , tired for want of sleep and tired of the wagon . I just wanted to be someplace and not to have to go on , day after day . Lying awake in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped in an inland sea from which it could not escape , sailing around and around forever until someday it ran aground and could sail no more . I dreamed of finding that ship and going aboard and finding chests of gold and chests of pearls . Or chests of turquoise like the old Indian wore . The horses were trotting now , hurrying . We would soon be in Agua Caliente , and then on to Los Angeles . How many more stops ? Five , six , a dozen ? I did not know . The wagon rumbled along in the night and my father sat up , bringing his holster around to a better position . He took his rifle and placed it beside him also . Was there to be trouble , then ? A long time later , when I had slept , awakened , and62 LOUIS L'AMOURslept again , the wagon rumbled to a stop . Peering out past Mr. Finney 's head , I could see a lighted window and a door opening to let light stream out . A man came from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the back of the stage and slid to the ground . He had straightened up when the man came around the wagon . " Verne ? Are you there ? Is it you ? " " How are you , Peter ? It 's been a long time . " " Let 's go inside and have some coffee . " The man was as tall as my father and had a handlebar mustache of golden brown , and a goatee . He glanced at me . " This is your son ? " " Johannes ? This is Peter Burkin . He 's an old friend . " " We 've got to talk , Zack . Serious talk . Let 's all go inside . " " We 've only a minute . We 're just changing teams again . Farley 's in a hurry to get in . " " That 's just it , Verne . You must n't go any further . If you go into Los Angeles , you will be killed . You and the boy as well . " " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10They went inside , and I followed . It was a small store with a bar along one side and three tables . Behind the bar were a few bottles ; behind the counter on the other side , were some packages , cans , and boxes of groceriesor supplies . My father dropped into a chair . His face was gray and his eyes hollow . He looked worse than I had ever seen him . " Peter , I 've got to see them ! I have to convince them ! My son will need a home and he has no other kin . " I 'm not worried about dying . I 've accepted that and I expect I 'm as ready as a man ever gets . If they kill me , it will only lessen the suffering , but it is Johannes who matters . " " You do n't understand , Zack . The way they see it , you disgraced the family by marrying their daughter , and your son is living evidence of their shame . They want him dead , Zack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cups and the coffeepot , filling both cups . I sat on a bench against the wall and almost behind my father , although I could see the side of his face . His appearance frightened me . He looked so haggard , so exhausted , so drawn . When he glanced around , his eyes unseeing , I was shocked by the desperation in his eyes . " My God , Peter , what will I do ? I 've no home for the lad ! I 've come all this way , hoping desperately they'd64 LOUIS L'AMOURtake him in . The Californios I 've known were kind to their children , and I hoped .. . " Peter , we 've no place to go ! No place at all ! The last time I saw a doctor , he gave me four or five months , and that 's been over three months ago ! " " Zack ? Let me get your gear off that wagon . They know you 're coming , and they 're waiting . There will be four or five of them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon yard . They 've men posted on the trails into town . " You were always handy with a gun , but in your best days you could n't handle that many at close range . Nobodycould . " Peter Burkin got up . " Sit right here , Zack . I 'll get your gear . " He leaned his big hands on the table . " Look , Zack , I 've found a place here . The air is good for lungers , so take a few days , anyway . Get rested , think about it , and we can talk it over . Maybe there 's an answer . You wo n't help the boy by getting yourself killed . " He paused at the door . " You loved the desert , Zack . Give it a chance . " Peter Burkin went outside and my father stared into his coffee , then tasted it . After a moment he drank more . He seemed to have forgotten that I was there . Behind me the window was open and I could hear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his duffle off . Yeah , they 're waitin ' for him . You 'll see when you pull up at the Bella Union . Do him a favor and tell them nothing . " Farley said something I did not hear and then Peter replied , " How was he on the trip west ? " " Bad , real bad . He did his share and more , he 's that sort of man , but he was coughin ' the whole way . Got so 's we got used to it an ' scarcely noticed . I will say he 's coughed a mite less since we crossed the Colorado . I think all that desert before helped him some . " " I 'll get his gear . " " Burkin ? What 's behind it ? I know all about Spanish pride and I know Verne was n't a Catholic and was a common seaman  --  THE LONESOME GODS 65 " An uncommon seaman , if you ask me . " " What 's behind it ? " " Search me . I 've no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so 's the other one , the man she was supposed to marry . Seems he 'd had trouble with Verne before , and when Consuelo ran off with Verne , he was fit to be tied . " Burkin was removing gear from the wagon , and then he said , " Say nothing about it , will you ? " " I ca n't vouch for the others . There 's bound to be talk . " My father finished his coffee and walked outside , and I followed . Peter Burkin waited on the stoop . " I 've a place for you , Zack . It 's an old adobe somebody fixed up , and if you can set a horse , you can be there in just a few minutes . " When we mounted , he led us toward the looming mountain , all black and mysterious . Peter saw me looking at it . " That 's where Tahquitz lives , boy . Or so the Injuns say . " He stole Injun girls an ' et ' em . Chewed ' em right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste of girls , so they taken after him , found the cave where he slept , bones all around it . They say a young Injun walled him in . Your pa knows that story . " " He told me . Do you believe it ? " " You get up in those mountains alone , boy , or you get out in some desert canyon , an ' you begin to believe most everything . " There 's medicine men who can raise storms , they say , and they can make the dead walk , and some as say they can see the future or what takes place far away . Your pa knows more about such things than me , but I 've heard talk around the campfires , spooky talk of ghouls an ' ghosts , an ' like the Scotch say , ' of things that go bump in the night . ' " The mountain loomed black against the night , with the stars hanging above , and I thought of Tahquitz and shivered . Was he up there now ? Prowling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavern , struggling to escape ? 11Peter Burkin led the way through low sandhills to a small adobe surrounded by a living barricade of what seemed to be tall spines of cactus . " Ocotillo , " he explained , " makes the best fence ever . " He spoke over his shoulder , as I was close upon him , and my father trailing some distance behind . " Boy ? You an ' me , we got to keep your pa here . He 's a mighty sick man , but if anything can help him , this climate will . " You tell him you like it here . Get him to stay on . You talk to him , boy . " He pulled up in the yard and stepped down , then lifted me from the saddle , although I could slide down and did not want to be picked up like a baby . " Do you know anyone who knows the stories about Tahquitz to be true ? " I asked . He brushed his mustache with his fingers . " Well , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Injuns been here longer than us and they may know a lot we 'll never learn . Knowledgeis n't a lasting thing . Not unless it 's writ down in a good many places . People die , and what they learned often dies with them . Whole races of folks that once lived are now gone , and what they knew we 'll not be able to guess at . " I 'm not a book-read man , boy . I never had no proper eddication , but I 've listened to those who have had and to those who 've traveled . " Take your pa , now . He 's a widely read man . He was a sailor onetime . You know that . He was a sailor on his THE LONESOME GODS 67papa 's ship , so he had access to his papa 's books , and there were times at sea when he could read . " He first went to sea when he was twelve , as cabin boy with his pa . He went to a lot of places with fancy names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r'ar up an ' go . Places like Shanghai , Rangoon , Gorontalo , Capetown , and the like . Your pa had seven years at sea , mostly in foreign parts . " You 've heard him talk . He 's got a way about him , a way with words . He can make the temple bells tinkle for you , and you can just hear them big old elephants shuffshufflingalong , the priests callin ' folks to prayer and the like . " Your pa learned a sight of things most folks never even hear of . I 've seen scholars back off an ' look at your pa , amazed . " You take these Injuns , now . You look at the way they live and you 'll say they do n't amount to much , but what are they thinkin ' ? What do they know ? What memories do they have ? They want different things , boy , and they consider different things important . Many a thing we 'd give anything to know , they just take for granted . " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in tune with something . I do n't know what . But some of them have lost touch with it , and others are losin ' touch . Goin ' the white folks ' way might seem the likely thing to do , but maybe they lose as much as they gain . " Papa rode into the yard , sat his horse for a moment as if he was gathering strength , and then he dismounted , stepping down very carefully . " I 'll put up the horses , Zack . You 'll find a candle on the table just inside the door . To the right of the door . " There were three rooms , two very small bedrooms and a large , square living room and kitchen combined . There was a very large fireplace , a table , benches on each side of it , and two chairs . One of the chairs was very large , almost twice the size of any I had seen . My father stopped , lighted candle in hand , and stared at that chair. 68 LOUIS L'AMOURThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . No mortar had been used , but the stones were fitted with knifelike precision . " There 's nothing much here at Agua Caliente , " Peter Burkin explained when he came in . " There 's the hot springs to which the Injuns been comin ' for a couple of thousand years , I reckon . There 's a stage station , but no stages yet , and it 's a kind of two-bit store an ' post office . Mail comes in ever ' once in a while , sometimes as often as ever ' two months . " There 's two or three white men in camp , an ' there 's the Injuns , mostly Cahuillas . " He looked at me . " That 's the way they say it , Ka-wee-ya . Some folks call them Agua Calientes , from the name of the village . " There 's more of them back in the mountains . In the Santa Rosas . " They know you , Zack , so they 'll be friendly , which means you wo n't see much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . As long as you live in this house , none of them are likely to come around . " " What 's wrong with the house ? It seems uncommonly well-made . " " You wo n't find a better anywhere about . Not even in Los Angeles . The stable out back is built just as well . There 's a spring , cold water , that 's runnin ' into a fine stone basin , made by the same hands . " Nobody 's lived here for years , though . The house is considered bad medicine . They 'll think you a strong man for even livin ' here . " Burkin went back outside and brought their blanket rolls into the house . " Peter ? I ca n't thank you enough . " " Thank me ? You done that years ago when you pulled me from under that grizzly . " He turned to me . " I was gettin ' chawed an ' clawed somethin ' fierce when your papa came along . He kilt that b'ar an ' then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there until I was able to get around . I was laid up for more than a month , an ' your papa put off what he was loin ' an ' cared for me . THE LONESOME GODS 69Peter Burkin rode away and I watched him go . Already the sky was faintly gray , and I could see the stark black outline of his figure against the white of the sand dunes . My father was lying down , and from his breathing , was asleep . Although I had been awake most of the night , I was not tired . What was it about this house ? Why did no one want to live here ? Again I looked at that huge chair . Was it that ? Did the sight of that chair frighten people away ? Everything about the house was cunningly made . The closets and shelves were cut and fitted with the same precision as the tiles in the flagstone floor . Part of the house was very old . I could see where someone had begun rebuilding it , building up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin had been taken and added to , walls rebuilt , a roof put on , floor added . . . or part of a floor . Out back there was not only a stable but a corral . There were two horses there , left for our use . My father had taken off his gun belt and hung it over a chair back close to his hand . His rifle and his shotgun were there , too . There was a blanket hung in the doorway , and I tiptoed back and let the blanket down to cover the door . This was my home now . For how long , I did not know , for it seemed that now I was not to go to that fierce old man of whom I was so much afraid . On the table there was a loaf of bread , and beside it a knife . I went to it and cut off a thick slice . With the bread in my hand I went back to the outer door again and looked out upon the yard . All around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorns . There had been rain , so now there was a mist of green leaves along each cane , and a few bright crimson flowers . I stood there , taking bites of the bread and looking out at the yard of white sand . Where the opening in the ocotillo fence was stood a thick clump of greasewood . I glanced at it , started to look away , then looked quickly hack. 70 LOUIS L'AMOURSomething was there ! From behind the bush I could see a bare foot , a foot almost the color of the sand , and the bottom of a pants leg of white . Lifting my eyes , I found myself staring into other eyes , very black eyes . It was a boy , no older than myself. 12Torn between fear and curiosity , I waited , my heart pounding . The strange boy crouched , peering through the leaves at me . I was afraid . No ! I was not afraid ! " I am Johannes Verne , " I told myself , " and I am not afraid . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no larger . I knew I could lick him . Then I looked again as the boy slowly emerged from behind the bush . The boy looked brown and . strong . He looked like a very rough boy . Maybe I could not lick him . He wore a wide hat of straw , somewhat torn , and a faded blue shirt that hung outside his pants , which were of white cotton . The boy was barefoot . " Hello , " I said . " Buenos dias . " He came a step nearer . I did not know what to do . Trying to appear indifferent , I squatted and took up a twig . With the twig I drew a round head with long hair hanging down . Then I drew a hat on the head . I did not know what to say or do . I had known few children of my own age and did not know what they did . I added eyes and eyebrows , then ears to the picture . " What do you do ? " The boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " It is a picture . " He leaned over , studying it . " Is it me ? " " It is . " " The mouth ? It has no mouth . I have a mouth . " I extended the twig . " Here . You draw . " 72 LOUIS L'AMOURHe took the twig and drew a mouth like a new moon with the ends turned up . It was a smiling mouth . " Good ! It is finished , " I said . We squatted side by side , looking at our drawing with some satisfaction . " You live close by ? " " I live where I am . " " You have a house ? " The boy gestured vaguely . " Over there . " Then , proudly : " I am Francisco . " " I am Johannes . I am usually called Hann-ess . " The boy shrugged . " What else ? " He was a strange boy . I did not know what to think of him . I asked , " Where do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " The boy paused . " And you ? You will live here ? " " I do not know . We were to go to Los Angeles , but there is trouble for us there . " " Stay here , if you are not afraid . " " I am not afraid . I am Johannes . " Then , after a minute : " Afraid of what ? " " The house . Nobody stays in that house . It is the house of Tahquitz . " " What ? " I was astonished . I pointed to the mountains . " There is the house of Tahquitz . " Changing the subject , I asked , " Your home is here ? " Francisco shrugged . " My home is where I am . Sometimesit is in the mountains . Often it is the desert . " " You are not afraid of Indians ? " He stared at me . " I am Indian . I am Cahuilla . " I was astonished . " You ? An Indian ? " " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house of Tahquitz ? " " Much time ago my people went away into the desert to live . There had been rains and it was good there , but when they returned , this house was here , and it was lived in " Nobody saw he who lived here . Only ... sometimes at night they saw something ... somebody . Then it wentTHE LONESOME GODS 73away and came no more . It was whispered that Tahquitz had come to this house . That he built it with his hands . " " It is a good house . " " What will you do if he comes back ? " " He will come back ? " Francisco shrugged . " Who knows ? It has been long . " " There was a house before , " I suggested . " Part of this house was an older house . " " Who knows ? Perhaps . " Francisco squatted by the step . I sat on the step . " I have a horse , " I said proudly . " Of course . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Francisco took a stick and poked at the ground . From time to time he looked uneasily at the half-open door . " The mountain is large , " I said . " Is it far to the other side ? " " It is far . Two times I have gone with my papa . We go for the chia that grows in a valley there . It grows many places , but not so much as in the valley . Once , the first time , there was fighting . There were others who wished all the chia for themselves . We gathered chia . Some chia . " " Is this your land ? " Francisco shrugged . " It is land . We come here . Sometimeswe do not come for a long time . When it is hot , we stay in the mountains , where there is coolness . " " You speak well . " " It is nothing . In the store it is only your talk . My papa speaks much with people . He teaches me to speak . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very dark , I went down to drink . There was an Indian there . He did not speak . " Francisco stood up . " I go now . " " You will come back ? " " I go " He walked away , slowly at first , then faster . He did not look back . When I went back inside , the room was light , and for the first time I could really see the floor . It was astonishing in its simple beauty . Around the outer edge was an intri-74 LOUIS L'AMOURcate design and in the middle a black bird with its wings stretched , a bird like a crow . Sitting down on the bench , I looked at the design . The details of the feathers in the wings was amazing , and the bird had small red stones for eyes . My father spoke from his bedroom . " Is it you , Hannes ? Are you all right ? " " I am looking at the bird . " " I heard you talking , I think . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my friend .. . I think . " He came from the bedroom and closed the outer door . " After the sun is up , it is better to keep the door closed so it will be cool inside . " He put his hand on my shoulder as he so often did . " It is good to have a friend . " He glanced down at the floor for the first time . " Well , I 'll be damned , " he said . Squatting on his heels , he studied the floor . He ran his fingertips over the floor . " Beautiful ! " he said . " Simply beautiful ! " " It was Tahquitz . This was his house . " My father looked up sharply . " What do you mean ? His house ? " " Francisco told me . Nobody will live here because thisis the house of Tahquitz . He built it , they say , but whenthey returned , he went away and did not come back . " " Tahquitz ? What was he like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only in the night . " My father was thoughtful , but he studied the floor again as if he would find in its design the face of its maker . He pointed to the design that formed the border . " That purplish stone . That 's jasper . It comes in several colors . This is chalcedony . Both stones can be found in some of the canyons near the desert . " It is fine work . This Tahquitz or whoever it was is a fine craftsman . I should like to know him . " " You do not believe it was Tahquitz ? " He did not reply for a moment , and then he said , " This work is finely done by a man who loves what he is doing . I should like to know him . " THE LONESOME GODS 75Slowly the days went by and became weeks . SometimesI played in the yard , making friends with a very small blue lizard , and sometimes I wandered in the sand dunes . My father rested in the morning sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books Peter Burkin provided . Sometimes my father walked with me after the sun had gone down . Whenever we met Indians , they spoke to him respectfully , but they did not come to our house . My father did not leave the house without his pistol . " If you see any strangers , Hannes , come to me at once . I must know . " Another time he took me to the fireplace , where he had loosened a brick . Behind it was an iron box . " Tell nobody of this . Not your best friend , nor my best friend . In this box there is money . I have saved it since before you were born . If I should die or be killed , get this out , put the box and the brick back carefully , and hide the money . You will need it . " Later , after he had been reading to me from Quentin Durward , by Sir Walter Scott , I asked him if we would go to Los Angeles now . " Not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sun are good for me . I feel better and I have coughed much less . " " Will they come to look for us ? " " Yes , Hannes , they will . Do not forget them , ever . He is an old devil , that one . He will come , but now he is waiting , like the cat with the mouse . He is letting us get over being careful , when we think he will not come at all , then he will come . " My father looked at the bird in the center of the floor . " It is a raven , " he said , " and that is a curious thing . " Far to the south , farther yet than where we came to the Yuma trail , there is a place in the mountains called the House of Ravens . Only the Indians know it , but these later Indians do not often go there . " " What is there ? " Wait . Someday when I am feeling better , I will take76 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you are with an Indian . " He would say no more , and this I had learned of my father : when he ceased to speak , questions would lead him to speak no more . " You will be told in time . First , you have much to learn . " Later , when seated in the sun , he said , " This is an ancient land , older by far than the scholars believe . They trifle with years . They say that before this , nobody was here . They say the Indians have been here but a short time , and for some of them , that is true . " There have been men here for a million years and more . Before the great ice came , there were men here  --  and before the ice that was here before that . The wise men among us smile and say no , that men have been on this continent but a short time . " Who are they to say ? Have they dug deeply enough ? Have they looked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface ! They have a Garden of Eden complex , believing that all men came from one source ! " He coughed slightly , waited for a moment , and then said , " There are writings on the rocks , and some of the writings are from Indians whom we know , or their immediateancestors . Others come from a time far earlier , or have been borrowed from an earlier time . The Indians , just as we , have learned from those who passed this way before . " And there have been travelers , ships have come here many times , both from Europe and Asia . Chinese junks have come to our shores even in my time . " He sat silent , staring out the window at the mountains . " If they have come in my time , why not before ? " And they have , indeed they have ! You must learn to read Spanish , my son . I mean better than you do . Your mother started you , and you speak very well , but to read is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells of some Spanish soldiers encounteringsome Asiatics on the shores of the Gulf of California , who were trading with the Indians there , and THE LONESOME GODS 77seemed to think it no great thing , as if they had done so for years . He also speaks of Chinese ships making a landfallon the California coast . " My father sat silent , muttering a little . Then he sat up violently . " Confound it , son ! You must have an education ! It is time you were in school , but here there is no school ! In Los Angeles .. . " I must forget that . It is impossible . But read . There are books here , read them , all of them . Find others . Many a man has done well with no more of an education that what he can have by reading . " Your friend Francisco . He is an Indian and will know much you do not . " And when a month had gone by , Peter Burkin returned . He rode swiftly , watching over his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are coming . " 13hank you , Peter . Come in , please , and sit down . Will you have a cup of coffee ? " " There 's no time , Zack ! They ca n't be more than a mile or two behind me ! " " There 's time . Turn your horse into the corral and come in . " He lifted his own cup , and his hand was steady . " How many are there ? " " Five , at least . There 's maybe more . He 's got a way of sending a backup crew to circle around and come in behind . " Peter ducked outside , and I could hear him running as he led the horse to the corral and turned him in out of the way , saddle and all . When he came through the door , he was sweating , and it was still early and the air was cool . " We 've water piped into the house , Peter , and we 've food enough . This place is built like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal better time in here than they will out in the sandhills . So sit down . " Peter sat down , glancing uneasily out the doorway . " I know about the water . Ai n't often you see that . He must have figured on being trapped here sometime . " " That , or he did n't want to be seen . " " Who would see him out here ? Who but Injuns ? " My father shrugged . " Perhaps he just did not want to be seen . " " You do n't believe that Tahquitz stuff , do you ? " " I do n't know . After all , what is Tahquitz , if there is such a being ? It is just a name to cover a belief or an idea or a fear . " THE LONESOME GODS 79He turned to me . " Hannes , I 'd like it if you 'd get back in a corner and sit down on the floor behind the bed there . " " I want to be with you . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you 're told . " " I could load your guns . " " Maybe . Later . " Peter looked at me , smiling a little . " The boy ai n't scared , is he ? " " He 's my son , " Papa said , and I was suddenly very proud . But I was scared . . . a little . We heard their horses ' hooves on the hard-packed yard . I hoped my blue lizard was hiding . " Halloo , the house ! " My father went to the door , glancing from the window as he went toward it . " They do n't know for sure that it 's me who is here , " he commented to Peter . " No use keepingthem in doubt . " He opened the door . He did not step outside , but simply stood in the door , perhaps a foot inside , waiting . " You , there ! " The speaker was a burly Anglo in a striped shirt . " We 're huntin ' Zachary Verne . You seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , " my father replied mildly , " not since I got up . " " He 's here , then ? He 's been here ? " " Oh , he 's here , all right . " My father was smiling . " I think he 's going to be around for the next few weeks , anyway . Over his shoulder he spoke in a lower tone . " Peter ? Cover the rear of the house , if you will . " " You say you saw him ? When was that ? " " This morning , when I looked in the mirror . I was shaving . " It took them a minute . One of the Mexicans behind the Anglo said , " It is heem ! He is the one ! " " You ? You 're Zachary Verne ? " My father simply stood there , smiling a little , and then suddenly he said , " Well ? What did you come for ? " 80 LOUIS L'AMOUR " I came to ki  --  ! " Even I , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clumsy at it . He started to lift the rifle which he held across the saddle in front of him , and my father shot him . Without haste , he shot the third man , for the second , the one who had been quickest to recognize him , had gone around the house . Peter 's gun boomed , and as he started to load it , I took it from his hands and showed him the shotgun , which he took . Careful to spill no powder , I reloaded Peter 's rifle and then crossed to stand behind my father , but those who had been about to attack were gone . One man , the Anglo , lay sprawled on the hard earth where I had drawn Francisco'spicture . There were spots of blood where another had bled , and two riderless horses stood in the yard . Suddenly a horseman spurred by us at a dead run down the lane , and my father watched him go , gun in hand . " No use to shoot him , " my father said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will come back . " " He 's lost some fingers , " Peter Burkin said . " He dropped on the far side of his saddle , so I shot off the pommel and took some fingers with it . " " Thank you , Peter . " My father turned to me . " And thank you , Hannes . You are very cool . I like a man who does n't lose his head . " My father sat down suddenly , as if exhausted . He looked at Peter and shook his head . " I do n't have the strength anymore , Peter . I lack stamina . " " You 're lookin ' better . " Peter walked over and closed the outer door . " No matter what you may think , this air 's good for you . " " Possibly . " Peter went out , and when I looked again , the body was gone and the spots of blood had disappeared . When we were alone , my father said , " To kill a man is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have killed me , and you , so I had no choice . I hope this will be an end to it . " " Who was he , Papa ? He is not the don ? " THE LONESOME GODS 81 " No , just a man hired to kill , as they all were . " " Is the don afraid , that he does not come himself ? " " No , he is not afraid . I do not believe he knows fear . Perhaps he has never had occasion to be afraid . He hires such work to be done , just as he would hire a man to break horses or trap coyotes . " It was almost a month before Peter Burkin rode again to our house at the end of the lane . He rode a fine bay gelding and sat well in the saddle , and he brought a sack of good things to eat and three books . " Got ' em from a ship 's master , " he said . " Your pa dearly loves reading , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mite of tradin ' now and again . This time I had me some sea-otter pelts , prime fur . I made him throw in the books as boot . " He stripped the gear from the bay , talking the while . " He remembered your pa , and his pa before him . You come from a seafarin ' family , boy . Your pa was more'n seven years at sea before he come to California . Get him to tell you about those places he went to . " My stars ! When I hear him talk , his words are like a song my ears have been wanting . He sailed afar , boy , to places with names like music : Gorontalo , Amurang , Soerabaja , Singapore , Rangoon , Calcutta , Mombasa , and places like that . I d'clare , I could sit and hear him talk forever . It 's no wonder Consuelo fell in love with him . The way I hear it , half the girls in California were in love with him . He was a talker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corral and put his saddle and gear in the small barn . " Listen to me , boy , and gather memories while you can . They come easily now and will warm an old man 's heart when the time comes . " Do not forget the lasses who were good to you along the years . Remember their eyes and their laughter and the way they were with you . It is a good thing not to forget . And remember the shadows on the hills at sunset or in the dawning . " He paused . " Your father is better ? " " I think so . He seems to cough less , but he coughs . " " Aye , it is a miserable thing , the lung disease . Stay in82 LOUIS L'AMOURthe fresh air , boy . " He looked around at me , taking off his chaps . " Have you seen the Indian lad ? " No . " Do not worry about it . He will come again . They are strange folk , Indians . Perhaps not so strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know his father , too . He 's an important man among them . " " Will you come in ? " " Of course I shall . Am I interrupting , then ? " " My father reads to me at this hour . Less than he used to because of the coughing , but he reads . " " Good ! He can read to me , too . If it 's Scott or Byron , I 'll prove a good listener . Or Shakespeare . There was a cowhand once who said that Shakespeare was the only poet who wrote like he 'd been raised on red meat . " " Shakespeare ? " my father said when asked . " Not today , I think . This is a day for Homer . You will like him , Peter . His people were very like those around us now . Achilles or Hector would have done well as mountain men , and I think Jed Smith , Kit Carson , or Hugh Glass would have been perfectly at home at the siege of Troy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mind something of Troy . That 's where they fought that war over a woman . Helen , was n't it ? " " She was the excuse , Peter . Troy controlled travel from the Black Sea into Mediterranean waters , and the Greeks wanted to be rid of Troy . If it had not been Helen , they would have found another excuse . " Those were the wonderful , beautiful days ! My father grew better . The clear dry air seemed good for him , and he began to take walks with me , and sometimes to ride . Yet never without a rifle and a pistol . We saw the Indians from time to time . Once I saw Francisco , and waved . He stood watching us ride away , yet I continued to look , and finally he waved . My father talked of the desert , of books and men and ships . Peter Burkin returned and rode with us . He was worried about the old don , and warned my father . " He 'll try again . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 83you 're here , just among Indians . If you started for Los Angeles .. . " He do n't want you there , no way . " He rode in silence , then added , " After what happened here , nobody is very anxious to try you . At first it seemed like money found , just to ride out here and kill a man already sick . " When that first outfit came back with one man dead and two wounded , those who might have tackled you were short on enthusiasm . " My father tired quickly , so sometimes we sat down right where we were and talked . When he grew tired , his cough was worse . Often he spoke of the Indians , of how they lived and of their beliefs . " We do wrong , " he said , " to try to convert them to our beliefs . First we should study what they believe and how it applies to the way they live . First they must be sure of our respect . " " Francisco does not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the house of Tahquitz . " " It was another thing , I think . " My father waited , watching the cloud shadows on the desert . " I spoke of the Indian I saw at the Indian well . The old man who wore turquoise . " " You really saw such an Indian ? " " I do not know if he was an Indian . I thought he was . " There was a time when I said nothing , and then I said , reluctantly , for I did not wish to be thought a fool , " I do not know where he was standing . I have thought of it since . " " I do not understand . " " At the foot of the steps , beside the water , there is a flat place of hard earth . I stood there . When I took a drink , I looked around and he was standing there . " " Beside you ? " " Facing me . He was standing where there is no place to stand . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink , in the dipper . He just looked at me . " " And then ? " 84 LOUIS L'AMOUR " You called . " My father was silent for some time and then he said , " Hannes , we know so little . Our world is far stranger than anyone has guessed . We know a little and scoff at much we do not understand , but the Indians are either a simpler people or one far more complex who merely seem simple . " There are trails in the desert , and mountains , Hannes , trails the Indians no longer follow . Here and there , for a little way , they use them . The trails were made by the Old Ones , the people who were here before the Indians . We do not know who they were or what became of them , and some of the white people do not believe in them at all . The fathers at the missions have told the Indians it is nonsense and they must riot speak of them . " " These Indians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians . Some of them go to Pala occasionally , but usually they return here . No priests have come here yet . " " Where do the trails go ? " " Nobody knows . To water , probably . Sometimes I believethey go to hidden places where there is writing on the rock walls . " " What does the writing say ? " " Often it is only a few pictures of animals , sometimes there is more . We do not know what it means . " " I shall find out . I want to know what it means . " " There are trails no Indian will follow . Someday you may go , but first there is much to learn . " My father got up . " It grows late . Now we will go home . " There were sandhills and cactus where we were , and there was scattered brush . The sun was going down . Somethingmoved in the sand and started a small trickle down the dune toward us . Looking up , I saw nothing . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I like it . Will we stay there ? " " If he comes to claim it , " my father said , " we will give it up , although I like it , too . " He paused to rest . " It shows much love , that house . It shows the love of a man for his THE LONESOME GODS 85materials and his creation . It is a thing to be respected . There is beauty in the house , " he added , " and I envy the skill of the builder . " I thought of the trickling sand . It was probably a lizard . " Will he come back , do you think ? " " Who knows ? " My father took my hand . " Come , we must get home . I am suddenly very tired . I wish ... " They were there , waiting for us in the yard . There were four of them . The first was an old man with white hair and a stern face . His eyes were mean and cruel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Sir ? " My father 's tone was calm , although he must have heard the men behind us . " Let the boy go . He is a child . " " Kill the cur , " the old man said , " and kill the whelp . Do it now ! " He turned sharply away as he spoke , and my father shoved me hard away and to the ground , and he drew . His right hand was shoving me from danger , so he drew more slowly . He was hit twice  --  I saw it  --  before he could fire . He fired then , once , and a man fell . His second shot cut a nick in the corner of our door , and then he fell . " Be sure he is dead . " The old man spoke quite calmly . " Such carrion is harder to kill than a snake . " Men came around my father and shot into his body . One of them turned his pistol to me . " Not here , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us and leave him in the desert . It is better so . " A man grabbed me , and I kicked him . He slapped me hard across the face , smiling past his mustache . " Try that again and I 'll cut off your ears before we leave you . He had a scar across the bridge of his nose , a livid scar that must have almost cut it in two . He was one of those who shot my father as he lay on the ground . " Take him , " the old man said impatiently . " We must be gone . The Indians will come . " 86 LOUIS L'AMOUR " We will kill them , too , " said the man with the scar . " You are a fool ! They are many , we are few . Always , " he added , " they have liked him as if he were one of their own . Holding me tight , the man with the scarred nose twisted my arm and smiled when I winced . " Maybe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then we shall see you cry . When I move , you will tremble . When I lift a hand , you will scream . It was almost dark now , and they rode swiftly , avoidingtrails . There were nine of them besides the old man . One was a young man , very handsome , very cold . He had looked at me with contempt . Now he said to the old man , " At last it is done . When this one is dead , it will be finished . " " Leave him to me , " the scarred one said . The old man turned sharply . " Silence ! He will die . We will leave him in the desert . " " We are riding east ! " the young man said suddenly . " It is the wrong way ! " " It is the right way , " the old man said impatiently . " The Indios will believe we are returning through the pass . They will ride after us . They can not see our tracks , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was a faint light in the sky when they stopped . It was an empty place of flat sand and broken rock and cactus . All around , as far as I could see , there was nothing but a few great boulders and the empty desert . " Here , " the old man said . " Leave him . He is of my own blood , after all . If he dies  --  " " Kill him now , " the younger man said . " Leave him dead . " " I will not , " the old man said stubbornly . " Leave him . Let the desert do it . I will not destroy my own blood even if it is mingled with that of scum . Leave him . " The man with the scarred nose pulled me free of the saddle and dropped me , then sharply turned his horse so that it would trample me , but I rolled away , then ran and hid among some stones . THE LONESOME GODS 87 " Leave him ! " the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger , I stood up among the rocks . " Good-bye , Grandpa ! " I shouted . He winced as if struck , and his shoulders hunched as from a blow . He started to turn , but the young one said , " It is an insolent whelp ! Like the father ! " They rode away , and I was alone. 14I was in the desert . I was alone . To myself I whispered , " I am Johannes Verne , and I am not afraid . " My father was dead . They had killed him , and they had left me to die . I was not going to die . I was going to live . I was going to live and make them wish they were dead . The faint light in the sky had increased . I stood by the rocks where I had gone to hide , and I looked around . Everywhere was desert , sand and bare rock . Here and there was cactus . Those who brought me here had ridden all night , and they had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only east . It did not matter . I would follow their tracks . How far had we come ? They had traveled at a good gait , slowing to a walk from time to time , but most of the time at what my father called a shambling trot . I knew something of distance , for we had counted the miles westward from Santa Fe . Mr. Farley had often spoken of how far he must go each day , or how far he had come . I suspected they had brought me forty miles into the desert . Those who rode horses thought it a lot to walk , but I had walked behind the wagon sometimes and I did not think it was so far . It would be hot . If I was to walk , it must be now when the air was cool . Mr. Farley had rested his horses during the hottest part of the day . He would only begin to travel when the sun was down . When it was cool , I would walk ; when it was hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun. 88THE LONESOME GODS 89Where ? I did not know . What would Francisco do ? He would do as I was doing . He would walk . What else ? There were the tracks of their horses in the sand . I could follow them back to the house of Tahquitz . Turning slowly around , I looked at where I was . It was a place to start from , a place to begin . In a few days I would be seven years old . In a few years I would be old enough , and then I would go calling . There were three men I would visit . The old don , the young handsome one , and he of the scarred nose . It was a thing to live for . My mother had taught me never to hate . Hate would destroy him who hated . Nevertheless , I would hate . My mother was gone , my father had been murdered , I had nothing else . My legs were short . I wished they were longer , and tried stretching my steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks were there , sometimes plain , sometimes faint . My father had taught me a little of tracking , but here it was not needed . The tracks of ten horses were plain . I had no water . We had stopped at no spring . I had not been this way before . I did not know where water could be found . I was thirsty , but not enough thirsty to worry . I would wait , and walk . " I am Johannes Verne , " I said aloud . " I am not afraid . " Then the strangeness came . Suddenly I stopped and looked all around . The sand was almost white , the rocks that had seemed black now were brown , the sky was very blue and there were no clouds . I should have been afraid , but I was not . All about me seemed familiar , although I had seen none of it before , and had ridden through it only in darkness . I sat down on a flat rock . This was where I belonged . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lived with it , in it , had loved it and its people . Maybe that was it , but there was something more , too . I felt that I was born for this , to live here , to be a part of it . When I began to walk again , I did not hurry . Soon I must seek shade , and before night I should have to find90 LOUIS L'AMOURwater . Yet the strangeness was upon me , the feeling that I was not alone , a feeling that the desert was a friendly place . A jackrabbit started up and bounded away , then stopped , sat up , and looked at me . Then I saw where a snake had crossed the sandy trail , and some kind of bug had crossed over the snake 's trail . It was growing hot . In the sky , no longer quite so blue , but misty with heat , there was a buzzard . He had seen me and was watching . " Go away ! " I said aloud . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , but he would not have believed me . I remembered what my father had said , that the buzzard has only to wait . In the end , we all come to him or his like . I began to look for shade . There was none . I thought of pulling brush and piling it over a place where I could crawl for shade , but everything was stiff and dry and covered with thorns or stickers . The shadows of the Joshua trees were short . It would be nearing midday and there was no shade . My mouth was very dry . I picked up a little pebble and held it in my hand until it was not so hot , and then put it in my mouth . It would help for a little while . I stumbled . Some kind of small bird had run ahead of me in the sand . Far off , to the south and a little west , there seemed to be mountains . Were they our mountains ? They must be . How far I had walked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the shadows it was midday , and I had been walkingsince just before daylight . Jacob Finney had talked to me about the desert , as had Mr. Farley and Mr. Kelso , and of course , my father . I knew I must find shade and rest . A man or a boy could not live long without water . The trail of tracks I was following dipped down into a dry wash , and the opposite side was steep . By the time I climbed out of the wash , I was very tired . And then I saw the rocks . It was only a small clump of rocks , but they were heaped together and one of them made a shelf that held a little shadow . When I was closer , I could see a holeTHE LONESOME GODS 91behind it . Carefully , because of snakes , I inspected it . Taking a stick , and careful before I picked it up to be sure it was a stick and not a snake , I prodded into the shallow hole . Nothing ... . Crawling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . A crack toward the back let a small breeze come through . It felt good . Finally I must have slept , because when I opened my eyes it was cooler and I could see the sun was down . Crawling out , I looked all around . There was nothing but the desert . Keeping the stick with which I had prodded for snakes , I started to walk . A little sand had sifted into the tracks . They were no longer so plain . Suddenly I was afraid . What if the tracks disappeared ? Stopping , I remembered what Jacob Finney had said . " Always take your bearings . Locate yourself . " I knew where the sun had gone down , which would be west . So I was facing south . Far away I could see a jagged point of rock , and it was due south . Walking on , night came , and I chose a star that hung in the south right over my point of rocks ; then I walked on . The desert is cold at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , stumbling once in a while . A coyote howled and I took a firmer grip on my stick . It was a good strong stick . My mouth was very dry . Sometimes it was hard to swallow . I took deep breaths of the cool , clear air , which seemed almost like water , it was so fresh . Once I almost fell asleep walking . When I found a flat rock , I sat down . The coyotes seemed close , and I wondered if they were following me . Somebody had said they did not eat people . My father laughed at that . They were carnivores , he said , and would cat anything available . They were afraid of the man-smell because it meant danger , but they would attack anything they might eat if it could not fight back . If a man or a child is helpless , my father said , he might be eaten . Jacob Finney had agreed. 92 LOUIS L'AMOUR " No animal has any special respect for man , " he said . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose their fear , a man has to be careful . " Clutching my stick , I waited . If one came close , I would hit him . Bending over , I gathered some rocks . They were black against the white sand . I piled them beside me on the flat rock . Sometimes I dozed , yet I tried to stay awake , and several times I heard something moving , but I could n't see anything . A small wind stirred , rustling the dry leaves on the brush . Something stirred again , closer . I picked up a rock and threw it hard . After that I heard no sound . A long time later I awakened from dozing and heard a soft sound , so I took my stick and hit the brush near me ; then I threw another stone into the darkness . In stories , they always spoke of gleaming eyes peering from the darkness . I saw no eyes . I heard only the soft rustling of something moving in the darkness . When the first gray light came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very tired . Also I was hungry , but mostly I wanted a drink . The coolness of the night had made it better , but I wanted a drink , I needed a drink . Papa had said one could get a drink from a barrel cactus , but I did not see any . Just stiff , dry wood and sometimes whitish-looking grass . My point of rock was gone . My star was gone . I could not find the tracks , yet I could see where the sun was rising and I started off to the south . I had not gone far when I saw a coyote track in the sand . It was a fresh track . When I topped a small rise , I sat down . My legs ached and I was very tired . I put a pebble in my mouth again , but it did not work very well . The sun had come up , and it was very hot . Heat waves shimmered on the desert , and far ahead I could see a blue lake that was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beyond them I could see the mountains , the San Jacintos they were called , but they seemed far , far away . THE LONESOME GODS 93Then , walking on , I found the tracks again . Following them , I fell down , and when I got up from the sand , my hands were bloody from the gravel . There were other , older tracks . I was on some kind of a trail , and it seemed to dip down into the hotter desert , but beyond were the mountains . My tongue was dry and I could not swallow . My eyes hurt and I was very hot . I wanted to lie down , but the sand was like a hot stove . For a time there was a sound , a drumming sound , and then it became the sound of horses , and I turned around . A half-dozen riders were coming at me . Was it a dream ? My eyes blinked slowly , and I frowned , trying to make them out . They were only a blur against the shimmering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormouslylong , but that was the heat waves again . They came up , coming out of the heat waves and the dust , and the foremost rider had a wooden leg . They pulled up , and the man with the peg leg said , " Holy Jesus ! It 's Verne 's boy ! " He dropped from the saddle , amazingly agile , and held his water bag to my lips . A sip and a swallow , then he took it away . " Just rinse your mouth this time , " he said . " Let it soak in a mite . " After a moment he said , " Where you comin ' from , boy ? Where 's your pa ? " " They killed him , " I said . " They were waiting for him . He tried to push me away so I would not be hurt , and they shot him . " " He git any of them ? " another man asked . " One , I think . " Peg-Leg gave me another swallow and then stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Come on , son , " he said . " We 'll take you in . " Then he hesitated . " Your pa 's dead , boy ? What 'll you do now ? " " I want to go to our house . Peter Burkin will come . " " Reckon he will , at that . Pete 's a loyal man . " Peg-Leg started off , leading the way . " You got grub in that house , boy ? You got some'at to eat ? " " Yes . " 94 LOUIS L'AMOURWe rode on for a little way , and then he stopped and let me have a drink , stopping me before I drank too much . " We come on your trail , boy , " Peg-Leg told me . " We follered you . You come quite a stretch , you surely did . " He looked down at me . " You got anybody in Los Angeles , boy ? " " No , sir . " Then I said , " Maybe Miss Nesselrode . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's quite a woman ! " He turned in his saddle to speak to the others . " Said if I stole any of her horses she 'd hang me ! " He chuckled . " By damn , I think she 'd do it , too ! That there was some kinda woman , boy . When the time comes , you find yourself a woman like that . Ai n't none any better . " A long time later , after the drum of hooves and my own tiredness had made me fall asleep , we rode up the lane toward our house . All was dark and still . " Tom ? " Peg-Leg said . " Take a look inside . See if there 's anybody there . We 'll cover you . " Tom swung down , and , gun in hand , walked over to the door and lifted the latch . He stepped inside . A moment , and we could hear him fumbling about for the candles ; then light streamed out the door . His boots went from room to room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's clean as a whistle , Peg ! " Peg-Leg lowered me to the ground . " You 'll be all right here , boy ? You an ' them Injuns get along ? " " Yes , sir . " " I know they set store by your pa . You get some sleep now , boy . Drink a mite now an ' again , but do n't tank up until tomorrow . Then you 'll drink more'n you ever thought a man could hold . " An ' , boy ? You be careful of that of Spanish man . He hears you 're alive , he 'll come back for you . He 'll skin you alive . " For a moment longer he stayed , and then he said , " You see , boy , I das n't stick around . I 'm a man with enemies . There 's some as would hang me in a minute if they come upon me . I d'clare , boy , I 'm goin ' to pack it in an ' head north . This here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canTHE LONESOME GODS 95make a good livin ' up there in Frisco sellin ' maps to that gold mine folks think I lost . " He turned . " See you , boy ! I 'm right sorry about your pa . He was a good man ! " For a long time I stood alone in the yard near where my father had fallen , listening to the receding sound of their horses . Then I went inside and looked around . I was alone in the house of Tahquitz . Would he be angry that I was here ? Would he come to drive me away or kill me ? What was Tahquitz ? Who was he . . . or it ? I was very hungry , yet I did not want to eat . I straightenedmy bed , undressed slowly , then crawled into bed . For what seemed a long time , I lay still , staring into the darkness above me . Somewhere far off there was a low rumble , and the earth seemed to shake a little . Was it Tahquitz ? Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only home I had . What would I do now ? What could I do ? Would Peter ever come again ? And why should I matter to him ? I was not his boy . He had business of his own to see to . A low wind moaned around the eaves , and sand rattled against the windows and ran nervous fingers along the roof . Miss Nesselrode had said I could come to her , but if I did , I should be close to my enemies and they would know I was alive ; and that they must not know . To Los Angeles was a ride of five or six , maybe seven days . I did not know just how far . What could I do ? I could stay . I could live here , in the house of Tahquitz . At least , until he returned ... . 15When morning came I went to the cupboard . There was bread in the breadbox , there were two jars of jam , and there was cornmeal , two bottles of wine which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not drink either . At least , not often . I found in the cool place under the floor a big hunk of cheese , so I cut off a piece and returned the rest to the cloth wrapping and the open jar . With the cheese and a piece of bread thickly covered with jam , I sat down by the table and ate . Until then I had not realized how hungry I was . Before , I had only wanted water . When I had eaten , I went to the door , and Francisco was there . " You do not see Tahquitz ? " " No , " I said . " He was here . He covered the blood . " Francisco pointed to the place where my father had fallen . " Then he went away . " What was he like ? " " I did not see him . Nobody sees him . He comes in the night , and he goes . He was heard . " Francisco looked at me . " He was in the cabin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there ? He had been inside ? " What do you do ? " " What ? " " You can come with us . You can become an Indian . " " But I am not an Indian . " " You can live like Indian . " He glanced at me from theTHE LONESOME GODS 97corners of his very black eyes . " You can eat like Indian . At least , " he added , " you can eat . " I could eat . When the bread was gone , and the jam and cheese , what would I do ? Father had told me that the Cahuilla collected acorns , that they were an important part of their diet . They also collected chia and other seeds . " I must stay here . Peter Burkin will come . Then I will go with you and you will teach me what to do . " Francisco stood up , and then for the first time I saw the buckskin bag he had . He held it out . " Is for you . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if the word were not familiar . Peering into the bag , I could see the pieces of dried meat . " Gracias , " I said , and he smiled , showing his white teeth . " I go now , " he said . He walked away , and after a moment I went back inside . Tahquitz had been here ! Standing just inside the door , I looked all about me . If Tahquitz was here , what did he do ? Why would he come ? To see his home , if this was his house ? To see what we did here ? Nothing was changed , nothing was different . Carefully , going from room to room , I looked for what he might have done here , and I found nothing . Anyway , I did not believe in Tahquitz . He was a story , like " Cinderella " or " Jack the Giant-Killer . " Even the Cahuillas had not seen him ; they had heard him , which was not the same . It could have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . Papa 's rifle stood in a corner , and I went to see if it was loaded . It was . His pistol belt had been hung on a peg in the bedroom , and I took it down . It was loaded , too . Somebody had loaded it , because my father had fired it . Somebody had loaded it while I was gone . Taking the pistol belt from the peg , I hung it on the bed . It would be close to me at night , if I needed it . I had98 LOUIS L'AMOURshot a pistol , but only with my father helping me . I had shot a rifle , too . Remembering what my father had done , I got the broom and swept the cabin floor . Then I wiped the windows clean and dusted the furniture . In the desert there is much dust . When the house was clean , I filled the bucket with fresh water and filled a water bag and let it hang in the wind to keep cool . Chewing on a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the books . Quentin Durward was the book my father was reading . I would try to .. . It was gone ! There were twelve books on the shelves , and I had looked often at each , but Quentin Durward was not among them . Yet there were still twelve . I looked again , and the book that replaced Quentin Durward was another novel by Scott , Guy Mannering ! Hesitantly I took the book down , and as I opened the pages , I caught a faint odor of pine needles . Holding it to my nose , I sniffed curiously . Definitely pine , but our books had been nowhere near any pine trees . Very carefully , half-frightened , I put the book down . Who had been here since we had been gone ? Tahquitz , Francisco had said , but that was nonsense . There had been someone else ; someone had been in our house , had taken one of our books and left another , hopingno doubt that we would not notice . Especially that I would not notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a boy of my age should read such books , but my father and mother had both taught me , and I had begun reading at an early age , after my parents had read to me . Why bother to substitute a book at all ? Why not just push them together , hoping no one would notice there was one fewer on the shelf ? Again I picked up the book , slowly turning the pages . I turned almost a third of the book , page by page , but there was no clue . The odor of pine needles remained , THE LONESOME GODS 99and there were no pines here . The only trees here were palms , smoke trees , and a few palo verde . In some of the canyons there were sycamores . Uneasily I put the book down again . Yet , why not read it ? Quentin Durward was gone , but the new story might be quite as good . Yet I put the book down for the time and went outside . The horses came to me eagerly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did so . They had water running into a trough , so that was something I did not have to do , yet they were my responsibility now , and I must not forget . But who had fed them when I was gone ? Francisco , no doubt , or one of the other Indians . Turning , I stared up at the looming San Jacinto Mountains , rising so steeply from the desert . If Tahquitz lived up there , why would he come down here ? It was high , and must be cooler . Cool enough that there might be pines . The thought frightened me , and I went quickly inside . My feet were very sore and there were places where my heels had chafed during the walk . I bathed them again and lay down , trying to think what Papa would have wanted me to do . I was half-asleep when I heard a horse . I heard the clop , clop-clop of hooves and got quickly up , wide-awake . I looked to the pistol and went to stand beside the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into sight , and it was Peter . I put down the pistol and ran outside . " Howdy , boy . Is it true , then ? " " Yes , sir . There were many of them . He pushed me out of the way before he got his pistol out . " " He git any of them ? " " Yes , sir . One , I know . " He dismounted and I went with him as he walked his horse back to the corral . He watered his horse , then tied it and took his rifle from the scabbard . We walked back to the house with the sunshine on the peaks . Inside , he got out the pot and made coffee as I told him what had happened and how Peg-Leg Smith had found me and brought me in. 100 LOUIS L'AMOUR " He 's a cantankerous old devil , but he 's a good man to have around if you 're in a corner . " He looked at me . " How you doin ' , all by yourself ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Cahuilla . They spoke of it . " " You ai n't got no other folks , I know . Your pa said something about this Nesselrode woman ? " " She was in our wagon coming west . She said she would take me , but she may have been just talking . Anyway , I want to stay here . " " Here ? Alone ? Well , I was on my own when I was nine , and I had n't as much savvy as you . I brought you some grub . It 's in those sacks back of my saddle , but that ai n't much , an ' I 'm not sure I can keep makin ' this trip . " " It is a long ride . " " I got to make a livin ' , boy . " He looked around . " No place for you there . It 's a mighty rough neighborhood where I live , and all I 've got is a bunk in a cheap roomin ' house with a bunch of drinkers an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to stay . " " Mind if I sleep here tonight , boy ? I 'm surely tuckered . " He looked at me again . " You ai n't scared they 'll come back ? " " They think I am dead . " " Well , you ai n't . No tellin ' how long before they find out . " He paused again . " You seen anything of that there Tahquitz ? " No . Peter stoked his pipe with tobacco , waiting for the water to boil . " Any of that bunch get inside ? I mean those folks who killed your pa ? " " No . They killed him , took me , and rode away . They did n't even look inside . " Peter 's chuckle was not amused . It was a dry chuckle concerned with something in his mind . " Give ' em a shock if they had , " he said . He did not say anything more , and I did not know what he meant . Sometimes I had a feeling Peter knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books , he asked , " Can you read them ? I reckon you 're a mite young . " " I can read them . Some words I do not know , but if I think , I can find their meanings . Papa and Mama started teaching me when I was three . We traveled a lot and I was with them all the time . " " Well , I brought you some more . I do n't know what they are , but a man in town who reads a lot , he said they were good . " He pulled off his boots and sat on Papa 's bed looking at me . " Got to get you an eddication . Your pa had it . He knew everything , I reckon . Me , I never had no schoolin ' to speak of . I can read a mite , an ' I can cipher , sign my name , and the like . " Read them books , boy . Learn something . I got no eddication , and all I can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mite , trap a little fur . It ai n't much more than a livin ' , son , so you get you an eddication . " He dumped some coffee into the pot . " I better find that Nesselrode woman . She will know what to do . " " I want to stay here . I like it . " He smoked and we drank coffee and after a while he pulled on his boots again and went out to the horse and took off its saddle and turned it into the corral . He brought the saddle inside , then , the sacks of supplies . " There 's enough here to last you awhile if you use care . You know how to make flapjacks , boy ? No ? Well , that 's one thing I can teach you ! Nobody makes no better flapjacksthan I do , and I 'm a fair hand with bakin ' - powder biscuits , too . " He sat staring at the floor . Finally he said , " That there 's work ! I mean , he who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what he did . " He glanced around uneasily . " Kinda spooky place , ai n't it , boy ? I mean , with that Tahquitz an ' all . I never set much store by such things , Injun things , but some of them knew a whole lot we 'll never know . Good people , too , although I never knowed ' em like your pa did . " That black bird , now ? Here in the floor ? See those red102 LOUIS L'AMOUReyes ? Those are garnets , boy . Some folks think they 're rubies , but no such thing . Garnets . Out in the desert off to the north , there 's a crater . Injuns call it Pisgah or some such thing . There 's garnets there , boy . I found some . " He chuckled . " I showed ' em one time to a man in a saloon , he grabbed at ' em , studied them a mite , and then , makin ' like he did n't care , he offered me a price for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He figured they were rubies and I was too dumb to know the difference . He offered me a small price for them and I took them up and held ' em in my hand and told him no way . " They were pretty red stones , and I was going to give them to a woman I knew . Make nice beads , I told him . By that time he was sweatin ' . He wanted them stones so bad he could taste it . " I told him my woman would surely like them . I said , Why , I would n't part with ary one o ' them for less than a hundred dollars ! ' You know somethin ' , boy ? He jumped at it . That 's what he did . He fairly jumped at it . He gave me a hundred dollars apiece for three of them ! " Now , I wo n't rightly say I did the honest thing , but I never told him they was rubies . I never told him different . Was I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know a ruby when I seen it ? " He figured he was cheatin ' me , and I taken his money . Fact is , I get myself a fresh grubstake ever ' now and again , just that way . I go into a saloon or somewhere , maybe an eatin ' joint where there 's newcomers , and I take out those garnets and study them . Soon or late , somebody wants to buy ' em . " Just pretty red stones , ' " I says to ' em . " Ai n't worth nothin ' except to my woman . She 'll set store by them . ' " You know somethin ' , boy ? They try to talk me into sellin ' those red stones ! And you know somethin ' ? I must be gettin ' weak , because almost ever ' time they convince me to sell . With three hundred dollars I can prospect for a year , livin ' high on the hog . " Now , when I leave here , I 'm goin ' north to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for they ai n't so easy to find , but they are there . " THE LONESOME GODS 103Peter stayed for a week , teaching me how to make flapjacks , biscuits , and a few simple things , and I learned from him how to find gold , how to pan , what to look for . When he rode away , I did not know that it would be a long , long time before I saw him again. 16I n the passing of days , I rode often to the mountains or desert with Francisco , and often we accompanied his father and other Cahuillas who went to look at the acorn crop , for the oaks provided much of the living for the Cahuillas . It was important they be gathered at once or they would be eaten by squirrels or other animals and birds . Also , if the season was wet , they might rot on the ground before they could be gathered . We rode along the watercourses to judge the mesquite and screw-bean crops , or to see when the tuna would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant and what it offered in seeds , fruit , or pulp . On one day we came upon a dim , dim trail leading off into the remote distance , but when I pointed it out , they rode on their way . " It is a trail of the Old Ones , " Franciscoexplained . " You do not follow it ? " " It is their trail . We have our own . " " It might lead to water . " " It is their trail . " Yet only some of the trails were avoided , and I did not know why . Perhaps the water that had once been there was gone now , or the groves from which the Old Ones gathered had disappeared . And who were the " Old Ones " ? Each day I learned something new , and when we went to the desert and mountains , I watched which seeds were gathered and which plants were avoided . Having crossed the desert with my father , Mr. Farley , and the others , I had learned much , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 105which the Cahuilla lived , partly due to the range of altitudefrom below sea level to the top of the mountains at more than ten thousand feet , was richer in plants than those held by other Indians whose countries I had passed through . Occasionally we met other Cahuillas , and once a party of Chemehuevi , and all knew me because of my father . He had discovered their starving time and had come to them with beef cattle . Flash floods had swept away some of the mesquite groves upon which they depended , and dampness left by the rains had ruined the acorn crop , but the beef my father brought saved their lives . The days passed into months , and the months into years . In the house , I puzzled over the books , reading slowly , gradually becoming accustomed to the strange words , learning their meanings by their associations . Once a strange Indian came suddenly to the door , warning me of riders , and I slipped away into the dunes to watch . No doubt it was believed that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and perhaps rumors had come to him that somebody lived in this house . Once , when they would have entered the house , they were stopped by Cahuillas who rose like ghosts from the dunes , bows bent and rifles ready . The riders turned their horses and very wisely rode quietly away , expecting at any moment an arrow in the back and perhaps a pitched battle . The Cahuillas had followed them for several miles , making them aware their presence was not wanted . Yet I had not begun to understand the remoteness of the area in which I lived . The pass between the San Jacinto Mountains and Mount San Gorgonio was the best of all passes to the coast but was the last one found by white men . From a distance , approaching from the east , the high peaks loomed against the sky , seemingly an unlikely place for a pass . Once they had arrived , the Californios rarely visited the desert . Some of them had come by sea , others came over the inland route from Mexico that crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the desert and the Anza route over the mountains , which lay south of106 LOUIS L'AMOURthe pass where I lived . There simply was no reason for them to make the long , difficult journey from Los Angeles to the southern desert . Nor was there anything here they wanted , nothing to incline them to make the attempt . The hot springs from which Agua Caliente took its name had long been used by Indians , but the Californios had access to hot springs that were closer , and the existence of these was scarcely known . From time to time a book vanished from my shelf , but always another book took its place , and once during my first months alone a sack of pinon nuts was left on my table . Another time a loaf baked from some strange , nutty flour . Reading became easier , so I welcomed the strange books , but I was careful not to mention the exchanges of books to the Cahuillas , who might not have understood . Obviously , somebody was hiding out on the mountain who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me any harm . If he did not wish to be seen , it was his affair . When my father died , he left some six hundred dollars in gold coins . When the supplies dwindled away and Peter came no more , I took one of the coins from the iron box my father had hidden away to the small store to replenish the supplies . The storekeeper took my coin ; then , glancing around to be sure he was unheard , he said , " I ai n't askin ' you , boy , but if you got more of these , you 'd best not let folks know . Even the best people will talk , an ' there 's drifters come through who 'd kill a man for less than this . " He hefted the coin . " This here will buy you all you want and then some . You leave it with me , and when you are needful of something , just come an ' get it . I 'll tell you when I need more . " He seemed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion was logical , however , and I did as he proposed . Often alone , sometimes with Francisco , I wandered the fringes of the desert and deep into the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa mountains . Often I climbed in the canyons , occasionally staying out for days at a time . One day when alone I heard a horseman coming . TheTHE LONESOME GODS 107door was open to catch the coolness of the evening , so I took down my father 's pistol and stood in the doorway , holding it down by my side , only my shoulder , arm , and one eye showing . All my life I had been familiar with guns . Long ago I 'd been taught that all guns were to be considered as loaded and were to be handled with care , yet any rider might be an enemy . Yet when the rider came within sight , I almost dropped the gun . It was Jacob Finney ! Tucking the pistol behind my belt , I stepped outside . As soon as he saw me he began to smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Mind if I get down ? " " Please do , and come inside . " Leaving his horse ground-hitched , he came in , putting his hat on the floor beside him as he sat down . He noticed the pistol . " You expectin ' trouble ? " " Yes , sir . They killed my father . " " Heard of it . From what was said , he taken one or two with him . Well , that 's too bad . He was a mighty fine man . " " He would have taken more of them , but he tried to push me out of the way before he drew . " " Like him . " " How is Mr. Kelso ? " " Last I heard , he was workin ' a claim in the Mother Lode country . Farley 's got him a ranch down San Diego way . He looked at me again . " You 're a couple of shades darker from the sun . How old would you be now ? " " I am ten . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years older . You been takin ' care of yourself here ? " " Yes . The Cahuillas are friendly , and I spend a lot of time with them . Sometimes I eat with them , sometimes I cook , but usually I eat what they do . There 's pinon nuts , tuna , and sometimes berries . " " Surely ai n't doin ' you no harm . Seen the horses out yonder , too . You been ridin ' ? " 108 LOUIS L'AMOURSo I told him about the wild country , the desert , the ancient sea bottom , and the old shoreline that could be seen along the sides of the mountains . " I 've found lots of shells out there , old seashells from ages ago . The Cahuillas say the sea has been in there several times . Or maybe it was water from the Colorado . " " All right if I stay the night ? I 'm packin ' my own blanket roll . " " Sure . I 'll put up your horse . " " Leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no offense meant . " He got to his feet , turning his hat in his hands . " I come out here a-purpose to see you . Did n't know if you was alive or not , but Miss Nesselrode  --  you remember her ? She 's been mindful of you . Sent me to see if you were alive . Said she told your pa she 'd care for you . " He grinned . " Not that you seem to need much care . " He went outside and I started some coffee . It was good to see him . When he came in and dropped his gear in a corner , I asked , " How is Miss Nesselrode ? " He chuckled , giving me a sly , amused look . " Now , that there 's quite a woman , Hannes , she really is . Purty , too . She found herself a little adobe , bought a few odds and ends , and went to church , and the first thing you know , she 's been proposed to a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around town . She walks around with that lacy parasol of hers , and the first thing you know , she 's bought herself a horse an ' sidesaddle . " Seems she heard of some hard-up trapper who has ketched some sea otter . Saying nothin ' to anybody else , she had me buy those skins from him , at rock-bottom prices . Then she shipped them off to China . Meanwhile she heard of another man up the coast who had skins for sale , and she bought them , got them off on the same ship . " She 's right canny , that woman is . She hired Kelso an ' me to do the shippin ' for her , an ' she 's just a mighty pretty young woman , visitin ' around . " You know how womenfolks are , always talking of clothes , babies , marriage , an ' what 's happenin ' around . THE LONESOME GODS 109Well , she listens , she gets acquainted with the families of Abel Stearns , Isaac Williams , Wolfskill , an ' them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on Wolfskill 's advice she plants it to lemons an ' oranges . Then she has Kelso buy another piece , which she plants to grapes . " Los Angeles is a sleepy little town . A lot of ructions down in Sonora Town , time to time , but the Californios do n't much care what happens as long as they have a fandango now and again , good horses to ride , and money to spend on fancy clothes . " They 're good folks , but there 's never been any pressure on them until now . Times have changed , and most of them ca n't see what 's happenin ' . You 've heard talk of beaver . When folks over in France and such places switched from beaver hats to silk hats , the bottom fell out of the market . There just was n't any money in trappin ' or tradin ' for beaver anymore . " Now , some folks think the mountain men were just a bunch of big ignorant trappers . You an ' I know otherwise . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trappin ' because if a man kept his hair , that was the fastest way to get rich . " Now that beaver do n't bring no good prices , what do they do ? Keep ridin ' a dyin ' horse ? Not them . Some of them had already been out here with Jed Smith , Ewing Young , and the like , so they come out . They 've got a little money , a lot of savvy , and they commence buyin ' . Some of them married Spanish girls , but whatever they do , they are in business . " They open stores , banks , start plantin ' grapes to make wine , oranges , lemons , and such . Land is dirt cheap , so they buy land , most of them become Mexican citizens .

When I stop by , she always has coffee for me , but she does n't invite me for dinner anymore . It takes a while to sink in , and then I get it . She 's broke . She 's livin ' on guts and the few dollars she has left . She 's invested what all she had in a gamble , a damn big gamble ! " What I 'm talkin ' about is the first six months she was here .

She 's goin ' to open a bookstore . " " But you said she had no money . " He chuckled . " Like I said , that woman 's got nerve . Real , down-to-bedrock nerve ! She 's holdin ' a busted flush and she bets everything on her last card . " The next morning she goes to see Abel Stearns . Now , Abel , he 's a shrewd man an ' he 's got more money than he knows what to do with , an ' he 's made it all himself . " She goes to him and tells him she intends to open a bookstore and until her ' funds ' arrive from Boston , she is short of cash , but she wants to open the store now . When she walks out of there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few books of her own . She gets more . " That store becomes a gatherin ' place for all of that old mountain-man crowd and some others .

" Within a few weeks it is the place where Wolfskill , Workman , Rowland , Wilson , Stearns , and all that crowd come for news and to see each other . And she 's busy , workin ' around , but listening . I tell you , Hannes , withinTHE LONESOME GODS 111the next three months that woman knows more about what 's happenin ' in California than anybody ! " Stearns is n't hurting for money , she 's an attractive woman , so he does n't dun her . When she 's in business for about six months , she 's been in Los Angeles about a year , you understand , then her ship comes in . " I mean that ship comes back from China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ten times what she paid for them . She pays off Stearns and she 's free an ' clear with money to work with .

" She goes out to remote ranches which have a time gettin ' hides down to the shore where they can be sold to the ships . She buys cheap . " She lives like she always did , goes about her business with a friendly smile and a kind of wide-eyed innocence . She owns her bookstore building , she owns another buildingclose by , she owns a small ranch , some horses and cattle , and she operates her bookstore like it was a bank . That woman 's a caution !

When he does come in , he rides in like a king , with six or eight vaqueros riding along . " Jacob pulled off the boot and placed it on the floor . " She 'd give it out that you were kinfolk from back East . She has dealings with shipowners , ship captains , and the like . She could say you 'd just come around the Horn with one of them .

If you want to come back , nobody will stop you . " " I like this house , and some of the things belonged to my father . " " Leave ' em . I 'll speak to the old gent down at the store , and you can tell your Injun friends . " " They do not come here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " They say this is the house of Tahquitz . They think because I live here that I have a special power , that my medicine is very strong . " He knew nothing of the story of Tahquitz , so I told him the little I knew . He listened attentively , then said , " I ai n't one to scoff at superstitions . To my thinkin ' there 's always some truth to the stories you hear . " He pulled off the other boot . " Then this place will be safe . We 'll just leave any truck you do n't need . " Lying awake , listening to Jacob Finney snoring lightly in the other room , I wondered about Los Angeles . It had been long since I had visited a town , so long I scarcely remembered anything before Santa Fe except glimpses here and there , little things that clung to the memory . And Santa Fe was nearly four years ago . When morning came , I would take a hundred dollars in gold and leave the rest hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol and rifle . When I wanted to return , I could saddle up and ride . Traveling in the wild country was an old story now . Francisco appeared as I was putting the rifle in its scabbard . " You go ? " he asked . " To Los Angeles , " I said , a little proudly . " It is far , " he said . " Five days , " I said , " perhaps six . I am not sure . " " My papa was there . There are many big houses . " " No doubt . " " You will not come back . " " My home is here , in this house . My father is buried here . I will come back . " 114 LOUIS L'AMOUR " You will not come back . " His face was solemn . " You are my friend , Francisco . You will always be my friend . I shall come back to this house , and I leave my father 's things here . I leave even the books . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I valued them . " Perhaps you will come back . " So we rode away when the sun was touching the peaks of Mount San Jacinto and Mount San Gorgonio , and the pass we followed led into the darkness that lay between them . As we topped the first rise , I looked back at the scatteredpalms , the mesquite , and the few huts , even the flat roof of the store . My house was hidden among the dunes , and I wondered about my unknown visitor who borrowed books and left others . Well , he would be pleased , I thought , to find two new books on the shelf . I had found them among my father 's things and I placed them in the place from which he had last borrowed a book . Looking back , I could see the Leaning Rock at the mouth of Chino Canyon . Some named it the Calling Rock , and it is said that when one is away the Calling Rock calls you to return . It is also said that if you turn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . I looked long , for I wanted to come back . Francisco was there , and he was my friend . Jacob spoke of Los Angeles . " Is it by the sea ? " I asked , remembering my father had come to it on a ship . " No , it is twenty miles from the sea . At least twenty miles . " " Will we see the sea ? " " There are low hills and mountains from which it can be seen . There are islands far out across the water . You will see them . It is said that long ago the Chumash Indiansmade plank boats and went to the islands . They painted them red . I do not know why . " " My father told me of them . " " It was a custom , I suppose . Remember , now ! Tell no one you have come from the desert . Do not even speak of the desert . You have come by sea , newly arrived from theTHE LONESOME GODS 115States . Before we arrive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But they are small for me now , " I protested . " No matter . We will get others in Los Angeles . You have been months at sea . You would naturally have grown . You must be careful ! There is always talk , and even the gentes de razon have large ears . If it is discovered you are from the desert , if they know you are your father 's son , you will be in danger . " " I will remember . " After a few steps by the horses I said , " I have no friends in Los Angeles . To whom could I speak ? " " You will make friends . Also , there is Miss Nesselrode , and I , too , am your friend . Most people talk too much , anyway . We rode on , and my thoughts returned to words my father had spoken , for I was much with him , and being silent , I heard a great many things which I wondered about later . There was much I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew older . But there was much to think about when I was alone , and often I lay awake wondering about things that were said . There was a time when a man spoke very impatiently to my father . He had seen a copy of the Iliad lying on the table . " You are reading this ? " he asked . " I have read it many times . Now I read it to my son . " " But he is too young ! " The man protested , almost angry . " Is he ? Who is to say ? How young is too young to begin to discover the power and the beauty of words ? Perhaps he will not understand , but there is a clash of shields and a call of trumpets in those lines . One can not begin too young nor linger too long with learning . " Who knows how much he will remember ? Who knows how deep the intellect ? In some year yet unborn he may hear those words again , or read them , and find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago heard and only half-remembered . " Yet perhaps it is only that I like to hear those rolling cadences . People , I think , read too much to themselves ; 116 LOUIS L'AMOURthey should read aloud from time to time to hear the language , to feel the sounds . " Homer told his stories accompanied by the lyre , and it was the best way , I think , to tell such stories . Men needed stories to lead them to create , to build , to conquer , even to survive , and without them the human race would have vanished long ago . Men strive for peace , but it is their enemies that give them strength , and I think if man no longer had enemies , he would have to invent them , for his strength only grows from struggle . " My father had waved his hand about at the stark Arizonamountains and the desert where the wagon rested . " Homer sang of his wine-dark seas , ' but we , I think , will sing of these . You will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserts , and the mountains . Our Trojans may appear in feathered war bonnets , but none the less noble for them . Our Achilles may be Jim Bowie or some other like him , our Ajax might be Davy Crockett or DanielBoone . " My father was a tall man , and now he stood up . " My friend , " he said , " I do not know what else I shall leave my son , but if I have left him a love of language , of literature , a taste for Homer , for the poets , the people who have told our story  --  and by ' our ' I mean the story of mankind  --  then he will have legacy enough . " Was this , then , this ride to Los Angeles , was this like a voyage among the Greek islands ? Was this to be part of an epic ? If so , it was a dusty one ! And I was wishing Jacob would decide to rest the horses , because I was tired . Yet , looking over my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine sweep of mountains , and the pines that grew there . Again I remembered those long plains over which we had passed , the great tower and broken battlements of El Morro , the magnificent vistas of plain , mountain , and forest . Whatever else my father had given me , he had given me a chance to see these , to know them , to live with them . I thought of Francisco . Who had been his Homer ? What stories had he heard beside the campfire when the winterTHE LONESOME GODS 117winds chilled the flesh ? For it was in the winter the Indians told their stories . Over the fire that night , Jacob warned me , " Do n't you be expectin ' too much . It will remind you some'at of Santa Fe , but Miss Nesselrode , she says we should n't be fooled by it . She says Los Angeles will be a great city , an ' the best thing ever happened to it was when those beaver pelts fell in price . She told me one time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk hats that build Los Angeles , because when over in Europe they stopped wearing beaver hats and switched to silk , it started all of those very wise , very bold mountain men looking for new ways to get rich . ' " He added sticks to the fire . " Now , do n't you be judgin ' all Californios by your grandpa . By an ' large , there are n't any finer folks livin ' . Generous to a fault , give you the shirt off their backs , and do it graciously and with an air . " There 's another thing . They 're proud of bein ' Californios . They do n't consider themselves Spanish , nor do they think of themselves as Mexicans , although there 's plenty of those , too . They call themselves Californios , and although Los Angeles ai n't much , right now it is the biggest town in California , and you 'll see why they love it . " But she 's rough ! I mean , almighty rough ! There 's good folks aplenty , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you soon as look at you . " Pistol or knife , but mostly it 's knives in Sonora Town . Back to the east , when a man wants to do you harm , he takes up a shootin ' iron of some kind , but out here it can be a shootin ' iron or it can be a knife or anything handy . You got to remember that folks were killin ' each other with rocks and clubs for a million years before anybody invented a pistol . So be careful . Learn to handle yourself and to handle weapons , but mostly you just learn to guard your tongue . A man out here who speaks careless of others will soon only have a marker in the graveyard . " We had been lying in our blankets , and the last coals were smoldering when suddenly Jacob raised up on his elbow , knowing I was awake. 118 LOUIS L'AMOUR " You listen to Miss Nesselrode , boy . She ai n't no mountainman , but she 's one of those who will make the wheels turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set back an ' watch that woman operate . Ever ' time she flutters her lashes or turns her parasol , she 's figured out some new way to make a dollar ! " But I was not thinking of Miss Nesselrode , nor of my father ; I was just thinking of how wonderful it was to be riding west into a new land , and to be sleeping under the stars . My last thought was not of that warm and sunny place called Los Angeles , it was of my grandfather , the one who had my father killed and who created the fear with which I lived. 18The night was clear and cold , with many stars . The wind off the sea was fresh when we rode down to the water 's edge . Out upon the water we could see lights from a dark hulk beneath bare poles , a ship at anchor . " Brought you roundabout , Hannes . We 're ridin ' into town like I met you here as you come off the boat . We 'll stay the night down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rode toward a shack that stood back from the water 's edge near a small dock where two boats were tied up . There was a corral beside the house , with two horses already there . A single light was burning in the shack , and Jacob rapped on the door without dismounting . " Who 's there ? " " Jacob . It 's Jake Finney , Cap . " The door opened and a square-shouldered old man stared from him to me . " Is this the young rascal who sailed around from Bedford with me ? " " Yes , sir , " I said , " and a fine voyage it was , too , except for that bit of rough weather off the Horn . " The old man stared at me , and then he smiled . " Well ! He 's got a quick tongue , Jacob . Let 's hope he has the brain to go with it . " " I liked stopping at the Galapagos , " I said , enjoying it , " and the turtles we took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who did you say this lad was , Jacob ? " " Zachary Verne 's boy . Grandson of old Adam Verne , if you remember . " 119120 LOUIS L'AMOUR " Remember ? How could I forget him ? My first two voyages to the Pacific were made with him . Adam Verne 's grandson , eh ? Well , I 'll be damned ! " He took his pipe from his mouth . " Where 's your pa , boy ? I knew him well ? " " He 's gone , sir . Passed away . Murdered , actually . " " That 's why the trickery , Cap . The lad 's in danger . They believed they 'd done for him , too . " " Then why risk it , lad ? Come aboard my ship and you can sail to China . I 'll sign you on as cabin boy , and before long you 'll learn to navigate and be a ship 's masterlike your grandpa . " " Thank you , sir , but I am expected in Los Angeles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cap . She promised Zack Verne she 'd do that . " " Nesselrode , eh ? Well , I 'd not say it of another woman I know , but if she intends to see after the lad , it will be done . If there 's ever a woman should wear pants , it 's she . " " It would be a pity , sir , lovely as she is . " " Eh ? Oh , yes , of course . She 's a handsome woman . That 's the trouble , Jacob , dealing with a handsome woman is unsettling to a man . When he should have his mind on business , he 's thinkin ' of other things . " He stepped back . " Come in , lad . You an ' me can talk some while Jacob puts up the horses . " It was a long , low room with tiers of bunks along one side , all neatly made up . Directly ahead was a table and two benches , and on the left side a fireplace with a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bugs , I mean . You pick whichever suits you and dump your gear . " He seated himself at the table and reached down to the hearth for the coffeepot . " You drink coffee , lad ? I do n't think much of it for young folks , but there 's nothing else hot . " " I 'll have a bit , sir . Just a bit . " The captain knocked the ash from his pipe on the edge of the hearth and began to stoke it anew . " Knew your pa , but your grandpa better . They were good men , good men . " He struck a match and sucked on the pipe . " YourTHE LONESOME GODS 121pa was killed ? Must have taken some doin ' , as I remember him . He was a fightin ' man when need be . " " There were several of them , sir , and he took time to push me out of the way . He got at least one of them , wounded another , I think . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but always a thoughtful man . " The captain puffed at his pipe and glanced at me from quizzical blue eyes . " If you an ' Miss Nesselrode do n't hit it off , lad , you just be on the beach next time I come to port . You 'll be welcome aboard . You 've the sea in your blood , and I 'll see you 've a chance . " " Thank you , sir . " " That Miss Nesselrode , now . Jacob tells me you came west on the wagon with her . She get a case on your pa ? " " I do n't think so , sir . I think she liked him , maybe felt sorry for him . He was very sick , you know . " " A takin ' woman . Make some man a fine wife if he was up to it . It would take a strong man , a man sure of himself to cope with her . " She 's a pretty woman , lad , and pretty women sometimescan do things no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a pretty woman , no matter what she 's after . " Talked with her some . She come aboard , maybe two years or more ago , said she wanted to talk . Well , now , that old ship of mine is no lady 's boudoir . She 's a workin ' vessel , shipshape an ' neat , but no comforts , mind you . " No matter . She come aboard , drank coffee with me , and asked if I was sailin ' to China . " To China ? No such idea entered my head . I was buying cargo , selling what I brought , and contemplating another voyage to Hawaii , maybe . " China , she says , so I ask her why I should go to China . She smiles very nice  --  she 's got a lovely smile , that lady  --  and says to sell furs . That it is the best market for otter . " I tell her I do n't have any such skins and she gives me that smile and says , ' But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-two otter skins , some beaver , marten , and two hundred cowhides. ' 122 LOUIS L'AMOUR " Lad , I was flabbergasted . Here was this handsome young woman who should be settin ' at tea with some other young ladies , tellin ' me she had all those skins for sale . " Next thing I know is , I 'm makin ' a deal to sail to China . I warned her there was risk . She said she understood that . Nothing is gained without some risk , Captain . ' " We talked a bit and she asked questions , very sharp questions about markets , products , and shipping matters . I tell you , lad , there 's a shrewd woman ! " Jacob came in , chose a bunk , and then came over to the table . " Weather changing , " he commented . " We 're in for some rain , and we can use it . " He paused . " Cap , have you heard any talk about war with Mexico ? , Nobody out here knows anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a lot of hard feeling . " " I 've heard rumors . What 's the feeling here ? " Jacob chuckled . " These are good people , Cap . Goodnatured . They want no trouble with anybody , but right now they have closer ties with us than with Mexico . They want to be known as Californios and only that . Push ' em , and they 'll fight . . . there 's always cuttings and shootingsamong the rougher crowd in Sonora Town ... but mostly the people here just want to go their own way . If it comes to trouble with Mexico , I believe California would stay out of it unless some hothead starts trouble . If it becomes a matter of honor , the Californios will fight . " " Their trade is mostly with the States , " the captain commented , " and I hear complaints about governors appointedfrom Mexico who do n't understand conditions here . " " They want a California man for governor , " Jacob said , " and you ca n't blame them . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico City , and some of their rulingsdo n't make sense here . These are good people , . Let them alone and they 'll be all right . " " They wo n't be let alone , Jacob . You know that . It is too rich a country . Jedediah Smith showed the way across the desert and mountains . Ewing Young and his partyTHE LONESOME GODS 123got through also , and there have been others . They were just a beginning . " Far into the night they talked , often of things my father and mother had discussed . Everything about California , that mysterious place of menace , had fascinated me , yet finally I fell asleep , curled in my bunk . When I awakened , Jacob had already saddled the horses . " Sleep well ? There 's a place up on the trail where we 'll breakfast . " He stopped , one hand on the saddle . " They have hot chocolate . Figured you 'd like that for breakfast . " The captain , he went back to his ship last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's anchored about threequartersof a mile out . When the weather 's right , he can come right in over the bar , as he does n't draw more'n about nine feet . Someday folks will get busy and deepen that channel , and you 'll see ships in here , dozens of ' em . " Miss Nesselrode , she thinks this is going to be a big city . " " San Pedro ? " " Well , that or Los Angeles . Get aboard and we 'll get going . It 'll be nearly a day 's ride as it is , us stoppin ' to eat . " We rode our horses up the slanting trail from the shore . When we reached the top of the rise , we could see anothership beating in toward the bay . " Now , do n't you be talkin ' about Miss Nesselrode an ' all she does . First place , folks would think you were storyin ' , because she kind of keeps it quiet . Womenfolks are n't supposed to be into what she is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' there . Don Abel Stearns knows . He 's maybe the richest man around . Owns a lot of land . There 's a few others . . . men . " She 's canny . Nobody ever really sees her talkin ' business . Womenfolks would n't approve ; neither would most of the men . I do some of it , but mostly it is just a word or two on social occasions . " I'he captain , he 's been out to China and Japan twice now . Fie carries other goods , of course , but he does better124 LOUIS L'AMOURwith the furs he carries for Miss Nesselrode . Otter hides are much in demand there , for they are beautiful furs . " It was a canny thing , to begin with them , but a frightfulrisk , too . She could have lost it all , had the ship gone down . " There was a small patch of trees ahead , and off to the left a much larger bunch , a sort of a wild forest of scrub oak and sycamore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of mixed growth of brush and small trees , all entangled . The trail skirted wide around it . " Bears , " Jacob said . " California 's grizzly country , an ' a grizzly ai n't afraid of nothing . Tackle a man soon 's he would a rabbit , but they eat mostly roots , berries , leaves , and suchlike . They 'll feed off dead animals , sometimes make their own kills  --  it depends on the bear . Grizzlies is notional . " We rode over a slightly rolling plain covered with sparse brown grass and patches of brush or trees . Ahead of us there was a low adobe building , some corrals , and a lean-to shed . The roof of the adobe was of red tile . " See that tile ? Injuns made it . Taught by the folks at the missions . The missions are closed now , and the Injuns who made the tile have gone back to the hills , most of them . There 's no tile to be had nowadays . " " How big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred to two thousand . Varies some . A few years back , 1836 , I believe it was , they taken a census . Came to two thousand two hundred and twentyeightin the whole county , and more'n five hundred of them were tame Injuns . They figured there were forty-six foreigners , twenty-one of them considered to be Ameri-cans . " He turned his horse in through the gate and drew up at the hitching rail . " I do n't pay much mind to such things , but Miss Nesselrode , she wants to know everything . " Jacob dismounted . " Come along , Hannes . Out here folks eat breakfast at ten o'clock , usually , and what they call dinner at about three . Sometimes they eat supper , mostly they do n't . " I know these folks . Pablo wo n't he here , most likely . THE LONESOME GODS 125He works on the zanja . You know , the irrigation ditch that runs through town . Isabel . . . that 's his wife ... she 's a Mexican girl . Pablo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeds folks who come along and prob'ly makes as much as Pablo does . Maybe more . " It was cool and still in the stone-flagged room . There were three tables with benches beside them , and as we entered , a young woman came in . She was plump and quite pretty , with very large dark eyes . " Senor ! It is not often you come this way ! Would you be seated ? I have not much , but ... " She left the room , returning in a moment with hot chocolate and some tortillas . " Wait ! You like the quesadilla , senor , and you shall have it . " She paused , looking at me . " And you ? What would you like ? " " The same , " I said , embarrassed . It was not often that I talked to a woman . The hot chocolate was really hot and it tasted good . I had drunk chocolate but once before this and liked it very much . When she returned with the quesadillas , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He does "  --  Jacob gestured to me . " I have just met him at the ship . He will live in Los Angeles and go to school there . " " Ah ? You have family ? " I shook my head . " Miss Nesselrode was a friend of his family . She asked me to meet him and bring him to her . " " She is very pretty , Miss Nesselrode , " Isabel said . " I wonder that she is unmarried . " Among the Californios , who often married at fourteen , an unmarried woman of thirty was a puzzle . Yet I had not read romances for nothing . Between bites of quesadilla I said , " He died ... or was killed . I do not know . " Immediately she was all sympathy . Who understands a broken heart better than those of Spanish blood ? " Ah ! I see ! When she was very young ? " 126 LOUIS L'AMOUR " She was in love , " I said solemnly . " He was very handsome . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kitchen , Jacob glanced at me from the corners of his eyes and said very softly , " Now , I never knew that before . " " Neither did I , but she will tell the story and they will have an answer that pleases them . Now they will understand and ask no more questions . " He grunted . " For a youngster no older than you are  --  " " It is in many of the stories , and the Spanish are a romantic people . My father knew many of their songs , and so did my mother . They all seem to be of broken hearts and lost loves . I just said what is in the songs . " He chuckled . " Boy , you 're a caution ! You surely are ! " It was sundown when we came within sight of the town . It lay on a wide , undulating plain , and to the north there was a line of low hills ; on the east there were mountains . There was a river flowing near the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town itself the streets seemed to have no plan or system . The houses were mostly of adobe , flat-roofed and low , yet here and there was a larger frame house or an adobe of two stories . There was a government house and a church . Jacob Finney led the way through back streets to a pleasant house surrounded by a hedge of willows . The zanja ran close by . The house was of adobe with red tile on the roof . It seemed better built than many of the others . There was a corral behind the house , with several horses . " You go knock on the door , Hannes . Miss Nesselrode will be anxious to see you . I 'll put up the horses . " Hesitant , I stood in the yard , trying to straighten my clothes and brushing them with my hands . There was a low roof over the porch , and a bench with a rocking chair beside it . Slowly I walked up , and just as I lifted my hand to knock , the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stepped back , showing me in , and Miss Nesselrode came to greet me , both hands outstretched . " Johannes ! After all this time ! Please come in ! " THE LONESOME GODS 127She stepped back and looked at me . " My ! You 've grown ! And what a handsome boy ! " I blushed , shifting from one foot to the other . " How do you do , ma'am ? " I asked . " Sit down , Johannes . I can see we 're going to have to get acquainted all over again . " She smiled suddenly , beautifully , and I found myself grinning at her . " Tell me , now , what have you been doing ? What is it like , this place where you 've been living ? " So I told her , slowly at first , then with increased confidence , about Agua Caliente , the Indians , the store , the forests of palms in the canyons , and the house itself . " A hot spring ? Tell me about it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked many questions about the climate , the soil , what grew there , and who lived there . Later , I told her about my father 's murder and how I had been left in the desert . " I heard of that , " she said . " Johannes , we must be very , very careful ! Your grandfatheris a very influential man . He is also very wealthy . He does not mix with people here , and particularly not with the Anglos , but there is little he would not know if he wished . The advantage we have is that usually he does not wish . " He must not see you . You look very much like your father , only you are darker . The Spanish blood , I expect . " She stood up suddenly . " It is late , and you must rest . Tomorrow we must find a tutor for you . Until then I shall see what I can do . In the meanwhile , Hannes , is there anything you want ? " " Something to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when someone goes back to my house , I 'd like to send some books back there . " " But why , when you are living here ? " So I told her about the house of Tahquitz and the unseen visitor who exchanged books with me . She sat down , hands clasped before her , elbows on her knees . " What a strange story ! Just think of it ! A monster who reads Scott and Bulwer-Lytton ! " " I do not know that he is a monster . I do not know who128 LOUIS L'AMOURbuilt the house , or who comes to get the books , or even if it is the same . . . person . " " How long ago was the house built ? " " Only five or six years ago , I think , but there was another house there , or some sort of building . Part of the walls are very old . My father said very , very old . " " The Indians know nothing ? " " Who knows how much an Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows about anything . They are good people , most of them , but they think differentlythan we do . " " You 've learned a lot , Johannes . " " No , ma'am . I 've learned a little , but I know there is so much more . My father always said that was the wonderfulthing about learning , that there was no end to it . " The Mexican girl came in from the kitchen . " Senorita ? " " Yes ? " " There 's a man over there , hiding in the willows across the street . He watches the house . " " Thank you . " She glanced at me . " You are not afraid , are you ? " " No , ma'am . " She smiled at me . " You want to know something , Johannes ? I am not afraid , either . " 19Miss Nesselrode was slender and elegant . I never knew her to raise her voice or make a violent movement . Her dresses were simple , of gray or brown , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , she carried a parasol . She smiled often , but her smiles were of several kinds , and I learned to know them . Of who she was or what she had been , she never said , nor did she ever speak of her plans or what she expected of life . When she came to California she had a little money . Far less money than most believed , although how much that was , I never knew , and I believe I knew more than anyone . It was very little . She met people easily , and they liked her . In the times of trouble , she was always ready to help , and seemingly always knew what to do . Invariably she took charge , quietly , efficiently , and without seeming to be in charge . She had what my father would have called a wellorderedmind . I mean , it was uncluttered . She seemed to have an ability to isolate a problem and examine it withoutanything else intruding , and above all , she could make decisions . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probably what she was : at first she must always have gambled ; later , only on occasion . She seemed tall . Even when I grew to my full height , she seemed tall . Men always looked at her , at first with hardly concealed excitement , then with respect . I believe that in the first year she was proposed to two dozen times , and often by men of wealth and power , but of that1Q130 LOUIS L'AMOURI only heard through gossip or the talk of the girl who worked for her . She had at once hired a girl . Wages in California were very low , but she looked carefully at a number of girls before she asked one to work for her . In the meantime , she hired Jacob Finney . I believe she had spoken to him before the wagon arrived in Los Angeles , or at the Bella Union Hotel , where she stayed for the first few days . Jacob liked California and had commented once that he thought of settling there . Somebody asked him how he would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he would find something . She hired him for twenty-five dollars a month . It was as much as he would have earned as a cowhand in Texas , probably more than he expected . " What am I to do ? " he had asked . " Do as you please , but be there when I need you , and I will need you often . Above all , " she had added , " I want a man who does not talk . I want you to say nothing of what we are doing , but not to seem mysterious in any way . " First , she had him buy horses for herself and for him . Then she had him buy two cows for milking and some chickens for eggs . He planted some trees , tended some flowers , and he listened . At breakfast in the morning and occasionally in the evening , he told her what was happening in the City of the Angels and what people were talking about . She wanted the talk from the cantinas , from the saloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wanted most of all to know who was doing what when it came to buying , selling , or investing . She listened , and she visited . She attended fandangos , but rarely danced . She drank coffee with the women , listened to them talk . She watched the handsome young Californios ride into town in their magnificent suits , some of which cost severalthousand dollars , and often astride saddles worth as much or more . After her early moves buying up sea otter skins from trappers she continued to buy more . She bought bearskinsTHE LONESOME GODS 131and other furs . She bought hides . In none of this did she appear or seem to have a hand . It was always Jacob , althoughoften she sat a horse nearby and listened . They had signals by which they communicated , and when she felt the price was right , she bought . By the time I came from the desert , she had bought an old adobe to use as a warehouse . She had also managed to buy several acres of land on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange trees and grapes . On the second day I was there she had me read to her . When I had read for a time , we talked about the story . She had many questions , but it was mostly fun talk , about the people , their clothes , their horses . And for the next few days we talked a lot , about Ivanhoe , Robinson Crusoe , Robin Hood , things of which I had read or which I had learned from my father . She was , I know now , trying to judge my education , if it could be so called . " Do you remember Thomas Fraser ? " she said one day . " Yes , ma'am . He was the man who took notes when we came west . " " That 's the one . He is here in town , still working on his book , and he has started a small school . I thought we might send you there . Although he knows your true identityI believe it would be worth taking that risk since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , ma'am . " A thought came to me . " What happened to Mr. Fletcher ? " Her expression changed ever so slightly . " He is here . I see him occasionally on the street , but he goes to San Francisco quite often . " " I did n't like him . " " Nor did I. And I like him no better now . He is a gambler at least part of the time . Avoid him , Hannes . " Later , when we were alone , I asked Jacob about him . " Yeah , he 's around . He 's a bad one , boy , a real bad one . I ie 's become a sort of leader for a small group of thugs , but so far he 's done nothing anybody could catch him at . Jacob was currying a horse . Ile paused for a moment , 132 LOUIS L'AMOURboth hands resting on the horse . " Your grandpa does n't come to town too often . Only time he 's seen much is ridin ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaqueroswith him ... tough men . " Rides a black stallion , big , fine-lookin ' horse , and the old man can ride . Has to , if he handles that animal , and he does . Believe you me , he does . " Keep out of his sight . You look like your pa , but something like your mother , too , or so the Indians say . Ai n't likely he 'll see you . He pays no attention to anyone , seems like , but you never know . " Miss Nesselrode was interested in the desert , and she asked many questions about my life there and how I had lived . " You must remember not to speak of it , " she warned again . " Although the chances are the subject will never come up . To Angelenos the desert is far away , and most of them know nothing of it at all . Nor are they interested . " That is part of the trouble , " she added . " This is their world and sometimes they seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is another world and it is filled with acquisitive people . " When a Californio wants money , he wants it now , and he will pay for it . They do not seem to grasp the workings of compound interest , and they have always bartered for things and there has always been plenty of land , plenty of cattle . They are nice people , but they can not seem to understand there may come a time when it is all gone . " " Do you lend them money ? " " Yes , and I have warned them . They smile and thank me very pleasantly , but I am a woman and they are merely tolerating me . " They borrow money and the interest is compounded monthly . When the notes fall due , no effort is made to collect because they who lend money want the interest to continue . Finally the borrowers have to give up thousands of acres of land , to pay for comparatively small loans . " She paused . " Thomas Fraser will be your teacher . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , THE LONESOME GODS 133and you write well . Now you must learn to cipher , and you must learn something of geography . Our world today is growing small . At any time some faraway country may become important to you , to your country , and to your business . Above all , you must learn to be a good citizen , and that means you must learn how your government works and how to go about getting things done , either in government or business . " The one thing we know , Hannes , is that nothing remainsthe same . Things are forever changing , and one must understand the changes and change with them , or be lost by the way . " You have come into this world with good health and a good mind . The rest is up to you . " When I awakened the next morning , I did not get up at once , but lay abed thinking . My enemy was here , close by . A man had been watching our house .... Why ? Had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? When it came to that , who was she ? Why was she willing to take me in , send me to school , have me in her home ? Was it kindness ? Respect for my father , and pity for him and for me ? Or was it loneliness ? Or was there some other reason of which I did not know ? The reading of stories causes one to wonder about motives , but I could think of no reason why a small boy would be useful , but many ways in which he might be a trouble or at least an inconvenience . While dressing , I thought of school . I wanted to go to school , yet I did n't . I had known very few children of my own age , and none very long . Francisco had been the only one whom I could call a friend . We had moved often , and my few ventures into schoolrooms had not been pleasant . Other children taunted me . Said I spoke like an old man . Teachers were sometimes flattering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother had taught me many things , had read to me from books usually read only by older people . In some ways I knew much more than my teachers ; in others I knew less than any of the children . My teachers often realized how widely I had134 LOUIS L'AMOURread and were nervous because of it . I did not want it so . I wished only to learn , and to be friendly . " Today , " Miss Nesselrode said at breakfast , " we will buy some clothing for you . " " I have money , " I said . " How much ? " " One hundred and seven dollars . My father left it for me . " Keep it , Johannes , and say nothing about it to anyone . There are men in this town who would rob you for even one of those dollars . " She seemed to be considering , and then she said , " Perhapswe will invest a little of it for you , along with something of mine . It is never too soon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to get money , but few know how to keep it . Wise investments are always based on information , Johannes , so the more you know , the better . The women know much more of what is going on than their men realize , although most women are simply not interested . Sometimes when we are among ourselves , they talk of such things , and I can learn who is buying , who is selling , and what the city officials are about to do . " Often men talk to me , wishing to impress me with how much they are doing and how important their activitiesare . I listen , Johannes , and I remember . " When you are a man , remember to tell no one of what you are doing unless you wish it to be known . The woman you are telling it to may be relating it all to another man . She looked at me suddenly . " Johannes ? What do you wish to be ? What would you like to become ? " I did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried me . Should I know ? " There is time , " she said , " but the sooner you know , the sooner you can plan . To have a goal is the important thing , and to work toward it . Then , if you decide you wish to do something different , you will at least have been moving , you have been going somewhere , you will have been learning . THE LONESOME GODS 135 " What did your father do ? I mean , how did he make a living ? " I did not know . He had taught school for a while . I know for a time he had worked for a newspaper . We had moved often , for even in the East there had been attempts to kill him . Or he thought there were . Yet , I was puzzled . I told her what he had done , but there were other times when he had traded in horses , when he bought and sold things . " With what , I wonder ? Johannes , your father worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to have lived well , and you traveled . He paid for your trip west . Three hundred dollars for him , one hundred for you . It is quite a lot . Can you remember nothing else ? " She seemed to have an idea . " Was there no one he went to ? Or some place to which he returned from time to time ? " I could remember none . Of course , I had been very young , and of those years there were only memories of places and people here and there . From the years , I could recall only brief moments , none of which seemed important . Although Miss Nesselrode had said we were to buy clothingfor me , yet we went to no stores . She always took a walk each day , and on this day when she returned she told me a tailor would be coming to take my measurements . " You are tall , " she said , " and we must leave no clues , so we will lie a bit about your age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small lie and will turn away speculation if your grandfather should hear of you . " In any case , " she added , " there is no connection betweenyour father and me . " " Except the wagon , " I said . " Yes . . . " She paused , considering . " There is that . " 20The room was long and low , with two windows that looked across the zanja into an orchard . On the other side there was one window which looked toward an empty corral . Inside the room there were two tables and four benches . There was a smaller table at the far end , and a chair where Thomas Fraser sat . He arose when we entered the room . " Miss Nesselrode ? How good to see you again ! And Johannes  --  ? " " Vickery , " she said . " Johannes Vickery . I hope you will find him a good student . " " The classes are for four hours only . You understand , ma'am ? I have my own work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is understood . I believe you will find him eager to learn . You have how many students now ? " " Only five at the moment . Three young ladies and two young men . Johannes will be the sixth . " " Very well . Tomorrow , then ? " " Eight o'clock . . . here . " He followed us into the yard . He had always been thin . He was thinner now . " It has been good to see you , ma'am . It was an adventurewe shared , one that can not be forgotten . I would never have believed  --  " She smiled beautifully . " It is all very well , Mr. Fraser , but a time that is past . Teach Johannes what you can . None of us might be here were it not for his father . EachTHE LONESOME GODS 137time I see Mr. Farley , he assures me that is true . He says he never saw a man shoot so unerringly , so coolly . " " He is a good man , " she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , but if he is to make a living , he must do more than write . His book must sell , also . " " But surely the stores will do that ! " " No doubt they will carry a few copies of his book , as my store will do , but why should they be bought ? What is to make somebody come to that store and buy his book , of all that are available ? He must give them a reason . He must somehow excite their interest , and then the book must hold that interest . " We walked along the street , sometimes on walks made of boards but more often of hard-packed earth or even of sand . Here and there flat rocks had been placed to make the walking easier when there was mud . The bookstore was a small place wedged between a general store and a saddle shop , and the books on the shelves were few . There were newspapers and magazines , and she always had coffee on the stove . " We will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered long since . " She removed her hat and placed it beside her parasol . " You can help me here , Johannes . Look about and see what we have . " " You sell books ? " " Of course , but this is also a reading room . Men come to read the newspapers , to talk business and politics . One can learn a great deal that is useful just by listening . " It is also a place where people can meet me , although , as you will see , Mr. Finney does most of my business for me . " She smiled suddenly , her eyes filled with mischief . " After all , what would a mere woman know about business and politics ? A wise woman in these days will listen in wide-eyed innocence , Johannes , ask a discreet question or two , but refrain from comment . " " You should n't tell me this , " I protested , grinning at her . " I shall someday be a man , and I will know what you do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Johannes . In the meantime , listen , learn , and say nothing . Remember , no138 LOUIS L'AMOUR I THE LONESOME GODS 139matter what you do or what you become , you will also have to do business . It is the way of the world , Johannes , so learn what you can now . " Later she commented , " In the course of a week , every man of importance will come in . At first it was the Anglosand Europeans , now the Californios come as well . " " And my grandfather ? " " He does not read . He can , but he does not . There are many who assume that once they have become men there is nothing to be learned from books . " Standing by the door , I could watch people passing in the street : a pescadero , selling fish from the sea ; a vaqueroin a buckskin suit and broad sombrero , riding a dun-colored horse ; a Mexican woman selling panocha , the dark Mexican sugar candy of which I had heard from Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed too small for the task . At sundown we closed the shop and walked home through streets rapidly growing empty as people went to their homes . One man paused , removed his sombrero with a broad silver band , and told Miss Nesselrode of a fandango that was being arranged , and would she come ? When we had gone on , she said , " That was Senor Lugo . He is of an old family here , with much land . He knows your grandfather . " " They are friends ? " " No , I do not believe so . Your grandfather does not seem to make friends , nor care to . He is known , respected , and sometimes feared , but he does not make friends . " " He came from Spain . " " So it is said . You would know more of that than I. " " My mother said he came from Spain long ago , when she was a very small girl . He was given land by the king . He was a very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder why he chose to come to California ? He does not seem the type for adventure , and if he had a strong position in Spain , why would he give it all up to come here , to this outpost ? " My father and mother had talked of this , and they had also been puzzled . " Was your mother the only child ? " " I do not know . Sometimes I think ... No , I do not remember . " Yet I did remember something . . . something . . . What ? Now that the question had arisen , I tried to discover a reason why a man of wealth and position would abandon it all and come here . California was delightful , but far from the centers of power . Where had I heard that ? My father , I guessed . My mother had talked much of her family , and I could see in her much of the fierce pride the old hidalgos had , pride of family , pride of name , and of person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride was founded upon events of long ago , or just upon the family 's continued existence . Once , seated in the wagon , I asked my father how such families came to be . What had they done ? " Very often , " he said , " he who founded the family would not be received in any of their homes now . The founder was often a peasant , a poor soldier or sailor , an adventurerwith a strong arm and a sword who carved his way to wealth and position . " Usually he was a man of strength , courage , and acquisitiveinstincts who rode in the entourage of a king or great lord and was given estates as a reward for services in the field or court . " There were few cities then , and everything centered around the castle . Each lord in time of war was expected to furnish so many fighting men . Shoes , clothing , everythingnecessary was made by craftsmen at the castle . The only way for a young man to escape from being a serf was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win a name for yourself . There were no shops then , or craftsmenoutside the castle , and if you did not own land , your only chance of success was that sword I spoke of . " If you did not belong to a castle , you were a landless man , which meant you belonged nowhere , were fair game for anyone , and almost an outlaw . " Some such men became wandering traders . Later some settled down to practice their trade or craft , and towns140 LOUIS L'AMOURcame into being . That 's roughly the way it began , in Europe , at least . " Another day , when the newspaper readers had gone , we closed the shop and I walked home beside Miss Nesselrode . " It is a very small town , " she said to me when we paused to let a girl driving goats pass before us , " but it will not remain small . " " How can you be sure ? " " It has the sea close by , it has many thousands of cattle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will surely become a great city . " Above all , " she said as we crossed the street , " it has men like Don Benito Wilson , William Wolfskill , the Workmans , and others . They are forward-looking men . " Do not forget , Johannes . It is men who make a town , and bigger men who make a city . " " I have known one , " I said , " and you met him , too . Peg-Leg Smith . " She smiled . " You know , Johannes , he was an old scoundrel , I think , but I did like him . " " He liked you , too , " I said , and told her about his finding me in the desert . " During the next few years , Johannes , you should be thinking about your future . What do you want to be ? What do you want to become ? " To succeed as a human being is not always the same as succeeding in your life 's work , although they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or almost alone , but that can make you stronger , for you will not be inclined to lean on anyone . You have enemies , but that can be an advantage . Enemiescan be an incentive to survive and become someone in spite of them . Enemies can keep you alert and aware . " We ate a small supper , quite late . " You read a great deal , Johannes , so you can be a help to me in the store . " " I 'd like to help . " " Good ! We will think about that . In the meanwhile , tomorrow you begin school . " The room in which I slept was small , with a narrow bed and two windows . There was a chest in which toTHE LONESOME GODS 141keep clothing , a table , a washbasin , and a pitcher with water . On the floor were two rag rugs . The walls were bare , of plastered and whitewashed adobe . Lying in bed that night , I worried . At no time had school been pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning . Wherever I 'd gone to school , I 'd come in after all the others were settled in and knew each other . I 'd come along late and would know nobody and frequentlyI was one of the youngest in the school . They knew about the same things and the same people . They could talk about them . I did n't know any of those things , and none of the people , and I 'd lived in different places and mostly I 'd talked with older folks or been talked to by them . Usually a strange boy in school was teased . Often he had to fight , and twice I got licked . Once we fought until we were both tired out and it was kind of even up , although I had a bloody nose when it was over . I got blood on my clothes and I had n't any others . Each time a day was over , I was glad to go home . I said nothing to my parents , and except the time when I was bloody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa took me out back and tried to show me something about fighting . He did n't show me much , but it helped . " Most boys in schools , " Papa said , " hit for the face . Keep your hands up , and when you can , hit ' em in the belly . " Later he said , " These are rough boys . If they push or shove you , do n't talk , do n't call names , do n't argue . Hit them first , and hard . " I did , and it worked . It worked on that same boy who gave me the bloody nose . He shoved me and I swung a backhanded blow and hit him in the belly , knocking his wind out . Before he could fall , I hit him in the face . That day he had the bloody nose . Now I had it to do again . There were two boys , and I could be sure one of them would think he was something big . Miss Nesselrode , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L'AMOURNowhere in Los Angeles was far from anywhere else in those days . The school was only about three or four minutes ' walk from Miss Nesselrode 's , and it was a little before eight o'clock when I showed up . Two boys and two girls were sitting on benches outside , but not together . They all looked up when I came into the yard , but nobody said anything . One of the boys was bigger than me , both taller and heavier , and he was older , too , I thought . " What do you want here ? " he demanded aggressively . " I am going to school . " " Supposin ' I said I would n't let you ? " This was the beginning of trouble which I did not want , but one does not avoid trouble by backing away from it , not in all cases . I walked toward him . He had not expected that , and it bothered him a little . " Mr. Fraser knows me . He expects me this morning . " " 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He runs thingsin the schoolroom . I run ' em in the yard . " I said nothing , I simply waited . My heart was pounding heavily . Big as he was , I did not think he was any stronger than some of the Indian boys with whom I had wrestled . " Who are you , anyway ? I never saw you before . " " I have just come from the sea . I came around the Horn in a Boston ship . " The other boy was fascinated . " Around the Horn ? Gee ! " " My name , " I said , " is Johannes Vickery . " " That ai n't so much , " the big boy said . " Anybody can come around the Horn . " " Of course . But I did it . " I was lying . I had not come around the Horn , but there was need to establish my story . Miss Nesselrode had told me that , and so had Jacob Finney . At that moment Thomas Fraser turned into the yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see you have met Rad Huber . And this "  --  he indicated the smaller boy  --  " is Philo Burns . " The young ladies , " he said , " are Della Court and Kelda O'Brien . " He glanced around . " Where is Meghan ? " THE LONESOME GODS 143 " She 's coming . " It was the girl called Della who answered . " She was expecting her father to come in . " Fraser glanced at me . " Her father is Captain Laurel , of the Queen Bess , " he explained . We went inside and took seats at the table . The others had seats occupied before I arrived , and I waited until they were seated , then sat down . " That 's where Meghan sits , " Rad said belligerently . " I 'm sorry , " I said , and moved over one space . " You go sit at the other table , " Rad ordered . " Where he 's sitting will be quite all right , " Fraser said , and Rad shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , muttering . " This morning , " Fraser said , " we will continue with the study of inflection and emphasis in the spoken language . " That was how my school days began. 21For three days I attended school , and each day the seat beside me was empty . On the fourth day , Rad Huber stopped me in the yard as I approached the school . He stood squarely in front of me , feet spread apart . Philo Burns stood at one side , but the girls had not yet come to school . Or I did not see them . " Meghan 's coming back to school today , " Rad said . " You move to that other table . " " Mr. Fraser told me where to sit . I shall stay there . " " Meghan 's my girl ! You move or I 'll move you ! " " I do not know Meghan , " I said , " but I shall stay whereI am . " He struck me . I was not expecting it , and he knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when I put my hand to my mouth , there was blood on it . Angry , I started up , and he hit me again before I got to my feet , knocking me down again . Rolling over , I tried to get up , and he kicked me in the ribs . Time and time again I tried to rise ; each time , he kicked me or knocked me down . Stunned , bleeding , and hurt , I kept trying . I did not know why I kept trying , but something inside me drove me to it . One of the girls was crying . " Rad ! You leave him alone ! " " Come on , Rad ! Leave him be ! " Philo demanded . " Shut up ! " Rad said rudely . " He thinks he 's smart ! I'llshow him ! " Again I started up , and when I was on my hands and THE LONESOME GODS 145knees , he kicked me in the ribs . I gasped painfully , but struggled to get up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much ! Just a big baby ! " He backed off and turned away , and I struggled up , then rushed at him , swinging both fists . Somebody yelled , and Rad turned . One of my flailing fists caught him in the mouth , cutting his lip , but then he pushed me away and rushed at me , swinging both fists . He was larger , and had longer arms . He hit me again and again . Suddenly Mr. Fraser was there . " Here , here ! What 's going on ? Rad , stop that ! Leave him alone ! " " Hah ! He had it coming ! " He walked away . Slowly , painfully , I got up and tried to brush off my clothes . Thomas Fraser came over to me . " Are you hurt ? " he asked . " No , " I lied . " Wash your face , then , and come to school . " There was a washbasin on a shelf around the corner from the schoolroom door . I washed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the towel . I felt sore and stiff . Limping , I went into the school . Rad turned , sneering at me . Walking over , I sat down in my usual place . Rad started up , but Mr. Fraser said , " Rad ! Sit down ! " " You tell him to move , or I 'll move him ! " " I shall do no such thing . If there is any more of this , I 'll dismiss you from school . " " Hah ! " Rad said . " You 'll do no such thing . Pa paid for the term , and you try dismissing me . Pa would be down here to see you . He 'd be down mighty quick ! " Meanwhile , I opened my books , getting out my slate . Mr. Fraser looked at me but said nothing . His face was pale and he was angry . Perhaps he was frightened , too . His existence depended on the school , and I suspected he had n't the money to return to Rad 's father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsided . He opened his books ; 146 LOUIS L'AMOURthen he whispered , " You wait until school 's out ! You just wait ! " Something fell from my lips to the slate . It was a drop of blood . I wiped it off , staring bitterly at the place where it had fallen . What was I to do ? He would beat me and kick me again when school was out . Nobody would stop him . Still dazed , I hung my head over my slate and felt like crying , but I did not cry . I would not give him the satisfaction . Somehow , I would .. . He could hit very hard . He would hit me again and again . He would kick me . " Hit them in the stomach , " my father had advised , but Rad 's arms were too long . I knew so little about fistfighting , but I had wrestled with the Indian boys . I could throw them all , except Francisco , and once in a while I could throw him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of William Tell , I almost did not hear him . Then I stood up and read . Slowly , because of my swollen lips , but I read well . " Very good , Johannes , " Mr. Fraser said . " Hah ! " Rad sneered . Seated again , I scarcely listened to what was happening . I was thinking , thinking hard , and I was scared . I did n't want to be hit again . I did not want to take a beating and have them all seeing me lying in the dust . I had to do something . One thing I knew . I was not going to move . I did not know Meghan . I did not care to know Meghan , but I was not going to move . He could kill me , but I would stay right where I was . Yet , what could I do ? Something ... My father used to say there was always a way . There was an answer to everything . If I could only .. . Maybe .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside again . Thomas Fraser might protect me here , but away from the school he could do nothing . There was movement at the door , and I looked up . THE LONESOME GODS 147She stood just inside , the sunlight touching her hair . It was red-gold . She was slender , graceful as a willow , and beautiful . This was Meghan . . . and I was in love. 22She paused for a moment in the doorway , the sunlighton her red-gold hair . Then she crossed the room and sat down beside me . Automatically I arose , stepping back for her . She gave me a quick smile and I trembled . She seated herself and I sat down beside her . The edge of her dress brushed my trouser leg . " Miss Laurel , " Fraser said , " our new student , Mr. Vickery , has just read a part of William Tell . You might read the conclusion , up as far as the shooting of the apple . " She read easily , beautifully , in a low , well-modulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes remained riveted to the lines , although scarcely seeing them . I was conscious of a faint perfume , fresh , flowerlike . When I did look up , Rad was glaring at me , and I felt myself go sick and empty . He would attack me again , as he had threatened . He would beat me , and I would go down in the dust again , as before . Only now it would be different . She would be there . She would see it . She would think me contemptible . In fear and agony I waited for the class to be over . Jacob Finney was coming by for me with my horse . We were riding out to the tar pits along the old Indian trail . As I started to rise , I turned toward Meghan and she gasped . " Oh , your poor face ! What happened ? " " It was a fight . I think there will be another now . " " Rad ! It was Rad , was n't it ? " gnuTHE LONESOME GODS 149 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ! Picking on someone smaller than himself ! " " He 's not so big . " We had started toward the door , but as I stepped back to allow her to go through the door ahead of me , a hand grasped my shoulder and I was shoved aside . Rad stepped into my place and moved up beside her . Now I was angry . Out in the yard he started walking away beside her . He had brushed me aside as if I were nothing . Inside me there was cold fury . I fought it down . " What 's the matter ? " I called after him . " Are you scared ? " He stopped abruptly and turned around . They all did , even Mr. Fraser , who stopped in the doorway as he started back inside . " Scared ? Scared of you ? " He put down his books and started toward me . Now you 're in for it , I told myself . Do n't let him hit you . Wrestle ! He was larger in every way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? He had his fists up ready to strike , and mine were up too ; then suddenly I dove , graspinghis ankle with both hands and throwing my weight against his knee as I jerked up on the ankle . He toppled over on his back . Instantly , holding his ankle in my right armpit , I stepped across his body , half-turning him toward the ground . Then I dropped to a sitting position on his buttocks , facing the opposite way . The Indians had taught me this , and I knew I had only to put more pressure on his ankle and his hip would be dislocated . I leaned back a little , and he cried out . Fraser had turned and was coming toward us . Out on the street Jacob Finney had come up with my horse and his . He sat his saddle , watching . Meghan stood with the other girls , their faces showing excitement and shock . " Let him up ! " Mr. Fraser ordered. 150 LOUIS L'AMOUR " Ask him first if he will let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will you let him alone , Rad ? " Fraser asked . " I 'll kill him ! " I leaned back again , and this time he screamed . Then he said , " No ! No ! Get off me ! I wo n't do nothin ' ! " Letting go , I got up . Rad lay still for a moment , then got up painfully . Wary , I backed off . " Now , that 's quite enough ! " Fraser spoke sharply . " We 'll have no more of this ! Any more trouble between you , and I shall dismiss you both , do you understand ? " " I never wanted trouble , " I said . Rad glowered but said nothing . Meghan glanced at me , then turned her back and walked away with the other girls , Della and Kelda . Turning to Mr. Fraser , I said , " I am sorry , sir . I wanted no trouble . " When I reached my horse , Jacob looked at my face . " Looks like you taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier . His arms are too long . " " You done all right , seemed to me . Where 'd you learn that fancy stuff ? " " From the Indian boys . They wrestle all the time . " " Feller downtown . Man I know . He 's pretty good with his mitts . He 's boxed in New Orleans , New York , an ' London . We got to get you with him . You fight that boy again an ' he may n't let you get hold of him . Not if he 's smart . He 'll just stand off an ' punch your lights out . " We rode in silence for a few minutes and then he said , " This place we 're goin ' . They call it the tar pits . Comes right up out of the ground . The water has oil in it , too , seems like . An ' gas . It bubbles right up through the water , the bubble floats a minute or two , then busts . Animals get stuck in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ones that get trapped . " Folks hereabout , Injuns , Californios an ' such , they use the tar on their roofs . Use it to watertight their boats , too . The Chumash Injuns who live along the coast , they used it first . THE LONESOME GODS 151 " The Chumash make mighty fine boats . Some carry eight to ten people , maybe more . They use tar along the seams to make the boats watertight . " They used to go out to the islands off the coast , to Catalina , Santa Barbara , an ' the like . The Chumash were right handy with boats , but they 're gettin ' fewer and fewer all the time . " He pointed off to his left . " Off down there 's a big cienaga . Sort of swamplike . The river used to run down there and just spread out . Then about fifteen years ago she broke through to the sea an ' drained most of that . Still mighty good grazing land . Green grass and some water down there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their roundups down thataway . " This trail runs all the way to the sea . There 's a bay along there , Santa Monica Bay . Not much protection , though , in bad weather . She 's too open . " Miss Nesselrode , she wants you to know the country around , and the folks . " " What 's off there ? " I pointed toward the mountains . " There 's the mountains , and over beyond , a wide valley . The pass they call the Little Door . The Injun name is Cahuenga . " There 's trails through most of the canyons . Just horse trails , mostly , but there are bears back in there , lots of them , and more than likely they wo n't get out of the way , in which case you 'd better turn around and get out of there , ' less you want to fight . " " I heard there were bandits . " " Oh , sure ! Plenty of those . Some just steal horses , some raid lonely stations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful . " The day was warm and pleasant . All around us was a wide sweep of grassland dotted with clumps of oak and other brush , with here and there a small grove or a patch where someone was planting . Scattered everywhere , although not in great numbers , there were cattle . " Once in a while a man has to fight , " Jacob said , " but152 LOUIS L'AMOURyou avoid it if you can . Fightin ' attracts attention , and that 's the last thing you need . " This is a small town with not much to talk about . Fortunately the Californios do n't pay a lot of attention to us Anglos . There 's a few of us here , and although Stearns and a few others are doing well , they go about their business without blowing up a storm . " The old don keeps to himself , mostly . They say he thinks himself better than the others because he is of pure Castilian blood . Your grandmother has been dead for a good many years , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister , the Dona Elena . " She runs a mighty fine house , or so they say . Stoneflaggedfloors ' n everything . I suspect there are n't more'n a half-dozen houses in town with anything but dirt floors . Out here folks make do with mighty little . Nothin ' fancy to be had . " Back t ' home my ma never had much to do with , but we lived better than these folks who have thousands of acres . The government does n't permit trade with anybodybut themselves , although there 's a good deal of business done with the Boston ships . " " You mean , they 're not supposed to ? " " They got laws against it , but what 're these folks to do ? They are needful of things , and the ships come in . Usually those who are supposed to enforce the laws look the other way . " Jacob Finney drew up . " Back yonder , that 's Rancho Las Cienagas . I told you about the swampland . Francisco Avila owns that , and off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranch is called Rodeo de las Aguas . Means the gathering of the waters , ' likely because of the springs . A widow woman owns that . Her husband was a soldier named Valdez . " La Brea , where we 're headed , that 's owned by a Portugee named Rocha . Good man . I helped his folks catch up some horses here a while back . Injuns had started to run them off an ' we had a bit of a set-to . " One of these times , you an ' me , we 'll take ourselves anTHE LONESOME GODS 153outfit and ride off up the San Joaquin Valley . That 's over yonder . A long , long valley with herds of wild horses everywhere , two , three hundred in a bunch . Some fine stock , too . " " They belong to no one ? " " That 's right . Wild as antelope or elk . Comes to that , I 've seen herds of over a thousand elk . Boy , that 's one you 've got to see ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Californios do n't hunt much . They have all the beef they want and they make do with that . Me , I like elk meat . It 's right tasty . " We rode on , lazy in the sunshine . Cattle moved out of our way or turned their heads to look at us with a total lack of interest . We were not chasing them , and they knew it . " There ! " Finney pointed . " See ? The trees yonder ? That dark pool ? That 's it . You got to ride careful , there 's severalsmaller patches of tar here an ' there . " He waved a hand . " Most anyplace here you can push a stick into the ground and it will come up black with tar . " The Chumash been coming here for centuries to get tar to calk their boats . " See ? The bones yonder ? Something trapped there , buzzards fed off it , and maybe one of them trapped , too . If you set still and watch , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yonder ? It bubbles up , the bubbles break , and after a bit , another one comes . " Water is n't fit to drink . Too much oil an ' stuff , but this here 's somethin ' to see . A few years ago a ship 's captain from down to San Pedro , he come out here to get tar and he found a tusk . Elephant 's tusk . " Anybody 'd told me , I 'd not have believed it , but there i t was . " " The Indians have stories about hunting them , " I said . " Not the Cahuillas , the Plains Indians . " " You do n't say ? That 's one I never heard . " " It was the Osage , I think , " I said . " It was a hairy elephant they had killed . " We left our horses cropping the grass and walked over to the pools , but not going too close . The trees Jacob had154 LOUIS L'AMOURmentioned were actually some distance away , but grass grew right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The larger pool was at least an acre in extent . " It was larger when we were here the first time , " Jacob said , " but this has been a dry year . " He pointed out two more pools , each no larger than a washtub , and several places where grayish bulges of tar or asphalt had pushed up through the grass . " There are several oil springs around , " Jacob said . " Miss Nesselrode wanted to see them , so we rode over to take a look . Injuns and some of the Californios come there to get oil for some treatments they give themselves . " " It is a strange place , " I said . " I 'd like to come back again . " " Reckon you can do about as you wish when there 's no school . You talk about that with Miss Nesselrode . I do n't know what she has in mind , but you can bet she 's figurin ' on something . That woman 's mind never sets still , believe me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , " Jacob agreed , " but let me warn you , althoughyou are n't likely to need it . Do n't cross her . She 's almighty pleasant . She 's a fine-looking young woman with a lovely smile and all that , but there 's cuttin ' steel under it , and do n't you be forgettin ' it . " We mounted up and started back , and Jacob said , " She wants you to ride around over this valley and get acquainted with the locality . Do n't ask me why . Maybe she just wants to be sure you do n't get lost sometime . Knowin ' her , I 'd lay a good bit she 's got something else in mind . " We were unsaddling our horses when he spoke again . " Did you learn to speak any of that Cahuilla lingo ? I mean , could you make them understand ? " " Most of them spoke some Spanish . Francisco and his father know both Spanish and English . They know enough to get along , anyway . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different language , I think . " THE LONESOME GODS 155 " She wants you to learn it , Johannes . She 's got something in mind . " We started for the house , and Miss Nesselrode was standing in the door , waiting for me . I knew right away that something had happened . Something was wrong. 23Miss Nesselrode rested a hand upon my shoulder , but she spoke to Jacob . " Will you come in , Mr. Finney ? This is something you should know . " Her hand caressed the back of my head . " Johannes ? You have a visitor . A guest . " It was dusk and the candles had been lighted . Somethingin her tone seemed to warn me . In my right hand I held my rifle and pistol belt , for I had been told never to ride without them . " You will not need those , Johannes . Come in , now . " She stepped aside to permit me to pass , then closed the door behind us . It was a moment not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the two candelabra , the old carved chest against the wall , the table , the chairs , the rag rugs upon the floor , and that tall , straight woman standing there , looking at me . Her hair was black , but white at the temples . She had allowed her rebozo to fall back to her shoulders . Her features were thin and what people called aristocratic . She was a beautiful and stately woman , no longer young , but a woman with presence , to whom years had brought added beauty . She had distinction , more than anyone I had known , perhaps more than anyone I would ever know . " Yes "  --  her voice was low , very pleasant  --  " of course ! How like them you are ! " She stepped forward , holding out a hand . " Johannes , I am your great-aunt , Elena . I have looked forward to this moment . " 156THE LONESOME GODS 157Great-aunt ? My mother spoke fondly of her Aunt Elena , but if she was my grandfather 's sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem like an enemy . Her smile made me want to draw closer . " I am Johannes . . . " I hesitated , then added , " Johannes Verne . " " I know . " She seated herself , yet even in that simple movement there was something regal . " May we talk a little , Johannes ? " She glanced at Miss Nesselrode . " You have been most kind . I have but little time . If he should call for me . . . at night I am almost never away . " " Of course . " Jacob came in quietly and took a seat on the far side of the room . " Please , Johannes , tell me of your mother . " My mother ? What could I say ? What could I tell her ? Why should I tell her ? " I loved her very much , Johannes . She was like my own daughter . And I liked your father . Had it been up to me ... " She was beautiful , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we were always together . She was very happy , I believe , except when she thought about home . She told me many stories of Spain , and stories of the sea voyage to California , and of the landing . " My father offered to take her back to California , but she was afraid for him . " " He was always a bold one . I think he feared nothing . Tell me . . . where did you live ? How did you live ? I want to know everything . " " We moved often . My father had gone to sea with his father , who was a ship 's captain , as you would know , and he had planned to become one himself . Yet he could not return to the sea without leaving us , and he would not do that . " For a time he managed a livery stable in Philadelphia , and later he trained horses and managed a big farm in Kentucky . He was a marshal in a Missouri river town before that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby then , I guess. 158 LOUIS L'AMOUR " Often he said he would like to find a permanent job so he could write . Mr. Longfellow , the poet , was also a professor , and Oliver Wendell Holmes was a physician . Mr. Emerson , I think , was a minister . Each had some way of living so he could write with freedom . " Many of the people who came to our house in Philadelphiawere writers , like Mr. Lippard , who had long straggly hair and wore strange clothes . He lived in a big old ramshackle house of many rooms where all sorts of people lived . The house had been abandoned , I think , and they just moved in . " There was a Mr. Hirst , whom I saw only once or twice , and there was the editor , Edgar Poe . I think he was a writer , too . " Yes , I know he was because I remember Papa wonderingwhat he might have written had everyone not wanted stories of ghosts , haunted houses , and tombs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " Papa read me the stories of Rip Van Winkle , ' and about the ' Headless Horseman , ' and sometimes when Papa 's friends came around , Mama made coffee or tea for them . Mr. Poe liked to hear Papa talk about his years at sea when he was a boy , and he asked many questions . On one voyage Papa 's ship was blown far to the south when rounding Cape Horn , and they found themselves among icebergs and had a terrible time before they escaped . " Mama told stories , too , and one of them was about Boabdil , the Moor , who was sleeping in an enchanted cave with all his knights , awaiting the moment when he would awaken them to reconquer Spain . " " She sat with the men ? She talked with them ? " " It is not the custom . But they all insisted she be with them , for she knew so many stories . Some of them , I think , were stories you told her , for I remember she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late and they forgot I was not in bed , or maybe Mama just made believe she forgot , for she would say suddenly , Oh , how awful ! You should be in bed , young man ! ' But if the stories were very good , she would make believe to forget again . THE LONESOME GODS 159 " There was one story that made her sad . It was a story about a monster  --  " " A monster ? " " A woman named Mary Shelley wrote the story . Her husband was a poet , I think . It was a story about a student named Frankenstein who made a man out of pieces of dead people . People thought the creature a monster , but he was n't really . Mama always felt sorry for the monster . I thought he 'd be kind of scary . " For a moment there was silence in the room , and then Aunt Elena changed the subject . " You lived in Kentucky , you said ? " " A man who met Papa at the livery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He liked the way Papa cared for the horses , and he said all the trainers he wanted were already employed and if Papa could produce a winninghorse he would give him a share of the winnings . " " Did he never talk of going to sea again ? " " Oh , no ! By that time Mama was sick and Papa wanted to get out of the city where the air was better . Once when we were alone he said we must be very good to Mama because she was more ill than she believed . Papa would not take any kind of work where he could not look in upon Mama often . " Once I heard him talk to Mr. Poe about it , for his wife was ill also . Both of them had consumption , and it was considered a kind of aristocratic illness , whatever that is . People became pale and frail and all the doctors did was prescribe fine wines and special foods . " Papa said to Mama that he had no right to keep her where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be well . We must go back . ' But Mama would not go . She said Papa would be killed . " He said , ' Do you think I would die so easily ? ' " ' No , ' she said , ' but you might kill him , and that would be just as bad . ' " Sometimes at night when they thought I was asleep they talked of me , worrying about what would become of me when they were gone , because by that time Papa was sick , too , and Mama knew it . After Mama died  --  "
