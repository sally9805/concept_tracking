DINNER AT THE HOMESICK RESTAURANT by Anne Tyler Knopf : 303 pages ; $13.50 <P> Every other year or so since 1964 , loyal readers pick up their new Anne Tyler novel as they would buy a favored brand of sensible shoe . Each of her nine books is solidly constructed from authentic and durable materials . Yet traditional style and comfort do not necessarily mean dullness . Tyler 's characters have character : quirks , odd angles of vision , colorful mean streaks and harmonic longings . They usually live in ordinary settings , like Baltimore , the author 's current home , and do not seem to have been overly influenced by the 7 o'clock news . An issue in a Tyler novel is likely to mean a new child ; a cause , the reason behind a malfunction in an appliance or a marriage . <P> Tyler does not trivialize motives with rationalizations . She launches her imagined lives and describes their trajectories with an unpretentious sense of fate . No explanations are necessary when Beck Tull , a retired traveling salesman , attends the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts as if he has been on a long business trip . This occurs at the end of Homesick Restaurant , and the reader is not surprised . The scene has had careful preparation , and Tull has been well defined by his absence . He is the black hole around which his wife Pearl and children Cody . Jenny and Ezra have had to exist . The novel opens with Pearl Tull , 85 , dying and remembering . It then turns effortlessly into a series of chapters about her children that can almost be read as self-contained stories . <P> The family anger takes different forms . Pearl becomes a compulsive handyman . " All she wanted was to be allowed to get on with what mattered : calk the windows ; weatherstrip the door . With tools she was her true self , capable and strong . " Son Cody finds his outlet as a time-and-motion consultant . The richer he grows weeding out waste and inefficiency around the country , the clearer it becomes that time and motion are all he truly possesses . Daughter Jenny is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runny noses , diaper rashes and colic . There seems to be no line between her own assorted brood and her patients . <P> Ezra is the dreamer who nurtures the novel 's most enduring illusion . He runs a restaurant as if his soups and stews could cure loneliness and disappointment . The permutations of food and woe inspire him : " Why not a restaurant full of refrigerators , where people came and chose the food they wanted ? . . . Or maybe he could install a giant fireplace , with a whole steer turning slowly on a spit . You 'd slice what you liked onto your plate and sit around in armchairs eating and talking with the guests at large . Then again , maybe he would start serving only street food . Of course ! He 'd cook what people felt homesick for . " <P> Ezra 's homesick restaurant is not very profitable . It does manage to survive on its owner 's terms , which , if one reads Tyler correctly , are worth more than the print-outs of an efficiency expert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolishness and steals his fiance . She is a scrawny country girl who unhappily ends up in expensive boxy suits and fancy automobiles . But Ezra is not deterred . A would-be wife turned sister-in-law is still family , and a family should eat together .
