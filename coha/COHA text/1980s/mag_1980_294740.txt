Help for homely cons <P> " I 've always been ugly , " said a Florida prisoner serving a life sentence for murder in a letter to Surgeon Edwin Joy . ' That , added to some psychological problems , made me antisocial . I wanted to socialize , but who wants an ugly guy around ? " ' His hope : surgery that would help the convict , 31 , improve his self-image and perhaps reform him . <P> The operation , which Joy intends to do , would not be the first performed on a prisoner ; at least 40 inmates in the South have sought a new outlook on life from Joy , head of the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery at the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta . Joy 's mentor , Surgeon Elmer Bear of the Medical College of Virginia , began reshaping prisoners ' mugs 20 years ago , and has done about 25 such operations all told . <P> What has sparked renewed interest in these procedures is growing evidence that they can indeed alter behavior . Originally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a misaligned Dick Tracy jaw , for example , or the treatment of constant drooling by a deformed inmate who could not close his mouth . But as Bear and Joy told a conference of their colleagues in San Francisco , these operations often pay dividends for society . Joy points with pride to a once unpopular prisoner at Virginia State Penitentiary , an antisocial murderer who , after surgery to correct a grossly protruding jaw , finally won the friendship of fellow inmates . <P> Joy does not promise to turn a felon into a bank president . In any case , a more informed judgment on facial surgery 's potential for changing personality probably must await release of a study now under way at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine . Meantime , prisoners continue to apply for surgical work that may cost taxpayers $2,000 to $4,000 . But even at that , it may be the cheapest rehabilitation program going .
