txt TED ICENNEDY 'S humiliating defeat ? 61 the Iowa precinct caucuses adds j aOsiernother deist to Jane Byme 's already crown . ! Not only Is she a louayor , she is a bum judge of presidentiasy l c mandidates and a worse judge of how the public can spot political phonies . In this instance , Iowa voters rejected Kennedy by a resounding 2 to 1 margin . They rejected a candidate as unfit for Offloe , not an incumbent . In Jane Byrne 's case last spring , the t reverse worked . Chicago voters rejected an incumbent , $ , former Mayor Bilandic . And they elected Jane Byrne , not because she was the best choice , but the only other choice in a strictly Demobratic town . Bilandic was voted out of office . Ken ' . Indy was rejected . But Mayor Byrne ; ' continua to cling to the illusion that *people voted her into office and , , there-tore , she can do no wrong . ' I WELL , JANE BYRNE Is wrong . She also is wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office . The j snow did . , And so now , as Chicago voters begin to = ye their mistake , their wisdom is by Iowa voters who were sharp al enough not to be fooled by the media- 2. inspired charisma of the gutless senator j from Massachusetts . 1 Kennedy 's charisma , if ever it existed , washed off in the waters of Chappaquiddick . And Jaoe Byrne 's charisma , if ever it existed , vanished in the maelstrom of 1 1 political vengeance and inattention to duty with which she has enveloped Chicago since her April election . i And if Jane Byrne is the ultimate politielan she seems to perceive herself . ? iell qtdckly back off from this floundering , playboy and start addressing herself in- : stead to the responsibilities to which she I ' was elected . i In retrospect , Mayor Byrne premature ; iy tied her political fortunes to Kennedy , obviously in the hope of riding his coatj tails to national prominence . She enjoyed her moment in the sun  --  and in the weekly news magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i However , now that her favorite has ! been found wanting by public opinion , and in a contest with an incumbent Presi : dent whose fortunes are not all that hot either , perhaps Jane Byrne should start . reexamining her own priorities . For her one venture as a political kingi maker is starting to look like a bomb . j ? ID recent weeks , two reports  --  one in ? Reader 's Digest and the other in the Washington Star  --  have raised fresh questions about whether Kennedy told the truth about his actions following the death of Mary Jo Kopechne in a 1969 automobile accident on Chappaquiddick Island . Both reports have challenged Kennedy 's version of swimming across tide-tortured waters between Chappaquiddick and Edgartown after the ace ' . dent . And both have produced technical testimony casting doubt on Kennedy 's accounts of the swim . However , neither article has addressed the real issue about Kennedy 's conduct that raises serious questions abopt his competence or character to lead a one-man band much less the United States of America . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  failed to notify police that a helpless woman had plunged into six feet of water in an automobile driven by him and might still be fighting for her life while trapped in a bubble of air . For many hours  --  five of them spent in a hotel room sack  --  Kennedy did absolutely nothing to mount an official rescue effort in the hope of saving Mary Jo Kopechne 's life . For many hours , Sen. Edward M. Kennedy , the politician presumptious enough to want to lead the United States into the noes , kept his cowardly mouth shut . For many hours , in fact until about 8:30 o'clock the next morning , Kennedy did not notify police . And when he finally did , it was only after flit calling his Washington staff for help . Obviously , Iowa voters were smart enough to determine that Ted Kennedy can not be trusted to act responsibly in a time of crisis , personal or otherwise . So they sent him a message to get lost . And it is a message Jane Byrne should take to heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue her erratic course toward political oblivion , For Chicago voters , . despite their momentary lapse after the blizzards of 1979 , also are smart enough to figure out that if Ted Kennedy is Jane Byrne 's ideal of a national leader , then her own shortcomings no longer are a mystery . Jane Byrne has criticized Jimmy Carter for sweeping issues under the carpet . Ted Kennedy swept a young woman under six feet of water and was stupid enough to think he could keep it quiet . The choice may not be the greatest in the Illinois Democratic primary March 18 . But it should be perfectly clear , even to Jane Byrne.
