In a major story this week on Washington 's newest growth industry , TIME describes the phenomenal rise in numbers and clout of the capital 's lobbyists and influence peddlers . " It is a revolving door for those who are willing to hawk the connections and access they gained while in office , " says Senior Editor Walter Isaacson , who supervised the story . " With tax reform , trade policies and the budget now facing Congress , the effect of influence peddling could become a major political issue . " <P> The chief reporter for the story was White House Correspondent David Beckwith , who has examined Washington influence peddling before . In 1978 , as a staff writer in New York City , he wrote a cover story on the power of lawyers , including those in the nation 's capital . Observes Beckwith : " Washington lawyers were the hot item of that day , when they helped businessmen thread the mazes of Government regulation . Today an influence seeker needs someone to help him fight for a piece of a shrinking federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them . " <P> Despite the apparently pervasive power of Washington 's corps of influence peddlers , Beckwith believes that their interests do not always prevail . " On major issues , " he says , " the weight of public opinion , fear of public exposure and the moral fiber of elected representatives seem to ensure that the public interest is recognized  --  and served . " Beckwith concludes that " the best and brightest lobbyists know how to come up with good political reasons for a legislator to advocate their private client 's interests . " <P> Associate Editor Evan Thomas , who wrote the story , is no stranger to the intricacies of doing business in Washington . As a Capitol Hill reporter from 1981 to 1983 , Thomas covered the burgeoning growth of political-action committees and their effect on campaign fund raising and other activities for a TIME cover story that ran in 1982 . Thomas returned to Washington recently and , with Beckwith as his guide , made a kind of Cook 's tour of the new influence peddlers , visiting the offices of top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congresswoman Lindy Boggs ; Anne Wexler , former aide to President Jimmy Carter ; and ex-White House Majordomo Michael Deaver . The experience , says Thomas , provided him with an updated view of Washington  --  and gave a special immediacy to this week 's story .
