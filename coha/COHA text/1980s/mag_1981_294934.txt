RAY <P> by Barry Hannah <P> Knopf ; 113 pages ; $7.95 <P> The hero of this deft assemblage is a doctor who practices in Tuscaloosa , Ala . What he practices , chiefly , is high-spirited swinishness . Ray dispenses morphine and other controlled substances to patients who are his friends ; he also lends his friendly nurse to some of them . On the other hand , he pulls the plug on a cranky old man who annoys him . Unsteadily launched on his second marriage , Ray fools around with a succession of compliant women , while visions of high-heeled nudes out of Penthouse dance in his head . He looks back longingly to his days as a fighter pilot in Viet Nam : " The only glory I see is the glory I saw as a jet fighter . " Ray is , in short , an extremely bad good ole boy . <P> Author Barry Hannah , 38 , is also a connoisseur of the rundown , the tacky , the disreputable . Observes one wastrel : " My pappy 's from Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . " Pretty much the same thing can be said about Ray himself . Hannah is talented enough to make his hero 's uninhibited meanness sympathetic and humorous . Ray says things that most people only think , at low moments : " I get tired of people . All of them driving around in their cars , eating , having to be . " But unrelieved rascality can grow boring , and this short novel ends not a page too soon . <P> - P.G.
