By land , sea and air , expelled aliens head for home and harder times <P> On the cab of a battered and overloaded Toyota van waiting at the border between Nigeria and neighboring Benin was the unintentionally ironic sign NO CONDITION IS PERMANENT . The statement was all too true for the score of Ghanaians packed inside , and for as many as 800,000 of their countrymen who had suddenly been ordered to leave Nigeria . By truck , boat and plane , they streamed out of the country last week , carrying what possessions they could . Many of them were hungry and sick . All of them were hurrying to meet the Feb. 1 deadline for their expulsion . Along the way , at least 34 participants in the chaotic exodus died of starvation , in accidents or from other hardships . <P> The unwanted aliens had come to Nigeria over the past five years to take jobs created by the country 's oil boom . But Nigeria 's economic bubble has been punctured by the recent decline in world oil prices . On Jan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the alien workers , most of them illegal entrants to black Africa 's most populous state ( 85 million ) , had two weeks to leave the country .

By the time the first ship arrived , more than 30,000 people were waiting on the quays . In the scramble to get aboard , several plunged into the harbor ; at least one drowned . " It was crazy , " said a Nigerian port official . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard job controlling the crowd . " Those who missed the first ship camped out amid gathering piles of garbage , grateful for the harmattan , a breeze of Saharan dust that blotted out the sun and kept temperatures down from the usual 90 F. Women nursed babies in the shadow of cargo sheds , while vendors of fruit , bread and illegally distilled local spirits set their wares out in the open . <P> Most of the expelled workers chose to make the 275-mile trip to Accra overland and their journey was often a nightmare . Separated from Nigeria by the narrow countries of Togo and Benin ( see map ) , Ghana is ruled by Flight Lieut . Jerry Rawlings , who seized power for the second time 13 months ago . Rawlings had ordered all his borders with neighboring countries to be closed last September in an effort to wipe out smuggling and assuage his own fears about an external coup plot said to involve foreign mercenaries .
