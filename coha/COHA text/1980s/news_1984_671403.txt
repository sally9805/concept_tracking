The defendant , Lieut . Leszek Pekala , said he had been told that the mission had official approval , even if the abduction were to result in the death of the priest , the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko. // The trial is believed to mark the first time that a Communist country has publicly prosecuted members of the security police for the slaying of a dissident . The death of Father Popieluszko , on Oct. 19 , jolted the Government as no other event since the rise of the Solidarity labor movement in 1980 . <> <> Shift in Government Attitude // The Government first sought to convince the nation that it wanted to uncover all those who were behind the killing . Recently official spokesmen have sought to soothe the police establishment with assertions that the four accused were exceptions. // As the first witness , Lieutenant Pekala , a slight , 32-year-old man , described in a faint voice how , at the request of his commanding officer , he and two of the other defendants discussed plans to dispose of the priest by pushing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car crash. // He said that the intent was to frighten the priest into giving up his political work , but that he had been told there was a possibility the victim might die . <> <> Intent to Kill Is Denied // " I want to say that I admit having taken part in all the acts mentioned in the indictment , " Lieutenant Pekala said in answering questions from one of the seven judges after the indictment had been read . " But I do not admit that I had the intention of killing anyone. " // Polish law makes no distinction between premeditated and unpremeditated murder , and Lieutenant Pekala and the two others accused of murder - Capt . Grzegorz Piotrowski , 33 , and Lieut . Waldemar Chmielewski , 29 - face possible execution . The fourth defendent , Col. Adam Pietruszka , who is charged with abetting , faces a long prison term if convicted. // Government officials have said the first three have made confessions. // Mr. Pekala spoke from the prisoners ' box , separated from his co-defendants by police guards . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a helicopter circled. // While Lieutenant Pekala testified , Captain Piotrowski , described as the chief plotter , stared glassy-eyed , offering occasional small smiles and wiping his face with his hands . Lieutenant Chmielewski sat impassively while a nervous tic kept turning the corner of his mouth . Colonel Pietruszka , the oldest of the four , scrunched down between police guards. // In the front row of the spectators ' seats were Father Popieluszko ' s younger brothers , Jozef and Stanislaw , both wearing photos of the priest on their lapels . Next to them sat Waldemar Chrostowski , the priest ' s bodyguard and driver , who had managed to escape from the abductors . The alarm he gave set in motion a manhunt that led to the discovery of the priest ' s body in a reservoir on the Vistula River and to the arrest of the four officers. <> <> 30 Reporters Covering Trial // // Others in the audience included relatives of the defendants and 30 reporters , including five foreigners . Several foreign news organizations were represented by Polish staff members . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send an American . The Ministry of Justice said the main criterion for selection was ability to understand the Polish-language proceedings. // The most striking parts of Lieutenant Pekala ' s testimony related to the workings of the Interior Ministry , to which he was attached. // Under questioning by one of the judges , he described how he was summoned by Captain Piotrowski in early October and was asked whether he was willing to take on " a dangerous mission . " He said he had replied , " In principle , yes , " but wanted to know more about it. // He said he and Lieutenant Chmielewski learned about the assignment later in the day . Lieutenant Pekala said Captain Piotrowski had told them the mission had the agreement of his superiors " even if it involved the priest ' s loss of health or loss of life . " <> <> No Other Superiors Identified // When Lieutenant Pekala was asked whether any superiors were identified , he mentioned only Colonel Pietruszka. // According to the testimony , the captain gave the two men a week to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off under the guise of sick leave , and Lieutenant Pekala for purported personal business. // The two examined a hut in the woods that one of them knew from his scouting days while Mr. Pekala inspected a bridge , saying he thought it might be a suitable place to threaten the priest with drowning . At one point they loaded boulders wrapped in two sacks into the car trunk. // The men also acquired flashlights , a clothesline , sticks , a bottle of vodka and rags to be used in the operation. // When a judge asked why these things were needed if the intent was only to frighten the priest , Lieutenant Pekala replied : " Captain Piotrowski told us there was a possibility that the priest would die . I agreed with this . " <> <> Brick Thrown on the Road // On Oct. 12 , in their first attempt , the three officers followed Father Popieluszko on a car trip to Gdansk , planning to move against the priest on his way back to Warsaw. // According to Lieutenant Pekala , the officers passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Piotrowski , his face hidden in a skicap , took up a position on the highway and prepared to throw a brick at the windshield of the oncoming car in the hope of forcing it into an accident. // " We thought maybe we could burn it , " the witness said. // The brick was thrown but missed its target. // In the audience , Mr. Chrostowski , the priest ' s driver , was asked by a reporter whether he recalled seeing a masked man throwing a brick on the road . He said , " Yes , but we did not make anything of it. " // As Lieutenant Pekala was testifying , his voice faltered several times . Artur Kujawa , the presiding judge , asked whether he was tired . The officer said he was , and the trial was adjourned. // //
