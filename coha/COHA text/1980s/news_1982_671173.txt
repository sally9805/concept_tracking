The storm closed the airport entirely for nearly two days , stranding thousands of holiday travelers , some of whom were still here awaiting flights. // As of today , airport crews had reopened two runways and most airlines were operating barely a third of their normal flight schedules. // Meanwhile , the National Weather Service was predicting up to five inches of new snow in eastern Colorado by Tuesday morning . Forecasters said the new storm , accompanied by high winds and colder temperatures , was almost certain to wreak havoc with highways already clogged with snow . As of 9 P.M. there had been 4 more inches of snow in some parts of the Denver area , and even more on the eastern plains near the Kansas and Nebraska border . <> <> Interstate Highway Closed // By midafternoon today , a combination of snow and freezing rain had forced the Colorado State Patrol to close Interstate 70 between Limon and the Colorado-Nebraska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The Weather Service issued an advisory that travel anywhere in eastern Colorado could be dangerous .
