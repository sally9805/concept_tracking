South Africa 's Parliament is officially segregated into three houses  --  one for whites , one for so-called coloreds , one for Asians , and none at all for the country 's black majority . When State President P.W . Botha opened this year 's session in Cape Town last week , he addressed the members of all three houses in a new $16 million , 340-seat assembly hall . But the new auditorium may not get much use . <P> After Botha finished his speech , a 35-minute droner devoted almost entirely to the economy , the briefly integrated assemblage filed out to reconvene as usual in three separate chambers . And though the government has proposed that joint sessions be held periodically , the colored House of Representatives and its leader , the Rev. Allan Hendrickse , have rejected the proposal as a cosmetic half step . The dispute is only the latest confrontation between Botha and Hendrickse , 60 , a portly , goateed former Congregational minister . Says Hendrickse : " P.W . Botha is the sort of person who does not give in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been flowing since early last year , when Hendrickse sauntered into the surf at a whites-only beach as a demonstration against apartheid . Hendrickse , whose Labor Party holds 76 of the colored House 's 85 seats , opposes Botha 's key political legislation this year , including several amendments to the Group Areas Act , which chops South Africa into segregated areas . <P> Botha and his National Party , which controls 133 of the 166 elected seats in the all-white House of Assembly , could pass these measures anyway . Botha , however , can not prevent Hendrickse from blocking another proposal  --  the postponement of elections from 1989 to 1992 . Shocked by the strong showing of the far-right Conservative Party in last year 's balloting and alarmed that his party might lose control of the government , Botha wants to delay next year 's vote . But the deferral must be approved by all three houses . Hendrickse says he will pass the measure only if Botha will agree to repeal , not just amend , the Group Areas Act . As Hendrickse told Botha , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making radical changes , the Labor Party will have no other option than to send you back to the voting polls in 1989 . " <P> A former high school teacher who was detained for two months in 1976 for political activism , Hendrickse became chairman of the House of Representatives ministers ' council in September 1984 , which earned him a seat in Botha 's Cabinet . When Botha learned last August that Hendrickse intended to block the postponement , he warned him that he could not do so and remain in the Cabinet . Hendrickse resigned . He is convinced that Botha is trying to split the Labor Party and replace him with a more pliant leader . Says he : " Carrots have been dangled . " <P> If Hendrickse retains control and keeps saying no to Botha , Parliament will be dissolved in September 1989 . Hendrickse is confident that Labor will fare well at the polls . " Our stance has enhanced our position in the colored community , " he says . " We are no longer seen as collaborators with the system . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repeal the Group Areas Act . Hendrickse 's opinion of the prospects for reform this year : " Bleak . "
