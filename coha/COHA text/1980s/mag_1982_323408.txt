For the stricken star of Tootsie , due out later this year , making the film has been a complete drag . " His breasts fall down . The high heels hurt his feet . The makeup causes pimples , and the heat makes his beard show through after a couple of hours , " says sympathetic Director Sydney Pollack . The breast-fallen lady he is referring to is that model of middle-aged primness , Dustin Hoffman , 44 . In Tootsie , the actor renowned for his demanding perfectionism plays an actor so renowned for his demanding perfectionism that he finally has to go into distaff disguise to get a part . Tales of Hoffman 's adventures in the role abound . At Manhattan 's Russian Tea Room on a lunch break , Hoffman-still in costume and makeup-stopped by the table of an old friend , Public Relations Man John Springer . Dustin introduced himself as Dorothy Michaels , an aspiring post-ingnue from Kansas City . Says Springer , who did not twig to the put-on : " I knew there was something fascinating about the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> It is good to see old friends back together again . First Paul McCartney , 39 , worked on three songs for Stop &; Smell the Roses , the recent album of fellow ex-Beatle Ringo Starr , 41 . Then Paul decided that what the package needed was a brief video musical to go with the tunes . With Ringo 's wife Barbara Bach , 35 , and Linda McCartney , 39 , he and Ringo made The Cooler , an eleven-minute featurette set in a futuristic prison policed entirely by women . Cooler stars Starr as a habitual escapee , with McCartney hamming his way through three roles , including one with dyed blond hair .

That sum is well above the $240,000 that the Herald says is going annually to the third-highest-paid coach , Texas A &M's; Jackie Sherrill , 38 , whose six-year deal last January kicked up such a dust storm of criticism . <P>           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
