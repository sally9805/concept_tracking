Stephen King packs pop images into scary bestsellers <P> Horror has been frightfully good to Author Stephen King . He expects to earn about $2 million this year , mostly as a result of making people 's flesh crawl . The number of his books in print ( predominantly paperbacks ) climbs toward 40 million . Indeed , his pot currently boileth over . Creepshow , an original King screenplay directed by George Romero ( Night of the Living Dead ) , will be released in October ; a $6.95 comicbook version of the script has just been published by New American Library as part of the promotional hoopla . An adaptation of Firestarter , the sixth of King 's seven novels , is being filmed in Michigan , where local residents have eagerly offered to sell their homes for use in the movie 's incendiary conclusion . And King 's tenth book in eight years , with a hard-cover 200,000 first printing , began topping bestseller lists weeks before its official publication date . <P> Those who have already rushed out to buy Different Seasons ( Viking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocked by what they have brought home : a collection of four novellas , only one of which offers the chills that have become King 's trademark .

Gone are varieties of telekinesis ( Carrie , Firestarter ) and precognition ( The Shining , The Dead Zone ) . There are no vampires ( ' Salem 's Lot ) , apocalyptic plagues ( The Stand ) or satanically rabid Saint Bernards ( Cujo ) . The only reader likely to find these long tales truly frightening is an old-fashioned book lover : they are spooky examples of what can be called postliterate prose . <P> The genre is new , its methods still in the formative stage , but King is its popular master . Different Seasons offers a dazzling display of how writing can appeal to people who do not ordinarily like to read . King uses language the same way the baseball fan seated behind the home-team dugout uses placards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . In Apt Pupil , for example , a 13-year-old boy tracks down a Nazi war criminal hiding out in his own Southern California suburb . When he confronts the fugitive , the youth is disappointed by the old man 's accent : " It did n't sound . . . well , authentic . Colonel Klink on Hogan 's Heroes sounded more like a Nazi than Dussander did . " Perhaps a teen-ager might find a TV sitcom more vividly real than a phenome non that predated his birth . But members of his immediate family are judged in the same way : " Dick Bowden , Todd 's father , looked remarkably like a movie and TV actor named Lloyd Bochner . " When Todd finds himself in a dilemma , he mentally goes to the movies : " He thought of a cartoon character with an anvil suspended over its head . " <P>
