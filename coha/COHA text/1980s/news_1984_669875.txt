The Hershey name , synonymous with chocolate , is turning up on more and more products that contain less and less chocolate . Buffeted in the mid-1970s by sharp jumps in the price of cocoa beans  --  the most important and most expensive raw material in chocolate  --  Hershey Foods Corp. started to diversify . On one hand , it reached beyond its traditional candy business to purchase the Friendly Ice Cream restaurant chain and two macaroni companies . Last year , the non-candy businesses  --  including the San Georgio-Skinner unit , the nation ' s second largest pasta maker  --  contributed 32% of Hershey ' s $1. 7 billion in sales and almost 20% of its operating profit . But at the same time , Hershey has been expanding its candy business , adding new products that contain significantly less chocolate . While lessening the company ' s dependence on chocolate , the most expensive ingredient in candy , the new snacks also add some needed variety to Hershey ' s line of products : Company officials believe that people rarely buy the same candy bar twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is get on your menu , " says John H. Dowd , vice president for new business development in Hershey ' s confectionary division . " We can ' t sit here in Hershey ( Pa. ) inhaling chocolate and determine what Americans want . " In the past year , Hershey has introduced a line of four granola bars , only one of which contains chocolate . It has also started selling a chocolate-covered butter toffee bar and a wafer bar layered with peanut butter cream , and thinly covered with chocolate . Hershey ' s diversification coincides with a shift in consumer tastes away from its traditional , predominantly chocolate candies  --  the solid bar Milton Hershey started making in 1905 , for example , and Mr. Goodbar , a chocolate bar with peanuts . In 1963 , those predominantly chocolate products accounted for 80% of the candy division ' s sales ; last year , the figure was down to 46% . America ' s candy eaters  --  once lovers of solid milk chocolate  --  now seem to prefer snacks that combine chocolate , nuts and wafers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texture , " says James F. Echeandia , a candy industry consultant in Orlando , Fla . And more consumers appear to be concerned about the nutritional value of the snacks they eat . Moreover , consultants in the candy industry say that Hershey was forced to move aggressively into new products to keep up with Mars Inc. , of Hackettstown , N.J. Mars makes six of the nation ' s 10 top-selling candy bars , including Snickers , a chocolate-covered combination of peanuts , caramel and peanut butter nougat . Snickers has been in first place for more than 10 years . Hershey makes four of the top 10 candies : Reese ' s Peanut Butter Cups in third place , Kit Kat in fifth , Hershey ' s Almond in seventh and its original milk chocolate bar in 10th , according to a national sales survey by Distributor Concepts Inc. of Ann Arbor , Mich . Mars is making some aggressive moves of its own . It has started a campaign to expand sales by trying to convince consumers that candy is an acceptable snack food , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars paid about $5 million to sponsor this year ' s summer and winter Olympic games , and is promoting Snickers and M &; products as the " official snack foods " of the Olympics . Hershey is also courting health-conscious consumers , but with a product containing little or no chocolate  --  New Trail granola bars . Introduced nationally in late 1983 after almost two years in test markets , New Trail bars have already captured a sizable chunk of the rapidly expanding granola market . Hershey added a chocolate chip version this spring , and other flavors are in the works . Hershey officials , who promote New Trail as a snack , initially feared that a strong link with the Hershey name would make consumers think of the bars as candy . But the product has been so successful that Hershey plans to move its name  --  now in small print on the back of the package  --  to a prominent spot on the front . New product introductions don ' t always go smoothly . Hershey ' s Whatchamacallit , a chocolate-covered crisped rice bar , initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation ' s top sellers . Then it started to slip , recently falling to 30th place , according to Distributor Concepts . Now Hershey is trying out a new product  --  Take Five , a chocolate-covered wafer bar that is available in the West and Midwest . The product is aimed at adults , who , according to consultants , generally prefer a low-calorie snack that doesn ' t cling to the teeth .
