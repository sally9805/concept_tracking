PAPHOS , Cyprus  --  Neal Keny opens his staff meeting with an unusual greeting : " It ' s good to see you all  --  alive . " The 34-year-old Mideast regional director of Save the Children , a charity based in Westport , Conn. , is meeting with his Lebanese staff for the first time in 14 months . Even in what passes for normal times in Lebanon , such a meeting is difficult . Mr. Keny requires State Department permission to visit the country , which is off-limits to most U.S. citizens . To get there , he must take the American Embassy helicopter to avoid kidnap-prone Beirut Airport , and agree to be accompanied at all times by a U.S.-assigned bodyguard . Since March , however , when a shelling duel broke out between the Lebanese army in East Beirut and Syrian-backed forces in the West , conditions have deteriorated so much that even if Mr. Keny went to Beirut , his Lebanese staff wouldn ' t be able to get together to meet with him . A rarity in faction-torn Lebanon , the nonsectarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shiite Moslems from the southern suburbs , Christians from the East and Druse Moslems from the Shouf mountains . The diverse staff cooperates on projects that range from a vast program to supply food to about a third of the Lebanese population to a recent cleanup of six weeks ' fetid garbage that collected in West Beirut when municipal services ceased . These days , however , the shelling has closed roads and raised tension , making it difficult for people of different faiths to cross into each other ' s enclaves . " I used to go easily to West Beirut , " says Joseph Aoun , who runs the Save the Children office in the Christian port of Jounieh . But because his family name is the same as that of the Lebanese army commander , Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun , the risk is too high . " I could go , " he quips , " but I mightn ' t get back . " To sit down together , the dozen senior staffers now must leave the country and travel to the nearby Mediterranean island of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beirut airport is open , the trip takes 20 minutes . Now , West Beirut travelers must make a 17-hour journey via Syria , while easterners must brave the shelling to take the ferry . As staffers begin briefing Mr. Keny , the reason for his opening greeting becomes clear . A Christian who manages the organization ' s small loans to impoverished farmers or small-business people tells how her house was destroyed by three rockets . The family , huddled on the first floor , miraculously escaped injury . George Sliheet , a Palestinian-Christian who is the organization ' s finance chief , hands around pictures of his West Beirut office , its walls caved in by a shell . Most of the rubble landed on his desk ; fortunately , he was out of the office at the time . Serpouhy Alexandrian , an Armenian Christian , lived just 100 yards from the fuel-storage facility in Dora that exploded . The area had been evacuated , but hundreds of homes were destroyed or damaged . Amal Karaki , a West Beirut Shiite , fled with her family to South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left thousands of families crowded in with relatives , living in abandoned buildings , caves , or even parking lots , packed 100 families to a floor without power , water or adequate sanitation . " Maybe the car park is under a movie theater , so everyone uses the toilets there , " says Mr. Aoun , who set up distribution of blankets and other emergency supplies . He is now trying to get educational games to the children , whose schools have been closed since March . Staffers agree that the artillery duel is particularly hard on the children . Adults , confined day after day in shelters , can read or chat ; children can ' t run for lack of space or play noisily because of the elderly with whom they often share space . One staffer ' s daughter developed a worrying rash . " I was afraid she ' d got a disease from all the people crowded in the shelter , " the staffer says . Finding a doctor was difficult , because of the risks of venturing outside and because many doctors have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child diagnosed a stress-induced skin disorder and prescribed tranquilizers to be taken during shelling . The child is four years old . For adults , putting in a normal working day has become all but impossible . The first floor of Save the Children ' s main office is sandbagged , cutting out daylight . That ' s a particular hardship as power is on only about two hours a day . Working in the gloom is made even more difficult by an artillery emplacement 100 yards away . When the guns fire , concentration is out of the question . The country ' s already-shattered economy now has ground to a halt . While city-dwellers go hungry , farmers ' produce rots because it can ' t get to market through the roadblocks . A kilo ( 2. 2 pounds ) of cherries sells for 1 , 000 Lebanese pounds in East Beirut , 100 pounds in the West , and is thrown out in the orchards because of surplus . The West is without bread , the East without fuel . In East Beirut , Save the Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency supplies . When a rare opportunity to buy gas occurs , motorists queue for days to buy $2 worth . One of the few thriving businesses is the supply of sandbags . When the organization repacks bulk food into ration packs , the empty sacks , worth about 31 cents , fetch $2 each . The siege forces Marwan Sidani , the organization ' s director in Lebanon , to go all the way to Damascus , the Syrian capital , for permission to move a shipment of donated rice into East Beirut . Hiam Shadid , the West Beirut-based manager of the 3 , 400 American-sponsored children in Lebanon , had to get Syrian and Lebanese army permission just to deliver a gift of track suits to children in the East . Everyone looks glum as Mr. Keny reports on his recent consultations in Washington . State Department officials , he says , are " at a real loss " about what to do in Lebanon . The new administration doesn ' t want to " get sucked in and bogged down , " he says . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak with one voice " the U.S. will be reluctant to take an active role . The outlook for donations also is bleak . " Unless there ' s a move to political reform and reconciliation , donors aren ' t inclined to give lots of money , " he says . " It ' s not a panic situation yet , " he adds , but the view that it ' s impossible to do anything positive in the country is hard to overcome .
