" No matter whether th ' constitution follows th ' flag or not , th ' supreme coort follows th ' iliction returns . " <P>  --  Mr. Dooley <P> Not this time . Neither the flag nor the returns . " That flag decision , " allowed political analyst Horace Busby , " shows that old Mr. Dooley ( ( Finley Peter Dunne 's fictional Chicago bartender ) ) sometimes did n't know what he was talking about . This Supreme Court must not even read the newspapers . " Busby plans to monitor the July 4th festivities across the nation . If the flag burners come out in force , there could be quite a political ruckus and possibly a constitutional amendment in less time than it takes to sing The Star-Spangled Banner . <P> On the morning after the court had , with great heaving and sighing , delivered the flag decision , George Bush hit the Oval Office about 7:l5 . He did not even want to hear about the state of the world from his CIA briefer until he had dealt with flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he probably saw the flag in the Yellow Room or maybe the one in the Blue Room . Maybe he glanced down toward the Mall and spied the 50 flags at the base of the Washington Monument . If he missed all those flags , there was one right behind his desk in the Oval Office . <P> Bush called flag burning reprehensible . He vowed that he would say so publicly later in the day . Where he left off , his senior staff picked up . " Seems to me , " said one aide , " any virtue if carried to an extreme becomes a vice . No right is absolute if it is outweighed by damage to that society . " <P> There is nothing hokey about Bush 's indignation . He has carried his reverence for the symbols of freedom on his sleeve as long as he has been in politics and used them a time or two for political advantage . Back in the presidential primary campaign of l988 , Bush 's field surveys showed that the controversy over requiring the Pledge of Allegiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly favored in many audiences . His visit to a New Jersey flag factory during the campaign drew some boos from the political commentators , but Bush never blushed . <P> Handling the flag at that level of power is tricky . Lyndon Johnson quite literally ground his teeth when he looked out his White House window and saw the Viet Nam protesters desecrate flags . But he was a prisoner of jingoism gone sour . Richard Nixon used the Stars and Stripes as a weapon against the marchers , ordering extraordinary displays of flags , pointedly wearing a flag lapel pin . <P> Air Force One pilot Colonel Ralph Albertazzie had a better idea . When traveling abroad with the President , he was moved by the sight of people weeping when the plane taxied up . But he often flew and landed at night , and the long , graceful fuselage was swallowed by the dark . Albertazzie had small spotlights installed in the plane 's horizontal stabilizers to illuminate the flag painted on its towering rudder . Wherever and whenever the President flies , the flag glows ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That , in a way , is the history of the flag . It is not going to change , whatever the court may say .
