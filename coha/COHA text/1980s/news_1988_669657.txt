That horizon may be as many as five years down the road , but the fact that it ' s visible at all is heartening , after a decade of uncertainty about Brazil , whose $300 billion gross domestic product puts it among the top 10 economies in the capitalist world. // Gloom has long been part of the scenery . Since the end of a miraculous boom in the 1970s , the country hasn ' t seen the long-term 6 to 7 percent annual economic growth it needs to keep pace with a 1. 5 million yearly increase in the labor force , and to distribute income better. // // Triple-digit inflation , a problem throughout the 1980s , now threatens to hit a record 600 percent this year. // The uncertainty has by no means disappeared . Brazil ' s first direct presidential elections in 29 years will take place next year , and no one can predict the result . But a number of events in the last six months have provided new hope that Brazil won ' t , as some cynics have long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future. ' ' // ' ' Over the next five years , we are going to have a fairly tough situation , ' ' says the president of a major North American multinational corporation ' s Brazilian subsidiary . ' ' You have a democracy in its infancy and it has to mature . . . . It has tremendous potential . In three to five years , the economy will come back and Brazil will be a factor in the world market. ' ' // For this executive and many others , the most important good news is a new industrial policy announced late last month . With incentives for imported goods and technology , and for local research and development , the policy is meant to stimulate productivity and increase Brazil ' s industrial competitiveness . It also reduces the government ' s role in the economy , by privatizing some of the hundreds of publicly owned companies and by cutting regulatory powers. // For three decades , Brazil was one of the world ' s most closed economies , as it supported local manufacturing over imports . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only hope that President Jose Sarney will be able to keep it out of the bottom drawers of government bureaucracy. // They also hope he won ' t let the policy get buried by Brazil ' s Congress , which has put some nationalistic provisions against foreign business in the country ' s new constitution , now being concluded. // ' ' The executive is taking a leadership position , ' ' says Christopher Lund , president of the US Chamber of Commerce , in Sao Paulo . ' ' The industrial policy is an excellent initiative . It ' s very , very well thought out. ' ' // Mr. Lund and others believe the government will in fact gradually follow this and other policies to get the economy growing , simply because of a growing consensus that there ' s now no other choice . They add that Mr. Sarney ' s five-year term , voted him recently as part of the new constitution , gives him an additional 21 months to get the foundation for growth into place. // The other good news , businessmen say , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right moves to straighten out the country ' s debt situation and cut back on government spending to control inflation . The ministers , who came to office only this year , ' ' are having surprising success ' ' with their policies , says Jose Mindlin , president of Metal Leve , the No. 2 auto parts manufacturer and a big exporter to the United States. // ' ' They are competent , have no political ambitions , apparently , and they seem to have an economic plan to put things in order , ' ' he adds . ' ' With support from the executive branch , the possibility of a favorable solution is much better ( than before ) . ' ' // The plan differs from previous , failed attempts during the Sarney administration , by three different finance ministers . Usually , Brazilians must anxiously await new economic policy in the form of a mystery pacote , or package of measures . But the current ministers have avoided using the word pacote , have announced measures piecemeal , and have made a point of using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the support of businessmen and politicians. // One important result is that Brazil is returning to the International Monetary Fund , something that was considered unthinkable only last year , when the country unilaterally announced it wouldn ' t pay interest on its $62 billion private foreign debt. // So far , the measures include a federal spending cut to bring the public deficit down to 4 percent of gross domestic product , from an earlier 7 percent projection . There have also been a federal wage freeze , cuts in subsidies and public lending , and a crackdown on tax evaders . The IMF board is expected to approve a standby loan of up to $1. 6 billion this summer. // At the same time , lengthy talks with private bankers to end the moratorium on the debt and provide $5. 2 billion in new lending are coming to a conclusion , officially putting Brazil back as a player in the international finance game. // All the government spending cuts are hurting business , of course . But a sur-prisingly good export performance this year is buoying the sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $1. 9 billion included $2. 79 billion in exports , many of which were shipped by the auto industry . Mr. Mindlin ' s Metal Leve , for example , expects to sell at least $45 million worth of auto parts abroad this year. // While the exports are helping to keep jobs , the income they generate is inflationary , providing yet another reason for opening the Brazilian economy to additional imports. // Even Brazil ' s controversial policy to protect its nascent computer industry , a source of friction with the US , is coming under a new light . Recently , in an interview with the nation ' s influential newsmagazine Veja , President Sarney said he would not vote to protect Brazilian computer manufacturers , if the issue were to come up again , and that the current law doesn ' t work. // ' ' It deprives private enterprise of its most important attributes , ' ' he said , ' ' competitiveness and creativity.
