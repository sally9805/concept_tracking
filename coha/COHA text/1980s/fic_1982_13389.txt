( On the beach . The sound of an airplane landing , then " Coming in From the Cold " by Bob Marley is heard . Lights up . The beach . There are four lawn chairs ; two have towels and beach paraphernalia on them . The family enters , loaded down with more beach paraphernalia . There is a shipwrecked quality to all of the characters in this scene , as if they have woken up in a strange place and do n't quite know where they are . They are being bombarded sensually , by the sun , by the extraordinary vibrancy of the colours , smells , and sounds around them . This is Jamaica , but they might as well be on the moon . ) JOAN ( Talking to invisible beach hustlers . ) What ? No . No . I 'm sorry . . . any what ? FRED No ! We do n't want any !

" They can walk in front by the water , but they ca n't come up here . p. 4 FRED Right . VIC ( To JOAN . ) It 's all right . I 'll take care of you .

Remember that . KAREN Right . ( Pause . ) VIC ( To ROBIN . ) So how 's it going ? ROBIN Great ! It 's amazing what the weather , just the heat , does to you . There 's a real energy here , a sexual energy , you can feel it . CANDY I can feel it . FRED Me too . ROBIN The Jamaicans are just so loose . PEGGY They 're loose all right , the way they look at you . ROBIN But it 's natural , part of their culture . It 's hot all the time . They never have to cover themselves with a lot of clothes . VIC The heat makes you tired , I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affects everything . They seem to do whatever they want to . p. 21 PEGGY That 's what I want to do : whatever I want to . VIC But everybody ca n't do that . JOEY Why not ? JOAN Because nobody would go to work and we 'd all starve . JOEY That 's a straight answer . ROBIN You have to give in to it . The atmosphere tells you how to act . JOEY Sure , but how far would you take it ? ROBIN I 'm sure it goes in all directions . Incest , homosexuality , all kinds of sexual freedom .

FRED I guess if an old fart like me has n't much to tell , he has n't done much with his life . ROBIN We 're all homosexual , of course . It 's just a matter of societal pressure to conform . JOAN Vic is n't . I 'm sure of it . JOEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Robin likes being the devil 's advocate . p. 22 PEGGY I 'll bet he does . FRED What 's he talking about ? ROBIN Sex at an early age is natural here . They all live together in those tiny huts , and when puberty hits , I 'm sure they just let it happen . VIC Well , they 're not going to rape my daughter ? ROBIN Why should n't they rape your daughter ? KAREN Robin , stop playing games . JOEY I think he 's trying to make a philosophical point . VIC About my daughter ? ( To JOEY . ) Tell him she 's only twelve years old and she 's not safe any more . JOAN He 's not talking about Julie , he 's . . . JOEY He says she 's only twelve years old and she 's not . . . ROBIN The black population has a lot to teach us about natural primeval urges . VIC You better think twice about making points about my daughter . KAREN Robin , stop it . You 've had your fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they better keep their hands off her . p. 23 FRED Julie 's in Toronto , Vic , cool off for Christ 's sake ! You do n't know what you 're talking about . And she 's not your daughter , the kids are Joan 's . Just sit on it ! VIC I do know what I 'm talking about . He was saying . . . FRED Enough is enough ! VIC It 's not your daughter he was talking about . FRED No , I do n't have a daughter , but I do have a son , and I thought I taught him how to act with people better than this . KAREN It 's Robin 's fault , he . . . FRED No ! There 's no excuse for bad manners . Vic , you know what to do . VIC I suppose you 're right . I did n't know what I was saying . I 'm sorry . ROBIN It 's no big deal . I get a bit carried away . Too much debating at school . VIC Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know that , and I 'm trying to , you know , loosen up .

PEGGY But tomorrow we 'll go out there and let ' em have it , we 'll be ready . FRED Time to hit the sack . PEGGY Hold it , just a minute . ( Sotto voice to KAREN . ) So you 'll do it with me ? KAREN I can hardly wait . PEGGY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fun . FRED Do what ? PEGGY Never you mind . A woman 's got to have some secrets . FRED You 've got too many secrets . PEGGY See you later . p. 25 FRED ( As they exit . ) What are you up to ? ( Exit FRED and PEGGY . ) CANDY Wow . JOEY They are right off the wall . KAREN So are we . ROBIN I like them . ( Blackout. ) p. 26 Act 1 , Scene 3 Scene Three Mad Dash ( Second day . Morning . Winter adrenaline is racing through their barely warmed-up bodies . Things keep exploding in odd ways and they ca n't figure out why . KAREN and ROBIN are on the beach . ) KAREN I need activity . I do n't know if I can handle this . ROBIN Handle what ? KAREN All this pleasure , it 's driving me crazy . I feel like a block of ice trying to melt . And I ca n't melt . I 'm a failure at melting . Zero out of ten for vacationing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the best lamb 's bread on the island . KAREN I need activity . ( Enter PEGGY and FRED . ) PEGGY Are you trying to tell me we spent all this money coming down here and you do n't want to go to the beach ? What about the sun ? FRED I do n't like the sun . I do n't like the feel of it . I do n't want to get burned , then tanned , then peel . I want to stay inside with the blinds down and a bottle . ( JOAN crosses the stage . ) Hey Joan ! What 's wrong with her ? p. 27 PEGGY I thought we were here to have a good time . FRED I 'm going to have a good time having a bad time , and you 're going to keep me company . PEGGY Oh no you do n't . I 'm going down the beach to sit on my butt and look at the water , and it better look good . ( JOAN approaches . ) JOAN ( To PEGGY . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you seen Vic ? JOAN He just wandered off . I have n't seen him since breakfast . PEGGY He can take care of himself . JOAN I 'm not like you . I get worried . PEGGY About what ? JOAN The mosquitoes for one thing . They put poison in you and you ca n't get it out . They do n't bother Vic . They probably do n't like his blood type . They like mine though . I 'm type " O. " " O " is normal . PEGGY I must be type " X. " Just relax . JOAN I do n't want to relax . I want to go home . PEGGY Are you kidding ? I 'm having the time of my life . p. 28 KAREN Tomorrow I want to check out that native place in the village . Oh , and this guy gave me the name of a place to get magic mushroom and there 's a reggae concert on the beach . ROBIN Slow down , man . Just watch the water . KAREN Right , watch the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back ? ROBIN I 'm going to be a lawyer . KAREN Right , watch the water . JOAN ( To FRED . ) I feel like everyone 's staring . FRED That 's just the way they are . JOAN I mean the white people at the hotel too . I feel like they 're laughing at us . It reminds me of high school , like walking into the cafeteria with the dumb kids , and the cool kids make fart noises when you pass by . I feel like I 'm fifteen again . FRED ( To PEGGY . ) You see ? I found a little lady to pour me drinks . Joan would n't run off and leave her husband all by himself . PEGGY If you wanted Joan you could have had her . With me you got to keep on your toes . And I thought you were going on the wagon . p. 29 FRED I 'm fifty-five years old and I 'm a drunk . PEGGY You 're not a drunk . You drink , but you 're not a drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks Vic 's run off with a calypso dancer . FRED What 's Vic doing running off without telling anybody ? JOAN I think he just went for a walk . FRED A walk ? He 's never been for a walk in his life . You come with me . There 's probably some trouble . You never know what these people will do . Peggy , you hold down the fort . ( Exit FRED and JOAN . ) PEGGY It must be my good looks and charming personality . To hell with them ! I 'm going to buy myself a hat . ( Exit PEGGY . Enter JOEY and CANDY , CANDY in a new two-piece . ) CANDY It 's time for magic , I want the magic back . JOEY Have you been reading Lord of the Rings again ?

I see this bunch of shells , right ? And most of them were the usual thing , then I see this different one with the black markings , so I hold my breath , and down I go . I pull at it , and she wo n't come . Finally it breaks away right in my hand , and I grab the others too . I get back to the surface . Jesus , I was panting ! PEGGY Do I get one ? FRED Everybody gets one . VIC This guy said he 'd only seen one other shell with markings like this , he could n't believe it . ( To JOAN . ) Are you still mad at me ? JOAN No .

I did n't see him at first , it was so dark , then I caught his eye and he crooked his finger at me . I walked over smooth as silk , I just did n't care . He went through the usual jive , he offered me a toke , and it was the kind of stuff that makes you think you 're on the verge of some great discovery , joy becomes so clearcut .

In the morning , when I woke up , he was gone . He was very beautiful . p. 79 CANDY What did he look like ? KAREN I did n't really see him that clearly . It was dark .

KAREN We 're not driving them crazy , we 're letting them go crazy and we have to let them or they 'll have it over us forever . We have to turn it around , bit by bit , and it 's going to hurt . CANDY I do n't want to turn into one of those pinched-faced women . I want to enjoy myself with a man . p. 81 KAREN It 's not pinched , it 's heroic .
