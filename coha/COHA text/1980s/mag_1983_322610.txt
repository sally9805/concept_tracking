THE EMPEROR <P> by Ryszard Kapuscinski <P> Harcourt Brace Jovanovich <P> 164 pages ; $12.95 <P> " On the topmost throne of the world , we are still seated on our rear ends , " observed Montaigne in the 16th century . Just how ludicrous are the presumptions of temporal power was illustrated in 1974 by the dethronement of the King of Kings , Elect of God , Lion of Judah , His Most Puissant Majesty and Distinguished Highness the Emperor of Ethiopia , Haile Selassie . Few 20th century rulers have reigned with more imperial assurance and panache . A charmer , a demagogue and a despot with an implacable will to power , Haile Selassie had contrived for 44 years to present himself to the world as an enlightened monarch and a forward-looking statesman while his subjects remained in boundless poverty and ignorance . <P> Among the few journalists who had been witness to the vagaries of Haile Selassie 's reign was Ryszard Kapuscinski , 52 . A widely traveled former correspondent for the Polish Press Agency , Kapuscinski was evidently impressed by the family resemblance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ababa , Moscow or Warsaw . In fact , the real subject of his ambiguous , compelling memoir is not Haile Selassie 's primitive autocracy . It is modern totalitarianism reduced to its primordial elements . <P> The Emperor offers a trenchant portrait of a 1963 conference of African leaders in the Ethiopian capital . During a gargantuan banquet for more than 3,000 guests in the Emperor 's palace , Kapuscinski ventures outdoors to an area where dishwashers are throwing out leftovers from the banquet tables . A strange sound issues from the far side of the garbage dump . " I noticed that something was moving , shifting , murmuring , squishing , sighing , and smacking its lips . . . In the thick night , a crowd of barefoot beggars stood huddled together . . . I watched the crowd devour the scraps , bones , and fish heads with laborious concentration . In the meticulous absorption of this eating there was an almost violent biological abandon-the satisfaction of hunger in anxiety and ecstasy . " <P> A decade later , after a military coup had toppled Haile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Addis Ababa . With the help of a former official , he set out on a series of surreptitious expeditions to uncover the deposed Emperor 's courtiers and persuade them to tell him about Haile Selassie 's way of life and mode of rule . They confided tales of unbounded slavishness , greed , corruption and palace intrigue . <P> Most titillating are the stories recounted by Haile Selassie 's personal aides , like the keeper of the dog Lulu , which regularly irrigated the shoes of officials who danced attendance on the Emperor . Recalled the keeper : " I had to walk among the dignitaries and wipe the urine from their shoes with a satin cloth . This was my job for ten years . " The function of another aide was to act as the monarch 's animated timepiece , bowing several times as " a signal to His Perspicacious Majesty that one hour was ending and that the time had come to start another . "
