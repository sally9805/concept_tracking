With its black frame , red Naugahyde base and transparent plastic panels , it looks like a cross between a recreation-room bar and an aquarium . Its blue- tinted towers , washed by 200 gallons of liquid coolant , bubble and shimmer / like over-heated Lava Lites . Its nickname is " Bubbles , " and it bears little resemblance to the computers that most Americans have seen . But the $17.6 million Cray-2 is a computer  --  a supercomputer at that  --  and it is the fastest one in operation today . <P> Last week in a brightly lit room at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore , Calif. , the first production model of the Cray-2 gurgled and glowed , and a nearby printer spewed out a string of characters : s905 . B D/U WO/F 06/04 15:24:22 16a . Software Manager Dieter Fuss stared at the message and interpreted it for the assembled Livermore technicians and executives : " It just came alive and said , ' I 'm ready . ' " <P> In that moment , a new era of high-speed computing began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity ( 2 billion bytes ) and a top speed of 1.2 billion FLOPS ( floating point , or arithmetical , operations per second ) , six to twelve times faster than its predecessor , the Cray-1 , and 40,000 to 50,000 times faster than a personal computer . It outdistances the world 's half-dozen other supercomputers  --  machines specially designed to carry out vast numbers of repetitive calculations at incredible speeds  --  and is expected to make short work of problems that have vexed scientists and engineers for decades . Says Robert Borchers , Lawrence Livermore 's associate director for computations : " What took a year in 1952 we can now do in a second . " <P> Who needs such blinding speed ? At the Livermore Lab and NASA 's Ames Research Center in Mountain View , Calif. ( which is scheduled to receive the second Cray-2 in September ) , the new machines will be used for such projects as studying the intense magnetic fields needed for fusion reactors and designing heat shields for future space probes . Meanwhile , demands for ever faster computers are coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from astrophysics to automobile design . Using more powerful supercomputers , aircraft manufacturers will be able to simulate the airflow around an entire airplane , simplifying their design task . Similarly , energy companies will be able to find more oil and meteorologists to make more accurate forecasts , eventually providing earlier warnings of impending storms like last month 's killer tornadoes . <P> U.S. intelligence agencies depend on supercomputers to sort through the enormous quantities of surveillance data beamed home by ground-based listening posts and orbiting spy satellites . By using supercomputers to simulate explosions , nuclear weapons experts require fewer test explosions to validate their designs . Machines like the Cray-2 are essential to any Star Wars defensive system for locating and intercepting incoming missiles before they re-enter the atmosphere .
