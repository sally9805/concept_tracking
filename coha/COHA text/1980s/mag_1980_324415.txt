MasterCard and Visa bitterly fight the plastic money war <P> It looks and feels like a credit card , and it can ring up purchases as easily . But MasterCard II , which was introduced last week , is not the same as familiar plastic money . With a normal credit card , the bill for a shopping spree may not arrive for weeks . But with MasterCard II , which bankers call a debit card , payment takes place instantly . A computer deducts funds from the shopper 's bank account and transfers them into that of the store or restaurant where purchases have been made . Cardholders may carry either the regular MasterCard , MasterCard II , or both . <P> MasterCard II is another salvo in the continuing battle between Interbank Card Association , whose 11,000 members are the financial institutions , primarily banks , that issue MasterCard , and rival Visa International , which has about 11,500 members . MasterCard ( formerly Master Charge ) and Visa are each carried by more than 60 million people in the U.S. , but the tide of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately 6 million more people carried Master Charge than Visa , then called BankAmericard . Through shrewd marketing , and a court ruling that allowed banks to issue both cards , Visa now leads . <P> Seven months ago , Russell Hogg ( rhymes with vogue ) , 50 , became president of MasterCard , and set out to take back leadership in bank credit cards . A craggy onetime FBI agent with executive experience at American Express and American Airlines , Hogg promptly fired eight top officials and laid plans for a host of new products . The debit card is soon to be followed by a Japanese MasterCard and traveler 's checks . <P> MasterCard will have to struggle . Five years ago , Visa introduced the first debit card , and last November it branched into traveler 's checks . The checks have gained ground rapidly against the long-dominant American Express , partly because of the prominence of the Visa name . This year Visa expects to capture more than 10% of the market worldwide . Moreover , many bankers and merchants think that while MasterCard may carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries class . The name Visa seems to spell easy access , a door-opener around the world . Says one New York banker : " MasterCard is taken more as a card for blue-collar people . " <P> Yet both cards face serious troubles . In the past , most profits have come from consumers who only paid interest on their bills rather than settling them in full each month . But when interest rates soared last spring , banks lost money on their card business . Indeed , Jack Cox , publisher of a newsletter about bank cards , estimates that U.S. banks lost at least $250 million on credit card operations in the first half of 1980 . <P> Then came the Carter Administration 's credit squeeze in March . Many people simply stopped using their cards , and some people even sent them to the White House as a symbol of swearing off demon plastic . MasterCard use fell 8.4% during the first quarter of the year , and from March to July Americans decreased their consumer debt by about $6 billion .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
