I am concerned about world opinion , but I am also concerned about the lives of our soldiers . No army will fail to defend the lives of its soldiers . We are on our way out . Why the hell are they shooting at the backs of our soldiers ? The cynicism was brought to an all-time high by ( the anti-Israeli statements of Lebanese President ) Amin Gemayel . We helped the Gemayel family , we helped the Christians unconditionally when they were in difficulty . <P> On future withdrawal plans . We are already preparing ourselves to defend the northern part of Israel from Israeli territory . We shall maintain a mobile defense . No serious Israeli ever suggested that we should remain in Lebanon forever . Also , our presence in Lebanon has not made it a more balanced country . It is becoming more and more Shi'ite , and the Shi'ites are becoming more and more militant . <P> On conflicts within his Cabinet over the withdrawal policy . In English , one says , ' When in doubt , leave out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in doubt . <P> On Israel 's economic problems . We cut a billion and a half dollars in real terms from a budget that was extremely difficult to cut . It was a terrible year , like a drought , but what could I do ? I felt if we cut too much we would lose the people 's confidence . But I think that within a year the economy will have recovered . In my heart I do n't want to do what some of the European countries have done , and that is to go into deep unemployment . I prefer to spread the burden more equally . <P> On the Hussein-Arafat agreement . We can not accept that the P.L.O . will % become a party to the negotiations . I have been asked , ' Do n't you have terrorists in Israel ? ' Yes , we have people who were terrorists . We do n't have people who are terrorists . If somebody is a terrorist , we put him in prison . The P.L.O . is still engaged in terror . Shooting and talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the Egyptians would like to have a comprehensive peace , and they would like to see the whole Middle East moving toward peace . The Jordanians , basically , also . The P.L.O . too . All of them  --  maybe like all of us  --  are prisoners of past worries , prejudices and superstitions . The Egyptians feel that for the time being the political-negotiations camp may consist of themselves and the Jordanians ; they also say the Iraqis and the Algerians , and the Palestinians . Nobody is mentioning Syria . It heads the camp of belligerence and refusal . So let it be where it is . On the Arab side , they say , ' O.K. , maybe there are people who are not members of the P.L.O . who can participate in delegations , yet represent the same approach as the P.L.O . ' I think it would be wrong on my side to suggest to the Arabs how they should compose their delegation . <P> On the need for a settlement . Peace is a must for us and a must for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of past wars should come to the only sane conclusion  --  which is to solve the problems diplomatically and peacefully . Even if someone tells me , ' Look , your chances are very dim , ' I would n't change my conviction or my optimism . If you lose optimism , you 're out of business .
