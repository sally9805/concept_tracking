In his first interview after being sworn in , Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou had mixed emotions about the U.S. and its relationship to the Greece he will govern . Excerpts from his session with TIME Rome Bureau Chief Wilton Wynn and Athens Reporter Mirka Gondicas : <P> On the U.S. bases in Greece . Foreign bases are not proper for our territory . We do n't want to get involved in a holocaust that is not of our making . But I will not close the U.S. bases unilaterally . We want to work on a timetable for their removal , mutually agreed upon . Meanwhile , those bases are American and of necessity will be commanded by American officers . But we insist that there be a Greek officer in charge of information and control , so that no operation will be started from Greece against a third country with whom we have good diplomatic relations . <P> On NATO . Here is a unique problem : we belong to NATO , but this alliance refused to guarantee our frontiers against Turkish attack .

What they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . But the name of President Franklin Roosevelt evoked a positive reaction among all democratic Greeks . I was impressed with the openness of American society . I admired people like Adlai Stevenson : he was my friend and I was his representative in Minnesota . Later I had close contacts with the advisers of President Kennedy . I personally have a great deal of gratitude for the chance given me in the U.S. to grow up as a scientist and professor . Not only is my wife American , but my children are American-born , and many , many of my friends are American . <P> On his alienation from the U.S. The Johnson Administration made certain statements critical of the military dictatorship that ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974 , but in substance the U.S. and NATO accepted it . The second blow came in 1974 when Turkish troops armed by NATO and the U.S. , using arms in violation of American law , invaded Cyprus . The third blow , and one still very much alive , is Turkey 's claim on the Aegean while the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
