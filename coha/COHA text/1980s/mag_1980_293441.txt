WHAT ONLY A MOTHER CAN TELL YOU ABOUT HAVING A BABY by K.C. Cole ; Anchor/Doubleday 318 pages ; $10.95 <P> Childbirth remains one of the most grotesque and transcendent of all natural functions , matched perhaps only by its necessary preliminary . Everything about the process is astonishing . Especially the baby . Science Writer K.C. Cole , despite her own and her husband 's most diligent efforts to know exactly what was happening , was still surprised . As she writes , " There is a wide range of things , it seems , that nobody ever tells you about having a baby . " Her book , aptly titled What Only a Mother Can Tell You About Having a Baby , tries to narrow that range . <P> For her research , Cole taped interviews with groups of mothers and sent out hundreds of questionnaires . Unfortunately , her research included no unmarried mothers , no one who had had a woman obstetrician and no one who had had a baby at home . Still , her initial discovery applies to anyone in pregnancy : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the exception . " Her book , which includes many viewpoints and possibilities , is a kind of print-version support group , and , as she suggests , should be read along with all the other how-to-have-a-baby books . <P> Many of those books are written by doctors and , while soberly reassuring and biologically informative , tend to address private qualms in a condescending manner . Cole 's book is breezy , full of quotes from mothers , and reassuring . She points out , for example , the almost always overlooked distinction between being pregnant and actually being a mother . " While the two are biologically connected , emotionally they may have nothing in common at all . " In other words , if you are eight months pregnant and find someone else 's baby a repulsive blob , you have not necessarily made a horrible mistake . <P> Living with the baby is the lesson , and it is one not only mothers can learn : " I can certainly sympathize with a father who does n't want to be a witness to the pain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of birth : all that blood and gore . I absolutely understand why he would want to avoid dirty diapers . And I believe him when he says he does n't know the first thing about caring for a baby . That 's exactly how most mothers feel . The difference is , most mothers do n't have a choice . " <P> These days , an informed father is essential , not least , in Cole 's book , because he is the mother 's backup in her struggles with the obstetrician . Male doctors are not exactly the heroes of this book . For all is not peaceful birthing rooms and tranquil , exultant deliveries , as older mothers once hoped . According to Cole , women who have placed their faith in the teachings of Fernand Lamaze , Frederick Leboyer , Elizabeth Bing and other advocates of natural childbirth will , almost automatically , find themselves in an adversary position when they enter the hospital . She writes : " The truth is that childbirth in America is getting more unnatural every day . A woman expecting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caesarean . Even a ' natural ' birth often means that the mother is merely ' awake ' for the proceedings . Never mind that she 's strapped down , numb below the waist , electronically monitored , chemically induced , and intravenously fed . "
