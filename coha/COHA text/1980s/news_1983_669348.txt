Few Europeans or Americans will notice the difference. // Although the arrival of American missiles may create new East-West tensions , trade with the Soviets is back to normal , and tensions between the United States and its allies over the commerce have lessened. // Spats over high-technology exports continue . But they are off the front pages , confined to a little-known , secrecy-obsessed organization called the Coordinating Committee for Export Control ( Cocom ) . // At the same time , progress seems to have been made in resolving transatlantic differences . From the European perspective , the Reagan administration seems to have accepted that commercial links with the Soviets can not be cut . From the US perspective , the Europeans have also made compromises , ending soft credits to the Soviets and restricting militarily sensitive exports. // ' ' The United States took measures , then abandoned them , so now there is a certain serenity , ' ' explains Elizabeth Bukspun of the French Foreign Trade Ministry. // ' ' The French attitude towards strategic technologies has become a bit more malleable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that the Europeans have converted into hard-line American-style believers in economic ' ' warfare . ' ' Politically , they continue to think that economic ties with the East cool tensions. // Exports to the East total only a small part of their trade . And experts at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) do not expect these exports to grow very quickly in the next few years. // But with Europe recovering slowly and its traditional Middle Eastern and African markets slumping , the commerce retains an importance out of proportion to its size. // In France , for example , sales to the Soviet Union are crucial for the country ' s major engineering and construction firms . Technip reports that in 1982 it did almost 10 percent of its business with the Soviets . Creusot Loire admits it would have gone bankrupt if it did not have about $1 billion of work contracted on the gas pipeline. // ' ' We want to keep our people working , ' ' says Bukspun at the Foreign Trade Ministry . ' ' The Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise , then , that the Europeans have launched an export campaign . Last year , they frantically competed to develop a gas field at Astrakhan in the Volga region . French firms , including Creusot and Technip , finally beat out German and Canadian competitors for contracts worth about $700 million . This year , the Europeans are bidding to develop another large Soviet gas field at Tengiz. // The Reagan administration worries that this competition translates into dependence on the Soviets - especially when imports as well as exports are considered . Soviet exports to the West rose by 10 percent during 1982 and 4 percent in the first half of this year . In Eastern Europe as a whole , exports increased by 4 percent - the first rise in three years. // With the construction of the new pipeline , European Community officials contacted in Brussels admit that by 1990 , Russia will be Europe ' s No. 1 gas supplier. // Soviet oil exports are expected to decline , however , so deliveries at their peak will represent meet only 5 to 6 percent of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level is not a threat. // ' ' The Russians are an important supplier , ' ' admits Francois Lecorre of the French Foreign Trade Ministry . ' ' But they are not crucial . We could replace their supplies quickly. ' ' // With the pipeline moving ahead on schedule and the Europeans scrambling to trade even more with the Soviets , how have the tensions over the commerce been toned down ? Common interests , European and American officials say , were always stronger than the differences. // Take subsidized credits . The US goal has long been to end all such subsidies . But the Europeans feared sales to the Soviets would disappear without the lower rates. // After much haggling , an agreement on a ' ' consensus ' ' interest rate was reached at a fall meeting of the OECD . The French were able to keep some subsidies , but minimum financing for projects to the East was placed at just above 12 percent - a rate that satisfied the US. // Why did both sides compromise ? // ' ' If we hadn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' explains Bukspun . ' ' We don ' t like the high interest rates , but such a war would have been bad for everyone. ' ' // Progress also seems to have been made on the issue of high-technology exports . In principle , the Europeans have always agreed that the Soviet Union should be denied strategically valuable materials . In practice , though , the European definition of strategically valuable has been much looser than the American definition. // But the disagreements are less severe than before , diplomats close to the Cocom negotiations say . The US has realized that it can not blacklist everything vaguely strategic , and that it must negotiate , not unilaterally impose sanctions. // Cocom ' s European members , meanwhile , have stiffened their checking procedures on high-technology exports . The French have instituted an interministerial checking procedure , and West German officials recently cooperated with the US to stop a shipment of computers Eastward. // ' ' Outstanding issues remain , ' ' says a diplomat involved in the negotiations . ' ' But the general strategic concept is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within this general consensus will always exist . The Europeans ' fear of Soviet power makes them amenable to controlling exports of sensitive materials . At the same time , forging strong commercial links with the East is in their interest. // The Europeans note , with smiles , that the same friction exists in the US. // ' ' The reality is that America will also sell as much as it can to Russia , ' ' Bukspun says . ' ' Remember who lifted their own embargo because of internal political pressure ? And who sold all that grain to Russia ? ' ' // //
