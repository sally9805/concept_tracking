On the <P> <P> Road <P> The Democrats come up short of unity and cash <P> The idea seemed promising : for two whole days , the eight contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination would stop taking potshots at one another and instead travel together across the U.S. , preaching party unity and raising money . The proceeds , an anticipated $2.4 million , would go to the campaign chest of the eventual winner . <P> But unity never comes easily to Democrats , nor does fund raising . Before the Democrats even set forth last week in a pair of DC-8 jets , Jesse Jackson accused party leaders of " stacking the deck " against outsiders , minorities and the poor . Alan Cranston refused to join the trip because of a squabble with Party Chairman Charles Manatt , and Reubin Askew bowed out when his mother-in-law died . At the first stop in Atlanta , Gary Hart insinuated that John Glenn was a closet Republican . Glenn , meanwhile , suggested that Walter Mondale was a big-spending liberal . In Chicago , Party Boss Edward Vrdolyak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold Washington , a battle so bitter that the Democrats ' once assured ability to " deliver " Cook County can now be called into question . A lunch in St. Louis was canceled for lack of interest , and many seats were left empty at a $500-a-plate breakfast in Atlanta . At the last stop , in Albuquerque , Ernest ( " Fritz " ) Rollings pronounced both the Glenn and Mondale campaigns to be " mush . " <P> At its merciful conclusion , the trip had netted only $1.1 million . The party seemed only tenuously united , and the candidates had trouble rising above the internecine sniping . With one exception : Jesse Jackson stirred audiences at every stop with his blunt style and rousing rhetoric . Even party fat cats paying $1,000 a plate for a prime-rib dinner in Albuquerque cheered his populist message , delivered in the cadences of a revival preacher , calling for " unity without uniformity " and attacking Ronald Reagan as a " reverse <P> Robin Hood , " who stole from the poor to give to the rich . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jackson cried , bringing the mostly white male audience to its feet . Marveled a Glenn aide : " If we had a speaking contest , Jesse would win . " Agreed Rollings : " Jesse 's having a big time . " <P> Jackson was also giving Democratic leaders fits by challenging the party 's rules . Charging that the delegate-selection process discriminated against outsiders like himself , Jackson demanded major reforms before the primaries begin . In so doing , he became a lightning rod for other disaffected long shots . Hart , Rollings and George McGovern all jumped to second Jackson 's complaints . Hart was so enthralled by the limelight shining on Jackson that he decided to share it , and word spread that he would begin making joint appearances with the charismatic preacher . " The rules make the party undemocratic , " charged McGovern . " They help a front runner , a candidate with money who is first out of the box . "                    @
