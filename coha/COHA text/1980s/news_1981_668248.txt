John Halberstadt is having big problems with his dharma . Dharma , he explains , is a philosphical concept from India . Your dharma is what you were meant to be . Some men are destined to be plumbers , others are meant to be poets . Halberstadt is said to have been the smartest kid ever to come out of Malone , N.Y . They had to send him out of town to a more challenging high school . He holds three master ' s degrees and a doctorate in English literaturefrom Yale . A published article derived from his doctoral dissertation on Thomas Wolfe caused such an uproar in the academic world that he has been the subject of lengthy stories in the New York Times and Village Voice . What ' s wrong with Halberstadt ' s dharma is that his most recent job , the best he could find , was as a bagel bagger at Freedman ' s Bakery in Quincy Market . While Halberstadt acknowledges it is possible that his dharma was to be a bagel bagger all along , that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does offer another explanation . " The age that we ' re living in is said to be a time of adharma , " he notes , " that is , a time in which the whole struture of dharma , of allotted duties , is in decay , and it ' s a real mess . " At the root of Halberstadt ' s decaying dharma is the lack of jobs in the academic community . And where else do you go with a doctorate in English lit ? Halberstadt did have a teaching position at Northeastern , but he knew that was only temporary . To make matters worse , as a result of the academic squabble he ' s been barred for a year from Harvard ' s Houghton Library . An academician barred from Houghton is like a gunfighter barred from the OK Corral . Going from the posthumous works of Thomas Wolfe to mixing lox and cream cheese is a tricky transition , and Halberstadt ' s job is not without its problems . Halberstadt may know all about Beowulf , but he knew nothing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Freedman ' s . " I don ' t think the boss thinks I learn fast enough , " says the man with three master ' s and a PhD . " He told me to get a list . I ' ve got a list , but I don ' t know what to look for . When somebody asks me for bearclaws , I don ' t know what they are . Not only that , I don ' t know where to look for them . I can ' t picture them . I never heard of them ! " Still , Halbertstadt is happy in the job he ' s overqualified for . " I actually enjoy it , " he says . " I only wish the salary were higher . It ' s a very relaxing job . There ' s no politics . There ' s no infighting . You sell bagels and Whoopee Pies and so on , and that ' s all that ' s expected of you , and there ' s a certain pleasure in that . There ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among employees . " And all of us can take heart , for the same Indian philosophy that deals with dharma states that we are living in an Age of Enlightenment , and how much more enlightened can we be than having a man entitled to put " Dr. " in front of his name dishing out our Whoopee Pie ? The future is brighter for John Halberstadt , too . When we last talked to him he was giving up the bakery and had begun a training progam at the Holiday Inn in Cambridge to become a desk clerk . What sort of educational background is needed to become a hotel desk clerk ? " Absolutely none , " said Halberstadt.
