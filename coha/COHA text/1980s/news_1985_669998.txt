Cocoa futures prices fell because of several unexpected developments indicating that world supplies of cocoa beans will be greater than anticipated . The December contract attracted most of the selling , falling $81 a metric ton to $2 , 185 . The market was hit by " a plethora of bearish news " that triggered aggressive selling , said William O ' Neill , research director for Rudolf Wolff Futures Inc . , New York . The plunging prices touched off selling orders that traders had placed below prevailing levels to protect profits , Mr. O ' Neill said . The December contract dropped below $2 , 250 a ton , regarded as a significant support point , and then through the secondary support level of $2 , 200 , he said . Three pieces of news hit the market yesterday :  --  The United Kingdom , a major chocolate-consuming country , ground fewer cocoa beans in the third quarter than traders had expected.  --  A report indicated that the industry may have a surplus of cocoa beans when the current season ends in September 1986 , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and traders.  --  Record output was reported by the Ivory Coast , a major producing nation . United Kingdom grindings of cocoa beans in the third quarter fell almost 5. 4% to 19 , 981 metric tons from 21 , 120 tons a year earlier . The range of traders ' and analysts ' expectations was from 5% lower to 7% higher , but most guesses had been for a moderate decline . The 1984-85 season ended Sept. 30 with a surplus of 115 , 000 metric tons of cocoa beans . Some traders and analysts had predicted the 1985-86 season would show a deficit of as much as 20 , 000 tons because of persistent reports of weather problems in major growing areas . However , a report released yesterday by Gill &; Duffus , a major London commodity-trading firm , indicated that the season may end with a surplus of 12 , 000 tons . " This tends to discredit , to some degree , the stories that were rampant during the year about weather problems and possible damage to cocoa beans by pod rot in West Africa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivory Coast crop report had the least effect of the factors in yesterday ' s market . The Ivory Coast said it would harvest about 7 , 000 tons more than previously estimated , but traders said they already were aware the crop would be large . In other commodity markets yesterday : CURRENCIES : The Swiss franc led most major foreign currency futures prices lower in thin , lackluster trading . Traders sold contracts partly in response to expectations that U.S. government reports scheduled to be released soon will show continued moderate economic growth , analysts said .

Hog futures rose because traders are expecting packers to bid higher prices for the animals today to step up Saturday ' s normally light slaughter rate . The reason is that packers ' profit margins are currently healthy . Pork-belly futures rose as well , but some analysts say prices of such pork products as bellies and hams are showing some weakness in cash markets , which suggests futures prices may slip in the next few trading sessions . ENERGY : Oil futures prices plummeted . Traders heard rumors that three major U.S. oil companies were taking delivery of Saudi Arabian crude from stocks established in the Caribbean by Norbec , a trading company representing Saudi Arabia , said Walter Zimmerman , assistant vice president of E.F.
