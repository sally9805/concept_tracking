( She points to Cora ) the woman standing yonder was Daniel Larman 's sister . She has a baby by that man there , give it up and now wants it back .

Jean Margaret , her name was . A mimed wedding and christening . Harlan shakes hands with Starns . HARLAN I do feel better for these charms and spells . I thank ye . STARNS Do n't say nothing about it . JUBA And that night , a wedding dance , with mountain beer Starns knowed how to brew , jest water poured over bumblebee combs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough of a drunk to dance right , and we did . Billy , Juba , Cora and Harlan look with wonder at a great crowd coming to a barn dance . Starns and the Bishop stand aside .

They look at each other , hoot , and run together to Starns , surrounding him , pulling him out on the dance floor , breaking away and leaving him there . They clap , urge him on . Starns steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster , then with a whoop , he dances before them , face , hands and body stiff but his feet flying . STARNS Hooo-EEEE ! ! ! ! Then Starns staggers away , wiping his face , and grinning . Cora , Harlan and Juba turn their backs , and , to softer music , dance again , in place . BILLY When his lungs give out , Starns went outside , and so did I and so did the Bishop . The Bishop stands behind Starns . Billy watches them . A sound of wind . Music.We looked out at the mountain night , over the graves and the Missionhouse Valley . Faint were the fiddles , hardly heard the dancing feet , because the night wind blew loud and cold down the great steeps and ridges , but we heard them , and we knew the Missionhouse was alive , like a heart in a strong body . Starns breathes deeply . The music is very soft . Cora , Juba and Harlan sway slowly to the music . p. 46 STARNS My own . BILLY A kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be more than this .

BISHOP Earth will lead us to heaven . BILLY Three years of it ! Of happiness beyond description , in Heathen Valley ! Cold , fierce mountain wind. @x As before . Starns sits on the crate , reading from a ledger . The Bishop listens to him , but paces back and forth , bothered . He carries a black garment , rolled up , under his arm . Billy watches . STARNS Baptisms , sixteen . Confirmations , ten . Marriages , six . Burials , eight . Offerings , four dollar and eight cent . Divine services have been held at places following , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September the tenth , at the store of James Rode above Carson 's Fall  --  ( His voice becomes lower as he continues reading , and Billy speaks over him )  --  and there was one soul received . On September twenty-second , in front of a cabin owned by a Mr. Hartfoot , I do n't know just where but it 's marked on the map . There was no one received , but many stood and listened and received the gospel in a kindly way . BILLY ( Over Starns ) : It became a ritual , every year , on your spring visit , Bishop . Starns tallying every sacrament , every service , every lesson , every penny , every nail , and you would listen . STARNS Forty-seven children now in the school , thirty boarding through winter . Preaching circuit a circumference of sixty-five mile . Two cots have been added to the clinic and a pine table on which a man can be laid for treatment . The Bishop turns away , paces .

BISHOP It is good to be happy , when we are young . STARNS Hit is of a sartin ! BISHOP ( Pacing ) : And it is dangerous . We can love the earth too much . STARNS Huh ? Sorry , I was watching Cora . BISHOP We came here to change a people who forgot God . They did it then in riots and orgies . They can do it again , in dances , farming , schooling . The danger is the same . STARNS Yessir , ' at 's so . Now , there 's three hundred fifty-five acre of wheat and buckwheat , barley , potatoes  --  BILLY Was it here it happened ? Over three years ? WHEN ? ? ?

BILLY Then whose fault was it ? You 'd say Starns ! BISHOP No , I would n't . BILLY He 'd say you . BISHOP Yes , he would . BILLY Would he be right ? BISHOP No . BILLY Why not ? It has to be somebody ! BISHOP You are an orphan , my boy , and you think that a home on earth is the answer to everything . It is n't . BILLY Then what is ? BISHOP The answer to everything is God , alone . What that means . Where that is . When I was a boy  --  BILLY I do n't want a sermon from you ! BISHOP This is n't one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . BISHOP As your friend ? BILLY Yes . BISHOP Then do not judge me . When I was a boy , I was alone , too . Both my mother and my father were atheists . And I knew that they were wrong , and that I would spend all my life , every hour of every day , finding God . Not some idea of God . Not some pale abstract Divinity with a lukewarm sun for a face . Not some stupid thundering Father , with a fist for a reason . God . Think , Billy . The power that moves the stars . The answer to every yearning . To the riddles we can not even imagine exist , much less solve . The God of Job and the God of every tiny insect . I knew I would find God while I lived , and for that day , for that moment , all my life on earth was only a preparation . All my studies in school , nothing else . All my advancement in the churches , nothing else . All my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that happened here , nothing else ? Only a preparation for you to find God ? BISHOP Exactly ! Look no further , Billy , This is why everything had to be as it was . BILLY Is that what happened to you then ? BISHOP Yes . BILLY In Heathen Valley ? BISHOP In Heathen Valley , I found God . At last . BILLY Then what happened , had to . BISHOP Of course . Light fades from them , back to what it was forget God . I wo n't . BISHOP That is not what I said . Enter Juba .

JUBA Over the mountains , at midnight . And on her filthy skirt , the dead babies lie , scared and crying in the black night , a-moaning and a-wailing  --  oh , hit is powerful spooky ! ( She chuckles ) Scared them Tates witless , and that no good Morris girl , too . BISHOP May I ask the point of this unpleasant fairy tale ? JUBA So long , Starns . STARNS Hold on , Juba . Bishop do n't understand . Be patient with him . JUBA The point of the fairy tale , Bishop , is I git wore out midwifing a bastard baby I know will get murdered by its momma , or its head smashed in by its daddy , or left in the pigpen to git stomped into slop and et by the sow . If'n Old Bertha kin help that condition , then she will , whether you like it or not . Exit Juba . Enter Harlan . HARLAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this charm out of birch bark , Jean 's hair , and goat 's blood . It 's a charm for me and my chillun . I want it spoken over . p. 53 STARNS Ask the Bishop . HARLAN I have come to accept spells and charms . For the protection of my family , I made this here . I want you to say something to it and give it some power . BISHOP I ca n't do that . HARLAN Why not ? BISHOP Such charms do n't exist . HARLAN You wo n't speak to it ? BISHOP No . HARLAN Starns , will you ? STARNS Give it here . ( He takes it from Harlan ) Whatever power I got in me , I hope goes right into whatever this is , to help Harlan and protect Jean . That good enough ? HARLAN Of a sartin .

STARNS Yessir . Ca n't say why myself . BISHOP Yes , you can ! This is the woman we married ? Changed her from her primitive ways ? Living adulterously with her brother ? STARNS Only twict a week ! BISHOP Starns ! STARNS I do n't know it fer sartin . BISHOP Well , find out . And if she is , stop it ! STARNS You reckon that 's so easy ! BISHOP I do n't care if it 's easy or not ! Stop it ! STARNS I heared you . BISHOP Old Bertha , flying through the air ? A grisly totem , made out of goat 's blood ? Organized incest ? These practices must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusions . STARNS Well , I ca n't tell them that . BISHOP Why not ? STARNS I ca n't say here 's Almighty God with a daddy-white beard , sitting on a golden throne divided in three parts of some Trinity while a Virgin never touched goes and has His divine baby , and then turn around and tell them they are a-living in some barbaric illusion . You want to , go ahead . p. 55 BISHOP I will . Starns goes back to the crate . STARNS I got to get on with my accounts now . BISHOP By all means . STARNS ( Reading again ) : Beans , clover and hay , and best of all them cabbages that do so well . Now since January 1st , 1859 , we 've had  --  The Bishop resumes his pacing . Billy follows , watching . BILLY ( Over Starns ) : Bishop , listen to him . It 's a farm that prospers , a school that teaches , a hospital that heals and a church that does n't presume .

STARNS Huh ? BISHOP That is not so simple . STARNS Nossir . BISHOP First , you must know what it is . STARNS Huh ? BISHOP You do n't understand what I 'm talking about . STARNS Yes , I do . Wanting God . I reckon we do . BISHOP Are we hungry for God here ? Or do we farm and sweat and eat cabbages , do what we please , think what we please , trade one superstition for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . We go to church , too . BISHOP Like a party , or a house-raising or a meeting hall ? Another merry scene ? STARNS Oh , I see what you mean . Yeah , too much laughing in church , you 're right . BISHOP That 's not what I mean . STARNS Well , what do you mean ? BILLY You do n't come to it all at once . But over the years , with the Bishop 's visits , we hear it , words getting sharper , hard looks colder , and longer . p. 57 BISHOP We need more than cabbages . STARNS What 's wrong with my cabbages ? BISHOP We must rise above them , somehow . STARNS How ? We 're down here , ai n't we ? BISHOP Where your happiness will not last ! STARNS Hit shore wo n't if the crops ai n't in . Bishop , you mean we ai n't being good-enough Christians somehow ? That it ? BISHOP That is not it . STARNS What is ? BISHOP We must hunger !

BILLY Starns , watch out ! STARNS I understand , all right , you 're picking us to pieces . BISHOP How will we worship our God ? With cabbages and corn , and bucolic pride , like a country fool ? STARNS Do n't reckon I fancy being called a country fool . p. 58 BILLY He did n't call you a fool . STARNS Yes , he did . Mountain people ai n't religious like you are . They feel it ! They worship . But they do n't bend no knees ! It ai n't in their nature ! BISHOP If we forget our Lord Jesus Christ , then we have not done the work of the Lord here , we have done the work of the Devil , and I will have none of it ! Starns ! BILLY Not like this . Do n't . BISHOP I will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the land . There will be no manual labor performed at this Mission on sundays , sunup to sundown . STARNS Chilluns have to work on Sundays , some !

The Bishop holds out the folded black garment . Billy takes it.But why ? BISHOP To bring us all closer to God . BILLY Are n't we close enough as it is ? p. 59 BISHOP I think not .
