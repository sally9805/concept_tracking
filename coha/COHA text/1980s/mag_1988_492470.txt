particular character bent runs , like a vein through a lobster , deep within lovers of old houses . Call it flaw or passion , the phenomenon manifests itself in many ways ; while other people snuggle safe in their condos or new homes , the old-house aficionado may be poking through a decrepit structure with ice pick and flashlight . Even though the pick may sink to the hilt in a wooden member , the decaying post does n't represent just " damage . " It hints at rescuing an almost-living thing and restoring its charm and elegance . Home restoration , a large , loosely knit genre , has grown continually in popularity for the past 15 years . Although its scope is quite large , the movement 's diversity makes it virtually impossible to compile accurate data . There is no national organization devoted strictly to home restoration . Housing-industry experts can say only that the actual numbers lie somewhere in the $92 billion industry sector encompassing remodeling , do-it-yourself ( DIY ) , and restoration . This part of the housing industry reports figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although finished masterpieces receive the most media attention , home The born restorationist has an eye for a neglected treasure that once restored epitomizes charm and elegance . restoration is not at all confined to the purist . Home rescue also entails the reclamation of a modest row house , a four-room country home , or a comparatively new structure dating from , for instance , the late 1930s . The Old House Journal , published in Brooklyn , New York , is the bible of the serious home-rehabber . The publication features numerous home styles . " We basically cover houses from about 1750 to 1940 , " OHJ editor and publisher Patricia Poore explains . " Our concentration is on the late Victorian and early 20th century . This is because that 's where most of the availability is  --  there are not that many 1750s houses left now . " Poore ( whose company also publishes a valuable catalog of restora tion materials and services ) affirms that interest has now widened to rescuing homes of many periods .

" The largest concentration of properties with historic restoration value is found in the Northeast . The movement to rescue old living spaces , though , is certainly not restricted today to densely populated regions . National observers are finding that , as interest in the idiom widens , people are enlivening older houses from deserts to marshlands , and in rural areas as well as in small towns . " Take my hometown of Kalamazoo , Michigan , for example , " notes Mark Feirer , managing editor of Fine Homebuilding , which covers some restoration in addition to its new-construction emphasis . " Just about anywhere you go , if you have an eye that turns to those sort of things , you can spot a neat old house . " ? ?

" There 's a similarity between jumping into rehabbing an old house and getting into a treasure hunt , " observes Bob Vila , an author and the host of the popular show " This Old House , " aired nationally on PBS and produced by Boston 's WGBH . " A lot of people are turned on to the idea of discovering or salvaging . It 's just as romantic a notion as going after sunken treasure to be able to salvage , restore , and discover the beauties of a 100-year-old structure . " Most observers agree that the allure This old house ( below ) offered Bob Vila , host of PBS 's " This Old House , " his first challenge . of an old house , with all its expectable neglect , is largely emotional .

However , the prospect of " sweat equity " ? building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's self  --  is often a must in the budgetary picture of a restoration project . " The born restorationist , " Feirer says , chuckling , " sort of looks at an old house and just melts inside . It 's like somebody seeing a stray kitty ; you want to take it in and make it all cozy and warm  --  whether it wants to be cozy and warm or not . And it 'll fight you , just like a stray cat , until it finally gives in and you 've got a nice kitty that 'll sit on your lap . " Poore takes an equally subjective ? and accurate  --  view . " There definitely is that factor , " she says . " It 's falling in love with the idea of bringing something back .

In 1982 , April Chapman bought a 3,500-square-foot Queen Anne cottage near downtown Athens , Georgia . A rental property since the 1940s , the house had been routinely bashed by three generations of University of Georgia students . It was built in 1886 by Calvin W. Parr , a noted Athens artist and interior decorator . Chapman , an art teacher , learned Hard work on the once-rundown Massachusetts house paid off , launch-ing Vila 's interesting career . that the house had once been a showpiece for Parr 's talents . She discovered ornate fresco work hidden under five coats of enamel paint and wallpaper . Elaborately painted scenes were found in three ceiling areas . " The frescoes , " Chapman says , " were actually done in the wet plaster . Otherwise , there would 've been no way to save them . The house was definitely done in Victorian high style . The scenes have classic Italian busts and griffins . " After two years of painstaking work , Chapman has recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've felt like Michelangelo , " she says with a laugh , " lying on my back up near the ceiling and working on it . 1 love to show the house , though . " No matter what attracts a family to the idea of saving an old home , the realities should not be overlooked . In 1981 , my wife , Mary Ellen , and I bought a 3,300-square-foot wreck that had started out in 1920 as a suburban Atlanta bungalow . It had been added on to at least three times , and every inch of it had suffered fire damage , neglect , or downright abuse . After a brief honeymoon-like period of picking our way among the debris and saying " This is ours , " we settled into the reality of what we had taken on . We did n't really mind that the house was architecturally schizophrenic and of no particular historic value . We liked its nine-foot ceilings and the twin sets of French doors that led to a screened porch .

Neither of us had any experience working on houses . 1 had some automotive knowledge and Mary Ellen had studied art in college . We attacked the mess anyway , working at night and on weekends . We found reading specialty books very useful . Their information cut down on mistakes and hastened such projects as painting and wall-ceiling repair . For a long time I 've been an advocate of using quality tools , regardless of the project . Amid all the cordless power tools and specialty devices , though , it 's amusing how handy certain everyday items can be . An old high-school auditorium chair proved to be one of our most called-for pieces . The " Chamblee chair , " at a cost of zero , is still with us . Some rehab projects become epics of almost Homerian proportions . Barbara Thornberg , a contributing editor for Metropolitan Home , and her husband began one such odyssey in 1973 by purchasing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4,000-square-foot home and the carriage barn in the rear are virtually finished , the couple having done most of the work themselves . " It was an incredible project , " Thornberg says . " I only have one of these in me  --  in a lifetime . I love the house , we both do , but never again . We set the house on fire three times , and my husband fell off a 30-foot scaffold while painting  --  he was unhurt , though . There is , however , a great deal of satisfaction involved . " In 1984 , Old House Journal 's Poore took on a slightly different challenge a continent away : an " uninhabitable " row house in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn . " We moved in anyway , " she says , laughing . In 1983 , Joe Sherman , a writer-builder and a frequent contributor to Fine Homebuilding , bought an 1840s Vermont farmhouse that had to be moved in order to save it . He and his artist wife , Maggie , did most of the reclamation work themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ' Let the house be itself , ' but we quickly found that compromises are sometimes necessary , " Sherman wrote in Fine Hon-rebuildMg , " We could n't afford to do a textbook-perfect restoration . What we could do is revive it , keeping its character , while blending it with the needs of a modern family . " ? ? ? Any restoration or basic revival project is going to involve hard work , often by owners as well as subcontractors . There is always frustration to be contended with , and it can take various forms ; any single rehab increment can  --  and most likely will  --  take longer than expected . Each stage of a project may also cost more than budgeted . Any old house can be full of surprises  --  so the would-be rescuer should be ready , both psychologically and information-wise . Quite often an element of physical danger must also be contended with . Old structures can conceal a host of problems : slippery roofs , plaster ceilings ready to fall , or dark basements full of sharp objects . Extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost any rehab project . Experts all preach the same sermon : get the most accurate idea possible of what the structure will need . And cost considerations should be coupled with aesthetic outlook . Any old house 's integrity should be kept in mind , within reason and budget . Veteran rehabbers emphasize this point for basic revivals on modest budgets as well as for 100 percent restorative heavyweights . Care is a key factor at every turn . In the assessment stage , professionals should be consulted to determine structural soundness , or lack thereof . " You should develop a sense of what needs to be done to the house , " advises Beth Facinelli , the co-owner of Restorations Unlimited , a contracting-consulting firm in Elizabethville , Pennsylvania . " Then get estimates . We can pretty much ballpark out to people , go through , and in a two-hour consultation , give a thumbnail sketch of what they can expect to spend . Then see if the family finances can swing it without it being a burden . " Most often , the intrepid homedelivery or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , even a lieutenant who happened to be there .

No , if ' t was important , Stanton  --  why , maybe I 'd try to outsmart you on it . But , of course , it ai n't . " He bent down and took his hat from the floor and started for the door . After a step or two he paused , and said half aloud , " Oh , me , oh , my !

I reminded myself several times of how lucky I was to have that sudden opportunity . But all the rest of that day I could not put from mind the recollection of the look which the President gave me , and the words he paused to speak more to himself than anyone else , just before he left us .

Vila of " This Old House " offers some valuable mental-health points : " I always advise people  --  if you 're going to be living in the mess  --  to try and save one area of sanity for yourselves , " he says . " Do one room , a parlor or something , where they can maintain a semblance of what is normal . Very often that means ' tenting ' the space with polyethylene .

Get at least three estimates , because some contractors will bid very high if they do n't really want to get the project . ? Ask for , and talk to , previous clients , and ask for photos of recent completions . ? Agreements should be in writing , and the local Better Business Bureau should be contacted . ? Never pay for a project completely up-front . ? For small projects , any quality contractor should agree to a 33 percent " split " ? one-third down , an installment at mid-project , and the last upon completion or inspection . ? Before signing a contract , be certain whether the agreement includes total cleanup . " For large projects , the best method is a system of ' draws , ' " explains John Rick , the owner of Wood Logic , an Atlanta contracting firm with years of rehab and restorations to its credit .

Ask your doctor about predonating blood or about autologous intraoperative transfusion . We applaud her courage in trying to prevent others from suffering her fate . She removed tissue to blot her eyes while telling her tragic story ? its impact moved some in the audience to tears . " She reminded me of my grandmother , " one said . Mrs. Polikoff has three grandchildren . Her story as she presented it to the AIDS commission : " My name is Dorothy Pollkoff . My husband , William Polikoff , was a World War II veteran . He survived the Bataan Death March and was a POW for 31/2 years , but he did not survive AIDS . He died December 9 , 1987 . His death was unnecessary , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my infection with the AIDS virus could have been avoided . " I am 63 years old and was infected with the AIDS virus from my husband , who died several months ago from the complications of transfusion-related AIDS . He was transfused in 1984 during cardiac bypass surgery while under the care of the Veterans Administration Hospital in San Diego . His surgery was performed under their auspices at University Hospital in San Diego , where he received three units of blood . At that time , University Hospital had available the equipment to perform intraoperative transfusion , but it was not used for my husband . If this technique had been applied , he would not have needed to receive someone else 's blood , and neither of us would have become infected . " Unfortunately , none of our doctors ever mentioned that there were alternatives to homologous transfusion . The possibility of AIDS infection was never discussed . " My husband never fully recovered from that surgery , and at that time neither of us understood why . He was hospitalized on various occasions since then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was diagnosed as having hepatitis B. Bill was tested two days later and was told he was a carrier . I spent the rest of that year fighting for my survival , still unaware that both of us were infected with the AIDS virus . " A few months after my release from the hospital , after reading articles about AIDS being transmitted by blood transfusions , both Bill and I asked our doctors if we could be tested for AIDS . They told us that there was no need to worry or that it was not necessary , but neither of us was completely reassured . " One day , we passed by a health fair that was distributing condoms and information about AIDS at the VA Hospital . They advised us to go to the county health department to be tested for the AIDS antibodies , which we did on March 12 , 1987 . In the meantime , Bill had developed a tender lump under his arm and had gone to the VA emergency room , where he was treated with antibiotics .

We brought the slips to our doctor and told him the results . We were both upset . I was almost hysterical . I could n't believe what I was hearing , and Bill was furious . " Not only had the doctors at the VA hospital refused to test us for the AIDS infection when we requested it , but
