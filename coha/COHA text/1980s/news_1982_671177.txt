" She would talk about how wise and clever he was , " Dr. Wallach says . " I began to get jealous , not because I thought she was going to have an affair , because I knew he was a high-grade analyst , but because I wished she would occasionally see some of those features in me. " // Dr. Wallach ' s candid comments illustrate some important facts . It is not only psychologically difficult to go through intensive psychotherapy , but it can also be very difficult for the patient ' s spouse , or for other close family members or friends. // Although these difficulties are widely acknowledged among therapists , often nothing is done to prepare the spouse for the marital and family problems that intensive psychotherapy can bring. // " The poor spouse just doesn ' t know what ' s going on , " says Steven M. Sonnenberg , head of the Washington School of Psychiatry . Women ' s magazines occasionally feature articles with such titles as " Psychoanalysis Broke Up My Marriage , " and some practitioners have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of psychoanalysis and the other intensive psychotherapeutic techniques it spawned. // " Freud noticed that people who entered analysis sometimes ended up in divorce , and he was very disturbed about that , " says Maria T. Lymberis , a psychoanalyst in Santa Monica , Calif. // Many of today ' s therapists contend that more marriages survive through therapy than are ended in it and that the marriages that do end were shaky when therapy began. // While the problems faced by the spouse of the person in therapy can be seen most clearly in psychoanalysis , experts say they are similar to those faced by people in less intensive therapies. // Professional and ethical considerations often prevent therapists from efforts on behalf of spouses or marital concord . Many psychoanalysts and other psychoanalytically oriented therapists see their obligation as due exclusively to the patient , in helping him to understand and deal with his unconscious conflicts through analysis of free associations and dreams . Analysts often believe they must not " contaminate " this long and difficult process by talking to the spouse or other relatives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly and to dig out and examine his most painful thoughts and memories unless he has complete trust that they will never be repeated by the analyst. // The patient may enter analysis to deal with personal problems and , perhaps , because he believes analysis will be a great adventure in self-discovery . But analysis can take several years , with four or five sessions each week , and the patient soon finds that it involves a lot of hard slogging . " Analysis is not a superficial experience , " says Ralph Gardener , a Pittsburgh psychoanalyst . " It really can shake your roots. " // " It was because of these difficulties , " Dr. Sonnenberg says , " that the early analysts told their patients not to make any major decisions in their lives , not to get married or divorced , for instance . But this has become impractical as analyses have become much longer. " // The patient can often become withdrawn , depressed or preoccupied or can lash out with at the spouse or other family member . The spouse , often not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame , can not help wondering if the changes in mood are caused by his or her own actions . The future of the marriage can be thrown into doubt. // Relations in the family may be further complicated , psychoanalysts say , when the patient reaches a stage they call tranference , in which the patient transfers to the therapist feelings associated with important figures in his past . While this transference may be hostile , it is also often affectionate . <> <> Feelings Can Be Threatening // The spouse may begin to wonder about the intense and seemingly inappropriate feelings the patient has about the therapist , and these can seem especially threatening if the patient and analyst are of different sexes . If the patient is a woman , a male therapist " can take on some of the attributes of an idealized husband , " says Nathan Hurvitz , a Los Angeles psychologist. // " I think the husband who has a wife in analysis has to learn to share his wife - to learn that she has other loves , " says Dr. Harvey Rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves her analyst , but that is a love in fantasy , not in fact. " // Many spouses are deeply troubled to discover that with the addition of the therapist another important person has joined the marriage , a person the spouse may have never even met . Intimate thoughts that were once discussed with the spouse may now be reserved for the therapist. // " The result is that the relationship between spouses may grow more distant and cold , and meaningful communication between them may reach an all-time low , " wrote Paul H. Glasser , a psychologist , in the journal Family Process. // What initially most troubled Nancy Scott , a Pittsburgh medical technologist , about her husband ' s psychoanalysis was " the fact that you have no privacy . " " A third person is present in the bedroom and the house , and that ' s very threatening , " she said . " You feel angry that you can ' t get your two cents in when you are being discussed. " // Professional therapists also readily admit such concerns . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says one Northeastern psychoanalyst . " I felt that this guy knew all the idiosyncracies of my life , that he had been there in bed with me and my wife . " <> <> A Third Person in Decisions // Intensive therapy can affect many other parts of the marriage . " It puts your personal life on hold , " says Mrs. Scott . " If there ' s a decision - buying a house , having a child - you know that a third person is privy to everything , and you feel that it ' s two against one . It takes a lot out of you. " // When only one spouse is in therapy , there are often fights about the inroads of therapy into family time , and about the amount of money it takes . A complete psychoanalysis could cost $15 , 000 annually for three or more years . Since psychoanalysts usually require patients to pay for missed sessions , the patient may have to make his own vacation match his analyst ' s. // The spouse may react by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient to withdraw from therapy or by trying to sabotage the process . Or , the spouse may do what Mrs. Scott and many others do . " I struck back , " she told a meeting of husbands and wives of candidates in analytic training . " I had the perfect revenge . I would get myself an ally - someone to be on my side and to make my husband angry as he had made me angry . I went into analysis. " // According to Elizabeth Thorne , a New York psychoanalyst and psychologist , " The spouse typically becomes a patient ; it ' s very rare that only one spouse is in treatment. " // While such a course can lay a dreadful financial burden on an ordinary family , many therapists see this as the best solution . " If both are in treatment , it avoids the disastrous labeling of one spouse saying , ' But you ' re the sick one , ' " says Dr. Rich. // Another advantage of treatment for both husband and wife is that it can avoid a pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the untreated spouse gets worse as some of the relationships in the marriage are changed . <> <> Long-Term Benefits Also Seen // While experts readily concede the problems of having a spouse in therapy , many who have been involved in therapy say there have been numerous long-term benefits to the spouse and to the marriage . Norman B. Levy , a psychiatry professor at the New York Medical College at Valhalla , studied a questionnaire given to 414 spouses . Writing in the magazine Resident and Staff Physician , Dr. Levy reported that 63 percent found the analysis helpful to the marriage and 19 percent found it harmful . As for the full experience of analytic training , including analysis , 23 percent of the spouses reported that it increased sexual pleasure , while 16 percent found that it decreased such pleasure. // Other family members are also affected . Parents , especially parents of young adults , can be troubled by having their children in psychotherapy . According to Dr. Martin V. Hart , a psychiatrist in Rockland County , N.Y. , parents may ask , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it takes five years four times a week to correct it ? " // While family problems caused by therapy may be inevitable , experts say there are ways to minimize them . Zira De Fries , a New York psychoanalyst , cautions patients not to become too preoccupied with themselves and not to engage in a lot of psychoanalytic interpretation at home . " It can be very inappropriate ; sometimes a cigar is just a cigar , " she says. // In addition , many therapists urge the patient to strive to keep relations as normal as possible . Saying " ' I don ' t want to discuss it until I talk to my analyst ' just doesn ' t help the marital relationship , " says Dr. Ronald E. Fox , dean of the School of Professional Psychology at Wright State University in Ohio. // As for the spouse , Dr. De Fries advises , " Be very tolerant and understanding . Sometimes patients will communicate and sometimes they will be reticent. " // Others say that the spouse should not feel the analyst is siding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own analysis , Mrs. Scott found that " it ' s quite an eye-opener to learn that your analyst is not there as an ally against anyone and not there to join your anger against your spouse. " // Some experts argue that therapists themselves , even when their professional convictions prohibit them from seeing the spouse , could take the spouse more into account in and could avoid mystification about the whole therapeutic process . Psychoanalytic institutes , for instance , could prepare printed information or provide names of people who could help the spouse understand some of the travails of therapy. // Experts caution therapists to help the patient understand the spouse ' s position and not to take sides in marital disputes . Dr. Rich says , " It ' s the duty of the analyst to respect the tremendous burden that analysis places on marriage. " //
