But that question raises two others : What was Walls - Dallas ' s rookie left cornerback - doing making the Cowboys to begin with , and , following that , earning a place on the starting team ? // Walls made the team last summer as a free agent from Grambling State ; even though the heralded Cowboy scouting staff did extensive research on him , the team saw fit not to draft him. // The 21-year-old Walls is a 6-foot-1-inch , 190-pounder with a pleasant , boyish face . But on the field , he is kind of funny looking . " I ' ve got size-11 feet and I ' ve got a duck walk and knock-knees , " he said . " And when I run , it looks like I ' m going in a lot of directions at once . It ' s not a very pretty sight. " // " Besides that , " said Gil Brandt , the Cowboys ' head of scouting , " he wasn ' t a burner . " Which means he was not as fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on to intercept 11 passes this season and became the first rookie to lead the N.F.L. in that category since Lem Barney in 1967. // Several of Walls ' s interceptions came at important points and helped to save games - and , it follows , the Cowboys ' season . The Cowboys finished the regular season with 12 victories and four losses , sharing the second-best record in the National Football League with Cincinnati. // " In every season , " said Coach Tom Landry of the Cowboys , " there are a few games that make a major difference . You win those , you ' re in good shape . Lose them , and it ' s wait till next year. " // One of those games for Dallas was against Miami . There were two minutes left in the final quarter and Miami was losing , 28-27 , but the Dolphins were driving for a touchdown . Miami was in Cowboy territory . The Miami quarterback , David Woodley , threw a sideline pass , but Walls , darting in , picked it off , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the clock to preserve the victory. // The game ' s hero , though , couldn ' t have begun the season less impressively . As a free agent , Walls was not one of the 332 college players picked by the 28 teams in the N.F.L. Of course , the Cowboys were not alone in passing him by . But the Cowboy brain trust should have been most chagrined . For one thing , Walls was born , raised and still lives , as he says , " just three minutes ' drive , including the red light , " from the Cowboys ' practice field on Forest Lane in north Dallas. // " When I was younger , " said Walls , " I ' d hang around the field and watch the Cowboys . I dreamed about being on the other side of the fence one day. " // The Cowboys also seemed blameworthy because they scouted Walls . And when the Cowboys scout a player , they have a reputation for doing it with uncanny precision. // Their methods have been so successful , that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Cowboy teams have compiled 16 straight winning seasons ; that includes making the playoffs in 15 of those 16 seasons . They have also been to five Super Bowls , another record , and won two . The Cowboy organization is so famous for detail that last summer , the United States Army even sent a contingent to the Cowboys ' training site . The brass wanted to learn how the Cowboys do things. // The Cowboys have become known as " America ' s Team " because of their nationwide popularity . Their ratings on network television , for example , are invariably the highest in football . But they might also be known as " America ' s Computer Team. " // Before the Cowboys , most teams would send an old-timer with a stopwatch to check on a prospect . The Cowboys , however , initiated the kind of sophisticated electronic techniques into scouting that made them seem more like I.B.M. than N.F.L. // Walls had drawn the attention of some scouts because of his reputation as a fine defensive back in the Southwestern Athletic Conference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , composed of predominantly black colleges , had been declining in the eyes of many scouts . Once , the league provided a steady stream of great pros like Willie Davis of Grambling and Walter Payton of Jackson State . But since more colleges from the South were recruiting the so-called " blue-chip " black players , the pro scouts were not showing up as often at the black colleges. // The Cowboys , though , generally leave few details to chance . And so two Dallas scouts went to Grambling for a about a week to test Walls and a few other Grambling prospects. // " It was the weirdest thing , " Walls remembers . " The first thing , they put me on a mat and when they said ' jump , ' I jumped . Then lights and buzzers went off . This was some kind of reflex timing device . I thought I was being electrocuted. " // A few more unusual testing devices were used . " Much later , " said Walls , " they finally got around to the stopwatches . " Apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Walls a high draft choice . Or even a low draft choice . " I ' m just not a computer player , I guess , " said Walls. // The Cowboys combine the tests they administer with interviews with the prospects and their coaches , plus extensive viewing of game films . On a scale of 1 to 9 , the players are rated on personality characteristics such as character , competitiveness and mental alertness. // Defensive backs are rated on eight physical specifics : ability versus the pass , overall ability versus the run , ability to diagnose plays , pursuit , tackling , hands , acceleration , and catch-up speed ( chasing a touchdown-bound ball carrier ) . // Then they compare these traits with others of his peers , plus those whose histories in pro ball are known . Throw all this into the stew and mix well . " We came up with 186 players that we wanted to draft from all of the major and small colleges around the country - and Everson wasn ' t one of them , " said Gil Brandt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development and the head of scouting. // " The biggest thing going against him was his speed , " said Brandt . " We timed him at 4. 7 for 40 yards . We like to have cornerbacks who can do 4. 4. // " But a lot of people can run 4. 4 . What it essential for a cornerback is that he has what we call ' closing speed . ' That is , that he can gather himself when he sees a pass going in another direction and get over there to stop it . Everson has now shown he has that unique ability , but we weren ' t sure he did when we scouted him . We had some reservations about his competition. " // Walls didn ' t . " I played against some great receivers , and some great passers , " he said . One of those passers was Doug Williams , now the Tampa Bay quarterback , who was a senior at Grambling when Walls was a freshman . " We became friends and Doug taught me a lot . I proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s all that mattered . I didn ' t care what scouts thought or what the computer said . I had confidence . I guess I bucked the system . But when I went to the Cowboys ' training camp , I felt I could make the team . And the more I played , the surer I got. " // In camp , the Cowboys also had three rookie cornerbacks they had drafted ; two were cut and one , Ron Fellows , now plays behind Walls . The Cowboys , to their credit , encouraged Walls . In fact , even though they didn ' t draft him , they were knocking at his door at Grambling shortly after the draft , hoping to sign him to a free agent contract . Buffalo and St. Louis scouts were there , too. // " I was disappointed in not being drafted , sure , " said Walls , " but I was half expecting it . The pros just didn ' t seem to be drafting many from our conference anymore. " // He graduated with a degree in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wanted to give pro ball a shot , and so he signed with the Cowboys . " I had to , " he said . " My whole family and all my friends are naturally Cowboy fans . I don ' t think anyone would have talked to me anymore if I had signed with any other team. " // The Cowboys were also planning to give Walls a good look in training camp. // The Cowboys are aware that mistakes can be made with assorted computers . Inputs and interfaces are only as good as their humanoid feedings . And , as is widely known , no humanoid is perfect. // The Cowboys have had the most spectacular success with computers , making expected choices - the nearly can ' t-miss big-college stars like Lee Roy Jordan , Bob Lilly and Tony Dorsett - but also making surprising draft choices that worked out gloriously . They chose a basketball player once , named Cornell Green , and he became a great player . They picked players from obscure colleges , such as Jethro Pugh , from Elizabeth City State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they became great players. // In 1969 they picked Calvin Hill from Yale as their No. 1 draft choice . Yale was no college football powerhouse . But the computer said Hill was choice beef . And he was. // Three years later , Bill Thomas of Boston College came up with the same computer credentials as Hill . And Thomas was plucked first in the 1972 draft . He flopped. // " What went wrong ? " Gil Brandt said . " Who knows . We ' ve tried to check back and figure out our mistakes , but it ' s hard . Meanwhile , we learn that we aren ' t infallible. " // The Cowboys have also been home to some of the most unconventional of football players , such as Duane Thomas , who didn ' t like to talk to people and who didn ' t like to prctice , and Hollywood Henderson , who talked to everybody and didn ' t like to practice . When they were bad , they were very bad , but when they were good , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they performed. // " We give everyone who comes to our camp a real chance , " said Landry . " As a result , historically we have more rookies making our team and more free agents than anyone else. " // Some of the Cowboys ' most famous free agents were Cliff Harris and Drew Pearson . This year nine rookies made the Cowboys , and four of the rookies were free agents . Of the 45 men on the Cowboy roster , 10 are free agents , including such important plaers as Pearson , Anthony Dickerson , Benny Barnes , Rafael Septien and Michael Downs , who , like Walls , is a defensive back a rookie and a Dallas native. // This open attitude began even before the Cowboys discovered computers . In 1960 the Cowboys began as an expansion team , were allowed to select few quality players from other teams . They had to pick and choose as wisely and liberally as possible. // " We had to do everything we could in the beginning , " said Landry . " Nothing was out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not computers. " // The Cowboys were 0-11-1 in their first season . But five years later , they were contenders , and have been ever since . Patience , Landry learned from the beginning , is incalcuably essential . " The owner maintained confidence in me , " Landry said . In fact Clint Murchison , the Cowboy owner , then signed Landry to a 10-year contract . " I knew he ' d get the job down , " Murchison had said. // Landry brings that kind of patience to the football field . And Everson Walls is a case in point . To begin with , it was fortunate that Walls happened to live so close to the Cowboys ' practice site in Dallas . He showed up earlier than most players , and hapened to catch the eye of the coaches , particularly the defensive backfield coach , Gene Stallings. // If Walls had come in with the mass of players , Brandt acknowledges , he might have got lost in the shuffle . " Everson was getting burned a lot in the practice and in preseason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a lot of outstanding plays . It was about 50-50 . But he was showing improvement all the time. " // In the first four regualr-season games , Walls , playing second string , blew a number of plays , but he also intercepted four passes and led the league in that department. // Landry said , " I wondered how much better he might play if he was in there full time . " He continued to make mistakes - such as gambling on an interception against San Francisco , and missing , and having a 78-yard touchdown result for the 49ers. // Against Miami , Woodley took advantage of his inexperience on several occasions , but Walls made adjustments that worked at the end of the game. // " The turning point in the season for me , " said Walls , " was the 49er game , when I was getting burned all over the place . I kept looking over my shoulder for Landry to take me out . But he never did . And it gave me a good feeling , that he had confidence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me - and he rarely talks much to players - and said , ' You learned something out there today . ' And I did. " // But the Cowboys , in the case of Everson Walls , were also learning something - or having something they already knew confirmed : the best-laid plans of computers and printouts sometimes go awry. //
