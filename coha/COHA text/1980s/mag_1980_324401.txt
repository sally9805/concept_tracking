The unions and the party embark on a delicate experiment <P> To the cheers of hundreds of sympathizers gathered below the five-story concrete building , two workers proudly hoisted a new red-and-white banner that proclaimed , INDEPENDENT AND SELF-GOVERNING TRADE UNION OF GDANSK . Inside , the wood-paneled hall buzzed with excitement . A young organizer from a tractor factory near Warsaw boastfully announced that 50% to 80% of the workers in his sector had signed up for the new unions . A burly miner from the Silesian coal fields , on the other hand , complained of official harassment against efforts to organize his mine . The familiar figure of Lech Walesa , 37 , the triumphant leader of the original Lenin Shipyard strike , rose to make a telling disclosure . During a recent trip to Warsaw , he recounted , the authorities had in effect tried to buy him off by offering him the leadership of the party-controlled official trade union-a lure he had duly refused . Pledged Walesa to a rising cheer : " We can not lose touch with the workers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement taking root in hostile ground . The gathering in Gdansk last week was the first nationwide meeting of some 150 organizers , representing new independent unions throughout the country , come together to stretch their new muscle and air their concerns . The convention-like meeting , in fact , was only one sign of the seething activity that was continuing to take place in Poland after two months of labor turmoil . " The Poland of today is not the same as before July 1980 , " conceded a top government official . " It will be impossible to return to the situation we had before . " <P> For one thing , the strikes had not entirely dissipated . A lingering ripple of scattered stoppages continued at more than a dozen enterprises last week ; some smaller factories experienced their second and third walkouts . Moreover , in Berlin , in what some observers interpreted as a spillover from the Polish upheaval , several hundred West German employees of the East German-run railroad* went on strike to press a series of demands : higher wages , new fringe benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The long shadow of the Soviet Union still loomed over Poland . Indeed , the Pentagon reported signs of ominous Soviet military activity on Poland 's borders . The moves involved 20 Soviet divisions in East Germany and 20 in western Soviet military districts . Washington analysts were unsure whether this might be in preparation for an eventual intervention , but Secretary of State Edmund Muskie said the U.S. was closely monitoring the situation . President Carter delivered a promise and a careful warning : " We will not interfere in Poland 's affairs-and we expect that others will similarly respect the right of the Polish nation to resolve its problems on its own .
