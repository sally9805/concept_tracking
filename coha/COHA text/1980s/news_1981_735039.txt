txt A federal judge found the air striking air traffic controllrs union in contempt of court for violating a back-towork ruling and ordered the union to pay a $250,000 fine if the controllers are n't on the iob by S n.m . EDT today . Earlier in the day , President Reagan bluntly warned the controllers that they would be fired if the illegal walkout , which began yesterday at 7 a.m. , does n't end by 11 a.m. tomorrow . Federal officials said they will seek additional civil and criminal penalties that could total millions of dollars . The government also won a court order freezing the controllers ' strike fund , sought to decertify the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization as the controllers ' bargaining agent and asked that the union 's leaders be jailed . The strike , by more than 70% of the nation 's 17,000 controllers , disrupted air traffic across the country , forcing the cancellation of many commercial flights and causing lengthy delays in many of the remaining flights , according to the Federal Aviation Administration . But government officials said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike weakens as FAA officials expect . J. Lynn Helms , chief of the FAA , said that by midday yesterday , about 29% of all controllers had reported to work . More are expected to return today , he said , which may allow 75% to 80% of commercial flights to proceed . The FAA is using supervisory personnel to help guide flights , Mr. Helms said , and about 400 military air controllers will be available today as backups . The fine imposed by Judge Harold Greene will increase over three days , rising to $1 million a day if the controllers still are striking at 8 p.m . Thursday . In addition , union President Robert Poll , also found in contempt , will be fined $1,000 a day unless he tells his members to return to work tonight . Mr. Poli told reporters outside the courthouse that the strike will continue . Asked if the union can afford such stiff fines , the union leader said : " We 're going to have to see . " A union attorney estimated the labor group 's total assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected the government 's request that Mr. Poli and 10 other union leaders be jailed for violating the back-to-work order . The judge said he wanted to give the officials time to think over their course of action and " purge themselves " of contempt . Mr. Greene scheduled an additional hearing next Monday to consider whether any further action needs to be taken . The air traffic controllers walked off their jobs just hours after talks broke off between Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis and the union president . Mr. Poli rejected the government 's early-morning offer of a $50 million-a-year package . A union spokeswoman yesterday termed the government 's final offer " an insult " because it did n't address the controllers " main areas of concern . " The union wants a $575 million-a-year contract providing a 32-hour workweek , more liberal early-retirement provisions and a $10,000 across-the-board raise . The pay raise would boost the top salaries to $59,000 a year from $46,700 . The controllers insist they deserve the concessions they seek because of their hectic , stressful work conditions . New talks have n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The President has ordered Mr. Lewis to refuse to resume negotiations while the controllers remain on strike . Yesterday , Mr. Reagan termed the union 's demand " unacceptable " and declared that the strikers " are violating the law . You ca n't sit and negotiate with a union that is in violation of the law . " The President said the controllers " will be terminated " if they do n't return to work tomorrow . However , strikers would receive one-week notices and could appeal their firing , according to Transportation Department officials . A federal judge at 4 a.m. yesterday issued an order prohibiting the strike and barred the union from using its $3.7 million strike contingency fund . The government has won at least 33 similar temporary restraining orders , according to a Justice Department attorney . A department spokesman said such a large number of court orders was required because the roughly 495 union locals fall within the jurisdiction of different federal courts . The Transportation Department said it plans to seek $100,000-aday penalties against each of the locals . The Justice Department announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders or members of the union for alleged violations of statutes that prohibit federal workers from striking . The charges are expected to be filed in 11 cities , a department spokesman said . Earlier , the department said it had begun investigating possible criminal violations by the union members in 19 cities around the nation . The criminal complaints ask federal judges to issue summonses to appear in court for hearings within 24 hours . At that time , the charges would be read , bonds set and pleas might be accepted . The department said its investigations are continuing and left open the possibility that more charges would be filed . A federal employe who goes out on strike can be subject to a criminal fine of as much as $1,000 and jailed for as long as a year and a day . If any strikers ignore the summonses , " they 'll be arrested , " a Justice Department spokesman said . President Reagan Sunday told Secretary Lewis " there 'd be no amnesty " for the strikers . In addition , the Federal Labor Relations Authority charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it decertified , a process likely to take three weeks . The FAA then would n't be under any obligation to bargain with PATCO , said Stephen Gordon , general counsel for the FLRA , which handles labor disputes in federal agencies . Last night , Judge Greene granted an FLRA request for a special back-to-work order . The order is nearly identical to the one issued earlier in the day for the Justice Department , but separate actions were required because of different statutes involved with each agency 's charges . Theoretically , the judge could issue additional fines against the union for violating the second court order . The Reagan administration clearly hopes the decertification threat might be the tactic that ends the strike . " I have a feeling we could drop the decertification move as a bargaining chip , as a sort of face saver , " said one White House official . " Poli could decide that , rather than end the union , ' we better go back to work , ' " the official added . But officials of the controllers ' union said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In good conscience , I wo n't allow my members to go back to work , " Mr. Poli declared at a news conference . He said controllers understood the possible penalties of an illegal walkout before yesterday 's early morning strike vote . About 13,000 controllers endorsed the strike . " The only thing we 're asking for is survival in the work place , " Mr. Poli said , adding that he believes the President " has n't been properly informed about the problems that exist . " The chances for negotiations resuming soon do n't look bright . " If you give in to a sort of hostage situation , it sets a precedent , " the White House official said . " They 're holding the airlines , the air travelers and the government hostage , and you send out an enormous signal to the world " by bargaining during a strike . Transportation Secretary Lewis said that even if strikers returned to work and talks resumed , " we do n't plan to increase our offer . " He termed the government 's latest offer " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35% of the 14,000 normally scheduled commercial flights to be canceled yesterday , the FAA said . Delays in most of the remaining domestic flights ranged up to an hour and 15 minutes in busy airports during the early part of the day , according to FAA Chief Helms . But by late afternoon domestic delays were averaging about 20 minutes , he said . However , some international flights from Europe were delayed for as long as 4% hours , he said . Late in the afternoon , the FAA lifted restrictions that had canceled 50% of general aviation flights . Negotiations had resumed last week after the controllers overwhelmingly rejected an initial $40 million-a-year package that Mr. Poli agreed to just hours before a June 22 strike deadline . Mr. Poli had accepted that package because he lacked support for a walkout . Under the contract the union rejected last week , the Reagan administration would have pressed for legislation giving each controller an immediate average annual pay raise of 6% , or about $2,000.               @ @ @ @ @ @
