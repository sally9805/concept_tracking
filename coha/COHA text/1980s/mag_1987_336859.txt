" How 'm I doin ' ? " he used to shout , cocksure that the crowds would reply on cue with the adulation he felt he deserved . Ed Koch was more than merely the mayor of New York City ; he was the embodiment of the shining Big Apple : volatile and voluble , fast with a quip or a put-down , an ebullient practitioner of dukes-up chutzpah who liked to march at the head of every parade . <P> Koch rarely asks that question anymore . Midway through the third term he won in 1985 with a 76% landslide , the mayor appears battered and snappish as he struggles to maintain his uncertain hold on a turbulent and troubled city . Like Ronald Reagan , Koch is a master showman who finds that he can no longer dazzle his audience . His woes are such that when he was asked to lead a delegation this month to observe progress toward peace in Nicaragua , it offered a pleasant change from New York City . <P> Until recently New York was a showpiece of urban success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the brink of bankruptcy in the mid- 1970s to new heights of prosperity . The jobs created during his ten years as mayor led to a record 3.6 million workers in the city . Manhattan reasserted itself as the dazzling hub of finance and the arts . Even Pope John Paul II gee-whizzed that New York was the " capital of the world . " <P> So what if critics complained that the city was increasingly crowded , dirty , overbuilt and unworkable ? Koch could ignore them  --  until two years ago , when disclosures of widespread corruption revealed that his administration was beset by the same complacency and cronyism that the mayor had denounced in his predecessors . Other problems festered . Black residents grew outraged at the New York City police , accusing them of the unwarranted shooting of blacks , including a 66-year-old woman killed as she was being evicted from her apartment . When three blacks were brutally assaulted by a gang of whites in Howard Beach , Queens , last December , the case became a symbol of New York 's mounting racial troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all . The stock market collapsed , threatening to turn the city 's golden economy to dross . Koch 's miracle recovery had been built on the financial and business-service industries . Samuel Ehrenhalt , regional commissioner of labor statistics , puts the number of new jobs in the Koch era at 400,000 . Openings on Wall Street more than doubled , while New York 's traditional manufacturing base was allowed to fade . Now if Wall Street has caught cold , the city may come down with pneumonia . Economist Matthew Drennan of New York University 's Graduate School of Public Administration projects that without a market turnaround , 28,000 jobs will be lost in the securities industry and 7,000 in banking , wiping out an equal number , 35,000 , in restaurants , retailing , real estate , hotels and support services . <P> Koch reacted instantly to the crash by freezing the planned hiring of 5,200 new workers and postponing raises for 4,000 management jobs . As a result of his reassuring actions , the city 's bond rating was upgraded last week to its highest level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , head of the Municipal Assistance Corporation , which oversees the city 's finances , praised the belt tightening as a " good first step , " but warned that " New York faces the potential of a very difficult period .
