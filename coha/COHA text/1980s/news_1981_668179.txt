PISCATAWAY , N.J. - Larry Bird scored 29 points and the Celtics bounced back from a 10-point deficit in the last five minutes last night to overtake New Jersey , 117-115 , the Nets ' 12th straight loss . The win was the fourth straight for the Celtics and the 16th in their last 17 , while the Nets now have dropped all 11 games since Bob MacKinnon took over as coach on Dec. 22 . The Nets led , 109-99 , with 4:52 left , but with Robert Parish scoring seven of the Celtics ' next 15 points , Boston took a 114-111 lead with 49 seconds left .

Lowes Moore ' s two foul shots with seven seconds left brought the Nets to within one again , but Nate Archibald closed out the scoring with a foul shot with one second left .

The Nets ' leading scorer was Cliff Robinson , who notched a season-high 30 points . - There is only so much coaches can do . Consider how the Celtics got themselves into overtime against the Bulls on Friday night , eventually emerging with a 117-111 triumph over Chicago .

Now listen to Bill Fitch , talking about how the play had begun with Robert Parish pulling down a defensive rebound with six seconds to go . " If , " Fitch said last night , " Robert had taken one second longer to get the ball out to Tiny , we would have called time out . " Instead of a fast-break layup , therefore , the Celtics would have had a shot produced by an out-of- bounds play from midcourt . . . Anything can happen on one of those . Q.

The Nets have only won three games since Nov. 30 , those triumphs coming on Dec. 2 ( at Portland ) , Dec. 5 ( at Phoenix ) and against Milwaukee ( Dec. 17 ) .
