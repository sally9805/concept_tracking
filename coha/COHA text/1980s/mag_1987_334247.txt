As chairman of J. Walter Thompson , the fifth largest advertising agency in the U.S. , Joseph O'Donnell was one of Madison Avenue 's golden boys . During his ten years at the agency , he had raced ever upward through the ranks . At the start of the year O'Donnell at 44 had defeated several rivals to become the chief at Thompson and the heir apparent to Don Johnston , the 59-year-old chairman of the J.W.T. Group , the holding company ( estimated 1986 sales : $650 million ) that owns the ad agency . Further triumphs seemed assured . <P> No more . Just three weeks after his promotion , O'Donnell was suddenly missing from Thompson offices last week . He had been abruptly fired after presenting a plan to take the company private and oust Johnston as boss , according to members of the J.W.T. board of directors . The directors , who decided that O'Donnell 's behavior was grossly inappropriate , deliberated for about an hour before giving Johnston the go-ahead to sack him . <P> The aborted palace coup and the wunderkind 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 122-year-old agency that has been troubled by poor profits . Wrote Chairman Johnston in a memo distributed to all employees : " Nothing in my 36 years with this company has so saddened me . " <P> The drama began when O'Donnell came to Johnston , his mentor , with a proposal to take the company private through a leveraged buy-out : a financial transaction in which investors , often company insiders , use borrowed funds to gain control of a firm . Johnston listened politely to O'Donnell but made no response . For the next few days the two men communicated only through intermediaries , until Johnston called the company 's outside directors to an unscheduled meeting to hear what O'Donnell had to say . <P> Summoned before the board , O'Donnell told the members that he had been approached by representatives of the Claremont Group , a New York City-based investment-banking firm , to discuss a leveraged buy-out . O'Donnell presumably was inclined to consider such a transaction , since it would probably have given him and his fellow managers a more significant ownership stake in the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should have been consulted before any powwows took place with investment bankers . <P> The next bombshell , according to two directors , came when O'Donnell proposed firing Johnston and installing himself in the top spot . Director David Yunich , retired vice chairman of R.H. Macy , says that O'Donnell 's 1 1/2- hour presentation was " incoherent . " At one point , Yunich reports , O'Donnell volunteered that he had been " kicked out of " Columbia Business School and thus had a weak grasp of finance . Says Yunich : " We could n't figure out whether this person had flipped his lid or not . " O'Donnell says he was merely passing on Claremont 's unsolicited buy-out proposal and had thus done nothing wrong . <P> The management shake-up comes at a particularly difficult time for Thompson . Like all other agencies , it has recently been buffeted by a spate of mergers that has intensified competition in an already brutal business . But Thompson faces special problems . While the agency is admired for its creative flair , Thompson 's pretax profit margins are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One likely reason for the poor performance : Thompson has been slow to cut costs and lay off workers .
