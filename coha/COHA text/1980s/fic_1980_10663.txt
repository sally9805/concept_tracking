Paul Ivory walked in espadrilles on the paths and passagesof Peverel , the sound inaugurated , softly , the modern era . As did his cotton jerseys  --  some blue , some black  --  and trousers of pale poplin . The modern era , like the weather , was making these possible . Paul had brought the sun , and his luck , with him . Early on warm mornings , the girls pressed flowered dresses in a room by the kitchen where an ironing-table was covered by a worn blanket and there was an old stone sink . Ted Tice 's fair-isle pullover and sea-green cardigan in cable stitch had been put away , perhaps forever . Mrs. Charmian Thrale told Paul Ivory , " I recall you as a perfect child . The only child ever to captivate my father . " It was her way of saying , What a charming and indeed blessed young person ; and of sketching , most delicately , her own desolate childhood . Paul took praise well , unembarrassed , diffidently pleased . It was not usual at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of youth and taking justified pleasure in his own health and good looks . In his early and deserved distinction , he made the future seem less formless . Paul 's play would be produced in London in the autumn . In preparation he received telephone calls and registered envelopes . There were mornings when he must not be interrupted , because of adding or rewriting . The play was called Friend of Caesar , and had been announced in the press as presenting a contemporary family as an analogy of political power . Paul himself read this out with a smile . A celebrated actor had agreed to play the leading role . Paul Ivory was a man of promise in a literal sense : circumstancesp71had made a solemn undertaking to see Paul prosper . His play would be widely and justly praised . Provincial towns and foreign cities would clamour for it , and a famous director would make a successful film . The radiant pre-eminence of Paul 's engagement with events was far more bridal than his prospective betrothal to Tertia Drage . In its subtlety and confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique . As some fine portrait might be underpainted dark where it showed light , or light where dark , so might Paul Ivory be subliminally cold where warm , warm where cold  --  the tones overlapping to create , ingeniously , a strong yet fluid delineation . Similarly , his limbs might seem the instruments or weapons of grace rather than its simple evidence . Paul 's attenuatedfingers turned up at their tips with extreme sensitivity , as if testing a surface for heat . Sefton Thrale told Ted Tice , " Paul will make his mark . " Like praising a pretty girl to a plain one . And yet there was the sense that Paul Ivory and Ted Tice were both marked men , and symbolically opposed . It was not merely that the world had set the two of them at odds . More irrationally , it seemed that one of them must lose if the other were to win . Sefton Thrale had twice remarked that Tice would soon be gone , and was mindful of the actual date . Mrs. Thrale told Paul Ivory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impediment of speech and had once been a Communist , but had never , like the man at Thaxted , hung the Red Flag in the church . The Professor put in , " He is High , of course , very High , " as if a clergyman were a piece of hung game ; recommending attention to the church facade as a fine example of napped flints . And on the Sunday Paul went to church in the village , involving the household at Peverel in a religious gesture . The two sisters , ironing blouses , watched the red car drive away . Charmian Thrale might be noting the event from an upstairs room . Paul cast his spell , as Ted his pall . It was undeniably affecting , the thought of this tall , victorious male kneeling down , offering and receiving . Although both Mrs. Thrale at the high window and Caro in the kitchen were aware that women are not to be trusted with emotion of the kind.  |p72Carrying  the folded clothes into the hallway , Caro found Ted at the open door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers . " She did not know whose part to take but , like Sefton Thrale , recalled that Ted would soon be gone . She put the fresh blouses in a basket on the stairs and went with Ted into the garden . He said , " In two weeks I 'll be gone . " " You 'll be in Edinburgh . And , soon after , in Paris . " Making clear he had nothing to complain of . She herself , in a month , would go to London to work in the government office . For Caro had come out of the examination ahead of all the rest ; being a marked person in her own way , which was not theirs . There was the brief , silent imagining of new life , even to the deal tables and scarred office chairs . Ted said , " I must imagine it without you . " They walked out of the flower-garden and stood under trees , looking on the valley . An entire nation lay still with Sunday and summer . A yellow field , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint . From distant uplands , reaped stubble pricked the eye , reliable as old tweed . On the opposite rise , a chess-piece on the chequered board , Tertia 's castle notched the sky with grey crenellations . Ted said , " I 've no charm at the best of times , and nothing is less charming than unwanted love . But as we 're parting soon I must say it , that I hope you 'll think of me and let me write to you . And eventually let me love you . " The girl heard his speech out with a stoicism that made her seem the sufferer : withstanding his appeal like necessary pain , treating it with careful respect . " Of course I think of you , and will write . I like you better than anyone I 've known . " She moved away  --  a blue dress passing like haze over a backdrop of dark trees and painted fields . " As to the rest , I ca n't see how it would ever happen . " " From my point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a few words , he was squandering the asset of silence . It was inconceivablethat he could not touch or take hold of her light-blue body that had power over all his days . The very outline of the earth , beyond her , was nothing to it . " You 're as distant from me now as you 'll be when we 're separated . There 's no happiness in this for me , our standing together here and now . But I 'll think of it , later , as being close to you , and lucky . "  |p73She  had clasped her arm about a tree and stood looking at him . It seemed the very landscape gloated , and that the tree allied itself with her  --  impersonal , established . Or that she leaned on the tree seductively , to taunt him . The hallucination vanished , but left knowledge of a kind . There was a heavy smell of vegetation steamingin the sun : England drying out . " Ted , " she said . " Ted . " Mild exasperation . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my own for the first time . It matters to me to be at liberty now , after years of Dora . " It was a reason , certainly ; if not the truest reason . Ted had heard of Dora . " Once people establish themselves as a cause for concern , they do n't give up easily . " Then he feared she might refer these words to himself . " On your side there 's the anxiety , on hers the claim to it . That often passes for affection , even for great love . The very fact that you did well in that test "  --  he meant the examination where Caro had come out ahead  --  ' ' confirmsyour ability to accept her burden : you have a certificate now to prove it . " " I do n't tell her a thing of that sort . It seems to recoil . " Caroline Bell having discovered in childhood that achievements can be transformedto hostile weapons . ( " Everything falls in your lap , why should you care about a life like mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or tell , and the need to hoard silent strength had long since been resolved . She said , " I 'm not sure I can explain that . " He said , " I know exactly . " ( When Ted Tice was eleven or so , his mother told him , " It was when I went to Lacey 's , after leaving the mill , and worked on the invoices . It was your uncle Tony Mott got me the chance there , seeing I was a dab at the sums . Yes , it was your uncle Tony give me my chance . Well , come Christmas Mr. Dan Lacey handed other lasses at office two pound apiece in an envelope as a present . But I got three , along of being quick at the figgers . I 'd never seen the like of two pound let alone three , me wages were twelve bob a week , took off me by my dad soon as I was in the door . An I knew well enough he 'd take this off me too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got home that night I heard right off that my cousin Lorna  --  tha never saw our Lorne , that was Cec 's only girl and died of the lungs , very month tha was born  --  well , that Lorna had gotp74three pound , or three guineas it was , where she worked , though two was usual . An I was pulled both ways , I was put to it , you see , whether to show I was worth the three like Lorna or to say two and keep one to missel . An I did , I kept one back and did n't let on . It was the one time I was fly . " Ted 's mother was sifting flour at the time , on a big kitchen slab that was their only table . ) Under the laden trees Ted Tice tilted back his head and saw the sky . This might have had to do with salt tears and the law of gravity . " ' T was your uncle Tony give me my chance . " Ah Christ : My chance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lorna favvered her dad . She 's in the family group , ' t was taken just round that time , but tha ca n't make her out that clear , she 's at back and got her head down , poor Lorne . " ) Ted Tice looked at the horizon . He remembered Uncle Tony , short and pink , who lived a little better than the rest of them , knew a chap on the council , and kept a tiger cat called Moggie . He said , " Paul Ivory is marrying that castle . " " I suppose so . " They both stared out at the solid , sunlit figment of history 's imagination , on its dated elevation . As a spouse it inspired some apprehension . Ted said , " Paul Ivory has to marry a lord or , at very least , the daughter of one . It is written . Written likewise that she be rich . He has no choice , it 's mandatory . Turn right for the castle . " " Even so , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnatural to say " Tertia " where no intimacy could exist . " Maybe she feels beleaguered in the castle . " They smiled to imagine Tertia on the battlements , peering glassily from behind machicolations . " Or there is an antagonism she enjoys . Or they know the worst about each other . That can be a bond . " " Paul might change . He is still young . " " His faults are n't those of youth . He has no growth , merely automatic transmission . " The girl had not heard Ted Tice on this note before  --  savage as his inferiors , with a malice that blurred his virtue . Disappointment was perhaps for his sake , that he should join in the general unmasking . She moved out from the shadow of trees and started hack to the house . They had not disagreed . But some carefulness wouldp75now develop on both sides  --  a concern not to offend or expose . It was unclear why this had come into existence . To Ted Tice , the defeat appeared to be of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him and he had bungled it . An image  --  of her strong will expressed in apparent passivity , while he urged an absolute need  --  baffled his intelligence with sheer waste . Otherwisehe might have seen in it a virtual representation of the act of love . In these warm days Tertia came and went , taking Paul Ivory here and there . Grace and Caro saw her sit at the wheel of her green car , her eyebrows raised , her pupils insensate as the bronze discs applied as eyes to ancient statues . Grace said , " I suppose she is a great prize . " She had read this phrase , which was her way of declaring : They can not be in love . There came an interlude of calm brilliance when it was morning all day long . On one of these clear days Caro , returning from the village , met Paul Ivory , who was on foot . Seen this way , out of bounds , he was like a rider unhorsed ; and she said this to him . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost , to see Paul laugh and make his graceful stride . Paul Ivory was a star : any firmament would do . He had seen Caro from a distance and altered his course to intersect . Had observed , as he drew near , that her walk turned the progress of other women to a thump or shuffle . He would have said her delicate dark strength was virile  --  a sombre glow that might distinguish some young man . He remembered dark , vigorous young men who kept somewhat to themselves , yet retained this vibrancy of adventure . Then he thought how such youths often ended feebly , how quickly they grew sour or cautious , or became the foils of bitter women  --  their energies turned to blame or bluster , their pride morose . He had already seen that ; and supposed that in the case of women such beings dwindled entirely , or at most passed some shred of their lost impetus to children . Paul Ivory had also noted penalties of impulse . Had seen how men provide themselves , before their taste or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and condemned thereafter to the fixtures of an outgrown fancy . He was satisfied his own prospectivemarriage would preclude such dangers . An accusation ofp76dispassion would not have troubled him . He was not convinced that passion was essential , or that the world had properly defined it . The girl asked , " Shall we take the shortcut through the church-yard ? " " No graveyard can be a shortcut . " Paul opened a wicket gate . A torn kite was lying in the grass . Caro said , " There are often children playing here . " " Children like cemeteries . No traffic , no live grown-ups , and the headstones are child-height , companionable . " Caro , who usually came that way , showed the inscriptions . Here lieth all that could die of Oliver Wade . The earthly enchantments of Tryphena Cope are here subdued . On later stones , merely the name , and the years  --  of birth and death  --  connected by a little etched hyphen representing life . Eroded tablets tilted like torn kites . On the oldest the lettering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The dead in cemeteries give the impression of having all died normally and peacefully . " Paul did not reply , but she persisted , " Do you think that 's why they excluded suicides from consecrated ground , to maintain the fiction ? " As they passed on in silence to the road it occurred to her that , since he was a believer , she had possibly offended . Paul 's expression smoothly allowed her to think so . There was something cold in him that might wait to be given a chance . Paul wished perhaps to punish her  --  for her being remarkable now , and for any impending ordinariness . All that was remarkable , if you boiled it down , was that she gave belief of a kind . You might not accept it but she gave it  --  being a believer in her own way , which was not his . He said , " You emanate so much resolve , and all of it unfocused . " " I do n't think you know me well enough to say that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , when I know you better ? " Passers-by looked harder than was necessary , for these two madea couple whose fates could not be predicted with confidence . Havingthe world regard them as a pair made a fact of it . " They 're surprised to see you with someone at your side , " Paul said . " You 're so much alone . " They had reached a turn where the castle confronted them across summer meadows . Everything else appeared to waver in the heat , but not the castle . " I see you alonep77in the garden at night . I look down and see you there alone . " In the transparent morning he created a moment of night silence : Caro unaware in the garden , and Paul watching . From his hidden elevation he created fragrant darkness round them both . " To me it seems I 'm not enough alone . " " Is that intended for now ?  --  For me ? " " Of course not . " The castle was obdurate , the only detail not executed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the least breath of air . " Women have capacity for solitude , but do n't want it . Men want and need it , but the flesh soon makes fools of them . " It was Paul Ivory 's habit to suppose that girls knew more than they let on . Taking the castle for her model , Caro would not be disconcerted . They were on the hillside path , near the place where she had sat in the dark with Ted Tice and talked of loyalty . Although no treachery was involved , she would not have wanted Ted to see her pausing there with Paul Ivory . Although she walked on in her straight way , inwardly she stooped and was vulnerable . Paul halted by the low wall , as if he knew of her scruples and meant to flout them . " Do you send him about his business too ? " He brushed the wall lightly with his hand , and sat there . " You know I mean Tice . " Caro sat beside him . Her soul seemed a cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its contours exposed and scarcely natural . It was hard to say which was unworthy of the other . She observed Paul Ivory 's appearance as if it were an event that might develop before one 's eyes . He had the face of the future , skilled in perceiving what the world wants . When he said , " You know I mean , " there was a clouding of his looks with something coarse that made her its accomplice . It was no more than she deeply expected of him , yet his tapping of that vein of expectation made complicity between them . When he said , " You know I mean Tice , " she understood , also , that Ted 's love was a stimulus to Paul and the cause of their sitting together on the wall . The man was turned towards her , awaiting some kind of victory . He would have her believe that any or all suspicion was warranted and confirmed . She was certain he was about to touch her  --  touch her breast or shoulder , put his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purifying intensity . At the same time she was fixed , subjected , fatalistic . And sat , fingers clasped , no sign of agitation , with the immemorial stillness of women at such moments . Paul stood up and thrust his hands in his pockets . " Shall we go on , then ? " Paul stood ; while Caro looked up recomposing her flesh and blood . And Paul smiled , having had his victory . Caro entered the house alone , and stood in the hall . There was a mirror on one wall , and she had lately taken to watching herself . Even when looking at a plain wall these days she might be picturing herself , if not with accuracy . Now her likeness was dark with the change from sunlight to shadow , or because her vision dimmed from momentary faintness . At a distance a door opened , and ProfessorSefton Thrale called , " Charmian ? " And Caroline Bell could not know why that simple fact should bring her close to tears . It was a state of mind . Or it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , a little girl of six years old , and looked in a long mirror cool as water . And , a door opening , had heard her father 's voice call " Marian ? "  --  which was her mother 's name . That was all there was in it , that was the evocation : a small spasm of memory that could never elucidate itself.  |p79Paul  Ivory had been accepted by Tertia Drage . When this was known , the Thrales gave a dinner for the lord of the castle , inviting also a pair of neighbours known to have sufficient property in Kenya . The large locked drawing-room at Peverel was aired and reclaimed by help hired from the village . The opening of the room for such a purpose did not so much terminate its period of closing as make clear it was now a shrine . Longer than broad , the room had Corinthian pilasters and a pale fireplace at each end . Windows went from floor to ceiling , draped with orange silk brought long ago from Swatow by a relationin Butterfield and Swire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might be drawn to conceal panes in need of reglazing . Two chandeliers had been carefully cleaned ; but a third , in a basket in the attic , was a hailstorm of dismantledcrystals . By daylight , patches of damp made an atlas of the walls . Ted Tice , who was handy at such things , repaired an extra leaf belonging to an oval table . The panel , which had warped while out of use in the war , was laid on trestles , where Ted could work at it ; and the village help , unconvinced of his standing in the house , despised Ted for his proficiency . There was an elderly hired couple who supervised  --  the husband tall but with distorted stance , as if he had once been seized and wrung ; the wife buttressed by flesh and corset , an emplacement withstandingattack . This pair , the Mullions , were now retired from long service in some mighty house ; but were glad , as they said , to give satisfaction from time to time . Service and satisfaction , theirp80strong preoccupations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Mullion , in black , told Ted Tice : " The young do not understand the meaning of service . " Because she had heard him sing " Southerly , southerly " in the drawing-room , yet did not believe he was a guest . Mrs. Mullion also disliked and feared Ted 's accent , or rather the absence of any attempt on his part to flaunt or disguise it . It was plain , however , that this hired couple went in awe of Paul Ivory , who neither sang nor repaired furniture and scarcely greeted them . Ted was at the final stage of his repair of the table , which involveda touch of varnish and the fitting of a small brass hook . When Mrs. Mullion spoke of the meaning of service , he was workingnear an open window and might not have heard . ( Once  --  it was when Ted was ten and had his tonsils taken out , which was done at home  --  his mother had sat down on his bed and told him about the service and the satisfaction . " Thi fathersaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor would he . We did it that one time , when we was first married and went as couple to the Truscotts at Ponderhurst . Being afeard of not finding work , and thi father still with the cough then from gettinggassed in the war . Truscotts brought cook and maid with them when they come down , and driver , but were wanting a couple to look to the place when they were up in town whilst Parlyment was sitting . Well , pay was n't much but there was keep as well , and the work not heavy . " We 'd been there six weeks it must have been when Mr. Truscott  --  Sir Eric as he is now  --  come to thi father and said as we were giving satisfaction and should look to stay on . But seeing we were a couple newly wed he should make clear that he and Mrs. T. , wanting their quiet in the country , preferred we have no children . I was n't there when he said it , but thi father called out to me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Say it again '  --  like that , right out , so you could see what was coming . ' Tell ' er , ' he says . Well then your father gave it him good and proper . ' We 're leaving here today , ' he says  --  us that had n't penny to our name nor mortal place to lay our head . And Truscott says , all red and fit to brast , ' You 'll go without the reference then . ' And thi father says , ' Myp81reference from thee is , I would n't stand thi bloody lip . What 's it o ' yourn if we 'd a ruck o ' kids , or none ? ' And then he says what he should n't about Truscott and Mrs. T.  --  she was n't a bad sort really , only gormless . Well , Truscott made to walk off , but thi father told him , ' I 'm going to newspapers with this and they can print it , how a minister o ' the crown talks to an Englishman these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this sheet and says , Tice , I 'm sure we can settle this peaceable , ' or peaceably . He 'd the wind up right and proper . ' Let 's sit down and talk sensible , I may not have explained missel . And have been lately under a strain . ' Him that ne'er did hand 's turn except to blether . Well , upshot was he give us fifty pound and we left next morning . We could live six month then , at a pinch , on fifty pound and keep oursel decent . There was the reference too , They have given every satisfaction . But thi dad said , Never again . " A bit later on he told it all to Mr. Beardsley , yon parson at Southport who stuck up for the working folk , and the idea was he might still go to papers with it for it riled him yet . But Mr. Beardsleytold him No , because we 'd took the fifty pound . So that was an end of it . And now Truscott 's Sir Eric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) As to the hired couple at Peverel , the Mullions , Ted Tice learned afterwards that they had lost their grandson in an accident some weeks before . If you knew enough , antipathy would rarely be conclusive . Caroline Bell took out a dark dress , bought abroad , which alone of her clothes created the effect that might in some future time , or very soon , be entirely hers . She hung the dress up in her room , where she could see it , like bunting for a festival . She had scarcely worn it , and liked to think how she had bought it with a pile of pastel-coloured banknotes on her last morning in France . Dora had subsequently gone to pieces over the price . When the time came she took the dress down from its hook , and it slipped into her arms like a victim . She had drawn back her heavy hair and coiled it ; and could see , in the mirror , how this became her . Caro went downstairs in the early evening wearing her dark dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was ironing thep82belt in the room near the kitchen when Tertia came in carrying a mass of flowers . " These must go in deep water . " Tertia laid the flowers on a slab by the stone sink . She had a rustling , sweeping dress of silver . It was as if a salt gale had blown in ; yet Tertia was only standing still and watching Caro iron , while the flowers lay on their cenotaph ready to die . Caro set the iron on its rest and held up the belt  --  her head back , her arm raised , and the belt suspended . Being human , she could not help herself . She knew she had sometimes left her mark , but on this occasion had a taste to see the fact acknowledged . " And what , " Tertia asked at last , " are you going to put on tonight ? " Caro continued to hold up the belt  --  to one side , like an abstractedsnake-charmer , so she could look Tertia in the face . It was a pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her beautiful dress , her throat and arm bare , her delicate raised hand , and her dark eyes fixed on their object . In this way for some moments she compelled Tertia Drage to admire . And from the garden Paul Ivory called , " Caro . " It was the first time he had spoken her name . There was a pause , in which sounds could be heard from the adjacent kitchen . Releasing Tertia from the spell , Caro lowered the belt and fitted it with slow care about her own waist . She then carried a heavy vase to the sink and turned the tap . These modest actions commanded attention , and Tertia was not the first to see in Caro 's most commonplace movements rehearsals for life and death . When the flowers were in the vase Caro looked again at Tertia and said , " In deep water . " And laughed , and dried her hands and walked away . That evening they were celebrating Tertia 's betrothal to Paul Ivory . Sefton Thrale showed the view over the valley in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened drawing-roomwas not quite willing to harbour life : a neglected room can no more be rallied for an emergency than an overgrown garden . It went without saying that there were bowls of roses , soft lamplight and , in each grate , a small fire burning . However , as the entering voices rang , the room retreated . It was an old room ,  |p83un|practised  in raw new sounds of struck matches and the ice in tumblers . It appeared that Tertia 's mother was a survivor of the Titanic  --  eclipsing Grace and Caro with their obscure , inglorious Benbow and its ineffectual displacement of Australian waters . Tertia 's mother remembered being lowered to a lifeboat in her seventh year , and saved . Surviving to become a brawny chestnut mare , she had conceivedand borne five daughters but no male heir . There was the glacial flow of Tertia 's moire on the carpet as she sailed away from her mother , a pinnace from the flagship . How much time had been taken to prepare that evening 's versionof Tertia Drage  --  the sleek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleaming necklace and little pointed shoes ; the enamel matching on her fingertips and concealed toes . Yet Tertia was indifferent , scornful , as if decked out in these trinkets and gauzes quite against her inclination . You might nearly believe in her neutrality , against all the evidence . Tertia had dissociatedherself from human weakness : when she touched her dress with near-derision , mere life in others was made to seem commotion . Yet she had begun the evening with a sharp defeat . Tertia 's mother said , " She spoils every dinner party she attends . " Fond and proud . Crushing a billowing blue sofa , Lady Drage now became a creature too heavy for its element , a cormorant on the waves . An extra guest she had brought took his place on the hearth , where flakes of fire sprang up behind him . A tall , reddish man about forty , he cleared his throat with assurance but spoke little . He had a signet ring , old gold , smooth as a knuckle ; and wore a Brigade of Guards tie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formality with which such evenings must now be opened . Caro asked Ted Tice , " Do English people always speak of money ? " " Mainly the rich ones . " Mr. Collins from Kenya , seated in a leather chair , knew a joke about Australia , or Orstrylia ; which he said was from the recent war , giving the setting as Tobruk , but which in fact went back to the Great War and the campaign in the Dardanelles . The story was as follows : A wounded soldier asks an Australian nurse at his bed/side , " Was I brought here to die ? " and " No , " she answers , " yes-terdie . " That was the joke . Caroline and Grace Bell were familiar with this story , which was often told to them when they were introduced . Ted Tice had not heard it before . It could be seen that tears came to his scratched eye as they did to the other , flawless one . Mrs. Charmian Thrale gently touched a collar of pearls . Whiter than pearl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( In 1916 , during the Battle of the Somme , Charmian Playfair , volunteering as a nurse 's aide , was assigned to ambulance duty at Victoria Station where casualties were arriving on hospital trains . The loaded ambulance trundled back through dark streets carrying its racks of blanketed men  --  who , from their spotless newspaper anonymity of " the wounded , " were suddenly incarnate as moaning , silent , or plucky inhabitants of rent , individual flesh . Enclosed with these spectres in swaying gloom , a nineteen-year-old girl put her hand to her soft throat . Yet moved as best she could , to supply water or answer questions , among the grey blankets and the red , rusty , or blackened bandages . There was a boy of her own age to whose whisper she had to bend , her face nearly touching his : " So cold . Cold . My feet are so cold . " And , almost capably , the girl answered , " I 'll fix that " ; turning to adjust the blanket , and discoveringhe had no feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ritual rather than confusion : the simultaneous preoccupation of girls with love and dresses , the men with their assertions great and small , the women all submission or dominion ; an imbalance of hope and memory , a savage tangle of history . These welling together in a flow of time that only some godlike grammar  --  some unknown , aoristic tense  --  might describe and reconcile . Mrs. Thrale shifted roses to make room for an ashtray . Her back did not touch the sofa . Tertia 's chestnut mere was saying , " Not Kenya , no never alas , but we of course were in Egypt when my husband was  --  oh picturesque I grant you , who can deny , Luxor , Karnak , but the beggars and what can one do . Nobody is more tender-hearted actually  --  to a fault my family always tell me  --  but it would not be a kindness , indeed dangerous to . Is n't that so , Guy ? " Her husband mechanically gave his endorsement . 1 le sat be/tween the women , a panel that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become the views he had never contested : perjured acquiescence registered in an inward shrivelling of lip and chin . Yet he suddenly said , starting from sleep , " In Egypt she suffered from the sun . " And did look about , if not intently . " Pigmentation , that 's the word . Parents had no sense , forced her outdoors as a girl , did a lot of harm . " The remonstrance an echo of a time when he had imagined that his wife , of all people , needed his protection . Yet , between the fire and the ice , she had survived . The dreaming dog , Grasper , twitched on the hearth , where the tall man in the Brigade tie stood impassive , lighting his cigarette . He had been introduced as Captain Cartledge . The young people had drifted to the other end of the room , where they were grouped together , all standing . Their elders smiled to see this  --  someone at least was having a good time ; which , it was hoped , would counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , in Paul , one desirable young man . Caroline Bell did not quite look young , bearing her new beauty like a difference of generation . It was churlish of Ted Tice simply to stand there . It had somehow been agreed , on both sides , that he should not be one of them . " In my usual way , " said Tertia Drage , " I lost the car keys . " My usual way , she would say , or my inimitable way , just like me  --  to connote distinction , even fame . If Tertia did it , it must matter . Ted stood taciturn , the underdog ; and yet prevailed . While Tertia , topdog , had suffered a defeat this evening and might again do so . Ted had repaired the table in time , despite last-minute anxiety from Sefton Thrale about the hammering . Linen , silver , and flowers were deployed and candles placed , the table solemn as a dignitary lying in state . In its elaborate discretion , the table was their cue , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose you are a whizz at carpentry , that sort of thing . " " That 's right . " " Lucky you . Runs in families , I expect . " " As in the Holy Family . " This was Caro . And the man with the Brigade tie looked out from the elderly end of the room . Paul smiled . " Saint Caro , Protectress of Carpenters . " He was onp86her side , a side differentiated from Ted Tice 's , or even from his own . Ted perhaps chose to have no side that evening , preferring no one should join him . He was not even guilty of showing that he judged . They were ranged so that Paul and Tertia , betrothed , faced the others , but in the talk Paul would sometimes cross over to Caro . It could not be said this was brave , yet it involved a certain risk . Tertia now said , " All of you together in one house . " As if this were absurd of them . " Like castaways on an island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace remarked , " where a murder has been committed and all the genteel people are suspects . " It was agreed that Grace could never be a suspect . Ted Tice stood silent . Ruling Grace out made the rest of them appear more capable of violence . Grace was separate , not only in her mildness but in having fixed her affections . She had been claimed , and appeared as one of them for a last time and incompletely . For Grace , there had already been public avowals and secret disclosures , and the letters from Ottawa beginning Dearest . In someone 's view , she had attainedexcellence . These conditions might now have equally applied to Tertia  --  yet did not , although no marriage could seem more inevitable than hers . It was notable that Tertia never laid public claim to Paul by touching or by the other proprietary little exhibitions through which lovers show themselves complacent or insecure . On this night of their betrothal , Tertia forbore to link herself in any way with Paul and , standing at his side , conveyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeter outline of her body . There was something in it of the disdain she showed for her carefully chosen clothes . Paul now said to Caro , " Where did you get that dress ? "  --  bluntly , and , it would seem , not praising . It was then that Captain Cartledge joined them  --  making clear , by brusquely leaving the hearth and crossing the room , that he had been waiting the chance . Joined Caro , in fact , since he said at once , " Yes , the dress is beautiful "  --  exposing , by his compliment , Paul 's withheld praise . A horseman , Captain Cartledge had ridden over to the castle from a friend 's house nearby , not expecting to stay . Hence , he remarked , the wrong clothes , the tie . He had the complexion , lightly webbed , of outdoor living and indoor drinking , and was a high , handsome man who might have been cruel . Therep87was boldness , or purity of a kind , in his walking up to Caro with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feints and begrudgings with its single stroke of experience , making even Paul Ivory appear unformed . Tertia in her silver cataphract could not be pleased . Nor could Ted Tice , though it would have taken more than the aversion to bind them . Tertia exchanged with Cartledge the same cold recognitionshe offered Paul . And Ted Tice saw that these two had , perhaps that very day , been lovers . At the other end of the room the three old men discussed infirmities ; exchanging symptoms in undertones as boys might speak of lust . At table Captain Cartledge sat by Caro . Mahogany glowed like marble , the very flowers shone like glass or silver ; everything was something other than its lustrous self , and the table a catafalque no longer . It was inconceivable that a dark countryside lay draped outside the copper curtains . " You 've searched each other 's souls , then . " This was Captain Cartledge on the intimacy of young people in a house together . Caro said that soul-searching was at an end . Ted Tice would leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivory was to be some days in London , and , on that day also , Grace would choose , in Winchester , material for her wedding-dress . She pointed them out around the table like strangers ; while Tertia , opposite , cleaned her plate with her same disdain . " And you ? " As if the rest were immaterial . " I ? " Making known that she chose to be immaterial , too , to him . " I 'm going over to see Avebury Circle for a couple of days . " She said that Ted Tice had written out for her , for Thursday , the changes of trains . The Captain said , " The prehistoric monument , " while the table listened without knowing why . " It is prehistoric , " he repeated , as if this narrowed it down precisely . And , having done training on the Salisbury Plain , went on at once about Stonehenge . Suddenly , down the table , Paul Ivory spoke ; lifting his eyes to Caro 's and giving the slight , ironic smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The heathen ternpie , do you mean ? "  |p88And  Caro , unsmiling , both slow and instant in reply : " Yes . Older than the centuries ; older than the D'Urbervilles . " Going back in the car Tertia said , " That elder Bell girl has a neck like a man 's . " Tertia 's mother was thinking that the middle classes kept their silver far too clean.  |p89hen  Paul drove past the station and turned into the main road , Caro said nothing . Having gathered himself for an effort of persuasion , he took his time before addressing new circumstances . In these moments the girl 's stillness was such as to create , paradoxically , a bodily alteration . " You knew I was n't going to London ? " She nodded . " Was n't going to drop you off at your train ? " He would not haveexchanged for anything the suspense generated by her short nods . " And you knew why . When did you realize these things ? " " The night of the dinner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I am inexperienced . " " Something we must rectify . " He was creating an exchange he might have had with Tertia . Caro wondered if he did this to women , made them talk in such a way , in such a voice , with the double meanings that diminished meaning , stretching the tension-wire between man and woman to a taut , purposeless antagonism . His banter gave an unearthly feelingthat you were not hearing his true voice , and that it might not even exist . She said , " Do n't let 's speak like this . " " It 's how I talk . " " You might like a change . " His present object , surely , being just that . " You will never sound like Tertia , if that 's what you mean . " She waited , fearing his disloyalty , or his loyalty . Paul went on ,  | " Or look like her , either . You must have noticed Tertia 's eyes . " He brought the car nearly to a halt on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment took them further , as if serious discussion had occurredor some harm been done . He had not yet touched her , and the certainty he would do so gave speech a finality : the last words of their dispassionate selves . " When women have eyes like hers , it 's usually impossible to tell if they 're crying . " Paul might be accustomed to a likelihood of women 's tears . " In Tertia 's case , however , one may rest assured . " " You chose Tertia . " " I 'm not here to account for myself . " In this there was already the quick , overbearing petulance of the celebrated : Paul drawing on his future fame . However , he continued with no transition , " She was exactly the same at fifteen when I first set eyes on her , the most unphysical person I 'd ever seen . " " Is that an attraction ? " " Let 's leave Tertia out of it for the moment . " They turned at a signpost , leaving Tertia out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you still intend . " " Yes . I want to see it . " She wanted to see Avebury because Ted Tice had described it to her . She leaned her head to the air of the window , leaving Ted out of it . They drove over a surprising countryside like a delta or reclaimedshore , low and scarcely sloping beneath a sky of high massed cloud . Caro said , " For this moment it is not like England . More like the centre of America . " " I 'd like to live awhile in America , and use it the way their writers have used us . English writers ca n't manage American talk , they just write in their own prejudices . The English have a terrible ear for any speech except their own anyway , and as regards Americanswe 're all stone-deaf here  --  deaf , that is , to everything but the easiest awful tourist . That 's why an articulate American gets told in England that he does n't talk like an American : because he 's spoiling the game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching her than by making sense . And , since there were infinite possibilities to Paul Ivory 's utmost candour , could even have had this in mind . For Paul , sincerity was something to fall hack on when other methods flagged.  |p91He  said , " A lot of people in England pass their time collecting negative evidence on almost any theme . Old Thrale is archetypal . " It was more unexpected than his betrayal of Tertia , for Paul was throwing over not only the Professor 's adulation but his own winningways . It was also remarkable how this repudiation turned Sefton Thrale 's sycophancy to pathos . " What does it mean , then ? That you detest them all ? " She meant Tertia , Thrale . But he took it to be the nation  --  or preferred it so , the public breach of faith being more presentable than a private one . " I loathe the undernourishment of this country , the grievance , the censoriousness , the reluctance to try anything else . The going through to the bitter end with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loathing at that moment than Caro 's expressed love ; yet those were their prevailing passions . The car kept its even pace , a swift capsule giving form to their energies . Paul said , " You know my father was a prisoner of war in a Japanese camp . " Assuming Caro 's awareness of this fact , Paul Ivory was quite forgetful of her own father 's death by drowning . " When he came back in 1945 he had a jar of beef extract with him , a three-ounce jar of Marmite with a rusted top and the label off , that he had gone into prison with and kept intact for four years . Prisonersdo preserve talismans , of course , but this might have saved a life for a few days , or kept a fugitive on the go for a week . Except that the idiot farce of preserving it  --  of withholding it , in fact  --  had counted for more . Well , that is England in all its bloodiness . " A child waved to them at a crossing . Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he produced this jar of Marmite with the rusted top . Plonked it down on the lunch-table and told us in his graveyard voice it had n't been touched in three years and soand-somany months of starvation in the camp , and had been with him at every meal . Not bombastic , of course , the off-handedness being part of the larger vacancy . It was one of those occasions you ca n't rise to because you do n't accept the rules . I could n't stand it  --  the devotion to Marmite , the reverential baffled silence round the table . And I told him , ' Then its hour has struck , for God knows we 're hungry enough here too . ' And I unscrewed the bloody thing and dug my spoon into it there and then , to desanctify the Marmite cult before it took hold of me too and embalmed me. "  |p92They  entered a lane where the heavy overhang of trees was a closing of curtains . Paul said , " Well , speak to me . Or is that a damned Marmite look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think your story brutal and Oedipal , if that gives me a Marmite look . " Summoning real courage for a heavy risk . " Why should you mock anybody 's endurance or their means of survival ? You , who 've never faced death or even danger ? " Paul lifted his hands from the wheel in a show of hopelessness . But when they drove out from the screen of trees he said , " I might add , it tasted foul . I 'm lucky to be alive . " And they laughed , and gladly forgot all about Paul 's father . When Paul Ivory 's father turned conscientious objector as a young officer in the trenches late in 1917 , he had already published a volume of verse that , according to its pale paper cover , astonished by a lyrical precocity  --  astonished , presumably , because at nineteen he was considered old enough to leave the world but not to have ideas about it . Following a court-martial , and two years of detention that included an enforced stay in a mental asylum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same lyric form and pastoral theme . And this was , in a public sense , his undoing . Lyricism had gone out with the war ; peace had brought in belligerence . That a doomed subaltern had celebrated , under fire , the glories of his native Derbyshire had been affecting and commendable ; that an adult survivor in civilian dress should stick , through extreme , violent , and controversial experiences , to the identical rambles and brambles was absurd . Rex Ivory was seen to have no sense of his era or his opportunities ; to be , even more obtusely , unaware of new movements in contemporary criticism . And his second book , like his several subsequent collections , was received with curt contempt . Shortly after this he married a well-to-do and bossy girl , producedtwo sons , and disappeared into Derbyshire , apparently forever  --  his name once in a while providing a condescending footnoteor obvious joke for writers on literary matters between the wars . Joining , or rejoining , the army in 1939  --  a paradox noted only by himself  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was captured by the conquering Japanese . In Singapore , shared his prison hut with a statistician , a lanky officer of the 18th Divisionp93with whom he also divided a daily task of digging graves for comradesfelled by malaria , dengue fever , dysentery , beriberi , gangrene , and the malnutrition of interminable rice . Clandestine radio kept the captives sporadically in touch with similar prisons throughout the East , and by this means the tall statistician , Ivory 's companion , compiled slow lists of surviving , missing , and dead  --  keeping the records in cipher and burying them nightly in the earth ; and training Rex Ivory as his accomplice . In the third year , the statistician dug a last and longer grave , and bequeathed his archive and its maintenance to Rex Ivory . In the fourth year , when a liberating British fleet reached Singapore , the records were conclusively disinterred , and the scarecrow of Captain Ivory , the sole person equipped to decode them , was ordered to take fast ship for Colombo . From a devastated dock at Singapore he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood to attention on deck . The coded rolls crooked in his starved and scrawny arm were the only coherent record of the death of a British army . Clothed and fed , Ivory was sent below to the paymaster . " Disbursement to be made solely on submission of previous pay-slip . " " I was taken prisoner in Johore at 1500 hours on the afternoon of 8 February 1942 and have been in Changi Camp until this morning . " ' The paymaster got up from his metal desk and opened a combinationlock on double doors . A bulkhead safe was seen to be entirely fitted with packets of banknotes in infinite coloured order , like bricks in a pastel facade . " Help yourself . " From Colombo , Rex Ivory was flown to England where , after reporting himself at the War Office as ordered , he arranged to take the late , and at that time only , train for Derbyshire . His family were by now aware of his resurrection . As if he were some normal returning tripper , he preferred not to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very small box of blanched chocolatesdisplayed in isolation in a case . The girl said , " The coupons . The coupons please . " She pronouncedit kewpongs , and was not a girl at all but a dour grey woman , for all the girls were gone to the war.  | " What coupons ? " She looked in his face . Her alarmed fingers crimped on the tiny box as she then more slowly stared . " Where the devil have you been ? " Ivory said , " I was in a Japanese prison . Three years and seven months . " " Lose me job I will . " She put the box into his hands . These undivulged incidents , of paymaster and chocolates , were the peaks of Rex Ivory 's return , although his story was soon one of the items of victory , for the newspapers took it up and he became " the poet Rex Ivory " in publications where an indefinite article had formerly done for him well , and rarely , enough . A Selected Poems went into print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more witticisms about ivory towers . He read that he had been correct in spurning the First World War , and prescient in endorsing the Second ; and he pondered the new idea that he had shown acumen . The BBC brought electrical equipment into the Dukeries in a van and a camera followed the well-known and prescient poet Rex Ivory as he walked away between flowering borders with a pair of Sealyhams borrowed from a neighbour . Despite his unrehearsed analogy between the British mental asylum and the Japanese camp , the interview was a success ; because , when people have made up their minds to admire , wild horses will not get them to admit boredom . Ivory 's wife was amazed , and greatly pleased . And was pleased to amaze the great , and right , people with a distinction hitherto unsuspected by them or by her . To take social advantage of the surprise , she bought a house in London shortly after the war , when prices were lower than they were ever to be again . And Rex Ivory remained in Derbyshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one thing . In his jungle prison Rex Ivory had , as before , composed poetry  --  which he memorized there , since any scrap of paper was conserved for the coded casualty lists . An eminentpublisher stood ready to sacrifice a portion of hoarded postwar paper to the awaited volume . None of this was unpredictable . What had not been expected was that the verses from the Malayan death camp , when transcribed , would be found to celebrate , exclusively and inexorably , the streams and hedgerows of Derbyshire . There were other heroes by then , and other manuscripts . Publicp95interest in Rex Ivory was waning , the paper shortage intensifying . At a top-level meeting held on a wet Saturday morning at the publishing house , it was felt that certain of the poems  --  in particular , one concerning a lapwing  --  invited critical derision . Availing themselves of an Act-of-God clause , the publishers withdrew from the contract . And The Half-Reap 'd Field appeared , like earlier volumes , under an obscure imprint at the author 's expense . Ivory 's two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right schools , singing the right hymns , and making the right turns . " Quite right , " Ivory said , when his wife recounted the directions taken during his years abroad . " Ah . Quite right . " There was no reason to think there could be irony in it . Gavin , his elder son , was going into merchant banking . Right again . The younger , Paul , was still at the university . Born at the right times , they had escaped war by inches . In his family , Rex Ivory was a bereaved person , having lost familiarity . They had no idea of making good the loss , but would do the right thing and keep him company  --  at first all togetherand later by turns  --  until he grew accustomed to his solitary condition . That much at least was due to him : he had earned it by his interesting and advantageous behaviour in the camp . Their best hope was that America would take him up . There had been an inquiry from Texas about his papers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition , he had been interrogated by a visiting professor named Wadding , who was on his way to Scotland to establish the identity of Wordsworth 's " SolitaryReaper " and the words of the song she sang . ( An essay on these researches was later published in a scholarly journal under the title , " Will No One Tell Me What She Sings ? " ) Ivory 's wife felt that this American interest , which had flagged , might be stimulated . Rex Ivory objected to nothing . Yet you could not feel he was passive . " Unless it is passive resistance , " Paul said to his mother . " Your father has never been communicative . " By the time Ivory put on the requisite weight and a civilian suit , the wife and sons had drifted upstream to town . Ivory had visits from a few old friends who had shared footnotes with him in the past along with the indefinite article . There was no petrol to be had , and one friend , who had testified on Ivory 's behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bicycle ; another rode up onp96horseback in the rain , wearing a velours beret . There was no heatingfuel either , and Ivory was always cold . Of this he did make mention . It was said  --  not of course alleging any fault  --  that his blood must have thinned in the jungle . There were times when his wife came close to saying , " Rex dear , we are all cold . " When his father was dying , Paul came from Oxford with three changes of trains . Lying mostly silent , suffering this or that to be done for him , watching with his mute blend of detachment and attention , Rex Ivory seemed much as usual ; as if dying had been long familiar to him . Paul sat at the bedside  --  for they were taking turns with him again  --  and knew he would never care enough to understand his father 's mystery . There was something there , but it did not engage the interest . If the putative American biographer one day explained it , it would be a defeat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an exasperating puzzle . " Never seen death yet , Dickie ? Now is your time to learn . " Paul had not heard his father say these words before , but knew them for quotation and not , as his mother supposed , a deathbed confusion of names . A line from a ballad by an imperial poet about an old adventurer who had seen life and was breathing his last in the presence of a milksop son . Paul could not accuse himself and was not even sure , despite circumstantial evidence , that his father had seen life : events had imposed themselves on Rex Ivory , and could scarcely be called adventures . There had always been the absence of initiative  --  even the pacifism in the trenches might , if examined , turn to abnegation and withdrawal . Effort , quietly huge , had been expended in renunciation , as if human existence were some monumental jar of Marmite . Thus the poet Rex Ivory , assessed by his younger son , shrivelled ; and , at no great age , pined away and died. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bloom of their youth , suddenly among the megaliths . Paul stopped the car . Caro unlatched her door and stared . Tremendous stones stood expressionlesson curved avenues of grass . England had yawned open to disclose some other land , of fundamentals . The little churchyard slabs  --  child-height , companionable  --  among which Caro and Paul had once sauntered became , by contrast with these huge and mighty forms , ephemeral leaflets promulgating a forgotten cause . Compared with this scene , all the rest of Creation appeared a flutter of petals and pebbles , a levity in which the most massive tree was insubstantial . The sweet village itself , through which the farthest monoliths were posted , suggested , with its few thatched and slated centuries , a frail masking of reality . Not that the dark boulders supplied , by their outlasting , any triumphant sense of durability in man 's intentions . There could be no winning or even mattering here . You would have to pit some larger reason than mere living against these rocks : it was your mortality , your very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( At an earlier season Ted Tice had said , of another landscape , " It took all your conviction , there , to believe you existed . " ) The ordered placing of sarsens was more inevitable than Nature : with Nature there is a chance , at least , of inadvertence . Gaps in the rows , where boulders had fallen and not been raised , seemed themselvesbalefully ordained , obscene as missing teeth in the smile of a tyrant . Some stones were rounded , some columnar . That was their natu/ral state , unhewn , untooled . Paul Ivory said , " Male and female created He them . Even these rocks . " The presence of Paul offered something like salvation , implying that the human propensity to love , which could never contradict Avebury Circle , might yet make it appear incomplete . Aware of this advantage , Paul awaited the moment when Caro 's silence would be transferred back , intensified , from the place to himself . He was calm , with controlled desire and with the curiosity that is itself an aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessed at each other 's essence , and her show of self-sufficiency had given her some small degree of power over him  --  power that could only be reversedby an act of possession . Preliminary uncertainty might be a stimulus , if the outcome was assured . Caro had a wonderful danger to her , too , that derived not only from the circumstances but also from her refusal to manipulate them . The danger and the attraction were the same . There was , in addition , her young , resilient body , strong arms and throat , and her aversion to physical contact . Beyond the pleasure of defying his own circumstances , Paul pursued a further impulse to violate CarolineBell 's pride or her integrity . She will not be so very different in the event , he supposed  --  with a mental shrug or swagger ineffectual even to himself . The thought was nothing more than a way of wounding . He knew she would turn back to him glad of human greeting : Paul Ivory would be a solace by contrast with the unearthly field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he repeated , " Look at me , " and with infinite naturalness drew her against him and kissed her throat and cheek , and her mouth . There was a shock of sympathy not quite open to mockery . Her body strained both towards his own , and away ; her breathing rippled in his arms , on his tongue . In these moments , if he chose , he might feel her change forever ; might verify a crisis in which women confide their strength to men , like trust  --  so readily , if not unconditionally . Beyond the girl 's tilted head , Paul Ivory could see two or three people moving among the boulders , and a dog leaping for a thrown stick . But the coloured scene was detained , suspended , unable to keep pace with their own dual rush of life.  |p99Caro  's canvas satchel slid out from the open door of the car and lay in a small hollow of grass . She felt it go with absurd finality , a prized possession slipping away on an open sea . Within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts agreed perfectly . Over and over , the distant dog leaped for the stick . In the shade of syringa , a man with a cap had set up a camp stool and easel and was selecting paints . These onlookers might think them any pair of lovers in a parked car . It had not occurred to Paul that Caro 's influence might increase with her submission . Or that she would remain intelligent . When she leaned her head back to look at him , he was aware of her judgment persevering like a pulse  --  even forming the most tender , if least magical , part of love . He put a hand to her face , his own fingers trembling with a small , convulsive evidence of unfeigned life . He said , " Beautiful "  --  having learned this new , quixotic word . He traced the outline of her mouth with his finger , and her lips smiled under his touch . He said , " Shall we walk a bit ? " They got out of the car . Caro retrieved her canvas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which they reunited . By the roadside , where grass was fine as moss , the earth interred chalk rubble , scraps of pottery , and human bones . Paul walked with his arm round Caro 's waist and now called her repeatedly by name : two syllables like prohibited , pent-up endearments . A notice hung on the back of the door : " The Management is not responsible for loss of valuables . " " So it 's no use blaming them , " Paul said . Over the washstand there was another notice , splashed and faded : " It is regretted that hot water can not be provided in the rooms . " A streak of late light clipped one cardboard corner . " How did you know such a place ? " She was looking up at flowered wallpaper and a moulding of undusted acanthus . Beneathher head the pillow protruded from its cover , striped and soiled . " Under quite different circumstances . " Caro remembered a deserted little bar downstairs , stale-smelling ; a row of filmed bottles , bleared tumblers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink , and larded  --  its centered egg blatant as a child 's picture of sunset . She said , " The scene of the crime . " " What are you saying ? " " I was thinking about Avebury . Though crime is irrelevant to Avebury . Everything human is insignificant there "  --  lifting back her hair , resettling her head on his arm  --  " even human sacrifice . " " Things are the same now as then , only overlaid with hypocrisy . " Certitude returned to Paul , and some scorn for a world in which he had , so easily , his way . The girl lay by his side , part of the general acquiescence . He stroked her heavy hair and said , " I have never suffered greatly . " For luck or exorcism she touched his hand to the maple veneer of the awful bedstead . " Then you still have something to fear . " " I mean , when there has been tragedy or risk , I have not felt enough . Whatever enough means . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you can reach fifty without a catastrophe , you 've won . You 've got away with it . Perhaps even now I 've had more good life than they can take from me . " By " you , " Paul meant himself . " They " were undefined . Caro said nothing . By now she would have given up her life for him , but repudiated his wish to be indemnified , by arithmetical advantages , against experience . " Got away with it , " he had said , as if life itself were a felony , a shiftiness exposed like stained ticking on a rented bed . As if , for all his authority , he were a fugitive . His father had perhaps renounced existence ; but had not given it the slip . She would have told him , " You ca n't have this without catastrophe , " but was silent out of fear of loss  --  reminded how nothing creates such untruth as the wish to please or to be spared something . Paul got up and dressed . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ether , in pain and swirled by slow impressions that would scarcely focus ; while the wakeful world , personified in Paul , went about its business . Suspension of will in this experience might almost have brought new innocence , had it not itself been so deeply willed . There was the offering and inflicting : a brief excuse for the limitless tenderness no man would otherwiseindulge . From ignorance she had gone , in one hour , to this superiority of common knowledge.  |p101When  Paul sat in a shabby chair to pull on his shoes , she at last rose and went to him , and knelt for his embrace . Paul drew her body between his knees . Pressure of sleeves and trousers on her bare skin urged on Caroline Bell another sensation , from infancy , when her father would lean over her cot to take up the scarcely clad child in hard omnipotent arms of serge or flannel that smelt of the city and the great world . A particular memory , inapposite , of her father in evening dress on his way to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbons as he bent to kiss his elder daughter . And she was the child reaching up to a smell of tobacco and cologne and the dark male friction of the coat , while medals dangled like coins of small denominations . The transformations of her twenty years were no more amazing or irreversible than the new change , within a single day , of solitary girl into a woman kneeling naked on a threadbare carpet at her lover 's feet . The embrace , the room , a bar of light on the ceiling , a vacant luggage-rack in a corner could have been part of seedy insignificance the world over ; or might hold the very source of meaning , like the kiss , or flagellation , in the silent background of a masterpiece . " Caro , " Paul said , " you 'll catch cold . " He was clothed and sat presiding , but could scarcely bear the renewed power it gave her , this kneeling at his feet . " You 'll catch cold , my dear . " The pale sun had gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gimcrack . Paul pushed back her tangled hair to discover the white skin at the margin where summer had not reached . " Maiden no more . " Tears had formed at the corners of her eyes , but were not of the kind that fall or need be noticed . A stained mug had held cocoa , there was a browning scrap of apple on a saucer , there were heavy , unaligned shoes on the floor , a shirt on a chair . The room 's dark curtains and stern fixtures were not livened by mere litter and the smell of food . The books hardly helped , having nothing to do with the room : books of passage . It was a phase of Ted Tice 's work that interested him less than what had gone before and was soon to come , and the books knew it . He was uncharacteristically cold here , and lay on the bed dressed and wearing socks . At night he had a heavy quilt . It was a joke to the family : " But it 's a fine September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ted and Margaret had done this joke to death , as people do who hesitate to move on to the next phase . The family were all out to Sunday tea , except Margaret , who stayed in to paint or to practise the piano . Margaret must practise . Or might be avoiding some Donald or Willie  --  for Margaret , fair and stately , was the natural quarry of her father 's students . Or had some reason , greater than her many accomplishments , for remaining at home . The piano was in a downstairsroom at the back of the house , where she also painted . But in the Sunday suspension you heard all the notes , and even the hesitations of turned pages  --  of Schumann , Cesar Franck . Willies and Duncans would have turned music for her by the hour , or , if young men were not turning music these days , would have walked her through cold daylight streets to eat a brittle chop in the smoky din of a students ' hole . Any number of them hankered after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious to make some sort of showing for her sake . " She is a princess , " said her mother , who was a Fabian socialist . Ted Tice released the book he was supposed to read , and lay with one arm under his head , his other hand holding a letter . The book splayed awkwardly on the plaid blanket and , when he sighed , it sighed too and overbalanced to the floor . Below , the piano paused to inquire politely into the thud . The pause deepened . When the music was taken up again it was the music of songs as they might be played in a nightclub by a gifted pianist down on his , or her , luck . " Smoke Gets in Your Eyes , " and all the rest . I went to Avebury more or less as planned . It 's more a symbol than a place  --  an expression of the inevitable . You once said that life did n't have to be credible , or fair . And that seemed clear enough at Avebury Circle . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with a man called Leadbetter , and the job begins next month . I get four pounds a week  --  it would have been three but for passing the test . This Leadbetter was spruce , diminutive , in his celluloid cubicle . A sort of miniature model of a man , a ship in a bottle . Our talk was like that too  --  a whittled-down representation of human discourse . When I questionedone of the conditions , Leadbetter told me I was a perfectionist , as if that meant sinner.  |p103In  the evening I went to Richard the Second . In front of us was a mountain of a man  --  the least movement and he blotted out half the English court . " These Foolish Things " was followed by " My Romance . " The songs were being played with too much style and attention . No longer a pleasant diversion , it was more like a lavishing , the utter waste of something inestimable . I try to imagine you in your northern limbo waiting to leave for France . Ted , do n't lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe in as I do in yours , and no one else whose ambition ever seemed so clear a form of good . " In front of us . " Ted Tice was so sure , and so wished to be unconvinced , of the other presence in that phrase that he lost the capacity to judge  --  like a man who stares too long at a distant shape and can not be sure if it moves or is still . It is n't a matter of more time . Do n't be disappointed in me . I wish you so well  --  only , am helpless to make your happiness . If by happiness is meant a sort of vigorous peace of mind , then I hope  --  against all morality  --  itcan be conferred on you with no suffering on your part or even effort . ( This may be the sense in which perfectionism , in my case , is linked to sin . ) Downstairs , Margaret was playing " I 'm in the Mood for Love " ; was playing her last card . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath his head and a letter beside him , grieved for her as much as for anybody.  |p104Caroline  Bell 's body was not white but nutritiously pale , like pastry or a loaf , even having the slight flaws  --  tiny tag of a mole on neck or breast , scar on the knee from a childhood fall  --  that might have formed in a process such as baking . When she raised herself on an elbow or lay with outspread arms , the space of her belly was a lap , the paired curve of shoulders was matched to an imminent embrace . This could not be guessed until she was naked : until then , sensation itself was clothed . She was wearing nothing but a small round watch . " Soon they 'll be home . " Even Grace was they , that afternoon in September . Even Peverel was home . In Paul Ivory 's room , at the top of the Thrales ' house , the bedsteadwas brass , the discarded , trailing counterpane a swag of white crochet . It was the room of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a pure wall . On the white bed , Paul and Caro arranged head to shoulder , chin to temple , thigh to thigh , ingeniously . " No one will come up here anyway . It being Sunday , I being hard at work , you being out . " " Where am I exactly ? " " On the road near Romsey , enjoying the walk . " Paul kicked an entanglement of patient white crochet . " Oh Caro , how lucky this is . " Sufficiency was like deliverance : he had been suffocating and now breathed freely . He was familiar enough with pleasure to know it might become jaded or reluctant ; but joy was literally foreign to him , a word he would never easily pronounce , an exhila/ration that had some other , reckless nationality . For this reason , Caro 's wholeness in love , her happiness in it , made her exotic . Paul said , " I have locked the door . " In the brass rods and finials behind her head , Caro 's fingers were vaguely grappled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which people thought strong , revealed an underside soft as an infant 's and scarcely grooved in the elbow . Her other hand slipped through and through Paul Ivory 's hair with all possible tenderness . In his mind he could see it happening , his fairness falling through her fingers in the white room . He told himself , This is real at any rate . And could feel her think the same . He reached for the covering , drew it up to her chin . Then slowly down . They laughed : the unveiling of a monument . In the wall there was the window of blue sky , green leaves on a bough of elm . Once , an angular little plane passed slowly over , the silver-paper sort that might have taken children for joy-rides between the wars : a toy plane that had whirred in a grassy peacetime field while a man in overalls lunged at the propellor and shouted " CONTACT . " They were as much part of that aerial brightness as of the locked , earthly , domestic room . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Paul having learned the story of Grace and Christian at the Albert Hall . " Our destiny , as well as theirs . " He had called it luck , but now she spoke of destiny . As if she said to him , You must choose . It was the way of women to require choices , sortings , and proofs ; and then to attribute blame . The Judgment of Paul . Caro said , " I never liked afternoons , till this . " In a corner there was a wardrobe so heavy you thought at once of men who had heaved it up the stairs fifty or sixty years ago , grunting and putting their backs into it . Over a chest of walnut drawers , there was a blurred photograph inscribed in ink with the date 1915 . Even a mildewed snapshot of an English cottage , if it was labelled 1915 , was smirched and spattered with a brown consciousness of the trenches . Even in a room of love . Beneath the picture , Paul 's brush and comb were set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French cologne : all blond on a lace mat . The band of his discarded watch rose in two brief arcs , ready for his wrist . Most objects of the kindp106were so solemn you nearly smiled , but Paul 's possessions had their owner 's electricity . Paul said , " We should be somewhere in the sun . " " The sun is here . " He meant her to think of a simplified shore with palm trees or Italian pines . But she did not believe in this film set , which she stared at before closing her eyes . His urge to move on made an end , or denied a beginning . From her now prodigious knowledge , she could have assured him that what he sought was found . " Well , " she said , " it 's here . The sun . " She would have liked merely to have it recognized . Paul preferred what he discovered for himself . " I had in mind real warmth . Heat , sand , the sea . " He placed their hands together  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior fingers . " Lemon groves , vineyards , white walls . " Taunting her with lack . A test of wills , when everything might have had an easy virtuosity . " Why are you unkind ? " Women are born , he thought , with that question on their lips . And amused himself a moment searching for its male counterpart  --  I hope in time you 'll forgive me . He said , " A la guerre comme a la guerre . " " What war is there between us ? " she wondered . Yet wondered too at how poor , in French , his accent was . " No , it 's all right . If you like it here . " He laughed , and gave up the excursion for her sake . Like realization , his glance followed her outstretched arm and raised knee . He put his lips to her breast . It was in that moment they heard the car . Not the rumble of a Hillman or Wolsey or the bronchial change of gear with which a van might mount the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound in showroom condition that made its way intently , playing on the house from far off , then on the wall and open window , like a raking beam of light . It was then , in their primordial attitude , they heard the car . Caro 's head relapsed on the white pillow . Paul sprang . " If she should come in , " he said . " If she should come upstairs and find the door locked . " Tertia was she , that day and after . Paul was already in his shirt , and held a tie ; having snatched up , for this occasion , more formal clothes than usual . On the gravel , wheels were scattering stones . The castle itself had come to find them.  |p107The  machine stopped more conclusively than any engine ever . " Paul . " A steel door slammed . " Paul . " There had never been such final sounds , such pauses , ultimatums , and high-pitched unquestioning calls . And Caroline Bell lay still . Paul was at the window now . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was smiling and leaning and making room for his casual elbows . " Anything up ? " There was the hard intimacy of tone , the naturalness with which he did not use her name . If he had even added so much as " Tertia . " Tertia Drage came right below the window : a pink dress , an upraised face . Perhaps she had not expected Paul to appear at once , but showed no surprise and , despite the standing down there , no sense of disadvantage . Any more than Paul did  --  standing easy in , merely , the shirt and tie ; and , as far as Tertia was concerned , fully dressed . Seeing them now , an onlooker might have judged them well suited . " It 's a glorious afternoon . " Tertia said so without fervour . There was a strip of pink silk round her head , a leather driving glove on her right hand . " We should make use of it . " " What 's the plan then ? " They were at one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spontaneity . Both were secretive , though not private persons , whose undercurrent of sarcasmallowed disavowal of any inadvertent sincerity . With Tertia , the archly antagonistic mood was already habitual . She raised her derisory hand . " You know the possibilities as well as I. " The sound of the motor had been a truer voice than hers , and more responsive . Out of sight below the window Paul Ivory 's bare feet had crossed themselves , negligent as his folded arms . Small fair hairs curled on his naked thighs . " Nothing too arduous , " he said , or was saying , when from the fixing of Tertia 's limbs he knew that Caro stood beside him . He knew that Caro had come up behind him and was by his side at the window . Her bare shoulder , perfectly aloof , touched his own . He did not turn , but , as if he himself were Tertia Drage , saw Caro standing naked beside him at that high window and looking down ; looking down on the two of them . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Caro 's hand rested on the sill . She was wearing nothing but a small round watch . Moments passed , or did not pass . Tertia stood impassive . Only that her arm stayed raised , her gloved fist clenched and extended like a falconer 's . She was looking straight up at Paul ; not staring but looking hard and fast at him only . She said , " It 's up to you . " " I 'll come down . " For perhaps the first time they met each other 's eyes . At the window Caro did not move . Paul withdrew and took up the rest of his clothes . His departure exposed completely the upper part of her body . Flesh-coloured light was striking her shoulder and making reddish streaks in heavy hair that fell over the collar-bone . Below , Tertia was walking round the car and opening the door . She got in , leaving the driver 's seat free . In the room above , the bed creaked as Paul pulled on his canvas shoes . With no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the bureau , glancing at it as he strapped it on . He might have been late for an appointment . A door all but closed . Stairs thudded to Paul Ivory 's quick feet . He appeared on the path below the bedroom window , and dropped his jacket into the car . " You want me to drive . " " If you please . " Their voices were neither lowered nor lifted : you might have said , level . And Tertia was roughly pulling off her glove . There was the prompt roar of the car . As if someone swung on a propellor yelling " CONTACT . " Captain Nicholas Cartledge was waiting for a train . His tweeds were the colour and texture of fine sand . Beige and granular , he stood on an asphalted branch-line platform in a blaze of Sundayafternoontedium . The railway dollop of bitumen virtually annihilatedan entire sweet countryside . Even the radiant day could raise colour only where rust had overflowed on cement , and in a stain of slack dahlias round a signpost . Nicholas Cartledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his small cloth bag on the asphalt , in order to stroll the length of the platform and return . Once a cuff flicked up , white , to compare time with the station clock ; but he drew no apparent conclusion from ap109discrepancy . If someone had remarked on the boredom , he would have said , It does n't bother me . " He saw that the local taxi , an old green Humber that could be phoned for , had stopped at the station steps , and that Caroline Bell was getting out of it . With the slightest vibration of surprise he went down to help her and , before she had recognized him , was leaning in to pay the driver . She stood on the pavement holding out to him in the palm of her hand an assortment of half-crowns and sixpences . Cartledge said , " For pity 's sake , " and picked up her bag , no larger than his own , and a light raincoat . Relieving her of these things , he suggested expropriation . He and she went up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side by side . The dahlias limply circled the signpost , like sluggish water round a drain . Cartledge said , " Headed for London , I take it , " and did not seem to wonder . He had an authority associated with imperviousness . Caro had scarcely spoken , and might not have remembered his name . She was decorously dressed , and showed  --  or betrayed , as the saying goes  --  no emotion whatever . Yet he might have said her appearance was wild , not only because that summarized an evident situation but because of an emanation of helpless shock . She refused a cigarette , and did not want to sit down . They walked along the glittering platform , and back . Pale socks showed above his supple shoes . You could not say they walked together , or that he made any effort to close the distance she left uetween them . An elderly couple in black sat on a bench and watched with a perspicacity whetted by Sunday doldrums : " There 's some story there . " Inclined to side with Cartledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had those excellent clothes , one of the old school with his light hair and his expensive face , lean and polished . " A real old rake , " the wife said , as Cartledge passed again where she herself sat motionlessunder a toque of rayon violets . " Or roue , " she added , to reinforce . But soon resumed about her own Sunday : " Well Fred it was a long time afore you talked me into visiting Maude , and it 'll be longer next time . " Standing by their baggage , which provided a destination , Captain Cartledge shook ash . " It was clear you would come to grief in that place . " He did not expect an answer , but after a while turned to look  --  at her head , her breasts . She watched him do this with dispas/sion that was , as he saw , a variant of whatever trouble she was in . Eventually he did say , " If I can help . " She might have been smiling at the irony . " To grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse , " he agreed , identifying the form of it . " You could not have come to a more sympathetic auditor . " She had not in fact come to him , but his assurance would have required an onslaught to disrupt it . When the train drew in he threw down his cigarette and lifted their two bags . She walked ahead into an empty compartment , where she sat by the window , pallid and peculiar , for the old couple to remark on for the last time , as they passed , " More there than meets the eye . " " This will help . " He spilled a few drops of it with the starting up of the train . She saw the initials NGWC in the silver . He dried the overflow from his fingers with a white handkerchief while she drank , then poured a very little for himself . The handkerchief had the same initials coiled in a corner . He said , " Take your time . " He sat back opposite her , politely arranging his tailored legs not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little window . " There is plenty of time . " He did not mean there was time for existence to resume but that she would come to accept what must now occur . There was the silver and the linen , the granular tweed , and the dirty rim of the window . She had clasped her hands in her lap , a becalmed attitude she and her sister both adopted under stress ; and held his gaze , unthinking , unblinking . Hills and dales wobbled past the window . A factory momentarily obliterated the view , and was swiftly withdrawnlike the wrong slide on a projector . There was a damp , metallic smell in the compartment , an ancient reek of upholstery , a whiff from a nearby lavatory , and the more immediate taste of brandy . He said , " I am at your disposal , " but she would not be deceived , or scarcely heard . As to her silence , he would have said , " It does not bother me . " He pondered whether it might have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left  --  for Glasgow , Edinburgh , or possibly Paris . The fact of Paul Ivory was a shade more interesting , if only for caste reasons . There were stations of rusted dahlias , from which the sun successivelywithdrew . In field after field , the hops were strung up . Somewherenear the front of the train the old couple dozed ; and oncep111the wife asked , between snoozes , " What do you think that word comes from  --  roue ? " saying it rooey and getting no reply . Caro 's hair touched the window-frame . She did not close her eyes . Cartledge said , " It has not harmed your looks , you know . " She asked , " How much longer ? " And his cuff went up . Then , " At what station do we arrive ? " Not calling him Nick , as he had said to . " You were intending to go  --  where ? " " There 's a place in Gloucester Road where they take Austra-lians . " " My dear , you make them sound like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Failing that , another of the kind in Cromwell Road . " " You 'll be much better off in North Audley Street . Where I take Australians . " He offered her the flask again , the sun glinting on it as on a gun-barrel . " I assume , by the way , " he said , " that you left the inevitable note on the pincushion  --  some convincing and quite fictitious explanation ? " They swayed along among diminishing hops and burgeoning kitchen gardens . Two men in adjacent green back yards reached to each other companionably across a wall ; or could have been grappling . The sky was falling redly on the land now , and a hillside loomed like a haunch of beef . Captain Cartledge shook cigarettes from an ordinary pack , though somewhere there would be an initialledsilver case to match the flask . He said , " On Sunday nights they always leave something out for me . Soup , chicken . My couple , I mean . " So there was a couple , leaving a cold supper ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well done , thou good and faithful servant . Captain , my Captain . Couple , my Couple . Captained , coupled . There would be sheets , pillowcases , linen initialscoiled to spring . The Captain in his shadowed corner was cool above the white blaze of collar and cuffs  --  apt streaks like markings of a racehorse . He had not , as he might have put it , so much as laid a finger on her . He said , " Better at any rate than a dark night of the soul in the Gloucester Road . " " At any rate " put the thing in perspective . There was headed sweat at her hairline . If she blacked out or went to pieces he would have bitten off more than he could chew.  |p112But  she remained distinct , integral , contemptuous , in her place opposite . He added , " Night brings , among other things , counsel . " From the syntax it was apparent he had said this before . The sky was settling either into a rose-ripe composure of summer evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you looked at it . They were crossing a maze of tracks near the river , and there was a fine view of St. Paul 's . Caro was on her feet , reaching up to the rack for her bag . He said , " For pity 's sake , " as he had said at the station , and lifted the bag down for her . They were standing , balancing , a few inches from each other and she had her hands by her sides . Her lips were lightly drawn back so that the lower teeth showed , and in that instant she might have been considered cruel as he . She looked in his face . " I have already made love today . " He staggered to keep his feet as the train belted for home , then rocked on his toes , in control . He was taller than she by about five inches . " I 'm aware of the terms . All the same , let 's see if we ca n't offer you something short of martyrdom . " He glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was first on the platform . Following , she saw his quick sleeve raised : " Taxi . " And got into his dark cab while he was still giving the address.  |p115My  dear CaroThere are sixty thousand students in Paris , most of them in the corridor outside this room . Last week , however , the building was desertedfor Easter and calm as a monastery . My window looks on a courtyard full of flowering trees  --  hawthorn , a Judas tree , and , very near , a big lilac coming out in purple pyramids . There is a fountain and  --  concealed  --  a thrush . During the holiday I drove with two French colleagues to the mines near Lille , where we went down a pit . The coal-face straight from Dante , worked by boys of sixteen or so , mostly North Africans who spoke no French . Worse than this were the hovels they went back to afterwards , ten to a filthy hut . Having uselessly petitioned the Ministere du Travail on behalf of these people , my two friends are helping them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the First World War cemeteries of Vimy and Notre-Dame-deLoretteand a quarter of a million graves . I work . I think of you . These are not alternating propositions  --  I think of you always . Since writing you last , I 've been to a show of drawings by Leonardo , a one-man industrial revolution . Have seen a good play , Le Diable et le Bon Dieu , as well as Jean Vilar and Gerard Philipe in Le Cid , a judo championship , and Senator Kefauver on television . Kefauver dismaying enough , God knows , but I am regarded as his champion here , there being so much facile and uninformed anti-Americanism among my colleagues . I dislike unanimity ( or solidarityas it 's perniciously called ) , and anyway the mindless Soviet and China worship bores me  --  particularly in this land of en principe . The man I came here to work with continues to impress me , humanly and professionally . It is true he 's made mistakes , in part because he has done so much . Those who undertake less can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  whether of the soul or the intellect  --  are safest , and of course most critical , of all . It 's easy enough to denounce  --  all you need is ill will . ) What an atrocious , sustained effort is required , I find , to learn or do anything thoroughly  --  especially if it 's what you love . A vocation is a source of difficulty , not ease . To do is difficult enough . To be , more difficult still . Both to do and be demand an effort at superhumanity . Well , why not ? Anything is preferable to the safe side of the line . The students are early potatoes , forced too hard , the pace terrific . They come here at eighteen from the lycees , and after one year take the equivalent of B.A. All are " serious " and engages . ( I 'm thoroughly sick of that word . ) The place is plastered with Marxist literature , and one in four are Party members . Yet they spend their nights playing brutal practical jokes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fairly frightening on the premises , they are touchingly young and earnest when seen on the Boulevard Saint-Michel , where they pass what free time they can manage . They make me feel both sedate and gauche . The new French government is identical with the one before , and will fall as quickly . Will we end up with Europe going fascist again , " defended " by a German army with American commanders and American weapons , itching to cross the Elbe ? ( When you consider how real the Soviet menace is , it 's remarkable that the countering dementia on our side can almost make you disbelieve in it . ) One bright spot has been the death of de Lattre , raising some faint hope of a settlement in Indo-China . His funeral was a monstrous exhibition of militarism  --  schools closed , vast processions with Eisenhower , Montgomery , the cabinet , bands , choirs , clergy , troops , the lot . Lying in state at the Arc de Triomphe , Notre Dame , Les Invalides . A thoroughly Prussian performance . If Leonardo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped the atomic bomb , and to clamorous French applause . Among the students , as with my colleagues here , there is often a background of poverty . There 's no charade around this as in our countries  --  nodissembling by the poor , no fantasy of brotherhood on the part of the affluent . I remember the university people who used to come round Ancoats in my childhood , adopting our speech and clothes to show a kindred spirit  --  a sentimental condescension that does damn all for poverty . Membership in the proletariat does n't come that cheap . What did it do for us , their guilt-edged security or the moral outrage they exchanged on their way home to their employed parents  --  and to their hot water and their books and music and savings-accounts , none of which they had immediate intention of sharing ? What were theirp117overalls to me , who 'd have given anything to see my mother in a decent dress ? In themselves , rags confer morality no more than they do disgrace . The poor do n't want solidarity with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depression , Ted Tice 's father had taken him , a boy of nine , to hear a politician speak . Father and son stood in the crowd at the back of a grim hall , and to the child 's questions the father returned his habitual response : " Do n't talk wet . " The speaker was a young Liberal with yellow hair , a lawyer from the district , standingfor the first time . He considered himself one of the poor , but even the boy knew that this young man 's parents had paid his education at the law  --  whereas the rest , lad and lass alike , were in the mill or at the works or on the docks at twelve or fourteen . If they 'd luck enough to find the work . This youth was said to have a wage of three pound ten a week clear , and only one dependent , a paralysed aunt . All the rest was for himself . It was hard to imagine what he did with such a sum . He was in earnest , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the hall called out , " One wick of thi wages 'd change a life here in this hall , if tha 'd but give it . " And the candidate 's fair face flushed : " That 's not the answer . " And the heckler shouted back , " It 'll do to go on wi ' , whilst tha't thinking up a better one . " ) Ted Tice got up and went to his flowering window . He sat down again at his table and looked at what he had just written : " They want change . " Even more than change , they want revenge . Men can make up soon enough with enemies who slaughtered them in battle ; but never with the brethren who humiliated them in cold blood . They take reprisal on their own shame  --  that is what makes all hatreds , in war or class , or in love . And I too want revenge . On a new page he continued : You will have seen the rumpus about the telescope . The Observer piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself for letting me in the house . But I remember vividly the moment when he did , and am grateful . I seek relief from my pro-American role by attacking the United States ferociously to the pleasantest friend I have made here , a young American physicist whose main occupation is finding girls . We spendp118evenings together when he is not flat to the bawds . Through him I 've met a dear little etudiante , a tall ballerina from the New York City Ballet , and a young curatress who is helping mount a vast exhibition of Mexican art and is very strong on pre-Columbian sexual motifs . Ted was divided between the urge to show Caro , and the likelihoodof her seeing through this . Reading over the last lines he crossed out " dear " and " young , " and eliminated the ballerina . He rewrote the page , and went on : Another of the Americans here was married yesterday , and I was in on the wedding , a prosaic little ceremony in a side-chapel of the American cathedral . The priest sounded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champagne was enough to swim in , and I earned the extremely good dinner by listening to a woman telling me all about her citrus ranch and cottage at Monterey . The more annoying as there was , along the table , an interesting couple  --  a man called Vail , who subsidizes various culturalenterprises in America , and his wife . He looked like Orson Welles ( though not as Citizen Kane ) . His wife , thinner than any model and very tall , was beautiful  --  a gaunt face with circular eyes . These two were enclosed in some unhappiness that , because of their intelligence and looks , engaged one 's interest . It had never occurred to me before that unhappiness could be interesting in itself ; God knows my own is not , to me . And I suppose this is the sort of thing novelists have to care about . The man Vail also concerns himself with humanitarian and political causes , and surprised me , in the brief talk we did have , by having noticed the row about the telescope . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . ) He had just come from Tunisia , which , like all the Arab world , seems to be going up in smoke . We had barely begun to talk when a dowager from Pasadena broke in to say that the world must surely improve now , as young people are all so travelled . Vail said , " That 's not travel , it 's dislocation . " Speaking of weddings , I saw that Paul Ivory 's took place . I also saw that his play opened in London . I wonder which will run longest . Ted put the pages together , then added : " I nearly resent these things I have described , because they are life without you . Caro , it is so long . If I could only see you . " And signed his name . Posting a letter to Caroline Bell was an instant of hope and contact , and anticlimax . Ted Tice went down scuffed and noisy stairs , and out into the street . Having dispatched the letter , he keptp119walking as quickly as the crowds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him along with the warmth of his room . It was dusk , there were students in the cafes . Other young people , unable to pay for so much as a coffee , stood on the footpath in groups and talked fast without laughter . Ted thought , It is grim and marvellous by turns , and I may never find out why ; but at least it is n't raw or facile or paltry or sententious or dull . And the absence of self-delusion in itself is liberty . The moment of exhilaration evaporated . It is degrading to fix passionate feeling on another being in the certain knowledge there can be no answering thought . As he walked , Ted Tice turned up the collar of his jacket . He had come out , as usual , without a coat . One of the men he had accompanied to the mines , a Breton going for the agregation , drew away from a group on the pavement and walked with him . Ted thought how his American friend would have asked a question , " Had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans might be the only people left who asked how one felt  --  still imagining one might know , or tell ; or assuming an untroublesome , affirmative lie , some show of a willful unripeness like their own . After posting his letter to Caroline Bell , Ted his solitude . When they reached the entrance of Tice 's building , a group of students pushed past them , laughing and shouting . The Breton said , " It 's melancholy , all this high spirits . " The two men leaned against a wall that was dirty in the way that only institutions of learning can be dirty , with the pressure of too many soiled hands and hips and bottoms propped there in argument or love . Beyond them , the long street slowly flowed in human clusters , taut or flexible ; active with opinion , suffering and lust . The Breton touched Ted lightly on the shoulder . " Just remember , my dear , that women grow old . See you . " Ted had another letter to write , which he had not meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work . Very good to have your letter and your news . Yes , I do have a photograph  --  sincearriving here I 've spent most of my time and a fair proportionof my funds being photographed .

For you , herewith , one copy only , in which I look like the kind of person I disliked most at Cambridge . Since you are really coming over  --  good news  --  I ' 11 try to get tickets for the May festival . They 're giving Berg 's Wozzeck and Stravinsky 's OedipusRex .

Yours.  |p121At  the time when Grace and Caroline Bell got their first employment  --  atHarrods and the bookshop  --  they had made over most of their small capital to Dora . By undertaking to raise them , Dora had incapacitated herself for earning a livelihood , and it seemed right that recompense be made . That was Caro 's reasoning , at least , and all of Caro 's capital went to Dora in the new arrangement , for Caro might soon expect to have some semblance of a career . Grace , whose employment at Harrods lacked even that degree of promise , had retained half her assets at Caro 's suggestion . Explained to Dora , the plan ignited high passion . She wanted nothing , had never asked anything from anyone , had walked to save so much as a bus fare , and the one thing she would never give up to a living soul was her independence . " I will be dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was outraged  --  irrationally but not unpredictably ; and only after many days of tears and cries for peace was prevailed on to accompany the girls to a lawyer 's office where documents were ultimately and emotionally signed . It was a further week before she spoke to them at all normally , or could bring herself to forgive . Dora herself was confused by the indignation aroused in her by the sisters ' gesture . By their action , they had deprived her , however temporarily , of her privileges of victimization . Until she re-establishedher prerogative of disadvantage , she was under a handicap . By her outrage she saw to it that tables were only briefly turned . The event was put behind them , unmentionable , and soon she was talking again about doing without , so that you girls might have everything when I 'm gone . At that time , Dora was not yet forty.  |p122The  signing over of assets had taken place shortly before Grace encountered Christian at the Sunday concert  --  Dora 's umbrage on that memorable afternoon being attributable to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged , Grace told him of the financial arrangement : " It seemed only fair . " Christian said quietly , " How like you , Grace . " " You would have done the same . " Putting the fair hairs back from her forehead , he was touched beyond her expectation . " I should like to think so . " Now Major Ingot appeared to have made their sacrifice irrelevant . When the Major brought Dora to London in the late spring , Christian said he would give a small lunch , or luncheon , at a restaurant . Just himself , Grace , the bridal pair ; and Caro  --  who would ask time off from work . Christian was by then married to Grace and the proper person to do such a thing , but had no affection for Dora , whom he had seen in action now and then . There had been a convulsive scene , incomprehensible , on the occasion of Grace 's betrothal ; and letters from the Algarve had tended to take , from time to time , the unfathomable huff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that Dora could pull herself together  --  could be brought to her senses by a good talking-to , which , he contended , was long overdue and would do her the world of good . Even Grace still imagined there might be words , the words that could reach Dora and that had so far , unaccountably , not been hit upon . Only Caro recognized that Dora 's condition was exactly that : a condition , an irrational state requiring professional , or divine , intervention . Major Ingot was thickly built , though in no martial way , having a citified paunch and large pinkish jowl . Within the restaurant doorway he cut the oval sweep of a watermelon . His scalp was smooth except for a splaying of strands over the crown ; his eyes , a hurt blue , were the eyes of a drunken child . At table he spread short hands on the menu , flattening out this plan of attack . A wedding-ring was already tight on his finger , like a knot tied there to remind , or the circlet fixed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his collar . Everything about him was contained , constrained , a fullness tied and hound . It was hard to imagine himp123a soldier ; although he had a desk-bound corpulence that might have done for a general . When asked by Christian about his military service , he produced staccato information before ordering crab salad . Salad was not reliable in Estoril , nor seafood either . On the eve of departure , Dora had been poisoned by a plate of king prawns . The bill of the Portuguese doctor had come , with the medicines , to thirty pounds . " And that , " said Major Ingot , " made it an expensive meal . " " Bruce was ropable , " Dora told them . " And Bruce is usually a patient body . " The Major redly glared endorsement . They must return to Portugal within the month , there was everything to be done to the flat . Curtains , upholstery , Dora already had the swatches . In addition , Rastas , the Major 's Labrador , was in a kennel . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to picture him in the ingle of a pub in Algarve England saying , " Let me tell you the one about . " Retribution emerged as a main preoccupation : " They have made their bed and must lie in it , " " He will just have to take his medicine "  --  making of life a military , or prison , hospital . In the postwar scramble , the Major had been lucky ; had , as he explained , fallen on his feet . In the free-for-all , some landed right side up , others came a cropper . Around the table , the Major 's punitive figures of speech aroused antipathies that were scarcely coherent . The truth was they were too reminiscent of Christian himself . To revert one moment to the poisoned prawns . If I may . For just such reasons there was a big future in the Algarve . British residents liked what they were used to  --  Twinings Earl Grey , Coopers VintageMarmalade . Possibilities were pretty well infinite  --  Tiptree , Huntley and Palmer , to give a bare idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could the liquors be disregarded , Gilbey 's , Dewar 's . " It is all there for "  --  the Major made a deft , pink , snatching gesture above the tablecloth  --  " the taking . " No , the Major was not thinkingof getting into books . " It 's a small turnover . Make no error , I like nothing better than a rattling good yarn myself . But the turnoverdoes n't justify . Your average tourist is not a big reader . Guidebooksnow  --  well , there you 're on to a horse of a different colour . "  |p124There  was no need to get mixed up with the Ports . The foreign residents out there were a well-to-do crowd , on the whole . Germanswere coming back too , you 'd be surprised . They preferred the Algarve to the Costa Brava , which had already been developed out of extinction . Furthermore , the government was stable . More so , he was sorry to say , than this lot we 've got here at home . " These socialists would n't dare show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would soon laugh on the other side of their faces . " I would n't live here if you paid me . " Thunder could be heard . Through the restaurant 's glass doors , they saw a deluge . As to the prime minister , the Major continued , " I would n't trust him with sixpence on the table "  --  slamming down the imaginary coin  --  " while I stepped out of the room . " Dora dealt out photographs , like trump cards , of herself in the sun . The Major said , " I 'd have taken more , but I 'd used up most of the roll on the dog . " Christian was surprised by Dora 's good looks . He had always felt her nature did not come commensurately through in her appear- , ance , and now that she was plumper and complacent  --  and kept the speckled veil , still suggestive of a bridal , turned up around her hat  --  it was hard to credit her awfulness . With her dark eyes and high colour , she might herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not been for the mouth . Contrasted with Dora 's rounded self-approval , Caro was holloweyed , the pale , impressive ghost at the feast despite a crimson dress . Only Grace truly looked her part , a sweet young matron with no darker side . Dora was telling , " Bruce has an eye . And has picked up some exquisite pieces . Majolica , old rugs . " The Major agreed : " If I say so myself . " ( It occurred to Christian , like a warning , that this phrase usually preceded falsehood . ) " I can go into any junk shop and pick out the one thing . " Again , a show of thick , short fingers . " Of course , out there you have to bargain . " When it was agreed that bargaining went against the grain , there was a pause . Christian was thinking that in England a gentleman does not wear a wedding-ring . Dora resumed : " Caro is looking so well . And happy . " They all turned towards gaunt Caro , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " Dora was queening it . " And try her Portuguese . " It was explained to the Major : " She has this gift . " Caro smirked a bit , to please . Christian was thinking , A signet ring  --  well , that would be another matter . A horse of a different colour . The Major said languages were unusual in an Orstrylian . He had a friend at Brisbane who was in dried fruit and nuts . Christian lit a cigarette , and hoped his relation to the Major was not that of brother-in-law . Dora remarked that her own language was good enough for her . The Major was off on a story about an Australian nurse in a military hospital . He knew the soldier , actually , to whom the incidenthad occurred . When the coffee came , Grace got awkwardly to her feet , cup in hand as if she might propose a toast . Above a blouse of lavender flowers , her face and forehead shone . She set the cup down as deliberately as if it , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grace was to have a child . The London theatre where Paul Ivory 's first full-length play was given had a small foyer which , at the end of that afternoon 's matinee , was emptying slowly because of the rain . Women shuffled out in single file , and a few elderly men waited under the awning , wondering what came next . Caroline Bell stood to one side , unfasteningher umbrella while she looked through glass doors at a tawdry street . Paul entered from a small interior door near the ticket booth : himself an actor on cue . Finding the crowd still there , he hesitated . And in that moment saw Caro , who had her back to him , her face obscured as if deliberately turned away . Paul Ivory stood with his hand on the door he had just opened , a man who controls himself under an accusation . The unfairness was not only that the woman had been placed in his path but also that , given her unawareness , the choice was left to him whether to speak . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of Caro , and by the deliberate , detached authoritywith which fate had again produced her . Paul had measured his forgetfulness of Caroline Bell by the swift current of change andp126achievement in his recent months of life . He had not merely left her but left her behind . From the standing-room assigned her in the theatre of Paul Ivory 's existence , Caro should pensively observe his performance , and applaud . Now , at the sight of her averted head , he had no choice , and must act under compulsion . He approached her with some consciousness of exaltation , obeying an impulse not necessarily to his advantage . Obeying his need as if it were virtue . All this because a dark girl stood at a door with a furled umbrella in her hand . " Caro . " So she turned , and again they stood side by side . With his own sensations fresh in him , Paul saw her spasm of surprise and the sequence of quick , contradictory impulses . There was even recognition that she had run , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and a flash that answered his own compulsionbut was dourly mastered . Her lips closed to a deliberate curve he had not seen before because it derived from his desertion . The lobby was by now almost empty . Lights had been turned out . They made a dark pair , standing by the doors . She said , " Yes ? " as if accosted by a stranger . But trembled in the raincoat with her whole body so that she felt the separate stuffs of her clothes , and her anatomy delicately beating within . In the same way her mind struggled , tremulous , inside the event . " You were good to come , Caro . " " I am glad to have seen it . " " I 'm hardly ever here . There 's been a change in the cast , the part of Mandy , the tubercular son , and I wanted to see how it went . " Automatic speech , anything to pass these moments . She had never before seen Paul in a city suit . For his part he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a formidable loveliness . He had expected to leave her behind him . Impressions came and went in them , like quick tides . Paul said , " Would you care to see backstage ? " They walked down a corridor of whitewashed grime . " Mind the steps . " The stage had marks on it -- -a stroke of chalk , a stencilled arrow . The curtain , of stale , unclean crimson , was clown , there was the glum furniture of the last act . At a time when Shakespeare was played in modern suburban dress or leather jackets , Paul Ivory'sp127contemporary , working-class play was being acted out in royal robes . Father and Mother loomed as stage tyrants , crowned and majestic in purple and gold , while their subjected offspring coweredin cardigans and dungarees . This fairly obvious device had been called a stroke , or shaft , of genius in the press . Caroline Bell accompanied Paul through a dingy labyrinth , never lowering her eyes . When they paused at a doorway she shook her hair back so that her face was entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul smiled his open , remembering smile : " Thanks , Collis . " They went down a short flight , and Paul knocked on another door . Caro was introduced to the great actor , who said , " If you do that again I 'll have your hide . " He was speaking to a dandified boy , who took grapes from a ribboned basket without replying . The embroideredroyal robe hung on the wall . Paul said , " Feel it . " Even a single fold was heavy to handle . The actor told her , " It gives the weight of bloody sovereignty all right . " He had taken the colour off his face , and was wearing a lawn shirt and sponge-bag trousers . A scalding radiator hissed in a corner . Caro loosed her coat . Paul asked her , " What did you think of the Marmite scene ? " Before she could answer , the boy with the grapes said , " It 's the strongest bit in the play . " Caro said , " I was n't convinced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The actor laughed . " We 've been through that . Do n't forget it was a bookshop she worked in . " The boy said , " It 's a bit heavy-handed , the king is dead long live et cetera . Otherwise it 's okay . " The actor asked Paul , " Conder did all right , do n't you think ? " " I 've already told him so . He 'll settle in . Mandy ought to look a damn sight sicker , that 's all . " It was to be noted that Paul smiled less with the actors  --  who , after all , were professionals . The actor said , " Conder could n't look sick enough to suit Valentine . " Valentine was the boy with the grapes . This reference to his jealousy , while excluding the outsider  --  Caro  --  was , in the way of all exclusions , directed at her . The men exchanged a smile . In the corridor the queen-mother sailed past them in long , sharp profile , eyelids and lashes heavily drawn in peacock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Greek trireme.  |p128Paul  said , " Performers never notice anyone but themselves . " He had done the right , or astute , thing in exposing Caro to his attainment , summoning up his auxiliaries . He said , " Are you working in that office now ? " " Yes . I had a half-day off , there was a lunch for my sister . " " Same old cast of characters . " Confirming his advantage . They had reached the street door . " Me included . " He put his hand on the doorknob and leaned against the wall , not really detaining her . " Me too , Caro . " Behind him , aphorisms , all more or less obscene , were scratched or scribbled on whitewashed brick . Her uplifted face , expressionless . She reached past him ; but would not put her hand over his to take the doorknob , and hesitated , poised and thwarted . He saw she could not speak . She reached again for the door and kept her eyes on him , like a captive who edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and alluring impression that she addressed herself to an objective beyond the small , egoistic drama of their own desires . Paul said , " You always had some contempt for me . " " Yes . " " And love too . " " Yes . " A flicker over her stare was the facial equivalent of a shrug . " Now you have a wife to give you both . " They stood fronting one another . Paul removed his hand from the door . " Caro . For pity 's sake . " The figure of speech appeared to move her , and for an instant it seemed she might laugh . Again he pressed what he took for an advantage : " Have a bit of mercy . " She herself leaned back on the chalky wall , and closed her eyes . " How should you hope for mercy , rendering none ? " " These walls are full of dirty quotations , one way and another . " There was silence while she leaned there , austere with her umbrella , sheathed and closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , to pull at the heavy door . From behind her , Paul said , " You 've got white all over your back . " And in the most natural way in the world brushed his hand down her coat . Then passed his arms about her waist and put his mouth to the nape of her neck , and said , " Almighty God . " They walked in the wet street . Paul took hold of the loosened belt of Caro 's raincoat and seemed to lead her through the rush/hour crowd  --  not pulling but establishing contact and mastery , so that she accompanied him like an acquiescent animal on a leash or rein . At the corner he signalled a taxi , and gave the driver an address . When they got in , he said , " We might take a look at my new premises . I 'm fixing up a house I bought . You must tell me what you think . " He held her hand as they sat in the cab  --  literally held it , since it lay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caro sat without speaking , turning towards him her look that was neither sullen nor expectant but soberly attentive ; and , once , a glance in which tenderness and apprehension were great and indivisible , giving unbearable , excessive immediacy to the living of these moments . Paul had seen that look before , when they first lay down together at the inn beyond Avebury Circle . " This is it . " Paul leaned forward to tell the driver . " You can let us off here . It 's a cul-de-sac  --  once in , you ca n't get out . " The rain had stopped . The house was narrow and flat-fronted , a slot of brick severity between two pigeon-breasted buildings with porticoes . By the curb , a man working on the engine of a parked car nodded to them and went on singing : " Roses are flowering in Picardy , But there 's never a rose like you . " Paul used a bright new key . There were smells of paint , plaster , and raw wood . Brown paper was spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasted on it like a warning of plague . Precipitous stairs were shinily white . The yard at the back was muddy and littered with workmen 's discards , although a pile of flagstones showed it would be paved and planted in due course . A sink of pale porcelain stood in the kitchen , strapped and papered , ready to be puttied : a patient in bandages at a dressingstation . In the dining-room the hospital motif recurred . Painters ' cloths were whitely draped over trestles and a table . The smell of paint was antiseptic , anaesthetic . Caro asked , " Is Tertia here ? " The bull by the horns . Paul pushed a painted door delicately with his finger . " Tertia is staying in the country till this is ready for her . " Even a house required advance warning of Tertia . " You 're my first guest . " The living-room took all the next floor , but was narrow nonetheless . Caro walked to the front , then to the hack . They went upp130again . Paul switched on an unshaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was the top room and the largest , not having stairs above . From the windows you could see the houses opposite , then a block of flats . There were espaliered trees that would be protective in the summer , or so Paul said . Several rugs on the bare floor were rolled and tied . The walls were dry , the windows had been cleaned . There were unattached lighting fixtures in a corner , door handles in a cardboard box ; a pair of marble obelisks already decorated the mantel . A telephone had been connected and was placed on the floor . One window was half-way up , because of the fresh paint , and the room was cold . With another bright key , Paul unlocked a built-in cupboard . " Let 's have a drink . " There was a package on an upper shelf of the closet , and a framed painting propped below . Paul showed Caro the picture . She said , " Segonzac is a middle-class painter . " " Not every artist can be supreme . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to a need for manners . " But there is a veracity  --  a keeping of faith , if you like  --  that enhances even some lesser talents . Something Mrs. Thrale said about your father  --  that he was n't a great poet , but he was a true poet . " Paul put the picture away , since it had not served its turn . " Well , " he said , " sit down . Drink to my new house . " It displeased or somehow hurt him that Caroline Bell should recall his father . Caro sat on the pile of rugs . She watched Paul handle a silver flask with her same sardonic look , as if she were about to laugh . " There are no glasses  --  we 'll have to use the cap , I 'm afraid . What 's more , we have to share it . " He handed it to her . " A loving-cap . " She drank . She did not hand the cap back to him , but set it beside her on the freshly waxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors , " and picked up the little container and drained it off . " Would you like another ? " " No . It tasted of tin . " " Tin my eye , that 's sterling silver . " He sat beside her on the rugs . " You must tell me what you think of my house . " " There is so little space . " " Now you 're spoiling things . "  | " What is left to spoil ? " The telephone rang . The bell exploded in the unclad room , ricocheting off walls and ceiling like a burst of bullets . Paul had to kneel to talk . " It is . But I 'd like to know how you got this number . . . . Look , if this is going to press tonight you 'd better read it to me . . . . Very well , you may quote me as follows . I have no response to Mr. Whatsit 's remarks . I am not responsive to viciousness , and I find Mr. Whatsit 's own writings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . Certainly : Q-U-I-N-T , then essence . . . That 's right , exactly like vanilla . Actually , the word means substance of heaven . ' Would you please read that back ? ... That 's it , then . . . . Well , that would have to be after I return from Spain , where I go tomorrow , say the end of  --  yes , that 's good for me . Call me then . " Paul put the phone down . He rose and stood with palms placed together , looking at Caroline Bell as if she needed solving ; recreatingthe frame of mind in which he had brought her there . " Are you really going to Spain tomorrow ? " " Of course not . " He looked round for the flask . " Let 's have another of those tin things . " He handed it to her . " How does it taste now ? " She took a little and handed back the cup . " Now it tastes as if it had your initials on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You used to be  --  " " What ? " " Angelic . But much less beautiful . That , alas , is the way it goes . Now tell me about my house , my play . " " You do n't want opinions , you want approval . " " I do want your approval . " There was another detonation of the phone bell . Paul knelt again to talk . " Yes , this does seem to be Flaxman five  --  No , I 'm afraid she is n't here but I can give her a  --  I 've told you , she is not here but I  --  " At an interjection Paul raised , or hardened , his voice to proceed with his own speech  --  a slight restraint of eyelids showing he was too well bred to close them , even momentarily , in exasperation . " I distinctly told you Mrs. Ivory is not here . " He said " Mrs. Ivory , " instead of " my wife " or " Tertia , " as a Party member might solemnly transform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comical , crouching on the floor while standing on his dignity.  |p132Caro  said , " Tell them you 're going to Spain tomorrow . " " I am certainly not going to stand here "  --  Paul crouched lower  --  " listening to  --  " He stared , then banged the receiver down , the force of the action taking him forward on all fours . He stood up , brushing his trousers . " Hung up on me , the bastard . He thought  --  pretended to think I was the servant . " " That 's because you said Mrs. Ivory like that . " Caro watched Paul wonder about the call , the caller , and Mrs. Ivory . Honourable Tertia . " What sort of voice ? " " Oh  --  educated . " God forbid Mrs. Ivory should take a lover from the lower classes . Below in the street the man went on singing in a voice high and unsteady as an old recording : " But there 's one rose that dies not in Picardy , ' T is the rose that I keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If it 's any satisfaction to you , this is pretty much the situation . " He was speaking of the phone call . " More troublesome than you expected , then . " This was scarcely a question , and Caro , looking up in lassitude from the bound rugs , might have been perfectly indifferent . Her venture at spoiling things by honesty had yielded nothing : honesty must be honestly intended , or its facts are worthless . But Paul considered a moment before saying , " It does create a new degree of isolation . " He was at his most sincere acknowledging displeasure , and his voice , when free of affectation , had a mature colour , resonant , almost beautiful . The clarity of his eyes , which threatened to becomeprismatic as Tertia 's , was retinged by natural resentment . " That is of course because one is keeping up the public pretence at the same time . I daresay there 's nothing new in it . " Even the last remark had no sneer . Paul set his foot on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went on : " For aught I know , all husbands are like me ; And every one I talk with of his wifeIs but a well-dissembler of his woes , As I am . Would I knew it , for the rareness Afflicts me now . "  |p133He  sat with Caro on the rugs again . " Can you wonder that play is never performed these days ? " Beside the chill drama of Paul 's marriage , played out in its interestingsetting of worldly success , Caro 's wound must blanch to a light stroke of experience that it would be tiresome to display . Caro would be instructed , not questioned ; would be addressed , with knowing interpolations : " That alas is the way it goes " ; " Something we must rectify . " Paul , not Caro , would interpret the degree of meaning in their respective lots . That had been decided , as he sat speaking intimately of his life to the person most excluded from it  --  in order to readmit her to the intimacy though not the life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think better of it : a small indecision within a greater . " There is an interesting collusion in it , I suppose . Deceiving one another , she and I agree to deceive , on another level , a larger public . " " And does that appeal to you ? " " I 've always had a taste for the play within the play . " He smiled . " I have an idea . Let 's go to Spain tomorrow . " " And send that man a postcard . " " Which one ? " " Both . " His laughter pealed up and down , like the phone bell . Twine stitches harshly imprinted themselves in Caro 's elbow as she propped herself on the carpets . " I have kept loving you . " Through all the interesting things that have happened to me . " And you love me . " " Yes . " " Honesty 's the best policy . " " That 's a contemptible expression . Like ' crime does n't pay . ' " The same vexed tightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a discourse on rhetoric , are we ? " Caro got to her feet , unhearing ; her remoteness not intended to teach him any lesson . She took her umbrella from a corner , and walked out of the room . The first flight of stairs , down which she quickly and lightly went , was too narrow for him to pass her . When he caught her up at the landing he did put his hand to hers . " Of course I sha n't let you go . " He said this with leniency , coaxing a child out of its caprice ; but his hand was hot and uncertain , as he realized only in touching her.  |p134The  steep little stairs rose above them , a white cliff-face that might or might not be rescaled . " Let me leave here . " " Look , you wanted this , did n't you  --  coming to the theatre , then here ? " " That does n't mean I do n't have better in me . " " You 've gone through enough doors for today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I want to be . Let me go on with my life . Or be at least as I was . Instead of what I 've been all these months , since I knew you . " Vicious enough in themselves , the last words did not come out scathingly but as they might have been uttered by a person long cut off from speech and human society , who now ineptly articulated blunt realities . In Paul , however , they produced new tension ; and the dim electric glow from above , like stage moonlight , showed his face bleached  --  scarcely male , scarcely young . He said , " You look on me as a weakness in yourself . " " All my weakness is distilled in you . " Caro had the effect of interrupting the flow of Paul 's will , so that his aspect slackened , in the way of all beings , even animals , who have lost conviction . A countering result was that Caro herself felt closest to Paul at such moments , and least surprised she should love him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an instinct for the fluctuations of resistance , once again embraced her , putting his arms inside her open coat as if entering her protection . Her umbrellafell to the bare boards with a tactless clatter . She did not raise her arms to him . Paul said , " How cold . How cold you are . " They stood in this way , without change except for movements of Paul 's hands on Caro 's body  --  slight undulations on which the light played cloudily . Withdrawing , she said , " Why should you want this ? " Her back to the downward stairs . The unfurnished ring to the voice , words bare as floorboards . " I do n't know . " A contagion of honesty , the best policy . " It 's the proof of everything I disbelieve . " She would have said , " Yet you believe in God , " but could not implicate God in so much bungling . Paul Ivory rested his palm against the wall beside her head ,  |p135|pro|p|ping  himself there to await her surrender . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was huge : he had the upper hand . The light was turning his figure supple yet metallic , the colour of pewter . It is not often that Venus passes before , and occults , so bright a star . He made a little distance between them so he might watch her yielding . He had opened her dress , and the exposed streak of flesh within outdoor clothes was oddly shocking . There was the loosed raincoat and red unbuttoned bodice , then the secret slit of white . Unlike many images of Caroline Bell he later sought to preserve , this one did fix itself in Paul Ivory 's memory : the stark wall , the stairs up and down , her red dress ; and the flare of her breast which she left gravely revealed , like a confession.  |p136You  asked me about Paul Ivory 's play . I saw it only last month . I was impressed , and perhaps surprised by his ease in handling the workingclassmilieu . I think you might be suspicious of it  --  some of the effects spurious , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks as if it will run forever , so you may see it when you get back from France . Caro stopped writing , and read the passage over . How sincere , judicious . How much easier it is to sound genuine when being derogatory . Caro sat at her office desk remembering Paul Ivory 's play and how , for an instant at the end of the final act , the audience had remained silent after its ordeal . Here and there in the theatre a click or tick , a slight crackle such as one hears at potteries among baked wares cooling from the furnace . And then the fracturing applause . Good that you can go to the Rome conference before returning here  --  I saw something about it in the papers . In Rome I remember a palace designed on a nobleman 's horoscope  --  that is to say , decorated with representations of planets and pagan gods . Mere astrology , but perhaps you 'll manage to see it all the same . It was thus assured that Ted Tice would pass his happiest hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiber . There will scarcely be time to write again before you get back to England . Thank you for asking me to dinner , that will be lovely . Until one month , then , from today . Caroline Bell posted this letter on her way home at noon . Saturdaywas a half-day at her office , and she stopped to buy food top137provide lunch for Paul . She was living at that time in a top-floor furnished flat , rented from an office friend who had been posted abroad . It was near the Covent Garden market , in a building otherwiselet to printers and publishers . Noon came like glory into the narrow sooty brick of Maiden Lane , and expanded with architectural intention at the market . The city rose to the sun 's occasion . And Caroline Bell was grateful for a bodily lightness never felt before , which she knew to be her youth . She walked with paper bags in her arms , smilingto think of her lost youth , discovered at the ripe and adult age of twenty-two . Paul was in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , then leaned down from the step to embrace her . With the paper bags and a bunch of red flowers she made quite a bundle . " Why is this woman smiling ? " " I was thinking about adulthood , and adultery . " " Funny , I was thinking about adultery myself . Have you got the key ? " She gave it . They went up linoleum stairs , past doorways sealed with weekend finality . In an old building like this , dust settled quickly , and the unlocking of these small businesses each Monday was a mere deferral , each time surprising , of eventual , ordained oblivion . Paul said , " Saturday afternoon in England is a rehearsal for the end of the world . " When they paused on a landing to breathe , he said , " These have been the best weeks of my life . " The flat was a large room with windows along one side and a blotched skylight at the far end . One wall was entirely covered by books on warped shelves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nearly ragged , in which traces of reddish design could still be discerned , like industrial gases in a twilit sky or bloodstains inexpertly removed . A downward sag of ceiling , shelves , and floor was reproduced in a slump of studio couch that stood against the books and was covered by a new blue counterpane . There was a fine old table , scarred , and two chairs . The only picture was Caro 's angel from Seville , on a wall near the kitchen door . Everything was worn , or worn-out , even the smirched sky . The hooks supplied humanity , as they are supposed to do . Otherwise you might have said dingy , or dreary.  |p138Paul  sat on the fresh counterpane , his hands poised on his knees . Caro called from the kitchen , " Are you hungry ? " " I shall be . " She switched off the derelict stove and came back and stood beside him . He was turned towards the wall , looking at the books . " Very much a library , is n't it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bartlett . " " That 's the reference shelf . " " While we provide the-erotica . " He drew her down on the sofa , so that she knelt while he lay . " This is our shelf , this sofa . This bed thy centre is , these walls thy sphere . " " It 's the name of a symphony , the Erotica . " " Here 's something I want . " The book was so heavy he had to sit up again and draw it out with both hands . He flopped it open on their laps , powdering the bedcover with reddish dust . " Unobtainablenow . I can use it in what I 'm working on . " It was an edition of old plays . " Well , you could borrow it , I suppose . I suppose you could . " Caro lifted it off her knees and wandered about the room . She pulled curtains across , put the vase of anemones on the table . She took off her clothes . He said , " To keep , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Caroline Bell laced her hands together on the crown of her head . Her extended torso became both commandingand vulnerable . Paul thumped the book to the floor at the bedside and lay down , watching . And in the veiled light , with an antique density of books behind him , might have done for a Victorian illustration : young body relapsed on blue and red , white-shirted arm dangling towards a fallen book . Childe Harold , The Death of Chatterton . Caro said as much . " Thanks . Now come here . " She came to the bed and lay by him . Paul said , " To think this waits for me , day and night . " He took locks of her coarse hair and spread them in dark rays round her head . " Hair like a horse . " She said , " My love . My lover . " " Do you remember , the first time , near Avebury , I told you I 'd never felt deeply . Or enough . I want to tell you now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone , what I feel for you . "  |p139She  touched his face . That day at Avebury she had touched his hand to the veneer bedstead ; and he had said , " Whatever enough means . " Paul sometimes still thought she looked foreign  --  by which he meant she never quite belonged to him . He said , " Possession is nine points of the law . " But this was much later , when he lay looking at the dusty room and thinking that youth was a help , because these particular moments , of languor , and underclothes on chairs , would otherwise seem a portent of deeper weakness . The flowers , now , were flat , red , garish . He said , " I was sleeping . " " And I was watching you . " She might have meant , watching over ; but that did not occur to Paul , who showed his slight facial tension of displeasure or alarm . He said , " Unnerving to be watched in sleep . That 's the way men lose everything  --  their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would not tell how he himself had watched Caro 's sleep , on the night she had first come to his new house . Watched her breath and her slight movements of dream , and skin so transparent that he might imagine the innards shaping her and the small , complex reproductive organs with their ability to change the world . As the sun came up he had watched over this phenomenon  --  sufficient in its beauty , so that you might hardly believe reason and articulation and human wakefulnessneed be added ; let alone the capacity for mating . He would not tell this and further increase her strength . He reached his hand down to the floor beside the bed . " I can take it , then ? " She knew it was the book.  |p140In  the government office where Caroline Bell worked there was a young woman called Valda . That she was called Valda was to the point , for she objected to this . None of the other women there objected to being Milly , Pam , or Miranda with their appointed Mr. Smedleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for that matter , to being girls . By that epoch the men themselves were no longer Bates or Barkham to one another , but instant Sam or Jim . Those who had irreducibly formal names , such as Giles or Julian , even seemed to be lagging dangerously and doomed to obscurity . There was one older man in Planning who would say Mister to his subordinates  --  " Mister Haynes , " " Mister Dandridge "  --  like the skipper of an old ship with his first mate or boatswain . But he too , among the women , permitted himself an occasional Marge or Marigold ; althoughat home calling his charwoman Mrs. Dodds . When Caro asked , " If they make a true friend , what will they call him ? " Valda told her : " They 're hoping to put true friendship out of business . " New , compulsory congeniality among males was at least , however , in Valda 's view , a loss equally shared . Unlike the outright seizure of June or Judy . Soon after her arrival Valda had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administrative officer , had come out of his hutch , ears up , holding a button , and asked if she would sew it on . This , he estimated , would not take a minute . Valda politely consented . And , laying aside her papers , brought from a desk drawer a housewifely pouch of needles and coloured threads . With Mr.p141Leadbetter 's jacket aswoon in her lap , she narrowed her own eye to the needle 's and was soon stitching . Leadbetter stood to watch her . His shirt was striped and blue , his trousers came to his armpits , depending from canvas braces , also striped , that had long ago been made to last . It was pleasant to doff his armour and watch the handsome Valda at her humble and womanly task . When she had done , when she had wound the thread and broken it off , he was grateful . " Thank you , Valda . I am not handy with such things . And would jab myself to pieces . " It was important to show appreciation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts : " These are small things to do for one another . " The following week Valda came into his office , where he was reading over a penultimate draft , and asked him to change her typewriter ribbon . Mr. Leadbetter stared . She said , " I am not handy with machines . " He was baffled and displeased . " Have you never needed a new ribbon before ? Were you not trained to do these things ? " " It will not take a minute . " " You had better get one of the girls to show you . " It was incomprehensible . " They will dirty their hands . " She said , " It is a small thing to do . " Now he understood . He went out and got one of the other girls  --  the real girls  --  in a rage . " Miss Fenchurch needs help with her machine . " It was the first time he had not called her Valda , but respect was accorded only from pique . The second girl looked with ingratiating timidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once bent to the machine as if over a cradle . When the time came , Mr. Leadbetter wrote in Valda 's file that she tended to be aggressive over trifles . " Tended " was official code for going the whole hog . There was a small inner room like a cupboard where , morning and afternoon , these girls took turns to make the tea . A list was tacked to the wall , of all the men and their requirements : Mr. Bostock weak with sugar , Mr. Miles strong and plain . Valda 's Leadbetterhad an infusion of camomile flowers , which he bought at Jackson 's in Piccadilly ; these were prepared in a separate pot and required straining . Another notice cautioned against tea-leaves inp142the sink . The room was close and shabby . There were stains on the lino and a smell of stale biscuits . On one spattered wall the paint was peeling , from exhalations of an electric kettle . Sometimes when Valda made tea Caro would set out cups for her on a scratched brown tray . It was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disdainful scruple , the flowers for Mr. Leadbetter 's special pot ( which carried , tied to its handle , a little tag : " Let stand five minutes " ) . To hear her reel off the directions : " Mr. Hoskins , saccharin . Mr. Farquhar , squeeze of lemon . " She filled the indeterminatelittle room with scorn and decision , and caused a thrill of wonderful fear among the other women for the conviction that , had one of these men entered , she would not have faltered a moment in her performance . When Valda spoke of men more generally , it was in an assumptionof shared and calamitous experience . None of the other women entered on such discussions  --  which were not only indelicatebut would have mocked their deferential dealings with Mr. This or That . Furthermore , they feared that Valda , if encouraged , might say something physical . Watching the office women file towards the exit at evening , Valda observed to Caro : " The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea . There was another male faction in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class divisions and of the right , or absence , of opportunity . For these , equally , Valda had no patience . " They do n't quite believe they exist , and are waiting for someone to complete the job for them , gratis . " She would set down the biscuit tin , switch off the electric kettle . " Oh Caro , it is true that the common man is everlastingly embattled , but he has a lot of people on his side . It 's the uncommon man who gets everyone 's goat . " Valda would tell Caro , " You feel downright disloyal to your experience , when you do come across a man you could like . By then you scarcely see how you can decently make terms , it 's like going over to the enemy . And then there 's the waiting . Women have got to fight their way out of that dumb waiting at the end of the never-ringing telephone . The receiver , as our portion of it is called . " Or , slowly revolving the steeping teapot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cast a disc : " There is the dressing up , thep143hair , the fingernails . The toes . And , after all that , you are a meal they eat while reading the newspaper . I tell you that every one of those fingers we paint is another nail in their eventual coffins . " All this was indisputable , even brave . But was a map , from which rooms , hours , and human faces did not rise ; on which there was no bloom of generosity or discovery . The omissions might constitute life itself ; unless the map was intended as a substitute for the journey . These at least were the objections raised by Caroline Bell . For her part , Valda considered Caro as a possibility lost . Caro might have done anything , but had preferred the common limbo of sexual love . Whoever said , " When you go to women , take your whip , " was ' on to something deep , and deeply discouraging . Valda would watch Caro , and think along these lines . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whip , or some comparable attraction.  |p144Wen  Paul Ivory made a two months ' trip to North America , he wrote from Los Angeles to Caroline Bell : My dear , I shall be glad to move on from here  --  not because of film people and exhaust fumes and limitless cemeteries that make Stoke Poges look like headlines , but simply because I 've discovered I can expect only one letter from you at each place I visit , and when I 've had it I might as well move on . Having wanted all my life to come to this country , I now streak through it madly looking for your next letter . A diabolical plot on your part , for which I can never hope to get even . The letters , when I catch up with them , move me to the heart  --  an organ which in my case you invented anyway . I find it strange to be affected by your wisdom when it stops so short in respect to me . From these letters I try to follow your moods , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine solemnity  --  towards what ? the world ? me ?  --  that acts as a degaussing belt ( it 's a thing they put on ships to demagnetize them against enemy mines and radar ) . I find I do not want you to retain any independence or protection from me , especially in the form of good character . Having said this , I acknowledge that my unprecedented equanimity this past year derives from your own ; as you must be aware . Contagion of a kind , one of the risks of venery . This is being written at midnight in a big bed in a little room overlookinga garden  --  part of a suite provided by my masters here . It is precisely a room I have imagined , so much so that I attempt to put the final and most important factor into the picture  --  but it does n't work . There is also a white sitting-room , a terrace with marvellous plants , a bathroom , and even a small kitchen . But the main thing is the bed , which puts the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner called stag . ( How we rush to claim our horns . ) The monarch of this glen scarcely addressed me , which is supposed to be a good sign . Everyone extremely tough in keeping with the tradition , and I did a lot of smiling of the kind you dislike . Things can be accomplished here , so long as you do n't expect to retain your immortal soul  --  I was instantly parted from mine on arrival ; presumably it , or something like it , will be restored to me by the hat-check girl at my departure . On the other hand there is not much listening or questioning , but a great deal of expounding . ( Conrad , was it , who said the air of the New World is favourable to the art of declamation ? ) That is to say , there is a formula , and I must be fitted into it . So far , California offers the greatest contrast imaginable between the works of God and the desecrations of Man . California is a beautiful woman with a foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran across Christian Thrale , who was there , as you no doubt know , for some conference . I liked him better than usual , but am not sure whether this was for intrinsic reasons or because I could say your name . I am shocked and impressed by my love for you.  |p146In  August of the following year , Caro was sitting in a lofty tearoomwaiting for Ted Tice . This restaurant of a London department store overlooked Piccadilly on one side , where light was discreetly veiled ; some sound of traffic from the Circus was modified to prewarrumble by walls of antebellum solidity . Admitting only seemly sounds , the room sheltered none but the decorous . All tables were occupied by women . Waitresses like wardresses kept a reproving eye on performance , repressively moppinga stain or replacing a dropped fork . Something not unpleasant , a nursery security , came along with this . Yet in such a setting you might sicken of women  --  sicken of their high-pitched , imperious , undulant gender , their bosoms and bottoms and dressed hair , their pleats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , natural and assumed , of their sex . In such density they could scarcely be regarded as persons , as men might be ; and were even intent on being silly , all topics sanctified by the vehemence brought to them . Caro felt her abnormality : to be the only one watching , the one not talking , the one who did not particularly want a car or carpet , or a service for twelve . The one who lacked place and protection , yet was not free . At the table next to hers there were two sisters  --  slim , calm , distinguished , both with honey hair and long clear eyes ; the older engaged to a little sapphire ring , the younger perhapsseventeen . Their manners with each other were perfect  --  delicate , courteous , loyal . Offering menus and sugar as politely as if there were no blood tie . If you could be like this , the renunciation of temperament might he worth it.  |p147When  Ted came in , the room of women pulled itself together . As he passed among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bags . It was a power he was acquiring : part of a third possibility unforeseen by those who wondered if Edmund Tice would succeed or fail . Since returning from France , Ted had been working at Cambridge , where once again he lived in furnished rooms . A measure of early recognition was unharmed by his attitude to the proposed telescope , for others had unexpectedly rallied to his position . A woman met through his work had been his mistress some months , but had recently returned to Jodrell Bank . Throughout an autumn and winter they had made love on Saturdays , keeping aloof the rest of the week  --  an arrangement not unlike a dull marriage . When this young woman left for Manchester she had nearly cried , at the same time giving Ted a little smile and turn of the head , as if to say : Hopeless . He realized she had found him an uninspired and selfish lover , and had no mind to tell her why . " What a funny place to meet . " Ted seemed larger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receding from his forehead , still stood up in thick ginger curls . The vertical groove was deeper on his brow . He dropped his newspaper on a spare chair and sat down . When he looked about him it was as if to foresee an end to such a room and its women ; as if he knew of drawing-board plans to storm this citadel . It became plain that the lofty room would soon be divided into two floors , the tearoom becoming a cafeteria with self-service . This had not been clear until Ted arrived and took in the situation at a glance . Sometimes , in such a place , Edmund Tice would think of gentlefolkin rainy towns and damp parsonages . Would imagine families restrained and civil , their gardens , their domestic pets with literary names ; the glazed bookcases with volumes of Sir Lewis Morris or Sir Alfred Comyn Lyall ; The Light ofAsia , an embossed school prize in mock leather . He would know that to die out is different from mere dying ; killed off different from killed . Something  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died before , or at any rate half so quickly ; exterminated by those who had the approved , knowing attitudes , though perhaps no greater virtue . He was to play his part in this destruction and , like others , would mourn when all was safely dead.  |p148Ted  came to London regularly to see Caro . " I enjoyed walking through these grey streets knowing it was to see you . " A simplicity requiring no reply . " Tell me what you 've done all day . " " Listened to people 's grievances . " Caro made room for a platter of coloured cakes and meringues like spiralled shells . " Not that the grievance is n't real . " " That 's the trouble with grievance . It 's usually justified . " When Ted had ordered tea , he asked , " Is there anything there you could care about ? " " Not really . " And not in the way you intend . " Does no one ever leave the place ? " " The men , never . The women , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd frankly prefer you stay in the deathly hole . " He thought she would be exasperated , or smile ; but she would not receive the remark , and it remained between them . He went straight on , with a consciousness of fatal timing : " My own work is not like that . It 's necessary to me , and lucky . Yet you are as necessary to my life as knowledge is to my work , and I 've not been lucky in this , and God knows I will never be truly whole or fortunate without you . " " People ca n't be possessed like information . " She was not combative , or even agitated . She was calm from some great resource of joy , achieved and anticipated , that could only be love . The discovery was like violence in the pink , trivial , and fairly harmless room that had known no greater upheaval , until now , than a crash of flowered crockery . He saw that it could not be new . But she had grown careless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had the assurance of an acrobat , rising to her adventure in grace and wasted courage . So it was all explained . Her hands and hair explained themselves , her forearm sloping back into a sleeve became the soft wrist of a woman in love : all of this desired and handled and awaited by someone , offered to someone . Ted dwelt on it with sickening defencelessness , a revulsion . He was certain  --  and yet afraid of an obsessive mistake  --  as to her lover 's identity . She said , " You make me unkind . " Sorry for him and unsmiling , she nevertheless sat there with that other life flowing through her ,  |p149making  her cheek rosy and his pale . He watched the glow of her flesh where it disappeared into her clothes and thought that her body , which was unknown to him , was already changing . When she looked at her watch he said uncontrollably , " Do n't go . " I 'm a bit late already . " Like a detective he noted callousness , the lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can do to alter or stop any of it . She can destroy me and there is nothing I can do . I ca n't prevent her from sleeping with her lover this night , or from loving it and him . The incapacity was unfairly shameful to him , like sexual impotence , and was bound up with some immense , contingent humiliation  --  perhaps the helplessness of all humanity to foretell or shield themselves from chaos . When they . parted he got a cab to Liverpool Street , where he waited an hour for his train , unable to read or to telephone a friend he had promised to call . The roof of the station made a sky of leaded grime , its girders and fittings insoluble . On the platforms , people milled like refugees . Ted Tice revolved and revolved the same impressions , while the same slogans intersected them from billboards . The refusal of time to pass was stupefying , and he recorded , with no detachment , the multiplication of moments in that hour . Squalor intensified , the waiting passengers appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ever had been . From his dirty bench he watched them as they scurried or loitered , characters from Realism without self-doubt or remorse , and with no sensations worthy of his tears . Climbing at last on board his train , Ted Tice wished all loving at an end if this was a sample . " Hullo . " From a habit that characterizes nurtured love , or resentment , Paul seldom now used Caro 's name . " The car 's round the corner . " Coming through grey streets , Caro had forgotten Ted Tice ; and in her mind already told Paul , I am so happy to see you . Back that day from a fortnight in Italy , Paul was sunburned . Men and women passing glanced at him for his expensive , imported health , and at them both for the pair they made . This had been thep150case when they first walked together , on a country road . Paul 's presence , unlike Ted 's , caused people to forget rather than recall themselves . In addition , Paul , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by strangers . When they were in the car , Paul took her wrist a moment . Caro asked , " How was Rome ? " " Baroque . " A grim drizzle misted the windshield . " This morning I was sitting in sunshine on the Pincio . " " A shame to leave . " She would have said , I am so happy to see you . He smiled , " What a stately mood you 're in . " Paul drove carefully , stopping to let a trio of schoolboys cross . The children tipped their caps to Caro , as they had been taught . Paul said , " They think you 're Queen Mary . " " Surely I would n't be in front with the chauffeur . " " Now listen , you must be sweet to me because today , within an hour of my return , I had an unexpected approach . " He said a name and , when Caro showed ignorance , went on in irritation , " The only important director to come forward in the last ten years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owning up : " Would anyone answering to the description please come forward ? " " Unless someone comes forward , the entire school must remain after class . " As if this important man  --  whom Caro now identified from press reports  --  were somehow willing to take the blame . By the time Paul had told his story , they had reached Covent Garden and left the car . In an hour or two , in his own house , he would tell it all again to Tertia ; who , having married a man of pledged renown , would receive it as part of her due . They went up Caro 's stairs . Paul now had a key of his own . Turning it in the lock , he said , " It 's now you must be sweet to me . " But was clearly invincible this evening , and distracted by tributes paid . It was useless to attempt reversal , to propose one 's own mood to Paul  --  who so hated to feel himself under direction that he sometimes could not tolerate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caro , by looking her best , should seem to compel his interest . The lightest claim on his affinities might be repudiated with savage energy , like a threat , when he was in that beleaguered frame of mind.  |p151Striking  out in this way , he might also , on occasion , accidentally wound himself . Caro lay dressed on the bed , and Paul sat beside her , preoccupied . His hand rotated on her breast , but from force of kindly habit , absently fondling a domestic pet . On the coverlet her own hand lay open , upturned , extended to a fortune-teller . She watched him with love that was like a loss of consciousness . Paul was thinking of the play he might write for the man who had unexpectedly come forward . " It 's hard to surprise anybody now . I do n't mean it in a cheap sense . The lack of ' surprise that develops with age , in individuals , has now occurred in an entire population . I suppose it began with the First World War . Why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything by now ? " " You could still be surprised at the person who does it . Someone you know well might still surprise you with an action that was monstrous , or noble . " " Even then , love or hate can take the edge off it . " This evening Paul was impartial , even clinical , regarding hate and love . The world , in being sweet to him , had met his desires for that day , and his present energies were channelled in such a way that sexual gratification itself was sublimation . " The ability to surprise is a form of independence . And proprietary feeling can be so strong that it will not concede such a revelation . " Caro said , with no strategy of surprise , " Ted and I were talking about possessiveness . I had tea with Ted Tice . " Paul made no answer . But an hour later remarked , " It is hard to be interested in Tice . " Perhaps Ted Tice had never left his mind . He got up and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaving . " " Going home . " " You can save some man from this , " he said , " by not marrying him . " Being quick with the socks and shirts , he hummed with intention  --  a machine switched on if not yet in operation . He sat again on the bed beside her . " Do you know that Russians always sit down for a moment before departure ? " " That 's the only time you sit down . " " My God . Complaining like the classic mistress . " He knew she would never hold out against the suggestion that she might begin to get on his nerves . He had no wish that she should be secure in his love ; and might have held it was recurring loss that bound them.  | " But I am the classic mistress . " He held both her hands . This gave an impression of restraining her from doing harm . " Do n't be censorious . You look like a schoolteacher . " " The Classics mistress . " They both laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us ? " " Who can tell ? " This produced resentful fear  --  as if a trusted surgeon suddenly came out with " Now it 's up to Nature , " or " We 're in the hands of the Lord . " As Paul had pledged eminence to Tertia , so he had promised mastery to Caro ; and , now that he finally exerted it , must not recant . His marriage vow that evening was the stronger . Caro 's timing was fatally insistent as Ted 's : " There must be an end somewhere to deception . Ultimately there must be the truth . " " And do you think the human need to deceive is not also part of truth ? " " Of reality , not truth . " Paul said , " We need a theologian and a semanticist to settle that . " He smiled , still holding her hands . " I 'm glad they 're not here . " And went on , most reasonably , " These days you want all the cards on the table . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It was this I was capable of . " Love had become her greatest , or sole , distinction . " Not all capacity is adverse , like ' capable of murder . ' " He released her hands , with a show of resignation : restraints were useless , she might commit violence in any case . " I mean , you used to amaze me . " " How shall I amaze you now ? " Since she was obliged to keep his existence at a certain pitch . He laughed . " Tell me something interesting about Tice . " A silence that was also a faltering made the moment interesting . To the woman , the hiatus was a sensation remembered . One summer , helping in the garden at Peverel , she had picked up a dead rat , or rabbit , on a spade : a weight differently inanimate from that which had never had life . " Well ? " He did not so much want disclosure as to intrude on whatever virtue she privately retained . Which might be nothingp153more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well then , Scheherazade ? " Paul flung down his jacket and lay again at Caro 's side . And she told him how Edmund Tice had spared the German scientist who was his enemy . Paul Ivory wrote to his mother : My dear Monica , How wise you are to stay on in Barbados . We have had four ( patriots might claim five ) fine days since you left . The summer being now over , England has little to look forward to , ever . Actually , I like this season , whiteish stubble in fields and the woods beginning to go rusty . From which you 'll gather I 've been in the country , staying a few days with Gavin and Elise . My sister-in-law continues to take over  --  while Gavin is speaking she explains , ad alta voce , what he really means . It is like a film with subtitles . This in fact gave me the germ of a play  --  the eclipse of a man who takes up with a woman of character , even of genius ( patently not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might call it " The One Flesh . " In consequence I 've been pondering such phantasmata as Messieurs Recamier , de Stael , de Sevigne , and Mr. Humphry Ward . What do you think ? Of course I do n't know what it would demonstrate  --  probably nothing more than that , on any terms , marriage is hell . Your informant , or informer , was accurate in thinking she saw me at the opening of the Pinero revival . A bad play : I had been told it could not be overlooked , but think it should have been . Afterwards there was a party , at which the prime minister briefly appeared , looking very ill : the Sea-Green Corruptible . Your friend was also correct in reporting that I have been seen with the same woman on a number of recent , and less recent , occasions . I should have thought this constancy would reassure rather than disturb you . As Lord Byron wrote  --  though not , I think , to his mother  --  " I have not had a whore this half-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving son Caro stood by the windows of Paul 's bedroom while Paul , at the fireplace , fiddled , not nervously , with an obelisk of rose-veined marble . Tertia Ivory was pregnant . Tertia was at the castle : gravid Tertia in her fastness . Hold fast , the race is to the swift . Somewhere beyond Paul Ivory 's city roomp154a landscape shimmered , the castle swelling on its impregnable ancestralrise . Paul said , " You knew the probabilities at the outset . " To exclude love was to fortify himself . He owed this much to his legitimate descendants . To discover how passion could debilitate , you need only look at Caro . She said , " I did n't realize you would take so much . Or that I would give it . " Both these statements were false . Her mouth turned clumsy with incomprehension , with comprehension . Her body , motionless , expressed an unlovely struggle . " Is n't that your temperament , though ? " Disengaging , if not quite blaming : a doctor who ascribes to emotional causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is hard . " Paul was lenient , indulging the offence of love . " Hard ? " She might never have heard this sour word . Paul had told himself he would have to go through a bad time with her , and had certainly taken into account her point of view . He dreaded the bad time as one dreads process , not outcome . His mother had once said to him , " The truly terrible things are those one can not alter , to which one is indefinitely committed . " ( She might have said " endlessly , " though that was not her style . ) Paul 's present suffering was not of that doomed kind . He could foresee an end to Caro . Paul 's bedroom had long been completely furnished  --  rugs spread , chairs stationed , pictures hung , and curtains parted on a pot of white , clothy flowers at one window . Everything was maintained in perfect order  --  although , by an oversight , the flowers sometimes shed gold particles of dust . On the dressing-table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even antiquated , kind , each embellished with a crest . In the closet there would be Tertia 's clothes , which now , for a while , she would not wear . These objects were precise , and glittered ; or became blurred ; or altogether ceased to exist , while the man and woman stood there . Paul remained by the fireplace in expectation of Caro 's outburst . He did not like to be kept waiting . The coming storm would set him at liberty : what she was to say of him , to him , would put her in the everlasting wrong . His escape was assured by the degrading violence of her pending emotion.  | " Now I 'm off , " she said . He helped her on with her jacket . His conventional , unblessed touch was the true dismissal . Composure in others always thwarted him , and hers at that moment denied him the offence of a scene . That he had loved Caro more , and far more , than he had cared for anyone else gave her stature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resented this historic position she had established for herself in the momentum of his life , and because of it would have liked to see her broken . She glanced at the room , not to be seen looking for the last time . Nothing testified to her presence . Her eyes rested on Paul with a darker questioning than he had ever endured ; and he turned away , not to be tempted to some acknowledgment he himself might fear . They went downstairs in single file , both of them recalling the earlier scene on the landing ; Paul imagining his own huge hand , the whip hand , a shadow on the wall . Seeing also , in his mind , her dun raincoat and the folds of scarlet parted at her breast . It was from this time onward that the image would recur to him  --  vivid enough at that moment to make him almost doubt that Caro 's present face looked out from a dim mirror in the hall , a face the colour of nakedness : the new Caro he had created , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth was a wound that might never heal . Merely by standingat her side he could yet hope to provoke the storm of tears that would formally release him , like a dissolution of vows . He had never seen her cry , except for joy . And in perfect obedience to his wishes , as to a law of Nature , Caroline Bell made a primitive gesture of bereavement , and spoke his name . And wept aloud without so much as covering her face.  |p156I  am more sorry than I can say , " Mrs. Pomfret 's letter began , " to be the bearer of bad news , or tidings . But feel you would want to know . " The Major had left , or abandoned , Dora . And , since he now declared himself insolvent , was providing no support . Dora was remaining in the Algarve flat to establish possession , but was otherwisewithout funds . It seemed that Dora 's capital had unfortunately been transferred to the Major 's name at an early stage of the marriage , and was quite irretrievable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best lawyer of the province . " Her main concern is that you should continue happy and not be bothered by this . You know , even better than I , her fierce pride . But her state is pitiful and I told her flatly I would write to you as above . Without wishing to worry you unduly , I obviously have a duty to let you know that she has spoken , and more than once , of taking her life . " Caro telephoned Christian at his office , because Grace was expectingher second child . When she had read him the letter , Christianwas silent awhile before saying , " This could have been fore-seen . " Caro the culprit . " Is there anything to be done through the embassy ? " " I have made it a firm policy not to mix the official and the personal . Not to abuse , that is , my position . " It was Caro 's turn for silence . Christian soon resumed , " I 'm sure you see that . " In his admonishing formality he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscene absence of decency caused childhood panic , as if ap157lavatory door-handle would not turn . " You have nothing to sug-gest ? " " I scarcely see how I can intervene at this stage . Without knowingmore . " In the space now constructed for the utterance , Caro said , " Then I will go . " That exacted , Christian became cordial with relief . " It does seem best , if you can swing it . What a shambles . I 'll talk to Grace tonight and call you back first thing . " That evening he told Grace , " Your sister is more trouble than a barrel-load of monkeys . " And added , " I mean Dora . " Grace was shivering . " What will she do , without money ? " " Get a job , like millions of other women . Take her mind off herself for a change . It could be the making of her . " But the making of Dora had occurred long since . " She would not be good in an office . " Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been for the damfool nonsense of handing over your own money to her , this would n't arise . " Grace sat shuddering , and Christian got up and loped about the room . Tall men with thin shoulders begin to stoop comparativelyearly . " Handing it over . On a platter . Just like that . " He picked up and flung down a coloured magazine , by way of illustration . " I always thought it insane . " " Caro gave up everything . " " That was daft enough , but her business . It 's involving you in it that I resent . " Grace had drawn her legs beneath her on the sofa and looked thoroughly misshapen . " That 's unjust . I 'm as much "  --  she nearly said " to blame "  --  " in it as she . It was Caro made me keep half . " " Very magnanimous , since the entire thing was her idea . " " No . " " Allow me to refresh your memory . You particularly told me . " Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had been rehearsed for years . " Besides , it 's just like her . She has this notion of herself . " " What notion ? " As if she did not know . " Of being different . Or better . Sees herself making large gestures . " Derisory whirl of hand and arm . Christian might have respectedthe characteristic in a person of acknowledged standing ; butp158who was Caro  --  an Australian who had worked in a shop  --  to be high-minded ? " Rank egotism . " Unsure what this use of the word " rank " conveyed , he added , " Delusions of grandeur . " " There must be worse delusions than that . " Grace did not have the vocabulary for argument and was only aware , confusedly , that there was general dislike of any person with a sense of destiny  --  even when destiny was little more than a show of preferences . The Thrales stared at their cream-coloured rug , their brocade chairs , and the Staffordshire figure of Dick Turpin , from all of which enchantment had unaccountably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office ? " " She must have some holiday saved up . " " Only a few days . And she was going to France . " " I 'm sorry , but Caro will just have to learn she ca n't do every-thing . " " What about money ? How will she pay the fare ? Her salary is almost nothing . And then there 's Dora . " Christian came and sat beside her in a chair . " Listen , Grace . You are making me out a Scrooge . A Whatnot Legree . I tell you we will do what we can when the situation is clear . Or clarified . I simply refuse to commit myself in advance , blindfold , to another of Caro 's "  --  the word he was groping for was " harebrained "  --  " wild schemes . On the phone she obviously took the fare in her stride  --  after all , it is n't much . And it 's amazing what someone like Caro often manages to salt away over the years  --  we 'd probably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibilities . We have children , which neither Caro nor Dora does . " " We are choosing to have children , for our own satisfaction . Caro has been landed with Dora , and no satisfaction . " It was an answer Caro herself might have made . " Besides , Caro will have children herself one day . " The assumption was disturbing . Christian had supposed Caro might one day marry ( he recalled the unappetizing Tice , who had behaved shabbily over the telescope ) , but had not got as far as children . In his alarm Christian could not know it was Grace 's last stand , and was ready to waver from surprise and fright . But in that moment Grace gave in , gave up , on an outburst of weak , womanly , and obliging tears . " Oh Chris , Dora will be so awful . Poor Caro . " At once he had his arms about her , and there was no need to dop159more . " Poor little Grace . " Eventually he said , " You know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while meaning flowed slowly back , like a stain , into the cream rug ; twill cushions miraculously reinflated ; and a pair of Spode plates , mounted on a wall , renewed their encircling spell . Grace said , " I suppose Dora will come back to England . " Christian would not announce it yet , but was determined that when Dora returned to London she should be sheltered by Caro . It was only logical , two working girls , a saving in rent , and so forth . He was as unshakably and righteously resolved on this as if it had been a moral cause or high ideal . It would have surprised him to think he was avenging himself for the spectre of Caro 's fecund marriage . After dinner , Christian sat reading in his habitual chair , his feet propped on a cushioned stool . This was his custom in the evening  --  not quite recreation but an interval between working days . And in fact , in that position , shafts tipped in air , he somewhat resembled an unharnessed cart or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  holding a book that seemed , fetchingly , too heavy for her  --  suddenly began again to cry . Christian came and sat by her . " Please do n't say things like that to me , please do n't . " " Like what , for heaven 's sake ? " She clutched the book and sobbed without control . " Like allow me to refresh your memory . " In the morning the administrative officer , Mr. Leadbetter , told Caro , " I fear I must deny your request for compassionate leave . " It was among Mr. Leadbetter 's functions to guard the department 's slender store of compassion . Caro was silent . " I see , Miss Bell , that you have made your submission "  --  he took up a yellow paper  --  " as a matter of urgency . " He read over a paragraph or two of the application . " I am of course sorry that your sister , or half-sister rather , has domestic difficulties . But if we made one exception we would naturally be in no position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's unwindowed cubicle was like an enlarged elevator  --  one of those that in a hospital accommodates stretcher cases , or , in a museum , transports statuary . In this case , the space was occupiedmainly by a metal desk , and Leadbetter appeared as the desk 's attendant or custodian : Going Down ? I le held the document , ap160yellow targe at his breast . His hair was prematurely grey with anticipation of his pension . " I am sure you see that ? " Caro 's silences were giving annoyance in these days . " The arrangement is intended for emergencies  --  ill health , say , of parents or a spouse . Or , of course , decease . " Although she had Mrs. Pomfret 's letter in her handbag , it would have been cheating to bring up Dora 's everlasting death . " Besides , Miss Bell , you do have annual leave accruing . " Leadbetterconsulted another paper . " Allow me to refresh your memory . One week has in fact accrued . I suggest you ask your supervisor whether you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now he had disposed of her , and without broaching the small , costly and heavily rationed fund of official compassion , he grew , like Christian , quite solicitous . " I trust you will be able to settle matters to your satisfaction . " When Christian telephoned , Caro said , " I have some annual leave . Accruing . " At lunchtime Caro took out a loan at the bank , using her pension as security . She drew a salary advance , and bought escudos . When she got back to the office Valda told her , " A man called . " Expectation of Christian made Caro aloof even to Valda . But when she took up the written message she found that Ted Tice was in town for the day . In the evening Ted drove her to the airport . He had a small secondhand car that became silent on the smallest rise . In the car he asked , " Do you have money for this ? " " I dug some up . " Planes were loud and low in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were electric advertisements for soft drinks and boot polish . In the changing lights , Ted 's profile shone green , then red and blue . " Because if you need anything , ever , you need only tell me . " " Edmund Le Gentil . " " My fear is , you will never need anything that I can provide . " He neither wished to impute high motives to his anxiety for her nor to underrate a selflessness inseparable from love . He had seen how people grew cruel with telling themselves of their own compassion : nothing made you harder than that . He said , " Caro , when will you let me deliver you from these awful people ? " She could scarcely bear it , that Grace might he included.  |p161Ted  Tice was observing suffering that had nothing to do with Dora . Caro 's flesh was no longer luminous . Her body had grown so slender it was impossible to imagine the strength that must still be there . These changes gave him no hope , for in her misery she belonged as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never ceased to marvel at the waste . On each side , so much high feeling , and none of it transferable . He said , " Today is my thirtieth birthday . If I 'm not young soon , I never shall be . " He was saying he would accept any terms . " Also today the final decision was made to put that telescope in Sussex . " At the departure gate he kissed her . It was the first time he had ever embraced her and seemed hardly to matter , her substance being neutralized by grief . In his arms her body was light and dispassionate as a dress . A bus that left Lisbon at daylight brought Caro through foreign fields to a provincial city . Countryside gave way to new residential blocks and to streets busy with morning . Pavements were being hosed , shutters flung up or apart . The sun was not yet warm , the mild air still free of fumes . Along every curb , parked cars , like pack animals , waited to start . The most prosaic shop-window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coloured tiers , was a pagan altar . The block of flats in Rua das Flores was called The Chisholm and might have been at Hammersmith . Dora lay on a twin bed , a sodden bundle . One averted one 's eyes from the empty bed alongside , as from an open coffin . " I gave him everything , that 's why he hates me . Everyone has always hated me . You hate me too . Why have I gone on . Why . But this is the end now , at last . " You could certainly hear her through the wall . Caro came and went to the kitchen , the bathroom , bringing aspirins and tea , and a brioche she had bought across the road . Dora 's face was a skull , the eye sockets crimson : a boiled wooden doll from an exhibit , the first doll ever made in colonial Australia . Sometimes she thrashed , at times was inert . Once she gave a scream like a flash of lightning . " I will be better dead . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Caro brought the tray . " Did you get this from the place across the road ? " When she had the tea she sat up against a soaked pillow and atp162every question thumped her head from side to side . Her dark hair hung down in mad long tangles . " Everything gone . I have nothing . Ca n't you grasp that ? " She would tolerate no denial . " I 'm telling you , there 's nothing , it has all gone . You can ask Ernesto Prata . Who is , " she added on another shriek of tears , " the best man in the province . " Her head banged sideways on the pillow , as against a wall . Caro changed the pillowslip . She made scrambled eggs . In the kitchen , leaned her forehead against a cabinet of pink Formica . " Do n't worry , " Dora called from the bedroom . " I wo n't bother you for long . " Later that morning Caro telephoned Mrs. Pomfret , who said she would be round at tea-time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living-room sofa , a brown bag of sweets at her side . " You 'll be all right once I 'm gone . " Caro stood out on a narrow balcony . In the foreground , televisionaerials were Chinese calligraphy , were a fretwork of masts and rigging in an ancient port . Beyond the brick apartments and the bungalows , a glade was green in the wasted morning . To the right of the golf course , an old garden glowed like civilization . In the orchards , almond trees remote as happy memories . She thought how she had betrayed Ted Tice 's secret to Paul Ivory , and that Paul had later said to her , " What a good turn you did me , telling me that . " There was nothing here to hinder her from thinking the worst of herself . " Can you imagine for one single moment what it means to look for work at my age ? " Caro came inside . " I work . " " You 're young . " Dora 's head was vehement again . " Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I too am alone . " " You have friends . " " You have Mrs. Pomfret , here . " Dora said , " It 's funny how I always manage to attract the one or two . Who take to me . I do n't know why . " She allowed Caro to draw the comb through her hair . " What I would have done without Glad Pomfret I do n't know . The only one . " Glad Pomfret had come round within an hour of the Major 's departure , although it was her Bridge day . " I 've never had anyone to do that for me . Itp163does n't seem much to you , but . " Glad Pomfret had known from the first what he was , but hesitated to interfere . Glad 's own husband had been a handful himself , but was dead . " Cancer of the heart . " " I 've never heard of that . " " The right ventricle . He was a big man , " said Dora , " but at the end shrivelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a hospital bed , a swag of deflated rubber . Dora had an ability to bring deliquescence before your eyes . " They opened him up but he was riddled . In no time he was gone . " Dora sighed . " Those are the lucky ones . " Caro said , " Mrs. Pomfret is bringing a Miss Morphew . " " I do n't trust Gwen Morphew . " Dora bent her head so that Caro could make the coil at the nape . " That 's Glad 's paid companion . " Ernesto Prata , Glad Pomfret , Gwen Morphew , they were like the cast of a play . On the other hand , the Major had become , simply , he . " He took the antiques , the pieces . He even took the wireless . If you could have seen his face . The cruelty of him . The cruelty . " " Dora , do n't cry any more . Your poor eyes . " But Dora was hooting for the cruelty . " I 'd put nothing past him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caro sat with her arms about Dora , and for two pins would have resumed long past pleadings : Please Dora , oh Dora do n't . In any embrace , Dora would apply her stranglehold . Caro , whatever her frailty , was now irrevocably cast as the strong one who overcame without effort ; Dora would be the victim , and pitifully weak . There was no reversal of roles in this , only a change of tactics . They had made the exchange in mid-air , as two mountaineers pass between them , at the critical instant , the rope that hoists them to the ledge . " This awful place . So alone . If only we could get back to Sydney , " Dora was howling , " where we were all so happy . " Tranquillityrecollected in emotion . After a while she said , " At least Grace had the sense to keep half . " It was Dora 's only reference to the sisters ' loss in the debacle : Grace was respected for her foresight , Caro had been the fool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reliable , someone to turn to . I 've never had anyone to turn to . Not one . " In making a fool of Caro over the transfer of the money , Fate hadp164aligned itself on the side of avarice and calculation . Fate had teamed up with the Major , Christian , and Clive Leadbetter , and the righteoushad been forsaken . Caro had to wonder at it , the unfairness . Mrs. Pomfret came at four , in a large dress of turquoise wool with matching turban . There was a cameo among folds . Miss Morphewwas lean , slate-coloured , and had a slight tremor . " Ernesto Prata is my own man , " Glad Pomfret said ; meaning lawyer . And the best in the region . " Mrs. Pomfret preferred a straight chair because of fused vertebrae . Caro brought more tea and the remains of the brioche , along with some macaroons found in a tin . A quartet of white doves , released from a garden , wheeled outside the windows . Dora observed that pigeons were said to carry viral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Dora while this is being settled ? " Mrs. Pomfret pursed , pessimistic . " It is a pity she never picked up the language . Even though circumstances are different , I have picked it up . " She uttered the expressions for good morning , good evening . " It is not all that hard to pick up . " Portuguese might have been viral hepatitis , or some object by the wayside for anyone 's casual lifting . Mrs. P. settled turquoise folds . " Even Miss Morphew has picked it up . " Looking aggrieved in a new way , Dora said from the sofa , " I read somewhere you could n't learn a new language after thirty . Not properly . " Mrs. Pomfret told Caro , " Naturally , Dora does not hope for a career like yours . " Caro struck out hopelessly : " I am an ill-paid clerk , in a dull office . " Mrs. Pomfret 's smile was sadness itself . " That seems , you see , a lot to her . " Dora moaned in realization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unwise , " Mrs. Pomfret adjudged , " in signing over to him . " They had all taken up the he and him , out of deference to Dora . To so much as name Bruce Ingot would have been a declaration of treason . " A woman should never make over capital . Not even to her nearest and dearest . " Miss Morphew said , " Dora was too trusting . "  |p165Dora  whimpered . " He won me over . " It was hard to imagine the Major in wooing mood . One suspectedhe had never courted anything , except disaster . Dora wailed , " Forget me . I am determined to trouble no one . " Miss Morphew helped Caro take away the dishes . In the kitchen , she ran the tap and said , without looking in Caro 's direction , " Prata is in with the Major . Try Salgado in Rua do Bomjardim . " When Dora got her settlement she stayed on in the Algarve throughout the winter . " I long to leave this awful place , as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these unspeakable people . Thank heaven England still stands for something . But might as well get the winter out of it here , as I will never see it again . Also , it is advisable to stick it out till spring , since I do not trust Manoel Salgado . " Later she wrote that she had reached breaking-point with regard to Glad Pomfret . The main thing was that Caro should continue perfectly happy . Christian said , " I was sure something would be worked out . " Mr. Leadbetter , meeting Caro in the corridor , reminded her that his door was always open . One Sunday afternoon Nicholas Cartledge telephoned Caroline Bell . " Am I never to see you again ? " " No . " " I 've tried you a number of times . " " I was in Portugal last month . " " Lucky you . "  |p166On  winter evenings and weekends , Caroline Bell walked through the city alone , in labyrinthine suburbs to the north or south . From these expeditions  --  which never lacked an expectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Ivory  --  she would return home , perhaps wet , always cold . And , removing her shoes , stand in the kitchen trying to warm herself by the stove . Repayment of the bank loan had done away with heat for the winter . She understood how people had burned fine furniture duringwinters of the war . She understood why men spoke to her in the streets . She understood many acts of destruction and survival formerly incomprehensible . She stood in the kitchen and thought , What a cold country . Caro lay in her frozen bed and stared at the skylight , which was a sheet of clotted ice . She lay in darkness or in moonlight , rememberinghow , one evening of the previous year , she had come in from work to find Paul sitting at her table writing ; and that he had got up and embraced her and asked , " How does it strike you , to find a light on and someone waiting for you ? " He had put his mouth to her hair and said , " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Caro whom , for his convenience , he wished away . Love had not been innocent . It was strange that suffering should seem so . Her mind shifted uselessly on silence , ravening as much to give as to receive . A sense of waste made incredulous tension in eyes and breasts and stomach . Her mind shifted on silence , like a ship on the disc of ocean that represents the globe . Caro , on her knees , said , " Christ . " Possibilities of mercy werep167remote . God was powerless , only Paul could extend mercy . God had nothing to propose but a relinquishing that amounted to her own disintegration . Or there was death , which made no commotion but from time to time broke the silence with a bronze reverberation . On the child Caro , Dora Bell had inculcated a moral obligation to find the world abominable and to speak readily of doing away with oneself in protest . This corruption was now reconsidered by Caro the woman as , possibly , a cheap rendering of sacred truth . For Dora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence . For Caro , a single death , unadvertised , would suffice . Like Paul , to whom there were other resemblances , death had its own key and awaited Caro 's return at evening . Its unpresentable spectre must be socially got round when there were visitors  --  whose dull , rational , living exchanges seemed the manifestations of a normality grotesquely uninformed , piteous as the flowered wallpaperin a gutted building or the piano intact in a blitzed and roofless room . There was the afternoon , the Sunday afternoon when Cartledge telephoned : " Lucky you . " Callousness was of course immeasurable . Caro herself had walked with Paul in a graveyard and joked about suicides . She lay on her unconsecrated bed and wondered , " Did I come here to die ? " Caroline Bell watched the room dwindle in the early dark . The skylight made a gash of paler grey . I had a dream that I was lying on a long slope , and a great stone , greater than the stones at Avebury , rolled down at me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not afraid . When it got close , I turned my face to it as if to a pillow , as if to rest at last . A pathos as bad as if it were someone else 's death . Confuses the issue . No issue , died without issue . Once , for two weeks , thought I was to bear Paul 's child , and feared to tell him . The deed of death has no hypothetical existence  --  or , having its hypothesis in everyone , must be enacted to achieve meaning . Then meaning is total , as for nothing else . A phenomenon known as the Black Drop . It is no less than logical . There are dying conditions as well as living conditions . Venus can blot out the sun . Do n't remember coming out here in the hall . So terribly hot.  |p168Was  it impossible then ? No longer like someone else 's death , now it is like my own . No more thoughts , thing itself , itself . Darkness what darkness , and I have not even . Returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Major Ingot . Taking it upstairs she put it on the table while she lit the gas for her dinner , then sat down to read it . She kept her coat on because of cold . The Major asked that a compromise be arranged . Otherwise , prospects were dim for keeping body and soul together . " I do n't have your advantages , " the Major wrote . And " Day after day , it was a tongue-lashing or the waterworks . Or both , like as not . Cry , you 've never seen anything to equal it . You 'd not believe , you ca n't imagine . She was all for dying one day , disappearing the next , till I 'd half a mind to take her up on it , and no error . " In extremity , the Major 's social pretensions had dissolved , or perhaps he believed the unaffected idiom might touch Caro . The Major could not know his timing was badly off . Caro gave the letter to Christian , who told her he would soon settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am going to drop a word through the embassy . After all , there are some benefits in having access to official channels . " When the spring came , Dora took a cruise to Capetown with a new friend , Meg Shentall , whom she had met in the Algarve in a tearoom called The Lusitania . In a park without flower-beds or streams , on undulations of November leaves , Caro was walking alone . Branches fissured a white sky , the bark on ancient trees was corded like sinews of a strong old man . On a free afternoon given in recompense for late office hours , Caro had come there without purpose , scarcely noticing the intervening streets crossed in her mute private delirium . Inside the park , lack of intention struck her wretchedly and she grew physically uneasy , ears aching from cold , feet slipping on dun leaves . The smell of earth was decayed , eternal . Flat colours offended , a dreariness full blown : Nature caught in an act of erasure . She stood on the path , shoulders narrowed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching . And might have beenp169taken for a woman aghast at some cruel spectacle . But the single person approaching was reading a letter and had not yet seen her . That Paul and Caro should meet in such a way , by accident , might appear the calculated act of a fate that preyed on helpless lives . What would in retrospect be made reasonable  --  since they had occasionally met by chance when they were lovers , and the park was familiar territory  --  at that instant amazed with predestination . In this they were both egotistical and humble  --  the two of them facing each other on the ceremonious avenue , the leaves shifting and drifting on the ground or inertly falling ; the senile bark , the pinched white light . Paul came on , of a colour with the pale scene  --  hair , light coat , trouser legs . Caro lowered her hands from her bare head , but he had already seen her in that attitude and took it to refer to himself , her gesture of apparent terror . Paul was coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The document he held was a contract , in which magic formulas  --  " hereinafter referred to as , " or " payable in United States dollars "  --  assured his safety . Through these defences Caro broke like whiteness or darkness , elemental . Ile saw two things distinct on her face : that , having perpetually conjured the sight of him in fancy , she could not be sure this was he and almost thought herself deranged ; and that she feared to exasperate him with this meeting that was none of her doing  --  that he might say to her , Am I never to be free of you ? Her very silence was the speechless dread of displeasing . As a man might imagine a clothed woman naked , so in that moment Paul saw Caro nearly unfleshed , her disclosed pulses tremulous as the cranium of a newbornchild . Her fear , or rapture , pierced him with unusual shame , as if the encounter exposed him in a colossal lie ; as if this meeting itself were truth . Observing them , one would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man with the paper rolled in his hand , the woman waiting . You would certainly have imagined a meeting , rather than the farewell of which they were trying to be worthy . They could have sat on a bench , or on the damp leaves pitched up here and there in burial mounds . Had they sat , however , would have touched ; and some reticence , you could scarcely call it honour , deterred Paul from this . Ile held the contract , clenched and now forgotten  --  though unclenched , later , it might again becomep170imperative  --  and made a slight gesture . And perhaps spoke , saying " Caro . " While she looked from the daunting stature of her agony . They were converging from extremes , two opposing commanders who meet while their forces slaughter , not to make peace but to exchange a high , knowing , egoistic sadness before resuming battle : two minutes ' silence , their brief armistice . At a distance , a woman in a raincoat stooped to let a dog off a red leash  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounded up to them and stood gasping and with legs wide , awaiting orders . Even this dog , to whom the deathly park was paradise , stared , noting what was not usual . Though the dog pranced from side to side , they were not drawn . The dog then barked a bit , reproving all who are not kind to animals . And the owner called , " Split ! Split ! " Paul and Caro were moving slowly along the path , while the dog scampered round their circumspection , circling it like a quarry before losing interest and loping off to be releashed . They were two persons who conduct themselves well in some outrage ; who rise above . Trees moved past them in procession . Standing by elaborate though open gates , Caroline Bell had her hands in the pockets of her coat and , as far as she willed anything , wished to stay in the park , which had become a core of endurance now and her enclosure . Standing , she was again conscious of sore ears , although her body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blood . It was simplest to stand , and be free of explanations . The dog had found a dead rat , or mole , and was snuffling . Leaving the park , Paul walked the length of the Mall , then took a cab home . In his hallway he put the contract down , with its creased guarantees , on a table and hung his coat on a stand . The living-room was pallid as the cold sky  --  walls , carpet , and chairs all of the bleached condition called neutral . Two small Sisleys , hooded by strip-lights explicit as price-tags , were drained of colour as if left out in the rain . In this ashen room , Paul 's wife sat on a window-seat , looking out through what might , or might not , have been a glaze of tears . " Tertia , " he said  --  quite gently for anyone , let alone Paul.  |p171n  her room Caroline Bell would fall into long reverie , rememberingthough not pondering sights , episodes , and sensations , or lines she had read ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . She was coming to look on men and women as fellow-survivors : well-dissemblers of their woes , who , with few signals of grief , had contained , assimilated , or put to use their own destruction . Of those who had endured the worst , not all behaved nobly or consistently . But all , involuntarily , became part of some deeper assertion of life . Though the dissolution of love created no heroes , the process itself required some heroism . There was the risk that endurance might appear enough of an achievement . This risk had come up before . ( At the age of nineteen , Caro  --  travelling in Spain as a nursemaid  --  had spent a week at Granada with the young and antiquated English family who employed her . A wide balcony ran the length of their hotel near the Alhambra , looking out to the Sierra Nevada . Directly below this terrace there was a steep drop to the town on the valley floor . On crystal mornings and ripe afternoons the hotel guests would sit out on long chairs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rugs to be brought to them , or cups of tea on trays . They would turn pages of books from the hotel 's librarywhere titles and authors , long forgotten in their own countries , clung on in exile . The sanatorium atmosphere was not dispelled by the proximity of Moorish monuments and gardens of perfect roses . It was as if you had died and gone to heaven . At dinner in the Edwardian dining-room  --  where Cam 's em/ployer sometimes noted , on his starched , projecting cuff , the years of wines or names of dishes , or might scribble his suite number on the broached bottle of sherry  --  there was a trio that played , in an alcove , so discreetly than even gipsy selections turned demure . Each evening , between the entree and the pastel , this trio of piano , violin , and cello would go sadly , softly through Adelaide , Caprice Viennois , and Schumann 's Arabeske ; resuming , with the coffee , with a selection from The Land of Smiles . And a handful of guests would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed so that she faced the cellist  --  a woman of thirty or so with white skin that , contrasting at throat and wrists with black crepe , suggested the pallor of torso beneath a dress voluminousas a nun 's . This woman was passing visibly from Madonna youth to dedicated spinsterhood in calm renunciation . Once in a while her dark eyes would meet Caro 's with melancholy , recognizingtenderness , as if to affirm a bond . As if to state : You and I will make no part of that enervating and degrading struggle . Each evening the cellist 's gentle confidence in Caroline Bell 's willingness to waive her claim on destiny cast its pall . Later , in her hotel room , the girl would stare in the mirror to discover why she had been picked out as a kindred soul . In some moods , a dispiriting response raised the prospect of solitary , chaste , ineffectual decades . At other times a vital , coloured image in the mirror obliterated the cellist 's pale acquiescence and the threat of the waxen body in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone rang at Christian Thrale 's bedside , and he learned that his father had suffered a minor stroke . With perfect composure his mother gave details , while Grace raised herself on her elbow and a wakeful child called from the adjoining room . Christian said , " I 'll catch the eight-twenty . " Sefton Thrale lay in a hospital bed at Winchester , his firm expressionwithered , his carved jaw an unshaven jowl , his breath a labouredsigh . At the foot of the bed his wife stood listening to a doctor : " There is some slight impairment . " As if he were a damagedobject in a shop , his value now reduced . There was a rail at the edge of his bed like a small wicket gate . He saw the white ceiling , white counterpane ; on a table , a red tincture of anemone . Charmian came and put her hand on his : You are going to bep173well . " His eyes made some effort , a frightened child trying to be brave . The bluster of existence had ebbed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an imposture anyway . She said , " Christian will soon be here . " He knew who this was , but the name struck him as an odd choice . He remembered them all indistinctly  --  a blur of Christian , Grace , Tertia , and many others , of whom his wife was the accredited representative . All of them so fortunate , compared with this . The rich man in his castle , the poor man at his gate . When he next woke , Christian was there . Sefton Thrale rememberedthis had been promised , and was reassured by his own ability to make the recollection . He said , " I knew you . . . " and finished , on a long exhalation , " . . . were coming . " Christian , however , understood his father to say , " I knew you would come , " and was moved . His wife stood at the foot of the bed , and gently touched the outline of his feet , then covered them with a blanket . In the succeeding days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now conclusively become , revived considerably , made progress with the therapy , and began to distinguish among the nurses  --  which ones he liked , which had it in for him . When the doctors came he had small witticisms , and some complaints . Like a ball lobbed to a great height , he made his few last diminishing bounces . In compensation for , or extension of , his own feebleness , he noted signs of ageing in Christian  --  hunch of shoulders , first crescentof paunch ; and a gesture Christian had developed of passing his hand up over his face and brow , as if casting off a web . Sefton Thrale did not know why these details should give him satisfaction , but observed them with listless self-indulgence and made no effort to overlook or find them touching . The doctors had said that whatever he enjoyed was good for him . By Whitsun he was able to write an occasional note to friends . His handwriting , which had always been minuscule , enlarged with this ultimate flourish of reality . He did not ponder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit qualities in his opponents would be , by now , to recognize the wrong he had done them . He was allowed to go home in the summer , and at Peverel a nurse was engaged for the nights . It was she who found him dead one morning in September , when he had seemed over the worst . Obituaries were not as extensive as they might have been , but therep174was a distinguished funeral , and people travelled by rail from Londonto attend . The service , like a good connection , waited for the train . There was music , there were flowers . The congregation stood , knelt , and sang . And a diminutive young minister commanded a fair measure of attention with a text from Galatians , as well as the inevitable Corinthians . During other parts of the service the chancel arch was seen to be late Norman , an early example in England , and it was noted that a dry-cleaning ticket still attached itself to the coat of an usher . Tertia 's mother , some years a widow , sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turret of her tulle hat itself like the lantern of some solemn abbey or cathedral . " Even so we , when we were children , were in bondage under the elements of the world . " With this text , the life of a scientist was ingeniously eulogized , while Grace Thrale dreamily recalled the childhood bondage of bushfires , drought , the Murrumbidgee in flood , and the Southerly blowing cool over Sydney after a blazing day . She held her mother-in-law 's gloved hand , knowing that CharmianThrale allowed her to do this out of civility , so as not to seem ungrateful , but that it could seem condescending , or even a way of showing that the balance had tipped at last . Grace thought leniently of Sefton Thrale , who had been as kind to her as it was in his power to be . Lately she had seen her little boy  --  her second son , Hugh  --  take up the old man 's stick as he sat feebly in his chair ; and whirl it , swing it , toss it , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or for mankind , than for Sefton Thrale , who was abruptly gone . Now with his love , now in his colde grave . At the end of the pew , pressed against a clustered pier , Caro had set herself to remembering Robert Browning : There 's a great text in Galatians , Once you trip on it , entailsTwenty-nine distinct damnation , One sure , if another fails . These damnations were distinctly given as adultery , fornication , lasciviousness , and the like , all of which she had practised . It was a curious , almost idle thought that she was so great a sinner . Perdi/don weighed as nothing beside the laceration of departed love . Beside that , an old man 's death was a mere distraction . She leaned her cheek on frigid sandstone , as she had once , in childhood , leaned in egotistic desolation on a majolica plaque , not knowing change was at hand . " There are also celestial bodies , and bodies terrestrial : but the glory of the celestial is one , and the glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sun , and another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars : for one star differeth from another star in glory . " The congregation stood for the last time , and Sefton Thrale was over the worst for good : his mortality mitigating all , at least for a while . Poor old man . Ted Tice 's strictures now seemed too exigent . Death could so easily put the living , however rightful , in the wrong . Christian 's back was the back of a man who takes his **25;7056;TOOLONG . In commendable control , he was also seen to be so by commendable effort : already , in bearing and breathing , no longer a son . Professor Thrale left a larger estate than anyone had foreseen . Although his widow had the use of Peverel for her lifetime and an adequate income , virtually everything went to Christian , who in this way became quite well-to-do . Explaining the will to Grace , he said , " I feel we should keep it to ourselves . " He meant the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p179Girls  were getting up all over London . In striped pyjamas , in flowered Viyella nightgowns , in cotton shifts they had made themselves and unevenly hemmed , or in sheer nylon to which an old cardigan had been added for warmth , girls were pushing back bedclothes and groping for slippers . They were tying the cords of dressing-gowns and pulling pins from their hair , they were putting the shilling in the meter and the kettle on the gas ring . Those who shared were nudging each other out of the way and saying , " And it 's only Tuesday . " Those who lived alone were moaning and switching on radio or television . Some said prayers ; one sang . It is hard to say what they had least of  --  past , present , or future . I t is hard to say how or why they stood it , the cold room , the wet walk to the bus , the office in which they had no prospects and no fun . The weekends washing hair and underwear , and going in despondent pairs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done otherwise , it was their fate , decreed by Mum , Dad , and a lack of funds or gumption . Others had come from the ends of the earth to do it  --  had arrived from Auckland or Karachi or Jo'burg , having saved for years to do just this , having wrung or cajoled the wherewithalout of tear-stained parents . Not all were very young , but all , or nearly all , wished for a new dress , a boyfriend , and eventual domesticity . No two , however , were identical : which was the victoryof nature over conditioning , advertising , and the behavioural sciences -- no triumph , but an achievement against the odds . Among the awakening women , that New Year , was Caroline Bell . Caro had passed another examination and moved to another flat ,  |p180where  there were high ceilings , and draughts at long windows . Learning the address , Christian had remarked , " I did n't know there was anything cheap round there . " " It 's over a shop , " Caro told him , by way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and two chairs of her own , and a gold-coloured rug from India . In the morning she was closing one of the windows , had drawn it down and was leaning both hands on the hasps . On the inside sill there was a sprinkling of soot and flaked white paint . A branch of quince blossom , brought by Ted Tice the week before , was propped in a glass vase . Caro was standing at her second-floor window in a green dressing-gown and thinking of the women , of whom she was one  --  the women , waking yet dormant , who were getting up all over London . Across the street a man on the curb looked up at her ; looked up in the same swift , focusing way that she looked down . He appeared to have arrived at a destination , and might have been a figure in a spy story keeping watch on a fateful house : a wide , tall , motionless man in a dark-blue coat , who held a black stick and stood with feet apart and his bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , would yield to siege . She leaned , he looked . From her arched figure to his inexorable one was no great distance , and their eyes now met as they might have done in a room . There was momentary , complex stillness until , with a show of normality , Caro lifted her hands and dissolved the spell . He slightly bowed , as if he came from a graceful nation , France or Italy . They resumed their motions of interruption , crossing roads or rooms . Caro 's bare feet on the yellow carpet , Caro 's thin fingers yanking a dress from a hanger ; the man 's wide hand raised for a cab . All the girls of London shuddered , waiting for the bus . Some had knitted themselves unbecoming brown Balaclavas , with worse mittensto match . Some held a boiled egg , still hot , in their glove  --  which warmed the hand , and could be eaten cold at lunchtime in the ladies ' room . At that hour all London was ashudder , waiting for the bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputation from South America . Four exiles had come to plead for their imprisoned comrades : Let a governmental message he sent , merely a message ,  |p181|pro|posing  mercy . Pleading of this kind was not unusual when executionswere to take place in other lands . What would be unusual would be if the message were dispatched . On this occasion there were the four applicants , or supplicants , and a man from the United States who had taken up their cause . Only these five , and Caro , were punctual in the meeting-room . Northern winter overlaid the summer faces of the four exiles like sallow illness ; featureless with it , they were the more submitted to present extremity . Later on they might become distinct with eloquence , but for the present remained an amalgam , a team . Their clothes were too light , and too light-coloured , and too American , to do them any good here . Only the man from New York was well dressed , having a dark-blue coat open over a good flannel suit . It was the man from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drop his coat and stick on a spare chair . He said to Caro , " Let 's hope this is a good omen . " Again he had an easy grace , though not from a graceful nation . Eight men were to be hanged . Or shot , that was not clear . Two officials had now entered the room with their air of punctilious humanity that portended refusal . To be perfectly frank we do not feel that intervention by Her Majesty 's Government would be useful . And must also take account of the long and singularly close cooperation between our two nations . The American said that was precisely why . He was the spokesman , a public man who had founded something  --  perhaps a foundation , or it was an orchestra , or a museum , or all of these . He had lived for a time in the Latin country in question and had recently been advised , officially , not to return there . Attention was paid him here because he was wealthy and did not come from a gimcrack country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For these reasons consideration was shown him , although it was made plain he had not the authority . When he described certain tortures , the two officials became disconcerted , withdrawn , fascinated , as if he were discussing in public the act of love . His four companions were growing discernible , their faces retinged by feeling : old sepia photographs whose unnatural flush had been externally applied . One was chopped and stocky . Another , exhausted and elderly  --  leaning forward to rock his body as if in pain . The third had high-coloured Andean features , andp182shabby teeth outclassed by a gold bicuspid . The fourth , who was tall and personable , had ginger , kinky hair and the dense freckles of a freakish pigmentation . His compatriots would turn to this fourth man , making him a leader . This freckled man had large properties  --  orchards , pastures . In his case , a possibility of self-interest comforted his official hearers by introducing an element of the rational . Ted Tice had once pointed out that an independent act of humanity is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that they entreated on behalf of others . It was this that gave them an authority the authorities would never have . The one who bent forward had a huge tie-clip , shiny , dragging on a flowered tie ; and fingered this lucky charm . He had a pencil , like an unlit cigarette , between his lips ; and a cataractal rheum on both eyes , like an old dog . Caro knew there was no question of it . She had heard that yesterday : It is quite out of the question , let ourselves in for , no end to it if we once , interference in the internal affairs of , do more harm than good . There had also been a call to Washington , eliciting the reply , " Counterproductive . " " Any loss of life is always to be regretted . If only we were in a position to assist . I do not mind telling you I feel for your situation very very . Speaking on a strictly personal . I am bound to point out , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course be verified . " " Even if we produce a man with no balls ? " " Mr. Vail , you will not convince me by losing your temper . " The American sat at his ease . " You are right to reprove me . And I am right to be angry . " He made present something more than speaker and listener ; something more than mere men . What if the families of the condemned were to make a personal appeal ? Unfortunately we do not feel that would make the slightest . It was rumoured that the pope ? That is , obviously , an option of which His Holiness may choose to avail himself . We have received no indication to that effect . We did hear that the United Nations secretary-general was considering intercession.  | " Surely you are being humorous . " A silence , truthful and juridical , conveyed that sentence was pronounced . You will be taken from this court to a place of execution . The leaning Latin man sat back in his chair , as if reviving from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a dry white fleck at each corner of the mouth , and by the pencil lodged between his teeth . The stocky petitioner had his face in the light , pockmarks and capillaries visible . All four were expressionless in the irresistible silence . And the morning had gone by . The four exiles were leaving for some other last , hopeless rendezvous . Their reality intensified with defeat , dividing them conclusivelyfrom the two figmental officials who had received them . Pocked perforations and gilt tie-clips were invested with some grandeur , or stood at least for a preferable exposure . Escorting them out , an official would confide in a lowered voice , " I myself wish to God , " and so on . And then in the men 's room wash his hands and dry them on a paper towel . The man from New York was detained by a senior official . " But I 'm certain there was an arrangement about lunch . " " A misunderstanding then . " Consternation was real this time . The lunch had been with a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ring up . Please . " The supplicants had not pleaded for the lives of their martyrs with such abandon . No , unfortunately he was late for another engagement , and left . Papers must be locked in a red portfolio , and Caro stayed for this . It was also assumed she would , from a housewifely instinct in fact minimal in her , set the room to rights . She stood leaning on the conference table with damp hands , and , but for ineradicable mistrustof Dora 's antics , might have sobbed aloud . Incrimination and disgrace were growing on her , in that place , like old-maidishness ; it was like sexual frustration to be always yearning for some spasm of decency that in this context could never occur . That one 's thoughts should as much as follow four unprepossessing men into a cold street was a breach of contract here , as if a soldier in battle conjured to himself the harmless private affections of those in the opposing lines . There were rules of combat in which the victory went to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forgot this . " I its stick.  |p184He  let the heavy door click at his back , and there they were in the attitudes of the early morning . He had walked a distance before missing the stick , and brought cold fresh air with him . Though touching her fingers to her face , Caro was scarcely abashed , the morning 's episode being more shameful than tears . The wide man sat on the edge of the table , and the cold came out from his good clothes . His broad hands waited on his thighs . " Can we go out somewhere ? " They were crossing the flapping and shrieking of a street . The restaurant was upstairs , there was a pub downstairs . It was a place that was always full because tourists came to see the government eating . You 're in luck , sir , there 's been a cancellation . He might have been accustomed to luck of the kind . They sat by a window in a thin film of sunlight and Caro thought , Now he will let me down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of it too . He said , " Shits , are n't they . " And handed the menu , which was a typed slip . All the room was men , except for Caro . " When will they die ? " She meant the prisoners . " In a month or two . " She said , " Almost the worst was the panic about the lunch . " " Or the best . " He smiled . His hound-face had lines , at eyelids and mouth , that were now at rest but might be put to use . His dark hair , greying , fell loose over his forehead . His body , too heavy and indolent for the precise little chair , was that of an active man who had taught himself to wait : an incongruous patience that could trouble those who wondered what might be restrained . He said , " Men go through life telling themselves a moment must come when they will show what they 're made of . And the moment comes , and they do show . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither the moment nor the true self . " " They might at least think how soon , historically , these things recoil . My colleagues today , for instance . " " The British temperament in particular has never been one of speculation . In extremity , Archimedes went on with his theorem , but Drake went on playing bowls . " She said , " Some men  --  or many  --  are both Archimedes and the soldier who slays him . " He took the menu from her . He was something over forty . A vein corded the back of his hand . There was his watch , a cuff ofp185striped shirting , the grey flannel sleeve . He watched her following these details , which she considered as carefully as if they had dressed an arm projecting from fallen masonry : clues to the undisclosed . His name was Adam Vail . " What is your name ? " he asked . " I know your address . " Saying " address " in the American way . The two officials of the morning had inevitably entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They will make you the culprit , about the lunch . " You could see them doing it already , above the heaps of tiny fish . Not wishing to believe in any moral mastery , they were relieved to attribute something salacious . From the whitebait perspective , Vail 's arms around the table rim appeared to offer an embrace , into which Caro leaned . These two men would be saying she slept with him , and might write that in a file to relieve their feelings . From knowledge of the imagined intimacy laid on them , he and she faintly smiled , and grew intimate . At a hotel whose chimney-pots could be seen from Caro 's window , Adam Vail had two large sombre rooms with heavy curtains . In the sitting-room there were cut hyacinths in a thick round glass pot on a low table , beside a sofa like a brocade Zeppelin . Letters had been stacked on a desk , along with catalogues of paintings in glossy colours and a pile of unopened packages . Between the windows there was a picture in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow on me . You 're the first to notice it , everyone else has taken it for hotel furnishings . I 'm not sure if you get a good mark or not . " He stood by a table where there were bottles and glasses set out on a tray , and watched Caro move through the expensive shadows of the room . Saw her sleeve , of some dark-reddish colour , burn in lamplight , and the strand of chain on her neck . At her window and in her office he had twice seen her solitary , habitual , but not resigned . His thought re-enacted an instant when he had looked up at a window , his glance drawn by a branch of blossom in a vase . She had no unoccupied zone of objective feeling . He supposed men might find irritating or formidable her air of awaiting some solemn event that could not possibly he their own approach.  |p186He  said , " It has no suspense . " Watching her , he was thinking how , in some great pictures , every particle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time a miracle : which is no more than the precise truth . He said , " Some paintings transmit the suspense of life itself . " He thought most men would hardly dare to touch her , or only with anger , because she would not pretend anything was casual . It was unflattering , what she was apparently willing to dispense with in consequence of this belief . He poured liquor into glasses and talked about the picture . Parted on speech , his lips were dissimilar : the lower , jutting and conclusive ; the upper , thin , delicate , and considerate to the point of weakness . Which was certainly better than the other way round . Caro Bell sat on ballooning damask and held a glass of vodka , and the man Vail sat at her side . Their feet were outstretched towards the flowers and the low table in shoes of identical fine brown leather . To think they could both have excellent shoes . " What are you laughing at ? " " At the democracy of shoes . " The lamp was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doorway a low light showed slippers aligned on a white mat . There would be a sheet folded neatly back , a good dressing-gown ready on the counterpane , new books beside a bed : all this a form of freedom , since he made it so . Even when he rolled his body round to bring out a handkerchief or produce cigarettes , it was an un-English roll suggestingfresh energies , opinions , sights , affinities , a landscape . There was a time-change to him , a resetting of a mental watch . Everything else was this time yesterday . Soon he and she would go downstairs to dinner , like guests in a country house . He said that on Sunday they might take a drive , if she was free . " A spin , I suppose you 'd say . Can I handle the wrong side of these roads ? " " You can . And no one 's said spin for years . " Except , possibly , Sefton Thrale . She agreed she would love to see the Fens . It was long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bowl of flowers had been set over a telegram that lay on the table . Through bevelled water the print rose up , unevenly magnified : " EXECUtion INEVItable , " like a lesson in elocution . Adam Vail said , " Small letters grow larger when seen through a vessel filled with water . Seneca points that out.  |p187It  was an early concept in optics . " He said , " Seneca is full of good things . " He grasped the rim of the vase and shifted it , and the letters relapsed into insignificance : ineffectual insects that had terrifiedbeneath a microscope . On Vail 's bureau at the hotel there was a photograph of an adolescent girl : " My daughter . " Father and daughter resembled , but did not get along . " Josie blames me for her mother 's death . Blame generally shifts around a bit with age , at least I have to hope so . " In a wallet there was a photograph of a thin woman in a jersey and trousers . " My wife killed herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " like a rhyme . " Do you blame yourself ? " " She had often said it , that she would . She 'd had every kind of treatment . Eventually it becomes hard to know how to handle it . " Like Dora : I can always die , always die . Caro said , " There is the damage on both sides . " He asked , " Have you been close to someone like that ? " Once he said it was possibly reported that they saw each other . " But I will make sure no harm comes to you . " " Who would watch us ? " " My countrymen and yours . Because a man with no axe to grind is a revolutionary nowadays . " " You only hold them to their proclaimed principles . " " That is what modern revolution means . " " The first morning , in the street , you were like a figure in a spy story . " " They will turn it all into a spy story , if they can . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I got the habit of carrying it in rough places . " He handed it to her and the weight was surprising , like an opinion out of character . He took it back and pressed the catch to show the blade . So this man of peace went armed with a sword . There was a photograph of a whitewashed house in the sun : lemon groves , vineyards . In the distance , a white town blotched by poverty and weather . " The Lipari Islands . " " Then that 's how it 's pronounced . " " When Josie was little she called them the Slippery Islands . " He put the picture down . " You shall see them , the islands . "  |p188He  asked , " Is there someone else in love with you ? " " You 're in luck , sir , there 's been a cancellation . " Nothing could have been more seductive , or improvident , than his receptivity and generosity of mind : I will take care that no harm comes to you , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall see the islands . There was a night of extraordinary silence . " What time is it ? " Caro had a clock by her bed . " Nearly four . " " Then they 're gone . " Tomorrow there would be a brief paragraph on an inside page : EXECUTIONS CARRIED OUT . She laid her head on his shoulder , and drew breath so that her breast might fill his palm . She said , " What were you thinking , that first morning in the street ? " " Foreseeing everything but you . "  |p189Christian  Thrale credited himself with special sensibilities towardspictures . In galleries where art had been sagely institutionalized , he walked and paused like all the rest , yet believed his own stare more penetrating than most ; and , when others strolled ahead , would linger , patently engrossed beyond the ordinary . Christian furthermore believed that there was an English way of regarding works of art ( and in that he was perfectly correct ) . He would not have said this , but felt it . Phrases such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " The Elgin Marbles " held , for him , more than passing proprietary meaning . They summarized a proper custody and appeared to state a desirable case . He did not much care for private collections unless magnitude had rendered them impersonal . Although happiest , or safest , in the great museums , he would once in a while take in , as he put it , a loan exhibition ; but this happened rarely . When  --  declining the catalogue  --  heentered the carpeted rooms of a private gallery on a Saturday of bitter cold , he was departing from habit in the way that had , at the Albert Hall eight years earlier , brought Grace into his orbit and altered a number of lives . Once again it was a case of weekend work , the sight of a poster , and himself alone . Today , the very poster had been headed " Retrospective . " A shade of all this was passing through his mind when he saw Caro , whose sudden materialization was consequently both startling and inevitable . Caro had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her cold hands locked inside the sleeves . Her hair hung on her shouldersin indecorous black streaks and coils , her lips were painted scarlet . She was leaning her weight hack on one foot like a dancerp190in position , and behind her was a big man who might , in his stability , have been her partner . ( For some time after the event , Christian'srecollection would work on the image of Caro standing that way , with the man Vail at her back ready to raise her aloft . ) In the painting before them the heads of two women appeared , aflame , facing one another but not aligned . " There it is , then , " Adam Vail was saying at that moment . He had lent the picture , which belonged to him . From the other end of the room , Christian observed them . He himself remained transfixed , poised by their immobility . When they both moved , Christian was released and moved too , in their direction . Adam Vail leaned forward to stare at the picture . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached in a top pocket for his glasses . There was gesso where there should have been gold . Vail put his forefinger to it , and an attendant at once came over . " Not to touch the exhibits , if you do n't mind , sir . " When Vail stood back , he went on , " Sorry , but that 's the way accidents ap-pens . " When Christian saw them alone again and smiling , he went up . As he did so he felt himself at a disadvantage . He usually saw Caro in his own house where he was  --  not to put too fine a point on it  --  in the driver 's seat . This day , before he so much as spoke , he had a sense of intrusion or irrelevance . He wondered if this were simply due to the act of accosting ; and did not think to attribute it to Caro 's power on that morning of her beauty . In an effort to establish dominion , he kissed Caro  --  which was not quite necessary and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her was American did not provide the customaryadvantage either . Vail would not talk loudly or instructivelyor about himself , or make ungainly gestures , even when provoked . This composure of speech and hands warned Christianagainst any customary staking out of his conversational position : Vail 's honesty would have transparency in return , at whatevercost to the respondent . Altogether a need arose to extend oneself that crossed Christian 's awakened retrospect with a memory of Caro years ago , when she had compelled him to rise to one of her occasions : a summer afternoon , actually , when he had brought yellow flowers to Grace.  |p191By  now the three of them were turned towards the painting , and Christian was soon absorbed , as was his way , beyond the ordinary . Caro was about to speak when he said  --  and it was somehow against his better judgment  --  " You will never , of course , get me to like that series . " They had not , of course , tried to . After a moment he continued , " This example does have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " because the American brought the word to mind . There were other Americans in the gallery , raising dogmatic voices , wheeling and slicing with unconfident hands , featurescontorted with reckless vehemence . But not this one , who did not even accept Christian as an antagonist . Christian now recalled having heard the name of Adam Vail ; and felt a quick , unworthy distress , as if Caro had outwitted him . He remembered a magazine article in which Vail , asked if he considered himself a mystery man , replied , " No more so than anyone else . " The introduction to the exhibition catalogue had been written by a leading  --  or major , or brilliant  --  critic . Caro read out a sentence and asked , " What does it mean ? " Vail looked over her shoulder . " They come to think they 've had something to do with painting the pictures . " The three of them wandered round the rooms , more or less together . Christian gave no more opinions , but tried out a series of bombastic thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the wind blows . He had seen how Vail looked over Caro 's shoulder , his body not quite touching hers : grey wool divided from red by a vibration . After a while Christian said he must be off , and left them ; giving Caro another blunt , incommensurate kiss . He walked home perplexed by a sensation , sharp yet heavy , close to disappointment . Possibly he had imagined Caro cut out for some denouement that would vindicate , or redeem , the cautiousorder of his own existence  --  a culmination , even tragic , that only she seemed fitted to enact . Or perhaps he had wished , for the greater common good , to see her sink into vapid domesticitylike other women , sink into it as housewives sink exhaustedlyinto arm-chairs at evening . He detested the idea that she and Vail were lovers , but less for the imagined carnality than because Vail was personable , resolute , and rich . The satisfaction to Christian in withholding compassion from Caro had sprung directly from her need , her poverty . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . And he allowed himself , like a luxury , the honest thought : I might have helped her . At home , Christian sat in his usual chair . And his little boy clambered over him as though he were a playground fixture . One day in May Caroline Bell asked , and received , an extra hour for lunch . When she returned to the office she learned in the corridor from Mr. Bostock that Valda had refused to prepare tea or procure sandwiches at lunchtime or ever again . Entering Mr. Leadbetter 's office , Caro was asked to close the door . Leadbetter put down his ball-point , signifying the personal . Had in truth taken up the plastic pen in order to make the gesture of setting it aside . He folded his hands . " Perhaps you can enlighten me , Miss Bell . " His enlaced fingers parted , then closed , as if to play cat's-cradle . " Miss Fenchurch has some grievance ? " " She does not like to serve food . It is an imposition . " " And is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accepted part of her functions ? " " By whom is it accepted ? " " By every woman here except Miss Fenchurch and , I now take it , yourself . Had there been a wider sense of unfitness , the girls would have expressed it generally . " " Most people have to have unfitness pointed out to them . At first there is usually only one person who does that . " Mr. Leadbetter had , as he was to put it to his wife that evening , seldom been so vexed . " And do you not find this a paltry and selfish attitude ? The men in this office are , after all , forgoing the lunch hour altogether , remaining at their desks for extra duty . The girls are merely asked  --  required  --  to help them discharge onerous extra tasks . " " The men do nothing that lowers their self-esteem . On the contrary , staying at their desks exalts it . " " I see that you are highly defensive . " Not raised to such figures of speech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimeshe said " highly defensive , " sometimes " highly aggressive "  --  it amounted to the same thing . Similarly , would accuse : " Are n't you a little too positive ? " or " Rather too negative ? "  --  propositions , interchangeable and unanswerable , that had never failed to con/found . He could not imagine what people meant when they said the language was in decline . Caro said , " I withhold my analysis of your own attitude . " Leadbetter 's unlaced fingers came down on the blotter with a synchronized slap . " Miss Bell , do you really not find this incident utterly grotesque ? " " I know that any adherence to a principle can be called grotesque , and even made to appear so . At least for a time . " " You call it a principle . A tempest in a teacup . " " Mr. Bostock said , in a teapot . " He was now at white heat : molten Leadbetter . ( To his wife that evening he would say , " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ) " Miss Bell , since you yourself find our ways so unsatisfactory , perhaps you should seriously consider returning to  --  ah  --  New Zealand . " In a long pause he was made to feel her superior strength , and the fact that she had been withholding it for years out of charity . " In fact I have come to give you my resignation . " His mouth opened and closed : like a horse with carney . " And may I inquire the motive ? " " I am going to be married . " Then he hated her , for her liberty and her looks and her happiness , and that remark about the teapot . The Gatling jammed : words would not so much as sputter . However , since even she could only be delivered by male intervention , he eventually smiled and made his last attack . " I had already assumed something of the kind . "  |p194Grace  Thrale was on her way out of Harrods through the rug department , which had the space and solemnity of a cathedral . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building , and thick rolled strips of carpet stood or lay like the fallen drums of columns in a temple . Wilton was piled on Axminster , forming floral platforms . And Grace was smiling , though not at these . " Grace . " Ted Tice caught up with her in a Moroccan transept . " Been lodging a complaint ? " She stopped , and stopped smiling . " Ted . " " How are your boys ? " She smiled again . " Rowdy . " They walked , and halted . " Are you in town for a bit ? " " Only the day . I needed some things for my new place . I manage for myself . " His collar was wrinkled , his shirt front showed the ogival mark of an inexpert iron . He held up his package . " And I just bought a pair of binoculars . " " So you sometimes look at the earth . " " Only in concert halls . " Ted was cheerful : She will tell Caro we met . " I phoned Caro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him so confident , or unsuspecting . He might be thinking time was on his side . She had pondered it all in a moment , while they talked of her children , and knew she would speak . " Ted , do you have a minute ? Let 's sit down . " His expression at once stilled in apprehension , with the sense for bad news one develops from infancy . Grace sat on an upturned drum of ruby wool . Nearby , a rose-red parody of Persia was flung down by a salesman , though not for prayer.  | " Ted . " She had never used his name so much . " She is writing you today . " In that instant Grace somewhat resembled Caro , as always when matters grew serious . Ted could see it , the turn of head and the clasped hands . If he put his fingers to the nape , he would find the cord there , prominent as Caro 's . He said , " She is getting married . " " Do sit down . " A hostess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victorian hero on the carpet , or carpets . A salesman paused , and tweaked a nine-by-twelve . " Thank you we 're just looking . " Staring at one another , Grace and Ted created a tension not easily absorbed into rugs . He did not so much as ask , Who . " His name is Adam Vail , an American . " Grace obtained a respite describing Vail , as if in the process she hoped to put Ted Tice at his ease . She rambled , " He is kind , and interesting . He is very strong , I mean his character . " This pierced Ted ; but in fact Grace was making an instinctive contrast with her own husband . Ted said , " I have met him . " He thought , I am behaving well , but in fact it has not yet touched me . Grace babbled , " Fortyish , very nice , they will be in England quite often . " Ted Tice 's face was youthful for the last time , as is said to happen in death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very soon , two or three weeks . You have to have , they have to have papers . Not being British , you see . You  --  they  --  go to Caxton Hall . Where foreigners are married . Dora has to get back , she 's in Malta with her friend Dot Cleaver . Then there 's a daughter , there is Adam 's daughter , coming from New York , she is fourteen . Fifteen . " Grace was getting to an end of details and would soon be starkly left with a man 's anguish . A salesman brushed by , with a customer . " We have it in celadon or kumquat . Or can order in mandarin . " This pair was engrossed , a happy couple . Caro would have known what to say : not the right thing , but the truth . Caro would have spoken truly or kept a true silence . In accepting to be the sweet one of the sisters , tame and tractable , Grace had by no means intended to cast herself away . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had believed she held in reserve an untapped bounty of more difficult humanity ; which was not now forthcoming . Ted 's suffering was not obscurep196to her  --  indeed , her imagination occasionally played out such mattersin some Austro-Hungarian empire of the heart . But she could rouse no true instinct with which to feel his pain or comfort him . And was suddenly afraid that sweet people might have little imagination . On any day of the year Grace Thrale might be smiled at in the street by an elderly couple or by some young mother herding her noisy brood : saluted , that is , as a kindred spirit . Caroline Bell never attracted this delectable complicity . There were times when Grace wished the world were not so sure of her , so confident that boredomhad claimed her . Yet in her daily existence feared the smallest deviation from habit as an interruption that might bring chaos . Grace no more wanted adventure than Dora wanted peace . She did not convince herself , as some women do , that she retained capacity for a wholly different existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the practised conformity of her days gratified her own desires . Yet one might cling to security and still be bored by it . In its first appeal , security offered an excitement almost like romance ; but that rescue might wear down , like any other . In the evenings , putting away dishes or silver , this still golden Grace could sigh herself , mentally , into a squat housewife with a dowager 's hump . She offered , " If you liked , we could go up and have tea . " There was a place upstairs where women sat among their packages and were asked , Milk or lemon . " Grace , my dear , you were running when we met . Let me go on down with you . " Ted Tice saw  --  but it was incidental to his state of mind  --  that Grace Thrale , who had been his timid ally , had changed allegiance and thrown him over for the prize of Vail . He would get out from this broadloom solemnity , these sarcastic rugs and mechanical inquiries from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on into Lamps , heading for the stairs . Behind them , the salesman yawned : " Or there 's always goat . " Ted was aware of a blue velvet suit  --  no , only the collar was velvet , the rest speckled wool , a suit all to do with Grace 's life and customs , like the gothic indictment of the iron on his own shirt . He acknowledged her body , twice convulsed by childbirth and reassembled , shapely as a suit , heroically normal . He likewise wouldp197maintain motion and equilibrium , though ripped asunder ; and had kindly said , " My dear . " On the ground floor they passed stacked bolts of the materials women never wore now  --  georgette , heavy crepe , pongee . There was a serious , dry smell of stuff that must be measured , cut , and sewn . A man in black expertly placed lengths thumb to thumb : " Three and a half yards , madam ? " A high voice asked , " And where are Remnants ? " Grace went ahead through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doors back and forth in the formal motions of their dance : " Kyou , " " Kyou . " Outside , a cold afternoon showed the season merely by reluctance to darken . A stout doorman wearing war ribbons cryptically signalled taxis ; a trio of street musicians in ancient serge bawled about Tipperary while a fourth held out a khaki cap weighted by a single , central halfcrown . Grace said , " I ca n't bear these singers . Let 's walk a bit . " They moved together along the shop-windows , where mannequins in print frocks raised orange arms against tropical settings , in ecstatic , vital contrast to the waxen matrons lifelessly passing . " I 'm certain I 'm delaying you , Grace . " Grace could not bear his good manners or the thought that this man in his crisis indulged her as a dying officer might joke to a rattled subordinate on a battlefield . She leaned against a glassed tableau of beachwear and looked in his face , trying to make up for years of willful insipidity in an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be better for you ? Now there 's no false hope . It will be awful at first , but  --  " Grace 's handbag slid to her elbow on its strap and she grasped her own jacket by both lapels as urgently as she might have clutched at Ted 's . A consciousness of Dora flickered . Let me not sound like Dora , I 'm sure you 'll he very happy . She said , " Now you are free . " The cicatrice of stitching on her gloves was an imprint on his brain . Earrings of pearl stared , white-eyed as fish . There was a streak of flowered scarf , inane , and the collar blue . Grief had a painter 's eye , assigning arbitrary meaning at random  --  like God . Ted thought , I was really better off inside the shop . I was pretty numb in there . After all , the claustrophobic building had providedp198shelter of a kind , with its avenues resembling city planning , its racks and trays overflowing with daily life , its suburbs named Millinery and Haberdashery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tice was grappled , and experienced bodily lightness of a sort that accompanies physical peril . He would get through these moments as a duty in preparation for the next phase , the realization that was to take him over and maul him . Whatever might have been thought an hour before as he was buying binoculars , or some few minutes past , no one glancing at him now would have called him a young man . He took one of Grace 's gloved hands and placed it against his own jacket , where it did finally and diffidently clasp his lapel . Earringshammered , silk daisies panicked on the scarf . At her back a silver plastic palm tree was jagged as forked lightning . " What I have done has been for hope of her . What I do now will be for lack of her . " He let Grace 's hand drop , and the bag fell again to her wrist . " Do you call it freedom ? " " That may not always be true . " Grace was thinking that a woman would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They walked back to the corner , where the shoppers bandied the doors back and forth . The singers were on to " Danny Boy " now , the half-crown solitary in the cap , the pennies expertly shaken under the lining . It was Christian who had told Grace about this trick . They crossed to the entrance of the Underground . There was vibration in the road , a subterranean breath from the pit-head . A red-fleshed woman was peddling little wads of heather to people dashing up and down the steps , but did not approach these two who stood silent . Grace thought , I suppose you 'd get to know when it was hopeless . In the rush of tunnelled air they turned to stare at one another . A look two persons might exchange who , having carried an immenseweight to some forlorn halt , now set it down and meet each other 's eyes . Grace had come as far as she could ; Ted would go down alone . The photograph showed a substantial jaw , hound-dog eyes ; the face expressionless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An accompanying paragraph referred to a previousp199marriage and a daughter . A big man with an overcoat bundled on , standing in a bleak portico . At his side Caro was a novice at public life . Not dressed in wedding clothes , she had nonetheless unmistakably just been married . Where the picture was cut off , the backs of their hands met  --  her right hand , his left , not clasped but transmitting the private message for all the world to see . " There 's one here too . " Tertia knew what Paul was staring at , and raised her own page slightly to show an indistinct image . There was a heading , and below the photograph a caption said , " The couple is shown leaving the edifice . " In Paul 's newspaper Caro was an Australian typist ; in Tertia 's , a senior official . It was also stated that the couple had met while working on a humanitarian enterpriseinitiated by the British government . " So that awful sister got those girls fixed up . Dora or Flora , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand it to her . She brought them to London and launched them . " Paul said , " They 're not the Gunning sisters , you know . " Though seeing them for a moment just that way  --  eighteenth-century beautiesin pastel silk with upswept hair and translucent glances , taking London by storm , being the Rage . In Tertia 's newspaper Caro 's eyes were lowered , she was a grey blur that did not even carry flowers . The man was large , an un-English physiognomy , big head , heavy , impassive . Caro was now endorsed , valuable : an obscure work newly attributed to a master . Tertia exchanged newspapers with Paul . " Flora-Dora pulled it off . " To see how much Paul minded . " I rather like to think of Caroline Bell with billions . " " No one ever said the Vail man had billions . " " Where does the money come from anyway ? " " Catfood . " " It says here , bauxite . Whatever that is . " Paul elaborated : " Penthousespapered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bodyguards , " said Tertia . And " Lovers . " Paul folded the paper to read it  --  neatly , like a clerk in a train . " At any rate the astrologer did n't get her . " " What does ' at any rate ' mean ? " Tertia turned pages with her brutal gesture . Upstairs , a child wept , laughed , spoke , then mumbled , acting out the ages of man.  |p200Tertia  suddenly said , " Nick Cartledge . Who used to stay with us . " She could have been protesting at last . " What about him ? " " He 's dead . " " What of ? " " Liver complaint . " " Well  --  he certainly worked for it . " Tertia put the paper down . Nicholas Gerald Wakelin Cartledge . For her , it was an untimely death . She said , " The old roue , " trying to shrug off mortality itself ; but sat there changing into a woman who knew the dead . After a time Paul said , " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Dot Cleaver , " He is no Phoebus Apollo . As you can see . " Dora would say Phoebus Apollo , or Pallas Athene , or Venus de Milo , distinguishing these immortals , by full title , from the terrestrial Glad or Trish . " It is an awful picture of them both , oh simply awful . And the snaps are no better . " She showed . " I 'd had a nasty knock from the car door , you can see the pain in my eyes . " Dora had moved that day into Caro 's vacated flat , which was filled with flowers . " They will be in Italy by now . " Dot Cleaver said , " When I first went to Rome , I did everything . Everything . I took the guide-book , I did everything . Well , that 's over with , now I just please myself . You absorb more of a place that way . " Dora gave a sigh that influenced the entire room . She observed , after a time , that even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of your nice tea ? " Dot Cleaver arched her brows , body , and wrist , grasping a china handle that was itself a mark of interrogation . " Then they go to New York . " " Oh yes , they have everything they want there , all their interests , books , plays , music . " Dot Cleaver had recently attended an enthralling recital , but could not recall the programme . " In any case , they 'll be over to see you in no time . " " Why should they bother . I do n't blame them . " Dora 's ambition now was to be cast off . That was to be the culmination of her long alienation , the vindication of her overmastering belief in enmity ,  |p201ingratitude  , and whole congeries of wrongs . She had already told Caro , " Do n't feel you have to see me . " Her process of testing , now finely honed , was never at rest . Provocation had become the basis of her relations with the world . Caro had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many cheeks we still have left to turn . " He tore out the page , folded it , tore again along the fold . Then trimmed the picture and paragraph with scissors . These methodical actions seemed to have been leading somewhere , and when he had completed them Ted could scarcely believe he was left with a photograph of Caroline Bell 's wedding . The accompanying legend , though conventionally phrased , was not quite comprehensible  --  as if written in uncials , or Cyrillic . He stared into the dim little picture for some familiar thing that might give him a claim on her . But her clothes were new , uncharacteristicwith occasion . In her left hand , a small object , certainly not a prayerbook and most probably a purse . The photograph banished him completely , declining association : an extra cruelty , when her possessions had always enchanted him  --  a green silk belt , a notehookcovered in blue cloth , a white dish in which she kept oranges . In the photograph she turned away , forsaking all others . The clipping lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constricting tissue had been trimmed away . The whole room could not confine it or contain the injury . Ted Tice put his right hand on it , and hung his head  --  aware , like an onlooker , that this bowed posture required , for its own caption , a dated phrase : " He went under . " A grown man with lowered head is a foolish sight , and scarcely a man . There was no one to whom he need excuse himself . Obligation was the first detail erased by grief . He thought he would go out and tire himself with walking . Or would get drunk , like a disappointed man in a story . But looked , without moving , at his sweater and cap and a striped scarf  --  outwardthings whose reasonableness he would not believe in again.  |p202So  Caroline Bell lived in a house in New York City and took the name of Vail . From the top of the house , which was in a row of short buildings faced with purplish stone , there was a view of the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late sun as surely as the mountains of the Taygetus bring early dark down to Sparta . The rooms were not numerous but relatively large , because dividing walls had here and there been removed . In this house Adam Vail had been born . There were many objects over which Caroline Vail could never wish for , or assert , jurisdiction . Chairs , books , pictures , a screen from China , a leather folder fraying on a desk , a jade saucer , a convenient , ugly little light beside a bed  --  every thing was habitual except Caro herself . She had contributed four boxes of books , a chipped plate from Palermo , and an angel painted on Andalusian board . From time to time she would look at these memorials , or at her clothes in cupboards and drawers , in order to believe . A photograph at the time would have shown her more hesitant than formerly . The process of acquiring equanimity had brought its own disruptions , and some sacrifice . Caro received letters on her marriage from several men : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who gets you " ; " I hope he realizes his good fortune . " There was an element of relief at not having had to assume the privilege themselves . Her own release at leaving an entire nation to its devices was , if not commendable , also natural . In straight streets Mrs. Vail attempted to make the city over in the image of other towns , to discover its sources of continuity and solace , its places of refuge and glory . When this proved impossible ,  |p203observed  freakishness , fads , and obscure forms of endurance ; as well as flagrant forms of self-assertion and conformity . Where moralitywas concerned , fashion was indiscriminate , giving the same weight to whim as to conviction . A ceaseless milling of persons was unnatural , ludicrous , determined as the acceleration of an old movie . There was anonymity and extreme loneliness , but little reverie and no peace . Apartments were cabins in the great liners docked along the streets . The city posed its conditions like a test : those apt in its energies became initiates ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength . In modern buildings opposite the Vail house , all ground floors were doctors ' offices . In the early mornings ageing men and women would arrive without breakfast to ring these doorbells . Otherwise there was little passage of humanity on the short block , and few children . Signs of life were often associated with death or extremity : in the night , fire engines and ambulances could be heard on nearby avenues , and the revolving lantern of a police car circled private rooms with mistrustful light ; convoys of trucks trundled , purposeful as if provisioning an advancing army . In winter , the tires of cars spun shrieking in filthy snowdrifts , and derelicts fitted themselves to icy crannies of the immense and all but continuous buildings . The panorama was splendid , the detail grim . Glossiness created , or eased , a lack of contact . When summer came , plane trees obscuredthe view from Caro 's windows , and seclusion was complete . In the first weeks Caro would lie on her bed or stretch on a sofa , reading or merely still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not languor but renewal . Meanwhile , Adam Vail went swiftly through the rooms and hallways of long association , and nimbly up and down the stairs of all his life . Habits of home gave agility to his body that was heavy in repose or love . The house had a light smell of plants and polish , and oils used to preserve books or furniture . In the beginning Caroline Vail noticed this smell , which she could not afterwards rediscover . In her stepdaughter 's room there was a scent of calamine lotion , there were creams for adolescent complexions , there were tablets for pain ; there were comic books , two guitars , and recordings of Italianp204opera . There were books to do with animals in far countries  --  Ethiopia , Kenya . These belonged to dark Josie who , at the time of Caro 's arrival in the city , had gone to Africa on safari with the family of a schoolfriend , Myra . Adam said , " Myra is bad news . " Fitted into the frame of Josie 's mirror there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Una , came to lunch . Una was handsome , with an air of fashionable disbelief . She smoked her cigarettes half-through and , as she put them out , rattled a golden chain on her wrist . Her laugh , which began on a loud peal , was also abruptly extinguished , incomplete . She looked at Caro with open interest that might have been kind . Una was having an affair with a bureaucrat . She told Caro , " My friend is a diplomat "  --  diplomat being a term , like architect , whose disgrace had not yet caught up with it . That evening when her lover asked her , " How 's the bride ? " she dropped into a chair and crossed her legs : " Well . " After a time she said , " This is no case of the second Mrs. de Winter . " Eventually she lit a cigarette . " Bride 's okay . Dark hair , dark eyes , dark horse . Late twenties , maybe thirty . By no means a dope . Talks , laughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a crossword puzzle Una put out her fresh cigarette and added , " Intolerant . " " Intolerant of what ? " " People like me . " Reaching in her handbag , Una said , " Loves Adam . " She brought out a tiny enamel box . On the table at her side there were similar boxes , arranged in rows . Hansi mixed drinks and gave one to Una . She made a slight motion in his direction with the glass , and in her other hand held up the box . " Brought me a present . " She handed it to him . " Adam must have told her . " She drank from her glass , then took the box back from Hansi . She set it on the table with the others and said , " Cute . " " Ask me something , " said Adam Vail . In the night they would waken and make love . " You never have questions . " " Now I have to learn what does n't come through questions . " One afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took her in his arms . " Do n't go into a decline . "  | " It 's an ascent . " He got up then and moved about the room , rattling objects , slamming drawers , crackling a newspaper . His wife went on reading , regretting that so considerate a man should be driven to this and mildly surprised at how little restraint he was showing . He need only wait and she would give him perfect happiness . It was for this her energies were gathering , and for other proper purposes . Una was going abroad for the summer . Una , who had been divorced , said she could have a great summer at last : " For eight years I was nailed to the cross of East Hampton . " Una jangled a new bracelet . Her handsome face had a costly sheen , she wore what the ancient Romans called summer jewellery . Soon , from the Mediterranean , she and Hansi sent a postcard of pink bungalows on a beach . Adam said , " It 's a place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why should millionaires always be at the end of their tether ? " " They 're the ones who can afford to be . " He touched her face . " You look fine , yourself . " " The beginning of my tether . " Caro took Adam 's arm in the street and stood to look . A show of professionalism in machines and buildings was reproduced , with less success , in persons : existence had been turned over to the experts . " We "  --  she meant , people from elsewhere  --  " will always be amateurs compared with this . " Adam said , " Our great and secret fear is that America may turn out to be a phenomenon , rather than a civilization . Hence , in part , the scale , the insistence , the need to prove the great mysteries obsolete or serviceable . We want our lust to be loved and called beautiful . To receive the homage due to love . " Adam Vail linked his wife 's fingers with his own . " Hence also a compulsion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But if Americans themselves say these things . " " Just do n't you go agreeing with any of it , that 's all . " Vail laughed . " Oh Caro , we are much worse , and perhaps better , than you so far secretly think . " Adam was taking Cam to see a friend who lived at 149th Street . When they came home , Caro said , " Why should anyone stand it ? "  |p206Una  , who was back from Sardinia , told her : " The American Negro is overadjusted to his problem . " Adam said , " But not for much longer . " One September evening Caroline Vail sat by a window with a book of poetry . Adam asked , " Wo n't you say aloud what you 're reading ? " She began , and spoke some lines in a voice high , thin , and unfamiliar : " Primaeval rocks form the road 's steep border , And much have they faced there , first and last , Of the transitory in Earth 's long order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that we two passed . " She laid the book down without keeping the place , and turned her face away . " Sad , " she said . " That 's why I 'm crying . " Adam stroked her head , her shoulders . When he put his arms round her , her body could scarcely be seen . " Who knows why she is crying . Who knows why Caroline is really crying . " In the autumn Grace wrote that Paul Ivory had a tremendous success with a play called The One Flesh . She also reported , more diffidently , that Ted Tice had married the daughter of a scientist . Soon there was a letter from Ted with the same information , and a new address . He hoped Caro and Margaret might one day meet . He wrote , " Here , among the young , we have a clinging to one 's times that is like a substitute for patriotism : a pledge of immaturity . For anything in the way of enlightenment , you need people who do not have contemporaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caro lost her own claim on youth . Speaking of enlightenment , Ted went on , the great telescope had been inaugurated at its site in the south of England , with a ceremonyattended by the Queen . Owing to a complete absence of visibility , Royalty had managed to command nothing but a show of vapours . Dora wrote that Gwen Morphew had mysteriously come into money , and had left Glad Pomfret high and dry . It was best to expect ingratitude , then nothing surprised you . Dora , whom Carop207could now provide with a house near Dot Cleaver 's , wrote of domestic difficulties . She did not wish to be a worry to Caro in her happiness , and it would all work out somehow . One thing she had learned , and the hard way , was to trouble no one . " It is almost true , " Caro said , " that she is not a worry to me in my happiness . " Caro took her stepdaughter to a recital by a great guitarist . Walkinghome , the girl said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Next week we 'll have better seats . " She took Josie to the ballet , and Josie said , " Myra 's at the doubleheader . " She meant that Caro could count herself favoured . If Caro did , it was not for that reason . Adam Vail made a trip to Chile and Peru . " Next time you will he with me . " Una told Caro , " Adam is obsessed . You must have realized that . Ile is obsessed by people 's sufferings . It is something you will have to face . " " I have faced those who do not care at all . " She did not see why Una should instruct , who had not succeeded . One day , however , Una said , " I think it 's great , " and crumpled a Kleenex . Caro lay in a hospital bed after a miscarriage , and Adam Vail flew home from Lima . When Caro closed her eyes , darkness restored her to private existence . Someone said , " Now I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , so new and astonishing as to have intellectual interest . In the dark it might be Paul leaning over her : " Now I have to hurt you . " Like other suffering , the apartness of infirmity was either unreality or full reality at last . Once she had stood apart in a hot corridor and contemplated her own death . In the dark her thoughts were redistributed , through displacementof hope . Adam said , " There are two of us to bear it . " " It was n't this I meant to share . " When Caro was better , Josie told her , " I was ambivalent anyway . I felt very threatened . " Confidence in her own simplicity could inspire cruelty scarcely credible . She was often angry , and whenp208crossed would lower her head and weep : " I am being put in a position . " Her great weapon was her weakness , the massive deterrentto which all deferred . There was the dread thatJosie too would take up death as her lethal instrument . " I am so afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God into all of them . Caro said , " If she would n't try so much to classify her emotions . " " Are you asking that she renounce her American birthright ? " Adam said , " She will grow up , grow older . " Caro recalled childhood hopes centred on Dora 's seventieth birthday . " We have to bring her round before that . " Only Una would occasionally repulse Josie 's attacks , and was unafraid of the girl 's tears . Una remarked , " Bite something often enough , kiddo , and it bites right back . " Una told Caro , " You get the message . " " Even those messages she is unaware of sending . " Josie had the eyes noticeable in troubled young women , eyes that are sidelong even when direct . She had the inanition that **25;7083;TOOLONG . She was already setting up an apparatus of blame , in apprehension of failure . To Caro , Josie would state the obvious : " You 're not my mother . " To be sure of the hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For one thing , I 'm not old enough . " Caro told Una , " Josie 's belief in her innocence is her warrant for doing harm . " Una said , " Like America . " Alone together , Myra and Josie mocked Caroline Vail  --  her voice , manner , and opinions , her habit of touching her hair . Josie told Myra , " She ca n't have children . " " That 's why she 's trying to take you over . Well , tell her she can cut that right out . " Caro could feel the wish she be cut right out . From far off she could sense Josie Vail thinking of her with resentment ; as she might , even now , feel Ted Tice think of her with love . Myra told Josie , " Ca n't you see the way they 're using you ? " If Myra had anything to do with it , Josie would never believe she herself might be an object of affection . All this was plain as ifJosie had reported it : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubleness of phrase madep209all apparent . When Myra was present , Josie must prove herself : " How can you talk such shit , Caro ? " In Myra 's absence , the girl was loyally abusive , in order to have something to report . Nothing creates such untruth in you as the wish to please . Myra 's eyes were downward , lank hair concealed her cheeks . Myra was for the present strong , because consuming another 's life . Caro would wonder what particular Benbow had taken Myra to the bottom . Adam said , " She mistakes suspicion for insight . " Caroline Vail found herself unsuitably immune to the judgment of Josie . She only wished to restrain the girl in her worst assaults , knowing that , if you wrong someone enough , you can not bear to be with them . In secret Caro dwelt on the release from emotional obligation , and could see how indifference might become seductive . What Josie took for exposure on Caro 's part had been an offering of trust  --  a test the girl had failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not indefinitely . Adam touched his wife 's arm . " Perhaps you mind more than you show . " " When you realize someone is trying to hurt you , it hurts less . " " Unless you love them . " Adam hoped Caro might one day almostlove Josie , as she would the city  --  through contiguity and shared experience . He thought it would be a pity if only the lovable were loved . He wanted to say , " It was her mother "  --  having seen the child 's interest in the universe turned to envy and mistrust . But felt the indelicacy , and inaccuracy , of accusing his dead wife , who would even yet come to his mind as first known , in irresistible youth and beauty . When young , Adam Vail had admired as intellect his first wife 's plausible instinct for human flaws , and had not seen in this the portent of disaster . He , who wished above all things to be rational , had allied himself with unreason on her behalf . Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . One cause of this was his pride , which could not admit his own defencelessness ; another was the persuasive force of his wife 's antipathies : singlemindedin delusion , she was spared the equivocations of sanity . Gradually it had come about that she needed still another enemy ,  |p210and  only he remained to fill the role . It seemed she had intended this : all the while he imagined he was comforting or reclaiming her , she had been preparing their doom . Then began her threat of death , to command the straying attention of the world . To the utterer , the threat is an addiction that requires increasing dosage . Bystanders , on the other hand , are slowly immunized . Adam told Caro , " There is no greater tyranny than a continual state of desperation . " He , who considered himself a man , had become , with his first wife , vulnerable as an intimidated child . She acted on him like a wasting disease : all healthy links to life were infidelities to be rescinded . His maturity shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only sporadic arousal was physical desire . In fear , he felt his will contract , grow small and smaller , until it was a hard , shrivelled nut inside his breast . He had intended magnitude ; and was a small hard thing in a shell . Within the incubus of her infirmity , she was so strong and he so weak . Adam Vail began to dream that he was strangling his mad and therefore guiltless wife . He dreamed , also , his own suffocation . Insufficiency of space and breath became a waking preoccupation : in the streets he pushed a way through crowds , unable to extend his pace or self to full dimensions . One day she came to the top of the stairs , and called his name . Her hand was dark . He said , " Charlotte . Charlotte . " " I 've hurt myself . " There was blood from a gash . His horror was as much for the release , the exoneration , as for the event . His wife had saved him by going so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow her . It was then he had learned the patience now apparent , and laboriously renewed his ties with life . Not guilty by reason of insanity , his wife was yet incapable of innocence . Madness might sometimes give access to a kind of knowledge . But was not a guarantee . Caro said , " We must bring Josie round . " Caro had mellowed with new youth , and was content . If this could happen to her , whyp211not to Josie ? She had once told Paul Ivory that capacity need not be adverse . Optimism was vindicated , like prayer , when Myra 's father was transferred , with all his family , to California . Una 's lover Hansi had a suite at the Carlyle and an entertainment allowance . From time to time would fly to Delhi or Tokyo for a congress he cheerfully designated useless . He often held a book in his hand , any book , on which to prop the word puzzles he also carried . These puzzles were his only known mental exertion . Hansi would say of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God in his infinite mercy created the international conference . May this providential , improvident , and peculiarly iniquitous racket , designed to support the moral and mental degenerates of our modern world , flourish forever . " Josie could hardly , and did not , contain herself . While Hansi sat deciphering anagrams , Josie would belabour him for his shoes , luggage , vicuna coat , and grey Mercedes , his suite at the Carlyle , and an illegal arrangement to do with free liquor . Hansi laughed , yawned , and pondered a palindrome . On a single occasion , Hansi broke silence . " At twenty , a man inactively ranting against social injustice is a promise ; at thirty , a windbag . At age twenty-five , I , Hansi , spotted the era of the windbagapproaching , and I clammed up . While , it is true , proceeding to profit from the organized international windbag industry : that idea whose hour has struck . I have my own form of ineffectuality , but I do n't dress it up as morality . I decline to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never lift a finger . We are in the age of the open mouth and unlifted finger ; of those who must talk faster than the world can find them out . Is not that the basis of all modern statecraft , not to speak of battalions of the socially consciouswho likewise will never see action ? When they excavate the new Pompeii , the intelligentsia will be discovered squatting petrifiedon the floor , mouths agape to denounce materialism , with their built-in cost-of-living adjustments turned to stone in their pockets . I who am in due course to die do not salute them . " Josie said , " And what in hell is all that supposed to mean ? " Adam told her , " Hansi fears that aimlessness and bombast go together . "  | " I must correct you , " said Hansi . " I do not fear but know it . No process of reform is currently acceptable that involves the sacrifice of one hour 's sleep , one day 's pay , or one chance to deliver yet more of one 's own bluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a factual one . Reform , my dears , is neither banners nor bombs . Reform is unpaid labour , is poverty , is solitude , is the composition of innumerable letters by the midnight oil and the engagement in ignominious struggles with a duplicating machine . Reform means years spent in the mastery of uncongenial and arid themes . Reform is giving up dinners , holidays , and sex in order to pore over deadly documents in a basement . Is to be isolated , ignored , insulted , and possibly run over by a government truck . Reform is concentration and endurance . Reform , my dears , or any merest particle of it , is no more wanted at that price by our modern altruists than it is by good old Hansi . My intention , like theirs , is to wrest as much money from my employers as possible , turn up my hi-fi , indulge my appetites and tastes , and sleep long and sound each night . Unlike theirs , however , my own intention is openly declared . " Hansi unfolded his double crostic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any proven exception . " Josie remarked that she had never heard such shit . Adam told her , " It 's logical . Those who continually criticize the achievement of others must achieve something of their own or become ridiculous . " Caro said , " Still , what they achieve might be simply character . " Always , Josie noted , thinking of herself . It was intolerable to her that anyone should distinguish themselves , even by their thoughts . " Certainly , " said Hansi . " But persons of character tend to keep their counsel . I can confirm , and conclusively , that they are not to be found expounding on the windbag circuit . As example of said character , " he told Josie , " take your own father . Who has never reproached me . I consider it most handsome . "  |p213Returning  from ten days in Sicily , Ted and Margaret Tice took a house handy to everything . The handiness made it possible for Ted to walk back and forth to work , and for his wife to go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman , who was a musician . These days the will to paint was not strong in Margaret , as she believed she had all she wanted and must be happy . However , though departure for the studio was an effort every time , she was perfectly at peace once there and would overstaythe hour , breaking off work only when she heard the cellist climbing the stairs . She did not know what she found in that bleak , unheated room , and , while connecting its serenity to her marriage , could not discover where the connection lay . It was years before she realized that the stairs , the room , the easel , the canvas , and the tubes of zinc white stood for safety . In her paintings at this time , sombre forms represented the phenomena of earth , or of dreams . So they set up house , each within walking distance of safety . Ted 's parents came to visit , also Margaret 's . Hooks were screwed in place , bulbs were sunk into lampshades and windowboxes , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wedding present . Margaret shopped , and Ted picked up the library books on his way home . " Our Ted takes marriage seriously , " his mother said to Margaret , but it was rather that he had taken it up and was doing it thoroughly . He had little taste now for varnishing bookshelves or hammering things home , but was to he seen diligently at work with brush or toolbox . I le too became handy , along with everything else.  |p214Self-sufficiency  appeared complete , a training for survival on a desert island . Margaret 's mother said , " Ted has thrown himself into domestic life . He 's flung himself into it . " It might have been an abyss . Habits were established and seemed , in a month or two , lifelong . Once in a while Ted Tice would take up or put down a newspaper with a gesture beyond his years . Passing through decreed phases , Margaret Tice was first a bride , next a young housewife , and then an expectant mother . Later , would be constrained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee . Would hear herself say , as if it were some other woman , " I never use cornstarch " or " I clean up as I go along . " She felt this happening to her like symptoms of mild illness , and did not resist . But , with unintelligible nostalgia for a life she had never lived , knew that all would have been subtly and profoundly different had her husband greatly loved her . On a night in the first summer of their marriage they had gone to dinner at the house of one of Ted 's colleagues . For such occasions , scientists ' wives were trained in self-effacement  --  except for those who , scientists themselves , could put their own foot on the conversational hearth . Others , like Margaret , might provide themselves with a sweet excuse ( " She paints " ; " She 's musical " ) , but must expect to be ignored . Ted at these gatherings was often morose , detached . Respected by his colleagues , he was only sometimes liked . In his dealings with assistants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps have preferred a more culpable , and human , partiality . The same objective strength was even less welcome , brooding in a living-room . In his work Ted had for some time been studying a faint blue object , possibly a star . He had just returned from Palomar , where the controversy of red shift had now begun . It was known that he had things to say , but did not choose to tell them here . It was uncongenial , this notion of taking his own good time . The dinner was being given for a physicist who had received a celebrated prize : an elderly monolith , with bluff body and desiccatedface , who presided glumly at conferences and gave the governmentinfluential advice . His taciturn importance was implacable . Women attempting conversation with him heard their voices risingp215to a squeak : it was like scratching one 's name on a historic monument . Even when seated he continued to recall some massive object . Slumped in an indigo chair , wearing a shabby grey jacket with brown leather pads at the elbows , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret Tice appeared beside him , he half rose from the waves , exposing a Plimsoll line of sagging belt . Ted watched his wife : she was a slope of green in a straight chair , her eyes large with civility , her hand smooth on her knee . The old man-of-war gradually began to address her : speaking was his idea of giving attention . Accepting his monologue , Margaret was receivingwhat she seldom had : a man 's undivided interest . It was a warm night , windows open to a garden . Ted was rememberinglight of evening , how many summers past : the table and the talk of youth ; two girls , both beautiful , one a gazelle . He came back from talk of quarks and quasars , as if from sleep , to hear his wife say  --  it was of some book the old man had mentioned  --  " Yes , I first read it at a time when I was unhappy , and have gone back to it often . I still find it ... " " When I was unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by these words , seated there in green calm ? He was jealous of her unhappiness and had to wish himself the cause of it  --  for who else should lay claim to her distress ? In due course Margaret got up and went to speak to a friend . The physicist stood also , flying his skull and crossbones . " I do n't mind telling you , Tice , that I find your wife a most discerning woman . " Ted stood helplessly watching his wife cross the room : a most discerning woman . If she discerned what was often in my heart , if she knew what I sometimes dream . He wished to persuade himself that Margaret too might have secrets , giving her resources that would spare them both . Someone came to the open window and threw a cigarette butt accurately into a dark pond in the garden . There was the flicker , the sizzle , and a small protest from insects or a frog . The old physicist stood by the window , hitching his belt . Recallinga night of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savoy . The black river reflected , red and white , the flames and searchlights , the earth rocked and shuddered with the impact and recoil of armoury . And a burning plane twirled down from the sky ,
