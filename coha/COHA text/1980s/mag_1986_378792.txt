In the spring of 1916 , a 14-year-old San Franciscan was taken to see Yosemite National Park . There he was presented with a simple box camera . It was an epochal gift : over the next 68 years Ansel Adams was to become America 's best-known photographer and a major champion of its imperiled wilderness . Even now , when every stump in creation has been subjected to a portrait sitting , his pictures retain the power to startle . <P> Until his death in 1984 , Adams was photography 's mountain man . He has even made a posthumous climb : Adams ' autobiography is probably the most expensive book ever to scale the best-seller list . The volume owes its $50 price largely to its 277 pictures , many of them never before exhibited or published . Some have been reproduced with too little contrast , but the photographs throw as much light on Adams ' genius as anything in the text . Looking back in an amiable mood , he has produced the kind of memoir given to noting that a 1944 New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter Mondale could be " most cordial and patient " when sitting for Adams ' camera . <P> Yet as the pictures testify , this apparently prosaic man harbored a true poetic vision . A passionate student of the piano , Adams reluctantly concluded in his late 20s that his hands were too small for a concert career .

The camera , they informed him , could not express the soul . " Perhaps the camera can not , " he retorted , " but the photographer can . " <P> By the late ' 20s , Adams had become a pivotal figure in the rescue of photography from the genteel posturing of pictorialism , with its perfumed moods and swampy prints . Like-minded photographers such as Edward Weston and Imogen Cunningham joined him to found f/64 , the now legendary group that promoted the principles of sharp focus and pure , powerful form . On sunrise camera treks through Death Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts could engender the deepest feelings . <P> As his narrative continually reveals , Adams possessed a rare talent for winning the friendship of brilliant but difficult men and women , including Weston , Alfred Stieglitz and Georgia O'Keeffe . Perhaps it was because he so seldom raised his voice . The memoir boils over only once , on the subject of the Reagan Administration 's environmental policies , which spurred his worst fears about human predators nibbling at the land . <P> It may have been his acute awareness of illumination and shadow that gave Adams his elegiac outlook . At one point he recalls a moment when he and his companions came upon the scene that would become his most famous image , Moonrise , Hernandez , New Mexico ( 1941 ) . With the last rays of sunset striking the tiny settlement , Adams scrambled to set up his camera , shouting " Get that , for God 's sake ! We do n't have much time ! " Not much , but enough for an artist of sublime sensibility to catch light on the run and keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
