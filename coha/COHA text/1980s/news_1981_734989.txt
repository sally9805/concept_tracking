txt 0 ? On Monday , May 18 , from 11 a.m. to 12:20 p.m. , I tried to reach CTA information for directions . All I kept getting was a busy signal , or , when I did get through to 836-7000. all I got was a click on my line . Do the employes down there watch soap operas , or do they play cards till their time is up ? Please reply . Reader , Chicago A ? " We are returning this anonymous post-. card to you , " C. William Baxa of the CTA /*plied . " Copies of the postcard are going to the RTA Travel Information Center . A center supervisor informed us that on May 18 a total of 9,000 telephone calls came to the center . Of that number , 4,900 were serviced . The heaviest calling to the center occurs between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m . The best time to call for travel information is before 8 a.m. and after 6 p.m. , the supervisor said . Because of budget constraints , the number of service represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incoming calls from the six-county RTA region remains high . " When we tried during the evening rush hour , we got a recording that instructed us to hold , some sweet music , and then a live voice . O ? flow about some history and the reason for a lower and upper Wacker Drive ? G. B. , East 56th Street A ? The reason goes back to the Burnham Plan and the Chicago Plan Commission that carried ' It out . The idea was to create a city that works and looks good at the same time . The upper and lower levels of Wacker Drive would do three things : Divert a lot of heavy traffic , particularly trucks , to the lower level ; create a scenic drive on the upper level ; and , most importantly , get rid of the produce merchants on South Water Street . Condemnation proceedings in the early 1920s and the finding of a larger site on the near West Side took care of the produce merchants . A few years of back-breaking construction work gave us the double-decked drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Mayor William Dever , but it had already received its new name In 1924 . The city council passed an Ordinance to name the drive in honor of Charles H. Wacker , who , . in his role as the first chairman of the plan commission , led the push to beautify the city . He also supplied the push that led to creation of the drive bearing his name . Q ? I recently sent a coupon from the trustees of Indiana University Musical Arts Center first mortgage bond to American Fletcher National Bank of Indianapolis for collection . In due course , I received a check for the amount of the coupon , less $2 for a collection fee . If this is not an unethical practice , it is surely poor public relations , both for the bank and the university . If the bank can not service the account without charge to holders of the bonds , then this fact should have been made known at the time the bonds were offered for sale . To retired persons . $2 is not an inconsequential amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-examine its policy on this so that it will rescind it . Can you accomplish the impossible ? Charles Miller , Merrillville , Ind . A ? Florence Williams , a bank repesentative , said , " Mr. Miller was notified by letter that he should not have been charged a fee , and a corrected check was sent . I certainly apologize for any inconvenience . " Sound off On Memorial Day I was very disappointed with my fellow Americans in that so few houses had the American flag displayed , ewe . Molly because so many of our soldiers died in the cause of freedom . Another holiday will soon be upon us , the ' 4th of July . It would be wonderful if every house would have an Amur . icon flag displayed on that day . We have inflation , yes . It would be a sacrifice for many to buy a flag , but it certainly would be a worthy one . This includes our ethnic citizens as well . Their leaders ( clergymen , etc. ) should forward this message to them in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , and blue , and also that of learning our English language to show their apprecia. tion . This might be a good time for all Ameri , cans to reflect , count our blessings , and show our gratitude .
