Dinnertime , and the cavernous mess hall is overflowing with gray-clad cadets and a sprinkling of visitors . Two women cadets sit at a table with the reporter and other guests . " They 're so pretty , " one woman whispers . " Why would they ever come to West Point ? " <P> A middle-aged man approaches the table , three stars glittering on his tan Army jacket . One of the women , a captain in the cadet Brigade , turns to greet him . After a brief exchange , the lieutenant general bends forward and kisses her affectionately on the cheek . Conversation at the table halts . After a moment , a male cadet sneers : " I bet you 've never seen a general kissing an officer before , have you ? " The kissed cadet is the daughter of one of the general 's old Army friends . <P> " If I hear one more call for a meeting about the women or for the women or because of the women , I 'm going to get sick , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , though a report on the Academy puts the matter more formally . " Oversensitivity to the presence of women at West Point on the part of the staff and faculty has been disruptive , serving to alienate the men , foster separatism , and delay the complete integration of the Corps of Cadets . " " It 's the most traumatic thing that 's happened since they took away the horses , " says one unhappy grad . <P> After nearly four years of pressure , the 62 surviving women cadets ( out of the original 119 ) in the Class of ' 80 , the first to admit women , are also fed up with the limelight . " I always try to avoid interviews , " says one emphatically . " I say to reporters , ' Go ask that male cadet the same things . ' " <P> At first it seemed that physique would be the only problem . Most women have less upper-body strength than men . If women are judged by the same physical standards as men , most will fail . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bayonet training , it equipped the women with a lighter rifle , the 6.5-lb . M-16 instead of the 9-lb . M-14 . Separate track and swimming events for women were added to intramural tournaments in place of the contact sports in which women may not take part ( football , boxing and wrestling ) . <P> But many male cadets feel that lowering the physical standards for the women " debased the coinage , " and the women had to pay by being patronized . " Do you know that when they gave us our first leadership ratings , they said things like ' She walks like a girl ' ? " one woman recalls . Women were ridiculed because their voices were higher pitched and not as " commanding . " Their short marching stride was thought unmilitary . <P> And how would the female silhouette look in dress grays ? " They thought the tailed jackets would accent our figures , " says one of the women incredulously . " They thought our big rear ends would stick out , so they gave us no tails . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no trouble spotting them . They were the ones without tails . <P> They had no back pockets either .
