To politicians and cartographers , Syria is an invention of the 20th century . To scholars , however , the term also refers to a once vast , occasionally powerful , always proud empire . Greater Syria , as historians call the broad area east of the Mediterranean , has a long and bloody past . That region , which included the territory of contemporary Syria , Lebanon , Jordan and Israel , was situated at the approximate point where Europe , Asia and Africa converge . As such , it was a traditional meeting place and killing ground for peoples of both the East and the West . <P> Over the millenniums , Syria has repeatedly been overrun by conquerors from the desert or the sea : Canaanites , Phoenicians , Hebrews , Aramaeans , Assyrians , Babylonians , Persians , Greeks , Romans , Nabataeans , Byzantines , Arabs .

To weaken the Arab nationalist movement , the French created contemporary Lebanon by carving from Syria the Christian region around Mount Lebanon , the predominantly Muslim Bekaa Valley and the coastal cities of Tripoli , Beirut , Sidon and Tyre .
