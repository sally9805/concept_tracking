Club Decorator Show House have once again created a decorating never-never land , transforming an elegant but dowdy dowager on Park Avenue into a fresh-faced debutante. // Within the red brick mansion is an anachronistic world devoid of such modern extravagances as spa-bathrooms and computer-equipped kitchens . The decorating , however , is far from traditional . The most exciting rooms are by decorators who have gone beyond the expected period rooms and have mastered a perfection of detail , whether their style is understated or flamboyant. // Textiles are pleated , draped , tied , swagged and embroidered ; walls are marbleized , glazed and stenciled , usually in pale or iridescent colors. // Connoisseurship - the discerning eye that finds the perfect object in its genre - triumphs . Both in size and value , the antiques and artworks on view are gargantuan , ranging from pedigreed period furniture of regal provenance to newly minted pieces that look plucked from the set of " Dynasty. " // Built in 1920 for the Thomas Howell family , the mansion at 603 Park Avenue ( 64th Street ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the few remaining houses from the grand time when the area was known as the Gold Coast . When the designers arrived , the interior was shabby but little changed from its heyday. // The designers respected the spirit of an earlier era . There are eight fireplaces in the house , some of them faux units added by the decorators , but only one television set. // A most successful room is a sitting room envisioned as a hideaway where one would go to think , read or simply stare at the ceiling while surrounded by beautiful , carefully chosen possessions. // " This is where the lady of the house goes to dream and play with tarot cards , write letters , put on makeup and listen to music , " said Perucho Valls , who with his partner Paul Siskin converted two maids ' rooms on the fifth floor . The unusual scene is set by signs of the zodiac painted in gold on a sky-blue ceiling ; a floor of oversize , randomly-laid tiles ; a wide , pillowed divan , and carefully arranged groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn ' t want to be too serious , " Mr. Siskin of the project , Siskin-Valls ' s first foray into the world of show houses . The designers made their point by contrasting such disparate materials as ceramic tile and cut velvet and focusing the small room around a chair in a regal slipcover. // " That ' s soutache , " Mr. Valls said , pointing to the beautifully executed embroidery on the capelike slipcover . " We wanted to bring couture into the interior design business , " he added , fussing with the chair ' s horsehair crinoline as if putting the finishing touches on a bride ' s train. // " It ' s very expensive , " his partner said . " But if you pay $8 , 000 for a couture dress , why not for a chair ? " // Meticulous fabric treatments were also the main theme in Mariette Himes Gomez ' s handsome sitting room , which had pleated linen on the walls , quilted linen curtains and an embossed carpet , in a pale yellow and beige palette . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " I wanted to do a room before 1930 that was 1980 ' s , " said Mrs. Gomez , whose painstakingly detailed fabric techniques give the room its early 20th-century allure . The pair of English Arts and Crafts vases also helped . " Much too good to put flowers in , " said the designer. // Fine things were on many designers ' minds . An imposing black-lacquer 18th-century English Chinoiserie secretary was chosen by Peter van Hattum and Harold Simmons as a visual anchor for the paneled library. // Robert Currie also pursued the idea of a personal retreat , turning a tiny study into " a man ' s room for a person who has ties with the past. " // " This is a room not about decorating but about collecting , " said Mr. Currie . The third-floor room boasts leather draperies and a steel-rolled , sandblasted window . The existing built-in European walnut cabinetry has been credited to the architect Philip Johnson. // " My feeling is that everything is so expensive these days that you might as well buy great things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Very rare 17th- and 18th-century books , one of the great de Kooning drawings , a portrait of Duchamp by Joseph Stella , the quintessential Avedon photograph , and a bronze sculpture by Paul Manship . He did the Atlas at Rockefeller Center. " // A " well-traveled and cultivated " individual was the inspiration for John Saladino ' s room . " His taste is very catholic and he lived in Rome and England for a time before returning home to California , " said the designer of his fictional client. // But although luxuriously appointed , Mr. Saladino ' s drawing room was not stuffy . Rather , the cool and serene second-floor sitting room , all mauve and periwinkle blue , is another deft study of contrasts : silk taffeta and unbleached gauze , Roman antiquities and art by Cy Twombly , the modern painter. // " It ' s a casual room for someone leading a modern life style , " said Mr. Saladino , whose masterful decor was one of the loveliest in the house. // Many of the house ' s original details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Oriental-style landscape panels by Allyn Cox in the dining room and a collection of late-18th-century terra-cotta and black engravings that had been glued on the walls of the fourth-floor study by a former occupant. // " Something impossible to get a client to do , " said Nelson Ferlita of the permanently affixed engravings from which he embarked on a Greek odyssey of his own . The designer commissioned Ron Dier , a ceramicist , to make a four-foot-high amphora , glazed in 24-karat gold , and hung a painting depicting a woman in a Greek chiton by David Ligare , a realist artist. // " No television , no music , " Mr. Ferlita explained . " It ' s all in books , paintings and drawings : a room in which to sit and study and try and learn more about classical design. " // " Fabrics have gone through the roof , " said Noel Jeffrey , who designed the lavish master bedroom . " They used to average $50 to $70 a yard . Now the average price is around $100 a yard. " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antique English four-poster bed , swathed in a king ' s ransom of white satin. // " For me this is a relatively new thing , " he said . " I am from the Bauhaus school , but we ' re all influenced by Christian Lacroix . " Mr. Lacroix , the French fashion designer , is known for his romantic and fanciful clothing. // That might explain why the lampshades are ringed with rosebuds , the dressing table is bedecked in bows and the voluptuous sofa is edged in fringe . " A little fantasy never hurt anyone , " Mr. Jeffrey said. // A couple of decorators had even more regal aspirations . " When I saw them I wanted to be Emperor , " said Juan Pablo Molyneux of splendid 11-foot-high 16th-century Ming cabinets that had to be hoisted in through the dining-room windows . " They came from the Forbidden City and were used to store hats during the reign of the Emperor Wan Li. " // Another emperor was Robert Metzger ' s inspiration for coping with the mansion ' s former laundry room. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistress , Marie Waleska , " said Mr. Metzger , who furnished the room with a French Empire desk and commode valued at $600 , 000 and a 19th-century welded steel and bronze campaign bed. // Although the walls are draped with a wool satin embossed with stars a la Malmaison , Mr. Metzger purposefully didn ' t camouflage the pipes on the ceiling , because " only Americans get crazy if they see things like telephone wires sticking out , " he said. // The decorator also provided the imperial couple with an imposing television set ( the only one in the show house ) and stereo . " A necessity , " he said . " I love antiques , but we ' re living in 1988. " // The 16th annual show house benefits the Kips Bay Boys ' Club , an after-school program in the Bronx .
