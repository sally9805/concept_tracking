Maneuvering to get credit-or dodge blame-for a tax cut may not like the headlines you read , Mr. President . But if we had n't acted , you 'd have seen headlines you liked worse . " <P> That blunt admonition to Jimmy Carter was delivered last week by Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd . The West Virginian was referring to his abrupt decision the week before to flout White House policy by suddenly endorsing a tax cut for next year . Not only had Byrd failed to tell the President he was going to change the party line and advocate a tax cut , he had not notified House Speaker Tip O'Neill . Exclaimed one angry House Democratic leader last week : " The Senate panicked . " Noted another Democratic Representative : " It 's quite a play the Senators pulled . They stole a march on the President too . " House Rules Committee Chairman Richard Boiling said scornfully that Byrd 's action was " proof of how desperately upset the Democrats are . This looks like one of those elections when the Democrats are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byrd 's confident declaration to the President about how he had forestalled hostile headlines for the party was delivered at a breakfast held by Carter at the White House ; it included as guests both the leadership of the Senate and of the House . The discussion was a revealing political confrontation between congressional leaders , acutely jealous of their powers and prerogatives , as they struggled with a tax bill that was bound to have considerable political repercussions in an election year . <P> One of the angriest men at the breakfast was Oregon 's Al Ullman , head of the <P> House Ways and Means Committee , which is responsible for drafting tax legislation . Only days before Byrd 's promise of a quick tax cut , Ullman had said that his committee would not hold tax hearings until January at the earliest . More important , argued Ullman , was the fact that Byrd had usurped one of the House 's most cherished constitutional rights , the provision in Article I declaring that " all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The basic decisions on tax policy ought to come from us . We 're going to insist that the basics be followed . " <P> <P> While the President acted as a benign moderator , Byrd listened quietly to the criticism and then defended his controversial action . He recalled that the G.O.P. , without warning , had tried to attach a $36 billion tax cut advocated by Ronald Reagan to a bill raising the national debt limit . When Byrd and Senate Whip Alan Cranston took a quick head count , they concluded that the Republican measure might attract enough Democrats to pass . Voting against a tax slash , in fact , would be particularly risky to the 22 Democrats up for re-election this November . Byrd faced the sudden and cold reality that the Senate , supposedly controlled by Democrats , 59 to 41 , was about to pass a politically attractive tax cut sponsored by none other than the man who seemed bound to become the G.O.P. nominee .                  @ @ @
