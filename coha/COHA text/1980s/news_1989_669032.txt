P.W. Botha quit under pressure Monday night as South Africa ' s president , complaining that his Cabinet ministers were ignoring him . Botha , 73 , had ruled nearly unchallenged for 11 years . His announcement , delivered in a disjointed and rambling address in Afrikaans on state-run television , followed a Cabinet meeting Monday morning in which he lost a confrontation that he had forced with F.W. de Klerk , his successor as leader of the ruling National Party . At issue was de Klerk ' s right to travel to Zambia later this month to meet President Kenneth Kaunda without getting Botha ' s approval . But this was overshadowed by the almost universal perception that the president had been trying to undercut de Klerk since the latter succeeded as National Party leader about six months ago . Botha said he would not approve de Klerk ' s trip to Zambia because Kaunda had given refuge to the outlawed African National Congress , which is seeking to overthrow the government in Pretoria . " I am of the opinion that it is inopportune to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Botha announced his resignation only 23 days before the next white parliamentary elections , which are the toughest the National Party has faced since it came to power in 1948 . De Klerk has been trying to rally the party against its opponents , the right-wing Conservative Party and the liberal Democratic Party , in what has so far been a lackluster campaign . Had he not stood up to Botha on Monday , his credibility as the leader of a party under fire would have been compromised and the likelihood of becoming the next president diminished . In his remarks on Monday , the president disclosed that de Klerk and his allies proposed at the Cabinet meeting Monday that Botha , who suffered a stroke on Jan. 18 , retire on grounds of ill health . Botha replied that he could not leave " with such a lie " as a pretext . " It is evident to me that after all these years of my best efforts for the National Party and for the government of this country as well as the security of this country , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Botha said . " I consequently have no choice other than to announce my resignation . " Botha did not name a successor . Foreign Minister Roelof Botha , who is not related to the president , indicated in a television interview Monday night that de Klerk would be sworn in Tuesday . The constitution says a Cabinet minister chosen by his colleagues may be acting president . It was expected that de Klerk would be elected president after the elections scheduled for Sept. 6 . In the television interview after President Botha ' s announcement , de Klerk and Foreign Minister Botha both appeared on television to take polite exception to the president ' s remarks . " We are sad that a man who has done so much for his country has to retire under these unhappy circumstances , " de Klerk said . He confirmed that the Cabinet ministers had suggested that Botha resign on grounds of poor health . " We felt that his state of health justified this , " de Klerk said , reinforcing a public perception that the stroke had affected the president more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
