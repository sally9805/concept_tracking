Track fans quickly learned that she had once hoped to be a ballerina but was studying to be a journalist , and in the meantime was the holder of the world indoor best of 6 feet 8 inches , which , indeed , she is to this day. // Miss Bykova and her Soviet colleagues , like Sergei Bubka , never did return to the United States that year because of the Soviet decision to boycott the 1984 Summer Games , but they are back in town for tonight ' s USA/Mobil meet at the Garden. // For Miss Bykova , a totally correct Soviet emissary and also a worldly tourist with an eye and palate for things Italian , this trip has been a chance to reacquaint herself with the complexities of America . Field work , her fellow journalists call it . ( " Please , do you know where to get pizza in New York ? " she asked , and her expressive eyes lit up when a Western scribbler said he could even recommend a cappuccino machine or two . ) The return of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sergei Bubka in complaining publicly about conditions at pole-vault competitions and also openly comparing himself favorably to his rival and friend , Billy Olsen . Bubka is all athlete , including his roguish smile and the white sweater around his powerful torso . Miss Bykova , by contrast , is a model of urbanity , in a fashionable pin-striped jacket and skirt . At the track meet luncheon in the swank Library of the Helmsley Palace on Wednesday , Miss Bykova and her translator , Ludmila Potanich , could easily have been representing a Madison Avenue public-relations firm. // At 5 feet 10 1/2 inches and a svelte 137 pounds , Miss Bykova is one of more noticeable representatives a nation could send forth . Her coach , Igor Ter-Ovanesyan , a former world-level jumper , said during her 1984 visit : " I think she is a classic beauty . Besides that , she can jump. " // At the age of 27 , Miss Bykova is working toward a graduate degree at Rostov State University , preparing to be a broadcaster . She represents her country well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the American hosts arranged a team visit to Broadway , and innocently chose " On Your Toes , " never giving a thought that Galina Panova had recently replaced another former Soviet ballerina , Natalia Makarova. // While Miss Panova was dancing , Miss Bykova was heard to whisper , in English , that Miss Panova seemed over the hill. // Miss Bykova had aspired to be a ballerina , but her height and athletic ability led her to the Institute of Physical Culture , where she attained a degree as a coach . At the same time , she wrote sports features for the newspaper in Rostov-on-Don , the city on the Sea of Azov . Miss Bykova is a southerner who shivers at the mention of Moscow winters. // Because she had worked on camera as a journalism student , Miss Bykova evolved as a spokesman for the Soviet athletes following the decision , in May 1984 , to skip the Summer Games. // She was shown wearing a track suit outside Lenin Stadium , reading what appeared to be a prepared text , talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Frankly speaking , the facilities and conditions weren ' t bad , but in recent times things have changed sharply for the worse , " she said. // Suffice it to say that Miss Bykova felt comfortable enough on this California journey to enjoy the splendor of the Coronado Hotel in San Diego ( it reminded her of Italy ) , and she was also treated to an insider ' s tour of a Hollywood studio. // That tour came about while she and teammates were training with Dwight Stones at Ambassador College in Pasadena . Stones introduced them to Tony Dow , the actor , once known as Wally Beaver on the television series " Leave It to Beaver. " // Dow took them to the set of a show called " Legal Eagles " and introduced them to several actors , including one actor Mrs. Potanich , a rare interpreter-with-a-smile , termed " the glamour boy . " Miss Bykova decided she preferred Russian men. // Miss Bykova said this is a more positive time for sporting events , after the United States and the Soviet Union have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not talk about the political side of it , " Miss Bykova said , " but last year the U.S. and Japan and the U.S.S.R. competed in Japan and we really enjoyed being together again . Then we all went to Canberra for the World Cup , and again I can say that we enjoyed ourselves . " This summer the Soviet Union will stage the Goodwill Games in Moscow from June 5-20 , with financial support from the Turner Broadcasting System . Miss Bykova expects to be seen on camera as a competitor , but broadcasting is not far away . She is three years from her best heights of 6-8 for the world indoor best and 6-8 3/4 for her best height outdoors . Last year she had the second-best outdoor jump at 6-7 1/2 , 2 inches behind the world record of Ludmila Andonova of Bulgaria in 1984 . Tonight she will try to beat Debbie Brill , the recent winner in New York , Los Angeles and San Diego. // " In New York , conditions were not so good and I was thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flown in from Moscow two days earlier. // " In Los Angeles , I just ran through it , but in San Diego I had plenty of rest and I felt good , " Miss Bykova said in her English , which she protested was not very good. // " On my big jump , I stopped at the edge and I said to myself , ' Bykova : to be or not to be ? ' I did my best result of the season and I was happy. " // After asking Hamlet ' s immortal question , she jumped 6-4 , which placed her second. // The Soviet athletes are competing against some American " amateurs " who pocket huge fees and live the good life . The Soviet athletes are fully subsidized , and live well , but their federations handle the track money. // " Different system , " Miss Bykova said , adding that Carl Lewis had " changed a lot " after his Olympic success and the money it brought. // Miss Bykova has not changed since the night she won the silver bowl as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words of her coach , she is still a classic beauty , she can still jump - and she still represents her " different system " with dignity. //
