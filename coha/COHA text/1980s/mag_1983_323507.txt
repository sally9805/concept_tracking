A controversial Senate building may be worth the price after all <P> During a decade of planning , building and bickering , the $137.7 million Philip A. Hart Senate Office Building has been much denounced as a wasteful , Mussolini-style marble barn . Now that it is essentially completed and ready for occupancy , some Senators have declined to move into it . Wisconsin 's William Proxmire and others object that it is too opulent . John Stennis of Mississippi and Charles Mathias of Maryland say they prefer the old-shoe comforts and fireplaces of their present quarters . With most of the Senate leadership setting a good example , however , the marble barn 's 50 office suites have all been assigned . Says Majority Leader Howard Baker , the first to move in : " I approved the design as a member of the Senate Public Works Committee . I want to be the first to enjoy its advantages . " <P> The advantages are considerable . The 1.1 million-sq. - ft. colossus is not , to be sure , the kind of building to wrap your heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit intimidating . Yet the building fits politely between the clumsily classical Everett Dirksen Senate Office Building and the Federal and Queen Anne-style Sewall-Belmont House and garden , headquarters of the venerable National Woman 's Party . The Hart Building 's classically well-ordered , box-construction windows , reminiscent of Le Corbusier 's famous brise-soleils , or sun screens , harmonize with the forest of Roman columns that flourishes on Capitol Hill . Most important , of the six congressional office palaces built in the 20th century , this is the first to make 20th century functional sense . <P> Part of the credit for this goes to George M. White , who , after being appointed Architect of the Capitol in 1971 , decided that Roman pomposity had become a Capitol embarrassment . White stopped further encroachments on the surrounding residential neighborhood . He commissioned a master plan for development of the congressional campus within its existing boundaries . And when a third Senate office building became necessary in 1972 ( supplementing the Dirksen and Richard Russell buildings ) , he spurned the short roster of traditional architects who had worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Associates for the job . <P> Warnecke , based in San Francisco , had won national acclaim for his ability to design buildings that do not flaunt their modernity but get along well with older neighbors , notably two office buildings opposite the White House whose brick facades effectively echo the residential accents of surrounding Lafayette Square .
