NEW YORK  --  The foreign-exchange market brushed aside central-bank intervention to slow the dollar ' s rise amid further speculation that there ' s an international monetary-policy rift between the U.S. and West Germany .

The Bundesbank intervened at the Frankfurt dollar fixing by selling $40 million but didn ' t intervene in the open market . The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was spotted intervening twice in the New York market , but dealers said the two U.S. interventions were small and unaggressive . In what has become almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments designed to clarify the policies of the German central bank but instead added a new note of confusion . Helmut Hesse , a member of the Bundesbank ' s policy-making central-bank council , said in a speech that German monetary policy shouldn ' t be used to bring the dollar down because this might result in conflicting international interest-rate policies and uncontrollable movements of capital . The Hesse remarks were confusing to many market participants who believe the German government wants a high mark to fight inflation and must raise interest rates to support the currency . " Hesse lent a bit more confusion to the situation , " said Bob Hatcher , corporate dealer with Barclays Bank in New York . He added that Bundesbank officials repeatedly have said they want a stronger mark to combat German inflation .

" He ( Hesse ) also said a conflict in interest-rate policies is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bundesbank ) would like to raise interest rates to slow down the economy and get inflation under control . The U.S. wants the dollar to remain steady or slightly stronger to combat inflation . There is a conflict , with each nation wanting to combat inflation . " On the other hand , Robert Hormats , vice chairman of Goldman , Sachs International in New York , dismissed the significance of a possible policy rift . " It is hard to read individual statements into a trend , " Mr. Hormats said . " The dollar is strong because , in the absence of any other news , the investor looks toward interest rates . Whether the rates go up or down is less critical than the interest-rate differentials . These statements are less significant than differentials . " Mr. Hesse ' s comments came hours after Federal Reserve Board Governor Wayne Angell said at a Tokyo economics symposium that the Fed will remain committed to fighting inflation through higher U.S. interest rates despite the twin U.S. budget and trade deficits . Mr. Angell further stated that while the Fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of the dollar , " the main focus of the Federal Reserve is countering inflation .
