The locals defy their leaders <P> No industry has suffered more in the current slump than steelmaking . Once the backbone of the nation 's industrial might , steel firms have seen sales plunge to the lowest levels in 24 years while unemployment has leaped to an alarming 37% of the work force . <P> Though steel has been plagued over the years by everything from strong foreign competition to outmoded mills and plants , the industry 's biggest headache remains exorbitant wages , which now average $23.40 per hr. , including benefits . That makes unionized steelworkers the most highly paid blue-collar laborers in American industry . <P> Though industry executives and union leaders alike realize that high wages are hurting the industry , efforts to improve the situation have consistently failed . Last summer the 30-member executive board of the United Steelworkers of America took up the idea of a wage freeze to help stop mounting layoffs and return the industry to profitability . But the feisty leaders of the union 's 600 local chapters rejected the proposal . <P> Last week U.S.W. President Lloyd McBride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just for a wage freeze but for what would have amounted to an unprecedented pay and benefits cut of nearly 10% in the first year of a new multiyear contract . The deal would have required the U.S.W. , in effect , to tear up its existing two-year-old contract , which does not formally expire until next August , and sign a new 45-month contract under which the steel companies would set up generous profit-sharing plans for U.S.W. members . <P> Once again , however , the U.S.W 's local union chieftains said no . At week 's end , after more than four hours of heated closed-door debate , they voted the plan down , 231 to 141 . Said McBride afterward : " I am disappointed , obviously . I would have preferred a settlement . But the wisdom of the majority is what we go by . It was a judgment call . " <P> For the foundering industry , the rejection could not have come at a worse time . Steel executives have been counting desperately on an economic recovery beginning next spring to help boost steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if demand for steel does improve , the companies could wind up losing if they have to negotiate a new contract with the U.S.W. as sales and profits are starting to recover . For both labor and management , the ultimate disaster would , of course , be a strike . It would open the door to a surge in foreign imports , bringing yet more anguish to the bleeding industry .
