All of these honorees felt a special emotion , of course , but perhaps the moment was even more meaningful for some whose names might not immediately ring a bell with today ' s fans. // // As former Navy star Ron Beagle put it : ' ' I ' m glad there are some old-timers on the board ; nobody else would remember me ! ' ' // That ' s a bit of an exaggeration , to be sure , for anyone who followed college football in the 1950s certainly hasn ' t forgotten the great end whose play sparked the Middies for three seasons and led them all the way to the Sugar Bowl in his junior year. // Beagle was a consensus first team All-American in both 1954 and 1955 , and in the former year he received the Maxwell Award as the nation ' s outstanding player . But like most military academy stars ( especially in that era ) , he went on to complete his service commitment in the normal fashion rather than try to squeeze in a pro career - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 30 years. // ' ' The thing I notice most today is the size of the players , ' ' said Beagle , now a businessman in Sacramento , Calif . ' ' Everywhere you look they ' re 6-5 , 6-8 , 280 pounds . How do they grow ' em so big ? ' ' // But even in his own day , Ron conceded , most of the other guys looked big to him . ' ' In high school I was a peanut - 5-11 and 160 , ' ' he recalled . ' ' Bear Bryant , who was then at Kentucky , said I was too small . So did Sid Gillman and a lot of other coaches. ' ' // Ron proved them wrong , though , beefing up to 185 or so at Navy and leading the Middies to a lot of big victories , including a 21-0 decision over Mississippi in the 1955 Sugar Bowl. // Another star of the ' 50s who was a big name in his own heyday but may not be too well remembered by younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State at both quarterback and safety ( they still played both ways in those days ) , he too won the Maxwell Award and was second to Billy Cannon of LSU in the voting for the 1959 Heisman Trophy . But he played only a couple of years in the pros - in the infant days of the old American Football League - and thus also hasn ' t been making any headlines for a long , long time. // It is their very distance from the spotlight , though , that sometimes makes such players the most perceptive observers . And indeed both Lucas and Beagle had some interesting comments on the problems of the modern game - problems that have come to national attention on a wide scale lately through revelations of academic abuses and/or recruiting violations at a number of institutions. // ' ' Without a doubt it ' s been out of control , ' ' said Lucas , who is now assistant athletic director at his alma mater . ' ' Those in authority have to take the necessary steps to control the situation , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they ' ve started doing it. ' ' // Lucas pointed out that the abuses which are getting so much attention these days are hardly any novelty. // ' ' Some of the things we ' re seeing probably occurred a long time ago , ' ' he said . ' ' There just wasn ' t as much general knowledge of what was going on . Before the TV era , things were much more regional . Each conference had its own way of doing things , and there wasn ' t the sort of national publicity there is now . So the abuses are much more obvious today , but these problems aren ' t all new. ' ' // Speaking from the viewpoint of a college administrator , Lucas took issue with those who would solve the problem by de-emphasizing sports . He pointed out that big-time programs have positive as well as negative aspects , noting that it is the revenue-producing sports like football and basketball which help support a lot of other athletic activities on campus. // ' ' We do have to control abuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think you ' re seeing this happening . The authorities are taking charge now . College presidents are taking over some of the responsibility . The vast majority of coaches want to control things . So do the athletic directors , and so does the NCAA . It ' s just common sense. ' ' // Beagle agreed that things have reached a point where steps have to be taken , and he singled out recruiting as the main culprit. // ' ' A lot of schools go overboard , ' ' he said . ' ' It ' s difficult to put a handle on it . Each school tries to offer more than the other one . If you ' re going to control the situation , you have to put some curbs on recruiting , but it ' s not going to be easy.

But despite his relative proximity to the spotlight , interestingly enough , it was the former Ohio State and Cincinnati Bengals star who offered one of the most heartfelt expressions of what this ultimate honor meant to him. // ' ' This is the greatest honor that could ever happen to a man who played college football , ' ' said Griffin , who is now an assistant to the athletic director at his alma mater . He added that he wanted to express his gratitude to the many individuals who had helped make it possible. // ' ' I think back on how I was brought up , ' ' he said , pausing to introduce his father . ' ' I had six brothers and a sister , and my parents were very supportive of all of us . They gave me direction , they taught me trust in God , and they encouraged me to get a college education and to participate in athletics . Athletics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to get up when you ' re knocked down. // ' ' I think , too , about my coaches in high school and in college , ' ' he said , praising his controversial former Ohio State mentor , Woody Hayes , as ' ' a great , great coach , and a great person too - that ' s how strongly I feel. ' ' // ' ' Finally , ' ' he said , ' ' I think about the teams I played for . A great group of guys who all came together to make some great teams , and who came very close to the national championship all four years I was there . Without those guys , Archie Griffin wouldn ' t be here today. ' ' // //
