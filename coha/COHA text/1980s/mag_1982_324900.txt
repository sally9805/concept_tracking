" You declare that you are ' punishing ' Israel . What kind of talk is that , ' punishing ' Israel ? Are we a vassal state ? A banana republic ? Are we 14-year-old boys that if they do n't behave they have their knuckles smacked ? <P> &gt;You have no moral right to lecture us on civilian casualties . We have read the history of World War II , and we know what happened to civilians when you carried out military operations against the enemy . We also read the history of the Viet Nam War and your term ' body counts . ' <P> &gt; You can not and will not frighten us with ' punishments and threats . ' Threats will fall on deaf ears . <P> &gt; You are trying to make Israel hostage to the memorandum of understanding . No sword of Damocles will be hanging over our heads . The people of Israel have lived for 3,700 years without a memorandum of understanding with America and will continue to live without it for another 3,700 years . ' <P> &gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process you have broken the word of the President . What do you want to do ? Hit us in the pocket ? <P> &gt; Nobody will succeed in intimidating American Jews by anti-Semitic propaganda . They will stand by us . This is the land of their forefathers-they have the right and duty to support it . <P> &gt;The word rescind is a concept from the time of the Inquisition . Our forefathers went to ' the stake ' rather than rescind their faith . We are not going to the stake . "
