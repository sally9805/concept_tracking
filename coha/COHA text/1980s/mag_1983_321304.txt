Cranky voters deal the Christian Democrats a surprising blow <P> With the notable exception of the Communists , Italy 's fractious political parties had good reason to regret last week 's national elections , if only because the results left the country more difficult to govern than ever . The last parliament produced six coalition governments in four years . As if they had been asked once too often to settle such incessant power struggles , the electorate this time delivered what amounted to a stunning protest against the government . The major victims of the voters ' pique were the Christian Democrats , who have led or dominated every one of Italy 's 43 postwar governments . They lost close to 2 million votes and plummeted nearly 6 percentage points from 38.3% of the vote in 1979 to 32.9% , the lowest level in their 40-year history .

Still , that was not nearly the gain that Party Leader Bettino Craxi had hoped for when he provoked the elections , a year ahead of schedule , by pulling out of Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani 's coalition government last April . Several small rightist and centrist parties also increased their share of the seats . <P> The unprecedented shift away from the Christian Democrats reflected voter frustration , but it failed to give the country a new governing direction . As the politicians mulled over the election results and resumed their intricate maneuvering , there seemed to be no realistic alternative to another five-party center-left coalition that may turn out to be as fragile as its predecessors and lack the cohesion to impose the economic rigor the country needs . Inflation is at 16% while unemployment , at 10% , continues an upward march . More urgent is the necessity to slash runaway public spending to reduce a threatening $60 billion 1983 budget deficit . The prospect of a series of weak coalition governments is already stirring speculation about the need for new elections in a year or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said a Western diplomat : " Once again the Italians are at the brink .
