Ethel Devore was watching a television news program at 11 p. m. on Mother ' s Day when police knocked at her door and told her the neighborhood was being evacuated . About 24 hours later , Devore was making the news rather than watching it . Among more than 200 people left homeless in the city ' s worst residential fire , tears streamed from her eyes as she watched her neighborhood , and her dreams , go up in smoke . " I just cried , I couldn ' t even think , " she said Tuesday . " We didn ' t have no raggedy shacks over there . We had a nice place , with a patio and all . " Her neighborhood had been characterized by neatly kept row houses on tree-lined streets on the western edge of Philadelphia . The names of residents had been etched on the doors of many homes . Each house had been painted a different color with distinctive looks that included Victorian and colonial fronts and bay windows . But that was before what Mayor W. Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and MOVE , a self-styled back-to-nature fringe group . Now the neighborhood looks like postwar Berlin . The streets that once fronted the rows of townhouses were piled Tuesday with debris from those houses , about 60 of them . On Osage Street , where MOVE ' s compound was located , and on the next streets over , only the walls were standing in some units . They were chipped and scorched . City officials estimate damage at $5 million , but Devore said no amount of money would replace her loss . " It ( the house ) had sentimental value , " she said . " My boy is 18 years old ; ( in the house ) I had his first pair of shoes bronzed . I had the first outfit I had put on his back . I saved my 13-year-old daughter ' s first dress . " I had old pictures . What am I supposed to do , say , ' Aunt Ruth , get up out of the grave and let me take your picture ? ' They took 24 years and destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Small , 19 , lived a block away from the fire with her parents until their house was demolished . " When I walk up and down the street , it feels like I ' m at home , " she said Tuesday , still in a state of disbelief . " But when I turn around and look at what used to be my house , I can ' t believe it . It looks like it was eaten up . The fire ate it up . " Small landed a job as a cashier Monday and thought it would be her lucky day . It turned out to be anything but that . " I thought I was pretty lucky until I saw that , " she said , referring to the fire . " I got a job the same day my house burned down . Now I don ' t have anything to wear to work . " Rescue operations were in full swing by late Tuesday . A special disaster center established to assist fire victims was set up in a nearby recreation center , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up cots , and area hotels provided free room for some of the victims . Some people were housed at a Temple University dormitory . Small said she was offended by MOVE and had wanted the group evicted from the area . " The house was filthy because they had a lot of dogs around it , " she said . " It was smelly , but I would have rather they stayed than for this to happen . " But resident Cassandra Carter refused to blame the mayor or other city officials even though she had lost her home . " I don ' t blame Goode , " she said softly . " I blame MOVE . " In blaming MOVE , she was pointing to a cult unlike any other . First , the letters in its name do not represent an acronym . Second , the sect prides itself on living in harmony with nature  --  but not with people . Members eat only natural foods , many of them uncooked . They refuse to clothe infants and shun the use of soap . A major feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All of them list their last name as Africa . Better known for being odd than violent , MOVE was established in 1972 as a result of an alliance between Vincent Lopez Leaphart , a black third-grade dropout who later adopted the name John Africa , and Donald Glassey , a white college instructor who holds a master ' s degree in social work . Others were recruited to the group , which was first called the Christian Movement for Life , then Community Action Movement and ultimately MOVE . Under its guiding principles , any form of government represents an unwanted intrusion on individuals , and modern technology is blamed for society ' s degeneration . MOVE members pride themselves on living close to nature , spurning tap water and electricity  --  except what is needed to power loudspeakers  --  and leaving their garbage on the ground to be recycled into the earth . Instead of soap , MOVE members use a herbal mix that includes garlic . They routinely take in stray dogs , also considered one of nature ' s gifts , and feed rats that assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims to be against technology , the group dropped its early creed of nonviolence and began arming themselves with automatic weapons and enrolling in self-defense courses during the mid-1970s . The first clash with Philadelphia officials came in 1975 , when the city filed suit against MOVE after receiving complaints about rats , fecal odors and building-code violations . A year later , the group charged that police had killed one of its member ' s children , named Life Africa . But MOVE refused to turn the body over to authorities and declined to allow an autopsy . Donald Glassey , the white co-founder , turned government informant as the group switched from being integrated to a small all-black fringe group that numbered about 50 . Glassey told police of a cache of weapons at MOVE headquarters . In late 1976 , police began an around-the-clock surveillance of the headquarters that lasted 10 months . By early 1977 , 11 members of MOVE were charged with weapons violations . In their longest standoff with police , MOVE members remained barricaded inside their house for nearly a year , from May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left after accepting a 10-point agreement calling for them to surrender to authorities and vacate the house in exchange for a farm in southern New Jersey . Three months later , when the group still had not moved , a shootout occurred that ended in the death of one police officer . Following a five-month prosecution , nine members of MOVE were convicted of third-degree murder and imprisoned . In Monday ' s violent confrontation with police , MOVE members demanded the release of those colleagues , but authorities refused to release them . CAPTION : MAP : Site of siege and fire .
