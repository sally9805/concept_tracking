For stock-market watchers , the Dow Jones Industrial Average is a bit like the magnetic North Pole . It isn ' t a perfect gauge of direction , but it provides a quick , handy bearing . The Dow Jones industrial index dates back to 1896 , making it the oldest continuously published barometer of the U.S. stock market . The average currently consists of 30 blue-chip stocks in industries ranging from oil to computers . " To most people outside Wall Street , the Dow is the market , " says Ralph Acampora , chief technical analyst at Kidder , Peabody &; Co . Still , finance professionals often prefer more detailed indexes in following stock-price trends . In particular , many money managers use the Standard &; Poor ' s 500-stock index as a benchmark for their portfolios . " It ' s more representative of the stocks they own , " explains Kidder ' s Mr. Acampora . Other broad indexes include the Wilshire 5000 , the Russell 3000 and the Nasdaq composite . No matter what the index , though , the recent rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indexes have increased by similar amounts . So far this year , the Dow Jones Industrials have climbed more than 100 points , to yesterday ' s record 2002. 25 . Meanwhile , the S &; 500 has risen 6. 2% in 1987 , to a record 257. 28 . And the New York Stock Exchange composite index is up 6. 5% , to 147. 55 . The Dow Jones industrial index is computed by first adding the prices of all its constituents . These range from International Business Machines Corp. , at about $122. 875 a share , to Navistar International Co. , at $5. 375 a share . All totaled , the prices come to about $1 , 780 . This total is then divided by the " Dow Jones divisor . " The divisor currently stands at 0. 889 , thus producing an index slightly above 2000 . The divisor ' s value is adjusted periodically so that stock splits and substitutions don ' t in themselves change the value of the index . Market professionals say the industrial average is valuable as a short-term measure of market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly being traded , so you can get a good picture of the market ' s trend in as little as three or four minutes , " says Kelly Houghton , a vice president at the pension consulting firm of Frank Russell Co . But the 30-stock base of the industrial average sometimes doesn ' t reflect everything going on in the market . All the stocks in the Dow have large market capitalizations , notes Mr. Houghton . Yet , he says , " there are times when small stocks are going the opposite way . " He adds that the 30 industrials are largely in mature industries , with limited emphasis on service stocks . Another objection to the industrial average and other Dow Jones indexes is that they weight stocks on the basis of price . Most newer indexes assign weightings on the basis of total market capitalization . The difference is small in the short run , but a price-weighted index can overstate the importance of high-priced stocks , while giving too little weight to stocks that remain low-priced because of frequent stock splits . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Salomon , a managing partner at Salomon Brothers Inc . The original Dow Jones Industrial Average was just 12 stocks . The index was gradually expanded in the early 20th Century , reaching its current size of 30 in 1928 . Since that time , about three dozen substitutions have been made , mainly to replace companies that were taken over . In the most recent changes , in late 1985 , McDonalds Corp. and Philip Morris Inc. replaced American Brands Inc. and General Foods Corp . " The index has got better in the past couple years , " says John Mendelson , head of market analysis at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc . Though the index may be narrow , it does have long-term continuity , he notes . By contrast , the S &; in its current form dates back to 1957 , while the New York Stock Exchange composite was created in 1966 . " No single index can tell the entire story about something as complicated as the stock market , " says Charles Stabler , an assistant managing editor of The Wall Street Journal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indexes , too . " He says that Dow Jones continues to provide its stock indexes because familiarity and long-term continuity have given them a wide investor following .
