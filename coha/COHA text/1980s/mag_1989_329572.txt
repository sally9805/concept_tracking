In Colombia , where 157 judges were victims of drug-related murders between 1982 and 1988 , it is a brave justice who stands up to the cartels . But last week , in a surprising move , the country 's Supreme Court voted to uphold most of President Virgilio Barco Varga 's emergency measures against narcotics traffickers . Most important , the court approved the President 's power to extradite criminals to the U.S. <P> Since Barco began his crusade against the coke barons eight weeks ago , one drug lieutenant has been extradited and the U.S. Justice Department has begun to pursue four others . " This is a great victory for the President and a tremendous blow to the narcos , " declared National Police chief General Miguel Gomez Padilla . <P> Gomez Padilla had another reason for optimism . He disclosed last week that more than 4,000 police officers had left or been dismissed from the 70,000- member force this year , many because of connections with drug traffickers .                @ @ @ @ @
