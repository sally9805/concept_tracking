Regulating the news ? <P> <P> Incensed by a Reader 's Digest article suggesting that Senator Edward Kennedy had lied about Chappaquiddick , a volunteer worker in his presidential campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission . Identifying herself as " a concerned citizen , " Larryann C. Willis of Vale , Ore. , accused the magazine of making corporate campaign contributions in violation of federal election laws . <P> She alleged three separate infractions : <P> commissioning a computer study on how fast Kennedy was driving when his car went off the bridge , drowning Mary Jo Kopechne ; buying a study of the tides off Chappaquiddick that night in July 1969 ; and distributing videotapes of the computer re-enactment of the fatal accident to major news organizations . <P> A hearing on the case is set for this week . The FEC has already ruled that paying for the two studies was not illegal . <P> But the commission found " reason to believe " that the Digest had violated election law by sending out videotapes to promote its February 1980 story . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move , seeing it as an ominous Government encroachment on press freedom . <P> Reader 's Digest refused to answer 15 questions from the FEC , claiming protection under the First Amendment and pointing out that news stories were exempted from campaign contribution restrictions . The magazine asked a New York federal district court for a preliminary injunction against the FEC investigation . Argued the Digest : " The fact of being investigated by the United States Government for alleged violation of a statute carrying criminal penalties has a chilling effect all by itself . " Such investigations , it added , " can be a very effective form of censorship . "
