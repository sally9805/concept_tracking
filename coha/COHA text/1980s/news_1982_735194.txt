txt The recent decline in world oil prices has created an unexpected obstacle to Alaska 's plans to build a host of capital projects across the state . Citing a steady erosion in the price of North Slope crude oil , Alaska Department of Revenue officials have reduced their projections for state revenues by more than S2 billion for fiscal 1982 and 1983 . Instead of the $9.62 billion in oil revenues that they predicted in June , state officials now are suggesting that lawmakers will have only $7.45 billion to dole out during the next two years . The shortage is particularly alarming because legislators have already appropriated about $600 million from fiscal 1983 revenues . In addition , the legislators last year appropriated about $350 million more than the state currently is expected to receive this year , requiring that even more money be taken from fiscal 1983 revenues . " Revenues have gone down and down and down . " complained Ron Lehr , director of the state 's Division of Budget and Man-agement A number of economists believe that world oil prices could further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is almost 1007 , dependent on oil revenues . " I think the state 's current revenues estimates are substantially high in light of continuing softening in the oil market , " said Gregg Erickson , a Juneau consultant who correctly predicted a large shortage last year when state officials were forecasting only a minor price drop Mr. Erickson said the market price for North Slope crude conceivably could fall to 1979 levels  --  one-fourth to one-fifth of the current price of $20 a barrel . " There is a large chance for very , very disastrous results from the state 's point of view , " he said . Arlon Tussing , a Seattle economist agrees . " The Department of Revenues is continuing to forecast on the basis of much higher prices than anybody else 's forecast , " he said . Both Messrs . Erickson and Tussing said that the same factors that created the current world oil glut , and consequently reduced oil prices , are likely to continue unabated in the coming few years . Among the reasons they cite for the glut are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch to alternative fuels . slowing world-wide economic growth and increased domestic oil production . Thomas Williams , the state 's revenue commissioner , said he thinks the state revenue projections now are conservative . But he said it is " very plausible " that oil prices could further decline . Mr Williams defends his department 's earlier optimistic forecast , noting that most economists were surprised by the recent price collapse . " We were in very good company , " he said .
