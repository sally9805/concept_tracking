ZERO db By Madison Smartt Bell good sound man A is someone who drives to work at twenty miles an hour . Well , that 's what they say . I am a sound man , though not necessarily and not always a good one . But I work . Correction . Until approximately seven o'clock this evening , I did work . Twenty miles an hour . We may assume that that implies meticulousness , a close attention to detail , and great patience , near absolute . Though some people say it merely means that a good sound man has his trunk full of expen sive tape recorders . Now I am sitting in a bar on Fourteenth Street . I am here and come here often because of the bartender , who remembers what I drink ( shot of bourbon and a beer chaser ) and pours it for me without my having to ask . Ever . What you might call a high-fidelity memory . Ordinarily I sir at the bar , where the service is faster . But tonight I am sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scats in the booth are dark red vinyl , stained near black with smoke and spillage and age . Between them is a brown Formica table . There is very little light . On the table is a shot glass and a beer glass , each half empty . A couple of cigarette filters I have stood on end because there seems to be no ashtray for me to put them out in . And at the very edge of the table , a Nagra Ill tape recorder , my pride and joy . The Nagra is sealed up in its black leather case . This is so no one will realize that I have several thousand dollars ' worth of tape recorder here , because if they did , they might try to take it away from me . Now the tape recorder is running , and I am recording the sound of my own voice . I am using a lavalier microphone , about the size of a button on your shirt . Too small for Madison Smartt Bell 's new novel , Waiting fur the End of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fields . anyone to notice , and besides , I have it cupped in my hand , practically inside my mouth . The lavalier is plugged into the line input on the side of the Nagra , and the headphones are plugged into the front . If anyone is watching , they may think I am listening to the radio . Not so . The tape is running at 7.5 i.p.s. , hi-fi not being a great issue here . Between one reel and the other the tape crosses three heads : record , sync ( not now in use ) , and playback . Thus I hear my own words a half-second after I say them . This situation can cause problems for novices , making it near impossible for them to talk , but I am accustomed to it . I am whispering so softly that without the Nagra I could hardly hear myself . But with the Nagra , I can boost the signal . The needle on the VU meter is flicking just short of zero db , the point it must always approach but never reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , the tape will be saturated . The tape will have received more information than it can absorb , and my words will degenerate into noise . As it is , my whispering is loud and clear , what I imagine the wind might sound like if it could shape words . I am hunched over the table , holding up the case flap with my thumb , peeping in at the front panel of the Nagra , where the VU meter and the level controls are . Above these instruments I can also see the three tape beads under clear plastic , with the rape running so reliably across them . The heads are , quite simply , beautiful . The face of each one resembles a little Mondrian painting . And the whole of the Nagra is beautiful as well . It is an apotheosis of form following function , the best tape recorder made . The Nagra will not fail . Except , of course , in case of operator error . It occurs to me that my greatest hope and am-bition might be to emulate this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for being very bad day for me . Listen , and I will tell you what happened . A week ago I finished a documentary shoot for Harold Brinks , Harold usually makes commercials . He is well suited to commercial shoots , where all the conditions are under his control and he can bully the cast and crew to his heart 's content . But he is eminently unsuited to documentary work , where the conditions can not be controlled and bullying is inappropriate . Especially a documentary shoot in a mental hospital . I do n't know why he decided to do it . Harold is a connoisseur of Good Things . Good Food , Good Wine , Good Music , Good Art selected by a Good Decorator on the walls of his Good Location in midtown . Maybe he thought it was time to go in for Good Works . I do n't know and 1 do n't care . I hate Harold , a stupid , venal man whose bad temper is his most valuable stock in trade . Harold is rather fat , balding , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose comes out in a big sweeping hook , then chops off at the end as though maybe it has suffered some sort of accident . Harold 's nose makes him look like a tapir . I work for him because he pays . But there 's a limit to everything . This morning Harold calls me up and displays his bad temper and says that the sound from the shoot is a mess . Which I already know , because Harold had a cameraman who would n't take direction , so there was no direction , so I had to run tape hour after hour while the cameraman shot when he felt like it . Now Harold has discovered that there is a ten-to-one sound/picture ratio and no slates , and his intern ca n't sync up the rushes ; in short , he wants me to come up and do it . Well , I would call that about a week of work , and I could use the money . Sure enough , it is a mess when I get on Harold 's flatbed . An hour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I 'm patient , meticulous , attentive to detail . I sit there watching picture for three hours , looking for a clue . Then I find it . On the screen is a woman 's Face . Her mouth opens and closes ; her throat throbs . Although I can not hear it , I know that she is screaming . It takes another hour to find the scream on all that tape . But when I find it , I enjoy it . The scream is pure , almost melodious . I am pleased to find that because I twiddled the knobs correctly when I taped it , it did not overload . Now I know where to begin . After the scream there is a cut to a man talking . I watch his mouth until his lips shut firm . The speech on the tape goes like this : " Listen . Listen . Listen . Anybody here that 's got something to say ... " Anybody . Body . B. A letter where the mouth must close . I sync up , play back --  -- it works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By six-thirty I 've synced up about twenty minutes ' worth and put it on cores for coding . I pack up and get ready to leave . Harold comes boiling out of his office . " Where you think you 're going ? Is it finished already ? " " Of course it 's not finished , " I say . " But I 'm an hour into overtime . " " What overtime , " Harold says . " This situation is your responsibility . It comes under your fee for the shoot . " " Oh no , " I say , and I sit down , " Oh nu , Harold , I do n't know how to tell you this . " " Tell me what ? " he says . " Your nose , Harold , " I say . " What happened to your nose ? Did it get caught in a door somewhere ? " Harold begins to turn purple . " Or did somebody maybe bite off the end of it one time ? Could that have been what happened ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a heart attack . " You look a good deal like a tapir with that nose , " I say . Harold is still inarticulate . " A tapir is a South American pig , " I explain . " It has a nose sort of like a little trunk . In case you did n't know . That 's what I 'm talking about . That 's what your nose looks like , a tapir 's nose . " That was the end of my employment with Harold , and probably with all of Harold 's friends , who unfortunately are numerous and have given me a lot of work . That was an example of what Rosemary , to whom I will place a telephone call quite soon , would call self-destructive behavior . Operator error , perhaps . I 'll have another drink . Getting back to the table , I see that two when I do this , like the microphone is being stamped on . But once I have it in place I can hear what the two men are saying . " So why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes like Bruce Lee , I forget his name . " " Si Mung , Did n't you hear ? He 's no good anymore . Been out of the picture for four , Five weeks . " " Did n't hear that . He get hurt ? " " He went mental . I thought you would have heard about it . Whole town must be laughing . " " No . " " O.K. Remember that guy , Greg Tate ? Lives out Flatbush Avenue . Biker . Kept a dog , a monster Doberman . Would kill you . Like a wolf , that dog . " " Have n't seen him around , recent . " " You probably wo n't . See , Greg had been owing us money . For months . Since even before we had Si Mung . He was hard to get to because of the goddamn dog . Which was attack trained . A dog a cop should have . Greg sirs our on Flathush Avenue , he laughs when we call up . " Si Mung , he works for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people four or five times we did n't hardly have to use him anymore . People knew . They would just pay up , no prob-lem . " " That , I did hear . " " But , Si Mung ... a very cold guy . I never much liked to watch him work . Like a machine ripping into somebody . It was weird . " " Self-control . " " Self-control like that , it makes me nervous . But he was sitting around , not much to do . So I talk to him about Greg Tate . Just , you know , see what he thought about it . And he goes into this heavy Chinese silence of his . Then gets up and says , O.K. " O.K. what , I say . I mean , what about the dog ? How are you gon na handle it ? 1 mean , Ido n't want the dog to eat you or something . " Si Mung says , I do n't wan na hurt the dog . That 's all he says . Goes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe he was a dog himself . " So I think , O.K. , I 'm a gambler , right , I get in the car , drive Si Mung out Flatbush Avenue . Greg Tate is sitting right out there on the stoop . Got the dog on a leash , spiked collar on the dog . Greg got on a collar too , looks about the same . Si Mung gets out the car . Me , I stay in , Motor running , too . " Si Mung stands out on the sidewalk . Does his little Chinese breathing thing . Greg shakes the leash and the dog pulls our to the end of it and hangs there snapping at the air . More teeth than a shark , that dog . " Si Mung looks up , says , I do n't wan na hurt the dog . " Greg laughs . Si Mung takes a step up the stairs . Dog comes off the leash , teeth everywhere , and Si Mung , I see this , puts his hands into the dog 's mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dog , and rip , the dog is running back up the steps . Howling . Si Mung broke his jaws , see . Had his hands cut up a little and that was all . Greg starts in the house after the dog , going for a piece we found inside later , and good thing he never got to it , a sawed-off shotgun . Si Mung caught him in the doorway . Kicked in a knee , broke his right arm , broke his left arm . Laid his head into the doorpost and slammed the door on it till Greg Tate got no face left anymore . I mean , it was fiat , where his face used to be . " " That 's too much . " " Do n't tell me . I get out the car , try to stop it , say , Si Mung , money 's all we want , not dead people . But he did n't stop rill , I do n't know , he got tired or something . He turns around and says , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crazy . Like you said . " " Do n't tell me . We got out of there dean , at least . Greg 's in the hospital , never gon na pay anybody anything , maybe he 's gon na die . But what the hell , it 's an example for people . But Si Mung . He sits around the club a week , wo n't do anything , wo n't even say anything except , I did n't wan na hurt the dog . Si Mung , I say to him , you wan na eat , you wan na drink , you wan na shoot up , you wan na go out and beat somebody to death maybe ? He says , I did n't wan na hurt the dog . Like that . " Week of this , I say , O.K. , let 's go see about the goddamn dog . Back out Tate 's place we find the dog lying down cellar , about half starved to death . Si Mung picks him up like he was a baby , carries him back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the dog soup . And ever since that 's the way it 's been . Si Mung 's good for nothing but making the dog soup . Even the dog is good for nothing anymore . All he can do is eat soup . It 's a mess is what I 'm say-ing . How should I know what to do ? " line . I press the suction cup down over the earpiece of the phone and set the level to the dial tone . Now I will be able to record this important call . And listen to it at half-second delay . I hear the coins fall . then the tones that represent the numbers . And now the phone is ringing . Three times . " Hello , " Rosemary says . I listen . I can hear her breathe . " Hello ? " 1 wait . expectant . " Whoever you are , " Rosemary says , " do n't call again . " Dial tone . Back in the booth it seems better to think about the dog with its broken jaws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that it will . Water is lipping up to the lower rim of my eyelids and running down my face . I look around the hat , but no one notices ; what I especially like about this place is that no one notices anything unless you hit someone . Through the headphones I can hear myself saying words like " Why will no one help me ? " and " I 've failed , I 've failed . " These words come back to me at half-second delay , fixed already on the tape and in the past , and they sound ugly and fatal . And the tape is overloading , distorting into noise . Operator error . I turn the level down . Over and over , 1 repeat new words : I did n't want to hurt the dog . I did n't want to hurt the dog , And I feel much better . Twenty miles an hour . Perhaps I have only been going too fast . I stop talking , turn the level up . The background sounds of the bar fill up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slow shuffling of feet . Room tone . On the lids of my closed eyes I see images . I sec the woman screaming in the film with all the force and power she can summon , without making the least sound . I see the dog lying on the basement floor , breathing painfully , inaudibly , through his ruined jaws . I see that Rosemary and I are walking arm in arm along a brick waterfront pier . The sun is low on the water , its reflections too painful to regard . Fat gulls swoop shrieking all around us . I see how the water meets the edge of the pier so precisely , no hint of drop or gap between them , the land dovetailed so smoothly into the sea . I open my eyes , adjust the level . When I speak , the needle flicks toward zero and trembles exactly there , its perfect limit . I have just one thing more to say . Listen . Listen . Listen . We can never be too attentive to our world . ?   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
