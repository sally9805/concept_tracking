The U.S. is one of a handful of nations that permit the death penalty for offenders who committed crimes before the age of 18 . Only three juvenile killers have been executed since the Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976 , but 29 remain on death row . This term , the court was expected to settle the question of whether the Constitution forbids such executions by considering the case of William Wayne Thompson , 21 , an Oklahoma inmate who was 15 when he helped murder his former brother-in-law . <P> When the decision came down last week , however , the result was less clear cut . Four Justices  --  Blackmun , Brennan , Marshall and Stevens  --  ruled that the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment forbids capital punishment for any offenders who committed their crimes before reaching 16 . Three others  --  Rehnquist , Scalia and White  --  said the Constitution posed no such barrier . Justice Kennedy did not participate . <P> The decisive vote came from Justice O'Connor , who ruled narrowly that Oklahoma could not carry out such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its death-penalty law . O'Connor stopped short of ruling on whether juvenile executions would be constitutional even in states that expressly permit them . That saved Thompson , but it left the larger issue at a standstill . The court has promised to review the question next year when it considers the cases of two other inmates on death row for crimes committed as juveniles .
