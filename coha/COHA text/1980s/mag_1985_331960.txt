Since 1978 , General Dynamics Corp . has faced a series of accusations that it bilked the Government of hundreds of millions of dollars in construction-cost overruns for the Trident submarine . Last week it was disclosed that the nation 's largest arms manufacturer , with $7.2 billion in military contracts last year , had withdrawn $491,840 in charges to the Defense Department for air travel by its chairman , David S. Lewis , and other executives . The bill included 76 flights that Lewis made in Sabreliner and Gulfstream III company jets from General Dynamics headquarters in St. Louis to his farm in Albany , Ga. , and 67 flights he made to San Francisco and Wichita to attend board meetings of other firms where he served as a director . <P> Lewis ' charges were a fraction of the $22 million in air-travel costs between 1978 and 1983 that General Dynamics had billed and Pentagon auditors have challenged . The company insists that Lewis ' costs " were proper under the terms of ( our ) contract . " Said a corporate spokesman : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the claim was the adverse and untrue publicity which has surrounded this issue . " Said a Pentagon official : " We 've read about it , we 've heard about it , we 're studying it . "
