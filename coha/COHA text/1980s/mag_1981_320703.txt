Needed : major changes in Government-but not constitutional surgery " Habit is habit , and not to be flung out of the window by any man , but coaxed downstairs a step at a time . " <P> - Mark Twain If there is one political belief that Americans cherish as an article of faith , it is the belief that their system of constitutional Government is the best ever devised by the mind of man . Yet an increasing number of citizens seem to share a contradictory view-that the system is not working . The evidence takes diverse forms . There are widespread demands for several differing constitutional amendments . And after the usual blizzard of declarations that every ballot is crucial , only 53% of the eligible voters went to the polls last November , the fifth voting decline in a row . <P> Opinion polls , the nation 's favorite medium of public confession , document the erosion of Americans ' faith in their system . Pollster Louis Harris has been asking over the years how many citizens believe in a series of statements like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens to you . " <P> The number who subscribe to this " index of alienation " has climbed steadily , from 29% in 1966 to 44% in 1972 to 58% today . The University of Michigan 's Center for Political Studies asks opinions on similarly glum statements : " The Government is pretty much run by a few big interests ... Quite a few of the people running the Government do n't seem to know what they 're doing ... " The alienated again rise sharply , from 19% in 1964 to almost 60% today . <P> Just as Oscar Wilde once remarked that the youth of America is its oldest tradition , much the same could be said of complaints about the failings of the U.S. political system . George Washington grumbled that " the stupor , or listlessness with which our public measures seem to be pervaded , is , to me , matter of deep regret . " Through all the criticism , the mere fact that the system has survived more than two centuries of turbulent change is the strongest possible evidence of its solidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of inefficiency , the best defense is that it was not designed for efficiency but for accommodation and consensus . That , indeed , is the key to its survival .
