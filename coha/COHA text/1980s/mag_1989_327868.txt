On the once pristine shores of the Antarctic Peninsula and nearby islands , a vast oil slick has become a tide of death . The spreading film has killed thousands of krill , the tiny shrimplike crustaceans that are a major food source for fish , birds and whales . Oil-soaked penguins are in danger of freezing to death , and nearly all of the skua chicks have died . <P> As teams of divers from the U.S. and South America struggled last week to plug a hole in the Argentine ship Bahia Paraiso , which had sunk and was leaking 3,000 gal . of fuel a day , squadrons of scientists rushed in to assess the damage caused by Antarctica 's first major oil spill . " This is the worst ecological disaster for Antarctica , period , " says James Barnes , general counsel to the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition . It is sure to stoke the already heated debate over the future of development , tourism and mining in Antarctica . <P> The calamity began on Jan. 28 , when the captain of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tourist boat , sailed through waters identified on charts as having " dangerous ledges and pinnacles . " The ship was shaken by a " terrible jolt , " says passenger Nadia Le Bon . " I thought we hit an iceberg . " Instead , the ship had struck Full Astern Reef , which ripped a 30-ft. gash through its double hull and into the engine room . With the ship listing and the smell of gasoline thick in the air , the 314 passengers and crew members were rescued unharmed by scientists in small boats from the U.S. research center at Palmer Station , a mile away . But the ship began leaking its 250,000 gal . of oil and spilling cargo , including drums of diesel and jet fuel and tanks of compressed gas , from its deck . <P> The shipwreck is one result of the largely unregulated growth of Antarctic enterprise . Says Peter Wilkniss , head of the National Science Foundation 's polar programs : " We are witnessing the dawn of the commercial age in Antarctica . " Thousands of tourists are flocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only 400 people visited Antarctica , but in the week before the Bahia Paraiso hit the reef , more than 500 visitors passed through Palmer Station alone . And Antarctic tourists are doing more than sailing to research centers for short visits and lecture tours . In 1988 , 35 adventurers paid $35,000 each to set foot on the South Pole , and this year another group is skiing 600 miles to the bottom of the world . " Tourism really needs to be regulated , " says Mary Voyteck , a scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund . <P> Whatever happens to tourism , the devastation from the oil spill could be a serious setback to the idea of oil and mineral exploration in Antarctica . Last May , 33 nations drafted an agreement that would eventually open the area to mining and drilling . That treaty , which the U.S. Senate will consider for ratification in the next few months , is vigorously opposed by a broad coalition of environmental groups . Any hopes that the Senate will approve the agreement may have sunk with the Bahia Paraiso. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
