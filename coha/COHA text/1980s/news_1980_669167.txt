The chief executive officer , Lee Kuan Yew , has the title of prime minister . The board of directors is composed of 10 members called ministers . Mr. Lee ' s administration has been efficient and scrupulously honest . The result in terms of growth and development  --  spectacular. // During the 20 years Mr. Lee has been prime minister , Singapore has changed from a traditional Chinese town into a city of skyscrapers and carefully manicured lawns and gardens . Sixty-four percent of the population of 2. 3 million now lives in public housing . Tourism , once unknown , florishes . Industries have sprung up like mushrooms after a downpour . The port is one of the largest in the world. // In 1979 , gross domestic product was up 9. 3 percent , compared with 2 percent for the United States and an average of 3. 25 percent for the industrialized members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . The main thrust came from manufacturing , transport , and trade . Inflation is 4 percent ; unemployment , insignificant. // How was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The government controls everything and intervenes everywhere . " It ' s like a partner , " an industrialist said . " They want to know what you are doing . " Another put it this way : " Mr. Lee is like a daddy . He is anxious about his children , and industries are his children. " // Mr. Lee is not the kind of a person to take " no " for an answer . Violations are punished by murderous fines , imprisonment , and caning . The prime minister ' s People ' s Action Party manages to win regularly all seats to Parliament , despite there being other parties . An American insists that elections are fair . " Nothing succeeds like success , " he said , " and Mr. Lee is being very successful. " // There is a lot of grumbling around Singapore . People complain about the way the prime minister does things , but there is little objection over the substance . The more important newspapers are in English . Their foreign coverage is excellent ; on internal matters they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are 34 political prisoners . They were sentenced for advocating the violent overthrow of the government . When they promise to abide by the rules , they are set free. // Mr. Lee attributes his country ' s success to two main elements : // 1 . Its society is cohesive . Class divisions , though they exist , carry no stigma and do not hinder free mobility up or down the socioeconomic ladder . Talented children of all classes make their full contribution to national progress. // 2 . Workers in trade unions are not locked into antagonism against management or the establishment. // " Singapore ' s society , is young and supple , " Mr. Lee stated . " It is not homogeneous ; but like other immigrant societies , such as America , it has no sharp class divisions . . . . We have the rare opportunity to mold and shape our society into a harmonious whole. " // The country is small , hence manageable . Continued advancement is creating a basis for confidence . People also remember the time , not long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predominantly Chinese city to go under. // Unlike most other countries of Southeast Asia , Singapore has no xenophobic hangover from colonialism . As a consequence , the island has never suffered from any inhibitions in borrowing capital , know-how , managers , engineers , and marketing capabilities . There are some 12 , 000 foreign managers , engineers , and technicians here , or 20 percent of the total work force in these categories . They and their enterprise in manufacturing , services , and commerce help to employ about 30 percent of the total work force . Out of 462 export-oriented industries established between 1960 and 1978 , 253 were wholly foreign , 159 joint ventures , and only 50 wholly Singaporean. // Having examined the performance of socialist planning in a number of countries , Mr. Lee opted for free enterprise in a free market economy . Older factories whose products had a high labor content were moved out of the country . The government is doing everything to encourage and facilitate the shift to higher value-added , skill- and technology-intensive industries. // Said Goh Chok Tong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition guarantees us against inefficiencies . . . . We will not protect our industries and local businessmen through state subsidies or the erection of tariff walls . Our industries and local businessmen must compete with the best in the world . They will thus become equal to the best . They must . Our market is the world , not Singapore. " // The government has decided that over the next three or four years wages will be increased by 20 percent yearly . The objective is to give notice to employers that wages will be used as a policy instrument to upgrade the economy , to compel more efficient use of the island ' s scarce , valuable manpower , and to spur investments in high- value , high-productivity industries . The aim is to become another Japan. // Situated in one of the most troubled parts of the world , Singapore views with grave concern the spread of Soviet influence . The Vietnamese invasion of Laos and Cambodia , Indira Gandhi ' s pro-Moscow leanings in India , and the invasion of Afghanistan cause the gravest concern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , and Western Europe to face up to what he warns is approaching : a " Soviet century . " He told some Japanese that the Soviets have " won the first cold war , and the question is now whether the US , Western Europe , and Japan will provide coherent leadership to the free world in the second world war. " // Singaporeans are particularly disconcerted about the US . They feel it no longer has the will to lead , to defend the noncommunist world . An official said Singapore is an " anxious friend " of the US : " We would like to tell the Americans , ' Do not abdicate . The whole of Southeast Asia is with you . Do not blind yourself to the larger concerns . Show once again that you have a political will. ' " // The official said he felt that Washington ' s human-rights campaign only serves to give confused signals : " You seem to find more faults with your friends and allies than with the communists . Accept the world as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While the communists trample on human rights , you divide friends and allies . You influence can be effective , if discreet . The way the campaign was conducted initially left a very bad taste . Be careful about national sensitivities . Do not give the impression of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. " // For the past 20 years , Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew has given Singapore an intransigent and authoritarian leadership that has been almost universally accepted because the results were remarkable. // The problem is , after Mr. Lee , what ? So rapid an economic development can not go without social changes that will affect a traditional society like the Chinese . For now , problems have been shoved under the rug , but in the long run they are sure to emerge . Nothing is done to prepare the succession . Singaporeans are largely happy with the present , but anxious about the future. // //
