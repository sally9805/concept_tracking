In retrospect , it seems as though the intersection of Lower Landing Road and the Boston &; Maine Railroad in the village of Charlestown , N.H. , was a disaster waiting to happen . Visibility is restricted on the approaches to the grade crossing , there are no blinking lights or automatic gates and trains come through infrequently enough to lull motorists into a false feeling of security . A man could drive across the tracks 30 times and never see a train ; after a while he might begin to think he never would . But Charlestown had , in fact , experienced an inordinate number of grade crossing accidents - five in 1977 alone - for a town with a population of less than 2000 . Still , people were not particularly concerned about the grade crossing . Certainly trains were the last thing on Detlef Chobotor ' s mind at 4:30 on the morning of May 1 last spring . Chotobor , an industrious 32-year-old immigrant from Germany , was used to getting up early . He had a good job in a machine shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Blue Bird trailer park knew him as a man who was always willing to help out ; a man who never considered a piece of work finished until it was done right . He owned property in nearby Alstead and planned to start building a house there as soon as the mud season was over . To help make ends meet , his 23- year-old wife Nancy had just started a job as a waitress at the Keene Ramada Inn - in addition to raising their four daughters . There was more than a little bumping and confusion when the family piled into Chobotor ' s Ford Bronco at 5 a.m . It was still pitch dark , but the eastern sky behind Fall Mountain began to pale as Chobotor drove into Charlestown on Route 12 . He turned onto Lower Landing Road , crossed the B &M; tracks , and continued on to the Lower Landing mobile home park , where he dropped off his oldest daughter Anna with a friend who would look after her until school started . It was now almost 5:15 . Chobotor turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few minutes earlier , Amtrack Number 60 , the northbound Montrealer , had made its stop in Bellows Falls , Vt . As usual , the train was running late , but it would probably make up time . With just seven cars in tow , the single diesel had more than enough power for the fast track ahead . The train eased across the Connecticut River into North Walpole , N.H. , and accelerated sharply . The locomotive ' s flashing blue strobe lights created an eerie effect when they were switched on just south of Charlestown . The train began to blow for the Lower Landing grade crossing , which was still invisible around a curve . The air horns rapped out the familiar two long blasts , a short and a long . Suddenly the air horns blared again , a horrifying , desperate screech , and in that final second Detlef Chobotor must at last have seen his peril . It was too late . The impact hurled the Bronco 50 feet against an embankment ; Choboter , his wife and three children were killed instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ground to a halt some 1100 feet down the track . There was hardly a mark on the nose of the engine . The timing had been crucial . A few seconds one way or the other - it was almost like a roll of the dice . It didn ' t seem fair . It didn ' t have to happen . But it did . A train had struck a car . Five people were dead . It was not an act of God or a bolt of lightning ; it was a train . Somebody must be responsible . Was the train going too fast ? Had the crew been negligent ? And then attention focused on the grade crossing itself . People remembered that there had been problems . Suddenly the crossing seemed very dangerous . Why had nothing ever been done about it ? You had to be right on the track , it was said , before you could see if a train was coming . One man recalled this very thing happening to him on another crossing in town . He saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The more people thought about it , the more they wondered why there were no flashing lights on Lower Landing Road . That was the crux of the matter . There should have beenlights . There should have been an automatic gate or a bell or something . It would have saved Detlef Choboter . The evidence defintely pointed toward that conclusion , but in order to accept it as absolute fact , one had to ignore both human nature and a disturbing set of statistics collected by the Federal Railroad Administration Office of Safety . Of the 11,700 grade crossing accidents in 1976 , nearly half took place at crossings equipped with flashing lights , gates or traffic signals . So mechanical warning devices , it seems , are hardly a fail-safe means of preventing disaster . Motorists do not see the lights , or they simply disregard them . Others come to a stop and then proceed directly into the path of a train . Still others drive around or through the lowered gates . Even more astonishing , however , is the fact that of the 11,700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking a car , but a car or bus or a truck striking a train . In 3348 instances , motorists actually drove into the side of a train that was already on the crossing . But what really happened at Lower Landing Road ? At the moment of impact the front wheels of Detlef Chobotor ' s Bronco were across the track . The vehicle was hit squarely on the passenger ' s side by a 120- ton locomotive traveling at 47 mph . The train ' s headlight - a headlight so brilliant you can not look at it directly - was illuminated , the strobe lights were flashing , the bell was ringing and the air horns blowing . Lower Landing Road itself is a narrow two-lane blacktop used only by local traffic . The posted speed limit is 25 mph . The road intersects the single B &M; track at a 90 degree angle . There are large railroad crossbuck signs as well as advance warning signs . If a motorist is approaching from the west - as Chobotor was - there is also a standard red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this stop sign , visibility to both the left and the right is severely restricted by trees and houses . Once a car is even with the sign , however , the driver can see down the track several hundred yards in either direction . The statement that you have to pull out onto the track to see a train is not true . But you do have to stop . According to local residents , a lot of cars do not . Incredible as it may seem , there are motorists who think it is too much trouble to stop at a grade crossing . Did Chobotor make this fatal mistake ? Did he run the stop sign ? If so , it would explain why he apparently failed to see the train . That was the conclusion reached by the official investigation , but there are other possibilities . Perhaps Chobotor stopped and looked and still saw nothing . It was a cold morning and the windows of the Bronco might have been fogged . Or perhaps he saw the train and thought he had time to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will not bring Detlef Chobotor ' s family back to life . If only there had been warning lights . This is the point the newspapers stressed over and over again . More than half a year has passed and there are still no lights at Lower Landing Road . There should be . They are needed . But warning lights alone can not prevent another tragedy . Lights or no lights , the ultimate responsibility for avoiding accidents rests with the individual . For some reason people have trouble accepting that . Responsibility has never been very popular , though it is hard to say whay after you have seen the appalling alternative .
