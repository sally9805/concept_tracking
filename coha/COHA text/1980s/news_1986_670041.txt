GTE Corp. ' s proposed joint venture with Siemens AG of West Germany to make telephone switches in the U.S. is taking longer than anticipated to negotiate amid indications that the transaction might fall through . Stamford , Conn. - based GTE , whose executives last January said they hoped to reach a definitive agreement this month , said it could be the middle of the year before an agreement is reached . Discussions " are going a little more slowly than anticipated because of the complexity of the issues involved , " a GTE spokesman said . He wouldn ' t elaborate . A spokesman for Siemens ' s telephone switching business in Boca Raton , Fla. , acknowledged that " there is always that possibility " that a definitive agreement to form a joint venture won ' t be reached . Analysts and consultants in recent days have speculated that the proposed joint venture may be in jeopardy , in part because of Siemens ' s extraordinary success in getting orders from Bell telephone companies spun off from American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. in 1984 . Siemens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with GTE is to bolster its U.S. presence by selling switches to GTE ' s 15 domestic local telephone companies and three telephone companies in British Columbia , Quebec and the Dominican Republic . " I think it ' s very possible that the thing will just fall through , " said Sean White , president of Northern Business Information Inc. , a New York-based research firm that follows the telecommunications equipment industry . " There are so many points of contention . " Among the unresolved issues cited by Mr. White are : which company ' s existing switch the joint venture should market ; which company ' s executives will head the proposed venture ; and whether GTE ' s current manufacturing operations in Northlake , Ill. , should be part of the venture . Currently , Siemens is having its EWSD switch shipped from West Germany for trials at the Bell operating companies . Its current plans call for it to initially manufacture the switch in the U.S. in Cherry Hill , N.J. , beginning in 1988 . In recent interviews , Siemens executives from the Boca Raton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in getting some Bell system orders . Four of the seven regional Bell holding companies have agreed to try out the Siemens switch , and Ameritech has agreed to include Siemens as a third bidder when it asks for bids this summer on $100 million of new telephone switching equipment . The hotly competitive business of selling switches to the Bell concerns has already forced ITT Corp. to shut down its U.S. phone switch operations . Volker Jung , senior vice president of Siemens ' s U.S. public switching division , said he is " still optimistic and positive " that a definitive agreement with GTE will be reached , but " it takes time . You know how touchy things like joint ventures are . Negotiations are going on and I don ' t know what the results might be . " The venture has hired consultants McKinsey &; Co. to get the Bell concerns ' reaction to the combination , indicating that the proposed venture is having problems , industry sources said . While the combination might help Siemens sell to the GTE companies , it won ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the lion ' s share of the market . " There isn ' t any added value that we see being brought by " the proposed venture , said Bruce DeMaeyer , president of Ameritech Services , which buys for Ameritech ' s companies . Ameritech is impressed with Siemens ' s capital commitment to the U.S. market and would be concerned if the venture continued making GTE switches because that would weaken its commitment to the Siemens switches Ameritech wants , he said . While Siemens may be using its early U.S. success to mold the venture to its needs , GTE actually has a bigger world-wide market share , analysts said . Last year , GTE sold about 8% of new digital telephone lines installed world-wide , compared to Siemens ' 6% share , Northern Business ' s Mr. White said . Siemens , on the other hand , has nearly $7 billion in cash , some of which would be available for the costly research and development needed to support sales of increasingly complex phone switching gear .
