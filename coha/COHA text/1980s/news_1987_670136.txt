The dollar plunged to another post-World War II low against the Japanese yen yesterday as currency traders turned a cold shoulder to results of the Washington meeting of the world ' s top finance officials . The U.S. currency slid to 144. 20 yen despite intervention by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York . Traders also interpreted comments by Treasury Secretary James Baker as negative for the dollar . The dollar ' s performance prompted strong reactions in many other financial markets . U.S. stock and bond markets had sharp declines , precious metals and commodity futures prices rose , and Tokyo stock prices climbed . Some foreign exchange traders attributed the pummeling of the dollar to what they called an apparent willingness by the U.S. and its major economic allies to allow the currency to decline further . They expressed doubt that central bank intervention would be able to stop the sell-off .

The Paris accord was aimed at stabilizing exchange rates among the U.S. , Japan , West Germany , France , Britain and Canada . But despite that agreement and intervention to prop up the dollar by those countries , the U.S. currency has continued to fall . Mr. Vick said the finance ministers ' reaffirmation of the accord Wednesday night " was conspicuous for omitting any specific , significant actions to support the dollar .

The dollar ' s decline against the West German mark also could push that country toward proposing a stimulus package of its own , something it has resisted doing so far . A continually declining dollar would squeeze Japan ' s already cramped export industries and slow its economic growth further .
