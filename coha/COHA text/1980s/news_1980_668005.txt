Not if the situation around Greater Boston is any indication . Although the plight of the urban horsekeeper is real , it is by no means unmanageable - witnessed by the fact that at most larger stables on the North Shore , at least one-third of the boarders live in Boston or its immediate suburbs . The phenomenon isn ' t surprising , given the marked rise in the horse population of primarily urban states - nor is it confined to Massachusetts alone . National figures released last year by the US Dept. of Agriculture and the American Horse Council show that in the past 15 years , the number of horses in this state has increased 500 percent . In other urban states , the increase is similar or even higher : 2000 percent in Rhode Island ; 1000 in Connecticut and California ; 700 in New Hampshire , 500 in New York , Florida and Illinois ; 400 in Michigan and New Jersey . Twenty-five states had a 100-to-300- percent increase . The horse population rose in 49 of the 50 states . While the additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city or suburban backyards , most are boarded in the country while their owners live in or near the city . It ' s a syndrome comparable to the commuter situation in the job force , especially in this region . People work in Boston where the pay is better , but prefer to live in the suburbs . Riders live and work in Boston for the same reason , but they ride in the country because , well , it ' s obvious . There are , admittedly , a number of stables within 5 or 10 miles of Boston - some of them even reachable by MBTA and transit buses . However , they generally do not offer the extensive facilities and open space available at " horse country " stables . The high expense of maintaining a horse is in itself a major reason why many horse owners are city dwellers . Horses are not an inexpensive hobby . Owners need the higher income afforded by city jobs , and often prefer to live near their place of work . Although one does see the occasional pony in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted police in the streets of Boston , that ' s about the extent of it . So how does a city person go about " horsekeeping " ? First , you have to decide whether it is more important to you to live near your job , home , or horse . This is predicated by the amount of hours you spend weekly riding and caring for your horse , and the time of day you usually ride . If you ' re strictly a weekend rider , it won ' t matter much one way or the other what type of arrangements you make . But for a serious equestrian , stabling arrangements are an important consideration in one ' s daily routine . If you work in Boston proper , it is foolish to keep your home south of the city and your horse north of it ( or vice versa ) . Heavy commuter traffic , particularly along downtown city streets and major routes , can strictly limit the times you can travel to and from the stable . If your schedule is flexible , fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( It ' s easy enough to make excuses not to ride - " too cold , " " too windy , " etc. - without adding a traffic problem to the list . ) Some people find it more convenient to head straight for the stable after work . But if you work 9 to 5 , you may be arriving at the barn just as the horses are being fed . Then you ' ll have to wait another hour while yours eats and digests before you can ride , so it may be better to spend the time doing chores at home and arrive at the stable after supper ( and rush-hour ) . The question of feeding has another aspect : Should you board at an all- service stable , where you pay for the luxury of having someone feed your horse , or should you do the job yourself ? Most riders with fulltime jobs find it a necessity to have someone else do the feeding and stall-mucking on a daily basis . The horse has to be taken care of at set times every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a workday , you still have to make time to do your barn chores before reporting to work . If you work overtime one day and get caught in rush hour , you are obligated to travel to the barn to make sure the horse has his supper ( before you even have yours ) . Therefore , the all-service stable is the best bet for riders who can afford it . Horse care doesn ' t come cheap but , as in most other matters , you get what you pay for . Expect to pay a minimum of $150 to $200 per month for a decent stable with the services you ' ll need . This usually covers only flat board - the stall , feed , and stall cleaning , plus use of most facilities on the premises . You are responsible for grooming , training and exercising your horse . Full board , which includes any variety of these extra services , costs anywhere from $250 to $500 per month in this area . The specific area you choose to stable your horse around Boston must also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the better dressage and eventing barns are on the North Shore , which is not surprising since the US Equestrian Team is headquartered in Hamilton . South of Boston , in the BlueHills and toward Carver , there are some fine trailriding stables with literally hundreds of acres of trails available . Hunting stables are found both north and south . There and to the west of Boston are many all-purpose stables , some of which offer riding lessons and training . You have to shop around , keeping in mind whether you want to ride for show or pleasure . You may decide to opt for a not-so-convenient stable because the instructor there is worth the drive . ( I drive 50 miles round-trip daily from Boston to Danvers because of the coach , but have managed to form a carpool with other riders from Cambridge and Arlington . ) It is not worthwhile to choose a stable on convenience alone - if you don ' t enjoy the barn , you won ' t ride as often . Conveniences such as an indoor riding arena may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable . With New England winter on our doorstep , an indoor ring is invaluable at this time of year . Many riders also prefer the indoor hall in the summer , as it keeps out rain , flies and heat . In the winter , you lose probably at least 30 days of riding due to inclement weather if you do not have indoor facilities . A lighted indoor hall also affords you the opportunity to ride after sunset . Most barns are open to their boarders until 9 p.m. daily - and some even later , particularly if the trainer there still has horses to work or lessons to teach . With the barn open later , you have more flexibility in when you choose to ride , but if lessons are scheduled late this may affect your plans . Most indoor riding halls are large enough to be divided in half or even in thirds , allowing a lesson in one end and free riding in the other . However , if your training program requires use of the full arena ( for example , to run through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adjust your riding time to when the barn is least busy . If such considerations are too much a hindrance to you , there is always the option of living in a Boston suburb with zoning that allows you to keep your horse on your property . A makeshift two- stall barn and small turnout area in the backyard does suffice for some Boston-area horsemen . However , it entails feeding and cleaning both morning and night . You also miss the camaraderie of being stabled with other riders , and you do not have an instructor/ trainer on the premises . It is , admittedly , the least expensive way to maintain a horse , but in terms of time and inconvenience it is extremely costly . You might want to devise a boarding situation that allows you to keep the horse at your home most of the year but board him winters at a facility with an indoor hall . Many barns allow this , but they book up fast ( especially now ) and often charge higher rates for strictly a winter boarder .

This may require some juggling of your life around riding by a revision in work place and times , or even home location . You just have to assess the variables to find what works for you . Then , shop around at area stables . Following is a partial list of some of the larger boarding stables in the Greater Boston area , with their minimum rates for flat board ( covers only stall rent , stall cleaning , feed and use of most facilities ) . Some stables also require boarders to take a certain number of lessons per month . Facilities and services vary , but available at most are : indoor riding hall , outside dressage ring and jumping courses , turnout area , adjacent trails , lessons , training and showing. * PLEASE MAKE THIS STUFF UNDERNEATH BENDAY NORTH Floating Trot Farm , Putnam lane , Danvers , 774-9476 .
