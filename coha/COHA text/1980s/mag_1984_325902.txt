Under fire , Mondale orders some PAC money returned <P> For Walter Mondale , the frustration mounted at each stop . From a VIP lounge at the Baltimore-Washington airport , he put in a telephone call to Lane Kirkland , only to be told that he was away from his office . Mondale tried twice more , from the Columbus airport , and finally reached the AFL-CIO president . Mixing sternness with pleading , he told Kirkland to halt the flow of money that unions were funneling into Mondale 's effort through supposedly independent groups called " delegate committees . " Said the former Vice President : " I really have to make sure it 's stopped . " <P> But the issue refused to go away . In Tennessee the next day , more than half the questions at a press conference dealt with the money flowing from political-action committees ( PACs ) to his 127 delegate committees . Retreating to his suite at the Nashville Hyatt Regency Hotel with Senior Adviser John Reilly , the Democratic front runner exploded , " This is getting to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to let go of it . " After a flurry of calls to his Washington headquarters , Mondale ordered that the delegate committees be disbanded Immediately . Said he : " I just want to get rid of them , period . " <P> The noisy debate over the delegate committees and their PAC money at times threatened to submerge the substantive issues of the campaign . The amount of money in dispute is probably no more than $500,000 ; Mondale is expected to spend a total of $24.2 million before the convention . But more than technicalities were involved . The controversy undercut the pledge Mondale made early in his candidacy that he would not accept PAC contributions and raised anew questions about how beholden he is to organized labor . Mondale took the matter so seriously that when Colorado Senator Gary Hart began taunting him for not actually returning the funds ( " Give the money back , Walter-that 's the way to solve the problem " ) , the former Vice President agreed to do almost exactly that . He announced that he will order the delegate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , totaling about $300,000 . <P> Delegate committees , which were first permitted in the 1976 elections , are groups formed by prospective delegates pledged to a particular candidate . The money they raise is not counted against the candidate 's spending limits . But the groups must operate independently , without assistance from the candidate 's authorized campaign staff .
