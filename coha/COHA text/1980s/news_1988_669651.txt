The medical profession insists that the health service is in crisis because of inadequate funding . It doubts Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ' s assurances that the health service is ' ' safe in our hands . ' ' And public emotions have been stirred up against what is seen as an ' ' uncaring ' ' policy. // // Some observers suspect Mrs. Thatcher wants to dismantle the most popular institution of the Britain ' s post-war welfare state since it conflicts with her vision of a free-enterprise society. // In a recent protest march in London , some 50 , 000 health service workers called for increased government spending on the health service . In February , nurses protested with an unprecedented one-day national strike demanding higher wages. // These demonstrations have followed several months ' of heart-tugging press reports of babies and children awaiting medical operations because of long hospital waiting lists . Some of them died after delayed operations were performed , and , in heated parliamentary debates , Thatcher has been blamed personally for their deaths. // The health service has become voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polls conducted for London ' s Sunday Times earlier this year. // A poll conducted by the Observer newspaper found some 74 percent of voters would like more money spent on health care in the government budget to be announced tomorrow - even if it means foregoing promised tax cuts. // ' ' People love the National Health Service , ' ' says Dr. John Marks , chairman of the executive council of the British Medical Association , a professional organization which represents the nation ' s doctors and nurses . ' ' But our morale is bad , and the nurses ' morale is worse . We have a service that has been chronically underfunded , the buildings are falling apart , the equipment is not sufficient , the staff morale is going down . It ' s kept going by the dedicated nurses and doctors. ' ' // Thatcher rejects arguments that current funding , $38 billion a year , is so inadequate as to undermine the quality of patient care . Her approach has been to review management and require more accountability of the medical profession for money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government spending on health since she came to power in 1979. // Britain ' s national health program was once admired as a model among Western democracies for its efficiency and egalitarianism . In the immediate post-war years , it ranked among the top five industrialized nations in its health care spending as a percentage of gross national product . Although its health spending rose from 3. 9 to 5. 9 percent between 1960 and 1985 , Britain now ranks second from the bottom in this measure among industrialized countries as other nations have increased health spending more rapidly. // In recent years , medical costs and demand for health care have risen sharply . Government figures show a doubling of health costs over the past decade , in which drug prices have more than doubled. // Pressures on the service have increased as the average age of Britain ' s population has become older , demanding more health care , and as new medical technology offers treatments unavailable in the past. // These developments have contributed to waiting lists and times which doctors say are unreasonably long . The latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , show some 687 , 945 patients on hospital waiting lists for England ( not including Wales and Scotland ) . Of these , some 29 , 992 patients were ' ' urgent ' ' cases who had been waiting for more than a month . Some 162 , 273 patients had been on the ' ' non-urgent ' ' list for more than one year. // Since it was founded by a Labour government in 1948 , the original structure of the health service has remained largely intact , offering free , comprehensive health care to every citizen funded by taxes and compulsory national health insurance contributions . Despite chronic staff shortages , it is Europe ' s largest single employer , with more than 1 million workers. // And it is the largest single item in the government budget. // The success and popularity of the National Health Service has made it an article of faith among both conservative and liberal politicians . The founder of the service and health minister from 1945-50 , Aneurin Bevan , once said that ' ' no political party would survive that tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thatcher has been unable to include the health service in her free-market revolution . After additional funding last year of some $2 billion , the prime minister has refused any more large increases. // Money vs. management // Because of the national consensus favoring the health service , there has been little discussion of the system itself , except among academics . Political debate has focused instead on issues such as funding , management , and the role of private medical services. // In resisting appeals for more money , the government has taken solace from some economists and consultants who say better management and performance measurements are needed to make the system more accountable. // ' ' We never really raise the question of whether spending more or doing more actually improves the patient ' s health , ' ' says Alan Maynard , professor of health economics at York University . There is a need to measure the outcomes of health care and design a system that gets the maximum benefits from a given budget , he says. // ' ' It may be much better to improve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . health education than to spend more money on health care , ' ' Professor Maynard says . He also observes that Britain spends about 4 percent of its health budget on administration compared with 20 percent in the United States . This amount is not adequate , he says. // David Knowles , general manager of one of Britain ' s largest health districts , agrees . He says the medical profession dominates how the health service is run . ' ' We control it by keeping very tight control on the purse strings and we ration health care with waiting lists , ' ' says Mr. Knowles , who manages the Riverside Health Authority in London. // He also agrees with Maynard on the need to determine outcomes in health care but says this would not necessarily make the manager ' s job any easier nor eliminate public controversy about the health service. // Thatcher has encouraged more private medicine and private medical insurance for those who can afford it . Some 10 percent of the population uses private medical facilities , up from 5 percent a decade ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the health service is shifting , if not breaking up. // ' ' The prime minister thinks there has been a fundamental change in the politics of health in that the people are ready for some kind of change that gives them a better service , ' ' says a senior government official. // But many observers say the system has already been thoroughly studied and public sentiment is strongly on the side of the medical professionals who favor few changes. // ' ' My guess is that the public is with us and not with them , ' ' Dr. Marks says. // //
