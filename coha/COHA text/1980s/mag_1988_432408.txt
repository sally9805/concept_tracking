 | In Salisbury , England , not far from Stonehenge , there is a peculiarly modern scientific enterprise called the Common Cold Unit , where scientists are studying one of humanity 's oldest known afflictions . Using volunteers who cheerfully submit to being infected with virus in return for room and board and a small daily stipend , CCU researchers have been pursuing a cold cure since 1946 . But a visiting American psychologist named Sheldon Cohen is carrying out his own curious agenda there . Aside from the usual blood tests and antibody counts , Cohen employs such novel measures as " social integration " indexes and " stress buffer " and " hassle " scales ? gauging volunteers ' no- tions of how much support they can count on in times of stress ? to see whether such states of mind influence the susceptibilities of the body . Do we catch cold more readily when we are feeling threatened and alone ? That sort of inquiry can still provoke scorn in some scientific quarters . " When you go in and say you want to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a lot of people look at you like you 're crazy . " The public is generally skeptical about such matters , too . People may not be surprised that they blush when they are embarrassed , that a frightening thought can set their hearts racing or a sudden piece of bad news can throw all their systems temporarily out of whack . Yet they find it hard to believe that mental abstractions like " loneliness " or " sadness " can also , somehow , have an impact on their bodies . There are reasons for skepticism , as Cohen himself acknowledges : despite the extravagant claims of New Age psychic healers , solid data connecting good thoughts to good health , or bad ones to falling ill , are still hard to come by . But lately , the doubts have begun to fade . The past 10 years have witnessed an explosion of research findings suggesting that the mind and body act on each other in often remarkable ways . With the help of sophisticated new laboratory tools , investigators are demonstrating that emotional states can translate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ array of organs , glands and cells that comprises the body 's principal mechanism for repelling invaders . Emotional impact : The logical next assumption would be that emotions have an impact on health . That direct linkage ? of state of mind , altered immune response and illness ? is the " hard science " that researchers like Cohen are now tackling . Scores of studies have already found suggestive correlations . Some show higher rates of illness among people who have recently lost a spouse , indicating that bereavement significantly affects their immunity . The same is true of people who feel socially isolated . In one of the largest of these studies , researchers found that for all age and sex groups , mortality was three times higher among those with the fewest close relationships . Having good friends and relatives seemed to afford a measure of protection from stressful life events . Scientists at the University of Michigan reviewed some of the research and agreed that social isolation alone is " a major risk factor " for mortality , perhaps as much as that of cigarette smoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no " control " over their daily lives , breastcancer patients who are pessimistic about recovering and partners locked in strifetorn marriages . The reverse is also true : positive mental states seem to bear favorably on health and longevity . One study headed by psy- chologist Sandra Levy at the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute this year found that a factor called " joy " ? meaning mental resilience and vigor ? was the second strongest predictor of survival time for a group of patients with recurrent breast cancer . ( First was the length of " disease-free intervals . " ) The whole field of mind-body research has been percolating with excitement for a decade . University of Pennsylvania psychologist Martin Seligman , who developed a key concept called learned helplessness , calls the current era " a golden age , " in which long-suspected mind-body interactions are being proved out scientifically . Some practitioners are mining gold from the golden age , purveying healing techniques that 30 years ago would have been dismissed as hokum ? and often still are ( box , page 90 ) . Others are exploiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The public , meanwhile , seems enthralled with the possibilities . At least one recent mind-body tome , " Love , Medicine &; Miracles , " rode The New York Times best-seller list for more than a year , and several others have sold well . The Public Broadcasting Service , also picking up on the current wave of interest , is airing a nine-part series called " The Mind . " Grieving cells : The serious research is getting its biggest push from a hybrid new discipline called psychoneuroimmunology ? PNI , for pronounceability 's sake . PNI is bringing together social scientists and basic scientists , who seldom talked to each other before . " We 're getting fascinating evidence of much stronger links than we ever suspected , " says Ohio State University College of Medicine psychologist Janice Kiecolt-Glaser , who is conducting a long-term study of the effects of stress on caregivers for Alzheimer 's disease patients . " It has opened up vistas that were not even considered a decade ago . " The immune responses researchers have observed are striking . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cells themselves were experiencing grief , or fear , or hope . That notion may not be as fanciful as it seems . In the late 1970s neuroscientist Karen Bulloch , now at the University of California , San Diego , traced direct neurological pathways between the brain and the immune system . Later research indicated that the immune system produces chemicals that feed information back to the brain , much the way the brain 's neurotransmitters signal the immune system . Scientists have since concluded the two are joined in an intricate " feedback loop " by which each influences the other . The implications of this loop are unsettling . To PNI people , the immune system seems to behave almost as if it had a brain of its own . Dr. Candace Pert of the National Institute of Mental Health , a leading reNEWSWEEK : NOVEMBER 7 , 1988 89  | searcher in the field , says that like most people , she once believed " the mind was in the brain , consciousness was in my head . " Now , however , she is convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind and body , and it is sometimes difficult to know who 's in charge . " This , " says Pert , " is creating a revolution in medicine , in the way we view physiology . " More than that , it is raising profound and tantalizing questions about the nature of behavior ? about the essence of what we are . An abiding mystery of the mind-body connection is that it should seem mysterious at all ? an indication , perhaps , of how deeply conditioned we have been by " dualism . " That doctrine , laid down more than three centuries ago by French philosopher Rene Descartes , sees mind and body as distinct entities , to be treated separately . It became the paradigm for modern medicine , and still dominates medical thinking . PNI is trying to bring together what some feel should never have been put asunder . It is still in its infancy as a cross-disciplinary science , but its brief history is marked by some dramatic breakthroughs . In the mid-1970s University of Rochester psychologist Robert Ader , working with immunologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field . The two scientists were conducting a relatively simple taste-aversion study in which they gave rats a saccharine solution to drink , followed immediately by an injection of the nausea-inducing drug cyclophosphamide ? which is also known to suppress immune function . It usually took only one encounter for the animals to connect the taste of saccharin with becoming nauseated , after which the injections of the sickening drug were halted and the association weakened . Several weeks into the study , Ader noticed that the rats that continued to drink the saccharine solution were falling ill . That could have been a result of the immunesuppressing properties of cyclophosphamide , but the animals had received only one small dose of the drug . That led Ader to wonder if , every time the rats tasted the saccharin , their immune systems were affected ? a guess he confirmed by repeated tests with control animals . Somehow , he had managed to condition the rats to suppress their own immune systems , very much in the way that the Soviet psychologist Ivan Pavlov had conditioned dogs to salivate at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this century . Says Ohio State 's Kiecolt-Glaser : " It was a serendipitous finding , and a remarkable one at that . Of course it was absurd to think you could classically condi-  | tion the immune function ? we all knew better than that . " But Ader , as he cheerfully admits , did n't know any better . " I 'm a psychologist , " he says . " I did n't know anything about immunology , including the fact that conditioning could n't happen . " In retrospect , Ader no longer finds his discovery surprising . " It was inconceivable that the two major agencies of defense , the immune and nervous systems , would operate independently with no information about the other . " But at the time the immune system was believed to be the one region of the body that operated independently of the brain . Ader 's discovery punctured that idea , and sped scientists on the quest to find what they now believed must be the " functional pathways " of the immune-brain connection . Natural killers : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivaling the brain in its complexity , as Ader observes , and almost equally difficult to track . Basically , it is a congeries of white cells , or lymphocytes that reside in the thymus gland , spleen , bone marrow and lymph nodes , and monitor the bloodstream . Lymphocytes are the immune system 's frontline warriors . Always on the alert , they produce antibodies that instantly combine with and neutralize any foreign intruders , a kind of " Invasion of the Body Snatchers " in reverse . Sometimes they react too swiftly to harmless antigens , causing the classic allergic reaction . There are other varieties of cells in the immune strike force , including macrophages , which are responsible for healing and repair work , and natural-killer cells ( known as NK 's ) , important in fighting viruses and tumors . NK 's , apparently , are susceptible to emotional factors . In one of her breast-cancer studies , the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute 's Levy found that low NK activity was " significantly associated " with the spread of the cancer . She conclud- NEWSWEEK : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that more than half the fluctuations in NK levels could be accounted for by psychological factors , including perceived social support and the way a patient coped with stress . Why should a natural-killer cell care about how many friends we have , or how well we deal with crises ? The precise mechanisms remain unknown , but some intriguing guesses are beginning to emerge . For one thing , emotional stress often leads us to abuse our body . Grieving over the loss of a loved one , we may gulp pills , sleep badly , eat badly . Feeling helpless , we can , in effect , become more helpless . Pennsylvania 's Seligman developed his learned-helplessness theory by administering mild electrical shocks to rats , some of which could escape the shocks . Those that had no escape route soon became apathetic , so that even when they were provided with an exit , they ignored it . In studies undertaken with colleagues , Seligman confirmed that people who are habitually pessimistic or , in other words , have learned to feel helpless about changing their lives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do less " to prevent future bad events . " Although the behavioral explanation is plausible , it does n't account for those people who get sick even when they report no change in their habits . The alternative explanation that has intrigued researchers is that emotions themselves , and not just what they cause us to do , make a direct impact on our bodies . But how ? For scientists , the anecdotes of mind-over-body cures coming from New Age healers were unconvincing . They needed to chart the process . Who needs a brain ? ' On existing physiological maps , some areas were still blank . The central nervous system , presided over by the brain , branches to every part of the body , and chemicals secreted by the brain affect every function . But while the immune organs are threaded with fibers from the autonomic nervous system ( which controls such " reflexive " functions as breathing and blood flow ) , they seemed free of central brain control . After all , notes Karen Bulloch of UC , San Diego , " when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the thought was , ' Who needs a brain ? ' " It was Bulloch , working as a graduate student in the late 1970s , who managed to trace direct coming-and-going connections between the central nervous system and the immune system , by injecting a dye of horseradish peroxidase into the thymus of a rat , staining the neurons . At around the same time , J. Edwin Blalock , now at the University of Alabama at Birmingham , discovered that cells of the immune system can produce the same type of peptide hormones once believed to be found only in the brain ( where they are known as neuropeptides ) . Blalock recalls the work " met with lots of skepticism and took about four years to replicate . " Eventually , it was shown that immune cells produce virtually any type of hormone the brain produces . The work led Blalock to speculate that the body responds to a whole set of stimuli that are not recognized by the classical senses of taste , touch , smell , hearing and sight . Possibly , the immune system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viruses . If so , the immune system alerts the brain to these foreign @#  | presences , much as the other senses keep the brain in touch with the outside environment . Blalock 's studies suggest that the two systems have certain identical features . " Lymphocytes have receptors for the same neuropeptides as brain cells , " he says , " and have the ability to respond to that hormone " no matter which system it comes from . Chemical messengers : So who is in charge ? Now it appears that the immune system and the brain are continually sending each other messages about their own experiences of the world . Research has shown , for instance , that chronic stress causes the adrenal gland to pump increased amounts of corticosteroids into the bloodstream , and these chemical messengers can inhibit immune action . Much of what we experience as loneliness , grieving or helplessness , in fact , comes down to stress . So experiences of the mind are obviously influencing events in the immune system . On the other hand , Allan Goldstein , a biochemist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies of the thymus gland , discovered that certain immune substances , such as lymphokines , can produce such side effects as depression . That would suggest that the immune system is responsible for at least some things that seem to go on in the head . " It looks as if immune molecules are tied in with the brain , part of the feedback loop , " Goldstein says . The tangle of cross talk does n't stop there . " If these molecules really affect the physiology and metabolism of the brain , " says Goldstein , " is it possible they also influence behavior ? " For that matter , what i behavior ? If chemicals produced by th body can cause depression , " it says emotions are related to molecules that can b bottled . " The mind ? not to say the immune system ? begins to reel , as questions proliferate faster than answers . The only sure conclusion is that we are , in still somewhat mysterious sum , the result of what Goldstein calls " a wonderful system of integrated circuits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jonathan and David . The evidence is now " indisputable , " agrees Sandra Levy . " Every day , every week , there is a new discovery of connections . It certainly destroys any notion Cartesian dualism . " But what these connections ultimately mean for medicine not yet clear . Some researchers hypothesize that the immune system could be conditioned to prevent illness , and even repair wounded tissue . Theodore Melnechuk , a lecturer at UC , San Diego , points increasing evidence that emotions , and even facial expressions , have specific hormonal correlates , and therefore specific effects on tissue . " We are beginning to see parallel story in repair of tissue as in defense against disease , involving the same pathways , " Melnechuk says . " Emotions wound healing . " The NIMH 's Candace Pert is taking that theory a step farther . While studying macrophage cells , Pert and her husband , Mi- chael Ruff , an immunologist , found that the cells ' migrations are influenced by neuropeptides associated with emotions . Peptides , she believes , " may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she is backing up her hunch as scientific director for a venture called Peptide Design , which hopes , one day , to identify specific healing agents . " On some level , people possess within themselves the drug to cure every ill , " she says . " People get freaked out by the idea that , if they are sick , they 've caused it themselves . But they have to realize they have power over their health , because the mind is what heals the body . Literally , your body is the outward manifestation of your mind . " Other scientists are troubled by such assertions , which they feel are too easily distorted by " touchy-feely " entrepreneurs for their own dubious purposes . " There 's a lot of garbage being published , " warns Herbert Spector , a neuroimmunologist with the National Institutes of Health who is sometimes called " the conscience " of the PNI field . Sandra Levy stresses repeatedly that the role of emotional factors is still surrounded by uncertainties . " The major determinant of cancer outcome is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's not a question of mind over matter . All we 're asking is whether behavior or central nervous system factors contribute to the progression of some tumors . If they do , and it 's beginning to look like that 's true , that 's important , because behaviors can change . " Open question : On the other hand , as Levy and others note , whether changed behavior for or emotions can alter immune responses es enough to make a difference in clinical terms is another open question . Because the immune system is so diffuse , there is no single , global measure of its performance . Certain unhappy thoughts or experiences may cause lymphocyte counts to drop , but the change may still leave the person within in healthy parameters ? although it has been pointed out that the 30 to 50 percent to drop in immune response brought about by AIDS has proved deadly to its victims . No one knows what the parameters are . Says Kiecolt-Glaser : " That 's the trouble with the nature of the data . We doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no way of saying how big a drop is harmful or puts you at risk . " For that matter , there is no agreed-upon definition of stress or what its effects are , although " stress management " is one of the staples of the corporate-health-serv-  | ices industry . The abundant stress research done with rats , for instance , is far from conclusive because animals differ physiologically from humans and the stressors used with them are for the most part physical rather than emotional . Sheldon Cohen 's investigation of the relation between stress , immunity and illness at the Common Cold Unit is one of the first attempts to put all three of those factors together in a single study . " It 's very hard to track stress , " Cohen explains . " Arguing backwards from symptoms has a lot of problems . The symptoms themselves can put you under a lot of stress . " KiecoltGlaser 's three-year follow-up of Alzheimer 's caregivers , which she is conducting with her husband , virologist Ronald Glaser , is another study that is apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In an interim report , she notes that earlier studies found failing health in caregivers at the one-year point . Like most of her colleagues , Kiecolt-Glaser is excited about the possibilities of PNI research . Sandra Levy agrees that , potentially , it " could change the whole face of biomedicine in a decade . " Change is coming slowly so far . The dualistic model still dominates medical schools , and the medical establishment as a whole remains cautious on mind-body matters , although many doctors are at least making an effort to include psychosocial factors in the histories they take from patients . PNI is likely to encounter some resistance outside the profession as well . Dualism , after all , reserves a special place for the mind and , by inference , some would argue , the soul . But the bleak and impartial message of PNI research seems to be that the mind is a function of a machinework organism . Such an unpoetic view will sit well neither with religious leaders nor with those who favor a more exalted idea of humanity . Yet even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything it is finding tends to confirm that if people really are machines , they are of a construction more ingenious than even poets dreamed .
