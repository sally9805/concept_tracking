It 's a modest advantage , sure enough , but there 's one category in which the Snow-shoe ski area has got it all over such glittering resorts as Vail and Sun Valley . At Snowshoe , when you get up in the morning you 're already there . That is , you 're already on top of the mountain , in position to ski the first run of the day without waiting in the lift line , which everybody knows is the coldest ordeal ever devised to torment mankind . // Snowshoe just sort of happened this way for no other reason than that the terrain seemed right for it . There it sits in East-Central West Virginia , surrounded by the Monongahela National Forest , in the section of the state that hunches up into the Allegheny Mountains . The resort is promoted as " the island in the sky , " which figures ; it 's perched at 4,750 feet atop Cheat Mountain . Spilling from its doorstep are 10 miles of downhill trails covering 100 or so acres , running on down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may lack in dizzying height , it makes up for in cover  --  most of the trails have snowmaking apparatus . Indeed , when major Eastern ski areas are bone dry , as they were much of the last two seasons , Snowshoe can be up to its thorax in freshly made snow because it 's in a cold pocket . // True , the location takes a little getting used to . West Virginia  --  West Virginia ?  --  does n't exactly leap to mind as any sort of skiing paradise ; mentions of the state are more likely to conjure up thoughts of the stately old Greenbrier and ladies and gentlemen in Lacoste sweaters swinging golf clubs , or of steely-eyed miners . But it is cold  --  afternoons average 15 ? above from December through March , nights from zero to 10 below  --  and as long as the mountain is there , one might as well frost it like a big cake and ski it . // Tramping around the place on crisp autumn days , one begins to see the overall scheme : Snowshoe expects to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the well-to-do in that part of the country . And there seem to be a lot of affluent people around , in spite of the fact that the resort is pretty much in the middle of an economically depressed area . Snowshoe is experiencing a $12 million-a-year construction boom  --  condominiums , townhouses , ski chalets and the like  --  and with this past summer came the final touches : a swimming pool and a weight room . // In thumping for its year-round status , Snowshoe has had something going almost every week , from tennis clinics to horse shows , even a party called the Hillbilly Chili Cookoff a few weekends ago . When you assemble the best of the regional cooks to go head-to-head over pots of chili , it makes for a colorful , aromatic and slightly boozy time . This could never , never happen at the more elegant spas  --  that richly thick , bitingly spicy smell of cooking chili hanging densely in the air while nearby , a bluegrass band named Stompin ' Crick twanged out old hill-country tunes . // While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skiing . The slopes range from gentle to tame , as might be expected on a less-than-lofty mountain , but , surprisingly , there are a couple of runs that qualify as real kidney-busters . A thing called Choker is listed as expert , while Knot Bumper is super-expert  --  not so much for its steepness ( a 25% grade ) , but because it 's a fall-away run that 's been carved into the side of the main ridge . Indeed , just about everything at Snowshoe is a ridge run , trails dropping away from the mountain 's backbone ; not particularly hazardous , but guaranteed to bring you back to the lodge after a day 's skiing with the vague feeling that one of your legs has become shorter than the other . // The final bit of adventure offered by the area is the cold , cold fog , which seems to be an absolute , standard , flat-guaranteed requirement for West Virginia winter mornings . It 's lying there thickly when you awaken , and until the sun burns it off , there 's a definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven Can Wait . This in turn produces line after line of skiers wearing yellow-tinted goggles , another other-worldly effect . // Snowshoe is on its way . And even as you read this , the local hares , abundant in this part of the country , are starting to turn white in anticipation of the winter . Hence the name .
