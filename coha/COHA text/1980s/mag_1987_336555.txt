Who can trust memories ? And why should a memory film  --  this one , say  --  be any more reliable than a dream newsreel ? Flipping through the family album of his imagination , an indulgent author wants to forgive and embrace everyone . So he airbrushes the warts and sets any bedroom closet skeletons to dancing merrily . After all , the kids will be watching . He may also find that his fondness for vignettes ( " Remember when Aunt Bea got squiffed and vamped the delivery boy ? " ) undercuts the dramatic imperative to hold the anonymous viewer 's attention . Private lives do n't always play in public . Grandpa 's % ripping yarn is a stranger 's restless yawn . <P> John Boorman 's family  --  here called the Rohans  --  waged and , from a semidetached house in suburban London , waited out the war against Hitler . Dad ( David Hayman ) joined the army . Mum ( Sarah Miles ) stayed home with the three children . The teenage daughter ( Sammi Davis ) discovered the romance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) held on to any available hand . And Bill ( Sebastian Rice Edwards ) , Boorman 's seven-year-old surrogate , was thrilled to pieces by the explosive newness of it all . A bombed-out house with all its booty ! A Luftwaffe pilot parachuting into the neighborhood ! If these adventures can land on his doorstep , what exploits await him in the wide world outside ? <P> The real boy soon found out . A director-daredevil in the grand British line of Michael Powell and David Lean , Boorman thinks there is still an empire , of traditions if not of global power , worth challenging and defending . Let smaller-souled men paint still lifes of kitchen sinks ; Boorman is a muralist , with epic ambitions and a lust for impossible risks . He has spent his movie career navigating wild rivers ( Deliverance ) or cutting his way through jungles ( The Emerald Forest ) , plunging into the mythic past ( Excalibur ) or the hallucinatory present ( Exorcist II : The Heretic ) . Each film is an exploration of the dark places where civilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And back home , he says , is more of the same  --  the beginning of the same . Everyone in Hope and Glory may be English middle class , but Boorman sees to it that war soon turns the instincts feral . In the rubble of a blitzkrieg , children forage for ghastly souvenirs , and adults renounce a lifetime of propriety for some guilty , convulsive sex . But this is not a horror story , though there are horrors for the Rohans to endure . And though their ordeal was unusual , Boorman makes it close to universal . Every family lives in a war zone of its own circumstances and compromises ; most families find the strength to soldier on . Boorman is even gracious enough to cap his film with an idyllic reunion of clan Rohan . Mum and her sisters giggle conspiratorially ; young Bill , now a gentleman of precious leisure , goes boating on the river . These are images every moviegoer can share as he closes Boorman 's lovely memory book .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
