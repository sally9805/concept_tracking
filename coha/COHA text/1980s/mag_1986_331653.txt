Try not to forget what you saw last week . You say now that it would be impossible to forget : Filipinos armed to the teeth with rosaries and flowers , / massing in front of tanks , and the tanks stopping , and some of the soldiers who were the enemy embracing the people and their flowers . Call that a revolution ? Where were the heads stuck on pikes ? Where were the torches for the estates of the rich ? The rich were in the streets with the poor , a whole country up in flowers . In a short string of remarkable days a crooked election was held and exposed ; a dignified woman established her stature and leadership ; a despot ranted , sweated , fled ; a palace changed guard  --  all with a minimum of blood lust and an abundance of determination and common national will . Not since 18th century France have Americans approved so heartily of a rebellion . <P> Yet the events may slip away quickly , for the same reason they seem so vivid at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played on television , a serial docudrama of easily read scenes and unambiguous images . Network anchormen went on location for the elections . The principals in the story sought news shows as their war grounds . English was spoken there . Exposition was clear , continuity assured . As if to emphasize the context , the major battle was over a television station . Strong characters emerged : Vice President Salvador Laurel ( crafty ) ; General Fidel Ramos ( heroic ) ; the once- and-future Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile ( sophisticated ) ; White House Emissary Senator Paul Laxalt ( resolute ) . Corazon Aquino came across as increasingly impressive as did American diplomacy , in a rare successful role . The villain , as ever , was Marcos , his face a chart of unreason , corruption and bluff . The hard eyes asked always : Is there one more hand to play ? The people : No . Close-up on the shrunken leader , descending a plane , protected by an umbrella . <P> Unforgettable images , so one says ; yet democracy is always more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue , the show from the Philippines will be off the air in a week , and the ecstatic new government will stop dancing and stare coldly at its prosaic problems of too many insurgents and too little money . Then it may still be easy enough to recollect the plot and the cast of the revolution . But will you remember the theme ? <P> The theme is in fact our own : that a people released from oppression will , of their natural inclinations , seek humane values . A revolutionary thought to the likes of Hobbes , who called democracy an aristocracy of orators , but not so wild an idea to Americans , who over the tortuous and often backsliding years * have seen the theme take hold . History in some of its blacker moments has shown that democracy can twist itself into the tyranny of the many , can run to chaos and go mad ; but in the long run , if it is given the long run , it usually turns generous and fair . The Filipinos did not appear to require a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television . Looking ahead , the world wants to see if the country can cast off a history of violence and corruption that long preceded Marcos . For a stunning moment , however , the essential impulse stood up for all to marvel at . There before your eyes a thought became a decision became a deed , with no other impetus than that a people realized they had a claim on their own souls .
