When the shooting started , gold and oil prices rose and stocks slumped <P> Ever since the oil embargo of 1973 , Western economies have had to live with the fear that precious crude from the Middle East would once again be cut off . Last week , as the war between Iran and Iraq threatened to make that bad dream a reality , financial centers from New York to Tokyo immediately trembled . But the markets then responded with surprising strength and absence of panic . Said one Manhattan stockbroker at midweek : " The market seems to be taking this as if nothing were happening . It seemed that the latest Middle East war was one the Western oil-consuming world could still afford , at least for the moment . " <P> The relative steadiness in financial markets was based on a widespread belief that the fighting in the Persian Gulf would be of limited duration and would not seriously interrupt or reduce the petroleum flow . The world currently has a comfortable 2 million to 3 million bbl. per day oil-production surplus , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss of crude exported by Iran and Iraq . <P> Nonetheless some oil experts warned that the 100-day supply of crude around the world could quickly evaporate . Two years ago , there was also an international oil glut , but that was quickly gone after the upheavals in Iran resulted in lower production in that country . Much of the so-called glut is oil needed to fill the complex transportation and refining network , and a decline of as little as 7% could touch off emergencies . <P> Data Resources , the Lexington , Mass. - based econometric forecasting firm , estimated last week that an extended shutdown of the 4.9 million bbl. per day production in Iran and Iraq could cause a rise in world oil prices of 50% above its original projections by the end of 1981 . Since petroleum prices are extremely sensitive to any long-term reduction in world oil supplies , a shortfall in Iranian and Iraqi crude could hike the contract cost of a barrel of oil from its current $32 to about $57 . <P> Gold , the international barometer of world economic anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just two days , the yellow metal 's price shot up to $720 per oz. in London , an increase of $46 . Later in the week , however , the price slipped back to around $700 per oz . Those levels are still well below the alltime high of $875 , which was reached in January after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . Gold shares on the Johannesburg stock exchange in South Africa , where most of the Western world 's gold is mined , were heavily traded . Reported one broker : " The Americans are grabbing everything they can get . " Frightened Arab bullionaires are now asking for physical possession of their precious metal rather than leaving it in Swiss or other bank vaults . Reason : after the American seizure of Iranian financial assets in June , wealthy Arabs became leery about leaving their property in any Western banks . Since August , more than 150 tons of gold have been repatriated from European banks to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia .                @ @ @ @ @
