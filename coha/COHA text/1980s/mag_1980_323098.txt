Clinching a cleanup treaty <P> In Naples 19 people die in a cholera epidemic caused by eating contaminated mussels . In Istanbul fishermen complain that their catch diminishes with every voyage . In Spain an outbreak of typhoid fever in a coastal town sends 20 people to the hospital . And along France 's famous Cte d'Azur black pollution flags and even police lines keep bathers off beaches . <P> Over the past decade , the alarms have sounded with ever greater frequency and urgency . Pollution in the celebrated body of water that was the cradle of Western civilization endangered those who make their home or living along its shores . Outbreaks of dysentery , viral hepatitis and typhoid have become common in some areas . Scientists in the know joke that to order oysters in a restaurant in Rome or Naples is to play " Italian roulette . " And it is all happening in the world 's most popular vacation playground : the Mediterranean , host to 100 million tourists a year . <P> The Mediterranean is a closed sea , its only significant outlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewage that pours into its waters is untreated . The Naples sewer system is so antiquated that authorities can not even locate the pipes . In Athens , 60% of the city is not connected to the central sewage system . Pollution is most severe along the French and Italian Rivieras , where the chemical wastes of thousands of factories are flushed directly into the sea or carried there by major rivers . The chances of getting all 18 countries that border the Mediterranean to agree on methods of controlling pollution seemed remote . But five years ago , the United Nations Environment Program ( UNEP ) decided to try . Last week at a conference in Athens that climaxed a remarkable feat of scientific diplomacy , the U.N . team won the approval of all but one of the Mediterranean nations ( xenophobic Albania ) for a treaty outlining ways to clean up the sea . <P> The environmentalists had to overcome the mutual mistrust of such traditional antagonists as Israel and Syria , Greece and Turkey . Shrewdly , the U.N . team put off seeking consensus on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It designed and helped fund a regional pollution monitoring system that included 84 laboratories to document conditions in the waters . The labs turned up some hopeful signs : the absorption capacity of the Mediterranean proved to be greater than many experts had imagined , and pollution levels were not uniformly critical . Concluded Stjepan Keckes , the Yugoslav marine scientist who headed the U.N . team : " The Mediterranean is sick , but it is not dead and it is not even dying . " <P> Some regions , like Greece 's Saronic Gulf and the northern part of the Adriatic , were found to be hazardous , but others turned out to be relatively pure . The biggest polluters , not surprisingly , are France , Italy and Spain . Thus they will have to bear the biggest part of the cost of the more than $10 billion program . The proposed treaty includes a blacklist of banned substances ( for example , mercury , cadmium , radioactive materials ) and a gray list of those that will be tolerated in specified quantities . All factories and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and new installations will have to conform to treaty specifications .
