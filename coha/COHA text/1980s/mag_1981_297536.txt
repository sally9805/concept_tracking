Tough talk at the U.N . <P> <P> When foreign ministers and United Nations ambassadors from 93 Third World delegations concluded a meeting at U.N . headquarters in New York on Sept. 28 by issuing a one-sided anti-American communique , few delegates took much notice . After all , the 21-page declaration had been designed and pushed through by Cuban Foreign Minister Isidoro Malmierca Peoli , hardly an admirer of the U.S. , and it repeated the standard litany of Third World gripes about American power . But the reaction of American U.N . Ambassador Jeane J. Kirkpatrick was anything but routine . <P> Kirkpatrick wrote to leaders of a number of Third World delegations regarded as moderately friendly to the U.S. <P> She demanded to know how the delegates could have supported " base lies and malicious attacks upon the good name of the United States . " Such views , she said , are not " an accurate reflection of your government 's outlook . And yet , what are we to think when your government joins in such charges , for that is what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kirkpatrick was merely taking the same hard line against anti-Americanism among nonaligned countries laid down by former U.N . Ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan , yet diplomats at the U.N . were atwitter , grumbling that the letter was unmatched in its undiplomatic tone . <P> The letter is very much in keeping with Kirkpatrick 's style at the U.N . Although friends say she is shy and a bit uncomfortable with the social aspects of her job , many of her colleagues consider her " schoolmarmish " and " uppity , " as one put it . <P> Friends and foes alike consider Kirkpatrick 's staff inexperienced and inept . In the past , members of the U.S. mission would keep abreast of a nonaligned meeting , quietly emphasize Washington 's interests and encourage friendly delegations to exercise restraint . This time , no one from the U.S. <P> was around to monitor the proceedings . <P> One angry recipient of the Kirkpatrick letter sniffed that she was like " the absent parent who scolds her child for misbehavior committed in her absence . " <P> Officials at the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter in advance . Still , as one senior official at State said , " it reflects thinking at the top . " Added a White House aide very much at the top : " We do n't feel like just sitting there and letting them spit in our faces . "
