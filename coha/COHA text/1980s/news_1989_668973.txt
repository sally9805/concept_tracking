They stand at vastly different vantage points in their political careers , but the three aldermen serving Portage Park and Irving Park have similar views of their communities . The common thread of concern is preservation of the quality of life in these residential and relatively quiet city neighborhoods . For Ald. Joseph Kotlarz ( 35th ) , this means " the delivering of the best possible city services on a daily basis . " For Ald. Thomas Cullerton ( 38th ) , " protecting the residential nature of the whole community " is of primary importance . Ald. Patrick Levar ( 45th ) says that although the residents are the main concern , a thriving business atmosphere is equally important . While the three do not always agree on issues , they say they listen to each other and work together on projects of common interest . At 32 , Kotlarz is a youngster in the world of politics , but his six years as alderman have nurtured an obvious relish for the position . " I ' d like to be an alderman the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have been made over the last few years . New curbs and sidewalks line The Villa , a city-designated historic district in Irving Park . Elsewhere , a neglected factory has been bought and rehabbed for use as an office building . The transformation resulted from residents ' complaints , which led to a court procedure and subsequent sale of the property , he says . " I ' m not going to let someone stew over a problem in their life if I can do something about it , " Kotlarz says . He states his philosophy as one of " opening up government , " which he says helped him get elected fresh out of law school in a conservative ward containing many senior citizens . Because of the elderly and others on fixed incomes , a main need for the community is lower taxation , he says . " The tax base has risen too high too quickly , " he says . " The city needs to look at alternate measures quickly . " Kotlarz , who is single , was born in an area just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area from Fullerton Avenue on the south to Montrose Avenue on the north , between Kedzie Avenue on the east and the Chicago &; North Western tracks to the west . The ward encompasses about two-thirds of Irving Park . He also serves as Democratic ward committeeman and is the chairman of the Claims and Liabilities Committee in the City Council . While he maintains a law practice , Kotlarz says his time is largely consumed by his aldermanic duties . The annual salary for the full-time elected position is $40 , 000 . " You really have to work through the community structure , " he says , adding that he works with neighborhood groups and attends their meetings regularly . Kate Ficke , chairman of the board of the Northwest Neighborhoods Federation , a coalition of eight neighborhood organizations that pool their efforts in solving community problems , says Kotlarz and Cullerton have been attending the organization ' s meetings for years . " They really want to find out the pulse of the people , and I think they feel we are a good measure of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very helpful with the concerns we have as a neighborhood organization . " With Ald. William J.P. Banks ( 36th ) , Cullerton and Kotlarz in 1986 introduced in the City Council an ordinance to provide citywide home equity insurance should property values decline . The federation did initial research for the proposal . The ordinance was approved by the council but vetoed by Mayor Eugene Sawyer . The state legislature last year passed a similar law allowing home equity insurance in Chicago precincts that voted for it in a referendum . In November , all precincts in Portage Park and Irving Park voted for the insurance . Cullerton says he is particularly proud of his work on the proposal , as he feels it is important to the large number of homeowners in his ward . Boundaries of the 38th Ward are Laramie Avenue on the east , Pacific Avenue on the west , generally Addison Street or Belmont Avenue on the south , and Lawrence or Montrose Avenues generally on the north . The ward encompasses about three-fourths of the Portage Park neighborhood . Elected in 1973 , Cullerton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late William Cullerton , served as alderman of the 38th Ward before him , and another relative held the post before that . The 63-year-old electrician boasts that not only he and his wife , Betty , but also his 4 children and 10 grandchildren all live in the ward . He says his greatest accomplishment over the years has been protecting the special residential nature of the neighborhood . Despite diverse ethnic groups , including Polish , Italian , German , Irish and Scandinavian , the desires and needs within the ward are mostly compatible , Cullerton says . The alderman , who also serves as Democratic ward committeeman , chairman of the council ' s Aviation Committee and vice chairman of the Zoning Committee , says a crucial part of the job is determining true majority opinion of the community on issues . He says he calls meetings for all the residents within a few blocks of a site under consideration for a zoning change , but even then it can be tricky . " That ' s the hardest part in this job , to decide if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cullerton says . " Sometimes a minority can be very vocal . " Cullerton says he plans to stay in office as long as possible , standing by his simple political philosophy of " government for the people . " Standing at the other end of the spectrum of aldermanic experience is Patrick Levar , elected in the 45th Ward in 1987 . Born in the area , Levar , 38 , got his start in politics as a Democratic precinct captain when he was a teenager . He was assistant to the Cook County Circuit Court Clerk for 14 years before he ran for alderman on the slogan : " From the neighborhood , for the neighborhood . " He has made a swift and favorable impression on local leaders , say officials of the Portage Park Chamber of Commerce . Jeannine Smentek , executive director of the chamber , says Levar has shown an interest in the business community . " While he is new , he has been coming to the meetings , and we feel he is very concerned with development in the community , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to " hire someone from the neighborhood . " Both he and Cullerton are proud of the thriving atmosphere in Portage Park , having worked to create new strip shopping centers and commercial space in the neighborhood , such as a strip shopping center and office complex at Ainslie Street and Milwaukee Avenue in Levar ' s ward . The 45th Ward , which Levar likes to call a suburb in the city , roughly covers the area from Harlem Avenue on the west to Pulaski Road on the east and between Montrose and Foster Avenues on the south and north . Levar has created an advisory council of community leaders to keep him aware of residents ' needs and concerns . Both Levar and Kotlarz continue fighting proposals by the Illinois Department of Transportation and the city ' s Department of Public works to close several ramps and bridges connecting the communities to the Kennedy Expressway . So far , they have been partially successful . The Wilson Avenue bridge at Cicero Avenue has been spared , but the Hamlin Street bridge will be closed . The fight now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reroute traffic at the intersection of Keeler Avenue and Irving Park Road . " I don ' t think we should inconvenience our constituents with the closures , " Levar says . " Every second counts for a fire ; every second counts for an ambulance . " Sandy Longton , president of the Mayfair Civic Association , a community organization that includes part of Portage Park , and chairman of the Coalition to Save the Ramps and Bridges , says all three aldermen have been concerned and cooperative on the issue . " You can just see how grateful the people who attend these meetings are that we finally have someone in office who cares , " Longton says . " We are very lucky . They do have a lot of influence with people , and I think the constituents are going to remember them for the work they are doing . " Levar , who is married and has four children , says the job of alderman is a " dream come true , " and he hopes to continue for several more years . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ' s a great place to raise a family . People are proud of it , and I want to help make it even better. "
