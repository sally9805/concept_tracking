This story has been entered on the data base in 2 parts . This is part 1 . On a bright March afternoon , Scott Craig is at work in a studio within the maze at WBBM-TV on McClurg Court , poring over videotape for his latest documentary . Laurie Rackas , Craig ' s associate and writer , and an old colleague , a semi-retired editor named Bud Marcus , are winding down six months of work on " Women of the War . " Six months of phone calls and interviews and research are finished ; six months of shooting on locations around the Midwest are wrapped . In a few days , Craig and Rackas will meet Channel 2 anchorman Bill Kurtis in Washington , D.C. , at the Vietnam Veterans ' Memorial to apply the finishing touches to the hour . " Women of the War " ( which aired last month on Channel 2 ) was designed as a melancholy look at seven Midwestern women whose lives were touched by the Vietnam War . The idea came from a friend inside the station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit to the Wall-the Vietnam memorial . " When I looked at those names on the Wall , " he said , " I understood that every one of them had to be multiplied by two or four or six . Those are the stories that haven ' t been told . " On this afternoon , Craig and company are talking about cutaways , about music , about what to take and what to leave behind in the 49-minute hour television gives them . And Craig , who will determine every second of what finally appears , is thinking about the story he wishes to tell . On the screen , a black woman named Rebecca Bibbs is talking about her son , Wayne , a son who disappeared inside Vietnam 16 years ago in the fiery crash of a helicopter . " You know , " Craig says , gazing at the monitor , " when she thinks of him , when she dreams about him coming home , she thinks of a 17-year-old boy he was , not the 34-year-old man he ' d be right now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that music may be too sad . " " No , " says Craig , staring hard at his craft . " No , this is a sad story . " Scott Craig makes television . He makes it meticulously , always with an eye for story telling . He makes it slowly , at a pace more often associated with novelists than with the cut-and-paste operatives of " Broadcast News . " In more than 20 years as a producer and director of documentaries and the occasional entertainment special , Craig has been able to make television the way he likes it . That in itself is no mean accomplishment . He has labored for two of Chicago ' s network-owned TV stations , for Public Broadcasting and Turner Broadcasting and the University of Chicago . For much of that time , he has maintained his own production company on a nondescript corner of West Willow , near Halsted . Craig has been lionized and ignored , hailed as an artist and dismissed as a dinosaur . Through it all , he has continued making documentaries , dozens of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ films for groups as diverse as McDonald ' s and the state of Michigan . The walls of Craig ' s North Side home are lined with pictures of his daughters , Jennifer and Amy , and studded with a collection of plaques and trophies . There are local and national Emmys , a trio of Alfred Dupont-Columbia University awards , citations from film festivals in Chicago , New York and San Francisco , and a George Foster Peabody award for excellence in documentry filmmaking . It ' s the tangible evidence of a lifetime spent telling stories as eclectic as the travails of the modern Catholic priesthood , Oscar Brown Jr . , Chicago ' s " Fighting 47th " ward , the crisis in public education , the Continental Bank disaster , the investigative techniques of TV journalism and baseball ' s " Shoeless " Joe Jackson and the 1919 " Black Sox " gambling scandal . " We wrote two endings for that one , which was a fictional courtroom drama , " said Craig , smiling . " And we gave people a phone number at Channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big . " Craig , 53 , grew up in Wooster , Ohio , and attended Wooster College , where his father was head of the speech department and directed campus stage productions . All of Craig ' s instincts led him to believe he would follow his father into the theater . " I remember as a kid standing in the back of the theater with my father , watching his shows , " he said . " It ' s funny , because what he loved was the way in which a stage production was a little different every night . As it turned out , I was quite different . I enjoy mapping everything out , putting it in place , always knowing just what ' s coming next . " After Wooster College , Craig moved on to graduate school at the University of Illinois . Drama was still his principal interest , and to this day there is a bit of the actor , a bit of a strut in Craig ' s temperament and demeanor . " I never took a film class or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalism class , for that matter . My interest was entirely in the theater . It wasn ' t until I got to Illinois that I happened upon TV . And that was because I needed a part-time job . " In Champaign , Craig got a job as an on-air performer at WICA-TV , the CBS affiliate . " In those days , " he said , " Edward R. Murrow and the ' CBS Reports ' folks were our heroes . In the early ' 60s , we watched Murrow ' s ' Harvest of Shame , ' and I discovered some of the old Depression documentaries by Pare Lorentz , stuff like ' The Plow That Broke the Plains , ' films made for the WPA . " While at WICA , Craig and his fledgling associates found themselves with roughly 40 half-hours of programming with which to experiment . All of the shows made it onto the air ; Craig says he can still sit through two or three of them without wincing . " It was an amazing TV experience , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs and the pressures , there ' s simply no place in TV nowadays for that sort of freedom to experiment and produce and learn . " Craig came to Chicago in 1963 , working as a producer at Channel 2 . Finding his newly crafted documentary skills a valued commodity in a competitive TV market , he ankled over to WMAQ-TV ( Channel 5 ) in 1965 . " I went to Channel 5 for a decade , " he said , " and the joke around the station early on was to call the place ' Camelot . ' TV people talk that way when they ' re happy . We had huge ratings with ( anchorman ) Floyd Kalber , I learned a lot , and I worked for a delightful man named Bob Lemon . " Over time , I watched them just annihilate ( then-general manager ) Lemon . The place changed , Lemon moved on , and I didn ' t want to be there . And I decided , around 1972 or so , that based on that experience , I didn ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any TV executive . I had to form my own company . " I ' ve had good relationships with station management since , including right now with ( Ch. 2 general manager ) Johnathan Rodgers . But I never regretted that decision . I ' m still leery of the sharp-pencil three tiers up , the guy who can change everything . " Craig started his production company in 1975 , the same year he returned to WBBM as an executive producer . And , given his idiosyncratic bent , his first effort at his old stand was not a news documentary , but a piece on musician Oscar Brown Jr . Since returning to WBBM , Craig has split time with the station , generally devoting about half his energy to station projects like " Women of the War , " the rest to his own endeavors . In the studio on Willow , Craig and Kathy Giangreco , his associate producer , writer and reporter for the last seven years , are involved in an ambitious , privately funded project to explore America ' s inland waterways and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete in about a month ; research for the series itself will consume the rest of this year and part of the next . Then come the lawyers and the search for a buyer , for a broadcast operation to air the series . Giangreco is spending much of the spring on the lower Mississippi River , looking for stories . Craig will be elsewhere on the Mississippi , on a similar assignment . " It ' s a huge project for us , " said Giangreco , " but the approach will be much the same as always . We look for good stories , we report them , we do the interviews , then we get back together in Chicago and sort them out in terms of the larger story we want to tell . " Anyone who works for Scott gets familiar with what we call Craig ' s Laws . One of them is , ' We don ' t do travelogues . ' When we do a piece about a place , we tell a story .
