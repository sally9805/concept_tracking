Now comes Miguel Rivera who , standing alone , represents all the reasons people escape the city . Rivera , of fleeting address and faster feet , has taken more material out of homes and apartments around the Uphams Corner area than a mover . Rivera the robber performs in daylight . The street is his office . His specialty : House calls . Everybody knows him : homeowners , apartment dwellers , storekeepers and , especially , the police who shot him last year during a robbery attempt . But to know Rivera is not necessarily to catch him . " It ' s amazing , " Diane Roberts was saying . " Nobody can catch him . It ' s absolutely unbelievable . Is he that much better than the whole Boston Police Department ? " Diane Roberts has been victimized by Rivera the robber at least twice . The first time he took jewlery , coins and " everything that ever meant anything to me . " A few days later he came back to her home . On the second visit he took several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you figure that ? " Diane Roberts asks . " The first time he robbed me was a couple weeks ago during the day , " she was saying . " Then last week I had to go to the hospital . " I had come home early from work and left the house at three . The neighbor across the street saw Rivera standing on my front porch with three big trash bags in his hand and a pillowcase . " The neighbor chased him in his cab , he drives a cab for a living , but lost him . When I got home I called the cops but no cops showed up so I called back and they wanted to take the report over the phone . " Robbery is way down the list of priorities now . But I insisted they come to the house so about two and a half hours later two detectives showed up to take a report . " On Monday he came back to my house but a woman saw him and chased him away . So he went across the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who live on the third floor saw him and scared him off . They don ' t speak English so they had to wait until someone else came home to call the cops . " There are at least two arrest warrants out for Rivera the robber . Both of them issued after homes around Uphams Corner were robbed . More warrants are expected today . " Oh yeah , " Diane Roberts said . " Absolutely . At least two because Thursday afternoon he came back to the house across the street and broke in . " Friday he broke in on the second floor at that house . He had hit the first floor on Thursday , snapped all the locks . " At least three people saw Rivera the robber early Thursday evening outside Ruggiero ' s Sub shop on Stoughton street . He had a sub sandwich in one hand and a TV set in the other . He was eating the sub , thought to be made of tunafish . He was trying to sell the TV , thought to be a Sony . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He robbed the house at number 5 Alvan terrace . Then on the 31st he got mine for the first time . " A few days later he made another attempt at mine . Then there was number 9 Alvan terrace . " The same day he robbed a house down at the corner of Annapolis street . Thursday he was back at number 9 . Friday he came back again to number 9 for the second floor . " And he ' s starting to steal some really strange things . I told you about just taking the Atari cassettes ; well , he took all the clothes out of the guy ' s house at number 5 . I mean all of them , everything except what the guy had on his back . " Across the street , the woman has a really nice stereo set . Well Rivera only took the speakers . He left the stereo . I guess he can leave thingsbecause he knows he can come back for them anytime he wants and nobody will catch him . " " How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I ' ve picked him out of the mug shots , " Diane Roberts said . " My neighbor picked him out Friday night . Another neighbor ' s going over to District C Monday night . She ' ll pick him out . " The cabdriver across the street knows it ' s him . The people around Uphams Corner all know it ' s him . Everybody knows it ' shim . Even the cops who can ' t catch him . He even wears my daughter ' s legwarmer on his head for a hat . Of course , he stole it . " But it ' s not funny . My kids get hysterical now whenever someone comes to the front door . I ' ve got four locks on the door . I leave the dogs in . I ' ve got a peephole in the door . You go to work and work hard . And for what ? To have someone steal everything you ' ve worked for ? " The cops tell us what the guy needs is a good beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rivera ' s created a whole village of fear around here . Living ' s hard enough without something like this going on . And if they say robbery ' s low on the priority list what they ' re really saying is , so are neighborhoods. "
