MEN OF THE WORLD make mistakes . Sometimes they go to jail , and sometimes they get shunned by their golf part-ners at the country club . The Fruehauf Corporation , in its 1979 " Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders . " pub-lished a list of twenty-eight American executives who , during the period 1971-1978 , had been indicted for or implicated in some sort of crime . Corporate crime does not shock anyone these days , so what is most surprising about Fruehauf 's list is not its contents , but rather the circumstances under which it was compiled . annotated , and published . Exactly what led Fruehauf truck manufacturer with $2 billion in annual sales , No. 131 on the Fortune 500 list , and servant of America ) to publish this list of offenders is a fable that begins four years ago in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan , Southern Division . On June 30 , 1975 , Judge Thomas Thornton found that by using deceptive invoices and a fake wholesale price structure . the Fruehauf Corporation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its Chairman of the Board , William E. Grace . were guilty as charged in a 1970 indictment of conspiracy to evade more then $12.3 million in corporate federal excise taxes . Evading taxes is an American sport , so Rowan and Grace did n't mount a defense or testify on their own behalf . One supposes that Rowan and Grace expected nobody to believe they could have broken the law or that they should be held personally to account . To Charles J. Miller , the chief government prosecutor , however , this case was a landmark ? the " first time the government has prosecuted and obtained a criminal conviction of a major corporation and its officers in a tax case . " Miller " hoped desperately " that Judge Thornton would impose jail sentences on Rowan and Grace . The punishment , he thought , would have " deterrent value . " One year later , during the same week Richard Nixon was being disbarred in New York , Miller 's hope was realized . Rowan and Grace were fined $10,000 and both were sentenced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time a pillar of his community : member of the Detroit Athletic Club , former president of the Oakland Hills Country Club , self-made millionaire . A tall , florid fellow who looks quite a lot like former U.S. Attorney General John Mitchell , he had spent twenty years at Fruehauf . Not the criminal type at all , really . Co-conspirator Grace 's life had been pure Horatio Alger ? the man who never attended college yet ends up a mogul given to such aphorisms as " Stick and stay and make it pay . " This is the sort of man you expect to find on national political tickets . In fact , there were echoes of Nixon in Rowan 's protestations of innocence , " As a crook , " Rowan said , " you have to steal . and I do n't think anyone accused Grace and I sic of stealing anything . The worst that can be said is that we worked too hard for Fruehauf and its stockholders . " Actually , the worst that can be said is that they 're felons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Rowan 's defense when he described the difference between a tycoon and a company-made manager . " The former was the parent of the giant corporation , " Baran wrote , " the latter is its child . To one the corporation was merely a means to enrichment ; to the other the good of the company has become both an economic and ethical end . The one stole from the company ; the other steals for it . " ROBERT ROWAN was firm in his belief that he had not stolen anything from the government for his company . Surely , he said , there 's been a mistake . He pleaded his innocence . He appealed . First he appealed , along with his co-defendants . Grace and Fruehauf , to the U.S. Circuit Court . ( Meanwhile he kept his job , drawing a salary in the neighborhood of $500,000 . A valued employee , he knew more about running the company than anyone else . ) The appeals court turned him down . Twice . But corporate executives can be persistent , and . with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the U.S. Supreme Court . As thou-h Fruehauf did n't have enough problems , a shareholder named Edward Nathan , not a relative of mine . Robert Stuart Nathan , a former White House correspondent for National Public Radio 's " All Things Considered , " is the author of Amusement Park , a novel ( Dial ) . His new novel , Rising Higher , will be published in the spring . filed suit to force Fruehauf to recover legal fees from Rowan and Grace . The board of directors , in the name of the company . decided to fight Nathan . The board members also passed resolutions indemnifying themselves against legal expenses to fight him . Finally , the board said that recovering legal fees from Rowan and Grace was impossible because all the fees ? Rowan 's , Grace 's , and the company 's ? were commingled and they could n't just divide by three . For the future , the board presented the stockholders with a proposal to amend the corporate bylaws to indemnify everybody against any future legal expenses in any kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , but a year ago , more than three years after the original trial and eight years since the original indictment , their appeals ran out . Robert D. Rowan , William E. Grace , and the Fruehauf Corporation lost . Mario Puzo would have some insight into what happened next . Puzo 's Don Vito Corleone governed his " family " , with a credo that could be stated as " I take care of my own . " When one of the Don 's employees was arrested " and by some mischance sent to prison , that unfortunate man 's family received a living allowance ; and not a miserly , beggarly , begrudging pittance , but the same amount the man earned when he was free . " This is called , by mobsters and the rest of us , helping your friends when they 're down . Rowan and Grace were down , and friends came to the rescue . The Fruehauf board accepted the men 's resignations and granted them " leaves of absence . " The board also amended the company 's bylaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board of directors , so as to save their seats at the table . And to ease Rowan through difficult times , they hired him as a $100-an-hour consultant . In the final six weeks of 1978 , following Rowan 's resignation . Fruehauf paid him $16,500 in consulting fees , or just under $3,000 a week . That was not really a princely sum ? before his conviction he was earning almost $10,000 a week . Even luckier for Grace and Rowan , and to the distress of federal prosecutors , Judge Thomas Thornton had a change of heart . At the recommendation of defense attorneys , he suspended their jail sentences , ordered them to do full-time " community service , " and placed them on supervised probation . As community service , Rowan helped an alcoholic rehabilitation center get its books in order . William E. Grace worked with teenagers on an 88-acre Texas cattle ranch owned by the W. E. " Bill " Grace Foundation . " We thought we would volunteer to do community service , " Rowan said , " rather than spend our time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who supervised Rowan at the Sacred Heart Rehabilitation Center , supported this view . " A lot of people say he got off very easy . Sheesh ! How long has the guy lived with this case hanging over his head ? I certainly do n't think he got off scot-free . Society put a lot of pressure on him . " Father Quinn , himself a former alcoholic , probably knows a thing or two about social pressure , and in any event Rowan set out to raise $100,000 for Sacred Heart . The work proved to be something less than harsh penance . Fortune magazine approvingly reported that Rowan 's former Fruehauf secretary typed many of his fund-raising letters , that Rowan still drove to work in his company-supplied Continental Mark V , and that fund-raising sessions were held on the Fruehauf yacht . Fortune , agreeing with Father Quinn , said that " no one should think that Grace and Rowan got off easy . Conviction on felony charges marks out a considerable stain upon their personal records . " I AST MAY , five months after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the board table had been cold long enough . It wanted the two men back . Who promoted this decision , and how Rowan and Grace felt about it , is hard to tell . Linda deRuiter , the corporation 's public-relations manager , at first told me that Fruehauf had nothing to hide and that everybody would be glad to talk about the company 's troubles . But in the end no one was available . " I do n't mean to be stalling you on this , " said Miss deRuiter . In order to return ex-cons Grace and Rowan to their old jobs , the Fruehauf board had to cope with the public . The directors wanted to recommend . in the " Annual Notice of Meeting of Shareholders , " that the stockholders vote these two loyal company men back onto the board , but to do it decorously . So they called a lawyer . They hired an accountant . They requested a thorough investigation of the excise-tax case . The board clearly needed a blue-chip recommendation that the best way to rehabilitate Grace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alas , the rehabilitation plan ran into a snag . The outside lawyers and accountants were willing to recommend rehiring Grace and Rowan , but not unreservedly . In their report to the board the outside advisers said , " In reaching its decision with respect to the future employment of these individuals , the Board must accept the fact that Grace and Rowan are guilty of the crime for which they were convicted . " Translation : They 're convicted felons , gentlemen . You ca n't escape that . " From the inception of the program ... in the preparation of federal excise tax reports , " the outside advisers said , " Rowan and the company tax depart . ment sought legal and accounting advice .... It developed , however , that they did not adhere strictly to the advice proffered , and , moreover , the courts concluded that they misrepresented the facts to their outside advisers . " " The rehiring of executives convicted of a crime , " the outside advisers said , " will he regarded by many as unsound corporate policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reaction . The directors felt obligated to pass this outside advisers ' report on to the stockholders . But , as George Orwell once said , if thought corrupts language , language can also corrupt thought . The hoard gave the report its own interpretation . Ignoring the advice of lawyers and misrepresenting facts became " serious errors of judgment . " As for being indicted and convicted , " We believe they acted at all times in what they perceived to he the best interests of the company . " And as for the public-relations problem , it was manageable . " We recognize that in the light of present-day principles of morality , it is likely that a decision to reinstate Grace and Rowan will be viewed by some people as evidence of insensitivity to moral issues . " One of those " some people " was a Fruehauf stockholder from Grosse Pointe . " What we 're saying , " Hope Brophy said at Fruehauf 's annual meeting , " is that the American business system is rewarding criminal behavior . I think we really are engaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nonsense , Mrs. Brophy ! " We believe , " the board said , " that equally valid principles of morality require the Board to seek the preservation of the best interests of the Company . " And so the board substituted equally valid moral principles for present-day moral principles and hoped no one would notice the switch . HE BOARD appended to its annual meeting notice " Exhibit C to Exhibit 1 Hereof , " en- titled " Corporate Analogies : 1971-1978 . " Exhibit C is the aforementioned list of twenty-eight executives implicated in or indicted for some sort of corporate crime . ( I have added the names of the individuals involved and amended several items in order to update the list . ) In fifteen of the twenty-eight examples of Exhibit C. the corporate officer was able , by hook or crook , to stay with the company . Fruehauf 's legal advisers saw in Exhibit C a direct and expedient lesson in the rehabilitation of criminals : " It appears from that list that the number of times such officials were retained or reinstated is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while there is currently an increasing trend toward strict adherence to principles of public morality , it can not yet be said that it must always override other considerations . " Tarring twenty-five companies with Fruehauf 's brush was , of course . a dirty trick on Fruehauf 's part , for the list the company published included with the guilty a number of corporate innocents ? companies that had acted with dispatch to terminate the employment of besmirched officers . But the net effect of the list is to make Fruehauf seem to vanish in a crowd . It also serves , disingenuously , a social theory that is Fruehauf 's very own : To reform a criminal , send him back to do what he was doing before he was convicted . This should also work with bank robbers and muggers . For the record : Fruehauf 's shareholders overwhelmingly reelected Robert Rowan and William Grace to the board of directors . and Mr. Rowan is running the company once again .                  @ @ @
