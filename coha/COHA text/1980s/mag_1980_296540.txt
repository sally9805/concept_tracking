The barber would unlock the door of his shop at 7 a.m. or so-early , because it was an important ceremony of his day to shave the important and self-important men of the town , whose gold-lettered mugs stood splendidly on the shelf above the mirror . Then he would hang up his straw hat and suit coat and raise his window shades . After that he would put on his barber coat , and , finally , he would step outside his shop with the key for winding up his spring-driven barber pole motor . When the twisted red , white and blue stripes began spiraling their way to infinity ( a kid could watch those stripes coming down from the top of the pole and disappearing into the bottom of the pole for a good stretch of time without figuring out where they went ) , you knew the barber was open for business . <P> But those spring-wound models are old stuff , and William Marvy , who operates the last barber-pole factory in the U.S. , is not impressed . When one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for repairs , he sends it back electrified . Marvy , 70 , has been in the business for 55 years , and he has been up to date every step of the way . This up-to-dateness is itself a kind of spring-wound relic : the breezy , bet-on-the-future confidence of a Midwestern traveling salesman from a half-century ago . <P> Marvy is a substantial , pink-faced man with a sandy mustache and a booming voice . He has three Dutch Masters cigars and a ballpoint pen in the breastpocket of his suit . But it is n't hard to change the ballpoint to a fountain pen , erase a few facial lines and see him as a 25-year-old self-employed salesman , striding into a two-chair barber shop in some one-horse Minnesota town . " Keep up with the times , " he would say , unpacking samples of Tiger Root and Pinaud 's Lilac Vegetal . " Look to the future . Have a cigar . " <P> Then , with the routine purchases safely inked into his order book , he would make the big try . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit to the proprietor , " and you might say dollars do n't come easy , and why should I spend mine on one of these new , illuminated , revolving , high-visibility barber poles ? And you 'd be absolutely right ; everyone knows where your shop is . But sometimes a reminder will make a man buy before he really needs to . For instance , you might be walking down the street without any idea of being thirsty , and suddenly you see a sign that says Blatz Beer . " The barber 's pride of profession would take over , and he 'd contract to replace his old pole - often a hand-striped water tank or section of stovepipe-with one of the up-to-date models . " You may not notice an increase in business the next day , or the day after that , " Marvy would say , " but over the course of a year ... "
