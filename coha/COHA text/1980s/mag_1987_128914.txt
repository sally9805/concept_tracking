The problem when you shop for horses is not how to get them into the shopping bags . It 's money . You need lots and lots of money . Or you need lots and lots of horse sense . Trainer Richard Mulhall has plenty of the latter . At the Hollywood Park sale of 2-year-olds a year ago , Mulhall had a budget of $35,000 , and he spent $39,000 . To be sure , the extra $4,000 was well spent . // On Sunday , Mulhall 's bargain-basement gelding , Chart The Stars , held off the leg-weary challenges of Alysheba and Temperate Sil , a pair of more highly regarded 3-year-olds , to win the 50th running of the San Felipe Handicap at Santa Anita . Chart The Stars , who went off at 7-2 , No. 3 with the bettors , covered the 11/16 miles in 1:43 . Jockey Eddie Delahoussaye steered the gelding through a tiny opening on the rail as the horses came out of the final turn and gave Mulhall his first Grade I stakes victory , worth $107,450. // Mulhall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and is based at Santa Anita . Yet the track 's p.r . department did n't even have a file on him . File this : Mulhall says he started as a rodeo cowboy , riding broncos and bulls . For five years he galloped and groomed thoroughbreds for trainer Willie Molter . At 21 , he started his own stable . // Which wo n't be confused with the one D. Wayne Lukas runs across the road from Mulhall . Mulhall trains 22 horses . Lukas has nearly that many ( 17 , to be exact ) nominated for the Triple Crown races . Lukas buys horses for such plutocrats as Eugene Klein . Mulhall owns Chart The Stars with Jack Arnold , Wally Clearman and Chris Clark , who are , respectively , a developer , a restaurateur and an equine-insurance man . // " I had to pull teeth to get them to go to $39,000 , " Mulhall jokes . Actually , what he did was become a partner . Mulhall owns 17 ? % of the horse ; the others each have 27 ? % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 1979 Eclipse Award-winning sprinter , out of Fair Astrologer . Two months after his current owners bought him , Chart The Stars started getting too rambunctious . His neck also became overdeveloped , which affected his conformation . So they had him gelded . He then finished second in his first three starts , all sprints this winter at Santa Anita . On Feb. 15 , Chart The Stars broke his maiden in a 6 ? - furlong race . On March 7 , he placed second in the $158,500 San Rafael Stakes , five lengths behind Masterful Advocate , a $5,500 bargain who is the favorite for the Santa Anita Derby on April 4 . Mulhall says that if Chart The Stars " runs decent " in the Santa Anita , he will ship him to Louisville for the Kentucky Derby . // The San Felipe was supposed to be a race of redemption for the two colts with the tony bloodlines , Alysheba and Temperate Sil . Both were coming off disappointing first runs as 3-year-olds . Temperate Sil , the soundalike son of 1980 Belmont winner Temperence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masterful Advocate , in the San Rafael . Trainer Charlie Whittingham blamed that performance on an off track . // Alysheba , a bay son of Alydar , had run fourth in an allowance race at Santa Anita on March 8 . " We 'd rather he done that than knock himself out , " says trainer Jack Van Berg . " I would n't trade places with nobody else right now . " // But Sunday 's race belonged to Chart The Stars . Going around the far turn , he was boxed in . Delahoussaye thought the gelding was going to hit the rail , but Something Lucky proved to be just that for Chart The Stars . He drifted slightly and Delahoussaye slipped through . // The winner finished three quarters of a length ahead of Alysheba , who charged into the stretch four wide but then lugged in before the finish . Alysheba finished 2 ? lengths in front of Temperate Sil . Something Lucky faded to fourth . Two Lukas horses , War and Barb 's Relic , both coming off impressive wins , finished fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the early Kentucky Derby favorites in Capote and Talinum. // Mulhall was shopping again on Sunday at Hollywood Park before heading to Santa Anita . He did n't buy any stock , but , then , this was a day to celebrate . There will be other days to buy horses . Sunday was a day to buy champagne .
