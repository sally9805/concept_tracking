RV <P> Sometime in 1891 , Robert Louis Stevenson completed a novella-length narrative about the South Pacific called The Beach of Falesa . By this time , the Scottish-born and immensely popular author was living in Samoa , at a far remove from his publishers in London and New York City ; an answer to a letter sent by steamer mail took three months to return . As a result , Stevenson delegated loose authority over his manuscripts to several confidants , to speed up both the process of getting into print and the payment of his royalties . But editors on both sides of the Atlantic were perturbed by certain aspects of The Beach . Changes were made by several hands to protect Victorian readers from tropical immoralities . When Stevenson finally saw the serialized version in a London newspaper , he complained of " the slashed and gaping ruins " of what he had written . <P> The tale of how this censorship occurred is the first and by far the longer part of this volume . Editor Barry Menikoff , a professor of English at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melodrama and skulduggery : " A story of stylistic abuse by printers and proofreaders , of literary abuse by publishers , editors , and friends , and finally of the abuse of art by Stevenson himself in sanctioning the publication of a corrupt text . " <P> Unfortunately , the evidence does not live up to these lurid claims . Menikoff devotes 23 closely printed pages to the nefarious fiddling that went on with Stevenson 's punctuation and spelling ; the imposition of " house styles " by various publishers was , of course , common during Stevenson 's lifetime , and is not entirely unheard of today . On a more substantive level , some sexual undertones in the story were muffled , and some mildly profane or irreligious sentiments were excised or rendered inoffensive . These changes now seem fatuous , but they did not accomplish what Menikoff asserts : " A finished and artistically sophisticated novel was reduced to a vulgar and meretricious shadow of itself . " Henry James read this supposedly mutilated text and praised " an art brought to a perfection . " Critic George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " almost as good a story as ever was written . " <P> Fortunately , Menikoff includes the original version of The Beach of Falesa , which is roughly half as long as his scholarly preface and many times as interesting . The story Stevenson intended is a bit grittier and more pungent than the one that appeared . A vagabond British trader named Wiltshire tells of being assigned to reopen a defunct post on a remote island . He is befriended at first by a man called Case , who enjoys a trading monopoly . Case persuades the newcomer to take up with Uma , a beautiful , half-naked native girl , and arranges a sham wedding ceremony . Before long , Wiltshire falls in love with his concubine and marries her properly ; he also realizes that he and Case are deadly enemies .
