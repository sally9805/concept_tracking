A relevant factor in the long-playing record vs. compact disc debate is the type of music being played ( MUSIC , Aug. 25 ) . The average listener tends to play music that is produced in the studio . Music that has never had a live performance is not likely to suffer from the synthetic nature of the CD . Serious hi-fi listeners , on the other hand , are more likely to revel in live classical and jazz performances . This music cries out for realism , ambience and imaging ( the accurate placement of instruments relative to one another ) . The LP currently has an edge in these qualities . <P> Ken Phelps <P> Ladysmith , B.C. <P> Most people can not invest thousands of dollars in stereo gear , yet want to enjoy their favorite artists on records that give them clear sound . The compact disc has finally made that a reality . As the price of the players and CD 's drop , more people will be enjoying the simplicity of listening to music without the noisy negatives of LP 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more elegant technology . <P> Ian Barondess <P> Tarzana , Calif . <P> ! Why should I spend nearly $3,000 for a turntable that still has problems , like warped and off-center records ? The sound produced by the compact discs may not be impeccable , but with proper care CD 's will last for 10,000 plays , while LP 's will at most survive 100 plays before record wear takes over . <P> Raymond Chuang <P> Sacramento
