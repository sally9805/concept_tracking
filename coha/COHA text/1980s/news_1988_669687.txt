What they do find surprising , however , is the remarkable resilience of education reform : It remains a top priority among business leaders , legislators - and especially parents. // Experts who thought the demand for better schools would burn out after its quick rise to the top of the national agenda in the early ' 80s have been proved wrong , says Denis Doyle of the Hudson Institute : ' ' Education reform is being sustained . We ' re in a rare watershed period in which , both for reasons of virtue and a more competitive work force , everyone needs an old-fashioned liberal arts education - needs to know how to talk , write , read , and think. ' ' // // In the coming year most action on school reform will occur at state , district , and school levels. // Chief among potential reforms are ( 1 ) the concept of restructuring schools to allow a more decentralized flow of power , with the teachers and principal tailoring their school to meet specific needs ; and ( 2 ) the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge in such fields as history , science , math , and geography , as well as mainstream culture. // Also on the reform agenda are more efficient and equitable school funding , greater choice of schools for parents , higher standards , new technology , and richer learning content. // Though still a fist-sized cloud on the educational horizon , parent involvement is fast emerging as an important theme. // From the New Haven , Conn. , elementary schools , where parents help to design and then work in classrooms , to Horace Mann Elementary in St. Paul , Minn. , where every Friday teachers write home to parents about each child ' s progress ( and expect a signed letter in return on Monday ) , parents are being asked - and are demanding - to be part of their children ' s schooling. // ' ' The parents ' movement is growing , ' ' says Joseph Nathan , an education consultant with the Spring Hill Conference Center . ' ' The evidence is clear that when parents and teachers work closely together , students do better and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show parents how to supplement their children ' s education - tips like keeping a globe or atlas by the TV to show where Iran , New Zealand , Afghanistan , and Kansas are. // Allowing parents a choice of schools within or outside their district continues to be a fast-growing reform strategy . Schools of choice are often organized around disciplines such as science or the arts , or traditional or ' ' progressive ' ' forms of education . Gov . James Thompson of Illinois recommends that the ailing Chicago school district become a choice system. // Merit schools in Florida and South Carolina - schools that are rewarded for the collective achievement of principal , teachers , and students - are receiving more attention . As do choice schools , they depend on teacher cooperation and involvement , and thus improve overall school morale . According to the Center for Policy Research in Education at Rutgers University , more than 100 districts in 18 states allow schools to set their own curricula , staffing , and budgetary policy ( rather than imposing these from the top. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finn , won ' t discuss reforms like ' ' restructuring ' ' and ' ' literacy . ' ' These are ' ' trendy buzzwords , ' ' he says , that allow educators to fiddle with the process of schooling while ignoring the harder question of content. // ' ' After five years of reform , nobody has yet described the product schools are supposed to produce - what kids should know to enter adulthood , and how to make schools accountable for teaching it , ' ' he says . ' ' The organized forces of American education flee from the responsibility for outcomes. ' ' // Dr. Finn advocates national education standards . Dr. Doyle concurs that a consensus is building for a core curriculum : ' ' Not the back-to-basics crazies , but a sophisticated core teaching that stresses analysis and underlying themes . ' ' High standards dictate high levels of content. // California ' s textbook reform begins to approximate such standards . Math and science books require more problem-solving ; reading books with traditional stories replace formulaic writing ; history texts must stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with often-ignored religious , economic , and political causative factors behind events such as the American Revolution and Civil War . Tests will match textbook content. // Vocational education may be in for a change . Minnesota is experimenting with putting shop skills such as woodworking and mechanics into the regular curriculum . Even honors students would have to get their hands dirty in a new ' ' applied curriculum. ' ' // Arkansas is adopting a plan that will allow high school juniors and seniors to enroll in college for part or all of their courses. // On the finance front , there ' s little probability of continuing the 30 to 40 percent increases in state and local education spending that have taken place since 1983 . Average state spending has leveled off at a 7. 4 percent increase for fiscal year ' 89 . To redress the balance between have and have-not schools ( the inequities run as high as $3 , 600 per pupil ) , districts from Texas to New Jersey are suing states for more funds under a form of an ' ' equal protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans . Iowa , for example , allows some districts to share such costs as a single superintendent ' s salary or to share classes to avoid duplicating special courses such as German or physics. // High-tech continues to make inroads in the classroom . ' ' Expect to see more interactive video instruction , ' ' says Allan Odden of the University of California at Los Angeles . Experts say that successful video teaching - such as the United States Naval Academy ' s foreign language program , which uses a laser disc of the children ' s puppet theater from French TV - will spread. // Doyle feels public schools will slowly follow the lead of experimental private schools . Longer school years to avoid ' ' summer learning loss ' ' - Beacon Day School in Portland , Ore. , is open year-round - might be one such outcome , especially for needy children. // Finn recommends giving principals shorter contracts . ' ' Give them three years to succeed . Give them a fat reward if they do . Let them go if they don ' t. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy . Monday : The federal role. // //
