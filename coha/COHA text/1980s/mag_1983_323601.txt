For one night , understudies step into the spotlight <P> Usually they have to wait for someone to break an ankle or catch the flu before they are allowed to sing those songs in public . But for one night last week at Manhattan 's Town Hall , they held center stage , belting out lyrics for which they are not at all famous . A wistful young woman named Tracy Shayne gave her plaintive interpretation of What I Did for Love from A Chorus Line ; Rhonda Coullet , helped by a regular cast member , Cass Morgan , did a comic number from Pump Boys and Dinettes ; and Ruth Brisbane brought down the house with the sexy The Right Key but the Wrong Keyhole from One Mo ' Time . <P> Waitin ' in the Wings , sponsored by Manhattan Community College , was a tribute to the theater 's least seen and , by definition , most obscure performers , the understudies . " They are always ready , rarely called upon and least appreciated , " said Vincent Sardi , owner of Sardi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most frustrating occupations in the country : being prepared to go on if something befalls someone else . <P> In some productions that happens frequently . Rock Star Andy Gibb , for instance , was eventually fired from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat after missing twelve performances in little more than a month ; George C. Scott failed to appear twelve times last year during the six-month run of Noel Coward 's Present Laughter ; and Frank Langella missed 28 performances during his half year in Amadeus . On any given night , several of the felines in Cats may be substitutes . By contrast , the indestructible Marian Seldes was never out once during 1,793 performances of Deathtrap , and except for vacations , those three iron ladies , Lauren Bacall , Raquel Welch and Debbie Reynolds , have danced their way through every matinee and evening of Woman of the Year . <P> Broadway lore has numerous burbly stories of brave understudies suddenly being called in to take over , at which point a famous agent or director notices them and sends them on to stardom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacLaine , who won a Hollywood contract after subbing for Carol Haney in Pajama Game . But even the understudies find it difficult to believe that such things actually happen . " Those who think that being an understudy will lead to opportunities are wrong , " says British Actor Daniel Gerroll , who covers for Edward Herrmann in Plenty . When a star leaves a play , understudies rarely become replacements . Doug Voet , who covers the lead in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat , has been passed over three times . Says he : " It was devastating , but I ca n't let it get to me-at least not in public . Being an understudy is like being a guest in your own home . "
