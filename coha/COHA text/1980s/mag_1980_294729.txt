The press could cover better what has happened if it were not so preoccupied with trying to guess what is going to happen next . This occupational tic , this desire to sound " knowing " about the not yet knowable , is what makes so much journalism quickly forgettable . The urge is highly visible during the Reagan interregnum , with Washington reporters and columnists desperately inflating every little nod about future policies , or hint about appointments , from the Reagan camp . <P> The same desire to hunch the future led to the debacle of the pollsters at election time . In their own defense , pollsters have just about persuaded everyone that there was a dramatic change in voter opinion in the last week before the balloting . Even if this is true , however , of what use to anyone were the pollsters ' " too close to call " findings just a week before an electoral landslide ? <P> Overemphasis on the polls had some interesting consequences . Historians will debate how much Carter 's irresolution and waffling stemmed from too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Washington Post 's Haynes Johnson blames himself and his press colleagues for basing so much coverage on polls , then writing learned analysis claiming to know what was on people 's minds . Wrote Johnson : " As it turns out , reporters would have been better served by relying on their own legwork , which in turn produces their own political instincts . " <P> Still , reader curiosity about the future may be insatiable : How else explain the popularity of astrology columns ? Probably the most ambitious and serious attempt to hunch the future was the Carnegie Corporation-financed Commission on the Year 2000 , a gathering of distinguished scholars directed by Harvard Sociologist Daniel Bell . It met in the ' 60s but petered out by 1972 . " It makes no sense to predict the future , " says Bell . " There are too many contingencies . What you can do is identify relevant frameworks , and identify problems-but you do n't know what will be done about them , which is the function of political will . " <P> A lively new magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inc. , has found a popular niche by concentrating on " two , five or ten years down the road " and has doubled its initial circulation of 200,000 in its first year . Sometimes , to get attention , it asks unanswerable questions on its cover ( " Will There Ever Be a Jewish President ? " ) . Its current issue , hailing the 1980s , proclaims it the Decade to Remember , foreseeing " fat and not lean years , " a revival of Yankee ingenuity , and major advances in medicine .
