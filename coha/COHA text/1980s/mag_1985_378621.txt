Ask most boys what they are going to be when they grow up , and they might answer that they want to be a policeman , an astronaut or whatever Daddy is . But when someone asked Jonathan Sheer , 12 , that question , he answered without hesitation : " I want my mother 's job . " <P> Jonathan 's mother Jane Evans is the president of Monet ( estimated 1985 sales : $120 million ) , part of Crystal Brands . Evans sees her son 's answer as a sign of the times . Says she : " If a boy had said that 20 years ago , people would have assumed that his mother was a secretary . " Today Mom may be an executive . <P> Women are now setting their corporate goals high , and more and more are achieving their ambitions . Between 1972 and 1983 , the number of executive women in U.S. business more than doubled , from 1.4 million to 3.5 million , and it is still climbing . Says Harvard Labor Economist David E. Bloom : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the single most important change that has ever taken place in the next 20 years . " <P> Only one woman , Katharine Graham , chairman of the Washington Post Co. ( 1984 sales : $984 million ) , heads a FORTUNE 500 company . Her family controlled the Post when she took over in 1963 .

They are moving higher on the basis of talent , not family ties . Perhaps the most highly placed of these bootstrap female executives is Verna Gibson , who in May was named president of Limited Stores ( see box ) . With estimated 1985 sales of $800 million , Limited Stores is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those executives , advancing through the ranks in banks , manufacturing companies , retail firms and service corporations are thousands of ambitious young women . Says Rand Corp . Economist James P. Smith : " They are in the pipeline in middle management now . It is inevitable that after 20 years of work experience , a good number of those women will be at the top . " <P> Companies have discovered that selecting only male candidates means ignoring about half of the best talent available , and many are now actively recruiting women managers . Says Caroline Nahas , a partner at Korn/Ferry International , a Los Angeles-based executive-search firm : " More and more companies realize that a good manager is a good manager regardless of sex . " <P> Some firms were quicker than others to regard women as executive timber . In his latest book , Innovation and Entrepreneurship , Management Expert Peter Drucker reports that New York 's Citibank was one of the first major companies to go after female M.B.A.s , in the 1970s . Recruiters who were sent out in search of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to headquarters that many of the best graduates were women , not men . The bank told them simply to hire the best .
