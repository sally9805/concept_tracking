onsider the process by which a modern integrated circuit is made . A wafer of silicon is doped with impuri , ties , exposed to light that is shone throligh a template to form a pattern of shadows , treated with new impurities that differentiate between the irradiated and unexposed areas , etched by a bath of corrosives , blanketed with a new surface of silicon , exposed to another pattern of light , and so on , until a marvelously complex three-dimensional system of switches , gates , resistors , and connections has been laid down . This system may be destined to become part of a computer that will in turn help design new integrated circuits . The technical term for this process is " photographic . " An integrated circuit is essentially a very complex silicon photograph . Photographic techniques are now being used to make all kinds of tiny machines ? solar energy collectors , pumps , and measuring devices . We normally think of a photographic process as one that makes pictures of things rather than things themselves . A photograph is significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a bit of sticky paper . But our silicon photograph does n't merely represent something ; it does what it is a photograph of In a sense it is a miraculous picture , like that of Our Lady of Guadalupe : it not only depicts , but does ; it is not just a representation , but reality ; it is not just a piece of knowledge , but a piece of being ; it is not just epistemology , but ontology . Consider , moreover , the digital , or Soundstream , method of reproducing music . The music is scanned every forty-four thousandth of a second or so , and the sound wave activity in that forty-four thousandth of a second is given a numerical value . This value is recorded in terms of a binary sequence of laser-burned holes and unburned spaces on a record . To play the record you just scan the holes with another laser and synthesize a sound that corresponds to the number you get every forty-four thousandth of a second . A digital recording is really just a sophisticated musical " score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the music , the way the grooves in the plastic of a normal record do , any more than the five parallel lines , the clef , and the little black ellipses with tails reproduce the sound of the music ? or , indeed , than the letters on a page reproduce the sound of speech . In a sense , the digital recording harks back to an antiquated device for reproducing music : the player piano . The interesting thing is that digital recordings are much more accurate than any analog recording could be . They are literally as accurate as you want : you could scan music every hundred thousandth of a second Frederick Turner was formerly the editor of the Kenyon Review . His epic poem , The New World , will be published next year . role-playing games ? Voyager , Wizardry , Dungeons &; Dragons . The space program was too slow to bring those other worlds to them , so they constructed them right here on earth . Play has become increasingly practical : it is almost as if an evolutionary necessity dictated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid future of the species . Just as it began to seem that political , economic , and technological forces were combining to organize the human race into a rational , centralized , and anonymous unity , and that the world was , as they say , becoming a small place , counterforces started taking us in completely new directions . The new electronic technology is by nature playful and individualizing . The strong hand of the corporation and the still stronger hand of the state , which were once able to coerce the population into service by cutting off the sources of energy and information , are losing their hold . Quite soon a family with its own solar power generator and its own computer will have the kind of practical sovereignty once possessed only by nations . Remember the scene in Close Encounters of the Third Kind where the kids ' mechanical toys all wake up and , in their dim electronic awareness , run about on the floor and clap their hands and flash their lights ? And how the music of the aliens is actually a variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star " ? We have met E.T . , and he is our toys , our animated cartoons , our computer programs . We are re-entering at last the ancient animist universe , populated by genies and geniuses of place , in which every object possesses a demon that one might control and use . But the nymphs and dryads are now microprocessors inhabiting our cars , our stoves , our clocks , our chess sets , and our typewriters . Soon everything will have its own dedicated intelligence , its own nisus , or animating will . We are at a curious juncture in the history of science and technology . The empiricism of the Renaissance gradually flattened out the ancient hierarchy of the universe and broke up the Great Chain of Being . But just when the world seemed to have been reduced to a collection of objective facts ? the world view of modernism ? a new order began to come into being . The new Great Chain of Being , unlike the old one , is dynamic and fluid : it is the great branching tree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realm of biology , it did not seriously threaten the modernist vision of the world as " value-flat " ; it simply made of life a mystical anomaly , a " fever of matter " in the " frozen chastity " of the inorganic , as Thomas Mann put it . But now we can create viruses out of " dead " chemiIllustrations by Marc Yankus cals , proving they were not as dead as we thought . The link has been made . All of the world is alive . The destruction of the old coherence is best illustrated by the collapse of the meaning of the word " art . " In The Tempest it is Prospero 's " art " that makes temporary sense of the airy nothing the world is made of , rendering it into cloud-capped towers , gorgeous palaces , solemn temples , even the Globe theater itself . For Shakespeare " art " meant science , philosophy , technical power , craft , theatrical sleight of hand , liberal education , magic , and " art " in our modem meaning , all at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of full cultural health and integrity . " Art , " the word , was gradually torn to shreds , until in our century art and science , science and technology , philosophy and science , art and philosophy , magic and science , craft and art , education and art , have all been set against one another , like demons bred out of the corpse of the great mother . ? But coherence is swiftly returning . The indeterminacy principle , which destroys the distinction between observation and action , makes all science into technology and all technology into science . Academic philosophy has died and passed its inheritance on to the theoreticians of science and the art critics . Anthropologists have revealed other cultures ' magic as science and our own science as magic . In all the arts , the death of modernism has given birth to a rapprochement between craft and art , and art is , once more , properly required to be moral . All of these assertions are more prophetic than scholarly , but watch out . Not that the empirical detour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theater , and we needed three centuries of self-imposed alienation , of tearing things to pieces to see how they worked , to be able to come back to a coherent world , this time with the powers and knowledge we always felt were our birthright ? powers and knowledge we had mimed with magic . But now that we have come back we must cast away the habits of exile ? the self-contempt , the illusion of alienation , the hatred of the past , the sterile existentialism , the fear of the future , the willful imposition of meaninglessness on a universe bursting with meaning . Another way of saying the same thing is that we are undergoing a of itself as a religion , rather than the way things are . " The main challenge to materialism was the discovery that the atom is not irreducible , and the consequent dissolution of matter into event , relation , and information . One of the advantages of materialism is that the further one goes in explaining the complex and ambiguous behavior of the apparent world in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . mbiguous it seems to be . Religion seeks certainty , and for a long time materialism delivered it . But one more reduction , one last simplification , spoiled everything . Suddenly the world , as it was revealed by quantum physics , became utterly ambiguous again . Much that is good can be salvaged from the old religion . The world of matter , though it has been shOwn to be a provisional one , without the appealing absoluteness it once possessed , is still beautiful and exquisitely ordered ; and surely we should give it a share of worship . But if we do so , we must give a greater share to ourselves , both as the supreme product of matter given the chance to do what comes naturally and as the supreme observer and shaper of the material World . That aspect of religion that appeals to the desire to worship something outside of , and superior to , ourselves will not be satisfied any longer with materialism . And materialism has always carried a dangerous flaw : its fundamental parts , the atoms of matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is precisely what makes them intelligible . But the elevation of matter implies the superiority of those characteristics ? impersonality , insentience , unintelligence . The personal , the sensible , and the conscious came to be seen as a second-class reality that must face up to the impersonal ' ' real world " and submit to the " reality principle " : the blind forces of economic change , the dialectics of class struggle , the survival of the fittest . Perhaps our great political and technological monsters ? communism , fascism , the hydrogen bomb ? are the final expression of that suspicion of the personal : they promise to eradicate persons from the face of the earth . No wonder that the earth expresses itself outwardly in leaves , it so labors with the idea inwardly . The atoms have already learned this law , and are pregnant by it .... The very globe continually transcends and translates itself , and becomes winged in its orbit , Even ice begins with delicate crystal leaves , as if it had flowed into moulds which the fronds of water plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself is but one leaf , and the rivers are still vaster leaves whose pulp is intervening earth , and towns and cities are the ova of insects in their axils . The biologist A. G. Cairns-Smith recently suggested that there were , before the DNA-based life we know today , more primitive ways of self-replicating and metabolizing . In his book Genetic Takeover and the Mineral Origins of Life he postulates the existence of a silicon-based clay " organism , " a halfway house between dead matter and life , which evolved until it was able to assemble and use complex carbon-based molecules ? the forerunners of DNA ? to perform necessary metabolic tasks . These molecules made up , as it were , a part of the " body " developed by the silicate " genes . " In time they became independent of the clay organisms they had served and began to develop on their own . Thus the difficult question of the origins of DNA is answered . Not least among the implications of this idea is the notion that what is now the genotype ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its phenotype ? its blueprint expressed in physical terms . We do not need to go to Cairns-Smith 's work for an illustration . There are many instances when the mechanism used by the genetic material of viruses or bacteria to promote its own survival has become incorporated into the material itself , as in the case of the plasmids ; and the messengers of DNA often perform some of the functions of DNA itself , as when viral RNA takes on part of the responsibility for carrying the genetic inheritance . A fascinating analogy suggests itself : perhaps our traditional ways of storing and passing on information , through speaking , writing , and data processing , are now taking over the genetic tasks of our species , just as , if Cairns-Smith 's theory is correct , the organic molecules that were once its tools superseded the genetic functions of the clay . To Descartes and Berkeley , the distinction between being and consciousness was so absolute as to require divine intervention to enable them to communicate . That distinction is now only a matter of degree . Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more closely , until , in quantum physics , matter proves less durable than the light in which we see it and evaporates into energy , pure event , if we try to take it apart any further . That nature from which we are supposed to be alienated never existed . The great quantum experiments ? the parallel-slits light experiment , the polarizing-filter light experiment ? show that nature has not made up its mind about what it really is , and is quite happy to have us help it do so . The tradition of philosophy that saw us as cut off from our " true " way of being has collapsed , although it has n't realized it yet . We are nature , and we are as at home here in the world as anything has ever been . For the whole world is made up of such as we ; its physical components are , just as we are , tourists , outsiders , amateurs , getting by on a smile and a shoeshine , and deriving what being they have from the recognition of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantum theories of cosmology suggest that the chance-governed behavior of elementary particles is a sort of " living fossil " of the state of the entire universe in its first moments of existence . In other words , the order of the physical world as we know it through conventional physics and chemistry did not at first exist , but evolved out of chaos . At the very beginning there existed an infinite number of possible states , each with a probability of one in infinity . Nothingness was one possibility , sharing with the others the same infinitesimal likelihood of being true . The fact that one can not pin down an electron simultaneously in any ESSAY 51 one time and place is a remnant of that indeterminacy . The sharpness of reality is a result of the harmonious synchronization of many fuzzy events . Technology is the continuation of the process of evolution by which the indefiniteness of the world gave rise to greater and greater certainty . It is the realizing of the possible , and our machines are only the end of a line that goes back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stable molecules , and the durable coherence of elementary particles to that first moment when possibility resolved itself into a burst of identical photons . n the heyday of high modernism the world of the future seemed impersonal , cool , centralized , inorganic , tidy , sharp-edged. a world-state with equal prosperity for all , tall rectilinear buildings , cool atonal music , abstract art , imagist free verse , novels purified of the fetishism and hierarchy of plot and character ; a world-state without repression , alienation , and ego , free from the shibboleths of honor , beauty , sexual morality , patriotism , idealism , religion , and duty . This future now appears dated , even dreary . It has been shown that yes , indeed , humankind does have a nature ; there are cultural universals . There are rules to be followed if freedom ? limitlessness ? is to come about . And those rules include not only the grammar of language , but also the classical laws of harmony , melody , color , proportion , rhythm , and balance . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sweep them away , thereby damaging the art forms they were trying to liberate and depriving them of their audience . But we are beginning to discover the nature of our humanity as well as the humanity of nature . To put it aphoristically : We have a nature ; that nature is cultural ; that culture is classical . Of course we must redefine " classical " to include the tonality of Chinese and Indonesian and African music , the artistic conventions of the Tlingit and the Maori and the Navaho , the verse forms of the Eipo and the Inuit and the Yanomami . But there are rules to be culled from this panhuman study , and to break them is not a daring innovation but a pointless exercise ? akin to shining a light in our eyes at a wavelength invisible to the retina , or to speaking a sentence whose grammar works on no comprehensible principle . We must change our romantic attitude toward the rules , too , and recognize them not as an imposition but as a biologically and culturally agreed-upon code of communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great mistake of the modernists was to identify randomness with freedom . Freedom lies on the far side of order ; it is an order that has got so complex that it has become self-referential , and thus autonomous . The random is the most complete of tyrannies . The future now looks quite different from the way it once did . Not only is a world-state , thank heavens , out of the question ; we may even be in the last days of the nation-state . A much more decentralized world seems likely : personal , warm , custom-made , organic , untidy , decorated . Our music will be full of melody again , though it will be more incantatory , more rhythmic , with an Oriental quaver . Our visual arts will be mainly represen- 0 tational , with abstraction reserved for decoration , Our architecture will recapitulate the panhuman village clutter , and all functionsdomestic , religious , commercial , industrial , educational , political ? will be jumbled together . Our poetry will be , as all poetry was until seventy years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moral energy , scientific speculation , theology , drama , history . Many of these changes have already begun , though a rear guard of modernist reactionaries still holds much political and economic power , and it will take decades to deprogram middlebrow taste from its masochistic preferences . There will also be a refeminization of the arts . The modernists tended to write off sexual differences as trivial and imposed , and thus , paradoxically , re-formed their norms upon a masculine model . What followed was an attempt pathetic as it now seems ? to provide equality for women by de-manding that they imitate the achievements of men . But the study of sexuality and gender , and of social and biological evolution , has shown distinct differences between men and women . A full , rich , and human culture built upon an exclusively masculine model is impossible , even if women could be trained to fit that model . I suspect that some readers winced when I gave a list of values : honor , beauty , sexual morality , patriotism , idealism , religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reward systems that has very rarely been examined . In the nineteenth century , materialist ethics came together with materialist biology and agreed that there were only two types of rewards : those obviously associated with survival and those obviously associated with re- , production . Two brilliant value systems ? Marx 's , which reduced all value to the economics of survival , and Freud 's , which reduced all value to libi-do ? were the result . Existentialism struggles between accepting these re-wards as preferable to the more complex value systems of a society and rejecting them , and all rewards , as bribes to make us give up our freedom . Under the pressure of these theories , which postulated very coarse re-wards even for very refined behavior , our value systems changed and coars-ened . When people wince at the words " duty , " " honor , " and " beauty , " they are doing exactly what Victorians would have done upon hearing the words " passion , " " desire , " and " sexuality , " or even " money , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victorians , in a last-ditch defense of the older , more complex value system , would naturally have been pained by references to the enemy 's rewards . We , the inheritors of D. H. Lawrence and Jean-Paul Sartre , feel the same old blush come to our faces when we are reminded of all the rewards ? the joy of duty , the satisfaction of honorable conduct ? that we have given up . Not that we are not , often , honorable and dutiful . But we are so in a spirit of taking nasty medicine with good B grace , and we are deeply suspicious of those who enjoy do- new discoveriesdiscoveries their duty . are forcing on us a new value system . The ut pleasures of eating and sex are not the only rewards . Scientists studying the chemistry of the brain have begun to uncover a remarkable variety of rewards , suppressors of rewards , suppressors of the suppressors , and so on . The pleasures of achievement , of insight into the truth , of heroic exertion or sacrifice , of good conscience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repressed or sublimated derivatives of libido . Certainly the higher pleasures enlist the coarser and more obvious ones as reinforcement ; and indeed society uses the coarser and more obvious ones ? for example food , for children ? to train the higher reward systems , to " prime the pump , " so to speak . But the " endorphin high " is as real a reward as orgasm , or as food to a starving man . Nor are hunger and sex the simple survival drives they seemed to the materialists . The study of evolution shows that the division of food played a central role in the religious rituals that defined the human community . What food represents has long been more important than the 2,000 calories a day required for survival . And the comparative study of sexual behavior shows that , far from possessing a feeble and watered-down version of brute sexuality , we are the most sexual of all animals ? we are in heat all the time , we copulate face to face , our females have as powerful a libido as our males @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our closest relatives , the chimpanzees and gorillas ; it is far more powerful than is needed for reproduction . Many anthropologists suspect that our sexuality evolved in tandem with our brains , and that it took on the important function of encouraging the creation of family and social groupings that could nurture the young and promote cooperation through affection . Nevertheless , without the discovery of the higher reward systems , the theories of sublimation ESSAY i3 and repression would still wash . It was the brain chemicals that broke the old ideology . But there is a terrible tragedy here . Endorphins were discovered because certain scientists studying drug addiction asked the obvious , and brilliant question : Why does the brain have receptors designed precisely to respond with extreme sensitivity to the sap of an Oriental poppy ? What was the evolutionary necessity ? The answer , of course , is that those receptors were designed to respond to something else entirely . The poppy resins simply happened to possess a molecular resemblance to that something else ? an opiate produced by the brain to reward itself for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the materialist theory of value has resulted in the cutting off of many of the pleasures produced by the brain chemicals . We are starved for the pleasures of the mind and spirit and soul . The twentieth century is full of angst , which has its source in a thirst for things like glory , sanctity , conscience , and heroism , things which have been forbidden to us . Worse : we have replaced those pleasures with counterfeits ; and as the doctrines of materialism triumphed , first among intellectuals , then among the population at large , so did the use of opium , cocaine , mescaline , cannabis . ( Of course those individuals at the bottom of society , who have always felt cast out , have always used such drugs when they could get them . ) We are only beginning to realize the horrible effects of tampering with the brain 's own reward system by means of drugs . That realization touches us , with the hard thrill of permanent damage , in the very center of our will , our freedom , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ females in heat and food , pressing the pedal that would deliver their shot of happiness ? Or the teenage mugger , sniffing and shaking with his addiction , interested in nothing but the high ' But ? turning again to the future ? as the theory of reward expands to include endorphins , we will once again educate the young to create their own high , and the demand for the substitute will decline . After all , the real thing is , chemists say , fifty times more powerful than the false , though harder to obtain . Any good teacher will recognize a gifted student whose capacity for self-reward has been stunted from birth by parents and teachers who would not challenge him and who feared to nurture in him an undemocratic pride and pleasure in achievement . As you force the unaccustomed juices of pleasure ? in learning , in truth , in beauty , in work ? to flow , the student is almost incredulous . Surely you ca n't mean him to enjoy it ? It 's obscene . You 're teaching him vile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his inheritance , an inheritance paid for by millions of our ancestors , who humanized themselves by ritual , by claiming kin , by the agonizing and delicious effort to articulate the wordless . Paradoxically , then , materialism as the supreme religion began to sicken when we began to make thinking machines , and died when we began to see ourselves as machines for the production of spirit , soul , value . Materialist politics is dying too , and we have come to see our traditional cultures as machines that support the process of soul-making . All over the world , revolutionary forces are championing complex and traditional value systems ? ethnic , religious , and political ? against materialism , whether it be liberal , fascist , capitalist , socialist , or communist . What makes the Vietnamese , the Poles , the Afghans , the Palestinians , and the Irish such dangerous adversaries is not a materialist ideology but religion , traditional education , blood ties , patriotism , a sense of beauty , honor , heroism , duty , and all the rest : the endorphins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any sexual passion , or thirst , or hunger for bread . To a materialist all those beliefs are only distracting games by which we hide the knowledge of death and the reality of our worldly condition from ourselves . But the human race is more deeply motivated by a game than by a reality , and fears losing more than it fears death . From the point of view with which I began ? the collapse of the distinction between knowledge and being , information and reality , representing and doing ? the paradox is no paradox . Reality has always been a game , and our games continue the evolution of reality . We evolved as idealists , teleologists , essentialists , because , by golly , we survive better that way . Teleology is the best policy . Less idealistic animals have less control over the future . e have always been nature 's insiders , and our solidarity with nature is based on the fact that nature , like us , is fallen and is still falling , outward from the chaos of the Big Bang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution we robustly persisted in the belief that objects possessed the powers that the poetic imagination conferred on them : we believed in magic and magical properties . The rose was sick with love , the sword hated its enemies , jewels could enchant or heal , the moon illf was intelligent and a little mad . The world made more sense to us , even though it was inhabited by uncontrollable powers , than it does to the materialists . For them , metaphor and symbol are terribly sad reminders of that world view that was lost , of our alienation from nature . The rose does not really love , nor the sword hate , nor the jewel heal , nor the moon enchant ; they only arbitrarily symbolize those things . Metaphor is a technical failure . All significance is a pathetic fallacy , canals on Mars that we put there by the weakness and hopefulness of our eyes . There is no magic anymore . We had to choose , as Freud saw but denied , between the power to do and psychic health . That time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . We shall be making intelligent and crazy moons , and passionate roses , and fierce swords with microprocessors in their hilts , and jewels with the power to heal . No doubt we will build canals on Mars , if we want , and make it into exactly the place of Edgar Rice Burroughs 's poetic visions . Metaphor and symbol will become programs for transformation , and technological inventions will become the new metaphors and symbols . Our poetry will become less obviously symbolic , for symbols will not be plastered onto the outside of reality but will be a concrete and accepted part of its plot , as the technical hardware is in a science-fiction novel . Facts will be significant , and symbols will be facts . It is not that we shall rise above nature ? one of the goals of modernism . Rather , we shall he nature . We will once more see life , as Edgar says in King Lear , as a miracle , as magic ; but we will see it too as an " art lawful as eating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tale , brings the statue of the dead queen to life .
