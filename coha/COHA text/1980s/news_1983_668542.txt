Burma , the small Southeast Asian country where a bomb blast killed four South Korean ministers and 15 other persons , is sometimes called the " hermit of Asia " for the way it seals its borders from outside influence . At home , Burma is plagued by more than a dozen insurgencies - by groups ranging from Peking-backed Communists to drug smuggling gangs . Ne Win , who seized power in a 1962 military coup , has ordered the predominantly Buddhist country of 35 million to be run with a mixture of economic socialism , international neutrality and tough one-party rule backed by a strong military . Given this blend , it is unlikely the investigation into Sunday ' s bombing in the capital of Rangoon will be an open affair . The Burmese media are controlled by the government . Foreign newsmen - if admitted at all - will probably be given no access to officialdom . South Korea has blamed North Korea for the killings . Burma has had good relations with North Korea and increasingly warmer ties with the South , especially in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the noncommunist world . Internally there are a number of movements eager to bring down or embarrass the central government of Ne Win , who heads the all- powerful Burmese Socialist Program Party . Many of the dissidents are ethnic minority groups who have for decades been waging guerrilla war in Burma ' s mountains and jungles . Some , including one group called the Karens , can be described as true secessionists with real grievances against the government and the predominantBurman race . Others are drug traffickers and all- purpose smugglers posing as political insurgents . The most powerful of these is the Shan United Army led by opium warlord Khun Sa , who over the past two years has taken a beating from both the Burmese and the neighboring Thais . The most potent insurgents in the country , however , are the guerrillas of the Burmese Communist Party . They are backed by China but operate mainly alongsections of the China-Burmese border .

While Ne Win is one of the world ' s most durable leaders , his regime has not been without internal opponents . Most have been silenced through imprisonment or escape into exile . Most recently , several Cabinet-level officials were purged after the government charged them with illegal use of state funds . Key among these officials was Brigadier Tin Oo , a joint vice chairman of the party and a member of the Council of State . Up until a few months ago , he was regarded as a possible successor to Ne Win . Burma has few if any foreign enemies . Even Peking , despite its backing of the insurgency , has tried to maintain friendly ties with Rangoon . Burma has made almost a religion of neutrality . It pulled out of the nonaligned movement - of which it was a founding member - in 1980 , saying the principles of the movement were " dying . " In recent years , Burma has sought and received economic aid and loans from Japan , West Germany , the United States , the World Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
