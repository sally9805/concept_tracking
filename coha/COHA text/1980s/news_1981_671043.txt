( 6 : 08 A.M. Sunday , E.S.T. ) <> We are spending the third day of the Christmas holiday in really wintry weather . Snow has been falling over almost the entire country since this morning . This has made transportation difficult , but both town and country have taken on a festive appearance . It may be more difficult to visit family and friends today using public or private transport , but it is warm enough to take long healthy walks . Not everyone is on holiday , however . The special services are operating as are duty groups in almost all workplaces . They are getting the workplaces ready for tomorrow , which should pass without any disruptions , because production tasks are currently very large and binding on everyone. // In the capital , the planned number of 20 trolleys and 420 buses are operating today but this morning they are almost empty . Warsaw is deep in snow but the main arteries are clear. // In Silesia ' s hard-coal mines preparations are in progress for tomorrow ' s transloading . Coal cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the whole region yesterday , 30 , 000 tons of coal were loaded . Cars for 103 , 000 tons have been booked for today . In Katowice Voivodship last night the work forces of some bakeries were busy making fresh bread for today . The power industry , transportation services and all other services which guarantee the funcing of the Silesian agglomeration were working . Continuous production plants are also working , including some departments of the Katowice steelworks . Preparations are going on for the start of normal production in the entire complex. // Consignments of medicines and food are also being received . Yesterday at Dabrowa Gornicza ( words missing ) station , a train carrying rice from the Soviet Union was unloaded . Ten cars with medicines and food from Austria also arrived . Snow is making railwaymen ' s work difficult . About 2 , 300 people are clearing snow for the Silesian state railways directorate. // Comments on Defections <> <> 6 : 47 A.M. Saturday // ( 12 : 47 A.M. E.S.T. Saturday ) <> A domestic radio service commentator made the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who until recently were ambassadors of the Polish People ' s Republic , one in the United States and the other in Japan , have asked the authorities there to grant them political asylum . It would be difficult to call these actions anything but defection or betrayal , although something more elegant could be found in diplomatic language . But neither diplomacy nor elegance is the point here. // Both gentlemen had been beyond the borders of Poland on many occasions representing our interests . They were representing them in the past decade when numerous mistakes were committed in economic and social policy and when the authorities , among whom they played a principal part , were not on the same track as the public . They represented these interests at a time when the post-August renewal of our country augured hopes for a better future , and also when the country was getting close to the brink of an abyss. // When all is said and done , Professor Rurarz was until recently one of the economic experts in the sphere of international policy and economics . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not until the Military Council of National Salvation stemmed dangerous processes and phenomena , and there was an outline of a chance to normalize political and social life and overcome the economic crisis , and conditions were created for peaceful work and for reconstructing the mechanisms and structures of the state that both our representatives resigned not only from their honorable functions but also from participating in the reconstruction. // The only feeling I have as I reflect on this matter is shame - shame for people who could not produce elementary integrity when they were settling accounts with their own country , with views they had been professing until that date and with their own life histories . I also feel ashamed because they went under the protective wings of President Reagan , whose latest address to the American nation does not leave any shadow of a doubt as to his attitude on matters pertaining to Poland and Poles. // I do not know if Polish law will ever catch up with Spasowski and Rurarz . This is not the point and this is not what I am driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on top of our difficulties and problems on our own , the two gentlemen should remain abroad , aware of the fact that they abandoned the fatherland in its greatest need . I also wish that this awareness should bid them to wipe out from their own heritage and memory the fact that they were the sons of this land. // Soviet Bloc Reaction <> <> 1 : 54 A.M. Sunday // ( 7 : 54 P.M. Saturday , E.S.T. ) <> An unnamed official of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs , interviewed on domestic television , commented on Soviet bloc reactions : // I would like to say the reactions are very varied . As far as the socialist countries are concerned , the concern and unease over the events in Poland and over the development of the Polish crisis are nothing new . They have long accompanied our development and especially when the threat to socialism has become greater and greater . After all , in the recent period that threat had already - let me say even been officially declared . Obviously Poland , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link in the entire defense system of the socialist states . Our allies can not be indifferent to what happens in Poland from that point of view , but not from it alone , but in the political , economic , and every respect. // The interviewer then said : There can ' t be a Warsaw Treaty without Warsaw ? Foreign Office official : That ' s right . That is also why I think one can say-trying to produce a synthesis to bring out ( word indistinct ) of the attitudes of the socialist states - that the introduction of martial law was received as a resolute move to repulse the threat to socialism , and this was supported . Together with this , it was stressed everywhere that this is a solution using one ' s own forces . <> Jaruzelski Aide Comments <> <> 7 P.M. Saturday // ( 1 P.M. E.S.T. , Saturday ) <> Excerpts from a statement by Capt . Wieslaw Gornicki , adviser to General Wojciech Jaruzelski , to Hungarian radio and television correspondents in Warsaw : // The state of emergency which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is merely a temporary solution . A situation such as this can not solve anything in the long run . It can not go on forever . The intention of the Military Council of National Salvation is to bring this state of emergency to an end as soon as possible . In fact it can be revoked at any moment if law and order is restored in the country . I am convinced this will come about soon. // The time is now coming for the much longer second phase . Without going into the details , I would like to assure our Hungarian friends from whom we have learned a great deal - especially on this occasion - that in this second phase , in the process of the restoration of order in Poland and the reform of our mechanisms the intentions of the Military Council of National Salvation are clear and unequivocal. // The military does not govern in Poland . In Poland the country is directed by the Council of State and the Government . The military is only an executive organ which ensures the successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of state power . The military in Poland has no ready-made formulas for restoring the country ' s health ; only society can have such a formula . This was clearly expressed in General Jaruzelski ' s first speech and was repeated in the statement by the Military Council of National Salvation . We shall repeat it as often as it appears necessary. // Socialism in Poland must be firm , and foremost the socialism of order , but socialism which is approved and built by the nation . In my opinion it is precisely with our Hungarian friends that we understand each other best. //
