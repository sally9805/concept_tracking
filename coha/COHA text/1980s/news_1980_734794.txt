txt In late January 1948 , the house of Scribner published in a modest first printing , with no advance trumpeting , a novel by an unknown writer . It has taken a place beyond question in the small company of novels in our century which deserve the accolade of greatness . " Cry , the Beloved Country , " by a South African , Alan Paton , was received with an extraordinarily unanimous spontaneous outburst of high praise from reviewers . It has sold millions , world around , and still sells  --  one of the occasional proofs that a book can attain , by sheer beauty and profundity , bestsellerdom to compete with hyped-up trash . Jesus long ago told us that , " A prophet is not without honor , save in his own country .... " Dealing as the book did with the The Bookshelf " Towards the Mountain " By Alan Paton . Scribners. 32 ( 1 pages , Illustrated . $16.95. gathering tragedy of apartheid , it is not surprising that South Africa was the country least responsive to " Cry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving of the land , loving of its people , white and black , intense in moral feeling , compassionate and perceptive of all involved in its drama . It was made into a film and adapted for the stage , with music , but neither adaptation captured even remotely the nobility and emotional force of the novel . Alan Paton went on to write many other fine books , among them another novel , " Too Late the Phalarope , " the tone and quality of which suggested to several reviewers analogies to Hawthorne 's " The Scarlet Letter , " in a different milieu . It also was a great success . Now , at 77 , Mr. Paton publishes " Towards the Mountain , " the first volume of a candid , strongly felt , eloquent autobiography . It traces his life up to the vast changes in it precipitated by two events , the publication of " Cry , the Beloved Country " in 1948 and In the same year the election in South Africa of an extreme Afrikaner Nationalist regime that so inflamed racial hostilities as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conscience , into moral-political confrontations with the state that he had never anticipated . This , too , was to contribute , in events to be narrated in the second volume , to his stature as a moral figure on the world stage . Yet , though his sense of inexorable tragedy threatening South Africa now is darker than when the two novels were written , it remains for him " the beloved country . " Born in that land , of Scottish heritage , he determined , during some years as a teacher , to master Afrikaans , the form into which the Dutch language evolved among the Boers in that bilingual land . He also has considerable knowledge of the black African tongues of the region . His unswerving opposition to the racist policies of the Nationalist regime led to intense surveillance , many police raids and searches of his house and papers , and for some years a withholding of his passport so that he was unable to travel abroad without accepting permanent exile , which he was unwilling to do because of his love for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and understands his Afrikaner countrymen , saying firmly that " the assertion that the South Africa of the Afrikaner Nationalists is as bad as the Germany of the Nazis is absurd . There are similarities , but the grossest elements of Nazism are absent . " His parents belonged to a puritanical sect , the Christadelphians , or Brothers of Christ . Alan Paton did not walk in that way but became and remains an Anglican of intense commitment , whose religious vision is strongly shaped by the passionate eloquence of the Old Testament prophets . In his childhood home , " the great utterances of the prophets enthralled me , and their visions of that world where the wolf lies down with the Lamb , and they do not hurt or destroy in all that holy mountain . " This is the " mountain " of the book 's title . After studying at Natal University College , in his home city of Pietermaritzburg , Mr. Paton began what he expected to be a lifelong career as a teacher . In a high sense this has proved truer than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school system , for the surprising turns that his career took , as penologist and then as a writer and an activist in politics , all have been teaching roles . In 1935 , at age 32 , he was appointed head of Diepkloof Reformatory , a large , grim institution for black African delinquents , with the challenging charge from the enlightened Minister of Education , Jan Hofmeyr , to convert it from a tight-security prison into a loose-security school . Yet even Hofmeyr said , " It is hard to know what can be done with it . " Mr. Paton 's chronicle of his Diepkloof years , from 1935 to 1948 , and of the failures along the road to an ultimate remarkable success is a compelling section of this book , valuable not only in human Insight but professionally Interesting to penologists . When he resigned in 1948 , coinciding with the ascendancy of the hardnosed Afrikaner government , prospects dimmed for the reformatory to continue on the path along which he had led it .

Fifty years as I look back on it , I come to the conclusion ? not painful or condemnatory  --  that she did not . " He writes of their years together with a blend of tenderness and objectivity . In 1946 , Mr. Paton set out to visit penal institutions in England , Sweden , Norway and the U.S. In the course of that long journey he wrote " Cry , the Beloved Country , " in bits , in hotel rooms , beginning in Norway in September of 1946 . By the year 's end he had finished it . His description of that process is another highlight . Enthusiastic American friends helped him submit it to publishers and before he left for home , in 1947 , it had been accepted by Maxwell Perkins , of Scribners , without so much as the change of a word . For this age it is one of the noble books and Alan Paton one of the noble spirits , though he would shy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be awaited eagerly , will carry him farther " on the road to the holy mountain where they neither hurt nor destroy , towards which one travels , not always hopefully , and at which one never arrives .
