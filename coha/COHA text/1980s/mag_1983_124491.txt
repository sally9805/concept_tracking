PLEASE REPORT BROOKLYN OFFICE BY MARCH 10 . VERY IMPORTANT . BRANCH RICKEY // Roy Campanella , the recipient of the above wire , was one of four black players who , along with Jackie Robinson , appeared in Organized Baseball in 1946 . Robinson 's dramatic breakthrough at Montreal and . the force of his personality so dominate the integration saga that the experiences of Campanella , Don Newcombe , John Wright and Roy Partlow are often overlooked . // The announcement in April 1946 that Campanella and Newcombe had signed contracts with the Dodger organization naturally created less of a stir than had the news of Brooklyn 's signing of Robinson five months earlier . But in both the white and black communities , it reaffirmed the sincerity of Branch Rickey 's efforts to integrate baseball . Fred H. Dobens , the president of the Nashua ( N.H. ) Dodgers , to which Campanella and Newcombe had been assigned , said that the parent club was " carrying out its plan to give deserving Negro players a chance to make good in Organized Baseball down through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Brooklyn Eagle commented that when the Dodgers signed Wright , " The boys in the back room " had scoffed , " ' He 's there to keep Jackie Robinson company . There 'll be no more Negroes in organized baseball . ' " The signing of Newcombe and Campanella proved they were " whistling off key . " They could no longer dismiss Rickey 's activities as a publicity gimmick. // The black press , while welcoming the latest development , debated the wisdom of the choices . Wendell Smith in The Pittsburgh Courier described Campanella as " the best hitting catcher in Negro baseball " and Newcombe as " the most promising hurler . " Sam Lacy of the Baltimore Afro-American displayed less enthusiasm . He withheld comment on Newcombe , with whom he was unfamiliar , but he expressed skepticism about Campanella 's talents . If the Dodgers had obtained the services of " the best catcher in colored baseball , " Lacy saw this as a " distinction that is definitely on the dubious side , " given the poor quality of catching in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its attendant publicity at an end , Campanella and Newcombe embarked for Nashua . They were an odd couple . Campanella hardly even looked like a baseball player . He stood 5 ' 9 " and weighed nearly 200 pounds , a " sumo wrestler pared to catcher 's size , " according to Roger Kahn in The Boys of Summer . Newcombe , at 6 ' 4 " , towered over his companion . A strapping giant  --  Newk then weighed 215 pounds  --  he had the long arms and broad shoulders characteristic of his trade . Campanella , although only 24 years old , was a confident , relatively mature veteran of nine Negro league seasons . The 19-year-old Newcombe harbored doubts about his talents . " I never really thought I had that kind of ability , " he says today . " The Dodgers liked me because I was so big and could throw the ball hard . But I was always wild . I did n't know where the ball was going . " // Campanella and Newcombe , thrust together as the only blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiated an infectious enthusiasm and love for the game . " He had a dash that was always a pleasure to share , " wrote Lacy . // Rickey did n't indoctrinate Campanella and Newcombe as thoroughly as he had Robinson , but he gave them careful instructions on how to behave . Campanella received a letter from Rickey advising him to avoid disputes , ignore taunts and sarcasm , and simply play ball . Before their departure for Nashua , Campanella and Newcombe met with Robinson in New York to discuss the coming season . " The three of us got together because we were embarking on this new idea and we had to have sort of a game plan to find out how we were going to operate as players , " says Newcombe . The trio discussed the difficulties that they might face and agreed to abide by the rules set down by Rickey . Throughout the season , according to Newcombe , he and Campanella kept in contact with Robinson , exchanging ideas and comparing their experiences . // Nashua , wrote Wendell Smith , was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staid in its ways . " Located 40 miles north of Boston , Nashua 's residents appeared to have no qualms about welcoming black athletes . " These people are wonderful , " the ebullient Campanella told the Courier . " Newcombe and I go anyplace we want to , do anything we please and are treated like long-lost sons . " Newcombe and Campanella and their families were the entire black population of Nashua . They rarely saw the other blacks in the area , who lived at a lumber mill several miles outside of town . " We even had to go to the white barber shop , " recalls Newcombe . " He did n't know how to cut black hair . We got scalped many times by the barber who tried .... He could have said , ' No , I do n't cut black people 's hair , ' but he tried . " // Newcombe and Campanella found themselves under the command of Player-Manager Walter Alston . Destined to become one of baseball 's most famous skippers , Alston was , as was Nashua General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascent through the Dodger organization . In 1946 , at 34 , the soft-spoken Alston was concluding an unsuccessful career on the field and had already managed for five years . He had played more than a decade in the minor leagues and in 1936 , in his only at bat in the majors , had struck out . In 1944 Rickey , whose brother Frank had originally signed Alston to a St. Louis contract , offered him a job as player-manager of the Brooklyn Class B farm club in Trenton , N.J. After two years there , Alston moved to Nashua , which played in the Class B New England League . // Rickey did n't consult Alston about whether he would accept the two black players , nor did he give him any special instructions . " Nobody asked me a thing , and I never said a word about it , " says Alston . " They sent me Newcombe and Campanella , and I did n't think too much about it except to wonder how good they were as ballplayers . I was wondering if they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very long before I knew they were both good ballplayers and good guys , " says Alston . " They were anxious to do well , do anything they could to help win a ball game .... When I saw them play a few games I was glad I had them on my club . " // Alston had good reason to be pleased . Both Campanella and Newcombe started strongly at Nashua . Before the first game , against the Lynn ( Mass . ) Red Sox May 8 , Campanella , recalling Robinson 's dramatically successful debut in Jersey City three weeks earlier , commented , " I only hope that I can make as good a start .... I do n't ask for the sensational kind of day Jackie had ; that 's expecting too much . " Campanella 's performance did n't match Robinson 's , but he did n't miss by much . After grounding out in his first plate appearance , Campy stroked two singles and walked in his next three at bats . In the ninth inning , with a man on base , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally impressive in his initial appearance two days later . He retired the first eight men en route to a seven-hit , 3-0 shutout over the Pawtucket ( R.I. ) Slaters . Newk won his first four games before losing a 1-0 decision on June 27 . Nashua fans appreciated Newcombe as a pitcher , but they seemed more delighted with his hitting . " They want to know , " said the Afro-American , " ' Is this guy a pitcher or a hitter ? ' " Newcombe collected two hits in his first game and thereafter became Alston 's most reliable pinch hitter . During one week in June he won two games with doubles and a third with a home run . In one July game , despite a sore arm , he threw a four-hit 7-1 victory , striking out 14 men . He also drove in two runs with a single and two more with a home run . In early August his record was at 8-3 and his batting average .349. // Unlike Newcombe , Campanella did n't enjoy uninterrupted success . After a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which kept him out of several early season games , contributed to his slump . In mid-June his average stood at only .235 . A 21-game hitting streak in July and August , however , brought him up near .300 and into the team lead in home runs and runs batted in. // In the New England League , where most of the players were beginning their careers , the experienced Campanella provided a steadying influence . " I was glad to have him on my club , " says Alston , " especially catching , where he could quarterback the team . " A few weeks into the season Alston approached Campanella with an unexpected proposition . " Roy , you 're a bit older than the other fellows on the club , and a great deal more experienced . They respect you , " Campanella remembers Alston saying . " If I 'm ever thrown out of a game , I want you to run things . " Campanella , though a bit hesitant to accept , was extremely pleased . Thereafter , according to the Afro-American , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with " the handling and removal of pitchers , the injection of pinch hitters and the selection of relief moundsmen. " // In mid-June , during a game with the Lawrence ( Mass . ) Millionaires , umpires tossed out Alston in the sixth inning for arguing about a called strike . He handed over the lineup card to Campanella and departed . Two innings later , with a Dodger on base and Nashua trailing by one run . Manager Campanella made his first strategic move . He sent his roommate to the plate to pinch-hit . Newcombe responded with a home run and Nashua went on to win 7-5 . As the first black manager , Campanella had a perfect 1-0 record . // Unlike Robinson , Campanella and Newcombe were subjected to few beanballs and brushback pitches . This resulted , at least in part , from the presence of Newcombe in the pitching rotation . " I had the ball in my hand , " explains Newcombe . " Nobody was going to bother me . " On occasion , opposition bench jockeys would unleash a torrent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alston , who advised his players to ignore the taunts ; if the insults proved too difficult for them to handle , Alston , as manager , would attempt to curtail them by confronting his opposite number and " asking " him to control his players . Both Campanella and Newcombe ignored the name-calling . " There was n't much that happened , " asserts Alston , a verdict supported by both players . // For both Newcombe and Campanella the 1946 season was a triumphant one . Newcombe won 14 of 18 decisions and two more games in the Governor 's Cup playoffs . He had a 2.21 earned run average . He also demonstrated the batting talents that would make him one of the best hitting pitchers in baseball history . Campanella impressed all observers , not only with his hitting , but with his defensive skills and handling of pitchers . A unanimous choice as the all-league catcher , he finished the season with a .290 batting average and led the team with 13 home runs and 96 RBIs . The Sporting News called him the " outstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press touted Campy as the Brooklyn catcher in 1947 . There was speculation that he might reach the parent club before Robinson . The Sporting News , while more conservative , still labeled Campanella and Newcombe as " two of the top prospects in the Brooklyn chain . " // The successes of Robinson , Campanella and Newcombe during the 1946 season constituted the most significant developments in the campaign to desegregate baseball . However , a " third front , " generally ignored at the time and largely forgotten today , also existed . In the small French-Canadian city of Three Rivers ( Trois-Rivires ) , Que. , Wright , a righthander , and Partlow , a lefthander , both of whom had had brief trials with Montreal , completed their seasons in the Class C Canadian-American League . // Three Rivers is an industrial city some 85 miles northeast of Montreal on the St. Lawrence River . The local baseball team , the Royals , had just joined the extensive Dodger farm system , and the 50,000 residents were especially ready participants in the postwar baseball fervor sweeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and supported the team in a variety of other ways . Merchants provided prizes for the slightest accomplishment by a player . A single might win a free meal , a double maybe a steak dinner . " The kids , every time they came to bat , could win a prize , " recalls Frenchy Bordagaray , the Three Rivers manager in ' 46 . " They gave so many prizes , the merchants did , that the kids ate free most of the time . " // In Bordagaray , Rickey had provided the new Dodger affiliate with one of baseball 's master showmen . A major league player for more than a decade , Bordagaray had served with five different teams . While he had never been one of the game 's leading stars , he had twice batted better than .300 and ranked as one of baseball 's best pinch hitters. // In 1946 the 34-year-old Bordagaray reached the end of his major league career . With so many veterans returning from the war , Rickey asked him if he 'd be interested in a managing job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majors . Furthermore , he needed to collect only one more big league paycheck to qualify for the majors ' newly established pension plan . Rickey discounted his fears for the future . The pension , argued the Dodger executive , was a passing thing ; it would never pay any benefits . The persuasive Rickey won out , though his bad advice later cost Bordagaray thousands of dollars in retirement benefits . // Both Bavasi and Marcel Dufresne , the general manager at Three Rivers , had requested Bordagaray as manager . Bordagaray , who spoke French , chose Three Rivers and became an instant fan favorite , playing the outfield and managing . He hit .363 and won the league 's Most Valuable Player award . // In mid-May the Royals assigned Wright to Three Rivers . Like Alston at Nashua , Bordagaray received neither consultation nor special instructions regarding his new player . " They did n't ask me nothing , " says Bordagaray . " They just sent him . They said they were sending me a ballplayer . " On the Three Rivers team , recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites , Frenchmen , Jewish boys . We had the whole works . The funny thing about it was I never thought of him as black . I just thought of him as a ballplayer . " Raised in the small town of Coalinga , Calif. , Bordagaray had little previous exposure to nonwhites . " I did n't know anything about blacks , " he admits . " I was born in a town where I never saw a black . " // Wright 's own reaction to his new surroundings is not known . Cut from the Montreal team on which Robinson was now starring , and demoted to the C leagues , the only black in the Canadian-American League and in the town of Three Rivers , Wright may well have regretted leaving the Negro leagues . If so , he never mentioned it . His indifferent performance , however , may have indicated his disappointment . // Partlow had n't wanted to go to Three Rivers . When the orders announcing his demotion reached him in Montreal , he deserted the Royals and disappeared . Two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a brief meeting , Partlow agreed to join Wright . // Whatever emotions churned inside of Partlow , when he stepped on the mound in the Canadian-American League , he proved virtually unbeatable . He started his first game for Three Rivers on July 16 , the very day he reported , and walked the first three batters to face him . Remarkably , he then struck out the next three batters and proceeded to fan a total of 10 men before yielding to relief from Wright in the eighth . Three Rivers won 7-4. // Partlow won nine straight games before losing , finishing the season with a 10-1 record . Of the 11 games he started , he completed nine . Partlow also demonstrated his batting talents , with a .404 average . Partlow 's arrival seemed to inspire Wright . He had five straight victories to run his record from 6-7 to 12-8 at the end of the season . Partlow 's appearance also marked a turning point for the Three Rivers team , just as Rickey had promised . Behind his and Wright 's pitching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mass . ) Electrics . On the final day of the season the Royals emerged winners in a tight four-team race . // Partlow continued his rampage during the league playoffs . In the seven-game series against the Rome ( N.Y. ) Colonels , Part-low threw three of Three Rivers ' four victories . He won the opener 12-1 on a four-hitter , was a 13-3 winner in the fourth game and hurled another four-hitter in the seventh , a 10-1 triumph . In the fifth game Wright had his only decision , a 4-2 loss in relief . // Three Rivers faced Pittsfield in the championship series . The teams split the first two games . In the third , Partlow took over . Making his first pitching appearance of the series , he tossed a six-hit , 11-1 victory . The following day he appeared as a pinch hitter in the 11th inning with the score tied 6-6 and two men on base , and he hit a two-run triple to win the game . Wright was the beneficiary of Partlow 's clutch hit . In Game 5 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9-6 come-from-behind triumph . For the second game in a row Wright was the winning pitcher . Three Rivers closed out the series , four games to one , with Partlow and Wright sharing the spotlight , and Partlow was named the outstanding athlete in the Canadian-American League championships . // The Canadian-American League playoffs marked the end of Wright 's career in Organized Baseball . He barnstormed around the nation in the fall of 1946 with the Jackie Robinson All-Stars and played winter ball in Puerto Rico . In January 1947 the Dodgers released him . He rejoined the Homestead Grays and pitched two more years in the Negro leagues . Partlow , on the other hand , had earned an invitation to go to spring training with Montreal in 1947 . There he would be joined by Campanella . Robinson by then would be gone , moving to Brooklyn to become the first black in the majors . Newcombe stayed on in Nashua for another season . // On July 3 , 1947 , Bill Veeck , the ebullient owner of the Cleveland Indians , announced that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus breaking the color barrier in the American League . Ever since Veeck had acquired the Indians the preceding year , observers had considered him the most likely owner to join Rickey in the hiring of blacks . In 1941 , at the age of 27 , he 'd taken over a bankrupt minor league franchise in Milwaukee . Supplementing the traditional entertainment on the field with fireworks , acrobatics , clowns and giveaways , Veeck resuscitated baseball in that city . Five years later , he unleashed the same innovations in Cleveland and attendance immediately skyrocketed . Through it all Veeck never lost sight of the ultimate goal of a successful baseball franchise : to field a winning team . This commitment impelled him to sign Doby. // " When I came to Cleveland , I was almost sure I was going to sign a Negro player , " Veeck wrote in his autobiography . He realized the potential box office appeal of black athletes but ranked that as a secondary consideration . " We were drawing better than Brooklyn , " he says . " That was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those prices , a ballplayer with similar talents . " // Nonetheless , wrote Veeck , " I moved slowly and carefully , perhaps even timidly . " Although the Cleveland Browns football team had integrated the preceding year with few problems , Veeck feared adverse reaction among local residents . " ... if Jackie Robinson was the ideal man to break the color line , Brooklyn was the ideal place , " he explains . " I was n't that sure about Cleveland . " As his first preparatory move , Veeck hired Lou Jones , a black public relations man , to work for the Indians . He assigned Jones to meet with black community leaders and lay the groundwork among Cleveland 's black citizens . Jones also would serve as a " companion and buffer " for the athlete he selected . // In Veeck 's discussions with black sportswriters and other Negro league observers , they repeatedly mentioned Doby , a 22-year-old native of South Carolina , as the top young prospect . Cleveland scouts confirmed this opinion . Following the death of his father , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to East Orange , N.J. In high school , Doby became a spectacular four-letter athlete , good enough to earn a basketball scholarship at Long Island University under Coach Clair Bee . Doby attended LIU for three months before signing with the Newark Eagles of the Negro National League in 1943 . Shortly thereafter , he enlisted in the Navy : He batted .342 for the all-black Great Lakes Naval Training Station team , which often competed against squads with major-leaguers . At the end of the war he returned to the Eagles and quickly established himself as one of the top stars in black baseball . In July 1947 , he was leading the Negro National League in batting with a .415 average and in home runs with 14. // The Dodgers also expressed an interest in Doby . Brooklyn scouts rated him the best young Negro league player . " Oh , you had to like Doby , " recalls former Dodger Scout Clyde Sukeforth . " He could run and he had real good power . " Brooklyn almost signed Doby , but news that the Indians also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith called me and said that Doby was going to be signed by someone else , but he 'd prefer Brooklyn , " says Sukeforth . " So , I spoke to Mister Rickey , but he said , ' By all means , let him go over to the other league . It will help the movement . ' " Rickey also expected that the acceptance of blacks on another team would ease the pressure on Robinson and the Dodgers. // Veeck 's integration strategy differed markedly from Rickey 's . Rickey had , in the words of Cleveland 's perceptive black sportswriter , Doc Young , " planned Robinson 's entrance as carefully as a man would plan building a house of matchsticks . " Veeck felt that the resultant publicity had placed too much pressure on Robinson . " I 'm not going to sign a Negro player and send him to a farm club . I 'm going to get one I think can play with Cleveland , " he advised the Courier at a winter party . " One afternoon when the team trots out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . " Veeck employed this strategy with Doby . As a result , neither Doby nor the Indian players received much forewarning . Veeck formally announced the signing of Doby in Chicago on July 5 . That afternoon Doby joined the club for its game with the White Sox . // Cleveland sportswriters described the atmosphere in the Indian locker room as " tension charged " when Doby entered . But most of the players greeted Doby cordially . Only Les Fleming , a first baseman from Texas , evidenced displeasure , turning his back as Doby approached to be introduced . In the dugout , two unidentified black men in street clothing appeared  --  detectives assigned by the Chicago police to guard Doby. // In the seventh inning of that day 's Indians-White Sox game , less than three hours after he 'd signed a Cleveland contract , Doby made his American League debut as a pinch hitter . " I was so scared . I did n't even know how many men were out , " he told a reporter . He was greeted by a hearty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " teeth chattering " Doby swung wildly at the first pitch . On the next pitch he slammed a " scorching drive " that was foul by inches . Three pitches later he struck out . // Doby found that while his teammates displayed no open hostility , few went out of their way to befriend him . Lou Boudreau and Joe Gordon were exceptions . Boudreau was the Indians ' manager and star shortstop  --  the leader in the dugout and on the field . When Doby arrived , Boudreau personally introduced him to his teammates and warmed up with him on the sidelines . " He imparted , by implication , his desires to the players , " observed a Cleveland correspondent . Boudreau treated Doby as a typical rookie , neither pushing nor patronizing him . Gordon , the respected veteran second baseman , worked with Doby on his fielding and repeatedly gave him encouragement . In one of his first games , Doby struck out , swinging at three pitches . Disheartened , he returned to the dugout , walked past his teammates and sat at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the next batter , facing bench , following the same route as Doby . He sat down next to Doby and also placed his head in his hands . " I never asked Gordon then , and I would n't ask him today , if he struck out deliberately , " Veeck said later . The gesture was not lost on Doby . " After that , every time that Doby went out on the field , he would pick up Gordon 's glove and throw it to him , " recalled Veeck . " It 's as nice a thing as I ever saw or heard of in sports . " // Despite the efforts of Boudreau and Gordon , Doby led a lonely existence . Initially , rumors circulated that the Indians would recruit a second black player as Doby 's companion and roommate on the road . This did n't occur . Jones filled this role during the first few weeks , but he soon returned to his normal public relations responsibilities . When the Indians traveled , Doby roomed alone . In some cities hotels barred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not , and would not , discommode the entire team for one person , " said Veeck at the time . He promised to use " all due haste and what muscle we had " to force changes . But during the 1947 season , the Indians abided by hotel policies . In Chicago and St. Louis , Doby stayed in black hotels . In Washington , D.C. , surprisingly , the previously restricted Hotel Statler accepted Doby as its first black guest . // Doby could turn for solace and comfort to the black players who had preceded him . When the news of Doby 's signing reached Montreal , Campanella immediately wrote to Doby , telling him what he could expect from fans , teammates and opponents . And throughout the season , Robinson and Doby remained in regular contact , discussing their problems and frustrations . " Jackie and I talked often , " recalls Doby . " Maybe we kept each other from giving up . " // " In St. Louis they say that the fans would never stand for Negroes on the Cardinals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 16 New York World-Telegram after the Doby signing . " St. Louis , they insist , ' is too much a Southern city . ' " Events quickly proved Daniel a poor prophet . On the following day the St. Louis Browns defied such conventional wisdom by purchasing the contracts of Hank Thompson and Willard Brown from the Kansas City Monarchs and taking out a 30-day option on the services of Piper Davis of the Birmingham Black Barons . // The Browns signed the black players as an act of desperation . They were firmly entrenched in the American League cellar , 26 games out of first . The Browns ' attendance , never substantial , had plummeted . Earlier that week an afternoon game had drawn only 478 spectators . // Brown , Thompson and Davis possessed undeniable talents . But unlike the Dodgers and Indians , the Browns had n't carefully scouted the Negro leagues . Nor had they examined the character of the men that they had recruited . Brown had long been regarded as one of the best black players . He was a powerful hitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other Negro-leaguers dubbed him the Big Bomb , and in the Caribbean winter leagues , fans called him Ese Hombre ( That Man ) for his home run-hitting prowess . The Browns reported that Brown was 26 years old , but it was widely held that he had long ago passed his 30th birthday . Some observers considered him on the downward slide . Thompson , on the other hand , was a solid young prospect . Though only 21 years old , Thompson batted .347 and fielded well for Kansas City in 1947. // Nonetheless , it seems surprising that the Browns would have taken a chance on Thompson . A product of reform school whom police had twice arrested , Thompson drank heavily and always carried a gun with him off the field . Describing his life he later wrote , " Nothing ever was more serious than baseball . Yes , one thing . Drink . " It appears likely that the Browns had no knowledge of Thompson 's problems , an indication of the haste and lack of planning characteristic of their plunge into integration . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to succeed . A line-drive hitter adept at all infield and outfield positions , he had received strong consideration from the Dodgers in 1945 . Many scouts felt that he would be a standout in the major leagues . Yet the Browns did n't place Davis on their roster . He remained with the Black Barons while a St. Louis scout evaluated his performance . The Browns ' option prohibited him from signing with another club . Brown and Thompson , on the other hand , were brought to the Browns on a trial basis . St. Louis paid the Monarchs $10,000 for their services ; if either remained with the Browns , the Monarchs would receive an additional sum . // Brown and Thompson not only failed to lift the Browns from the cellar , but also did little to boost home attendance . On the road , black fans poured out to see them in New York , Philadelphia and Washington . An Eastern tour in late July attracted 250,000 fans on 12 dates , an unusually large turnout to see the last-place club . But in St. Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardinals had packed Sportsman 's Park , the presence of the two black players had no effect on attendance . // The failure of the Browns ' experiment soon became apparent to all . In mid-August Davis declined an offer to play in the minor leagues and the Browns dropped their option on him . On Aug. 23 , barely a month after their signing , St. Louis released Brown and Thompson . Brown had batted only .179 . Thompson , on the other hand , had earned a starting berth and hit .256 , one of the best averages among the weak-hitting Browns . Thompson asked General Manager William DeWitt for an explanation . According to Thompson , DeWitt looked uncomfortable and advised him , " There are things I ca n't discuss . " Brown and Thompson , the first black teammates in the major leagues , became the first blacks to be cut from a major league roster. // With the Montreal Royals in 1947 , Campanella ranked as the premier black minor-leaguer . Following in Robinson 's footsteps , Campanella experienced few problems . " Jackie made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just another guy playing baseball . " // The Dodgers had kept Newcombe in Nashua so that he could gain experience . He became the outstanding pitcher in the New England League , with a 19-6 record . For most of the season , Newcombe was the sole black on the team and he roomed with a white player , Catcher Gus Galipeau , on the road . The year before , Campanella had roomed briefly with a white player , Joe Tuminelli , a first in Organized Baseball . // Despite numerous rumors of the imminent signing of black players , only the Dodgers , Indians and Browns took the fateful step . Surprisingly , both Rickey and Veeck reinforced the opinion that few blacks were ready for the majors by saying that few qualified players remained in the Negro leagues . The rationale for these proclamations remains unclear . Both the Dodgers and Indians had scouting reports that indicated otherwise . // The failure of Organized Baseball to follow Rickey 's lead more actively sparked protests by radical groups in several cities . When Doby played in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball park and urged the Senators to hire blacks . In California , the local Communist party applied pressure on Pacific Coast League clubs to recruit black players . " The Dodgers ... and the Indians and Browns , too ... have a word for it ... Democracy ! " read a handbill distributed in Los Angeles . " Why not the Los Angeles Angels and the Hollywood Stars ? " In San Francisco , where the Seals had entered " preliminary negotiations " to sign Sam Jethroe , the National Maritime Union passed a resolution in favor of this action . The Seals retreated , citing numerous letters of protest . // The South also felt the impact of the integration breakthrough . Many Southern towns with spring training camps or minor league teams began to reassess their racial policies . Several leagues and communities contemplated the adoption of formal rules preventing interracial play . In Greenville , S. C , where the Dodgers fielded a Class A farm club , fans subjected Bordagaray , who was now managing there , to considerable abuse . " The fans were mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club , " recalls Bordagaray . " They were calling me ' nigger lover ' and everything else . They split my son 's lip wide open , threw a pop bottle at him . " // During the 1947 season , Dan Daniel wrote " The Negro issue in the major leagues is fizzling out . " To Daniel this represented " a good thing " because it indicated that blacks were no longer a " rarity . " Columnist Vince Johnson of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette found " a moral of sorts " in the ability of the St. Louis Browns to simply release black players . " The acceptance or rejection of Negro talent has become more or less a routine matter , " he observed . In reality , many years would pass before blacks in the major leagues would cease to be a rarity and transactions involving them would be routine . // Reflecting on baseball 's experiment in race relations , Robinson once said , " I really believe that in breaking down the color barrier in baseball , our national game , Branch Rickey did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln . " // Rickey and Robinson did n't simply end baseball segregation . Their tours through the South , later emulated by other teams , challenged deeply entrenched Jim Crow traditions . Racial exclusion in most Southern baseball leagues terminated before the onset of the major civil rights agitation . As Rickey noted , " Integration in baseball started public integration on trains , in Pullmans , in dining cars , in restaurants in the South , long before the issue of public accommodation became daily news . " Within two decades , many barriers had fallen for ballplayer , bishop or bellhop . Throughout the nation black athletes represented both the harbinger and the agents of change . Without question , the events unleashed by the historic alliance between Robinson and Rickey significantly altered American society .
