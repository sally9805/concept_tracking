Fake amphetamines are not only lethal but legal-for now <P> The 17-year-old girl in Belvidere , Ill. , seemed to be just one more victim of an overdose of illegally obtained amphetamines . Police , finding the type of pills that allegedly killed her , thought they looked just like " black beauties , " one of several forms in which amphetamines are sold . Analysis showed , however , that they were not amphetamines at all but a combination of substances commonly found in the cold remedies , diet and keep-awake pills sold over the counter in drugstores . The dead girl was a victim of the nation 's latest drug danger : the " lookalike " pill . <P> Though they are made to mimic the appearance of the more expensive amphetamines , look-alike drugs contain no federally controlled substances ( i.e. , with a high potential of dangerous abuse ) . Their primary ingredients are caffeine , a stimulant ; ephedrine , a vascular constrictor ; and phenylpropanolamine ( PPA ) , a chemical cousin of amphetamines . The danger lies not in the kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average diet-aid capsule may contain about 50 mg of PPA and between 100 mg and 200 mg of caffeine , a look-alike capsule can carry 50 mg of PPA and 200 mg to 500 mg of caffeine , which in heavy doses can cause heart or respiratory failure . Says Dr. John Spikes , an Illinois toxicologist : " People hear caffeine , and they think of a cup of coffee . You get between 50 mg and 100 mg in a cup of coffee . The people we 're seeing using these drugs are taking ten to 20 pills at once . " In other words , they can ingest the caffeine of dozens of cups of coffee in one gulp . In the past two years , look-alikes have been implicated in the deaths of at least 14 people in New York , Maryland , Michigan , New Mexico , California and Illinois . <P> For the small manufacturers and dealers who purvey lookalikes , the product yields a lot of money with little legal risk . Says Lieut . Robert Long of the Massachusetts state police narcotics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pills for $45 per jar , or approximately 4 each . Then he goes out to some eighth-grader and sells those same pills for $2 apiece . Right off the bat he 's making a profit of more than $2,000 . " <P> Ads for mail-order look-alikes ( " safe , effective and legal " ) have appeared in publications like Cosmopolitan and Chicago 's Reader and in leaflets passed out at rock concerts and in schoolyards . Ironically , the only instance in which it is not legal to make or sell them is when a manufacturer or dealer claims they are real amphetamines . In that case he can be prosecuted for fraud . But sellers carefully label look-alikes as " stimulants " and often include warnings about maximum dosage . Says Lieut . Long : " Most of these guys are not going to make the mistake of claiming to have something they do n't . They just let the kids think they have it . "
