It was probably the most bizarre story to emerge from the Persian Gulf war . Well-informed Iranians insisted that it was totally false . Equally well-informed Saudis said it was all too true . A Western intelligence source was inclined to believe the Saudis . <P> One casualty of the Iran-Iraq war , the story goes , was a plan by Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini to make the hajj ( pilgrimage ) to Mecca , where thousands of his supporters apparently planned a clash with Saudi Arabian authorities . A Saudi source said that 5,000 young Iranians had applied for visas to accompany the Ayatullah on his pilgrimage . More than that , a number of Iranians carrying forged Pakistani passports were caught two weeks ago after landing on the Saudi coast of the Persian Gulf . The area has a large population of Shi'ite Muslims ; many are known to be sympathetic to Khomeini 's revolutionary ideals , and many are resentful of the country 's royal rulers . <P> The Saudis have been worried that Khomeini 's revolution might spread to their side of the gulf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year resulted in many deaths and shook the country . Recently , Saudi police confiscated truckloads of small arms , ammunition and grenades that had been smuggled into the country . The Saudis suspect that Syria and Libya , which are backing Iran in the war with Iraq , may be involved in the smuggling efforts . <P> Some observers cast doubt on the story , pointing out that the 80-year-old Ayatullah could hardly undertake an arduous hajj in his frail condition-much less a pilgrimage that might lead to his capture by the Saudis in the middle of a battle . Others argue that the Shi'ite zeal for dramatic martyrdom should not be underestimated . Besides , they claimed , Arabic radio broadcasts from Iran have regularly beamed calls for popular uprisings and civil disobedience in the desert kingdom .
