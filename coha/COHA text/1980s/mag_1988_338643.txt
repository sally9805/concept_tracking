He will not turn 40 until July 16 , but Ruben Blades has already given himself the perfect birthday present . Anyone who wants is welcome to share it too . It was an early gift  --  showing up , as it did , some four months before the big day  --  but it casts a wider glow than a forest of candles planted on a piece of pastry . Blades went out and made himself a great record . <P> He has done this before , but always in Spanish . Nothing But the Truth is his first record in English , and , with collaboration from the likes of Elvis Costello , Sting and , most formidably , Lou Reed , he has fashioned eleven songs that range wide and pierce deep , all sharing a similar theme . " Violence is love gone crazy " is the way he puts it , with the same snazzy elan and offhand humor that make him such an affable and adept screen actor . He seems easy with it all : sweeping rock , laid-back jazz , Latin-inflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film set in Hamilton , Mont. , where he is starring in a caper comedy called Waiting for Salazar . ( Acting , Blades insists , is merely a way of subsidizing his musical career . ) " There are eleven different styles of songs on this record , " he says . " I wanted to present a whole fabric of different colors and sounds and put them together on a record the way I remembered radio to be when radio played all different kinds of music . " <P> A perfect record . And it creates the perfect , paradigmatic problem : Where 's the audience ? Radio , like music generally , is tightly stratified , and Blades has brought off a singular aesthetic victory . But who will hear it ? Who will play it ? Previously , albums by the Panama-born Blades were recorded in Spanish and aimed at a Spanish-speaking audience . By making Nothing But the Truth in English , he has risked losing his core audience while still seeming perhaps too ethnic to a wider , whiter one . The record has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a modest 100,000 copies . It has also created a tactical problem : " How do we work it out so I can address both Anglo and Latin audiences ? " <P> Such are the frustrations  --  indeed , perils  --  of panculturism . Blades is particularly articulate about them not only because of his fluent English and a rather startling academic background ( he has a 1974 law degree from the University of Panama and a 1985 master 's in international law from Harvard ) , but also because the problem weighs heavily on a heart that looks to a " society that will be more integrated and fair , where character will be the most important thing , where hearts do n't require visas . " He says his record was n't an attempted crossover , but " more like a ' meet halfway . ' People can relate to any music on earth provided they have a shot at listening to it . "
