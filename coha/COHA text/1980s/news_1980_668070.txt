The lament is starting , and we ' ve heard it all before . If it ' s not Dr. Jack Ramsay in 1974 , it ' s John MacLeod in 1976 or Del Harris in 1980 . They ' ve all thought the Celtics should check their blackjacks and tire irons at the Garden front door and play basketball the way they ' d like to play it . " People have been trying to get me to say something about the officials , " Harris kept saying after the Celtics ' 119-101 opening-game dispatch of his Houston Rockets Wednesday evening , " and I won ' t do that . But a unique quality of basketball is that each game is an interpretation of the men calling it . " Translation : The Celtics beat us up in the first game , and , please , refs , help us out . Oh , Harris was exceedingly delicate and downright diplomatic about it , but between the lines , his intent was clear . " A smart player , " he said , " is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They ( the Celtics ) adjusted , and we didn ' t . " Game 2 of the best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal will be held tonight at the Garden ( Ch. 4 , 7:30 ) , and for the Rockets to win , they will have to do many things better than they did in the first game . The Celtics harassed the Rockets into 23 turnovers , good for 31 points . Boston murdered the Rockets both on fast-break points ( 38-11 ) and on second-chance points ( 29-12 ) . It can be argued that both the fast-break points - which resulted either from turnovers or Rocket misses , naturally - and the points via offensive rebounds were the products of overt Boston aggression , which is not to be confused with first-degree assault , as the Rockets implied . The major issue in Houston ' s mind was the style of defense employed by Dave Cowens on the Rockets ' Moses Malone . Harris called it a " wrestling " style , adding that the only other pivotman to play Malone that way was Washington ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn ' t see it that way at all . " There are no secrets to guarding a guy like Malone , " he explains . " You know they ' re going down low all the time . You ' ve got to know where the ball is coming from , and you need pressure on the passer . It ' s a position game with your feet . You try to beat him to the spot . If he gets the ball in too low , you ' re dead . It ' s strictly a percentage deal . And once he shoots , you ' ve got to screen him off . Maybe somebody else with more rebounding range than I have can think about going for the ball , too , but I just let people like Bird , Maxwell , Robey and Carr do it while I try to keep Malone off the boards . " Malone really doesn ' t fight that hard for position . He does some , but they set a lot of picks for him to give him a mismatch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that I don ' t do anything illegal . I don ' t hold . I don ' t knock people down . I don ' t use my hands . It ' s my feet and my upper body I use the most . " The simple fact is that 6-foot-8 Dave Cowens is the best defensive center in basketball . Cowens is the ultimate combination of intelligence and industriousness in pivot defense , and his tactics are disruptive to the normal casual modus operandi of a Malone , a Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or even a Tim Bassett . Remember that Laker coach Paul Westhead lauded Cowens ' defensive play against Abdul-Jabbar earlier this season by saying that it was " the best defensive job done on Kareem by anybody this year . I usually spend half the game on my feet trying to get the officials to stop a mugging . Cowens just did it with honest defense . " Note the use of the word " honest " and apply it to the present context . When centers can ' t operate as they please against Cowens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case is the officiating duo . It ' s nothing new . Somehow , some way , the Rockets must get the Celtics into a half- court game . " We can ' t run with them , " states Robert Reid . " We ' ve got to make them play with our two big fellas , " meaning Malone and 6-11 Billy Paultz . Del Harris knows this : The Rockets can ' t get outscored by a 67-23 margin in bonus points and expect to go home with a split . Nobody can help them but themselves .
