An energy-saving fee is barred <P> Buddy , can you spare a dime ? Apparently not when it is added to the already steep price of gasoline . Ruling on a suit to prevent Jimmy Carter from imposing a 10 per gal . conservation fee on gasoline , U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson Jr . concluded that the President had exceeded his authority . If the decision is not overturned on appeal , Carter 's already battered energy program will suffer further damage . In addition , the loss of $10.3 billion in anticipated revenues from the fee will tip the precariously balanced fiscal 1981 budget into the red . <P> When Carter announced the impost in March , he based his action on the 1962 Trade Expansion Act , which allows the President to limit imports to protect national security . But five Congressmen and a variety of industry and consumer groups brought suit , charging that since the fee would apply to gasoline refined from domestic as well as foreign oil , it was not covered by the 1962 law . The judge agreed . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax on domestic oil , and it had clearly indicated its opposition to the land of fee the President ordered . Ruled Robinson : " The imposition of the gasoline conservation fee is contrary to manifest congressional intent . " <P> Congressional resistance to the tax has grown so strong , in fact , that there may be enough votes to override a presidential veto . A House Ways and Means subcommittee last week voted 17 to 4 to reject the fee ; and the Senate Finance Committee turned it down 14 to 4 . Members of Congress are not happy about running a budget deficit , but they are much more frightened by the prospect of even a mild gasoline tax in an election year . <P> As usual the Administration did not help its cause by a confused approach to the issue . " The program is rather Rube Goldbergian , " concedes an administrative energy adviser . Because of the bewildering intricacy of energy regulations , there is no guarantee that the fee will apply only to gasoline . Oil companies might be able to increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus giving a nervous Congress further cause for election-year jitters . While the Administration claims the fee would save 100,000 bbl. of oil per day , skeptical industry analysts say the reduction would be closer to 60,000 bbl. per day . <P> The Administration has nonetheless had some success in trimming U.S. oil imports . In April they totaled 6.7 million bbl. per day , compared with 7.8 million bbl. per day for the same month in 1979 . But energy independence is still fathomless barrels away . Last week Saudi Arabia , the U.S. 's largest foreign energy supplier , hiked the price of oil 8% , to $28 per bbl. , thus narrowing the gap with the OPEC nations that charge about $35 per bbl . Defending the tattered and admittedly rather feeble fee to a congressional subcommittee , Treasury Secretary G. William Miller warned : " Backing away from such a moderate and sensible step would send a very troubling signal to the American people , to the world financial markets and to the governments of OPEC .
