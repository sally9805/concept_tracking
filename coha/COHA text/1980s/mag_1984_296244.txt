The immigration is understandable . America is , after all , the land of opportunity , where those who are ambitious can rise . Most of the young men who leave depressed , poverty-stricken Sicily , with its stifling traditions and high unemployment , work their way toward this goal in their new homeland by digging ditches , laying bricks , driving taxis or waiting on tables in restaurants owned by more affluent relatives . But a few do not . Their choice of employer : the Mafia . <P> Cesare ( " Tall Guy " ) Bonventre was one of the latter . When he entered the U.S. 16 years ago from Castellammare del Golfo at the age of 17 , he had few skills beyond a natural ability with a lupara , a sawed-off shotgun . But he was quick and good-looking , and he did have some connections : his uncle Peter was a founding member of New York 's Bonanno crime family and his uncle Giovanni was one of the family 's leading underbosses . Bonventre was impatient ; so when he tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he sought and got something better . He and his pal Baldassare Amato were taken on as bodyguards for Bonanno Consigliere ( counselor ) Carmine Galante . <P> They did their job poorly - or perhaps too well . In July 1979 , three masked gunmen burst into a Brooklyn restaurant in which Galante was eating lunch and cut the old man down in a fusillade of bullets . Bonventre and Amato fled the scene unharmed . Hearing that the police were looking for them , they reappeared a few days later and submitted to questioning . The police , who could prove nothing , suspected that the pair at least had knowledge of the assassination . So did members of the Mob , who viewed Bonventre with a new respect . " It takes such guts to kill your boss , " said a ranking New York consigliere . " That Cesare gained respect for his fearlessness . Many - all - were afraid of a man who could kill his own boss . " <P> The old bosses had good cause for fear as Bonventre , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who stood in his way . " He killed this man . He killed that man , " said the consigliere . " Perhaps he killed 20 men . " Bonventre pressed the man who had once been his patron to yield to him his ownership of a restaurant that he coveted . He forced Mafia Don Frank Lupo , 56 , out of his established territory . The don had to set himself up a new one in Miami . Bonventre bought himself a sleek , red Ferrari and took to wearing evening clothes as he held court at his newly acquired Brooklyn restaurant . Finally , he talked of going to war with the powerful Gambino family . <P> The indictment last April of Cesare Bonventre , along with others suspected of involvement in the " pizza connection , " probably prevented a bloody New York gang war . It also brought an abrupt end to Bonventre 's rapid rise . Before the police could arrest him , he abandoned his $50,000 Ferrari and drove away into the night in a nondescript blue Buick that was registered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
