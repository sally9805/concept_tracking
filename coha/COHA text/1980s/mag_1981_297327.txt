THIS IS ELVIS <P> When Elvis died at 42 in 1977 , he made Frank Sinatra 's signature tune his own Top Ten epitaph . " The record shows I did it my way ... " Wrong . As this ghoulishly riveting compilation of public performances ( on TV , in movies and concerts ) and home movies shows , Presley did it every which way but his . He began as an original-a white man who sang like an angry black and moved like a bad woman-and ended as a bloated amalgam of Liberace and Judy Garland . It was the standard show-biz tragedy , which Andrew Solt and Malcolm Leo document in delicious detail . Today Elvis remains a thriving industry , like Disney ; this film is both a comment on that industry and ( through the authorization of Presley 's mentor , Colonel Tom Parker ) a part of it . The remark of the Hollywood cynic , upon hearing of Elvis ' death- " Good career move " - was prophecy after all . <P> <P> HARDLY WORKING <P> Richard Nixon may one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another Boston Marathon . But it is a mystery why Jerry Lewis would choose to run around , fall down , go cross-eyed or winsome in one more movie comedy . Comedy is a taxonomic term here , not evaluative . The only people laughing at Lewis ' first film released since 1970 are in the movie-supporting players earning their keep by pampering the **26;9576;TOOLONG . Jer , 55 , is still the goony kid from the ' 50s , talking while eating a doughnut , parading in drag , leading a children 's crusade through a Florida shopping mall . Hardly Working has grossed $10 million at the box office , in part because parents are taking tots to see " the original Jerk . " They find themselves attending not a revival but a requiem . <P> <P> JUST A GIGOLO <P> If the Nazis had n't existed , moviemakers of the ' 70s might have invented them . The whips and whimpers , the glistening boots , the macho marching songs , the sado-chic - my dear , the divine decadence . It 's all so terribly cinematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just a Gigolo lights it in elegant chiaroscuro and populates it with every species of eccentric known to Weimar Berlin . Marlene Dietrich ( her first film since 1964 ) intones the title song . David Bowie makes love to Kim Novak in a cemetery . David Hemmings ( who also directed ) plays a Nazi who turns Bowie 's corpse into Horst Wessel . The stars keep straight faces and hold the viewer 's eye through every narrative absurdity , and the film is handsomer , weirder , certainly funnier than Hardly Working . It would be stylish high-camp fun-if only the Nazis had n't existed .
