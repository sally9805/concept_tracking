That is , I believe , also the name of a navigational instrument , is it not ? " As usual , the physicist is correct : the acronym for long-range navigation also describes the hero of Chaim Potok 's fifth and most ambitious novel . Although the author has retained a strong narrative drive , he has abandoned the matzo-barrel homilies that marked such early works as The Chosen and The Promise . Once again his themes are ethnic , but his concerns are universal . <P> Orphaned in the late ' 30s , when his parents were killed in a now forgotten Arab-Israeli battle , Gershon Loran is raised by an uncle in a Brooklyn ghetto . Surrounded by squalor , the teen-ager refuses to succumb to despair . One summer night , he watches a mongrel bitch give birth to a litter of puppies . In a sudden rush of insight , resting on the roof of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt all caught up in the life of heaven and earth , in the mystery of creation , in the pain and inexhaustible glory of this single moment . " The Book of Lights charts Loran 's search to re-create that epiphany . <P> In college and later the seminary , Loran retreats from humanity , abandoning the generous philosophy of the Talmud for the magical pronouncements of the Kabbalah . A fellow student wonders : " Do you transform yourself in the night ? Do you become a Rabbi Hyde ?

" <P> Certainly they are not focused on her , or on his roommate Arthur Leiden , one of Potok 's most complex and compelling characters . Leiden 's father was a parent of the atomic bomb . The son 's heritage is a lifelong nightmare of incinerated birds in his Los Alamos backyard . But if Leiden Jr . is damned at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family to aid Gershon with a scholarship ; later Leiden prevails upon " Uncle Albert " Einstein to make the journey from Princeton to the graduation . The favors are not returned ; Loran is too busy probing his own psyche . <P> He has plenty of company . In ' 50s America , the Holocaust is not yet an obsession . <P> Instead , Topic A in synagogues and cafeterias is the sins committed by Jews . The elder Leiden reflects , " We tinker with light and atomic bombs ... No one is on more familiar terms with the heart of the insanity in the universe than is the Jew , and no one is more frenetic and untidy in the search for an answer ... We offer apocalypses in a pushcart. "
