Carter barnstorms the nation to boost his campaign <P> " Carter ! " they chanted " Carter ! Carter ! Carter ! " For a moment at least , the President last week heard Americans cheer themselves hoarse , a heady sensation he had not enjoyed in many months . Knowing all too well how desperately he needed a lift , Jimmy Carter had chosen his audience well : the convention in Los Angeles of the National Education Association . The organization has been enthusiastically behind him ever since he supported higher aid to education and fought successfully for the establishment of a separate Department of Education . <P> Carter 's ego-boosting appearance before the N.E.A. was the highlight of a frantic week of sputtering presidential fireworks , or possibly distress signals , as he tried to generate momentum for his campaign . Though he had just returned from a moderately upbeat trip to Europe , Carter took off on another 15-day marathon that would wing him twice across the U.S. , then to Japan , then to a stopover in Alaska on the way back and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coast of Georgia , where he would watch the Republican Convention on TV . <P> In the friendly confines of the N.E.A. convention , Carter launched his most serious and bitter attack yet on the policies of Ronald Reagan , the all-but-crowned nominee of the G.O.P. The President denounced the Kemp-Roth tax cut , which Reagan supports , as " sheer deception . . . the kind of hasty offer that can only be called by one word , and that is ' irresponsible . ' " Concluded Carter : " It is a classic offer in a political year of a free lunch , something for nothing . The American people know there is nothing for nothing any longer .

Doffing his jacket , Carter traded repartee with an audience in the farm community of Merced . When a farmer complained about immigrants ' not wanting to work , Carter cracked , without further explanation , " There are loafers even in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostages in Iran by mentioning still another " avenue to Iranian leaders . " But then he admitted , " I do not know what else we can do without endangering the lives of the hostages . " <P> On the evening of July 4 , the President flew to Miami Beach to address the N.A.A.C.P. convention . The black vote was basic to his victory four years ago , and he needs it even more urgently this year . The problem is ' not that blacks will desert to Carter 's rivals . Reagan 's conservative positions turn them off , and John Anderson remains an unknown , although he displayed engaging candor when he told the N.A.A.C.P. convention : " I can not pretend to know what it is day in and day out to be black in America . " The threat to Carter is that blacks may be so disappointed with his performance that they may not vote in large enough numbers to help him take key states that he captured in 1976.               @ @ @ @ @ @
