THE NEW REPUBLIC DECEMBER 14 , 1987 THE BOOK ON IRANAMOK It 's understandable how Republican backbenchers in the House can come to view politics as a form of warfare . Takeno-prisoners rhetoric , automatic polarization of opinion , and the tendency to view as enemies all those who are not ideological brothers ? these are the characteristics of an oppressed minority within a minority , which derives its comfort from a sense of purity . It 's understandable too how a president might welcome a hyperpartisan on the White House staff ? a Pat Buchanan , for instance ? to keep beacon fires alight and prevent pragmatists and deal-makers from turning an administration 's original principles to mush . But for a major area of government policy-making responsibility to be taken over by zealots , political road warriors , and geopolitical paranoids is profoundly dangerous to the country . It was officials of just such mentality who led the Reagan administration into the Iranamok scandal . Fortunately , they were caught and stopped before doing permanent damage to anything other than the administration 's own credibility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report of Congress 's Iran-contra investigating committees . " President Reagan and his staff made mistakes , " the eight conservative Republicans acknowledge in their statement , but " there was no constitutional crisis , no systematic disrespect for ' the rule of law , ' no grand conspiracy , and no administration-wide dishonesty or cover-up . " On television , various authors of the minority report pronounced the majority 's findings to be " hysterical , " and the minority document claims that " a great deal " of the majority report is " overdrawn , speculative , and built on a selective use of the committees ' documentary materials , " not to mention partisan . One minority contributor , Representative Henry Hyde , declared the committees ' work " a witch-hunt . " In fact , this was a hunt that produced real witches . As the majority declared in its summary , " The common ingredients on the Iran and contra policies were secrecy , deception , and disdain for law . A small group of senior officials believed that they alone knew what was right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government as a threat to their objectives . They told neither the secretary of state nor the American people of their actions . When exposure was threatened , they destroyed officialdocuments and lied to Cabinet officials , to the public , and to elected representatives in Congress . They testified that they even withheld key facts from the president . " If there was no constitutional crisis in Iranamok , there certainly was a threat to constitutional process . Lt. Col. Oliver North testified that CIA Director William Casey hoped to develop an " off the shelf " covert action capability that would have conducted secret operations without oversight from Congress and even , perhaps , without the knowledge of the president . The minority report asserts there is no evidence that Casey 's hope was ever realized . Actually the Iranamok goings-on ? the Iran arms sale , the diversion of some funds for use by the contras , and the holding back of some money for hostage-ransoming in Lebanon or for future activities ? constituted the beginning of just such a system . It 's a safe bet that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper in Beirut , not by the ostensibly adversarial American media ? North would have found any number of covert projects to carry out around the world and might have created his very own bureaucracy inside the National Security Council . Contrary to the minority 's assertion , there was a systematic disrespect for the law evidenced in White House behavior . Under Section 501 of the National Security Act , the executive branch is required to report " significant anticipated intelligence activity " to Congress . It did not report the sale of arms to Iran . We think it is clear beyond all doubt that , in giving money , intelligence , and military direction to the contras , the administration violated the series of laws known together as the Boland amendment , restricting American government support for the Nicaraguan resistance . At the very least , the administration found an arguable loophole in the law and then lied about what it was doing so that Congress would n't have the opportunity to clarify its intentions . Even that ? the case of the administration 's defenders ? is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of law . " And once the Iran story began to become public , the administration did engage in a massive attempt to cover up . President Reagan at first refused comment , claiming hostages ' lives were at stake . When he did speak , he said reports about the arms sales had " no foundation . " Later , he admitted some arms had been transferred ? but less than would fill the cargo hold of a transport plane , and only to develop contact with potential moderates in Iran . It was " utterly false , " he said , that the arms were being traded for hostages . Yet all the evidence suggests that getting hostages released was always the president 's primary motivation . What can one call the shredding of incriminating documents , the rewriting of chronologies , and the preparing of false statements , except a cover-up ? The congressional majority rightly singles out Attorney General Edwin Meese for special condemnation ? especially for his failure to conduct a systematic and arms-length investigation of the scandal , and for allowing destruction of evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Reagan committed impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors . But there is overwhelming evidence to supportthe majority 's charge of negligence toward his sworn duty to " take care that the laws be faithfully executed . " Despite his own professed optimism about America 's fundamental strength , Reagan put officials in charge of U.S. policy who distrusted its constitutional processes and its ability to confront adversaries while observing the law . Despite his vaunted skills as a communicator , he abandoned his responsibility to persuade the public and Congress to follow his controversial Central America policy , and proceeded covertly instead . When he got caught , he lied and let others lie . Reagan has suffered deservedly for these monumental " mistakes . " He has lost the country 's trust for his last two years of office . If he were now to subvert the legal process by pardoning potential criminal defendants , he would be doing more than that . He would be risking a permanent blight on his entire presidency .                @ @ @ @ @
