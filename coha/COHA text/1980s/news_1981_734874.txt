txt Q  --  After a recent visit to Brookfield Zoo with my kids , I dragged out a bunch of photos of an earlier trip to the zoo to show them what I considered to be a real showman , Ziggy the elephant . They were suitably impressed with my story and the pictures , but stumped me with their question about Ziggy 's broken tusks . Can you tell us how it happened ? D. Klein , Itasca A  --  A photo of Ziggy taken in 1966 shows the 10-foot-tall 6-ton Indian bull elephant with both tusks relatively intact . The curved tusks , about six feet long , crossed each other in front . About a foot of his right tusk was missing in a 1969 photo . It 's hard to pinpoint the cause because Ziggy was still in solitary confinement and had been since 1941 . When he won a reprieve and a new $50,000 home , Ziggy emerged from confinement in 1971 with half his left tuck missing . Then came that day in March , 1975 , when the senile pachyderm took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his right tusk and some skin as a result . He had already lost most of his appetite and some of his aggressiveness before that accident , and it was only a matter of time . On Oct. 27 , 1975 , Ziggy sat down , rolled over on his side , and breathed his last . He was about 55 years old . Ziggy after his fall into the moat in 1975 . Q  --  Can Action Line help ? I am a senior citizen planning to work part-time at the Field Museum of Natural History . The problem is that the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad says the only way I can obtain the senior citizen half fare is to buy a one-way ticket . You cant buy two or more , or any other type of ticket . Do I have to ride all the way to Randolph Street and present it to the agent for the refund ? How would I , get back to Roosevelt Road  --  walk ? How does this work going home ? J.D. Taylor , Dolton A  --  Lois Langer , public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State St. , said : " You . are not alone in your problem , and the ICG , to make up for an absence of ticket agents at many of its stations , has established an alternate method for refunding reduced fares . The ICG will accept by mail proof of ticket purchase and make refunds . To find out what procedure.you should follow , use the orange phone found in any ICG station . This phone is a direct line to the ICG main office , and a staff member can answer all your questions . re . garding ticket refunds . " However , soon this may not be a problem , Langer added , because the RTA is working toward a senior citizen monthly reduced fare pass that will be honored on all ETA-funded rail carriers . " Even closer to implementation , " Langer said , " is an interchangeable senior citizens reduced fare pass for the CTA and suburban bus lines . " Watch for an announcement from the RTA of these " special users travel benefits . " Q  --  Someone told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been misled . My son was admitted to the hospital on Dec. 23. 1977 , and spent six weeks there before coming home the second week in February , 1978 . The insurance company took their SIO0 deductible for 1977 and S100 more for 1978 . I feel 8100 was too much for ' 77 for only one week . In the Blue Cross book I read that " the portion of your individual S100 deductible met in the last three months of the calendar year will be counted toward your 5100 deductible of the next year . " My husband went to the Blue Cross office . He was told we should receive S80 back . A few days later I received a phone call , but I did not understand what was explained to me . Will you please try to find out for me ? Martha Hawkins , Calumet City A  --  The separate $100 deductible for 1978 was taken in error , Blue Cross-Blue Shield 's special inquiries spokesman told us . You have now received $80 , which is 80 per cent of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years I 'm convinced that the pharmaceutical firms and the doctors who write the prescrip- tions really do not want a " cure " found for any diseases . After all , we 're their " . bread and butter . " What do they really care if we have a life of pain and have to stay put most of the time , to say nothing of the hardships of our families ? Just so we make it into their offices regularly and they collect their fees . One drug I take every day goes up in price every time it 's refined . Now it 's up to $38 a month . The , next " miracle " drug will , of course , be higher . But a real cure ? Not on your lifer Longtime reader , Chicago ? - ?
