Gurgle , gurgle , the budget is sinking <P> When they first saw the budget , Congressmen of both parties let out a bipartisan howl . Then they quieted down to plot strategy and develop proposals of their own . By last week trial balloons containing alternative budget plans were floating above Capitol Hill . For President Reagan , the question had become when , not whether , he would join the budget bargaining . " If you want to present a comprehensive proposal , " he told G.O.P. leaders , " then we 'll be happy to talk . " <P> Any remaining chance that Reagan 's 1983 budget would be passed intact was lost at midweek when Republican Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico , one of the Administration 's key budget operatives in Congress , declared his opposition . Said Domenici : " Political leaders do all a disservice by pretending that we can swallow $100 billion-plus deficits as though they were aspirin tablets . " Offering his own remedy for the deficit headache , he proposed trimming defense spending by limiting its growth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the next three years . His plan also called for freezing the costs of all domestic programs at 1982 levels through 1985 , thus saving another $34 billion . He suggested eliminating pay raises for federal employees in 1983 and keeping raises over the next two years to 5% , for a reduction of $25 billion . Cost of living increases in 1983 in all entitlement programs , including Social Security , would be scrapped , knocking off another $60 billion by 1985 . To raise revenues , Domenici recommended closing a string of tax loopholes , a move that would net a total of $122 billion by 1985 . <P> Using deficit predictions higher than the ones offered by the President , the Senator estimated that his plan would slash $320 billion from the budget over the next three years . Though Domenici 's proposal would still yield a $90 billion deficit in 1983 , just a shade less than Reagan 's plan , the shortfall in 1984 would be $65 billion and in 1985 , $55 billion . The Administration 's proposal , by contrast , allows for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1985 . Even those figures seem exceedingly optimistic . The Congressional Budget Office expects the 1983 deficit to be $120.6 billion , climbing to $128.9 billion in 1984 and $139.6 billion in 1985 . <P> The Democrats , at least , were delighted . " We are fishing in the same waters , " said Senator Ernest Hollings of South Carolina , the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee , who three weeks ago proposed a somewhat more drastic freeze on federal spending . Added Congressman James Jones of Oklahoma , who heads the House Budget Committee : " Many of the elements are very close to what I 've been saying have to be part of a compromise . " Though White House aides found fault with the plan for its meager defense hikes and its politically explosive cuts in Social Security benefits , they were careful not to reject it outright . Domenici has made " a good-faith effort to come up with an alternative , " said one presidential adviser . " We 'll take a look at it . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
