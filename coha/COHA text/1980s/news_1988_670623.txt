On March 8 , the frenetic day of caucuses and primaries that politicians have dubbed Super Tuesday , much will depend on how the various campaigns have solved this puzzle , which forces them to create regional and even local advertising strategies. // The effort has been going on for weeks and has some elements of a spy thriller . <> <> A Rare Kind of Poker // The campaigns have been buying air time as clandestinely as possible , hoping to mask their great game , while using contacts in the television industry to uncover rivals ' strategies. // Meanwhile , the television stations in the Super Tuesday markets and the agents who represent them have been trying to play one campaign off against another . By leaking word to one campaign that a rival is buying time in a particular market , the agents can frequently increase advertising sales and nudge rates upward. // " It ' s like a high-stakes poker game in which every player is covering up his hand as best he can but is sitting with a mirror directly behind him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Republican campaign of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas. // As a result , the process is less secret than campaign strategists might like . <> <> Thousands of Outletsa // On March 8 , primaries or caucuses will be held in 20 states and one territory , from Rhode Island to American Samoa , more jurisdictions than have ever held such contests in one day . Since it is impossible for a candidate to spend much time campaigning in more than a few of these places , paid advertising will be especially critical to the outcome. // More than 500 television stations and thousands of radio stations are situated in the Super Tuesday states , and experts say that even a moderate advertising campaign across the range of these broadcast outlets would cost at least $2 million . Saturation advertising of the kind that the candidates favored for the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary would cost three or four times more. // The cost of even a moderate campaign is clearly out of reach for all but a few candidates , which makes strategic selection all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tantalizing part of the tactics of this campaign is the analysis of the Super Tuesday chessboard , " said Fred Martin , campaign manager for Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee , a candidate who has made Super Tuesday his strategic cornerstone . <> <> Information Flows From Rivals // Although some candidates , including Mr. Gore , Representative Richard A. Gephardt and Vice President Bush , have already gone on the air with Super Tuesday advertising , most campaigns will not discuss their strategies . Mr. Martin would not even say where he had already advertised , much less where Mr. Gore ' s commercials might appear next week. // But campaign aides are willing to discuss their opponents ' plans. // Mr. Gore ' s foes say his campaign has bought television time in Texas , Mississippi , Kentucky , Arkansas , Virginia , Georgia , North Carolina and South Carolina. // Gov . Michael S. Dukakis of Massachussetts , according to his rivals , is making substantial purchases in Florida , Texas , Baltimore and Atlanta. // Mr. Gephardt , his opponents say , is shopping in Oklahoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <> <> A Half-Hour With Bob Dole // Among the Republicans , Mr. Dole ' s campaign has reportedly bought blanket coverage of Missouri , including a half-hour show in prime time in St. Louis , as well as time in Oklahoma and North Carolina . The Dole campaign is said to be eschewing advertising in Texas , where Mr. Bush is considered to have a strong lead. // Mr. Bush , according to his foes , has bought time in both Carolinas , Oklahoma , Missouri , Texas and Atlanta. // Representative Jack F. Kemp of New York and Pat Robertson , both seeking the support of the Republican right wing , are said to be competing for the airwaves in South Carolina , whose primary on Saturday , March 5 , sets the stage for Super Tuesday itself . Mr. Robertson is also reported to have bought time in Florida and a half-hour program in Columbia , Mo . <> <> Computers a Necessity // The Super Tuesday advertising campaign requires extensive computer resources . Catherine Farrell , who buys advertising time for Mr. Bush , said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using a large computer that can spit out ratings , estimated prices and time availability for all Super Tuesday markets in about three minutes. // Part of the strategy is obvious : if a candidate appears to have a given area wrapped up , his competitors will probably not want to spend their scarce resources there. // Another factor , apart from simple financial constraints , is efficiency . " There ' s great value in being able to find stations that overlap into two or three Congressional districts " or even into two or three states , said David Doak , a consultant to Mr. Gephardt . <> <> Low Rates - If // Advertising time is generally bought through companies , the largest of them in New York , Philadelphia and Washington , that represent hundreds of stations . Efforts to buy time regionally have not worked , so ad tapes , contracts and checks must be mailed individually to each station. // Under Federal regulations , a television station must offer a candidate the lowest rate that is generally made available for the time period he wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these rates are " pre-emptable , " meaning that anyone who offers more can knock the commercial off the air . Campaigns complain that stations sometimes use this threat to drive up prices. // " Any campaign that tries to run on the lowest available rate is not going to be on the air , " said Mr. Fabrizio , the purchaser of air time for Mr. Dole. // Campaign aides say it is important to know what other organizations are doing in advance , because quick reponses later will be increasingly difficult as the time before March 8 becomes short . Forearmed , a campaign may be able to step into a district where a rival is not advertising and pick up a few delegates . Or it may find that it has to compete with another candidate ' s advertising somewhere. // This intelligence is especially critical when a campaign contemplates negative advertising . " It probably makes sense to go negative only where the candidate you are after is on the air , " said a campaign consultant . " There ' s no sense informing voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they may have only the barest knowledge of him. " // Stations keep public records of completed political advertising contracts , but the information also can be had in advance. // " I ' m sure some people at the stations are giving out information on buys , to give other campaigns a little nudge to spend more money , " said Jeff Jones , sales manager for the political division of Katz Communications , one of the nation ' s top sales companies . " People do it in our branch of the industry too. " // Strategic considerations aside , there is some gamesmanship behind the penchant for secrecy. // " We could just have an open forum where we all trade information , " said Mr. Martin , of the Gore campaign . " But that would take a lot of the fun out of it. " //
