THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ELEVISION anchormen , act ing more like balloons than like anchors , have lately been floating all over the world . In the past couple of weeks , Dan Rather , of CBS , dressed in an L. L. Bean-type jacket , popped up on a farm in South Texas , to tell us about the arm crisis ; Tom Brokaw , of NBC , was in Washington , to cover the investigation of the loss of the space shuttle Challenger ; Peter Jennings , of ABC , was in Moscow , for the twenty-seventh Congress of the Soviet Communist Party ; and Ted Koppel , of ABC , was in Manila , to cover the change of government in the Philippines . It 's always exciting when television programs originate live from other countries . Live coverage from distant places somehow confirms their existence  --  and the existence of the people who live there  --  in a way that mere coverage of those places does not . The countries brought to us by the two ABC men turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where " people power " had been unleashed , we saw crowds flowing through the streets , making history directly , with their own voices , their own bodies , their own hands . Action was individual , nonviolent , spontaneous , and chaotic , yet it all tended toward a goal that was achieved with stunning swiftness and near-magical efficiency  --  the downfall of President Ferdinand Marcos and his dictatorship , and the rise of Presi  --  dent Corazon Aquino and democracy . In the Soviet Union , we saw an oppo  --  site spectacle , expressive of a complete  --  ly different sort of power  --  the serried rows of delegates to the Congress lis  --  tening to their leaders ' speeches , there only to compose a scene , like paint on a canvas . Their voices were dumb , their bodies were in use only to fill chairs , their hands only to applaud . As it happens , when President Marcos , by engaging in extensive fraud , " won " the Philippine election , the Soviet Union congratulated him on his supposed victory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in doing so . After Marcos fell , a Soviet spokesman said that its recogni  --  tion of Mrs. Aquino 's government was " automatic , " and added sourly that Marcos 's fall showed that it was " dan  --  gerous to be a friend of the United States . " ( The Poles must wish that the Soviet Union would prove similarly " dangerous " in its support of their un  --  popular dictator . ) Our most important friends in the Philippines , however , were not the country 's leaders but its people , to whom , as it turned out , we were faithful . ( It was an allegiance , it 's true , that we had discovered only recently , and that we have not yet of  --  fered to the peoples of South Korea and Chile , among others . ) The So  --  viets ' mistake , it seems safe to bet , was an error of the mind  --  of cold calcula  --  tion  --  and not of the heart ; noting that the dictator had been cut adrift from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oppor  --  tunity to pick up some polit  --  ical loose change . The forces at work in the Philip  --  pine revolution were demo  --  cratic and nonviolent , and in Soviet thinking these apparently did not qualify as possible determinants of real events . The Soviets looked at the mul  --  titudes in the streets , with their rosaries and their flowers , and were not im  --  pressed . They looked at the strong man in his lavish palace , issuing orders to his far-flung military and police forces , and extended their congratulations . ? N the Soviet Communist Party Congress , General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev gave a speech that lasted for five and a half hours , as if he hoped that the vigor and loqua  --  ciousness of one person could compen  --  sate for the passivity and silence of the delegates . By all reports , he finds that Soviet society suffers from stagnation , and he was apparently seeking to lash his people to new efforts . When he was done , others spoke , more briefly . ( In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , the longer you get to talk . Gus Hall , the general sec  --  retary of the Communist Party U.S.A. ? membership twenty thousand  --  had originally been allotted ten minutes and was required to cut that to five . ) Among the speakers was the head of the Soviet Motion Picture Workers Union , Mr. Lev A. Kulidzhanov . For him , five and a half hours of listening to General Secretary Gorbachev had not been enough . " I wo n't repeat what has been said here about the political report that Mikhail Sergeyevich Gor  --  bachev made , " he said , according to a story in the Times . " I wholeheartedly agree with his profound analysis . When Mikhail Sergeyevich finished and stepped from the podium , I felt involun  --  tary regret , if I may say so , that he had finished . Thank you , Mikhail Sergeyevich , for your brilliant lesson . " At this point Gorbachev him  --  self intervened , saying , " Let 's stop declining Mikhail Sergeyevich " ? a reference to the many declensions his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Upon hearing this rebuke , Kulidzhanov , undeflected from sycophancy , replied , " This is a lesson we must all learn . " That comical scene brings to mind another , reported by Aleksandr Sol  --  zhenitsyn in " The Gulag Archipel  --  ago . " At a district Party conference in the nineteen-twenties in a Mos  --  cow province whose District Party Committee Secretary had just been ar rested and replaced by a new man , a tribute to Stalin was called for , and all present rose and began to applaud . They began , but they could not stop , for to be the first to stop might demon  --  strate to the N.K.V.D. men in the hack of the room a suspect lack of zeal , and lead to arrest . Solzhenitsyn writes : And in that obscure , small hall , un  --  known to the Leader , the applause went on  --  six , seven , eight minutes ! They were done for ! Their goose was cooked ! They could n't stop now till they collapsed with heart attacks .... Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper factory as  --  sumed a businesslike expression and sat down in his seat . And , oh , a miracle took place ! Where had the universal , uninhibit  --  ed , indescribable enthusiasm gone ? To a man everyone else stopped dead and sat down . They had been saved ! The squirrel had been smart enough to jump off his revoking wheel . That night , the director of the paper factory was arrested . The differ  --  ence between the scene of the nine  --  teen-twenties , in which one brave man risked his life to rescue his col  --  leagues from a sentence of eternal ap  --  plause for the leader , and the scene of the nineteen-eighties , in which the leader personally stepped in to halt the adulation , reflects a heartening change in the Soviet Union , yet the two stories belong to the same political universe . In no country are the people more of  --  ten invoked as the source of power than in the Soviet Union , but in no country do the people share less in the business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership would like to release , within certain limits , the ener  --  gies of the people , but it appears that the only means they can think of for doing so is more orders from the top , of the paradoxical kind that Gorba  --  chev gave to Kulidzhanov at the Party Congress : " Stop listening so slavishly to our five-hour speeches , " " Criticize us , or else , " " You over there , loosen up . " It seems to be what happens when you try to unleash people power with  --  out unleashing the people . ? Medicine Robes and Black Cowboys THE Museum of the American Indian is at Broadway and 155th Street , but it would rather not he . " We feel that the average museumgoer just does n't want to make the long trek up here , " Elizabeth Beim , the museum 's public-affairs officer , told us at a party at the museum a while ago . " Also , the average museumgoer may be a bit un ? willing to come to a neighborhood that he perceives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun shines into the storefronts just uptown from the museum . People from the stores sweep the sidewalks in front . Other people stand on the corners and talk in Spanish . One store sells religious stat  --  uary , and smooth stones that are sup  --  posed to protect against being struck by lightning . Once in a while , groups of kids run through the 157th Street I.R.T. station with short sticks , drum  --  ming on every surface they can reach , including the token booth . The party  --  white wine , mixed nuts , rented coatrack  --  was for the opening of a new exhibit , called " I Need No Blanket : Hide Robes of the Great Plains . " The museum 's di  --  rector , Roland W. Force , was there , and he shook many hands , threw his arm around many shoulders , and warmly clasped many collarbones . Once , while he was saying goodbye to two people he held another man he wanted to talk to by the forearm , so as not to lose him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American art and arti  --  facts in the world , " Elizabeth Beim said . " We feel that it deserves a better home . We feel that it deserves to be on the Mall with the Smithsonian and the Air and Space Museum in Washing  --  ton . You know , of course , about the museum 's recent search for a new home . You know that last year , when the Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot heard we wanted to move , he offered to contribute seventy million dollars toward a new museum facility and li  --  brary if we would agree to go to Dal  --  las . You know that when the powers that be in New York heard about that , the whole issue really became a polit  --  ical football . . . " In one corner of the exhibition room , a TV screen set in the wall was showing a tape about the Indian art of decorating garments with porcupine quills . Indian women were washing the quills in Tide detergent in plastic basins set on sheets of newspapers fea  --  turing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wore a dress of copper-colored imita  --  tion suede . " Almost all these robes come from the tribes of the northern Plains , " she told us . " The Crow , the Lakota Sioux , the Mandan , the Chey  --  enne , the Blood , the Blackfeet . About half the hides in our collection have the hair on and half do n't , so I 'm guessing that one kind was for winter wear and the other for summer . They 're painted with lignite , and sizing made from boiled hooves , and watercolors , and ink , and Chinese dye . Some of the characters on this paper packet of Chinese vermillion say some  --  thing like ' Made by the very good ex  --  cellent paint company . ' And there 's a character that means that the powder was pounded tip and down , and one that means that it was ground in a cir  --  cular motion . It was an Indian-trade item on the Plains , and this particular packet might date from before 1850 . Most of the hides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love-medicine robe . The elk was associated by the Crow In  --  dian with love and courtship , maybe be  --  cause elk are very demonstrative when they make love . The robe was painted by a Crow Indian named Fog , and the decoration was based on a vision he had . The robe was supposed to help him get the girl he loved , and the story is that it worked so well he later lent it to other men to use . Elk teeth were sweet  --  heart gifts , like pearls . This dress has elk teeth sewn all over the front , and it 's quite subtly spectacular . " The words " Marsden Hartley ? Not bloody likely , my dear ! " jumped all at once from the general party noise , like a fist from a cartoon fistfight . " I spent hours pinning these hides up for display , " Lee Callander said . " And since then I 've found that you have to check on them every day . It 's as if they were still alive . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's what makes them secret  --  ly charming to me . This love-medi  --  cine robe , with the male and female elk and the red lightning  --  I thought I had it pinned perfectly . Then , this morning , one corner just went mmpsl and drooped down . Tomorrow , I 'll pin it down there . I 'm just trying to pin them where they want to be . " ? MORE recently , we went up to the art gallery in the Adam Clayton Powell , Jr. , State Office Building , on 125th Street , to watch a triple feature n THE NEW/ YORIEK of Westerns . The Museum of African American His  --  tory and Arts ( which has no exhibition space at all at the moment and is raising money for the purpose ) showed the movies as part of its black-film festival during national Black His  --  tory Month . The first movie , " Two-Gun Man from Harlem , " and the second one , " Harlem Rides the Range , " were made in the thirties and had all-black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsely accused of a murder , goes to Harlem , and comes back to the West disguised as a preacher : " I preach the gospel , brother  --  gun gos  --  pel . " Every few minutes , galloping horse hooves helped the action with their satisfying headlong sound . In the second movie , the hero saves a miner and his daughter bothered by claim jumpers . ( " Father , what are you doing under the floor ? " " Why , that 's where my radium mine is located . " ) In the first movie , the villain was named Mr. Barker , and his stooge was named Butch Carter . In the second , the villain was named Mr. Bradley , and his stooge was named Jim Connors . In both movies , the hero was named Bob Blake . When Bob Blake was not in disguise , he wore a white hat . Both movies fea  --  tured the actor Spencer Williams , who became Andy in the " Amos ' n ' Andy " television series . The third movie , " Buffalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Southwest , was made in 1971 and had opinions about the war in Viet  --  nam . While the projector cooled down between films , Kwasi-Judge B. Davis , the president of the Bill Pickett Memorial Rodeo/Riding Association , gave a speech about black cowboys ; he said that during the great trail drives of the last century maybe as many as five thousand black cowboys rode with the herds . Then a rodeo cowboy from the Bronx named Mulzim Fida'i , wearing a red bandanna , a blue plaid shirt , a beige jacket , and a gray Stetson with a Tom Mix crease , came up to the microphone and hunkered over it like a man talking to a child . " You know , one reason they called ' em cow boys is because a lot of ' em were boys , ' " he said . " I mean boys in the old sense , back in the days when folks like you and me would be called boys and girls our whole lives . The black cowboy had a set of skills that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was black cowboys all through the whole spectrum of the cattle business in the old West , because they had the natural affinity between man and horse that is a special quality among black people . So , just remem  --  ber , when you see Gene Autry and Roy Rogers and Hopalong Cassidy and John Wayne playing cowboy , what they 're playing is us . " Later , we asked liIulzim Fida'i which rodeo event he specialized in , " I was a steer wrestler , " he said . " I say was ' because I messed up both my knees . My right one , I tore some carti  --  lage when a steer I had down flipped back up on me , and the left one , ironi  --  cally  --  it 's strange  --  I injured riding a bicycle on the way to the stable . So what Pm more into now is giving lessons in horsemanship to the young people , trying to stop the cycle of vic  --  timizing and being victimized that 's going on out on the streets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nation to succeed that 's part of what being a cowboy is all about . You do n't find these types of values in urban areas . I was born in the Bronx , and when I was a kid all I wanted to be was a cowboy . I had the hat , six-ems , boots . Remember that Bonomo 's Tur  --  kish Taffy ? I used to bite that off and chew it and spit like it was tobacco . Kids used to think I was weird , man . I watched all the cowboys on TV and in the movies , but Johnny Mack Brown was the one that appealed to me . He was nice , kind , he had a beautiful buckskin horse . Well , one day Johnny Mack Brown , he came to my elemen  --  tary school in the Bronx . We stood in a line to meet him , and he came down the line , and when he got to me he stopped and patted my head and said , Hey , how you doin ' ? ' Wow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School in 1963 , and the next year I joined the Marines , and I was in the Marines for four years and seven days . I served in Vietnam in the Da Nang area  --  Chu Lai , Phu Bai , Flue  --  and I was one of the lucky ones : I came back sane , or semi-sane . The Marines was O.K. ? actually , I loved the life  --  but I was n't really geared to handle the covert racism that was going on , the Confederate flags all over the place . In Vietnam , there was people who let you know they was fighting you and the enemy at the same time . I got out in ' 68 and started working as a samples clerk at Scalamandre Silks , and then , through the V.A . and the Urban League , I entered a joint apprentice  --  ship program they were starting , with the idea of breaking us into the con  --  struction unions . First thing I did was look at a list of salaries for different jobs , and I picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's high-steel construction . People think only Mohawk Indians do that , but we do it , too . As a matter of fact , I put up the steel in this building . Let 's see , that was ? When 'd we get mar  --  ried ? This is my wife , Emily . Come here and say hello to the man . She 's shy . 1970 ? So I was working on this building the year before , in ' 69 . About that time , I really started riding con  --  sciously . I used to go to BJ 's Stable , on Pelham Parkway , and when I had a little money I bought one of their hack horses that was too big for most people to handle . He was a palomino quarter horse named Chisolm 's Trail , and I used to ride him in parades , just up and down streets , everywhere . People like to talk to a man on a horse . My horse got crippled , and 1 had to put him down last year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like losing a brother . When I went around to rodeos in the New York area , people used to tell me I should steer-wrestle , because I had the size , so finally , at a rodeo in Coney Island , I entered the steer wrestling , and I could n't believe it  --  I won . My time was six point one seconds . I re  --  member throwing that steer seemed like it took a lifetime . What I 'm inter  --  ested in doing right now is starting a rodeo school in Westchester County with Charlie Reno Hall , the famous black rodeo cowboy from New Jersey . That idea is still in the development stage . I 'd like to take a team of New York cowboys to rodeos all around the country . I believe it 's very important that our children see us doing things they think only other people can do . I 'm also a volunteer working with kids in the Youth at Risk program , spon  --  sored by the Breakthrough Founda  --  tion , which was started by Werner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the guy who founded est . I do n't care about money  --  I want to help make a positive difference in people 's lives . I want to help some of these kids appreciate the wonderful experience of being alive . " Spirit CHRISTINA Cox is Ms. Liberty , the living symbol of the Lady with the Torch , not because she won some pageant or wrote the best essay or mailed in the most tops of something so bad that its makers have to resort to contests to maintain a market share . She just named herself Ms. Liberty , and made herself a sash embroidered with the title , and went around gath  --  ering support . Ms. Cox , a beautiful actress , has already arranged to meet Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden , and City Council President Andrew Stein ; and as soon as the Queens thing is cleared up they 'll back her there almost for sure . The Amer  --  ican Flag Institute has lent its support , as has the Cinderella Flower Com  --  pany , which supplied trimmings for her crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meirs Shoe Company , who donated five pairs of expensive shoes , and Mr. Bruck , of Jewelry 57 , who has designed for Ben Gazzara and Gladys Knight , and who made a gold charm depicting Liberty 's face for Ms. Cox . Also , Shelley Bern  --  stein , of Roxanne Swimsuits , has been helpful . According to Richard Roff  --  man , Ms. Cox 's public-relations man , Mr. Bernstein 's company " takes pains in making a comfortable fit especially for shapely women  --  and donated three suits for Ms. Cox 's 36/24/36 figure . " Mr. Roffman added , " Mr. Bernstein commented that Ms. Liberty should be fresh , clean , and All-Around-Amer  --  ican . " So far , Ms. Cox has been asked to march in the St. Patrick 's Day parade ; she has offered togive a talk over cookies to the Girl Scouts ( an orga  --  nization to which she once belonged ) about the Statue ; and the President of Ecuador has invited her down for a visit . " His brother , Augustin , is a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she told us . Her real goal , though , is to read the poem  --  Emma . Lazarus 's " The New Coles  --  sus " ? at the spectacular that the pro  --  ducer David Wolper is planning for the Fourth of July . The Lady in the Harbor means a good deal to Ms. Cox because her great-grandparents ar  --  rived at Ellis Island from Ireland ( her THE NEW YORKER 33 great-grandfather quickly became the cap  --  tain of the Brooklyn Police Department ) , and because , " from a woman 's point of view , the Statue says a lot about our country . " She told . us , " Being single and liberated , I feel a tremendous responsibili  --  ty to go out and make as much money as I can  --  fifty thousand , sixty thousand dollars , or more . I feel that the pressure is greater on women today than it ever was . My boyfriend is very supportive . He says go out and pursue every dream . He is a fine fellow  --  I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is David Topping , and his father owned the Yankees un  --  til he sold the team to CBS , who then sold it to Steinbrenner . His father was also married to Sonja Henie  --  he was married to six women , and three of them were actresses . And David 's Uncle Bob married Lana Turner . Dating actresses runs in the family , I guess . David owns a bunch of resi  --  dential and commercial buildings in New York , and he has agreed to buy the Gulf Building in Pittsburgh . He has a big Hatteras yacht , and on our first date he sailed me around Long Island in it , and we went right past the Statue . " Though she cares immensely about the Statue , being Ms. Liberty is strict  --  ly volunteer work , and Ms. Cox ca n't entirely neglect her career , which has been moving steadily along . " I played a French maid on ' Benny " she said . " Benny is an extraordinary man , and he taught me a lot about comedy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a mobster 's girlfriend , and I helped rescue Jamie Farr . It turned out to be only a little bit , once they 'd edited it , but it was a great chance to work with great people . And I had my own trailer on the set . I did a Christ  --  mas special called ' Came Upon a Mid  --  night Clear , ' and then last year , at Cannes , I ran into Robin Leach , who wanted to do a ' Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous ' segment about an aspir  --  ing actress , and he chose me . Another thing that 's in the works is a job help  --  ing host a game show , ' Love Me , Love Me Not . ' It 's sort of like ' Dating Game . ' There are two guys and four women . The women tell a story , and the men have to say whether it 's true or not . One woman might say , ' Casa  --  nova was a great lover  --  he made love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure out if she 's lying . If he gets three right answers , he and a woman go out to this big wheel shaped like a daisy , and here it gets more like ' Wheel of Fortune . ' He answers questions , and he has to sort of run around the daisy trying to catch her . And once I start that job I 'll only have to work two days a week , and I 'll be free the rest of the time to be Ms. Liberty . " America is a great country , and Christina Cox is a great lady . And , David Wolper , if you are reading this , you let her read the poem , or you move to some other place , such as Russia .
