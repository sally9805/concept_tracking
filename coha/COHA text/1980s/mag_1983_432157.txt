 | Time was when the Ozarks had an aura of cartoonlike simplicity ? Snuffy Smith characters lazing on muleback along the ridges , full of moonshine in the sunshine . The reality of life in these mountains has surprised the hippies , dropouts and young dreamers who migrated back to the land , wanting to live easy and free . They have found that the simple life is a struggle . The summer that Gary and Louise Bezecny rattled into the Arkansas Ozarks in a battered pickup truck , all they had were a few belongings and $400 cash . By the time November winds knifed through the mountains , they had built a chicken-wire-and-cement igloo , their home for the next three years and the place their first son was born . Unceasing toil . Eight years later , the Bezecnys now live in a two-bedroom cabin put together with their own hands . Last year , their income was $7,000 . Gary is straining to start an herb farm .

" When we were younger , it was an adventure , " she says . " Now , with kids , we have more responsibilities . It 's hard to make a living here . " Most of those who came here in the ' 60s and ' 70s seeking an alternative lifestyle are gone now , defeated by the rocky soil , a subsistence economy and their own city-soft ways . Yet the worn , granite crags with burbling streams , shady hollows and misty vistas still beckon others . Today , tourists and retirees weary of urban ills are flocking to the Ozarks , about 13,000 square miles of ancient mountains that straddle the border of Arkansas and Missouri . Their rapidly growing numbers are causing some fussin ' and feudin ' with the mountain people whose forebears , feeling crowded in their Appalachian homelands , settled here after the Civil War . The back-to-the-landers and environmentalists whose pleas for controlled growth fell on deaf ears five years ago are now seeing politicians and businessmen scramble to preserve the natural assets . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 43 percent of the national average in 1920 to 90 percent today , the newfound wealth has not reached back into some of the hills and hollows . In some of these mountain counties , more than 30 percent of the population lives below the poverty level . Explains Gary Bunch , president of the Bank of Kingston : " We always live in a depression up here . People do n't live above their means . If they have n't got the money , they do n't buy . " Why is the region so poor ? According to Daryl Hobbs , a rural sociologist at the University of Missouri : " It has no particular natural mineral resources , not a high quality of timber , and the agricultural land is marginal . It is rather isolated and did n't have major transportation routes . " In fact , there still are no interstate highways through the region . Folklorist Bill McNeil points out , " The local merchants used to object to paved roads . They figured once the roads were paved , people would go elsewhere to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Bob Purvis , executive director of the Eureka Springs , Ark. , Chamber of Commerce : " You ca n't build factories on the side of a mountain or grow cotton out of rocks . We live on tourism . " Magnet for visitors . What draws people to these hills is their wild beauty . Dating back hundreds of millions of years , compared with tens of millions for the Rockies , the Ozarks are low but sharp-sided mountains and heavily wooded , with cedar and hardwoods on the northern slopes and pine on the south faces . They are heavy with haze on many mornings . Tourism has been a mainstay since the turn of the century , when urbanites fled to the cool mountains and their " medicinal " springs . By the ' 50s , tacky roadside stands pushing tacky souvenirs were in style . Today 's visitor can still buy a plastic statue of Jesus , complete with pencil sharpener , or a wooden outhouse bank . But the strongest current attraction is in arts , crafts and music of the almost extinct mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkansas last year , leaving behind 305 million dollars . The War Eagle Fair alone drew 30,000 shoppers who spent $469,000 in three days last fall snapping up baskets , wood carvings , weaving and needlework . The settlers , once derided as mere " hillbillies , " are now  | admired for their ability to survive and adapt in the sometimes unfriendly environment . " People make a grave mistake if they perceive the hillbilly as dumb , " warns Phil Taylor , director of business research at the University of Arkansas . " He has been , and is , shrewd . He has to be to survive . " In valleys once shunned by industry as too backward , some factories have opened , and agriculture , particularly poultry and cattle raising , is burgeoning . More than 255 million broilers are raised in the area , making poultry production a **25;560;TOOLONG industry . One of the largest cash crops last year , however , was an estimated 60-million-dollar bumper harvest of marijuana , much of it hidden in the hills .

Daisy , a maker of pneumatic rifles and pistols , chose the area to take advantage of favorable tax laws , low energy costs and a loyal labor pool ? " except during deer season , " as Taylor puts it . Since 1960 , about 95,000 new jobs have been created throughout southern Missouri and northern Arkansas . However , Don Young of Ozark Opportunities , Inc. , a private , nonprofit agency specializing in job training and economic development , says : " As far as moving this region into a land of prosperity up here , it will be years and years if it ever happens . The terrain and heritage have something to do with it . We run into third and fourth-generation families who live on the same land and have done the same thing throughout the years . If something is considered a handout or giveaway , they wo n't even talk to you . " E. H. Fowler , 62 , lives on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born .

" When I was a kid , there were more murders than now , " he recalls . " Someone might get huffed up and just kill a guy he was mad at . We used to never worry about anyone stealing anything , except maybe the pigs . This area has changed more in the last 20 years than at any other time I can remember . " That observation is echoed throughout the Ozarks by such as Noah Woods , 57 , who works in a sawmill with his two sons and says : " We set a better table now three times a day than we used to at Christmas . Poor people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yet not everyone is pleased that the seeds of prosperity are being planted by the flood of outsiders . Grouses local columnist Ernie Deane : " I know there is no such thing as no growth in an attractive area , but the attitude here is ' Hell for leather , let 's go , boys . ' Population , industry and some aspects of the economy are growing faster than we can accommodate . " The Ozarks are showing some signs of fatigue . Fourlane highways cut wide swaths through the mountains and valleys where as late as the mid-1950s only gravel roads meandered . Not only is there bumper-to-bumper traffic in such places as Branson , Mo. , and Eureka Springs during the peak tourist season , but canoeists practically paddle over each other jousting down the rippling streams . Water pollution threatens the popular recreation lakes , and the rivers are suffering the effects of too many septic tanks . Crime has increased , and once rural governments are struggling to deal with growing services and diverse interest groups . The National Park Service has bought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as one of the last unspoiled streams in the country . More than 600,000 campers , canoeists and hikers crammed the park last year , causing one native to snipe : " It wo n't be long until you have to stand in line to get on the river . " Midwesterners who have vacationed in the Ozarks are returning as retirees . Thirty-six percent of the population of Baxter County is over the age of 60 . The county is the fastest growing in the state , with a leap of 78 percent in the last decade . One of the largest retirement clubs in Mountain Home is for former employes of Illinois Bell . Mountain Home 's population has quadrupled to 8,000 in the last decade . More than 700 businesses are situated within the city limits , and housing costs have nearly doubled in such subdivisions as Buzzard 's Roost . Mixing old and new . Development has put some strange contrasts upon these old hills . Shiny mobile homes perch next to log cabins . Dish antennas lord over stone fences built generations ago . Solar-heated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the march of winter is noted by the dwindling woodpile . The Bank of Kingston capitalizes on its ornate , turn-of-the-century teller windows , which barely hide up-to-date computers . A Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant has opened less than 2 miles from the Ozark Folk Center in Mountain View , Ark . Further change in the Ozarks seems certain . The fear is that in accommodating what 's called progress , the people will lose the independence and survival skills that set them apart . Jimmy Driftwood , who taught school in Snowball , Ark. , before becoming a country-music star , is one who is working to insure that the folk culture of the Ozarks does not die , spending his weekends hosting jam sessions that feature banjos , fiddles , dulcimers , mouth harps and washtubs . " I do n't want to just preserve it but keep it alive , " says Driftwood . " It 's like peaches . You can cook , preserve and put them on the shelf . But you 've done a sweeter thing if you plant a peach tree . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
