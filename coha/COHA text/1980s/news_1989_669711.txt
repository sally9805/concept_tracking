Her daughter was two years old and her son was six when Representative Schroeder ( D ) of Colorado was first elected in 1972. // One year earlier , Congress had passed the nation ' s first comprehensive child-care bill . But President Richard Nixon vetoed it , and legislators were forced to start over. // // Now Schroeder ' s daughter , Jamie , is a freshman at Princeton and her son , Scott , is a college graduate working for ABC News . But despite the elapsed time and the sustained efforts of Schroeder and other family advocates , no child-care bill has yet become law . Nor has a parental leave bill. // ' ' For 16 years I ' ve been in Congress trying to move these issues on family , ' ' says Schroeder during an interview , a hint of exasperation in her voice . ' ' The only thing that ' s happened is that there ' s more and more stress on families , and more and more people have had to move into the workplace . But the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Families , she explains , have always been ' ' the last order of business ' ' in Washington because they are not associated with power . ' ' Families don ' t have political-action committees , and toddlers don ' t give you honorariums for coming by their day-care centers. ' ' // IN addition , most elected officials are men whose own families are very traditional . As a consequence , they don ' t feel great pressure about child care or parental leave . ' ' To them , those are nice issues , ' ' Schroeder says , ' ' but they ' re not need issues. ' ' // To make presidential candidates confront the family as a ' ' need ' ' issue , Schroeder , briefly a presidential candidate herself , took to the road a year ago with her ' ' Great American Family Tour. ' ' // Now she is on the airport-and-hotel circuit again , this time to talk about her new book , ' ' Champion of the Great American Family ' ' ( New York : Random House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Political Book , ' ' it combines a discussion of family policies here and abroad with Schroeder ' s own experiences as a working parent. // Today Schroeder , who has been re-elected seven times , is the dean of the women serving in Congress . But during her junior years in Washington , as the only congresswoman with small children , she routinely showed up on the House floor with diapers in her handbag . She kept crayons on her office coffee table and hosted preschoolers ' birthday parties in the members ' dining room. // She and her husband , Jim , a lawyer , also learned first-hand the sobering realities of child care , using half a dozen different arrangements - housekeepers , baby sitters , a child care center - during her first year in office. // ' ' Those were very busy and frustrating years , ' ' Schroeder recalls . ' ' One of the problems with being a working mother , whether you ' re a Congresswoman or a stenographer or whatever , is that everybody feels perfectly free to come and tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' re doing to your children is terrible . ' ' I think you should be home . ' They don ' t do that to men. ' ' // BUT the criticism and the juggling gave Schroeder a particular sensitivity to the needs of working parents . She not only became an outspoken supporter of family issues , she sponsored bills on child abuse , pregnancy discrimination , economic protection for former spouses , and part-time employment . Her most recent bill , the Family and Medical Leave Act , is scheduled to reach the House floor around Mother ' s Day ( May 14 ) . // Still , earning a reputation as a champion of the family has not been without its hazards. // ' ' One of the things that hurts me , ' ' Schroeder confesses , ' ' is that every now and then people will say , ' Here comes Pat Schroeder , here comes day care again - that ' s all she ever talks about . ' Then the other side will say , ' She hogs the issue all to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share this issue. ' ' ' // As one way of building a broader base of support , she recently joined with the Child Care Action Campaign to coordinate a national survey on family issues . Results , to be released nationally in early June , will also be sent to the President and Congress . Schroeder hopes that when people ' ' see the magnitude of the issue , ' ' they will form parent action groups in each state. // ' ' By organizing a group as the environmentalists did , as seniors did , as ( nuclear ) freeze people did , I think you ' ll see Washington respond , ' ' she says. // THE need for a national family policy becomes apparent , she notes , in statistics showing that the United States ' ' is No. 1 in divorce , alcohol , drugs , and physical violence. ' ' // Arguing that there is a connection between the lack of government support and the statistics , she adds , ' ' I get so impatient with people who say , ' What you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I say , ' What I ' m advocating they do in all the capitalist countries , except here and South Africa. ' ' ' // Despite her ebullience and her everpresent smile , Schroeder - who last year was named one of the six most respected women in America in a Gallup poll - admits to ' ' a certain feeling of sadness ' ' as the 20th century draws to a close. // ' ' I believe ( the United States ) can have a strong role in the 21st century , but I don ' t believe we can if we don ' t start addressing these issues. // ' ' We can not watch our families come unwrapped , and we can not watch our financial future come unwrapped with all the debt . We ' ve got to have some answers about what our role is going to be in the 21st century , and how we ' re going to compete educationally and every other way. ' ' // At the same time Schroeder , who was the first woman to serve on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of men who now talk publicly about family policy : // ' ' We ' ve had women talking about it for a long time , ' ' she says . ' ' But it ' s getting people with power to talk about it . That ' s my message to parents : Get the people with power to talk about it and do it. // ' ' All we really want , ' ' she adds , making the task sound deceptively simple , ' ' is for people to have choices and options to enable them to be the best parent possible. ' ' // //
