Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev endorsed still another arms-control idea last week , this one for a zone in central Europe free of chemical weapons . The U.S. rejected the notion as quickly as it thumbed down Gorbachev 's suggestion last month for a moratorium on underground nuclear tests . Presidential Spokesman Larry Speakes called the chemical-free zone a " resurfacing and repackaging of ideas we have heard before " and added that , besides , it would be difficult to verify . <P> After a 16-year hiatus , the Pentagon wants to begin producing new chemical weapons again to replace its aging stockpile of existing ones . The White House contends that the Soviets have used chemical munitions in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia and claims that the Gorbachev proposal is merely a propaganda move aimed at winning support in Europe before his summit with Reagan in November . While that may be the case , the Administration continues to find itself faced with agile Soviet diplomatic gambits that could give the Kremlin a public relations advantage , particularly among America 's European allies .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
