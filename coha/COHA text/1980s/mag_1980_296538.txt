This week 's cover story on the state of capitalism as the 1980s begin reflects the reporting of correspondents in many of TIME 'S bureaus , both in the capitalist world and beyond . But much of the research was done by Associate Editor George M. Taber , who wrote the story as well as an accompanying side bar on capitalism 's roots in history . <P> Taber , who joined TIME 'S New York staff last summer after two years as our economics correspondent in Washington , found the assignment absorbing-so much so that at one point he spent a series of eleven-hour days poring over texts on his subject in the stacks of the Princeton University library , which is near his home . " Here at last , " says Taber , " was a chance to grapple with the economic problems I had studied in Washington , to explore their complex causes and long-range social implications . " <P> Taber was assisted by Reporter-Researchers Charles Alexander and Robert Grieves , who helped to pin down such fine points as the cost of gasoline in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic , and whether Marie Antoinette really did say , " Let them eat cake " ( she did not ) . Says Alexander : " Happily , we had to reach out of our accustomed economic niche to become students of history , literature and philosophy . " Last week TIME opened its first bureau on mainland China since our office in Shanghai was closed in September 1949 , four months after the city was taken over by the forces of Mao Tse-tung . The newest of our 31 bureaus is located in Peking 's Qianmen Hotel , ten minutes by car from the Chinese capital 's broad Tiananmen Square . Last August TIME became the first U.S. newsmagazine to be circulated in China . Our reporting on that country will be much enriched by the presence there of our new bureau chief , Richard Bernstein . <P> He began learning his Mandarin while doing graduate work in Chinese history at Harvard in 1966 . After writing five cover stories on events in China as a TIME writer from 1973 to 1976 , he went to our bureau in Hong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began allowing U.S. news organizations to station correspondents in China , American journalists could travel in the country occasionally , but for the most part they had to monitor developments from Hong Kong , through newspapers , broadcasts and talks with returning travelers . <P> " Editorials in People 's Daily will remain an important news source , " says Bernstein . " But , as an ancient Chinese proverb says , ' A thousand words of hearsay are not worth a single glance at the reality . ' "
