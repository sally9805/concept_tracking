Programmer Brandon Tartikoff leads NBC out of the cellar <P> Fade in : Midnight at the Tartikoff home in the Coldwater Canyon section of Beverly Hills . Baby Daughter Calla Lianne has awakened , and her parents are trying to lull her back to sleep to the strains of the Tonight show . The guest is Comedian Bill Cosby , who is doing a funny routine about the trials of middle-aged parents . As the father watches , a light goes on in his head . <P> Montage : Actors being hired , sets being built , scenes being rehearsed . <P> Cut to : NBC 's offices in Burbank , several months later . Network executives are celebrating the latest Nielsen ratings : after nine straight seasons in last place in the prime-time race , NBC has finally moved up to No. 2 . Its new hit The Cosby Show , a sitcom about the trials of middle-aged parents , is a major reason . <P> Brandon Tartikoff s ideas do not always follow such a smooth path to success , but no one is more entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven president of NBC Entertainment has been trying to write a happy ending for one of the longest-running sob stories in TV history . Season in , season out , NBC rethought its strategy , retooled its schedule , introduced a slew of new shows-and wound up , as usual , deep in the ratings cellar . Asked early this fall if he had anything else to throw in if his new schedule fizzled , Tartikoff replied , " My resignation . " <P> But the schedule has hardly fizzled . Besides The Cosby Show , NBC has another successful new series in Michael Landon 's Highway to Heaven , and several returning shows are also doing well . These , combined with such high-rated TV movies as last week 's Fatal Vision , have helped the network vault into a strong second position , only three-tenths of a rating point behind CBS for the season so far , and 1.6 points ahead of the sinking ABC . <P> That Tartikoff was able to survive so long and eventually prevail in a notoriously precarious job is just one of many anomalies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majored in English , Tartikoff , 35 , has the wit and offhand manner of a hip assistant professor . In the office he often appears in crew-neck sweaters and never wears a watch . The modest three-bedroom home where he lives with his wife Lilly and daughter lacks such California status symbols as a swimming pool and tennis court . During off-hours , Tartikoff enjoys shooting baskets ( on his one extravagance , a home court that his wife gave him for Father 's Day ) and playing third base in a Saturday-morning softball league ( " a smart ballplayer and a good spray hitter , " appraises one teammate ) . Moreover , in a business where the top dogs are usually tightlipped , Tartikoff is candid and accessible-qualities that have made him the most publicized network programmer since his legendary mentor , Fred Silverman . <P> The son of a clothing manufacturer , Tartikoff grew up on Long Island , where he used to stay home from school to watch sitcoms like December Bride and My Little Margie . He foresaw his calling on a Sunday night in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family set to watch the premiere episode of Dennis the Menace . " After it was over , " Tartikoff recalls , " I turned to my parents and said , ' They could have made that show much better . ' "
