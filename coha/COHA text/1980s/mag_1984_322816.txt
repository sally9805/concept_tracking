Giving cancer patients a lift on the company plane <P> Karen Janszen , 34 , had never flown in a small aircraft . She was therefore apprehensive last May 17 as she boarded the eight-seat Hawker Siddeley jet of AMF , the sports-equipment and industrial-technology manufacturer , for a trip from Houston to Westchester County Airport in White Plains , N.Y . Two years ago , Janszen underwent surgery in Methodist Hospital to remove a malignant brain tumor , and she was returning from Houston after chemotherapy treatments . AMF Chairman W. Thomas York , who was in Houston for business meetings , was giving her a free lift on the company plane . The in-flight accommodations delighted Janszen . Said she : " Everyone was wonderful . They served us food and drinks and told us a little about their company . " <P> Janszen and AMF got together with the help of the Corporate Angel Network ( CAN ) . Based in White Plains , CAN provides free rides on corporate aircraft for cancer patients , either singly or in groups , to and from hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the flights that corporations will be making with the departure and destination cities requested by patients . A nonprofit organization begun in 1981 , CAN in its first year flew 24 patients ; it now arranges that many trips each month . So far , CAN has flown 259 sick people , many of them accompanied by a companion , more than 600,000 miles . Last month CAN won the President 's Volunteer Action Award . <P> Other patients share Janszen 's enthusiasm for CAN . A. Donald Hodges , 52 , pastor of the United Methodist Church in Westport , Conn. , in recent years has undergone surgery twice for cancer . Thanks to the Corporate Angels , on both occasions he was able to deliver his Sunday-morning sermon and still arrive at Leigh Memorial Hospital in Norfolk by Monday morning . Says Hodges : " I 'm impressed by the fact that someone cares and is offering a helping hand . " Concurs Harry Kass of Brooklyn , 23 , who last April flew on an AT &T; company plane from San Francisco to Morristown , N.J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to avoid crowds on a commercial flight when my immune system was weakened by drugs . " <P> CAN is the creation of Priscilla Blum , 59 , a freelance writer and pilot who had a mastectomy in 1969 . She knew that cancer patients have to spend heavily on commercial flights to get the best treatment possible and that those expenses are rarely covered by medical insurance . Blum , who keeps a single-engine Comanche at the Westchester airport , also knew that many corporate jets have empty seats when they take off . Her idea was simply to put patients on the planes . To help make her plan work , Blum enlisted the aid of her friend Jay Weinberg , 66 , a former cancer patient and owner of an Avis car-rental franchise . Unfortunately , corporate sponsors were initially slow to sign up . The turning point came in January 1983 , when David Mahoney , chairman of Norton Simon , was forced to cancel a corporate flight that was to carry a cancer patient to the West Coast . As a consolation , Mahoney wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help CAN . In response , 100 firms signed up . Today more than 270 firms participate in CAN , including American Express , AT &T,; Champion International , General Foods , Merrill Lynch , Reader 's Digest and Time Inc.
