Politicians and scholars debate the merits ofmultibillion-dollar mergers <P> Mobil plans to bid $8 billion for Conoco . Penn Central offers $1.4 billion for Colt Industries . Heileman Brewing Co. opens talks on a possible merger with Schlitz Brewing . <P> <P> The frenzy of bid-a-billion merger making again rippled through American business last week . Company presidents nervously looked for corporate marriage partners , bankers arranged billion-dollar lines of credit , and investors wildly bid up stocks that looked like potential takeover targets . But , as the madding crowds continued to get in on the deals , more and more executives , academics and politicians were becoming concerned about the merger mania . Even those who approve of mergers in principle are stunned by the sheer size and number of the new corporate couplings . <P> The match-ups made in the past few months link familiar names in almost every American industry : American Express and Shearson Loeb Rhoades , Prudential and Bache , Nabisco and Standard Brands , Sohio and Kennecott . If the present frenetic pace of takeovers continues , U.S. companies could spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other firms . <P> But is this rush of corporate marriages really good for the U.S. economy ? Will this help get America out of the economic stagnation of the past decade ? Does bigness mean greater efficiency for business ? Many were dubious about the benefits of the big deals . Said New Jersey Democrat Peter Rodino , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , as he called for congressional hearings on antitrust policy : " This sudden seizure of merger madness could slow down our nation 's economic growth . " Added Wall Street 's Felix Rohatyn , one of the leading merger makers : " There 's too much macho involved . This has become show biz . " <P> Others , though , insisted that the takeovers and acquisitions were both necessary and overdue . Said Robert Bork , a top antitrust expert and former Solicitor General : " We 've won the war intellectually by showing the efficiencies and economies of scale that grow from consolidations . A lot of mergers that should have taken place were held back for years because of the Justice Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week , bidding intensified in the most extravagant sweepstakes in corporate history-the takeover of Conoco , the ninth biggest American petroleum company . Mobil , the second largest U.S. oil firm , said it was planning to hike its cash offer for 51% of Conoco to $95 per share . <P> For the moment at least , that would equal the $95 per share offer by Du Pont , the biggest U.S. chemical producer , for up to 51% of Conoco stock and top a $92 per share offer from Canada 's Seagram , the world 's largest liquor distiller . Though Conoco 's price tag is now about $8 billion . Wall Streeters expect the bidding to surge even higher . Almost completely overshadowed by the Conoco battle was the announcement last week that the Penn Central Corp. , a conglomerate with holdings of everything from oil rigs to amusement parks , would acquire Colt Industries , a diversified manufacturer of firearms and engines , for $1.4 billion . Such paltry billion-dollar deals now pass almost unnoticed .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
