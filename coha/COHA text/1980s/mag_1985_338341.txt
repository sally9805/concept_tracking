The memoir starts with a profound error : " In the beginning , " writes Gloria Vanderbilt , " a child believes that all other children are in the same world that she or he inhabits . That is how a poor child defines all others , and that is how a rich child defines all others . " <P> In fact , deprived children are cruelly aware of those who have more ; the streets and screens provide all the evidence they need . It is only the privileged young who can be free , however briefly , from envy . Given this flaw , Once Upon a Time , an account of the heiress 's first 17 years , might have been a mere riches-to-rags saga of Society 's Child , who proved that success was largely a matter of jeans . Instead the author speaks in melancholy outbursts about an evaporated world of titled men and breathtaking women , of movie stars and mansions and what seemed to be a permanently floodlighted arena lacking only one component : love . <P> Gloria Sr. was 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later , Little Gloria 's father , Reggie Vanderbilt , died of inadequacy and excess , burned out at 44 . Mama , a society beauty with the social conscience of a moth , fluttered from Europe to the U.S. and back again . Little Gloria became a piece of human luggage , shuttled from country places to castles , possessed by magical thoughts : " If I stayed still enough , the motor would start . If I held my breath , the front door would not open . . . I made a bargain with myself not to cry , and then the coach would glide away , away from the grey house where nobody lived , away away away . " <P> No amount of wishing could prevent her from becoming the most publicized child of the ' 30s . Appalled by whispers of Gloria Sr. 's loose life of pornographic orgies and sapphic lovers , Little Gloria 's paternal aunt , Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney , sued for custody of the child in 1934 and won . In the best account of this celebrated trial , Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara Goldsmith argued that a greater anguish lay below the ten-year-old 's fear of being torn from her home in some Solomonic decision . " I was afraid she would take me away , " Gloria had testified , " . . . do something . . . then IT will happen . " Here , Goldsmith theorizes , the girl was subtly conscious of the second most famous child of ' 30s headlines , the Lindbergh baby , who had been taken from his home and murdered : " IT , " writes Goldsmith , " was death . " <P> Although this specific dread is unacknowledged by the autobiographer , it seems to be the subtext of the hearing and all that follows : " I had been led on into a strange country , a country that knew no boundaries and was called Pain . " Terrified of strangers , besieged by reporters , taunted in schools , Gloria blinks through a chaos of flashbulbs and interrogations ; in a nation wasted by the Depression , she becomes America 's real-life Little Orphan Annie .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
