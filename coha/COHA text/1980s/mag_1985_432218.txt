 | A t first glance , Bonnie Berman is the allAmerican cover girl . Blond , blue-eyed and dimpled , she has a playful smile that lights up the runway . Closer inspection , however , reveals a nose just shy of perfect , a forehead a bit too prominent . The highfashion model deviates from the norm in another respect as well : a graduate of Princeton , Bonnie , 23 , plans to return to academia for an advanced degree in Soviet studies whenever her days in the limelight dim . Seventeen-year-old Talisa Soto boasts a different sort of distinctiveness . Unquestionably lovely , with glittering black eyes , tawny complexion and a precociously sultry mien , Talisa is Puerto Rican ? the first to break into modeling 's inner sanctum . Elisabetta Ramella , too , has made it to the top on her own terms . Despite the vogue for short hair , Elisabetta , 25 , has steadfastly refused to trim her unruly brunette mane ? even at the cost of plum assignments . " It 's hard to keep one 's identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more money , " says the Swiss-born beauty . One reason , perhaps , for her cool detachment is that she never wanted to be a model . " At 20 , I thought I had to be a lawyer so people would n't think I was dumb , " explains Elisabetta . Now , she says , " Maybe the money will buy me a wonderful education . " Paper dolls , indeed ! As Bonnie , Talisa and Elisabetta demonstrate so beautifully , today 's top models are hardly cut from the same pattern . In fact , they 've never been more different ? not only from one another , but from their predecessors , too . For years , modeling was synonymous with classic good looks , but now the fashion industry has embraced a more offbeat notion of beauty . Exaggerated features ? large lips , say , or a not-quite-perfect nose ? are welcome . Short-haired brunettes and boyish blondes have challenged the Christie Brinkley genre of tousled girl next door . And overtly ethnic girls ? Puerto Rican , Oriental ? are stirring up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than skin deep . Today 's models not only look more unusual but , arguably , think differently ? about themselves and their profession . Bonnie and Elisabetta exemplify a new breed whose ability to project intelligence and spirit is an essential part of their appeal . " Personality " ? modeling 's current buzzword ? is becoming as important to success as a slim figure . " All together , we are moving into the age of the individual , " says Frances Grill , president of Click Model Management , which represents Talisa and Elisabetta . " What 's wanted now is someone with more than a surface image . " Indeed , in the four years since Grill and two partners set up shop , Click has almost singlehandedly changed the face of modeling in this country . It has made success stories out of aspirants no one else would touch and introduced a more personal way of doing business in a field controlled by such mega-agencies as Ford and Elite . " There will always be @#  | a Ford , and Ford is excellent , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a need for smaller agencies . " Now , its position established , Click has begun to feel growing pains of its own : it has lost several models , including Bonnie , to a new crop of small agencies and leveled a million-dollar lawsuit against Calvin Klein on charges of signing Jose Borain to a three-year , $1 million contract behind its back . Monster ' : Whether Click created the American market for unconventional models or simply cornered it early on is hard to say . But clearly , even mainstream agencies have done well with the new look . For example , the reigning long-haired blonde , Ford 's Renee Simonsen , is far from a plastic beauty . " If you look at Renee in real life , she is almost a monster , " says photographer Alex Chatelain . " Her mouth is too big , her eyes are too much the way they are , and yet , put her in front of a camera and it all works . " Elite 's Deirdre Maguire , who began modeling five years ago , endured a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her towheaded boyish freshness . After a stint in Europe , Deirdre returned to a changing climate ? long hair was out , punkish clothes were in ? that perfectly suited her tough tomboyish stance . Last year , her apotheosis complete , she won a hefty contract as the 1'Oreal mousse girl that recently was renewed . When it comes to looking tough , though , nobody can touch Swedish-born Lenita Oderfaldt , one of the most sought-after runway and print models . Another cropped , boyish blonde , Lenita combines what Vogue fashion editor Polly Mellen calls a " superb , very female , curvaceous body " with an icy insolence that defines " attitude . " A passionate motorcyclist , Lenita periodically drops out of the modeling rat race of constant travel to fashion shows and on-location photo shoots to teach Swedish soldiers riding stunts . That spirit shows up on the printed page : Lenita instantly conveys the sort of independence that fashion editors and photographers have come to value . " Women have become their own person , so models have to look like their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antonio Lopez . The revolution in looks grew , in part , out of female anger over traditional male notions about feminine beauty . " A lot of the people making the decisions are women , and they got fed up , " suggests Elite director John Casablancas , who prefers a more conventional approach for his own agency . " They wanted style , grace , a sense of movement ? all the things women appreciate in other women . " For example , Bethann Hardison , who took Bonnie and Ariane Koizumi with her when she left Click to form Bethann Management Co. last June , says she goes after " a boy mentality ? a presence that is aggressive , like a fellow 's , but feminine . " And muscle tone has become a vital asset , with magazines no longer interested in painfully thin models . Significantly , the new standards have also opened the door to ethnic beauties who , in the old days , might never have gotten past the receptionist . The extraordinary success of Talisa , who earns approximately $300,000 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break into Vogue 's pages . Ariane , who is half Japanese and half Dutch , has only begun to make it after more than four years in the business . But even now , Vogue and the other magazines tend to play it somewhat safe : for all their popularity , neither Talisa nor Ariane has graced an American cover , and brunettes who get there tend to have blue eyes . Racism : Despite the ethnic vogue , black models , who took the runways by storm in the early ' 70s , seem to be less in demand now for reasons that are not entirely clear . Model agent Eileen Ford believes that their relatively low profile is mere coincidence . " You 're not going to get the most gorgeous black girl every day , " says Ford . " You find them when you find them . " But others detect shades of racism . " It used to be compulsory to have blacks , but now that they buy everything , advertisers feel they do n't need them , " says the Somalianborn supermodel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black models , and it brings resentments . " There is another , albeit less insidious form of prejudice all models endure : being thought shallow is a hazard of the profession . " When a woman is concerned with the length of her skirt , she 's considered stupid , " says Bonnie , who studies poetry-writing and  | speaks Russian . " But to be a professional in any field requires you to focus on certain things , and the center of our business happens to be clothes . I get as serious about it as I would about politics . " For the " new girls , " as they are called , such smaller agencies as Click , Bethann and the 10-month-old Name have been a godsend because of their willingness to allow flexible schedules ? and their studied commitment to unconventionality . " Click realized that what makes people attractive are the other things in their lives , " says fashion producer Kezia Keeble . " It 's given models an opportunity to maintain their integrity by showing them it could be done in different ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the competitiveness of the field and the extraordinarily high remuneration ( top models earn from $150,000 to upwards of half a million a year if they have exclusive contracts with cosmetic companies or designers ) require utter professionalism on the job ? and at managing portfolios . " The breed of models from ' 79 on are better with their money and more financially secure than ever , " says Iman . Because the career has such a short half-life ? it rarely lasts more than a decade and usually a good deal less ? more models than ever are taking acting and singing lessons . Academic courses provide another important cushion for the future . And during the feast years , many are careful to invest in more than their education . Elite model Joan Severance is practically a one-woman conglomerate : currently at work on a novel , she is part-owner of a ski-resort restaurant , a caterTalisa : A first ing firm and a charter boat in St. Thomas . What may make giving up the glamour easier is the wary perspective the new girls have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never wanted to be anything but . Others simply stumbled into the field when they were discovered by one of an army of paid and voluntary talent scouts . And there are those who , like Elisabetta , simply knew they had what it takes and needed the money . The blue-eyed brunette , who began modeling to help pay her way through school , made up her mind to make the most of her looks ? and move on when the time came . " It 's a great opportunity , " says Elisabetta . " I would tell people : do your best , do n't be so greedy that you are eaten up by the business , realize there 's an end and prepare for it . Thank God there 's a limit . Imagine how awful it would be if it could last till you were 80. "
