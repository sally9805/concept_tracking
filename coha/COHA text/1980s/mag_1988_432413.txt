 | Stocks took another scary tumble last week , and Wall Street hastened to deliver its own early verdict in the New York primary . To no one 's surprise , it was a vote of resounding no confidence . And as the Dow Jones industrial average slumped to its fifth-worst one-day loss ever , the message to the would-be Presidents scurrying about the streets of the Big Apple was clear , if not yet compelling : They had better pay heed to the psychoses-inducing swings in the Dow , and if they really want to be President , they 'd better start coming up with a plan to rein in the powerful forces driving the market through its wild gyrations . For the men and women of Wall Street , these are deeply unsettling times , not just because of the market 's turbulence but because , at this critical juncture in the nation 's fiscal life , they have virtually no clues as to how the presidential candidates would deal with an economy beset by huge and seemingly intractable trade and budget deficits . In election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were usually reliable guides , according to Yale Hirsch , editor of the Stock Trader 's Almanac . If the Dow Jones industrial average was higher on the Monday before Election Day than it was at the start of the year , the theory went , a Republican would win the White House . Conversely , if the Dow was down from its January 1 start , then a Democrat would be the next President . The beauty of the theory was that it usually worked . In all but six of the 23 elections held since 1900 , the pattern held . But what about this year ? Tremors and aftershocks . This year , to be blunt , is bizarre . Despite last October 's Wall Street crash and the aftershocks that continue to rumble through the financial bazaars , there is an abundance of evidence to suggest that the markets are apprehensive about the candidates , and the candidates have little to say about the markets . Indeed , despite last week 's plunge in the Dow in response to a surprisingly bad February trade-deficit number , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall Street was to mix it up at posh fundraisers with Manhattan 's glitterati , including a sprinkling of investment bankers . At a private party on upper Fifth Avenue in the city 's silk-stocking district , Michael Dukakis persuaded a crowd of elite supporters to write checks for $200,000 . A leading black entrepreneur , TLC Chairman Reginald Lewis , hosted a big cash bash for Jesse Jackson , who pulled in $90,000 . And at the Pierre Hotel , as the 1812 Overture blared in the background and gold-masked dancers writhed to the strains , Tennessee Senator Albert Gore greeted contributors who kicked in $330,000 for a last-ditch New York media blitz . Gore , the only candidate to actually visit the New York Stock Exchange , spoke of such things as " gold- en parachutes , " the sweetheart exit contracts for executives deposed in takeovers . It was , for many Wall Streeters , frustrating . " The candidates will eventually be forced to talk realistically about the economy , " says John Heimann , vice chairman of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and the former comptroller of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic program , and all the candidates will have to be up front about that . " " Sitting it out " : It would be nice , however , if Wall Street , with all its influence on the pols , would find time to push the issue just a little bit harder . To date , the financial community , like the nation at large , has taken only a desultory interest in the campaign . For those who have been paying attention , the consensus is that Dukakis will almost certainly be the contender against Bush , who already has the Republican nomination in the bag . But most in the financial community have given presidential politics a wide berth , perhaps because they are so preoccupied with the roller-coaster antics of the market and its effect on the brokerage business . " What 's significant so far , " says Gore supporter Tom Tisch , an investment banker and son of CBS Chairman Laurence Tisch , " is that Wall Street is largely sitting this one out . " There has been one visible , if indirect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets : The boom in takeovers , running at a $300 billion annual rate for the first four months of the year , or more than double the previous record . Deal makers are working with feverish urgency to get deals done this year in order to take advantage of the Reagan administration 's laissez-faire approach to the antitrust laws . Dukakis has made an issue of tighter merger rules , and even Bush , it is believed , will go along with some increased restrictions . Bush , according to the smart money on the Street , will be the next President . A humming economy , unemployment at its lowest point since 1979 and a moderate inflation rate are all powerful factors in his favor , so far obscuring the underlying  | deficit problems . Also , there 's a bit of wishful thinking at work . If one buys the conventional wisdom , which comes especially cheap during a political season in which almost every bit of prognostication has been wrong , the return of the same party to power is an emphatically bullish signal for the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a Democratic challenger wins the Oval Office , is considered bearish . The evidence on this point is pretty persuasive . In the 22 elections held since 1900 , when the incumbent party has returned to power , the market has risen by just over 15 percent . But in those years when the challenger has taken the Oval Office , the market has dipped an average of about 1.5 percent . Good news for the Duke ? The conventional wisdom may not be applicable in 1988 . While Wall Street is a Republican bastion , and most of the moneymen are backing Bush , it is thought ? even by GOP partisans ? that the Vice President could have a tough time of it , particularly if there 's another stock-market collapse , which could shake the economy 's equilibrium , or if the Federal Reserve Board pushes interest rates much higher in order to keep the dollar from nose-diving . That could cause an untimely stall for the GOP just prior to Election Day . " The market 's drop last week is very bad news for George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Hale , chief economist with Kemper Financial Services , " because it means there 's going to be a very close race this fall . At the least , it demonstrates that the causes of the crash have not been eliminated . It also undermines the appeal of Reaganomics . " And , very possibly , George Bush . Reagan 's No. 2 has so far tied himself closely to the President 's economic policies , and many question whether he has the personal strength to manage an economic comeback . Bush has pledged not to raise taxes and has proposed cutting capital-gains taxes further , to 15 percent , for profits on the sale of securities or property . Though the latter proposal is attractive to the investment community , the no-tax-increase promise is greeted with cynicism across the board . It is viewed by the financial community as something Bush feels he must say in order to get elected . " That 's voodoo economics all over again , " says Robert Pirie , president of Rothschild , Inc . " You ca n't continue to run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dukakis gets roughed up even more . While the Duke is generally regarded as competent by the investment community , he is almost a blank slate where economic policy is concerned . In the view of many Wall Street experts , Dukakis was only a minor factor in the state 's economic boom , which was mirrored in every other state in New England and therefore was a regional phenomenon ? not a result of the governor 's programs . " He is far more unknown than Bush , " says Heimann . " And when he talks about the Massachusetts miracle ' a lot of people just smile . " The Baker factor : If Bush has a decided edge over Dukakis in a fall showdown , it is in Jim Baker ; but even then , there are no guarantees . With his hands on the financial levers in the waning weeks and days of the campaign ( Baker said last week he would remain as Treasury Secretary and not join the Bush campaign , as many expected ) , the Vice President 's old pal , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keel and prevent another economic tsunami from washing the Bush campaign up on the rocks . " Baker 's strategy , " says Lawrence Kudlow , chief economist for Bear , Stearns and a former aide to David Stockman when he was budget director , " has been to keep a steady dollar so there 's no drop in the stock market , which would reflect poorly on Republican economic management and be an embarrassment to Bush . " A yen for stability : Can the strategy work ? For even the most devoted Bush backers , last week 's roiling of the markets suggests only the most tentative answers . Particularly unfortunate was the fact that , just the day before the Dow dove and the dollar tanked , It ... Baker was meeting with the financial ministers of the major industrial countries , trumpeting his intent to keep stabilizing the dollar . The very next morning , with the announcement of a bulge in the February trade deficit to $13.8 billion , currency speculators called his bluff , and the dollar plummeted against the West German deutsche mark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At a hastily called press conference , Baker warned that too much significance was being placed on a single month 's trade number , given the fact that the overall trend had been positive in recent months . But the financial markets plunged as they did , not because of the specific statistic but because of what it implies . " It suggests that the amount of trade improvement from the lower dollar has been very slow in coming , " says Steven Einhorn , vice chairman of the investment-policy committee at Goldman , Sachs . Translation : There wo n't be much improvement on the trade front in 1988 , unless the dollar goes even lower . The Federal Reserve Board , in that scenario , may feel forced to raise interest rates to defend the greenback ? in turn feeding fears that such a move will choke off the economy 's expansion . " It raises the fear that the U.S. will only be able to get its trade deficit down by having a recession , " says Kemper 's Hale , " or by continuing to push the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men who would be President in campaign ' 88 , is that they ignore the message of the market at their own peril , or should they be fortunate enough to win in November , the peril of the country .
