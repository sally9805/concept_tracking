( AT RISE : The living room of a one bedroom apartment . OFF RIGHT we can see a bar and the edge of a kitchen . There is a couch , dining area , stereo large floor pillows , French posters , a small table and some chairs . The place has a nice feel to it , although nothing is expensive . At best , it is bohemian . Laughter is heard offstage AS THE LIGHTS FADE UP , SARAH and DIANE enter from the kitchen . SARAH carries a bottle of wine , DIANE carries wine glasses . They cross to the couch . SARAH 's glance falls to the wedding invitation on the table . She picks it up , puts it back down . CHERYL yelling offstage . ) CHERYL Close your eyes ! DIANE ( Yelling back ) We 're waiting . Anytime . SARAH ( TO DIANE , sotto voce ) I ca n't believe another one of us is biting the dust . DIANE Nothing wrong with marriage , Sarah . SARAH When she invited me to this all-night party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . She wants us here . Is that so hard to understand ? SARAH We 're adults , for christ 's sake . DIANE I needed to get out of Chicago . ( She takes a drink of wine . ) Do n't complain anymore . It 's rude . Makes your face ugly . ( CHERYL enters , carrying a sack of groceries . DIANE and SARAH turn and greet her. ) p. 3 CHERYL Surprise ! ( DIANE and SARAH look at her blankly ) CHERYL Well , here it is ! Enough fattening food to last 2 days of solid eating . ( She pulls out food from her bag . ) I 've got popcorn , Sara Lee brownies , M and M 's , both peanut and plain , chocolate chip ice cream . Do I know you or what ? Is this your favorite food or what ? SARAH Oh my God . I can feel it already . On my things . On my hips . DIANE It 's been years since I 've had any of this stuff ! CHERYL Hands off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What for ? She wo n't eat any of this . Too busy watching her figure You know . " The Figure . " CHERYL We 're waiting for Roxy . What good is reminiscing without the four of us ? SARAH Oh . Is that what we 're here for ? DIANE ( To SARAH ) Melancholia . A normal condition for a bride-to-be , especially on the night before . SARAH When do we get to meet the groom ? CHERYL Oh , I do n't know . The evening is young . Have another drink . ( She takes SARAH 's glass and pours her another drink. ) p. 4 SARAH Tell us about him . Brick , Rock . CHERYL Who ? DIANE You 've heard of him , Cheryl . The groom ? CHERYL Oh , him . Right . Brock . Brock Bailey . He 's wonderful . SARAH That 's it ? CHERYL He 's intelligent . Very romantic . DIANE Does he do anything ? CHERYL He 's good singer . And he loves to dance . DIANE ( Starting to waltz around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , a waltz , tripping the light fantastic . Joyous , romantic . Slowly , Your rhythm fades , degenerates . Your partner is tired of leading . You did n't know he was leading . But as long as he likes to dance , that 's all that matters . He 'll hang on . SARAH And then what ? You polka ? DIANE ( Knowingly ) If you 're lucky . ( The doorbell rings . ROXY 's VOICE is heard offstage . ) ROXY Hello ! Anybody there ? SARAH Oh my God . I 'd know that voice anywhere . DIANE Roxy ? p. 5 CHERYL Hey , Roxy ! Hold on . ( She crosses to the door and opens it . ROXY is there , dressed provocatively , with flash . She has one suitcase . ) ROXY ( Entering ) Damn it ! Do n't we look good ! ( She is giggling , full of energy . ) CHERYL Are n't you a sight for sore eyes ! You look terrific ! ROXY My God , it 's the bride-to-be , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you ? ( They embrace . ) CHERYL Fine . And you ? ROXY Better now that I see all of you ! ( See crosses to SARAH ) Sarah ! How are you ? SARAH Great ! ROXY ( With sincerity ) Hello , Diane . DIANE Long time no see , Rox . ROXY How are Les and Chrissy ? DIANE Fine . How 's your career going ? CHERYL She 's in a movie with John Travolta ! SARAH No shit ? CHERYL She just found out this week , right , Roxy ? p. 6 ROXY ( Uneasy ) It was really just an audition . I mean , nothing 's definite in this business . DIANE We all hoped it would happen sometime . Here 's to our star , Roxy . ( She raises her glass in toast . ) CHERYL Here , here . Makes me feel so boring . DIANE Why ? Marriage is a big step ! CHERYL Who needs marriage when you can work with Travolta ? ROXY It 's no big deal , really . Where do I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom . Excuse us . We 'll be right back . ( She takes ROXY 's suitcase and CHERYL and ROXY exit . ) SARAH All four of us together again . Just like old times . DIANE Some reunion . SARAH Remember when we 'd get together every Friday night and drink and drink and drink ? We 'd drink each other under the tables . It was always the same bar , and we 'd always try to walk a straight line afterwards . None of us could , but we always took care of each other . ( ROXY and CHERYL re-enter . ) ROXY Yeah , even through our drunken little fights . It 's so great to have all four of us in the same room again . Cheryl , pour me a drink . p. 7 CHERYL ( Crossing to the bar ) What 'll it be ? Margarita ? Shot of tequila ? ROXY Miss Fournay , you insult my gentility . Champagne , please , to celebrate this joyous occasion ! DIANE ( Toasting again ) Here 's to sacrifice . Here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a celebration . CHERYL ( Toasting ) Here 's to sleeping with John Travolta . SARAH You 're already sleeping with him ? ROXY We really have n't started shooting . I 'll know more in a month . Cheryl , I like your choices here . This is a cute place . CHERYL ( Passing out drinks ) Thanks . Wo n't be here much longer , I 'm afraid . DIANE Did you already buy a house ? CHERYL No , we 're going on a cruise , around the world . ROXY With your money or his ? DIANE ( Reprimanding ) Roxy . ROXY I was just wondering . CHERYL Mine . p. 8 DIANE ( To ROXY ) Is that all right with you ? ROXY If I ca n't ask my friend or twelve years that question  --  SARAH ( Interjecting ) So , let 's open the brownies . What do you say ? CHERYL Great idea . ( She crosses to the kitchen , and comes back with knife and napkins . SARAH follows with Sara Lee Brownies . ) Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the night . Hot nights , when none of us could sleep , roaming the house like vampires , moaning about the humidity , the stuffiness , and devouring Sara Lee brownies just to pass the time . We were always waiting . Hot and waiting . Which reminds me , I forgot the ice . Excuse me for a moment , oh most honorable guests . ( She crosses into the kitchen and exits . ) ROXY ( Sotto voce , to SARAH &amp; DIANE ) I 'd better drink like a fish to catch up with all of you . Is n't this a ridiculous idea ? The four of us spending the night together before her wedding . It makes me feel so old . DIANE It 's a symptom of something . She 's not ready for marriage . SARAH What do you know about Brock ? p. 9 ROXY Nothing . Probably some pin-prick sap after her money . DIANE She refuses to talk about him . I 've tried to get something out of her all day . He 's romantic . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds like a virile ass-hole . And we wo n't get to meet him until tomorrow , when it 's too late . DIANE Too late for what , Roxy ? Passing judgment or trying it out for yourself ? SARAH Shut up . We 're still eating . ROXY I have n't started anything . SARAH We 're here for Cheryl , remember . Surely you two can get through the weekend together in one piece for her sake . One lousy weekend . You 'd both better try . ( She pauses . ) So , what wedding presents did you bring ? ROXY Well , I thought about it for a long time . What do you get someone that you know nothing about ? I decided to forget about Brock , and just get something that Cheryl would like which was tough . DIANE It 's always been tough buying presents for someone who has more money than the three of us put together . That 's why I got her a food processor . SARAH Those are expensive ! p. 10 DIANE I tried to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . That 's why I got her lingerie . DIANE Roxy ! SARAH ( Laughing ) What kind ? ROXY A black teddy , with this great lace across the top , nice and low , and then a silk jacket to go with it . It 's easy to buy clothes for her , she 's so petite . And I knew it was something she 'd never buy herself . What the hell are honeymoons for ? Oh , and a year 's subscription to Cosmopolitan magazine . SARAH Mine sounds so dull compared to yours . DIANE I 'm sure yours is appropriate , Sarah . What is it ? SARAH Towels with parrots on them . You know how she 's always liked bright colors ? These are bright yellow , with multi-colored birds in the middle of them . ( CHERYL re-enters with ice bucket . ) CHERYL Did I miss something ? ( The 3 of them sit up . ) SARAH No , no , no , no , no , no . ROXY Let me re-phrase that , No . DIANE We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to them ) Now , you three . Do n't give anything away . I want to be completely surprised . Want another drink ? ROXY Yeah . I do . Definitely . ( CHERYL pours her a drink . The phone rings . CHERYL looks at it , then looks at all of them . SARAH gets a smile on her face and scrambles for the phone . This should happen very quickly , with spontaneity . ) SARAH ( Laughing ) I 'll get it ! It 's for me ! ( ROXY runs after her , dragging her away . ) ROXY No , I 'll get it ! ( She giggles . ) It 's personal ! CHERYL ( Joining in . ) No , it 's for me . I know it . Goddamn it , it 's the man of my dreams . SARAH But I had a good prospect ! I 'll get it ! ( The three of them clown around near the phone until finally CHERYL answers it , and SARAH and ROXY are clustered around her . DIANE sips her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello ? ( She pauses . ) Diane , it 's for you . ( She hands her the phone . ) DIANE It 's probably Les . ( She crosses to bar , where the phone is. ) p. 12 SARAH ( To ROXY ) Deja vu . Can you believe it ? DIANE ( Picking up phone ) Hello ? Yeah Slow down , slow down No , I want you to take care of it . That happens all the time . What ? All right , let me talk to her . ( She changes to her " Mommy " voice : ) Chrissy ! Honey , What 's the matter ? Does your stomach hurt ? Be a good girl and do n't bother Daddy unless it 's serious . What did you have for dinner ? No wonder . ( She covers the phone and says to ROXY and SARAH . ) Burger Hut ! ( She uncovers the phone and returns to " Mommy " voice : ) Listen to me , Chrissy . Lie down on your stomach , and think about floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your favorite people will be there Yes , Mommy and Daddy will be there . Go to sleep . Mommy loves and misses you very much . I 'll see you Sunday . Please go to sleep . Let me talk to Daddy . ( Her voice changes back : ) Put her to bed , she 'll be fine No , I wo n't fly home tonight . Are you nuts ? I just got here . You 're the one who took her to Burger Hut . She 'll be fine in the morning . Yes , that 's right See if you can do one thing by yourself . ( She hangs up . ) ROXY Trouble ? DIANE ( Making fun of it . ) " Chrissy has a tummy ache and Daddy does n't know what to do ! " Where 's the wine ? ( She pours herself a drink. ) p. 13 ROXY I ca n't believe someone calls you " Mommy " . DIANE Me neither . ROXY How 's your marriage ? DIANE It 's not Passion City . SARAH ( Interjecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my job ? DIANE How 's your job ? SARAH You want to talk ruts ? The pits ? Let 's talk about my job . A receptionist for an oil company in Houston . Are you depressed or what ? ROXY I 've heard some good things about geologists , about them being solid where it counts . SARAH Where 'd you hear that ? On a bumper sticker ? They 're solid all right . Solid rock in the brain . ROXY So why do you stay ? SARAH For every other Friday . Pay day . Hard cash in the checking account . CHERYL I 've got a great idea . I want to play levitation , just the four of us . Remember ? Like we used to ? DIANE ( Jokingly ) Regression . A definite sign . CHERYL What ? p. 14 ROXY ( Playing ) She said , " levitation . A favorite of mine . " SARAH ( Giggling ) No shit . Levitation ? DIANE It could be the wine . ROXY She said , " It could be divine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Snickering ) This is a joke , right ? CHERYL No . I 'm serious . DIANE ( Laughing ) Levitation ? CHERYL Yeah . One person lies down , the others touch her , fingertips under her limbs . When the moment arises , she is lifted , spiritually , magically , ( the others start mouthing the words ) mystically . ( She pauses . ) Do n't you remember ? ROXY We were teenagers then . DIANE Do n't you think it 's a little late to be playing levitation ? Maybe twelve to twenty years too late . We 're grown up , Cheryl . CHERYL It 's never too late . Once you 've done it , it 's always there . It 's like driving a car . SARAH You got ta be nuts . The night before your wedding and you want to be levitated. p. 15 ROXY Rather Victorian . ( See crosses to the M and M 's . ) SARAH ( trying to change the subject ) It 's so virginal . Say , by the way , I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you so afraid of ? I think this will bring back a few things . DIANE But you 're the only one who wants to find them . ROXY She 's the one getting married tomorrow , this time , Diane . Not you . SARAH Why do n't we just take our clothes off , run around the street naked , then smoke a few . When we get cold , we can put tee-shirts on , tell a few ghost stories , pick a few wild grapes from the virgins next door . After we eat those , we can hug and kiss , vow to name our children after each other , and go to sleep in our nightgowns . CHERYL I want you to get drunk with me on the eve of my wedding , like we used to drink together . la the 1970 's ! SARAH ( Crossing to liquor ) All right . Then let 's really down the stuff . Let 's start with vodka shots . That way , we can blame whatever happens tonight on alcohol , my favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . p. 16 SARAH Drink ? ROXY No . Levitation . DIANE Where 's the goddamn vodka ? SARAH Here . ( She holds up the bottle . ) ROXY Because we really knew each other then . And it was pure . CHERYL ( To ROXY ) You want a shot ? ( ROXY shakes her head " no " . ) DIANE ( Drinking ) This seems stupid to me . Very stupid . SARAH Have another shot . ( She hands her one . ) DIANE I mean , we have n't even discussed the wedding cake . The ceremony . The groom . Is this informal or what ? When 's the photographer coming ? Is there a thematic color we should be aware of ? Anything normal or tangible about this ? ROXY The first thing we have to decide is who to levitate . Naturally , it 's between the three of you , since I 'm leading the session , and I do n't want anyone to know how much I weigh . SARAH I think you look great . ROXY I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back to L.A. I 've just got to . p. 17 DIANE You 're not going to levitate me . SARAH Cheryl seems to be hinting . CHERYL I was hoping you 'd humor me . SARAH I still think this is nuts , nuts , nuts . DIANE Cheryl , I simply do not understand . I ca n't understand why I 'm drinking and talking about floating around . ROXY Everyone sit down on the floor . I 'm cutting the lights . You got any candles , Cheryl ? ROXY Get into position . ( CHERYL crosses to the floor in front of the couch and lies down . ROXY crosses to the stereo and grabs the candles . She lights them with matches on the shelf . ) SARAH Oh , hell . Let 's cut the lights . We 're ready , Diane . We 're really delighted . DIANE Where 's the bottle ? ( She gets it and brings it over to the group on the floor . ) ROXY Sayonarra . ( She turns out the lights , and there is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) SARAH Wait . ( She bumps into the table . She finds her way to the group . DIANE and SARAH start laughing. ) p. 18 ROXY If you resist this , it 's not going to work . ( SARAH and DIANE continue to laugh , and CHERYL joins in . ) DIANE Resist ? Is there a force that 's going to come and take us away ? Here in the bowels of this godforsaken apartment ? Scare me , Roxy . What 's going to happen ? ROXY Diane . It 's not what 's going to happen . It 's what wo n't . ( DIANE &amp; SARAH snicker ) ( DIANE and SARAH move so that they are positioned on either side of CHERYL . ROXY sits at her head . ) ROXY I say " We feel you . " You repeat it . Lightly touch your hands to the sides of Cheryl 's arms and legs . ( SARAH and DIANE giggle but ROXY ignores them . ) We feel you , Cheryl Fournay . We feel your body . We feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart beating , your brain thinking , your bones aching . We feel what you feel . We feel you . DIANE AND SARAH ( Still resisting ) We feel you . ( ROXY continues , unphased by their attitude . ) ROXY We feel you . We feel you getting lighter . We feel your inner spirit pounding through your body , eager for release . We feel your energy , racing through your soul , in search of the open door . We feel your heart crying , your bones chattering , your blood singing . We feel what you feel . We feel you . p. 19 DIANA AND SARAH ( Giggling ) We feel you . ROXY We feel you sprouting wings . We feel you getting lighter and lighter . In your mind 's eye , you see the heavens open up to your soul , an angel pointing the way to your inner salvation . We feel you want to rise up to the angel . We feel you long to touch the clouds of heaven , to experience the inner tranquility of oneness with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire . We feel you losing gravity . We feel you rising , like a sunrise , towards your dreams . We feel you getting lighter and lighter . We feel you . DIANE &amp; SARAH We feel you . ROXY You 're getting lighter and lighter . You 're getting lighter and lighter . DIANE , ROXY &amp; SARAH ( In a murmur ) You 're getting lighter and lighter . You 're getting lighter and lighter . ROXY We feel you . DIANE &amp; SARAH We feel you . ROXY Lighter and lighter . DIANE &amp; SARAH Lighter and lighter . ROXY You 're going up . You 're going up . DIANE &amp; SARAH You 're going up . You 're going up . p. 20 ROXY Up , up . DIANE &amp; SARAH Up , up . ROXY ( Dramatically ) You 're going up , we feel you . You are ascending . You 're going up , up to the spiritual world . ( Slowly , we see CHERYL 'S body rise in the dim light . Comically , DIANE &amp; SARAH struggle to lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , try to stand up , and still lift her . By the expressions of their faces , we can see that this is an enormous physical struggle . ROXY , who has been very serious , suddenly starts to giggle herself , upon realizing their predicament . She moves her hands from CHERYL 's face to under her head , and tries to maintain some kind of balance . ) DIANE ( Struggling ) Help ! SARAH ( Swaying uncontrollably ) How much does she weigh ? ROXY I ca n't hold much longer . CHERYL ( Playfully ) Then let me down ! ( They tumble , in total chaos , as they drop CHERYL on to the floor . ROXY , DIANE , and SARAH all fall on top of CHERYL , madly giggling . ) CHERYL ( Laughing ) Damn it ! ROXY ( Giggling ) Are you okay ? p. 21 CHERYL I guess so . You 're sitting on my breast , Diane . ( DIANE moves . ) SARAH ( Sarcastically ) God , I 'd forgotten how eerie that stuff is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) So . Was I levitated by the spirits ? ROXY Yeah . Vodka , wine , and champagne . How did it feel ? CHERYL Wonderful ! How about some Tarot ? Or some Oui ja ? DIANE I mean , it made me tremble . SARAH It always does , the first time . DIANE But when you 're young , you do n't even think about it . No inhibitions . ROXY It brings back quite a lot . ( She crosses to her purse , pulls a pill out of her bag , and with a glass of wine , swallows it . ) Once , when Cheryl had a party , God . We were young , little virgins in our flannel P.J. 's . We had just levitated someone and we heard a bloodcurdling scream coming from the downstairs bathroom . And we shivered . The wind howled outside . Finally , one of us got up . Everyone tiptoed , following , to the bathroom . And it was Gail , screaming that she had seen herself old in the bathroom mirror . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 22 DIANE She just had an active imagination . ROXY I believed her . She saw herself old . SARAH No . Gail was too normal . It was only for nuts like us to experience the supernatural . DIANE I never thought of myself as anything out of the ordinary , and certainly I was not one of the " nuts " . SARAH No , Diane . You were so normal . Especially the way you used to ask all of us how our tampons felt upon insertion . " How narrow were we really ? " Little Miss Normal Diane . ROXY ( Laughing ) Oh , God . DIANE ( Laughing ) I think I knew the truth at that age . You know , the truth about it all . SARAH Oh , right . The truth . DIANE The truth was Roxy was always going to be out late , and her father would always call when she was out . And Sarah 's boss was always going to check to see if she really was sick . And Cheryl 's car was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are a few things in life to depend on . Remember ? We had that saying . What was it ? ( She snaps her fingers . ) The " Five F 's ! " SARAH ( Counting , excitedly ) Facts are facts . ( She holds up fingers as she goes . ) Fucks are fucks . Flings are flings . Fear is fear . And friends are friends . ( ALL laugh at the recall of it. ) p. 23 CHERYL The " Five F 's " . Was n't life simple then ? There was an " f " for everything . All you had to do was look . Studying your history ? Well , facts are facts . Celebrating a birthday ? Fear is fear . Trouble with love ? No need to write Dear Abby . You 've got your basic fucks , flings , or friends to choose from . Abortion ? No problem . Fits perfectly . Fact : you 're pregnant . You know how you got that way , and yes , it was just a fling ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're scared as hell . And who ends up sitting there with you , holding your hand ? Friends . ROXY That seems like ages ago . DIANE And when I kicked that guy out the door , it was probably the greatest moment of my life ! What was his name ? Something terribly artsy . Sterling ! His name was Sterling ! ROXY Blond guy . Gorgeous . He thought Cheryl did him wrong by not going through with it . He sure was gorgeous . The man of my dreams . DIANE Anyway , I was by the door , reading , when the doorbell rang . SARAH This sounds just like the time that I  --  DIANE It just sounds that way . It 's not . This is entirely different . I was by the door , reading , ( she stresses the next words ) when the doorbell rang . p. 24 ROXY ( Singing ) Ding dong . DIANE Thank you . And I answered it . Who was standing there in a white suit , with a bottle in his hand , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , puts on a hat of ROXY 's , grabs a bottle , and poses . ) DIANE Thank you . It was Sterling , looking very drunk . In all fairness to him , he was probably upset by the incident . ( SARAH clears her throat . ) SARAH ( In deep voice ) Excuse me . Is this where Cheryl Fournay lives ? DIANE ( Mock suspicion ) Who are you ? SARAH My name is Sterling . Sterling Simmons . Actor . Friend of hers . DIANE ( Departing into narrative ) At this point , I realized who the hell he was , the ass-hole . Look at him , standing there , wearing white no less , drinking in my face . SARAH ( Slurring words ) I want to see her . Let me in . DIANE You listen to me , buddy . And you listen good . She does n't want to see you ever again . I ca n't believe you have the nerve to show your face around here . You 're a criminal . You know that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You had your fun . You had your fun , and you show up here in false remorse . Phony ! You 're a fake ! I hate you and what you 've done ! You 're even a bad actor . p. 25 SARAH I did n't want  --  DIANE What did you want ? A good time ? And you let a little biology stir your heart , is that it ? Well , is n't that touching . A little biology changes things , does n't it ? Does n't it ? CHERYL I think I heard this fight from the bedroom . ROXY I tried to make them be quiet . CHERYL Go ahead , Roxy , do it . ROXY ( Screaming comically ) Would you two shut up ? SARAH No ! I want to see her . DIANE You think a child is going to bind you together ? Forget it . It 's only going to make you farther apart . So sayonarra , catch you on the flip side , write when you get work , and do n't take any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ass . ) SARAH ( Laughing ) Ouch ! ( She rubs where DIANE has kicked her . ) That hurt ! DIANE Getting a little soft in the butt ? SARAH ( Throwing down hat ) Lack of good use . ROXY Facts are facts . Fucks are fucks . Flings are flings . Fear is fear . Friends are friends . You know , I think that applies to my acting career . p. 26 CHERYL I wonder if I got enough M and M 's . SARAH All I want is to have someone to depend on in a living situation , that can cook , tell a few jokes , and would show me a good game of Scrabble when I 'm depressed . ROXY ( Ardently ) That 's it ? SARAH Do you know how hard it is to find someone to fulfill even one of those qualifications ? Damn near impossible . It could be my bad luck with men , I do n't know . But facts are facts . And I guess fair is fair . ( She pauses . ) Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An addendum ? It sounds all right . Facts are facts . Fucks are fucks . Flings are flings . Fear is fear . Friends are friends . And fair is fair . ROXY It has a nice ring to it . SARAH Enough philosophy . Let 's talk wedding . ( She starts humming " Here Comes the Bride . " ) CHERYL Must we ? DIANE Now , really , Cheryl . You 're being ridiculous . We 've come all this way and you 've told us nothing . It 's starting to look kind of suspicious . Where are your parents ? CHERYL ( Giggling ) Another scheduling conflict . They 're in the Bahamas . p. 27 DIANE So your parents are n't coming . Great . Who is ? CHERYL Just you and a couple of Brock 's friends , whom I 've never met . DIANE That 's it ? CHERYL Yes . DIANE Brock 's parents ? CHERYL Could n't afford to come . I did n't want a big wedding like yours , Diane . Just something simple , light , semi-wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Christ 's sake . ROXY ( Performing la commercials ) Come , taste the new carbonated drink , " Cheryl 's Wedding . " Simple . Light . Semi-Wild . Breezy . Goes with a hard game of rugby , or even with that special moment in the hot air balloon . Only half a calorie per 60 fluid ounces . It 's addicting . It 's even an aphrodisiac . At the soft drink counter nearest you. ( The doorbell rings . ) CHERYL Who could that be ? DIANE If it 's Les , I 'll kill him . ( CHERYL rises and crosses to the door . She turns on another light . ) BROCK ( Offstage ) Cheryl , it 's me. p. 28 CHERYL Oh My God . It 's Brock . ROXY Really ? BROCK ( Offstage ) Let me in . I 've got a surprise . CHERYL ( Yelling back ) I do n't want a surprise . BROCK I guarantee you 'll like this one . Open up ! SARAH So this is the groom . DIANE Jesus Christ . SARAH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groom the night before . ROXY Hell , let him in . CHERYL ( Yelling to BROCK ) Hang on . ( She unlocks the door . BROCK enters , with a tanktop shirt on , and a bottle of beer in his hand . ) BROCK ( surveying them ) Hi , ladies . ROXY So , you 're Brock . BROCK From a description I heard , you must be Roxy . And you 're Diane . You must be Sarah . SARAH Nice to meet you . BROCK Likewise . You girls having a good time ? CHERYL As a matter of fact , we are Why are you here ? Where 's the great surprise ? p. 29 BROCK I did n't say I had it with me , honey . Did I ? CHERYL No . BROCK But it 's coming . CHERYL When ? BROCK Soon .

ROXY No , I mean , really . Tell us about yourself . What do you do ? How 'd you meet Cheryl ? p. 30 BROCK ( Shyly ) I 'm sure that what I do will sound boring to all of you . I 've heard so much about all your adventures through the years  --  ROXY Enough modesty ! How 'd you meet our girlfriend ? BROCK I was singing in a bar when I spotted her . She always stands out in a crowd . CHERYL Thanks . BROCK I had finished singing one of my originals ROXY You compose ? BROCK Yes . CHERYL He 's good . Country and Western . I could bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'd finished with one of your originals . And ? BROCK She applauded . ROXY And it was love at first clap . CHERYL Brock really is the best for around here . His voice may not be technically perfect , but his lyrics ! The epitome of blues and wailing . ROXY Do you consider yourself gifted ? BROCK I do n't know . ROXY You think you can support Cheryl on a singer 's income ? She 's a woman with very expensive tastes . p. 31 SARAH Roxy , now be civil . Do n't make fun of him . Excuse her . Brock . She 's very open all the time . Saying she 's blunt is an understatement . ROXY I 'm not making fun of him . DIANE No . She 's flirting with him . There 's a vast difference . CHERYL Oh , God . Brock , I wish you had n't come . BROCK Everyone can just settle down . You 'll thank me for this . Believe me . ROXY I 'm glad one of us will thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have I ? ROXY Would it matter if you had ? CHERYL Brock , could I see you alone for a moment ? In the bedroom ? BROCK Sure honey . Whatever you say Excuse me , ladies . ( CHERYL &amp; BROCK exit . ) DIANE You 're up to your old tricks again , Roxy . Testing the groom . ROXY I do n't like him . He 's not good enough for Cheryl . DIANE The hell you do n't . You think he 's good enough for a tumble with you . Want him to make a pass at you the night before they take the vow ? Does that prove you sexual prowess , or what ? p. 32 ROXY I 'm a big threat . Is that it ? SARAH Would you listen to yourselves ? You 'd let your own insecurities ruin this whole affair . DIANE Wedding . ( They pause as CHERYL 'S voice is heard angrily to BROCK , complaining about his presence there . Then , there 's a pause and BROCK and CHERYL re-enter . ) CHERYL I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Interjecting ) Until my surprise comes and fills you with boundless joy . CHERYL I apologize for this strange interruption . BROCK Honey , it 's not your fault . It 's mine . Besides , they will really thank me for this later on . ROXY You think we 'll really like your surprise ? BROCK You 'll love it . SARAH Are n't you supposed to be at a party of your own or something ? ROXY They 're called stag parties . SARAH Oh , God . BROCK Already been there . CHERYL Really ? p. 33 BROCK You know how it is . You seen one , you 've seen them all . CHERYL I was content to be throwing one for us . An all-female stag party . ( The doorbell rings . ) BROCK This could be my surprise now . Pistol , is that you ? ( He shouts through the door . ) PISTOL ( OFFSTAGE ) You bet . BROCK This is just the extra touch your stag party needs , Cheryl . ( To PISTOL : ) Is everything ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at stereo ) No . Just a minute . ( BROCK crosses to stereo and puts on a record BROCK Ready . PISTOL Tell everyone to close their eyes . BROCK Ladies , close your eyes . The surprise is here . CHERYL You do n't have a friend named Pistol . Do you . BROCK Close your eyes , goddamn it ! ROXY I 'll do anything for a surprise . ( She closes her eyes. ) p. 34 DIANE I 'd close my eyes just to meet someone named Pistol . ( SARAH closes her eyes as well . ) BROCK Eyes are closed ! ( He crosses to Cheryl and puts his hands over her eyes . ) PISTOL Start the record over and unlock the door ! BROCK Hell . ( He unlocks the door , jaunts back to the stereo and starts the record again . ) Ready ! Eyes are closed . ( PISTOL enters , wearing only a pair of suspenders and tight , flashy underwear . To the music and lyrics of a current hit song , PISTOL struts , and he dances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sensuous , and he caters to each of the women , snuggling close to them , teasing . CHERYL squeals with delight , ROXY moves with him , DIANE blushes and stays away from him . This lasts for a minute : ) PISTOL ( TO CHERYL ) How do you do ? CHERYL ( Breathy ) Try me . PISTOL I will ( He moves to ROXY ) How about a slow screw ? ROXY I never work fast . PISTOL ( Grinning ) That 's not what I heard . ( He moves to DIANE ) ( DIANE moves away . PISTOL follows her. ) p. 35 PISTOL Hey , what 's your hurry ? ( He catches her and kisses her . ) DIANE The bathroom ( She exits to the bathroom . PISTOL then grabs SARAH in his arms , who moves stiffly . ) ( PISTOL turns back to ROXY and CHERYL . The music runs out . ) PISTOL Well , ladies . My name is Pistol . And I 'm yours for the night , thanks to Mr. Brock Bailey . What shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . CHERYL Jesus Christ . You 're ours for the night ? PISTOL That 's right . They call me the best shot in town , if you get my drift . I 'm always up for a party . I 'm always up period . Who 's first ? CHERYL Jesus Christ . You 're ours for the night ? ROXY ( Punching her ) You just said that . CHERYL Did I ? PISTOL That 's okay . Say it again if you want . I 'm easy . CHERYL ( Eyeing him ) Jesus Christ . ROXY ( Motioning to his body ) How long is " the night " ? p. 36 PISTOL Until the sun rises again or I 'm satisfied . Whichever comes first . CHERYL Do n't you get cold in that ? PISTOL When you 're as hot as I am , you never get cold . And I 'm always hot . ROXY ( Sarcastically ) You have a gorgeous body . PISTOL Thanks . BROCK See ! I told you you 'd love him . PISTOL Who wants to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Laughing hysterically ) Oh , please . CHERYL Just like that ? ROXY We 're not exactly a screw and run crowd , Pistol . PISTOL But this is the night before a wedding . ( He eyes Brock . ) You said they 'd be into this . CHERYL Into this ? What does that mean ? You told him we 'd all love to jump in bed with him ? BROCK I thought you would , for sure . ( DIANE comes out of the bathroom. ) p. 37 DIANE What did you say ? We 're all supposed to make love with him tonight ? But I 'm married . PISTOL So ? BROCK So ? DIANE And I 'm expected to make love with you ? PISTOL Pleasure is my middle name CHERYL ( To BROCK ) Where the hell did you find him ? ( BROCK shrugs ) PISTOL You can do with me what you wish . DIANE And if I wish to do nothing ? ROXY What a waste ! ( In a fit of laughing hysteria , ROXY and SARAH collapse against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody was in one big bed together . You 're the originator of the Big Bang Theory . PISTOL Really ? Let 's see . CHERYL Okay , Brock . The joke has gone far enough . You two can leave now . It was funny . It was cute . You got to meet all of them before the ceremony . And now you can go . BROCK I wo n't make him leave . You love him . CHERYL Do n't you see what you 've done ? All I wanted was to spend one last time with these women , one last night . And now there 's you . And Pistol . p. 38 PISTOL ( Crossing to the door to exit ) Well , it 's your party . You 're the one who 's tying the knot . Not me.So , I 'll go . I know when I 'm not wanted . I 've been paid . I 'll hit the road . DIANE Do n't be so dramatic . PISTOL This takes real effort . Did you know that , lady ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her and kisses her . ) DIANE Stop that . PISTOL You 're kind of intriguing . CHERYL Leave her alone ! PISTOL Shyness always attracts me . ( To CHERYL ) I 'm glad to have the chance to meet the lady my best friend is going to marry before the ceremony . It 's not often that my job and personal life coincide like this , although I often mix business with pleasure . I 'm going to be the best man tomorrow , in your wedding . Diverse , do n't you think ? You 'll be amazed how pristine I really am . CHERYL Diverse ? No . More like perverse . BROCK Ca n't you take a little fun ? A last fling ? I wanted you to meet my best friend ! CHERYL ( Pointing to the door ) Go . p. 39 BROCK No . CHERYL Either you get out or I will . BROCK Oh , come on . CHERYL I mean it . Take this trash and split . BROCK Calm down . Jesus Christ . ( CHERYL grabs a jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , DIANE , and ROXY . She exits out the front door . ) BROCK What the hell happened ? SARAH You do n't know much about Cheryl . That 's obvious . ( She crosses to the door and exits after CHERYL . ) ROXY That , Brock , was a fight . A lover 's quarrel . PISTOL ( to DIANE ) Dance with me . I do n't have anyone to dance with . ( He starts the music again . ) DIANE No . I ca n't . Especially after what just happened . PISTOL Why not ? DIANE It 's not right . PISTOL Nothing 's right , lady . Come on . ( He grabs her and starts to dance . ) DIANE I 'm not that type of person . Christ , Cheryl just left . Do n't you realize that , Brock ? p. 40 PISTOL Come here . ( He grags her into the hall , out of sight . ) We 'll start out easy . DIANE I do n't really want to . I 'm not that type of person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosens up . ) Christ , you 're funny ! ( The two of them cross up to the right hall , sometimes crossing in and out of view of the audience , most times out . However , they continue to ad-lib , so that their presence is felt . It is not hostile  --  it becomes fun . ) ROXY ( To BROCK ) Are you in love with her ? BROCK Why ? ROXY I love her fiercely . I would lay down my life for her . Are you in love ? BROCK Sure . ROXY You 'd better sound more convincing than that . BROCK Yeah ? ROXY Yes . I 'm one of her best friends for life . You 'd better try to make nice with me . BROCK Okay . ROXY You should be out there looking for her . BROCK How can she be that mad ? I hope she 'll be right back . p. 41 ROXY You 're not even worried . BROCK I 'm pretty scared . ROXY Scared ? Or is it you do n't care ? BROCK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't love her . You do n't care about her . She 's rich , well-educated . She applauded . You proposed . BROCK It did n't happen that fast  --  ROXY You 're trying to use her . BROCK ( Incredulous ) For what ? ROXY ( Looking at him ) What to dance ? BROCK You and me ? ROXY Sure . Why not ? BROCK I 'm nervous . ROXY Dance with me . BROCK You do n't scare me . But I do n't trust you . ROXY I do n't trust you either . Come on . ( She pulls him off the couch and they start dancing . DIANE and PISTOL eye the two of them . ) You have nice eyes . BROCK Thanks . ROXY Loosen up . You can be loose with me. p. 42 BROCK Okay . ( He clings to her tightly ) ROXY That 's tighter . BROCK ( Trying to relax ) Sorry . ROXY Will you cherish Cheryl ? BROCK What ? ROXY When you marry her will you cherish her ? There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dote on her . BROCK I guess . ROXY ( Sarcastically ) Do n't talk so much . ( She stops dancing and tries to kiss him . ) BROCK Do n't . ROXY It 's what you want , is n't it ? BROCK No . ROXY You 're not married yet . BROCK It 's not what I want . ROXY I 'm not very patient . You 're supposed to be friendly . BROCK ( Fighting back , straining ) You 're not really in a movie with John Travolta . ROXY ( Amused by this ) No ? p. 43 BROCK No . ROXY And you 're not much of a singer . BROCK Very good . How can you tell ? ROXY You 've got no breath control . BROCK You 're right . Singing is just one of my hobbies . Actually what I do is very boring compared to all of you . I thought that maybe Cheryl would have told you already . I guess she has n't had the time . But whenever I tell someone what I do for a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about it . ROXY You mean you 're not a singer ? BROCK It 's a creative hobby . ( DIANE crosses over to them . ) DIANE You 're in here hugging . She 's out there drinking or roaming the streets . And we 're supposed to be in a wedding tomorrow . Does anyone know about the color scheme ? Is there one ? BROCK No . There 's no color scheme . Do n't worry , Diane . DIANE Somebody had better worry about something . ( The phone rings . ) Maybe that 's Cheryl . ( PISTOL crosses to answer it . ) PISTOL ( On phone ) Hello . Who ? Yeah , she 's here No shit ? Just a minute . ( To DIANE. ) p. 44 DIANE ( Taking phone ) Hello ? What ? Again ? No , I do n't think it 's serious . She 's probably just missing me and combined with what she ate for dinner No , absolutely not . Ca n't you handle this by yourself ? ( A pause . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take her to the emergency ward . Yeah , why do n't you ? Because kids throw up whenever they 've eaten something bad . I do n't think it 's serious . It just sounds like bad food . I am not being negligent . How dare you say that ? Do n't you dare say that again ! ( She hands the receiver to PISTOL who slams the phone as he hangs it up . ) PISTOL Are you going home now ? DIANE Are you crazy ? I 've been gone one day . He ca n't even manage to feed Chrissy right . PISTOL How about going out with me , to forget about it ? We 'll dance a little more . We 'll find a festive environment , something that will make you forget the word " husband " . A little vacation . ( After a pause , DIANE looks at the phone and back at PISTOL . ) DIANE All right , fine . I think I will . We can look for Cheryl . I 'm sure she went to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a hold of us , we 'll be at the club on 17th Street . p. 45 BROCK I know where that is . You sure learn quick , Pistol . You find the hot spots in town within a day , do n't you . PISTOL Right . ( PISTOL and DIANE exit . ) ROXY So . BROCK Can you believe that ? ROXY What ? BROCK The two of them hitting it off like that . ROXY It was mutual consent , that 's all . BROCK Now we 're alone . ROXY Yeah . Frightened ? BROCK No . ROXY You should be . Have n't you heard the stories ? Did n't you hear what happened the night before Diane 's wedding ? BROCK Yeah . So ? I 'm not Les . ROXY I wanted him gone . Because he was n't good enough for Diane . He did n't deserve her . And I wanted him gone . Do you believe that ? BROCK ( Very uneasy ) Uh , sure . ROXY And I do n't want you to marry Cheryl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know what I think ? p. 46 ROXY What ? BROCK I think you 're jealous . ROXY No . BROCK Come on . Admit it . You think things are going to change or something . I understand , Roxy . But things wo n't change . Cheryl will be the same friend to you that she 's always been . ROXY Would you come into the bedroom with me for a minute . I dropped my suitcase against the bed and it 's stuck . I ca n't pull it out . Do you think you could help me , for just a minute ? BROCK I should look for Cheryl , I guess . ROXY Right . We will . Just help me pull it out . BROCK I 've never heard of anyone getting a suitcase stuck under a bed before . ROXY You 've never met me before , either . Come on . Be a gentlemen . Cheryl would want you to be gallant . BROCK Well , okay . ( The two of them exit , into the bedroom . ROXY turns out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As they enter the bedroom , the door shuts . Soon , the phone begins to ring . It rings , and rings and rings . Suddenly , the front door is opened by the key . SARAH and CHERYL enter the room . The phone continues to ring . SARAH and CHERYL both giggle . Finally , the phone stops ringing . CHERYL gets to the receiver , and upon hearing the dial tone , drops the receiver back into the cradle. ) p. 47 CHERYL ( Giggling ) No one home . ( She smiles . ) Thanks for coming after me , Sarah . I know I got too angry about it . I 'm on edge , you know . You 've never met him , and then he shows up here with a male dancer , this man who is his best friend ? I should have rejoiced that he displayed some personality , I guess . But it cheapened things . Here I am in the middle of the rites of passage , or something , and some twerp shows up stripping . Where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out looking for you . CHERYL Well , what should we do now ? SARAH Let 's play another game . Just the two of us . CHERYL Okay . We 're the only real gamesters anyway . None of them would play . SARAH Let 's play , ask the bride any question . CHERYL How do you play that ? SARAH You and I can ask the bride any question we want . CHERYL But I am the bride . SARAH So ? CHERYL So I ask me a question ? SARAH Yes . p. 48 CHERYL Then what do I need you for ? SARAH For keeping track of whose turn it is . I ask , then you ask . I ask , then you . If I did n't play , you might miss a turn , in all the confusion . CHERYL I see what you mean . Okay , who goes first ? SARAH You do . CHERYL Do we stand or what ? SARAH The bride must always stand , when answering . CHERYL Got it . Ready ? SARAH Ready . CHERYL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color pink as the dominant color in the ceremony ? ( She stands , and answers in her own voice : ) Because , I like it . ( She sits down . ) Hey , what a great game . Who 's ahead ? SARAH There 's no score . It 's only for our information . Ready ? CHERYL Shoot . SARAH Are you in love ? CHERYL ( Standing ) Maybe . If there is such a thing . SARAH Then why are you going through with this ? If it 's only maybe . p. 49 CHERYL ( Sitting ) Only one question per turn . If you speak out of place , you 'll lose your next turn . Ready ? ( SARAH nods . CHERYL asks in false voice : ) How long do you expect this marriage to last ? ( She stands , and uses her own voice : ) Not long . ( She sits down . ) Your turn . SARAH Why do n't you expect it to last ? CHERYL ( Standing up ) Because I ' too scared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? CHERYL Out of turn . You ignored your first warning ! You lose your next turn . I go again . ( In false voice : ) Is he good in bed ? She stands , and uses real voice : ) Fantastic . ( Suddenly , a noise is heard , against the wall . SARAH &amp; CHERYL look at each other . SARAH What the hell is that ? CHERYL Evidently we 're not alone . Someone 's in the bedroom . I 'll go see . SARAH ( Rising to stop her ) No . No . Wait here . I 'll go see . ( SARAH exits to the bedroom , we hear her open the door , and come back with a pale face . The noise stops. ) p. 50 CHERYL Who is it ? SARAH You wo n't believe it . CHERYL Yes , I will . Who is it ? Roxy and Pistol ? SARAH No . No . CHERYL Go on , tell me then . Who is it ? SARAH ( Sitting down . ) It 's Diane and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pistol . CHERYL Oh , no . Really ? SARAH Can you believe it ? Maybe we should leave you know , so they have some privacy . CHERYL Diane and Pistol ? I thought Diane was happily married , to the man of everyone 's dreams the world 's best mother SARAH The man of her dreams would n't have made her give up sociology . CHERYL True . Were they having a good time ? Did they see you ? SARAH Yeah . Let 's go out to a bar , or somewhere . A drive-in movie , maybe ? CHERYL Were they embarassed ? Did you blush ? SARAH Yes . Now let 's get the hell out of here . CHERYL They sure must be having a good time . p. 51 SARAH Yeah . Please , can we go now ? This makes me terribly nervous . CHERYL I can see . SARAH Let 's just take a walk down your old street . ( The doorbell rings . ) SARAH ( Crossing in front of her . ) Let me answer it . Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't want you hung over at the ceremony . CHERYL This is my apartment for one more night . I 'll get the door . ( CHERYL crosses to the door and opens it . PISTOL and DIANE walk in . ) DIANE Sarah , Cheryl , you 're back ! SARAH Yes . DIANE We just went out to look for you , and I realized that it 's not so proper for me to be out alone with Pistol here . You know , what if Les found out So , we came back to ask Brock and Roxy if they would come , too . Where are they ? ( She looks around . ) I guess they left already . ( PISTOL shrugs . ) CHERYL ( To SARAH ) You said they were in the bedroom . ( She indicates PISTOL and DIANE . ) PISTOL Where are the other two ? Pixie and Rock ? p. 52 CHERYL Where are the other two ? I 'll tell you where the other two are in the bedroom , going at it like apes . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of here . PISTOL Got ta split , Diane . SARAH Well , I do n't know what they were doing . Roxy was in her underwear . He was kneeling on the floor . DIANE ( To CHERYL ) You 're the one who invited her here , and then left them alone . What did you expect ? CHERYL The man I 'm going to marry is in bed with my best friend . ( She crosses to the door . ) I think I need to go somewhere . Alone . And you can tell Brock that the whole thing is off ! ( CHERYL exits . ) DIANE Should we go with her ? She sounded  --  SARAH ( Stupified ) I ca n't believe this.How embarassing ! I ca n't believe Roxy ! DIANE Should one of us tell Brock ? It 's not like Cheryl to do anything rash , but  --  SARAH I do n't know . I do n't know proper etiquette in these situations It 's never smooth , is it ? Why do people even bother ? PISTOL I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . ' Course when Brock hired me , I should have been a bit suspicious . He 's not too normal . But then , who is normal ? p. 53 SARAH ( In agreement ) Who is . PISTOL You like to dance ? SARAH We 're talking about Cheryl , now . ( DIANE crosses to the couch and sits . ) PISTOL The only thing to do is sit and wait . DIANE He may have a point . PISTOL I know about these lover 's spats . She 'll go outside , cry , and come back in ready to forgive him , this one last fling , before he 's tied the big knot . She 'll decide that it 's better that he did it tonight than after the ceremony . She may not ever speak to Roxy again , but I do n't know if that 's any great loss . Cheryl will be fine . We 'll wait up for her . So come on , Let 's dance . We 're in the mere shank of the evening . ( PISTOL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) PISTOL Come on , Diane . DIANE All three of us ? SARAH At the slumber parties we used to have , we 'd always dance with each other . Girls dancing with girls . You know ? PISTOL ( Taking both of them in arm ) Come on . Just one song . DIANE ( Sadly ) Just one . p. 54 SARAH ( Echoing ) Just one song . ( PISTOL breaks into a wild dance routine , SARAH and DIANE watch for a moment . Then , they join in . ) ( PISTOL , SARAH , and DIANE dance until the lights begin to fade slowly on the three of them. ) @x ( AT RISE : The next morning , about 9:00 a.m . In the same living room , we see DIANE sleeping next to PISTOL on the floor , and SARAH sleeping on the couch . PISTOL snores lightly . The telephone starts to ring . No one moves . The phone rings again . Slowly , SARAH is aroused . The phone rings again . SARAH gets up , and stepping over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) SARAH ( Answering phone ) Hello ? Who ? Roxy ? She 's asleep right now . Can I take a message ? Well , yes , as a matter of fact I am a receptionist , mister . Who the hell are you ? Do n't you know it 's the middle of the night ? Okay , okay , so it 's nine o'clock , that 's the middle of the night to me . What 's so funny ? ( ROXY enters , dressed in the same clothes as the night before , disheveled . ) ROXY ( Yawning ) Did I hear my name ? Is it for me ? SARAH ( Covering phone ) Yes , it 's some man named Mike ROXY ( Panicked ) Oh , no . I do n't want to talk to him SARAH ( Still covering phone ) What do I say ? ROXY He 's a real jerk ! I ca n't believe he 'd call me here . Damn ! p. 56 SARAH ( Still covering phone ) Shall I say you 're not here ? DIANE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , it 's for Roxy . I 'm going to tell him to get lost ROXY ( Reaching a decision ) No , wait . ( She takes the phone , and with a great sweetness in her voice says : ) Hello ? Mike honey , how are you ? I 'm fine . No , no . I 've been up for hours . I 'm having the best time Of course I miss you , honey DIANE ( Wide awake , stunned ) Mike who ? SARAH I do n't know . Jesus , did Cheryl come home ? DIANE Have n't seen her . ( ROXY motions for them to be quiet ) ROXY Mike , I 'm sorry you 're lonely . You 'll just have to sleep without me . We 're having the best time . SARAH Pistol 's snoring is driving me nuts . Pistol ? ( She crosses to him . ) PISTOL Huh ? SARAH There 's a bed free . Go on into the bedroom . ( She nudges him . PISTOL slowly rises and crosses out in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did Cheryl ? Is the ceremony ? ( He stops . ) DIANE We 'll wake you when we know . ( PISTOL nods and exits . ) ROXY ( Loudly ) A diamond ring ? Mike , I just could n't You ca n't bribe me to come back early . They have n't even gone through the ceremony yet Okay , I love you , too . Bye-bye . What ? Yes , I really love you , too Bye . ( She hangs up , and seeing their reactions to her conversation turns away . ) DIANE You love Mike ? It could n't be true I must be dreaming . ( She pinches herself . ) Roxy in love ? Roxy , who the hell was that ? ROXY ( Shyly ) Nobody . SARAH Oh , come on . I 've never heard you talk like that to a man . Who 's Mike ? ROXY ( Lighting a cigarette ) He 's this real jerk , a real ass-hole . A womanizer . You know the type , not worth talking about . Tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DIANE He 's giving you a diamond ring ? ROXY It 's nothing , really . p. 58 SARAH If he 's such a jerk , why 'd he giving you a diamond ring ? ROXY It 's so stupid . I hate to talk about it . SARAH Buying you off ? DIANE You 're not having another affair , are you ? ROXY No , it 's much worse than that . He 's asked me to marry him . ( DIANE and SARAH look surprised . ) ROXY But do n't worry . I 'm not about to . Male/female love is so obnoxious . I 'm not about to succumb to anything so frivolous . DIANE Roxy , I think it would be wonderful . It 's just what you need . Roxy and Mike ! It has a nice ring to it . What 's his last name ? ROXY ( Grimacing ) Rosetti . SARAH Roxy Rosetti ? Then you 'd really be in with Travolta . ROXY Look , let 's just drop it , okay ? I do n't want to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right ? DIANE I guess this explains a few things . You slept with Brock to make it harder on yourself because you do n't want to be in love , with this Mike Spaghetti fellow . ROXY ( Surprised ) What ? You thought Brock and I.We did n't do anything . I was so tired , I just fell asleep . I kept waiting for one of you to come get me. p. 59 DIANE ( Smirking ) You 're so immoral , Roxy . You 'd screw anything that was over five inches long , would n't you ? ROXY No , six . SARAH Want some toast ? DIANE You 've got no conscience . ROXY You 're jealous of that , are n't you ? DIANE No , I 'm appalled by it . Thanks to you , there might not be any ceremony today . You tried to do the same thing to me , with Les . Why do we tolerate this ? ROXY I 've been loyal We did n't do anything ! You all went out , he was waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we live for it . Vicariously , we live for Roxy 's sins . ROXY That 's sick . DIANE Cheryl has not come home . ROXY Since when ? SARAH We have n't seen her since last night . ROXY Well , why the hell did n't you tell me ? Have you called the police ? DIANE Did n't you think this was going to upset her ? Some people have emotions . Some people can feel pain . Pain is knowing your best friend is in bed with your husband to be ! p. 60 ROXY Oh , really ? DIANE Pain is looking at you and seeing what you 've become . ROXY We did n't do anything in there , I tell you ! He could n't . And I could n't . I dropped my suitcase , he picked it up . Boring stuff . DIANE You expect us to believe that ? Then why 'd it take him so long to leave ? He was in the bedroom long enough . ROXY Embarassed , I guess . All we did was talk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had V.D. or something ? SARAH Diane , if Roxy says nothing happened , then maybe nothing happened . DIANE She 'll never change . She was always hopping from bed to bed . ROXY I get by . I do n't need your pity . Or your moralizing . SARAH Do n't go into this . We should be looking for Cheryl . DIANE Why ? So she can hear this big lie , too ? You 're an actress , Roxy . I 'm sure you think you can fool all of us . But it 's not that easy for those who know you , the way we do , to buy your innocent act . ROXY ( Quietly ) I 'm not working with John Travolta. p. 61 SARAH What ? ROXY I 'm not working with anyone big yet . And do you want to know why , Diane ? ( She laughs sadly . ) You 're not going to understand this . The paradox will be too much for you . SARAH Why are n't you working with someone big ? ROXY Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't put out for it . I know you see me as a thirty year-old nymphomaniac who has no scruples . But you see , I am trying to change that . Really . Somehow . I just did n't know where to start exactly . DIANE Christ . ROXY You want to know how I changed ? In the early years , I would just go to interviews like everyone else , you know . But the years go by , and you have to do things that you did n't want to think about doing SARAH Modeling lingerie ? ROXY First they ask me to dance . I 'm wearing a nice dress , high heels . I dance . They like it . A man with sunglasses says " Nice . Would you take off your dress , please ? We 'd like to see how you look in your bra and underwear . " Just like that . I flinch . But I take off the dress . I keep on the high heels . I dance . The man says " We 'd like to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I dance . I dance like I 'd never danced , with such style , Diane . The songs ends , and the man says " Thank you very much . You 're not quite what we 're looking for . We needed a red-head . But hey , we 'll keep your picture and resume for future productions . " I gather my clothes , and as I 'm leaving , another man comes up to me , guaranteeing me $200 a night to work in a strip joint . p. 62 SARAH But you do n't . You do n't work in a place like that . ROXY And another man offers to use me if only I 'll spend the night with him . That 's all . One night . And I look him right in the eye and say , " You 've seen my body , mister . But you 'll never see anything else of mine . " DIANE Why do you put yourself through that ? ROXY It 's the choice I 've made , Diane . Do n't talk to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then starts to gather her things . ) SARAH What are you doing ? DIANE I 'm leaving . I do n't belong here . I should be with my little girl . SARAH But the ceremony is n't for a few more hours . And then the reception . DIANE Wedding ? This is n't a wedding . This is someone 's idea of a horrible , awful nightmare . Getting us all together again under the pretense of some kind of celebration . Something we could all experience together . I 'm going home where it 's safe . It 's not safe here . ( She continues to pack . ) ROXY We were your friends , but we 're just too horrible now , is that it ? DIANE No . That 's not it at all . You see , I have this person called a husband that I resent a hell of a lot of the time . I resent him , I love him , I resent him . You know ? I think it 's so much better somewhere else . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and living off her parents ' money . Sure , she wore overalls when we were growing up , but she always had the money . Yes , her MG would break down ; she did need friends to rescue her , but she had a way out . Sarah , who could always see the bright side of things , could get a job , could always make us laugh , she had a way out . She could make her own way ; she was the epitome of independence . And Roxy , we all know that you could screw your way out of anything . And I think , even though that bothers you , because your intellect leaves you laden with guilt , I think you 'll always get jobs because you 're pretty . You had a way out . But what did I have ? What was I going to do ? I was dependent , could n't spell Herpes Simplex II , and was introverted . So I got married , and have felt like a failure ever since . But I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself than I have in 8 years . Because at least I have something . I have a child , I have a husband . And I 'll never belittle it again . I thank you all for that . I thank Cheryl for that . p. 63 SARAH You sound elitist , condescending . DIANE I do n't mean to be , really . I do n't mean to like to drink coffee . I do n't mean to find doing the laundry therapeutic . I do n't mean to have to leave you . It 's just the way things are . Fair is fair . ROXY We never judged it as a stigma , your marriage . We always admired you for it . DIANE It does n't really matter now , does it ? I have Les . I guess that 's what love is . And I 'm not going to take it for granted again . Because at least I know , I can count on , I can depend on what he will do . He 's not going to break out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . That was the last of it , Roxy . ( PISTOL re-enters , in a long shirt over his shorts . ) PISTOL How am I supposed to sleep with all this brou-ha-ha ? What the hell are you shouting about ? Has Cheryl come back ? ( He squints . ) DIANE No . We 're all nuts . You were right , Sarah . It 's not safe here . PISTOL You are so paranoid ! DIANE Before I leave , I demand to know your real name . You in the shorts . What is your real name ? PISTOL Me ? p. 64 DIANE You see anybody else in shorts ? PISTOL Fred . ( DIANE stops and suddenly starts to break into hysterical laughter . ROXY and SARAH look at each other and do the same . ) DIANE Fred ? You ? Really named Fred ? PISTOL ( Defensively ) Yes . Fred . DIANE ( Still laughing ) Can you figure that ? He 's this hunk of a man named Fred ? Him ? A " Fred " ? SARAH I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ROXY Fred Flintstone Not anyone that looks like him ! PISTOL Now watch it , girls . I 'm feeling plenty woozy . SARAH What do you mean , woozy ? PISTOL I mean dizzy . I mean like I could throw up right here on the carpet . DIANE Then quit eating for Christ 's sake . ( She pulls him away from the candy . ) PISTOL I thought you were leaving . DIANE I am . I do n't think there 's going to be a wedding today . p. 65 PISTOL Do n't leave . DIANE Stay here with you ? Sounds eventful . Worthwhile . ( She finishes packing her bag . ) I ca n't stay . Do n't you understand ? I ca n't . PISTOL Let me get dressed and take you to the airport . DIANE ( Grabbing her coat ) I drove myself . SARAH You 're not going to wait for Cheryl ? DIANE I 'll call her or something . ( She pauses . ) Sure , that 's what I 'll do . Hey Roxy , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain . You 've never had a tiny , little infant at your breast , depending on your every move , every day , every hour . You 've never walked a child all night with colic , or watched over measles . Let 's not ever talk about pain . Fred , good luck . Roxy , Sarah , see you at your weddings . SARAH I do n't know if Roxy and I well , I hope we see you before then . ROXY I ca n't believe you 're just leaving . Just walking out . DIANE Sorry . PISTOL Look , if anyone should be leaving , it 's me . I guess I 'm finished here . SARAH That 's the understatement of the year . p. 66 PISTOL I mean , you should consider how I feel . Here I am , Brock 's best friend that he calls up to be in the wedding , and for a laugh asks me to do this ( He motions to his shorts . ) And it backfires in his face . I 'm so drunk I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deserted ? So if anyone should feel left out , out of touch with a friend , it 's me , right ? But do you see me leaving ? No way . DIANE Why ? PISTOL Because I know that things change . And to be a good friend , you have to change with them . Brock and me , we go back a hell of a long way . Little league in Cleveland . Christ , imagine me on a baseball field in Ohio ROXY That 's almost obscene . PISTOL So I 'll stick this out . What are friends for . ROXY How 'd you get into ( She motions to his shorts ) this ? PISTOL Well , I used to work in a supermarket , in produce . And I thought that 's what life was all about . ROXY Come on ( She laughs . ) PISTOL ( Adamant ) I thought that 's what life was  --  fresh food , coming in on trucks every day . People lining up , with metal carts , stuffing their faces , greenery in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabulous to me . But something happened . I 'm not sure what . But I began to be hit in the face with it . Literally . The tomatoes were not falling on the floor because I 'd stacked them wrong . People threw them on the floor . Just threw them there . The bananas , dripping and oozing all over the wooden trays People were stabbing them as they walked by . The luscious peaches , when in season , would fill the aisles with sweetness , were being stolen , by people with brown bags stuffed in their purses . I know what you 're thinking . You 're thinking I 'm a food maniac . It 's not true . When you catch people tearing up the spinach , and spitting on the artichokes , what would that say to you ? It 's different when you catch someone eating off the aisle . That 's okay . You can understand that , ca n't you ? But the carrots being walked on , and the lettuce , the innocent lettuce withering before your very eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the alfalfa sprouts get stringy , you know it 's going to be a bad day . The rotten food , it began to get so smelly and messy . You know , depressing . p. 67 ROXY And so  --  PISTOL This seemed to be the answer . ( He motions to his clothes . ) ( DIANE drops her bags , and crosses to the phone . She starts to dial the police . ) DIANE ( Into phone ) Hello , police ? I 'd like to report a missing person . SARAH ( Crossing to PISTOL ) Thanks . ( She nods to DIANE . ) PISTOL Sure . ROXY I think she 's being her old assertive self again . DIANE The name ? Miss Cheryl Fournay . ( She puts her hands over the phone and says to all of them : ) This is what we should have done in the first place . ( She then turns her voice back into the phone , speaking to the police . ) That 's right . F-O-U-R-N-A-Y . Age : 30 . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide , she was supposed to get married today . She came home angry after a lover 's quarrel and thought she saw her best friend in bed with her fiance . ( Pause . ) I do n't know how she thought she saw them . Yes , I know , they either were or they were n't . Anyway , that 's a minor point at the moment . We have n't seen her since ten o'clock last night . Officer , it 's her wedding day . We 're her bridesmaids , for Christ 's sake , she would n't just have left us here . We flew in from all over the country for this . Yeah , right . We 'll be down . What 's the address ? ( She starts scribbling on a piece of paper near the phone . ) My name ? Mrs. Diane Read . The number is 776-5771 . Fine . Thanks . ( She hangs up the phone. ) p. 68 SARAH Well ? DIANE We have to go down to headquarters to report this " kind of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone . PISTOL Who do they think they are ? How inconvenient . DIANE Well , come on . Let 's get dressed , and go . Something awful might have happened . We 've been so cavalier about this . SARAH ( Crossing to bedroom ) I 'll just throw on a shirt that 's decent . DIANE One of us should stay in case she shows up here . ROXY I 'll stay . DIANE Fine . Pistol , you 're coming , as a witness to the whole thing , and on behalf of the groom . SARAH Speaking of the groom , should n't someone notify him ? PISTOL Of what ? SARAH This disappearance ! ( She exits . ) ROXY I 'll call him . Give me his number , Pistol . PISTOL It 's in the phone book under Bailey . Brock Bailey . 473- ( He falters ) blah , blah , blah , blah . ROXY Thanks . I 'll look it up . p. 69 DIANE Your pants , Pistol . PISTOL At night , they want your clothes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . ( He exits , to the bedroom . ) ( DIANE starts brushing off her clothes , as ROXY stares at her . ) ROXY Di . DIANE Yes ? ROXY I 'm glad you 're staying . We need you . DIANE I know . Sarah 's standing around hungover , a male dancer is telling food stories , and you 're so busy staying nailed to your cross that nothing would get done around here , if I did n't stay . Cheryl could be dead and you three would n't catch on until Halloween . ROXY ( Very awkwardly ) I mean , we still need you each other . You 're reacting one way , because you feel that we think of you differently , because you got married and we did n't . And I 'm reacting another way , because I feel that all of you think I should be famous and glamorous now We 're so busy compensating for what we 're not that we ca n't be ourselves . DIANE ( Quietly ) If Les calls  --  ROXY I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take a message . ROXY Right . ( SARAH and PISTOL re-enter . PISTOL has on a weird pair of pants , obviously not his , as if dug out of a closet , and SARAH has on a different shirt . ) SARAH Let 's go . ( PISTOL and DIANE cross to the door . SARAH turns to ROXY . ) SARAH You know where Cheryl keeps the phone book ? ROXY Kitchen . SARAH You 'll be okay ? ROXY Hurry down there , for Christ 's sake . ( PISTOL , DIANE , and SARAH exit . ROXY sits for a few seconds , looking around . Slowly she starts to pick up a few bits of trash . Then , she crosses to the telephone , and dials " Information . " ) ROXY ( Into phone ) Could I have the number of a " Brock Bailey " ? Thanks . ( The door starts to open , quietly , behind ROXY . CHERYL sneaks in . ) ROXY That 's right . Brock . Sure . ( She scribbles. ) 473-2437 . Thanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to consider how to approach this phone call . She sees CHERYL . CHERYL stares at her. ) p. 71 ROXY ( After the pause ) You 're back ! You 're safe ! CHERYL ( Coldly ) Calling Brock ? I thought you 'd probably gone home with him by now . ROXY I was just going to call him and tell him you 'd been gone . I did n't even know , Cheryl , until this morning . ( She crosses to hug her . ) Thank God you 're okay ! CHERYL ( Pulling away ) I waited until I saw them leave . I thought this place was deserted . ROXY Are you mad ? CHERYL Are you stupid ? Of course I 'm mad . I did n't think you 'd do it to me , dear . That 's all . You and Diane were a different matter , it was a different time . But I did n't think you 'd do it to me . ROXY What ? CHERYL Your coy act . Charming . ROXY I did n't sleep with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You were playing backgammon . I just came back to get some things . I 'm going to go away for awhile . I 'm sorry you came all this way for a wedding , but I 'm sure you 're leaving much happier . ROXY We did n't do anything ! Ask him ! ! p. 72 CHERYL I hope I never see him again in my life . ROXY Good . He 's not good enough for you . Too shy . CHERYL How do you know ? ROXY You want to spend the rest of your life with him ? CHERYL It was at least a possibility until you came to town . I do n't know what it is about you . Your presence just spells disaster . I 've known more couples to break up because of you , you know , in the old days We always thought it was your inherent sexiness , or something . Your volcano of sexuality that you could n't keep from exploding . But it never was . It was just you , was n't it , Roxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into something you never had  --  a reliable relationship with a man . ROXY They 're all so stupid , when it comes down to it , Cheryl . I thought you knew that better than anyone . I 'm saving you grief . Nobody in their right mind would go prancing down the aisle with some guy to take wedding vows . Have you seen the statistics on divorce lately . Ever soaring . And what do we know about this guy ? Absolutely nothing . He sings ? Christ , what 's a friend supposed to do but save you from disaster . CHERYL I told you I loved him . Was n't that enough ? ROXY No . It was a bad sign . Marriage should only transpire these days for money . p. 73 CHERYL Roxy ! ROXY If you wanted to try it for just a little while , I could understand , as a sort of old-fashioned experiment , but to say you 're actually in love with the guy  --  ( These next lines are spoken quickly : ) CHERYL You did n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even kiss ? ROXY Well  --  CHERYL There was a loud bang  --  ROXY That was my nickname in college  --  CHERYL I heard a loud noise  --  ROXY I dropped my suitcase  --  CHERYL Against the wall ? ROXY It ricochetted  --  CHERYL And then what ? ROXY I fell asleep . CHERYL World War Three was happening in the living room and you fell asleep ? ROXY I have jet lag from L.A CHERYL Roxy  --  p. 74 ROXY I was tired ! CHERYL Quit lying ! ROXY Okay ! I wanted to see what he would do . I was testing him . I did n't want you to marry anyone who would deign to make a pass at me ! CHERYL God . I do n't believe it . I thought you would have outgrown this by now . ROXY I do n't want to give you up . Cheryl , I 'm watching us degenerate like rotting garbage . Look at us . We had all the dreams , all the aspirations . And now , what are we doing ? You 're getting married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm a waitress . CHERYL Waitress ? ROXY Sometimes . Between jobs . I audition for Travolta movies , Cheryl . But nobody casts those , really . We were n't supposed to turn out this way . CHERYL How were we supposed to turn out ? ROXY ( Shaking her head ) Better . CHERYL There 's still hope . We got most of our lives ahead , Roxy . We do n't reach our sexual peak for twenty years . ROXY Yeah , but then there 's menopause . CHERYL Ugh . p. 75 ROXY Right . Ugh . I just do n't understand why you 're going through with this . You never wanted to get married . You never talked about it . We even made a bet , Cheryl , about who would still be an old maid in their seventies ! CHERYL I rediscovered romance . ROXY With him ? CHERYL Yes . ROXY Then why 'd you make all of us come ? CHERYL To share in it . To lead the toasts . To say " Bon Voyage " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun things on a wedding day . ROXY Decorate the car  --  CHERYL Witness  --  ROXY Cry  --  CHERYL Give gifts  --  ROXY Weddings are a mess . CHERYL You 're supposed to be happy for me . ROXY ( Shaking her head ) This is the last slumber party I 'll ever go to . CHERYL Trust me a little , would you ? Do you think I 'd just get married for no reason ? Because I have nothing else to do ? p. 76 ROXY Why then ? CHERYL Because I found someone that I loved enough to have a family with , to be normal with . Is that such a weak thought ? Having a family ? Can you really call that giving up ? ROXY It 's so traditional . It 's so simple . CHERYL This is not simple . ROXY Are you still going to go through with it ? CHERYL You 've been such a big help . ROXY Are you still going to marry him ? CHERYL I 'll have to talk to him . ROXY Are n't you scared ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diane was different , she had always wanted to . But you had never mentioned it . And I had never even thought about it . Until now . CHERYL What do you mean ? ROXY I had planned to go through life alone . CHERYL And now ? ROXY This is very embarassing . CHERYL What the hell are you talking about ? ROXY Someone 's asked me to marry him . It 's my first offer . p. 77 CHERYL Who ? ROXY This jerk . This tall , rich , intelligent , handsome womanizer . CHERYL Roxy , that 's wonderful ! You sound like you really love him ! ROXY I sound like I love him ? I called him a jerk . CHERYL " Tall , rich , handsome , intelligent , sensitive " ROXY Yes , he is sensitive . CHERYL What 's his name ? How 'd you meet him ? ROXY His name is Mike Rosetti . I met him at an interview . CHERYL Another actor ? ROXY Director . Look , I really do n't want to talk about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHERYL Yes . ROXY Ah , hell . If you can admit it , then so can I. It 's so old-fashioned . I hate to say it . I mean , nobody is in love anymore . CHERYL We are . There 's nothing wrong with it . Why are you so nervous about saying it ? ROXY I just hate marriage . p. 78 CHERYL No . You just hate divorce . ( There 's a pause . ) ROXY Yes . I guess I do . CHERYL I 'll come be in your wedding ! ROXY Marriage is so out of style . CHERYL You 've always been trendy , I understand . But there comes a time when you 've got to be able to do what you want to do , Roxy . Not because others approve or disapprove . But because it makes you happy . ROXY Yes . ( There 's a knocking at the door . ROXY looks at CHERYL . ) ROXY Should I get it ? CHERYL If it 's Brock  --  ROXY You 'd better see him . CHERYL I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything  --  CHERYL But maybe he wanted to  --  ROXY No ! I forced him into everything  --  CHERYL You said nothing happened ! ROXY That 's what I meant . You get the door . You two need to be alone together . ( She exits to the bedroom . ) Ask him what happened . p. 79 CHERYL Roxy  --  ROXY See how good my word is ! ( ROXY exits . CHERYL paces for a moment , as BROCK continues to knock at the door . CHERYL answers the door . ) CHERYL ( Opening door ) Hi . BROCK ( Entering ) Cheryl , where have you been all night ? CHERYL You 're one to ask that question . BROCK Why 'd you get so mad ? You just walked out . CHERYL What did you expect ? BROCK I 've been worried sick about you . You should have called , at least . CHERYL You 're lucky I came back at all . BROCK You 're lucky I did , after that leacherous woman sunk her claws into me . I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this  --  How can you call her your best friend ? CHERYL ( Coyly ) I do n't know what you 're talking about . BROCK I mean , Roxy . Roxy , your friend from L.A. CHERYL All I remember is Pistol , your friend from the strip joint . p. 80 BROCK Roxy made a pass at me . CHERYL Pistol made a pass at every woman in this room , seemingly with your permission . BROCK He was just kidding around . You got ta get to know him , he was just putting on an act . CHERYL There seems to be a lot of that going on these days . BROCK What do you mean ? CHERYL People needing to get to know people . Putting on acts . BROCK Are you referring to me ? CHERYL There was a better way to meet my friends . There was a better way for me to meet Pistol . BROCK Now that I know how this turned out , sure , I wish we 'd all had a formal dinner together down at the Country Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the night before the biggest day of my life . CHERYL I wanted them to myself . I needed to talk about some things , find out how they were doing . Instead , all I found out about was how thin the walls are at Motel 6 . BROCK Cheryl . I 'm sorry . CHERYL I know . BROCK But you did seem awfully touchy . p. 81 CHERYL It was a special night . BROCK I know . CHERYL You know , Brock , I spent most of the night thinking you were in bed with Roxy . BROCK Pistol told me . CHERYL When ? BROCK When I finished helping Roxy with the suitcase . CHERYL It was n't a pleasant thought , I made a decision about marrying you . BROCK I thought you had already made a decision . You said yes . That 's why you had the bloody party . CHERYL It 's never too late to back out . BROCK Great . Now you 're talking about ending our relationship over one shitty night with drunk friends . CHERYL I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were n't exactly Joan of Arc . CHERYL Well , you acted like a used car salesman ! BROCK I am a used car salesman ! CHERYL But you acted like one ! BROCK Excuse me for dropping the mask . I realize I was supposed to impress your wonderful , perfect girlfriends with my looks , and wallet , or something , but if a little of my real personality filtered through , I would think that you could defend me . ( The doorbell rings . CHERYL crosses to answer it . p. 82 CHERYL ( Opening door ) Hi . ( PISTOL , DIANE , and SARAH pour in through the door . ) DIANE ( Hugging her ) Thank God , you 're back , safe and sound ! SARAH ( Hugging her ) We just reported you as missing ! CHERYL Well , I 'm not . PISTOL Thank God you 're not . It would have taken forever for those idiots to find ; Hey Brock . BROCK Hey Pistol . DIANE Where did you go ? CHERYL Motel 6 . SARAH God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BROCK I 'm never letting her out of my sight again , that 's for sure . CHERYL Is it ? ( There 's an uncomfortable pause . ) CHERYL Sarah , Diane , come on . I want to talk . In the bedroom . BROCK The ceremony 's in 2 hours . We do n't have a lot of time . CHERYL I want to talk to them alone . Come on . ( She motions SARAH and DIANE into the bedroom and the three of them exit . ) ( PISTOL and BROCK look at each other. ) p. 83 PISTOL Remind me never to get married . BROCK Do n't ever get married . PISTOL You and Roxy , you really did n't do anything ? BROCK Yes . PISTOL Really ? BROCK You think I 'm lying ? PISTOL Diane has hinted  --  BROCK Screw Diane . PISTOL No , it was Roxy . BROCK I mean , screw the whole bunch of them . I do n't care what any of them think any more . I only cared about them because of Cheryl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had cared about them because you were going to be friends with them , too , the rest of your life , maybe then they would have meant something . I wish Cheryl had felt that way about me . I wish she could have thought I was funny , cared about me , thought I was special because I was your best friend , but then gone deeper . But things being as they were , I did n't exactly give her a chance . BROCK No , I did n't give her a chance . But she did n't give me a chance to know any of them that way either . PISTOL No. p. 84 BROCK You think I blew it ? PISTOL Yeah , to be blunt , buddy . You may have ruined your own marriage . BROCK What ? PISTOL She may not want to go through with it . BROCK How do you know ? PISTOL If they have anything to say about it ! ( He indicates the other room . ) BROCK You think they 're talking her out of it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cheryl 's too independent . PISTOL We 'll see . BROCK You really think they 're gon na come back out here and say it 's off ? PISTOL Yeah . BROCK Damn . PISTOL Ca n't say that I blame her . BROCK I 'll just talk to her . We 'll straighten everything out . PISTOL Right . BROCK We 're in love ! PISTOL That 's nice . p. 85 BROCK Do n't you think we 'd make a good pair ? PISTOL I do n't know . I do n't know her . She seems a little bitchy to me . BROCK Pistol  --  PISTOL She walked out . BROCK Your body offended her ! PISTOL She complained . Threw a fit.She 's old enough to know better . What kind of mother do you think she 'll make ? BROCK This is gon na tear me up . PISTOL I 'm trying to prepare you for the worst . BROCK Just hand me a knife . It 'll be quicker . PISTOL If she really loves you  --  BROCK Well , I thought she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's go get some breakfast . BROCK I ca n't leave again . PISTOL What are you , her puppet ? BROCK Do n't you think this has been complicated enough ? PISTOL Did you bring your clothes ? BROCK No. p. 86 PISTOL I rest my case . You go get some breakfast , to calm you down . You go change your clothes . You come back . If she still wants to marry you , then you 're ready . If not , then at least you have something in your stomach to vomit . BROCK You want to have breakfast ? PISTOL We have n't had any time to talk , just you and me . Not calmly . BROCK I 'm getting this suicidal feeling . PISTOL Not from anything I said , I hope . BROCK From this whole mess . PISTOL Come on , buddy . I 'll tell the girls that we 're leaving . ( He shouts : ) Girls , we 're leaving . We 'll be right back ! BROCK They did n't hear that . PISTOL Sure they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? ( No response . ) Let 's go . BROCK You and me . PISTOL We 'll be good old boys . BROCK I 'm going to eat breakfast . PISTOL With me . I 'll lead you . Follow me . ( They exit . ) ( As soon as the door shuts , SARAH comes out and peers into the room . DIANE follows her. ) p. 87 SARAH They left . DIANE Oh boy . I wonder what that means . CHERYL ( Entering in bridal gown ) Did I just hear the door slam ? Brock  --  ( She stops . ) Where 'd they go ? SARAH Du n no . ( ROXY enters in bridesmaid dress . SARAH has on a slip . DIANE fusses with CHERYL 's dress . ) ROXY Did they say anything ? SARAH I did n't hear anything . CHERYL Well , what the hell do you suppose that means ? ( DIANE , SARAH , and ROXY look at each other . ) SARAH I 'm sure it means nothing . CHERYL Really ? SARAH Yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHERYL Right before the ceremony ? SARAH You know how hungry boys get . CHERYL You 're right . I bet they 're at the 7-11 . Can you help me tie this ? ( DIANE helps her with something on the back of the dress . ) DIANE Hold still . p. 88 CHERYL How do I look ? ROXY Beautiful ! SARAH Radiant . DIANE Magnificent . CHERYL You 'd better get dressed , Diane . DIANE What for ? I mean  --  sure , just a minute . CHERYL Did you say what for ? DIANE Do you really think he 's coming back ? SARAH Diane , you did n't have to say it . None of us said it . DIANE Well , do you ? Raise your hands on the count of three . ROXY Sorority days have ended , Di . CHERYL You think he walked out . DIANE Face it , honey . This is a fiasco . CHERYL No . DIANE It 's been miserable . Embarassing . CHERYL You had some fun with Pistol , did n't you ? ROXY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look at Brock . Would you ever , in your wildest dreams , have guessed that you would have fallen for the likes of him ? Some poor uncouth type from Ohio ? I mean , you should have fought that tendency for all your worth . Think about the men you could have had . It 's mind-boggling . There was Robert , Michael , with the red-fro , Michael . There was Jonothan , Hans , Zachary . Zachary with the yacht , remember ? Carlos , with the 5 Mercedes . Ole , with the fleet in the Norwegian sea . Somewhere in there is Sterling , the gorgeous actor , and Edward , the old professor . Jesus , these are just off the top of my head . No telling what I do n't know . And to think you 'd fall for Brock Bailey , from Ohio , who sells used cars ? p. 89 CHERYL I love him . ROXY Fear is fear . Friends are friends . We 're not above anything . SARAH I wish we could play levitation all night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all night . I wish we could remain young together , in a picture taken right now , locked into our hearts .
