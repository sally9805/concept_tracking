The audience smiles . Men in oversize ties shift in their seats . Women wiggle in their ' 50s-style demure dresses . Comrade Sas , a small , slim , curly-haired Woody Allen-ish figure , twitches his goatee. // // ' ' You think that ' s bad ? ' ' he asks . ' ' Well , we could do worse . Before , there was only one vase. ' ' // This latest show at the Theatre Mikroskop , Hungary ' s leading political cabaret , is insolent , provocative , far-reaching - and still limited . As such , it illustrates the cultural freedom and also the lack of cultural freedom in this most tolerant of East-bloc countries. // By Eastern standards , Hungarian liberalism is striking . In Czechoslovakia , it is impossible to find a copy of Franz Kafka ' s works . On Budapest ' s Vaci Street , all of Kafka ' s volumes sit in the window . So do such Western publications as the Herald Tribune and such controversial books as Saul Bellow ' s ' ' Dean ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a creepy jail with peeling paint. // But behind this liberalism lie boundaries . To see them in the harshest light , just go around the corner from the Theatre Mikroskop and walk up to the fifth-floor apartment of Gabor Demsky. // Mr. Demsky is an independent publisher in a country where all publishing is supposed to be controlled by the state . He edits an underground magazine called Hirmondo , which focuses on the social and political problems inside Hungary - poverty , inequality , alcoholism - as well as on controversial developments in other Soviet-bloc countries. // Demsky says that , in the past few months , his house has been searched , his writings confiscated , and large fines imposed on him and his colleagues . Demsky believes the authorities want to demonstrate toughness as the 30th anniversary of the 1956 revolt approaches. // ' ' The authorities don ' t want to imprison me , ' ' he says . ' ' They just want to harass me , to make my life miserable. ' ' // Why do Demsky and his friends encounter problems ? After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censorship . Many dissidents even continue to publish in the official press. // ' ' I criticized the present five-year economic plan in the latest Journal of Economic Affairs , ' ' economist Tamas Bauer reports . ' ' Almost everything can be published. ' ' // Could he publish his articles in the official press ? ' ' Probably . But on principle I refuse to ask for permission . It ' s my natural right to publish what I want. ' ' // Defending this natural right leads to numerous paradoxes . At a recent meeting of the writers ' union , for example , one writer stood up and said , ' ' Give us censorship . ' ' At least in that way , the writer told English journalist Timothy Garton Ash , ' ' we would know where the hedges are. ' ' // Poland ' s now-banned Solidarity trade union attacked censorship in precisely this way , demanding that it be defined . The result is that censorship is more explicit and visible in Poland than anywhere else in Eastern Europe. // At Theatre Mikroskop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyal Communist Party member , but a ' ' communist without illusions . ' ' Born in 1939 , he grew up during the severe Stalinist 1950s. // ' ' It was impossible to laugh then , even impossible to blink , ' ' he says , chuckling . ' ' We all feared a higher-up was spying on you from under your eyelids. ' ' // Following the trauma of the 1956 revolt , Sas pinned his fortune to conciliatory Communist Party leader Janos Kadar . Mr. Kadar ' s compromise , in rough terms , was that if you observed the political limits , then the state would impose virtually no stylistic limits - and would provide for you generously , even lavishly . Although the limits were never clearly defined , everyone assumed that they fundamentally concerned criticism of the Soviet Union or neighboring socialist states. // That bargain created Theatre Mikroskop . Founded 15 years ago , it carries on the dying tradition of political cabaret in Eastern Europe . In Romania , the cabarets are nonexistent . In Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria , they have been ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly in Krakow , but they are tolerated , not welcomed , by the authorities . Alone in communist Europe , political cabaret in Hungary receives strong official sponsorship. // Hungarians crave the humor . All the Mikroskop ' s seats are booked weeks , even months , in advance . Sas ' s weekly television show , ' ' Kabare , ' ' is a national institution . Some 5 million Hungarians - half the country ' s population - are estimated to tune in every week. // Why ? Sas says because he feeds a hunger to laugh about the mounting problems facing Hungary . In recent years , the country ' s economy has stagnated , prices have risen , and poverty spread. // Sas prides himself in stretching the limits of toleration . In a recent sketch he played Vladimir Lenin , the founder of the Soviet state - and mocked him . ' ' No one else in a socialist country has ever done that , ' ' he says. // With his goatee and his telltale cap in place , he mimics the famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , ' ' he says . ' ' No , no , an experience haunts Europe - communism. // ' ' One day communism will be constructed , ' ' he adds . ' ' Until then . . . . ' ' // Until then , indeed . For there are still subjects that Sas will not touch . The 1956 Hungarian uprising , for example . The Warsaw Pact . ' ' It doesn ' t come up , ' ' he explains . ' ' As long as NATO exists , we need the Warsaw Pact. ' ' // The final message is clear . Sas is free to poke fun at just about everything . But his ultimate message remains clear : The best system is the socialist system. // He returns to his sketch about elections in a communist country . In the most recent parliamentary vote , the authorities permitted two candidates to contest each seat , provided they were reliable party members. // ' ' Two vases are definitely better than one , ' ' Sas says . A fellow comedian agrees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // ' ' No , no , ' ' Sas answers . ' ' You can only have the one on the left. ' ' // //
