Tide of protest engulfs Gdansk <P> Ten years ago , violent food price riots broke out in the grimy Baltic seaport of Gdansk , spread rapidly to other regions and threatened to sweep the country . The government 's brutal response left hundreds of workers dead and forced the resignation of Communist Party Leader Wladyslaw Gomulka . His successor , Edward Gierek , had good cause to reflect upon those events last week . The workers of Gdansk were up in arms again : 16,000 angry employees of the Lenin Shipyard went on strike and occupied the sprawling complex . They were soon joined by bus drivers and workers at some 17 other factories , and the number of strikers swelled to more than 50,000 . <P> The Gdansk upheaval capped a seven-week wave of strikes in Poland , most of them protesting the sharp rise in meat prices since July 1 . More than 200 factories and enterprises have been affected by unrest in such cities as Warsaw , Lublin , Lodz and Wroclaw . Since the strikes began , the government has offered pay increases totaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices . <P> The Gdansk workers tacked a number of political demands onto their calls for a $67-a-month pay increase and a rollback of meat prices . Among them : the establishment of more representative trade unions and the building of a monument to the 49 Gdansk workers killed during the 1970 riots . Seeking to avoid another bloody confrontation , officials at first showed a surprising willingness to negotiate , even at the risk of conferring a de facto legitimacy on the right to strike . Hours after the Gdansk action began , the state-controlled press reported that the government had offered a $40-a-month pay increase , a sum the strikers rejected . But official patience appeared to fray as the strike spread . Shortly after Gierek returned from a visit to the Soviet Union , Premier Edward Babiuch hinted ominously on national television that Poland 's " unbreakable allies " might have to act unless " we can overcome these problems . " <P> At week 's end , the official Polish news agency announced that a tentative settlement with the shipyard workers had fallen through after a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ended their strike after winning a $50 pay raise ; they said they would continue to occupy the shipyard through the weekend in solidarity with strikers elsewhere .
