Representatives of Georgia-Pacific Corporation expect to learn today whether the California Department of Forestry will let loggers clear-cut 75 acres of redwood and Douglas fir trees - known as the Sally Bell Grove - on company property near this gateway to the Sinkyone Wilderness State Park in northwest Mendocino County. // If the state grants permission , environmentalists say they will challenge the ruling in court on grounds that the logging company , based in Atlanta , Ga. , has ignored California ' s environmental protection laws in its timber harvest plan. // Should court action fail to block the harvest , says John DeWitt , executive director of the San Francisco-based Save the Redwood League , ' ' I imagine they ( the environmentalists ) will go out and chain themselves to the trees. ' ' // // The emotional battle between loggers and environmentalists goes back more than 10 years . Two years ago it boiled over in a confrontation in the Sally Bell Grove. // Georgia-Pacific tried to clear-cut the grove but was stalled by demonstrators who hugged trees and positioned themselves so the giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two dozen people were arrested for trespassing , but the protest delayed the loggers long enough for lawyers to obtain a series of restraining orders. // Richard Gienger lives on the edge of Sinkyone State Park and is the leading spokesman against logging the redwoods . A member of the Sinkyone Council , an advocacy group for purchasing the land , Mr. Gienger predicted more arrests if Georgia-Pacific starts to log : ' ' We ' re talking about destroying one of the last remnants of trees that go back nearly 2 , 000 years . The trees are going to be protected. ' ' // Georgia-Pacific officials say they are caught between environmentalists who favor preserving those trees and loggers who fear the loss of jobs . One out of 10 people in Mendocino County is employed in the lumber and wood-products industry. // ' ' Right now , the company is in a box , ' ' says Georgia-Pacific spokesman Brian Gard . ' ' We ' re looking for a balanced solution. ' ' // For years , successive park administrations have wanted to add Georgia-Pacific ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - to the existing Sinkyone Wilderness State Park to the north. // The company ' s land is the only remaining coastal region left in the United States that is not bisected by a road , says Northern California Sierra Club spokesman Bob Mark , a supporter of buying the land for the park system . Even California ' s famous Route 1 veers inland here to avoid the plunging cliffs and pounding surf adjacent to the Sally Bell grove. // After more than 10 years of battling conservationists , Georgia-Pacific agreed in April 1985 to sell the land , much of which has already been logged. // Company officials asked for $10 million , and it appeared that they would get it . The Democratic controlled state Legislature authorized $7 million for fiscal 1985-86 toward the purchase , and the Save the Redwood League and the federal government pledged the difference. // But last summer , Republican Gov . George Deukmejian unexpectedly vetoed the Legislature ' s appropriation , saying that park money should be used to buy parkland ' ' close to the state ' s population centers. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Georgia-Pacific executives , weary of the battle , say they are tired of being the bad guys , noting that in 1969 they donated to the state two redwood groves worth $6 million in another area of northern California. // This fall the state forestry department reviewed , perhaps for the last time , Georgia-Pacific ' s latest timber harvest plan . The company revised the plan after losing a prolonged court battle over the original timber harvest plan to Mr. Gienger and an umbrella organization called the Environmental Protection Information Center. // Forestry officials say the revised plan meets all but one of the state ' s standards - a ban on winter logging . However , the company is expected to agree to hold off logging until the spring , hoping this agreement will aid them in winning the department ' s approval. // Ed Martin , a resource manager for the forestry department , says the department can reject a logging plan only if the harvest would erode soil , damage rivers and streams , and destroy state-protected archaeological sites. // ' ' We can ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of chopping down redwoods , ' ' says Mr. Martin , whose office has been besieged by letters protesting Georgia-Pacific ' s proposed harvest. // If the state agency lets the timber company harvest the trees , environmentalists say they plan to argue in court that the company ' s harvest plans do not show in great enough detail the cumulative effect from logging as required by the state. // The steep hillsides astride the Little Jackaff Creek , which meanders through the Sally Bell Grove , were once home to the Sinkyone Indian tribe . Many locals , not necessarily committed to preserving redwoods , oppose Georgia-Pacific ' s harvest plan because it would destroy ancient Indian sites located in the area. // The controversy has divided local citizens , many of whom depend on logging for their livelihood . Concern about the loss of timber-related jobs and local tax revenue prompted Mendocino County officials last spring to oppose purchase of the land for a state park. // Georgia-Pacific and the state forestry department defend the proposed timber harvest , saying 225 , 000 acres of redwood are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' The opponents to our harvest really don ' t want us to cut down any redwood no matter where it is , ' ' says Georgia-Pacific ' s Mr. Gard . ' ' We don ' t agree. ' ' // But conservationists counter with their own statistics . Of the original 2 million to 3 million acres of redwood that blanketed the Pacific Northwest , only 3 to 6 percent remains . Gienger says , ' ' As the country ' s population grows , more and more people are going to wish we saved these trees. ' ' // // // // //
