oak , Joe , " pop said . He spoke very slowly and clearly , the way Miss Bush , our fifth- grade teacher , does when she is trying to get something across to a dumb kid . He dropped his paper and shook his head . " 1 hope 1 am saying this for the last time , Joe . I like dogs . If it would help , I would have ' Dog 's Best Friend ' printed on my calling cards . Someday , when and if I am no longer a slave to be sent hither and yon at the whim of the powers that be in the National Machinery Corporation , you will have a dog . But right now , Joe , it looks as if we may get that apartment in the Banner Arms before fall . A dog in the Banner Arms has the same standing as a snowball in Hades . Ergo , no dog . Sorry , Joe . " " That 's right , " mother said . " We are sorry , Joe  --  truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have all the dogs you want  --  well , one dog , anyway . In the meantime , we just have to get that Banner Arms apartment . This decayed rattrap is impossible . Your father has to spend most of his leisure time just trying to keep things working after a fashion . As for me ? " " O.K. , " I said . " O.K. " It was the old story . I looked at mother , who is small and brown-haired . I looked at pop , who is tall and sort of skinny and very dark . They have a habit of smiling a great deal . But right now neither one was smiling . " O.K. , " I said . " I guess I 'll go outside and look at other people 's dogs , if nobody minds . " Pop brought his feet down off the stool with a bang . " Joe , I think I 'm a reasonably patient man , but -- - " " Hold your horses , George , " mother said . " Easy does it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . I heard a dog bark , a long way off . I judged him to be a small-sized dog with a testy nature . When you have studied dogs as much as I have , you know about things like that . I looked all around . There was no dog in sight , which was good . I felt bad enough now without having to see a dog . I told myself I should not blame my parents . But the fact remained that the house we were renting was n't really so bad . It was true that there were termites . It was also true that the plumbing kept getting out of whack and the fuses had a habit of blowing . Then there was that business about the leaks , and the mice in the attic . Mother made an awful lot of unnecessary fuss about the mice  --  they hardly came downstairs at all , and they could n't do any harm just playing around among themselves up there . But generally speaking , the house was perfectly comfortable . And it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble was that the owner would n't fix anything  --  if we did n't like it , he said , we could move out and he could rent it 20 times over the next morning . National Machinery , which pop works for as a production expert , had built a big new plant in this little town , and finding a place to live , as pop put it , was like finding an easy route out of Alcatraz . We 'd been lucky to find any place to live . Pop would n't build , for we 'd probably be here only two or three years . There was but one good apartment house in town , the Banner Arms . Pop had been promised the next vacancy . So , no dog . I sat on the stoop and thought about dogs . Big dogs , little dogs . Tight-skinned dogs and loose-skinned dogs . Short-haired dogs and woolly dogs . Dogs that laughed and dogs that looked sad . Finally I went back inside . Mother was making cooking noises in the kitchen . Pop was starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been some dog you had when you were about my age , " I said . " That dog you named Shep . " Pop sat up straight . He said , " I thought I told you -- - " " I 'm not asking for any old dog , " I said . " I was just thinking about that dog named Shep , because you told me how good he was . I remember that picture of him you showed me one time . " Pop 's eyes seemed to soften a little . He 'd been awful fond of Shep . " Shep , " he said , " was as fine and faithful and intelligent a dog as ever lived . They do n't make ' em like Shep any more . He was the real old-type farm collie . I do n't know how long it 's been since I 've seen a farm collie . " " Jack Rutherford 's got a collie , " I said . " With papers , too . " " Collie ! Papers ! " pop said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , with a muzzle like a greyhound 's and hardly enough skull room for a sparrow 's brain . You were born too late , Joe . " I said , " You know , I 'll bet if we looked around real good we might find one of those old-type farm collies like Shep . He would n't cost much , either . We could --  " " Joe ! " Pop 's eyes turned steely . " That 's enough . Period . " " Yes , sir . But I wasn't --  " " George ! " mother called . Her voice was high , as it always is when something goes wrong . " The pipe under the sink 's leaking again . " Pop said a word . Just one . It is a word that people are not supposed to say . He went into the kitchen . It was a good strong leak . Pop put a bucket under it , got his pipe wrench , and went to work . Mother began mopping up the water that had flowed across the floor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother did n't seem to hear it . Pop went down to the basement to shut off the water line . Meanwhile , the water flowed over the bucket , and by the time I got it emptied and back in place , the job was too much for just a mop , so we started in with a bunch of towels . Pop came back from the basement saying bad words of many kinds . He told us there was something wrong with the so-and-so shut-off thing and he could n't budge it . He called Mr. Mount , the plumber . Mr. Mount arrived in an hour . We spent the time emptying and replacing buckets and mopping . Mr. Mount had to tear quite a bit of wood out of the wall to get at the seat of the trouble . Maybe , pop said , this would weaken the house so that the whole works would fall in , and he hoped it would . Mr. Mount laughed and took time out to smoke most of a cigar , slowly . Finally Mr. Mount was done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of her , I mean  --  you strengthen one part of an old beat-up system like this and you never know where she 'll let go next . Ca n't guarantee nothing . You know what I 'd do if I lived here ? " Pop did not answer , but that did not discourage Mr. Mount . " Why , I 'd get me a shovel and dig me a well in the backyard and carry my water in buckets . " Mr. Mount roared with laughter at his joke . He was the only one . " Very funny , " pop said . " What do I owe you ? " Mr. Mount stopped laughing . " Well , let 's see . I never soak a guy  --  honest work for an honest price is my motto . But you called me away from dinner , and I been working like a horse all day . Well , we 'll just call it 15 bucks . " Pop paid . Mr. Mount left . I gathered up the torn bits of wood . Mother said dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has taken me 35 years of living to learn that Elysium and the Banner Arms are one and the same place , " pop said . " Amen , " mother said . I said nothing . I was thinking about dogs . I needed a dog more than I 'd ever needed anything . I felt really terrible . I did a lot of planning . I thought about trying to talk Mr. Bannerman , who owns the Banner Arms , into letting us keep a nice quiet dog that no one would even know was around . But that was hopeless  --  everybody said Mr. Bannerman was as much against cats and dogs as he was against babies , which was as much as possible . I thought about finding a nice modern house we could rent , in which everything would go like clockwork . But there was n't so much as a vacant birdhouse in the whole town . I wondered why pop did n't talk to his boss and get himself a permanent location now instead of in a few years . I mentioned this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day 1 heard about the litter of pups on the farm outside of town a few miles . I ran into a kid I knew and he had this pup . As soon as I saw that pup I thought of the picture of pop 's old-type farm collie , Shep . He had the same kind of head and feet and everything . You could tell just by looking at him he was going to grow up smart as a whip . The kid told me about this farmer and where he lived . There had been ten pups , he said , and the farmer was giving them away . This was a Saturday morning . For an hour I just rode around on my bike , going nowhere and back . I told November ' 87 myself I 'd be crazy to go out to that farm  --  it would just make everything worse to see the pups and know they were going free to people who could n't need a dog as much as I did . Then I started out that way . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , and there were two fine big dogs that would be the pups ' parents . They were old-type farm collies , like Shep , and no question about it . I went down the farmer 's road , feeling  --  well , the feeling was so mixed-up I could n't describe it . I heard little barking and yapping sounds . Just past the gate there was a pen made of chicken wire . Inside the pen were eight pups . Well , it was something . I pushed my fingers through the wire and they all tried to grab hold at once . I pulled my fingers back , and they all yelled at me to shove them in again . There was one that took my notice special . He was a trifle bigger than the rest , and he had a wonderful , thick coat and plenty of voice and nerve . When he took hold of a finger , he took hold and no fooling . And when he looked up at me with his big brown-and-gold eyes , he seemed to be saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was having a wonderful time in one way . In another way I was hurting all over . Back of me , a voice said , " Hello , son , " and I looked around . The farmer was a husky , pleasant-looking man . I said , " Hello , sir . I hope it 's all right to look at your pups . " " Sure , " he said . " Want one ? " " Well ? " I said , " well , not exactly . That is --  " He laughed . " I see . You 've got a problem . " " Yes , sir , " I said . " Well , look all you like , " he said . " You can go inside the cage if you 're careful not to let any of ' em out . They 're heck to catch . And if you want one you can have one . That is , if you can give him a proper home . " He walked away . But I could still hear what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . If you want one you can have one . It was like a tune ; it stuck the way a good tune does . I went inside the cage . All the pups swarmed over me and grabbed at me . But that particular one grabbed harder and held on longer than the others . He 's like pop 's old Shep , I thought . I 'd call him Shep . Shep the Second . Pop would like that . Only it was impossible because of the Banner Arms and all . " Shep , " I said . " Hi there , Shep . " I sent him sprawling and he came charging right back , growling like a lion . " No , you do n't , " I said and sent him sprawling again . But he took quite a bit of my pants pocket with him . The farmer came back again , and just then I got the idea . There was no sense in it , I admit . But it was an idea . " Look , mister , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of borrowed him for a little while ? Then , if I have to , I 'll bring him back . I 'd take awful good care of him . " " Let 's have the story , son . " I told it to him , as straight as I could . He said , " You 're in a fix , son . Does n't look to me like you 're in the market for a dog . " " I 'd just like to borrow him , " I said . " I ? " " O.K. , " he said . " It 's your funeral . Good luck . " It was wonderful riding home with Shep the Second , even though he was just borrowed . I put him inside my shirt and he liked it  --  he did n't make any trouble , and the little skin he clawed off my chest did no harm . A couple of times things got damp , but that did n't do any harm , either , him being only a puppy and all . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sat on the back stoop with Shep and wondered what to do . I heard footsteps in the kitchen . The door opened . Pop said , " Where in God 's green world  --  Joe , where did you get that dog ? " " This is Shep the Second , " I said . " And he 's a genuine old-type farm collie . " " That was not the question , " pop said . " Whose dog is that ? " // " Well , " I said , " it 's kind of mixed up . I mean --  " " You 'd better start talking , Joe , " pop said . " And fast . " So I explained how I 'd just borrowed Shep , really , and no harm had been done at all , and how I 'd known pop would want to see him because real , genuine old-type farm collies were so rare . Before I was finished , mother came out too . " O.K. , " pop said . " I 'll accept your explanation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " Shep went over and smelled pop 's pants . He looked up at pop and gave a friendly little bark . He looked up at mother and did the same thing . Then he sat back on his fat bottom and waved his front paws . " I got an idea , " I said . " I could keep him here , kind of like a boarder , till we move . Then I could take him back or find a fine home for him . Just till then . " " No , " pop said . " No dice . " Shep was licking pop 's shoe . Pop bent down and touched his head . " He 's a farm collie at that , " he said in that low , talking-to-yourself way . Then he straightened up quick . " Get going , Joe . " " Please , " I said . " Just till we move . I 'll get rid of him then and I wo n't kick at all . I promise . " Pop looked at mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really now , Joe  --  oh , you decide , 45 George , " she said quickly . " Honest , " I said . " Cross my heart and hope to die and everything . Just till we move . " Shep was now working on pop 's pants cuff . Pop stooped down and worked him loose . Pop picked him up and bounced him around and Shep laughed , plain as anything . " I want this to be perfectly clear , " pop said . " With no ifs , ands , or buts when the time comes . You may keep this dog  --  assuming , of course , that you take the full care of him  --  until our vacancy occurs at the Banner Arms . As of that moment you 'll take him back to your farmer or find him a good home . And there 'll be no squawk . Agreed ? " " Yes , sir ! " I said . " All right , " pop said . " Do n't forget it . " ? ? ? You 'd hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any trouble to housebreak at all  --  even mother admitted that , after making quite an uproar about his few mistakes . And he grew like a shot . School ended and the long vacation started . I had a dog  --  the best dog on earth . But time was going by and I had to wonder how I was going to keep my dog . I do n't want anyone to think I was planning to try to go back on the agreement . It was n't that . It was just  --  well , it 's hard to explain . Anyhow , I was always worried . Especially after I heard what they said that evening when they did n't know I was around . I 'd just come inside with Shep . Pop and mother were in the kitchen . I heard pop say , " I ran into Bannerman today . He ca n't be positive , but there may be a vacancy in a month . Somebody there is expecting to get a transfer . " Mother said , " I 'd gladly give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this linoleum , that bathroom  --  oh , George , moving day will be the happiest day of my life . One of the happiest , anyhow . Pop laughed . " Glad you qualified it , " he said . " We 've had some mighty happy days . Well , keep your sight , on the main field as well as on adjacent fields . The Middlebury athletic director responded by sending Norwich a bill . Destruction of enemy property has never come up to the high standards of kidnapping , however , be it the Navy goat , the Army mule , or something as defenseless as the Old Oaken Bucket . The Bucket has its defenders , nonetheless , as an interloper from Purdue discovered one year when he attempted to liberate it from the Indiana University administration building . " Stop ! " rang out in the hushed corridor . A coed came flying out of an office , tackled the would-be thief in mid-stride , and promptly bit him  --  in the stomach . The Navy goat , the Army mule , the Old Oaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieve the Coast Guard Academy of its mascot , a live bear , before the " Little Army-Navy Game " with Norwich ? Norwich students , of course . And these brave lads actually pulled it off  --  until they were about ten miles out of town , at which point their cargo went berserk . And at which point the students went directly back to town and put the bear back where they had found it . Oh , well , as they say in rivalries , you win some and you lose some . A No Dogs Allowed continued from page 45 fingers crossed . " " It 's going to be hard on Joe , George . He and Shep  --  we never should have let him keep Shep . " It was a long moment before pop spoke again . When he did , his voice was extra firm . " I made an agreement with him , " he said . " There will be no misunderstandings . And I 'm going to hold him to the letter of it or my name is n't George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd been listening so hard I 'd forgotten to watch Shep . He was eating a corner of the rug . However , by just moving a chair a little , I covered it . We went outside again . Shep wanted to play so I threw sticks for him to fetch  --  he was as good a retriever , practically , as any hunting dog . But I was n't having much fun myself . Not with what I had to think about . Pop came out and watched Shep retrieve . I gave pop the stick and he threw it and Shep brought it back to him nice as you please . Then all three of us sat down on the steps , with Shep in the middle . Pop patted him and Shep rattled a step board with his tail ; the boards were kind of loose , on account of the wood underneath being dry rotted . " You know , " I said , " this is a pretty nice house , at that . There 's a lot of good things about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupted , " should be used as a jail for the most vicious criminals imaginable . It would be a suitable punishment . And now we will not mention this house again . " " Yes , sir , " I said . " I was only thinking --  " " Stop thinking , " pop said . " And that 's an order . " Shep put his head in pop 's lap , yawned , and went to sleep . " It 's a funny thing , " I said . " I mean , when we thought there were n't any real farm-type collies any more and then --  " " I do n't want to hear about farm-type collies or any other kind of dog , either , " pop said . He stood up . This made Shep roll over and down a step . But Shep did n't mind . He did n't even wake up . Pop stood there looking at him . " Joe , there 's something youmust n't forget , " he said . He stopped . " What ? " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , " he said . " You 'd better get cleaned up . It 's close to dinner time . " He went inside . So there I was , alone with Shep . I touched him gentle-like with my toe , and he turned underside up with all his paws waving . You think you 've got a home , I thought . You think you 're all fixed up for good and all . You think there is n't a thing in the world to worry about . Well , if you knew what I know --  " Shep , " I said aloud , and he opened his eyes . " Shep , " I said again , and he stood up and stretched , and came to me , and put his head on my knee , and looked up into my face with his whole body wagging . " We got to do something quick . You and me , Shep . " ? ? ? I began to make a few repairs around the house . I planed down some of the doors so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the leak in the spare room that nobody had been able to fix , though of course I could n't be sure I had it licked until there was a rain . I glued down the linoleum around the edges of the kitchen floor , too , and maybe it was n't an A-one job , but it was something . When I showed pop what I 'd done , he did n't say anything for a minute . Then he shook his head and said , " You 're wasting your time , Joe . The only thing that could fix this dump properly is an atom bomb , and I 'm not about to be persuaded otherwise . Sorry . " And time was passing , fast . Like in the movies , when they riffle a calendar and the days just go whoosh ! and in a second it 's next season or next year . That should have been a fine summer . The weather was perfect , and I had Shep , and Shep had me , and the fishing in the river was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some good times , no question about it . But it was never what it ought to have been , with this thing always hanging over us . This particular afternoon I was feeling extra sad . It had been just a month since I 'd overheard their conversation in the kitchen . Shep and I were down by the river by ourselves . Once in a while I 'd throw a stick into the water , and he 'd go tearing in and fetch it . He was a good swimmer , though he had n't had much experience . We came to the place where the river enters a little canyon and narrows . The water really boils through there , and it geysers up and around some big sharp rocks . It 's supposed to be the most dangerous spot on the whole stream . It 's no place for swimming . I did this crazy thing  --  I threw the stick in . Naturally , I was n't thinking about it . My mind was on the Banner Arms and what would happen to Shep and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as it was out of my hand , I realized what I 'd done . Shep was streaking for the river . I yelled at him , trying to stop him . But I 'd thrown the stick , and he knew he was supposed to get it , and that was that . He took off from the bank like his legs were springs . He hit the water with a big splash and started for the stick . Then the current caught him and spun him around and he was in trouble . Big bad trouble . He tried to fight the current  --  there was no give-up in Shep  --  but he did n't have a chance . I was still yelling , and he made a little turn and tried to swim back . But that was no good , either . The current was carrying him out and down the stream , toward the rocks . I do n't want to make out I was feeling like a hero or anything . I was n't . It was just a case where there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . I ran down the bank maybe a hundred feet . There was n't time to get rid of my clothes . I took a look upstream at Shep , gauged my distance , and dived in . I stayed underwater for a while , figuring it would be smoother going there than on the surface . I came up and found that the current was even stronger than I thought . I had a fight on my hands . I tried to spot Shep , but a wave broke around my head and blinded me . Then I saw him  --  three or four yards off and moving downstream terrible fast . I caught him by a hind leg and pulled us together . I worked my hand up until I had an arm around his neck and my fingers laced about his collar . Then I made for shore , digging in with my free arm and kicking out with my legs . Well , it was quite a time . You do n't know how strong water can be unless you 've been in a spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet downstream toward the worst of the rocks for every foot we made toward the land . I was scared , I 'll admit it . Scared pink . A time or two I did n't know whether we 'd ever get there or not . If Shep had kicked up a fuss , we never would have , that 's for sure . But he knew the score as well as I did . He was swimming with all four legs and helping out all he could . I could n't see much of anything . I just swam , angled against that current . My hand touched something hard and I caught hold . It was a little tree . I yanked  --  the tree gave some , but it did n't come loose . We were on shore . For a while I just lay there on the bank , getting my wind back . Shep shook himself and licked my face and rolled all over me . I stood up . It was late afternoon and turning cool . " Let 's go , boy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , Shep beside me . I figured I 'd sneak up to my room and change my clothes before I was seen . But it did n't work . Pop was in the living room , in a chair that gave him a perfect view of the stairs . Mother was there , too , sitting on the sofa . I had my foot on the third step when he saw me . " Hey , " he said . " Wait a minute . Come here . " " I 'm just going --  " " Come here , Joe , " he said . I walked into the living room , Shep with me . I 'd dried out some , but not enough . Water oozed out of my sneakers . Even Shep was still a little wet . Mother made a nervous sound . Pop eyed me up and down . " All right , " he said . " What hap-pened ? " " Why , nothing , " I said . " It was n't anything , I just --  " " Let 's have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of voice that meant he meant it . All of a sudden this thought came to me , out of nowhere . " Well , " I said , " I was walking down by the river , and I was thinking about some things , and I fell in . There where it 's fast and narrow , below the bridge . continued from page 95 That sure is a bad place . Worst I ever saw . And Shep  --  well , he came right into the water after me and grabbed hold of my arm and practically pulled me out . if it had n't been for him  --  well , I do n't know what would have happened . " It did n't sound as good as I 'd hoped it would . But it did n't sound so bad either . " Yes , sir , " I said . " If it had n't been for Shep --  " " Hold it , Joe , " pop said . Mother was standing beside his chair now , her face all serious . " Are you trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river , as well as you swim ? " " It 's an awful bad place , " 1 said . " And Shep --  " " I want the truth , Joe . The plain truth . " I looked at him and at mother . Then I told them the truth , exactly as it happened . He looked down at the floor . He rubbed his left arm with his right hand . He said , " So you took a chance like that , for Shep . " " Well , it was my fault , " I said . " And then there was n't any --  " " O.K. , Joe , " he said . " We understand . " For quite a while no one said anything . Shep rubbed against me . And then I began talking to him . Not with words , of course . I did n't speak to him . I did n't even touch him . I talked to him the way you can talk to a dog if  --  well , I ca n't quite explain it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , Shep , you do something to help out . I 've said everything I can think of . Come on , boy . As I say , I did n't say a word or do a thing . But he heard me , and he understood . He walked over to pop and put his head on pop 's knee . He stayed like that , looking up into pop 's face . That was how it was when the phone rang . Mother answered . She said , " George , it 's Mr. Bannerman . " Pop got out of his chair . It seemed to me he moved very slowly , but I was so worried I could n't be sure . He took the phone and said , " Hello ? " and listened for a moment . Then he said , " Will you hold the line , please , Mr. Bannerman ? " He put his hand over the part of the phone you talk into . He looked at mother . She looked back at him , smiled and nodded her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've lost . " Pop talked into the phone again . " We 've changed our plans , Mr. Ban nerman . We wo n't be taking the apartment after all . Sorry to have been so much trouble . Yes , that 's right  --  we wo n't be wanting it . Thanks . Good-by . " Pop hung up the phone . " Pop ! " I said . " Mother ! You mean --  " " Skip it , " pop said . " We will now have a moment of unbroken silence while your mother and I wonder why this had to happen to us . " But he was sort of grinning when he said it . A little while later mother went into the kitchen to start dinner . 1 heard her turn on the water in the sink , and then she called , " George ! It 's leaking again . Worse than ever . " Pop got up . He opened his mouth as if to say something  --  like that word you are n't supposed to say . But he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was n't gone hardly any time at all . He came back to the living room and phoned Mr. Mount , the plumber , to hurry over .
