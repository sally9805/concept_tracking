RAY KROC : BURGER MASTER When a traveling salesman got a billion-burger idea in a little San Bernardino carry-out , he gave the name McDonald 's more than just a shake . by William Barry Furlong He had dreams . He had ideas . They just never seemed to come together . He was left with hope  --  that it was never too late . He was in his 50s now  --  an " old " man and an incipient arthritic , with diabetes and with the usual plagues from the past : He 'd already lost through surgery his gall bladder and his thyroid gland . The economic facts were just as harsh : His business was at a dead end . He had to get a new idea to keep it going , to keep his dreams alive . He did it . At the tree-ripened age of 52 , Ray Kroc got a new idea . And a more beckoning dream . The result : Ray Kroc became a billionaire . And he made multimillionaires of many other people  --  perhaps more people in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea became more than a business . It became a phenomenon . It was called McDonald 's Hamburgers and today it is a $6 billion-a-year  --  and growing  --  enterprise . The assets of Ray Kroc were his attitudes , not his wealth , health and heritage . He was never rich : His father worked for Western Union , and he worried himself to death over his debts during the Great Depression . On his desk the day he died , " says Kroc , " were two pieces of paper  --  his last paycheck from the telegraph company and a garnishment notice for the entire amount of his wages . " He was not from one of the " genteel " cultures , the richly endowed WASPS with an Ivy League Eastern background : He is a middle-class Midwesterner of Bohemian ancestry . Far from following in the " rich " footsteps of any ancestor , he did not even meet his father 's dreams : His father had " left school in the eighth grade and he was determined that I would finish high school . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dropout . As a young man he was a piano player in bars , in bordellos ( for one night ) and on radio stations . Later , he was a real estate salesman in Florida when the great Floridaland boom collapsed . Finally , he began selling paper cups when they were a rare  --  and rarely sought  --  commodity ( i.e. , before they were advertised on TV ) . He sold them to Italian pushcart vendors in Chicago who would make them into " squeeze cups " ? they " filled them with flavored ice and sold them one ounce for a penny , two ounces for two cents . " He sold them to Polish folk on the northwest side of Chicago , where the shopkeepers used them to serve " Povidla , " a kind of prune butter . He spent 17 years doing this , working hard on ideas that would develop volume . At one point , he got his volume up to the level of selling five million paper cups a year to at least two different soda fountain and drugstore chains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another field : He began selling machines called Multimixers that could make as many as five milk shakes at a time . He did well . But as he got into his middle years , he saw times were changing . Drugstores were no longer building soda fountains into their new locations ; indeed , many of them were pulling soda fountains out of the stores they already had . By the time Ray Kroc was in his 50s , he realized that the market potential for Multimixers was in decline . So he began looking ever more aggressively for ideas that would help him develop new and different markets for the Multimixer . One of the markets he began exploring was not  --  in the 1950s  --  a terribly large or compelling one : the little hamburger huts that were then scattered rather sparsely here and there around the country . One day while he was visiting Los Angeles , he rented a car and drove 60 miles east  --  out to the edge of the desert , to San Bernardino  --  to take a look at one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total of eight of his Multimixers . He was a little curious about what kind of drive-in had enough business to make 40 milk shakes at a time . Continued on page 69 continued from page 64 On first sight he was puzzled . He parked across the street from the drive-in and could see nothing obvious about its attraction . The place was spotlessly clean , but it had no particular gloss , no swank , no " angle . " Yet people were practically running to this plain , waitressless drive-in to get in line and were going away with bagfuls of hamburgers . He got out of his car to do a bit of market research . He joined the end of a line and fell into conversation with people around him . The answers were pretty much the same : You did n't get much in the way of variety here  --  hamburgers , French fries and something to drink were all they had  --  but whatever you got was the best you could get anywhere . Moreover , the price was right : 15 cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and a dime for the French fries . So for a quarter you could get a reasonable lunch , and it would cost only another nickel ( for coffee ) or 20 cents ( for a malted or milk shake ) to get a drink to go with it . " This had to be the most amazing merchandising operation I 'd ever seen , " says Ray Kroc . The Great Idea did not come instantly . He did not look around and say , " I 'll open 6,000 of these and make a couple of billion dollars . " Instead , he thought ' in more immediate and practical terms : " If I can get the guys who run this place to open a couple more just like it , they might buy 16 more Multimixers from me . " When the lunch-hour crowd thinned out a bit , he went into the drive-in and introduced himself to the owners  --  Dick and Maurice McDonald . They greeted him warmly and showed him around the place . He noticed once again the extreme cleanliness , inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spoilage because the brothers could carefully control the very few items they had to buy and store and serve . Most of all , they 'd analyzed every operation in making and serving hamburgers and French fries , and they 'd developed from this a quick-response assembly line that allowed them to fill every order within a few seconds after it was made . That expanded their potential volume hundreds of times over : They could satisfy a customer  --  more than satisfy him , in fact  --  and get his cash and move him out to be replaced by another customer within 30 seconds or so . That compared with the restaurant-style luncheon place where a customer might tie up a place at a table ( or counter ) for a half hour to an hour . The one thing that the McDonalds did not have was a remorseless ambition . They were planning to open one more drive-in and that was going to be it . " But why not reach out a little and open eight or ten more ? " said Kroc , thinking of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take him to a window and show him a big white house on a high slope that overlooked the area where they had their drive-in . " That 's our home and we love it , " one of them told him . They were n't about to leave it or jeopardize it . That left Kroc stunned . He fumbled around conversationally for a while and then came up with another Continued on page 116 Ray Kroc continued from page 69 thought : " Why not let a bunch of other people open up some more of these drive-ins  --  say , one apiece  --  and operate them for you ? And pay you for the rights and the idea ? " They 'd already tried that , said the McDonalds . In fact , there were eight or ten McDonald's-type drive-ins scattered through California and Arizona that they 'd licensed to operate pretty much as they did . But they were not all of the same high quality as the McDonaids ' original drive-in , and anything lower in quality tended to reflect on the brothers and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kroc sent up two ideas and saw both of them shot down . It began to look as if he 'd never get this new market for his Multimixers . He made one last try . It took form something like this : " Why do n't you get one person  --  somebody you really trust  --  who wants the same high quality you have ? And let that one person ride herd on the whole operation  --  finding operators , finding places for them to set up shop , building the drive-ins , making sure that all the operators adhere to the standards you want . That way you get some income and your standards , but you do n't have the problems  --  that one guy takes care of them for you . " " One man ? Like who ? " one of them asked . " Like me , " he replied . He did n't even begin to think about how much work it would be . Or how much he knew about selling hamburgers , which was zilch . All he could think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this kind of deal , he 'd find it easier to peddle Multimixers to the new store owners . By the time he went home to Chicago the next day , he knew everything about Mc-Donald 's from the recipe for their French fries to the details of the drive-in 's floor plan . He also had a signed contract in his pocket , one that gave him the power to organize the system and ride shotgun on it . The contract provided that there 'd be a charge of $950 to each individual who wanted a license to duplicate what the McDonalds did . That was intended to offset the costs that Kroc encoun tered in getting the system going . Furthermore , Kroc would collect 1.9 percent of all the money that the new store owners took in ? " right off the top " ? and he 'd give .5 percent out of this 1.9 percent fa half-cent out of every dollar that came in ) to the McDonald brothers . That meant that if somebody they licensed opened another McDonald drive-in and took in 8100,000 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd send $500 of it to the McDonald brothers , and he 'd get to keep $1,400 . Kroc 's expectation was that he would get his expenses paid and that he might make a little more money by selling the new store owners some Multimixers . He did n't arrange to take a salary ; in fact , he did n't take a salary for a number of years . He lived off his old job and whatever profits the new enterprise might turn up for him . They had no trouble with the name . Kroc thought that " McDonald " was a promotable name and he  --  like everybody else  --  could see there might be certain difficulties with a food-delivery system using the name " Kroc . . . " There was no trouble with quality control . They wrote the quality standards into the agreement with an innocent ar rangement that would cause Kroc endless anguish later on . The clause simply bound him to do exactly what the McDonald brothers did to guarantee that the new drive-ins would be exactly like the San Bernardino drive-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Bernardino drive-in  --  and the golden arches  --  and he liked the idea of doing everything just as the McDonalds did . In fact , he went so far as to agree in the contract that he would n't deviate from any detail of the San Bernardino drive-in without getting the agreement of both brothers in writing and having it sent to him by registered mail . On the whole , he was quite pleased when he flew home to Chicago . He had the beginnings of a new growth market for his Multimixers , and he had something that he thought would make him a little more money on the side . He decided that the first thing he 'd do would be to open a McDonald 's in the Chicago area as an experiment , to learn about the business from the inside and  --  assuming it was the hit that it had been in San Bernardino  --  to make a bit of a profit . So he found a lot on Lee Street in Des Plaines , a suburb northwest of Chicago . It was a seven-minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commuter station where he could catch a train into the Loop . He 'd get up around 5:30 in the morning , drive to the Mc-Donald 's site around dawn , work until it was time to go downtown and then leave his car and walk to the train station for the Loop-bound commuter . He 'd work all day and into the evening with his Multimixers , catch an evening train back to Des Plaines , work at the McDonald 's to closing time and then drive home to catch a few hours of sleep . There was an overriding problem : He did n't have much money to build his dream . Or to build his Mc-Donald 's , for that matter . So he went to a construction man named Art Jacobs and offered to split the ownership with him 50-50 if Jacobs would build the stand for him . Jacobs agreed . And the first question he asked  --  on studying the floor plans of the drive-in he was to copy  --  was to set Kroc on the path to years of travail : " Where do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Continued on following page Kroc never quite anticipated . But it was logical when he thought about it . The San Bernardino drive-in was designed for a semi-arid near-desert region where temperatures were usually moderate and the precipitation was low . So it had no furnace and no dehumidifying system and no real ventilating or exhaust system outside of open windows , the desert breezes and a " swamp cooler " on the roof . Chicago , of course , has extreme temperature variations and heavy precipitation . " How about the basement ? That 's where they usually go , " said Jacobs . But there was no basement in the original San Bernardino drive-in . It was built on a concrete slab . And Kroc was obligated to follow the original plans in every detail . He was legally bound not to put a furnace in his new building in Chicago . Or a ventilation system . Or a cooling system . He did the logical thing . He phoned the McDonald brothers long-distance and got their permission , over the phone , to deviate this much from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble was that the contract did not allow for a verbal permission to make a change from the original plans ; the permission had to be in writing , signed by both brothers and sent to Kroc by registered mail . Somehow the McDonalds never gave him written permission via a registered letter . He was technically  --  and factually  --  in violation of the contract from the moment he made a change with only verbal permission . That worried Kroc but did n't deter him . He went ahead and got the Des Plaines drive-in built and opened it in April 1955 , just a year after he 'd seen the first McDonald 's in San Bernardino . It made money virtually right from the start and it gave him a start on something else : all the other problems he 'd never thought of . One problem was the French fries . In Des Plaines , he could n't even begin to duplicate the singular taste of the French fries served in the San Bernardino store , no matter how hard he tried . He did n't know why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him . He phoned the McDonalds repeatedly and had them recheck . He tried everything and still his French fries came out bland and mushy instead of golden-brown and crispy . He went to the Potato &; Onion Association and all he found out was that they were baffled , too . That upset Kroc , because he regarded the French fries as an imperative part of the menu  --  otherwise a very slim menu  --  and he did n't want to reduce them in quality or quantity . Finally he went to a scientific type , a laboratory expert , who found one significant difference : Kroc was storing the potatoes , before use , in a dark place in the basement of his hamburger store , while the McDonalds stored them in chicken-wire bins in an open-roofed area in a shed behind the San Bernardino drive-in . He theorized that the McDonalds ' storage place  --  and the soft desert breezes that blew through and over the open-air bins  --  provided a certain curing effect for the potatoes , drying them out and changing their sugars into starches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's basement . Kroc could n't duplicate the shed in San Bernardino ; there was no room for it on the lot in Des Plaines . So he developed his own curing system , built largely around the use of large electric fans blowing air across the potatoes in the basement . Solving these problems consumed a great deal of time . But one development shook him profoundly : He discovered that the McDonald brothers had previously sold the rights to duplicate their hamburger drive-in within the boundaries of Cook County , Illinois . That is where Chicago is located  --  and Des Plaines and Kroc 's own McDonald 's drive-in . Somehow the McDonalds had never quite gotten around to telling him about this detail . They had gotten $5,000 for selling the Cook County rights , and now , Kroc says , he had to come up with $25,000 to get his drive-in out from under another legal entanglement  --  by buying the Cook County rights from the party that the McDonalds had sold them to . Kroc was long upset , because clearing up the Cook County rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I was in debt for all I was worth already . " But he still had faith  --  in himself , in his ability and in his idea . At first it took enormous patience , because everything went very slowly . Consider : He got the idea in April 1954 . He opened his own McDonald 's Hamburgers place in Des Plaines in April 1955 . In the next year he opened three more , all of them in southern and south-central California , where the drive-in phenomena was commonplace ( and where , therefore , there were fewer risks than if it had been entirely new to them ) . He did not venture to open another one outside of California until May 1956 , some 25 months after he 'd seen the original McDonald 's in San Bernardino . In the last half of 1956 , he opened eight more McDonald 's , and only one of them was in sure-to-be-safe California . Then , in 1957 , he opened  --  through franchises-24 more all over the country . That was a two-a-month pace and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pace increased sharply . In the next 21/4 years , he opened 164 more McDonald 's . Investors began approaching him , clamoring to own a hamburger stand . The cost of a franchise began rising . Today it takes $250,000 to get into business with a McDonald 's . ) It was n't long before Kroc realized he was onto something much bigger than selling Multimixers . Bit by bit , he changed his attitude toward the scope of the business . Clearly he was no longer involved in McDonald 's as a way of trying to develop a market for Multimixers . Yet he hated to give up his job with Multimixers because he liked the security of having a paid job  --  he still was n't taking a salary out of McDonald 's . Finally the time came when he had to give up his job with Multimixers and sell out his interest in the company . McDonald 's was growing so fast that he and his associates were preoccupied with problems of prosperity . For example : ? What do you do when your French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoes ? The answer : McDonald 's began buying out the entire crop of Idaho Russet Burbanks every year . ? How high can you stack hamburger patties  --  when you need scores , even hundreds of them handy in rush periods  --  without having the patties on the bottom crushed ? The answer : Kroc and others at McDonald 's began experimenting with stacks of hamburger patties until we arrived at the optimum height . " Knowing the " optimum height , " they went to the people who made the packages that the hamburger patties were shipped in and got them to make the package to that optimum height . The reason : That would eliminate the step of unloading and restacking the patties in the store ; instead , the package could simply be opened and used as the container to hold the patties as they were used . ? How do you know you 'll have the right pieces of land in the right places for hundreds of future McDonald 's drive-ins when you do n't know precisely how many you 'll need or where or when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain kind of vacant lot all over the country  --  usually in the open spaces in or beyond suburbs  --  and " stockpiling " them until they might be needed . Continued on following page The last strategy offered great opportunities . It allowed McDonald 's to buy up a great deal of property before the prices went sky-high . But the very explosiveness of the growth caused problems . Ray Kroc had to scratch around hard to come up with $1,000 to get the real-estate venture started and in a relatively short time found that his company owned  --  through leverage and a number of ingenious financial devices  --  some $170 million in real estate . The problems this caused were totally unexpected . For one thing , some people began to look at McDonald 's as a company that dealt in real estate , not one that sold hamburgers or sold franchises so that others could sell hamburgers . Almost every penny Kroc  --  or McDonald 's  --  was taking in from the franchises that McDonald 's had already opened was going into real estate for franchises that McDonald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he and the company were cash-poor : He was n't taking much cash out of the operation and neither were the people who worked with him and for him . Not only that : If the company needed cash to handle any other problems , it had difficulty coming up with it in a hurry . Take , for example , the problem of clearing up the contract entanglements between Kroc and the McDonald brothers . From the start , Kroc was aware he 'd made many , many deviations from the original McDonald 's drive-in in San Bernardino and  --  though he 'd gotten verbal permission all the time  --  these deviations put him in violation of the original contract with the McDonald brothers . That raised the possibility that he was completely liable to them legally . He 'd violated the contract and perhaps they could sue  --  and win  --  and put him out of the business . That does n't mean they would do it . It meant only that they could do it . And the possibility left him feeling very insecure . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money out of the company for doing nothing than he was for working 12 to 18 hours a day . So when he heard that the McDonald brothers wanted to retire from running their own drive-in , he thought he 'd help them along . By buying out all their rights in McDonald 's . " How much do you want for them ? " he asked . What they wanted was a million dollars each  --  after taxes . That is n't bad in today 's terms . But this was in the days before McDonald 's had its explosive growth , in the days when McDonald 's was cash-poor . Kroc figured out that it would come to $1.35 million each , or $2.7 total . Neither he nor McDonald 's had that kind of cash . So he had to go out and borrow it , and borrowing is much more expensive than paying cash . The cost of paying off the McDonalds came , in the end , to almost $14 million ( the $2.7 million for them and all the interest charges and other borrowing costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thinks it was worth it on a dollars-and-cents basis . Because their original cut  --  a half-cent on the dollar  --  from the annual sales of the entire McDonald 's system would now come to more than $30 million a year . There were many other problems , and opportunities , of growth , but the most celebrated was Kroc 's decision to " go public " with the company . On the morning in 1963 the stock went on public sale , the asking price was $22.50 a share . Before the end of the day it was up to $30 a share , and in a relatively short time it was up to $50 a share . Kroc suddenly found himself worth hundreds of millions of dollars  --  only a few years after others felt that his prospects and markets were declining and that time was closing in on him . A lot of other people got rich along with Ray Kroc . Some of them got stock early and held on to it . Others became suppliers to McDonald 's and grew with the company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consecutive months and needed a million dollars just to keep his business going  --  not only rebuilt his business but wound up selling 300 million patties of hamburgers to McDonald 's every year . A paper supplier agreed to take on Kroc 's needs for paper for napkins , menus , order forms and sacks ; his company grew so fast that a larger paper company took it over in a merger  --  and the Kroc supplier became chairman of the board of the merged company . Thus Ray Kroc  --  now 77 , a man well recovered from the hazards of his early 50s  --  became a Protean figure : He became to the fast-food industry what Andrew Carnegie was to the steel industry , what Henry Ford was to the auto industry , what John D. Rockefeller , Sr. , was to oil and finance . A dreamer . A visionary . A man of ambition whose idea made him rich , even as it spread and enlarged to bring fulfillment to others who cherished their own dreams .
