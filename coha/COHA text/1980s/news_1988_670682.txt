Although Joxer Daly is generally regarded as a supporting character in Sean O ' Casey ' s " Juno and the Paycock , " as portrayed by John Kavanagh in the Gate Theater Dublin ' s current production , he is the riveting personification of human degradation. // Spouting flowery language and lofty platitudes , a consummate hypocrite who will say anything to gain a moment ' s advantage , Joxer belongs to a long comic tradition of parasitical cowards and cunning fools ; from the Romans to the Elizabethans , the theater is liberally populated with his literary antecedents. // But in Mr. Kavanagh ' s hands , Joxer is also decidedly sinister . Not for a moment can one dismiss him as a harmless fool , and in the chilling images of the play ' s closing moments he achieves an unforgettable stature as an emblematic figure of evil , leaving one with goose-bumps as the curtain comes down . <> <> Kempt , Firm-Jawed // It comes as something of a shock to encounter Mr. Kavanagh in real life . Clad in clean clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tangled wisps of the unkempt wig he wears onstage , he stands gracefully erect instead of hunched down in Joxer ' s crablike crouch , perpetually poised to scuttle for cover . His very face assumes a different shape offstage : slack-jawed and wet-lipped , Joxer ' s mouth gapes moronically ; Mr. Kavanagh ' s jaw is firm and taut , albeit stubbled with the three-day growth required by his role. // It is a role Mr. Kavanagh has lived with for a long time . " Juno and the Paycock , " which has been playing to standing ovations every night at the Golden Theater , is here under the auspices of the First New York International Festival of the Arts . But the current cast has performed together for more than two years , taking " Juno " from Dublin to Edinburgh to Jerusalem. // Although the production has been acclaimed elsewhere , the cast has been startled by its fervent reception in New York . " People are so in tune with the play it ' s uncanny , " said Mr. Kavanagh . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could have sworn they ' d imported 500 Dubliners . We ' re getting more laughs here than I thought existed. " // In the play , Joxer is the ever-present sidekick to Captain Boyle , a drunken blowhard who spends his time roistering in pubs with Joxer instead of working to support his increasingly desperate family . Mr. Kavanagh ' s partnership with Donal McCann , who plays Captain Boyle , goes back even further than the Gate Theater production ; Mr. Kavanagh and Mr. McCann teamed up to play Joxer and the Captain in a BBC radio version of " Juno " more than a dozen years ago. // " It really is a double act , " Mr. Kavanagh said . " They ' re a bit like Laurel and Hardy , the two of them . There has to be great rapport between Joxer and the Captain . They ' re like a husband and wife - the kind of close relationship that leads to endless squabbles but where the affection is always there . They ' re great companions . " <> <> A Mesmerizing Transformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to transform himself into Joxer Daly is profound ; at one recent performance , he drooled so prolifically that a foot-long pendulum of spittle swung from his lips , mesmerizing the audience as it grew longer by the moment . Mr. Kavanagh didn ' t even notice it was there until it dropped to the ground. // Although it is impossible to guess Joxer ' s age , he looks eons older than Mr. Kavanagh , who is 42 . The actor cites the miserable poverty of the characters in the play , which was set in 1922 . " There were a lot of slum dwellings in Dublin at the time that were on a par with Calcutta , " said Mr. Kavanagh , a fourth-generation Dubliner . " People looked much older than they were because of abuse , alcohol , malnutrition and very rough living. " // " Juno and the Paycock " was first presented in 1924 at the Abbey Theater in Dublin . Half a century later , Mr. Kavanagh himself was a member of the company . He came to the theater via what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in a family with " no connection to the theater whatever . " <> <> Discovered ' Dormant Ability ' // Mr. Kavanagh , whose father drove a laundry truck , wanted to be a film technician ; after reading that somebody who had attended a Dublin acting academy had landed a job in film production , he enrolled in the same program . " Anything to do with the technical side of film production or transmission fascinated me , " he said . " I had no intention of becoming an actor , but while I was at the academy I discovered this dormant ability . I had been a kind of solitary child , and it was a good release. " // Mr. Kavanagh went on to enroll in the Abbey Theater ' s acting school , becoming a member of the company in 1967 . There , he performed a wide variety of roles , from Sheridan and Shakespeare to Stoppard , but after a decade of repertory work he was ready to move on . " I was constantly rehearsing a play , so I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , and finally I felt I had to , " he explained . " It seemed like the least opportune time to make a decision like that and take a drop in salary ; I was newly married and had just acquired a mortgage , but I also had the feeling , if you don ' t do it now , you ' re never going to. " // Mr. Kavanagh made the leap successfully ; since leaving the company , he has found steady work - " too much , " he said . He and his wife , a former airline stewardess , now have three children , and the mortgage that seemed so forbidding 11 years ago has dwindled to a level Mr. Kavanagh shrugs off with a smile . He can afford to ; these days he is in demand not only onstage but in television and film as well. // But Joxer Daly has marked a milestone in his career , and Mr. Kavanagh retains an amused affection for his character , despicable though he may be . " I quite like him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very funny , and I admire him - for surviving , living on his wits . He ' s all things to all men ; he ' ll say whatever is necessary to placate or to get something . He ' s a rogue , but he ' s a beggar . He really has absolutely nothing . When you ' re starving to death , there are very few principles. " //
