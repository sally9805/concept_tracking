 | Robert Nisbet is by all odds the jolliest Jeremiah now practicing . In person , as in his books , he dwells on the dire condition of our society with unfailing zest , brightening with his style the gloomy landscape he portrays . One is apt to leave the company of this tall , ruddy , 69-year-old remembering that he favors jogging shoes and feeling that things just can not be as bad as he says . Since 1978 , when emeritus was added to his title of Albert Schweitzer professor of the humanities at Columbia University ? " I was fed to the teeth with teaching " ? Nisbet has been continuing his explorations of the territory where sociology , intellectual history , moral philosophy and political science meet . The titles ? of a few of his books suggest the breadth of his interests ? " History of the Idea of Progress , " " Twilight of Authority , " " The Social Bond . " His latest book , * unencumbered by scholarly apparatus , presents in lively takes aspects of America that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , for the intense subjectivity of our " modern age of self-spelunking , ego diving and awareness intoxication , " where schools stint on history and geography in favor of " psychobabble " about " self-development , realization of potential , sexual and psychosexual fulfillment , meditation awareness . " You do n't have to be a conservative to cheer as he knocks about fads like sociobiology , psychohistory and futurology . But his favorite targets are liberals . American liberalism , in Nisbet 's diagnosis , is " blatantly schizoid . " One impulse is to channel as much power as possible to Washington ; the other to permit as much license as possible to disturbers of the social order , among whom he includes " fully liberated women , " homosexuals and sniffers of cocaine . To him , the liberal is at once a " lover of political power " and " the knee-jerk adversary of all moral authority , " too soft on the socially aberrant and too scornful of the feelings of ordinary folk . Nisbet charges that liberalism , using the undemocratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social relationships that binds together a wholesome society . Nisbet confesses to having been a fervent New Dealer until 1939 , when he encountered the works of Edmund Burke and Alexis de Toqueville and was redeemed . They taught him to prize common human relationships and to be wary of excessive power whether it is exercised by the elite or the mob . In Nisbet 's preferred society , power is diffused , rules are fuzzy . The family ? " the sworn enemy of the state " ? is revered , and religion is important . ( Nisbet 's first marriage ended in divorce ; he lives with his second wife in a pleasant apartment on Washington 's Wisconsin Avenue . As for religion ? " I tried it , but it did n't take . " ) The essence of Nisbet 's conservatism is " the protection of the social order ? family , neighborhood , local community and region foremost ? from the ravishments of the centralized political state . " He concedes that if community forces had prevailed in the South , its schools would still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? yet maintains that voluntary social ties are the only effective buffer between the individual and the engorged state . He traces today 's social and political disarray to the destruction since the Middle Ages of traditional communities and the rise of totalitarianism . That theme is central to his work over the past three decades , beginning with " The Quest for Community " in 1953 . Nisbet is very much a part of today 's conservative intellectual establishment . When Ronald Reagan assumed the presidency , Nisbet joined other Reagan supporters such as Irving Kristol , Midge Decter and George Gilder in a symposium for the conservative journal Public Opinion ; his advice to the new president was to rely as much as possible on " indirect government " ; that is , on groups of ordinary citizens rather than the official bureaucracy . Although Nisbet is pleased that conservatism seems to be resurgent , he is not optimistic about its staying power . The efforts to cut big government down to size make him think of " chipmunks trying to bring down a giant redwood . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the liberalism of statism and ofcultural license , " he does n't care for those " self-styled conservatives who are more interested in capturing the state , or a part of it at least , as the means of imposing a given moral value upon the entire nation . " In one of the few essays in his new " Dictionary " that can give comfort to liberals , Nisbet parts decisively from the Moral Majority on the issue of abortion . It is not that he likes abortion more , but that he likes trespassers on the family 's domain less . Although he is repelled by the " zeal in behalf of killing one 's own fetus , " that does not seem as grave a threat as the one posed by the aggressive pro-lifers : " In denying the right of the woman or of her family to terminate pregnancy , these soldiers of righteousness strike at the very heart ofboth family and individual rights . " Kinship : How does a conservative come to such a position ? Drawing on Christian tradition from Saint Augustine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important , as is the fetus . But the importance of both lies solely within the perspective of development , which does not become real until its telos , its end or purpose , is realized . " His deepest objection to the pro-lifers , however , is less theological than political . When religious enthusiasts combine with political enthusiasts , he shudders , " God help us all ' " He warns that a school-prayer amendment would inevitably bring Big Brother into the classroom , believes that the reaction against pornography has been excessive and laments the increasingly strident nationalism abroad in the land . The Burkean consen ative shakes his white-fringed head : " I feel no kinship with the far right . " Nisbet is resigned to the fact that the kind of society he cherishes , where citizens join together to deal with their mutual problems and bureaucrats mind their own business , is out of America 's reach : " I do n't see an ) future for conservatism .
