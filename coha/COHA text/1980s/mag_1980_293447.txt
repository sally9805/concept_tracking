HAPPY NEW YEAR <P> Made into a Musical and Directed by Burt Shevelove <P> Nature tries to avoid genetic mutations . Broadway will hybridize anything if it looks like box-office loot . Burt Shevelove , a clever and intelligent man , obviously had a dream collaboration in mind when he thought of mating some svelte Cole Porter songs with Philip Barry 's sophisticated play Holiday . <P> What has happened ? The Porter score has been excised from several disparate musicals and fitted with procrustean zeal to the Barry play . Holiday has been shred ded , which necessitates a narrator to fill in the gaps . Though he plays this role with guileful urbanity , John McMartin can not wholly disguise the fact that , except in the case of Our Town , a narrator is the way a show takes a sleeping pill . Those who have seen the 1938 Gary Grant-Katharine Hepburn movie version of Holiday will recall that this is the tale of a stuffy rich girl , Julia ( played here by Kimberly Farr ) , with a perky , venturesome sister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julia gets affianced to Johnny Case ( Michael Scott ) , the Grant role , an up-and-coming stockbroker with the revolutionary notion of retiring and savoring the world while young , and working later . When he sticks to his plan , Julia ditches him and Linda elopes with him . <P> Vintage Porter numbers always delight , and one torchy lament ( After You Who ? ) deserves to be heard more often Valiant work is done by all acting hands especially by Denniston as the ardently fetching Linda , but this quasi musical is about as happy as a depleted New Year 's dawn when it seems to be raining incessantly inside your skull .
