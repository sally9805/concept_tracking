Rightists ride triumphant , but the nominee must widen his appeal to win Imagine this colloquy among Republican leaders as they gather around the celestial TV set to watch their party 's convention . Theodore Roosevelt : It 's a bully sight ! Calvin Coolidge : Too expensive . Mark Hanna : Not much excitement . I ca n't see a single smoke-filled room . Henry Cabot Lodge : I 'm worried about the westward tilt of the party . The East always supplied the intellectual leadership . T.R. : If I had not gone West . . . Coolidge : What 's all this talk about winning the blue-collar vote ? America 's business is business . Abraham Lincoln : Do n't forget that the workingman 's vote helped to elect the first Republican President . When we were trying to preserve the nation , the Republicans became known as the Union Party . The name is gone , but the meaning should still prevail . <P> Ronald Reagan is an old hand at theatricals , but nothing in his long career can compare with the four-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After many years of tryouts , he is the Republican Party 's superstar . His folksy conservatism , with its tinge of Western populism , not only swept the Republican primaries but appears to be attracting other parts of the electorate as well . Scenting that victory might indeed be theirs , the Republicans are closing ranks behind their new standardbearer . Though some are still wary of his politics , others envision Reagan 's launching a new Republican era in America . <P> To try to lure as many viewers as possible for 18 hours of TV time , the convention is overflowing with show business celebrities who will rival the politicians on the rostrum-a far cry from oldtime conventions where delegates lustily bargained , brawled and demonstrated to choose a nominee . This time there will be Pat Boone to pledge allegiance to the flag , Glen Campbell and Tanya Tucker to sing the national anthem . Other contributions will be offered by Jimmy Stewart , Vikki Carr , Dorothy Hamill , Ginger Rogers , Donny and Marie Osmond . And the national anthem once again by Princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will set the tone by word , gesture and command . It is his show , and he calls the shots . <P> The biggest of all , of course , is his selection of a running mate . His choice will indicate where he intends to lead the party that has now put him in charge . Picking a relative moderate like George Bush with close ties to the Eastern Establishment would give a clear signal that he wants to broaden the G.O.P. base as much as possible . A compromise selection like Indiana Senator Richard Lugar would indicate a certain caution . Choosing an old friend like Nevada Senator Paul Laxalt would show that he plans to run a far more narrowly based campaign-with all the risks that implies in November .
