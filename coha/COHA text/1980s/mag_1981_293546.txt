Maggie 's Woes <P> <P> To the Editors : <P> So Britain 's socialists think they have all the answers to their nation 's economic problems Feb. 16 . By throwing out Margaret Thatcher , they will be losing their last real hope . Would the unemployment , inflation and unrest really disappear if Thatcher left , or would it stay and flourish under Karl Marx II ? <P> John A. Heldt <P> Eugene , Ore . <P> <P> Are the " frightening doctrines " of the left wing any worse than those of a government that is responsible for 10% unemployment , double-digit inflation and a crippled ( and still declining ) economy ? <P> Richard K. Edwards <P> Durham , N.H. <P> <P> Your assessment of Britain 's economic and political difficulties must not be allowed to remain flawed by the statement that Liberals have " never " held power . Gladstone , Asquith and Lloyd George were among the Prime Ministers who headed Liberal or Liberal-dominated governments .
