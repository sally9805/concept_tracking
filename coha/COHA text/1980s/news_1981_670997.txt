The Koreans asked for $6 billion in economic aid from Japan to finance a new five-year development plan that is due to start in 1982 . The Japanese were offered a vastly expanded role in South Korea , if they chose it. // They did not ; only small increases in the current aid of $83 million a year are contemplated . Their decision to rebuff the aid request says a good deal about Japan today , not only in its relations with South Korea but in its foreign policy as a whole. // Since about the mid-1960 ' s , when Japan ' s economic success began to have an impact abroad , many people concluded that this country had beaten its swords into plowshares and had turned its back on a distant militaristic past . <> <> Reluctant to Take Wider Role // It was also widely assumed that it would be only a matter of time before Japan sought political influence commensurate with its economic power . An obvious sphere of influence for Japan was not only Southeast Asia but also the much closer region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Korea. // That was not to be . The Japanese were cautious about seeking a wider role in Asia . When Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka visited Indonesia in 1974 and was met with big anti-Japanese demonstrations in Jakarta , those here who had urged a " low posture " in diplomacy felt more than justified. // Japan practiced an " omnidirectional diplomacy " that was based on avoiding giving offense anywhere . This policy produced enormous success in export sales , so that when Japan was hit by the oil crisis of 1973 , it was able to increase its exports by 50 percent in a year to help pay the mounting bill for oil imports. // Not all of this success was attributable simply to a quiet , lowkey neutralism . The dynamism of Japanese export industries was such that exports were almost bound to increase . <> <> Little Military Spending // But to a remarkable degree Japan managed to avoid offending anyone . One reason , it was felt here , was that Japan spent little on its armed forces , thus offering no military threat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgings from Washington and later from China - after the signing of a peace treaty with Peking in the summer of 1978 - that they step up military spending . After the Soviet move into Afghanistan at the end of 1979 and the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia , the pressures from Washington increased. // But there has been no appreciable response . The only power with which Japan has cool relations is the Soviet Union , largely because of the Russians ' refusal to return four islands off Japan ' s northern island of Hokkaido that were seized at the end of World War II. // Then came the South Koreans last week , with Foreign Minister Lho Shin Young asking his Japanese counterpart , Sunao Sonoda , to increase economic aid 14-fold on the argument that Japan ' s security was heavily dependent on South Korea . <> <> Threat From North Stressed // Mr. Lho urged the Japanese to recognize the threat to South Korea posed by President Kim Il Sung ' s regime in the North . The response here was tantamount to deafness in diplomatic terms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks that said security in South Korea was a matter of mutual concern. // The South Koreans were unhappy , and the Seoul press accused Japan of " double-dealing diplomacy . " " Japan has had no clearly defined policy toward the Korean peninsula , " said Chosun Ilbo , a leading paper . " Japan obviously has assumed that it is in its interest not to have an articulate policy on its role in Northeast Asia. " // Japanese diplomats quietly demurred . Tokyo will increase economic aid to South Korea , they said . Cadets from South Korea ' s military academy will be invited here . Cultural ties will be strengthened , and a center for Japanese studies will be opened at a major university in Seoul . <> <> Premier Burned in Effigy // But the Japanese are not moving very far very fast . Late last year Japan ' s Prime Minister , Zenko Suzuki , was burned in effigy in Seoul before a crowd estimated at 100 , 000 . Such memories are not conducive to close ties. // The occasion of the anti-Japanese ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Japanese interference in South Korean affairs . The Japanese Government had quietly protested President Chun Doo Hwan ' s prosecution of the opposition leader and dissident Kim Dae Jung. // But these problems are apparently not the chief basis for Japan ' s refusal to move closer to South Korea . The Japanese no longer make an issue of the Kim case , at least not in public . What then lies behind their reserve toward South Korea when friends and allies - not least the United States - urge them to take a bigger role in Asia ? <> <> No Consensus for Military Growth // The best explanation is self-interest . Japan is doing well as things stand , so why rock the boat with foreign adventures ? Japan is defended by the United States , which has 45 , 000 servicemen here . Rapid rearmament could set alarm bells ringing in Asia . Even though right-wing members of the governing Liberal Democratic Party and some leading businessmen favor rearmament , there is no consensus here in favor of a big military budget . Japan spends less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces , which is far below the average of European allies of the United States. // But avoidance of an active diplomacy backed by arms is still - 36 years after the end of World War II - felt to be the path of wisdom . " The truth is that we have no foreign policy , " a Foreign Ministry official said here a few days ago . He was not exaggerating very much. //
