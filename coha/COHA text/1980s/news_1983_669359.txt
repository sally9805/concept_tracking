It follows the evening news like pudding after a TV dinner : A young , fresh-faced couple walks the living-room audience through the latest local fads , meets people with oddball hobbies , joins wacky local contests , and chats with local celebrities. // And they keep the conversation as light as whipped cream and Jell-O for an audience already sated with the day ' s newscast. // TV executives call it ' ' reality programming , ' ' like the news . But it isn ' t exactly news . Some call it ' ' info-tainment , ' ' meaning information that is entertaining . Others call it ' ' docu-schlock. ' ' // Whatever one calls it , shows like this have swept the airwaves . By now , the local channels nearly everywhere in the country carry at least one soft-feature , magazine-style TV show. // It was all Bill Hillier ' s idea. // He conceived it as clever way out of a jam , but it has proved to be a versatile creature - so far - in all kinds of television markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Hillier , a Harvard-educated former documentary producer with a doctorate from the Carnegie Institute of Technology , was programming director for KPIX , the local CBS station . The station was concerned about its ratings in the half-hour slot following the national news. // In TV-programming jargon , this slot is ' ' prime-time access . ' ' The Federal Communications Commission ruled in the early ' 70s that the networks must leave this half-hour of prime time free for local programs. // A little ironically , local stations had promptly filled their ' ' prime-time access ' ' with syndicated game shows like ' ' Family Feud ' ' and ' ' The Newlywed Game . ' ' KPIX was no exception , and it led the local ratings for the 7 : 30-to-8 p. m. time slot. // But it was slipping . Mr. Hillier sensed people were getting tired of game shows . And game shows were getting more expensive to buy , putting pressure on the station ' s budget just as ratings were weakening. // The idea came as he was flipping through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slick , city-based magazines like Boston , New York , and Los Angeles Magazines . His concept was to translate the city-magazine premise onto the TV screen. // A few years earlier , this would have been an expensive notion . But in 1976 , TV minicams were just coming into their own . Using these shoulder-held cameras , on-location filming became virtually as easy as walking around town , and cheaper than studio production. // The minicam made the magazine premise practical . The format could tap into viewers ' appetite for information about their own locale , use as many visual settings as a crew could visit , and still meet the station ' s budget. // ' ' Evening Magazine ' ' was popular enough in San Francisco its first year that Westinghouse , which owns KPIX , began airing it on the company ' s other stations in Boston , Pittsburgh , Philadelphia , and Baltimore . Each station produced some of its own local segments to splice in with the show ' s fare from San Francisco. // It was an idea whose time had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In its third year , the show was rechristened ' ' PM Magazine ' ' and was syndicated to 46 stations around the country under a cooperative arrangement . Stations substituted their own local stories as they saw fit and sent in at least one video story a week for consideration in the national package. // The next year , ' ' PM ' ' was on 106 stations . It became the most highly syndicated first-run show in the country , trailing only ' ' M*A*S*H* ' ' reruns. // Flocks of ' ' PM Magazine ' ' clones started taking to the airwaves . Now at least 125 stations and all three networks produce their own versions of the PM-style format. // In Los Angeles , ' ' Eye on LA ' ' and ' ' Two on the Town ' ' do fierce battle every week-night to gain the edge in audience share . ' ' PM Magazine ' ' itself airs just afterward. // ' ' Real People , ' ' ' ' That ' s Incredible , ' ' ' ' Ripley ' s Believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' ' ' ' Hour Magazine , ' ' and a host of others are all variations on the theme Bill Hillier founded. // ' ' These magazine shows are a bonanza for the people who produce them , ' ' remarks Joe Saltzman , chairman of broadcast journalism at the University of Southern California . ' ' They cost a fraction of what an entertainment production takes. ' ' // What concerns Mr. Saltzman is that audiences trust these shows like news programs , but the programs are produced with entertainment standards , rather than news standards . ' ' It ' s the general attitude that ' we don ' t have to be fair , because we ' re not news. ' ' ' // However balanced and accurate , the magazine shows are a hit. // Can it last ? Will these snappy three- to six-minute segments on juvenile sidewalk dancers , skyscraper parachutists , and soap-star Linda Evans start wearing thin ? // There is such talk . Hillier himself says the form has passed its peak and needs fresh air , just as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the questions we have to ask ourselves all the time , ' ' admits Mary Kellogg-Joslyn , programming director of the Los Angeles station that produces ' ' Two on the Town. ' ' // So many ' ' PM ' ' look-alikes have appeared and newscasts have expanded so far into the soft-feature domain of the magazine show ( since it ' s so cheap to produce ) that - says ' ' PM ' s ' ' executive producer Dick Crew - ' ' You ' ve got people doing ' PM ' ahead of us , doing ' PM ' behind us , and doing ' PM ' against us. ' ' // Now only 75 stations produce the show cooperatively and another 20 smaller ones just buy the national package intact. // ' ' People watch TV in funny ways , ' ' notes Mr. Crew . At 10 p. m. , he explains , people are more apt to sit and stare at the television . But at 7 : 30 or 8 p. m. , they are more likely to watch while doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settling-down period . People are paying about three-quarters of their attention , and the show needs to punch through what ' s going on in the time period. ' ' // ' ' PM ' s ' ' response : a shift to shorter , punchier segments ; getting cutting-edge trend stories before the competition picks them up ; adventure stories ; and Hollywood celebrities. // Crew has found an ' ' incredible appetite ' ' among viewers for Hollywood stories . ' ' We went to the well on ' Flashdance ' about five times , ' ' he recalls , doing segments on the movie itself and , successively , its impact on fashion , dance , exercise , and music. // Bill Hillier has applied the magazine recipe to a handful of new programs since he left ' ' PM Magazine ' ' in 1980 . Currently he is producing ' ' EPCOT Magazine ' ' - a family-oriented show specializing in innovative ideas - for the Disney Channel on cable TV. // ' ' Content is the key , ' ' says Hillier . For a magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To this end , some eight staff members at Hillier Productions search out story ideas full-time with the use of several computer data banks. // The great-ideas premise of ' ' EPCOT Magazine ' ' makes stories easy to come by anyway , he says . An earlier Hillier effort , ' ' World of People , ' ' folded because it simply ran out of the kind of events it presented. // Lawrence Taymor , ' ' EPCOT Magazine ' s ' ' producer , is a veteran of many magazine shows and their mad scramble for fresh story ideas . ' ' I ' ve produced every story I see on those shows , ' ' or one very similar to it , Mr. Taymor says . First it ' s the Great Chili Cook-off , he says , and next it ' s the Great Chili and Onion Cook-off. // After three years with Los Angeles ' s ' ' Two on the Town , ' ' executive producer Kevin Meagher says the prime liability of the profession is that the staff has no life outside the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a good restaurant , ' ' he says , ' ' and the first thing you think of is : ' This would make a good segment.
