 | " He 's going to try , " a woman said . " Can you imagine , he 's going to try . " Try what ? " " What do you think ? To get in through the other building ! " " I do n't believe it . It 's impossible ! He 'd be crazy ! " " Then he 's crazy . " " My God , look there ! Up there ! " The young man was at the top-floor window , next to the burning building . Astride the sill , he swung a leg out into the air . " What does he  --  how does he think he can ? " The onlookers seemed to be whispering with that single voice again . A foot searched for a place on the narrow cornice . It was a tin cornice ; above it stood the numbers 1889 . A hand went out and groped , testing the fragile scroll on the flat , fake-classic pillar , a crude bas-relief in crumbling stone . The hand drew back . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl said to herself . Her breath held in her throat . The smoke was thickening . It wreathed and curled in the scurrying wind ; the fire was now making a wind of its own , which met the winds from the river , from the four corners of the earth , and fought them , swirling the smoke so that the man was almost hidden in it . He changed to a sitting position on the sill . For a moment he sat quite still ; his legs hung down ; he wore green corduroy trousers . Then , as if he had finally made his decision , he twisted off from the sill , with his back to the street , his toes on the cornice , his hands on the sill . By hand and foot he clung to the moldering stone . " Oh , let it hold ! Let it not break off and send him smashing to the street ! " The girl 's neck ached ; tense with the strain of peering upward , she felt herself in that young man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance between the buildings . It was too long even for the long legs of such a tall man  --  for , even from where she stood , she could see that he was tall . So he would need to slide to the edge of the building and then jump , which he must have known from the start , just as the fireman had known . " Come back . . . do n't try . . . come back . " In the burning house the windows had begun to melt ; the shattered glass fell with a musical tinkle . Cinders and shreds of burned cloth rained gently to the street .  | Somebody spoke behind the girl . " No one can be alive in there . " " It 's not worth risking his life ? " His hand must have seized some small projection . Inch by inch he slid along the stone face , past the window . Far up , through the screen of smoke , they could see him , could sense that again he was measuring distance , positioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assessing his balance or maybe arguing with himself as to whether it made any sense at all to try . You ca n't do it , do n't you see you ca n't ? Silence . A horse neighed . Silence . Somebody coughed . The girl 's heart hammered . I will be sick if he falls . I should look away . Look away now ! But she could not . " It wo n't hold , " said the talkative woman at the girl 's back . I wish you would shut up , she thought in fury . A piece of burned paper wrapped itself like a cat or a snake around her ankle , but she did not feel it . She was feeling the fall to the street , the unspeakable seconds while the pavement rushed up . Her full lips fell open . " Oh , God , " she whispered . He leapt . The extended arm and the leg shot across the air-space . The hand grasped ; one could imagine the straining muscles of the arms and the fingernails going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning building and clung until the rest of the body , curving outward into space , could follow and right itself and steady itself . Again the girl closed her eyes . She had a fragment of thought : No one is thinking of the child inside , even I am thinking instead of him . When she opened her eyes , he was standing flat on the cornice of the burning building , inching himself toward the window . Do n't look down . If you look you will fall . . . . " Thank God the window is open , " the girl whispered aloud . What would have happened had it been closed ? She had not thought of that . And she wondered whether the young man had not thought of it either . He swung himself inside . And a babble of relief and amazement broke out . " My God , how brave ! " " Who is he ? Do you know ? " " The smoke will kill him . " " It sears the lungs . All you need are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone left alive in there . "  | " Make way ! Get back , get out of the way , dammit ! " Now they were bringing up a net . A dozen men came forward to hold it . " Dammit , out of the way ! " They waited . " Ca n't survive in there . It sears the lungs . " And then he appeared at the window . He was holding someone : female , with a flapping skirt . She was not a baby : a grown child , then ? He let go . The body hurtled through the air with a scream that tore the air , and bounced safe in the net , and bounced once more and was lifted out . A great cheer went up . Then the young man , flinging out his arms , jumped too , like a boy going feetfirst into the East River on a summer day . Another great cheer of relief and release went up ; laughing and clapping , the crowd pushed forward toward the hero . But it was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No child imploring and helpless in its crib , only a very old and ugly , hairyfaced woman whimpering , with a few years left to live . Was it worth the risk of his life ? And yet we are taught , she thought seriously , for she was a serious believer , that he who saves one life , saves the whole world . Still , if it had been a child 's life ? Well , it is done . He did it . They had cornered him . Close to the smoking tenement , in front of a small wooden house out of the century past , he stood now panting and coughing , squeezed between a cigar-store Indian and a barber pole from which the gilded ball had been knocked off by the swinging fire hose . Thrilled and curious , the crowd pressed close to touch him and stare . Reporters were already there with notebook , pencil , and a hundred questions . Who was he ? Where did he live ? Why had he done it ? " What difference does my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because somebody had to . That 's as good a reason as any , is n't it ? " Exhausted , he still stood straight . The girl was enthralled . A king going past in a gilded coach would have been no more enthralling . From far off , between the crowding heads , she stood and saw : vivid eyes , high cheekbones , a lock of waving hair , thick as a mane , that he kept pushing back off his forehead . His shirt is torn and his hands are bleeding . He wants to be let alone . I would not bother you so . Go home and rest , I would say . You are the most wonderful . . . go home and rest , my dear .  | " Well , sonny , what did you think of that brave man ? " an old fellow asked Paul as they walked away . " I could do that , " Paul said gravely . " Well , that 's a good one ! That 's the way to talk ! Yessir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow up ! How old are you ? " " Four , " Paul answered . They crossed the street and Paul whispered , " He thought you were my mother , Aunt Hennie . " " I know . " It was not unusual for people to think Paul was her child when they were out together . She wished he were . There was something between them that had nothing to do with age . She could look years and years into the future and see them caring about each other . It was not a thing she talked of ; people would find it silly . But it was true , all the same . Who is this girl going home through the gathering afternoon ? Her eyes tell of her that she is solitary and that she dreams . They are the distinguishing feature in a round , pleasant , otherwise undistinguished face . Leaf-shaped , they are the color of brown autumn and they match the curling hair that escapes under the brim of her feathered hat . She is eighteen years old and seems older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how you came to be so big . There 's never been anyone with your frame in my family or in your father 's either , as far as I know . Her name is Henrietta De Rivera . She lives with her family in a decent apartment house east of Washington Square 's fine private brownstones , with their stoops and mounting blocks and polished railings . Her address is near enough to these things to be respectable , but too far from them to be fashionable . On three days a week , she walks to work as a volunteer at a settlement house downtown . She teaches English to immigrants , tries also to teach them to bathe , and tries not to mind their clothes , which are sometimes very dirty , for she understands how hard it is to find the time or place for cleanliness . Her work is called " assimilation of the immigrant into American life . " Some of these people do not want to be entirely assimilated into the ways of families like the De Riveras , but the De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an embarrassment . Hennie is naturally aware of all that , but she does not agree with it . She does not feel superior ; she feels , rather , a deep kinship . Indeed , the closest friend she  | has  --  and she has not ever had many  --  comes not out of the group in which she has grown up , but is a pupil in one of her English classes , an immigrant sweatshop worker only a few years older than she . Hennie would like to be a volunteer nurse like Lillian Wald . Her parents , though , will not allow her to take training . Nor will they let her do any other labor for pay . To receive pay would make it seem that her father was unable to support her ! A young lady does not work for money , even , Hennie thinks , when her family could certainly use it . But she does not say so . It is one of the many things she thinks but does not say . " You sighed , Aunt Hennie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm tired , I guess . Are you tired ? Are you hungry ? We 've had a long walk , but there 'll be time for cocoa at my house before your mama comes for you . " They were passing through Washington Square . Sparrows filled the brisk air with anxious twittering . Two little girls clattered their hoops against the railings , making a rat-a-tat like drums . A lady stepped out of her carriage , holding a little white dog , and smiled at Paul . " It 's pretty here , " Paul said . He looked up at the dome of trees , now only sparsely leaved ; his little face was earnest ; the sky , seen through the leaves , must be a wonderment to him , Hennie thought . Perhaps he is trying to see God up there , as I used to do . He was thinking not of God , but of Hennie . He was thinking , although he did not have the words , that he liked the hush among these houses , and the colors , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was allowed to visit for a day or a night . She was so nice ! She was different ; he could think of the rest of his family as " they " apart from " her , " and could love them all , for no one was ever unkind to him , yet she was different . She never said : " Do n't bother me right now " or " Later , Paul , I 'm busy . " When she took him to the park , which was n't that often , usually on Fraulein 's Thursday out , it was so much better to see her sit there watching him play , than to see Fraulein scowling over her knitting . She was always knitting some ugly gray thing for her nieces and nephews . " Komm jetzt/ Schne ! l zuriick ! " she would call , sounding angry ; she was n't really angry , but her voice made it sound that way , like a bark . He laughed , thinking of Fraulein barking like a dog . So Aunt Hennie  | was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , although he suspected he was n't supposed to think that . Mama did n't scold , but she was n't all that much fun . You could hardly ever get on her lap because of wrinkles : Be careful , darling ; you 'll wrinkle my skirt . Of course , he was almost five , and really did n't want to sit on anybody 's lap very much ; only sometimes , when he was tired , it was a good thing to do . He could always sit on Aunt Hennie 's lap , though . She would read to him about Little Orphant Annie , and then there was the one about the " funny little fellow of the very purest type , for he had a heart as mellow as an apple overripe . " That 's called " poetry " when it rhymes like fellow and mellow . Aunt Hennie would hug him . " Guess who the funny little fellow is , " she would say , and he would tell her he could n't guess , although he did know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opening her eyes wide with the surprise , and she would hug him again . " Did you like that man ? " he asked her now . For a moment she could not think whom he meant . " The man who climbed up on the roof , do you mean ? " " Yes . Did you like him ? I did . " " Yes , he was wonderful . " " I could do that , " Paul said again . She touched his head . " I do n't know that you could ever do that . Hardly anybody could . " She believed in being honest with a child . " But I do believe you will do many wonderful things . " " What will I do ? " " You will learn a lot because you look carefully and you listen . You will understand beautiful things . And you will be very kind . Now let 's hurry . They must be wondering where we are . " The tea service was out on its heavy tray ; Hennie 's mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought ; they know they are making a picture . Florence must have brought the roses . She always brought them , never too many , only enough to create a perfection of pink and cream in a small silver bowl . " Paul must have his cocoa , " said Angelique , the grandmother . " And then you may take him home , Florence . " They had been comfortably chatting . The arrival of Hennie and Paul  | having interrupted the flow of the chat , there was a short silence while thoughts were once again collected . " This is such a lovely room , " Florence said . " All your beautiful things , Mama . " Angelique shook her head . " They belong in a proper setting . Not here . " It was true . These portraits , the lace curtains fine as a bride 's veil , these Dresden dukes and duchesses bowing to each other on the whatnot , were too grand for such ordinary rooms . They recalled high ceilings , columns , and verandas . They were from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped at Appomattox , eight years before Hennie was born . How , then , could she still hear its cries and clamor in her head ? It was because Angelique made them vivid . Papa , who had gone through four years of war , almost never spoke of it , nor did Great Uncle David , who had gone through even worse , though , as Angelique always said , on the wrong side . But how she clung to that old war ! She wore sorrow and anger like a worn-out coat and would not throw it away . Perhaps she could not . Perhaps in some peculiar way it protected her . " Yes , it was a sorry day when we came to New York , " Angelique said now . She stood up and went to the window , to which she was drawn a dozen times a day . " They say it will be an early winter . All those heaps of dirty melting snow to look forward to . " The bleakness of the imagined wintry street was reflected in her handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to sag . " Oh , when I think of the places where I grew up ! Our lovely sheltered garden in New Orleans , with the fountain trickling ! " Her voice lamented that lost , privileged charm . " Lawns and lawns all the way to the river at Beau Jardin before the war ! Parties and servants . . . " Slaves , but she would never use the word . And her swift hand dismissed the little parlor that Florence , however charitably , had praised , and the kitchen in which the latest Irish maid was humming and chopping , the hall with Papa 's bookcases  --  dismissed them with a gesture . " It 's dark in here , " Hennie said , finding it all unbearable . She lit the gas ; the blue flame hissed and jetted . The marble clock , suspended between gilt Corinthian columns , chimed the hour . Florence stood up . " Come , Paul . Time to go home . " " We had a good time , Paul and I , " Hennie told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried , " and gulls . They dive for fish in the river . " " We always have a good time , " Hennie said . " That I know . " It was never clear whether Florence minded or not . From the window Angelique watched her daughter and grandson ride away in their polished black carriage , behind the coachman in brass buttons and the fine pair of matching grays . She sighed again . " Your father is coming down the street . Open the door so he wo n't have to fumble with his keys . . . . You 're home early , Henry ! " " There was n't much doing downtown . " Too often there was not . Papa had been waiting to prosper ever since he and Wendell Hughes had come north and opened their office in the cotton district near Hanover Square . Papa was gray : gray cloth suit , skin , and faded hair . The sight of him pained Hennie . " Not enough capital , " he would say , " that 's the trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're managing , but it 's not what I had in mind , God knows . I sometimes feel I am failing you , Angelique . " Hennie watched him all through the dinner . He ate silently . She wondered whether he heard half of her mother 's and her brother 's animated talk . Alfie could always amuse his mother . " ? so Mr. Hemmings turned around to see where the spitball came from , it hit the back of his neck , all squooshy , a real wet one ? " The mother wanted to seem shocked , but laughter prevented . " Alfie , you are the limit ! Now tell me , have you really done tomorrow 's homework ? " Of course he had n't . He would need to be reminded and prodded . But he is his mother 's last darling baby and will always be the darling , although his hair is no longer as yellow as canary feathers , a light mustache has begun to smudge his upper lip , and his nose will be bulbous . The twinkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parlor , Papa laid his head on the back of his chair . He did that because he was too tired to talk . Hennie knew . They were two together , she and her father . It had been intended that she would be Henry , but she had turned out to be Henrietta instead . Still , she was tall like him , and she had his strong , separated teeth . That was supposed to be good luck , people said . Papa laughed at that and said he was still waiting . Angelique looked up from her knitting . " Florence and Walter will be  | moving into the house on Seventy-fourth Street before they go to Florida . Such a beautiful house , and right near the park , which is perfect for children . " " You startled him . He was just falling asleep , " Hennie said silently and angrily . She closed her book . " Yes , wonderful , " Papa said . " Wonderful to think that all their good fortune has come to them from the Werners ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shame for a man to feel such bitter humiliation . Hennie could not look at him . " We did n't even have her wedding at our house , " Papa said . It was the hundredth time he had said it . " You know very well , Henry , we could n't have had all those people in this place , " Mama answered . " I do n't know why you keep harping on it . " The South was ruined , yet I married you in your own home , Angelique . " On the wall behind Papa hung his portrait , done by an expensive artist , in Confederate gray . Proud he stood , with epaulets and braid , some sort of thing like a dagger or small sword in his hand , and a jaunty tilt to his head . Whenever he spoke of the South or of ruin , his eyes would go to the portrait . To him it was precious , but to Hennie it gave only a sense of doom , as if it were a reminder , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be lived through by others , maybe by herself . Over and over again , to the end of time . Uncle David had a picture of himself too . His was only a photograph , and his uniform was blue , but he , too , kept it where he could see it . A reminder . To the end of time . " As to the Werners , " Mama said now , " it 's an even exchange and never forget that , Henry ! " She broke off to cast stitches and count , her nervous hands flying . She resumed , " The Werners got rich out of the war that made us poor . They may be in banking now , but the grandfather stood behind a dry goods counter , like all the Germans , not too long ago . Do n't think they are n't very much impressed by the De Rivera name , my dear ! " She was more impressed by it than Papa , who owned the name . How she talked and talked about the distinguished lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before there even was a United States ! What she meant to say is that although among Jews it is infinitely  | better to be German than one of those poor Poles and Russians downtown , it is better yet to be Portuguese or Spanish . This makes me shrivel in my skin . So mean . And stupid , too , because her own mother 's family had been German , as Uncle David liked to remind her . Now Hennie reminded her . " Uncle David was born in Germany . " " Oh , Uncle David ! Why do you always refer everything to Uncle David ! " " I do n't always . " " Well , you are so much like him , " Angelique said , more mildly . And she smiled to make up for the first rebuke , but the second remark was not entirely a compliment either , Hennie knew . They thought it was ridiculous , and even Papa agreed , that Uncle David should practice medicine among the tenements and pushcarts , when he could just as easily be uptown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , although she was fond of him in a way . She made a mystery of his past , but it was no mystery to Hennie because Uncle David had told her about it himself . He had been a secret abolitionist in the South before the war , had shot a man , killing him accidentally , and had had to flee North for his life . He was old , nearly seventy , but you would never guess it . There was joy in his meager rooms , and nobody knew how often Hennie went to him there for his welcome . She got up . " I think I shall go to bed . Papa , Mama , good night . " " So early ? " Papa said . " Do n't you feel well ? " " I feel well , only sleepy . " But mourning had lain thick in the room , like dust . The dust lay on the furniture , the walls , the ceiling , and everything between the walls ; the man with the newspaper dropped by his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they  --  we  --  were all waiting for something . More money , so that they might be what they had been . But what they had been was nothing Hennie wanted . In her own room she could shut the sadness away . The things in it were friends . They spoke to her . The doll with the china head had a winsome face , reminding her of the sunny birthday when Uncle David had brought it , a dozen years ago . Books filled the shelves . Robinson Crusoe , Alice in Wonderland , The Old Curiosity Shop  --  all were friends . Their covers were neat , although they had been read and reread . She liked things to be neat , but spare , without excess . In her jewelry box lay  | a gold bangle bracelet and a seed pearl necklace ; they were her treasures and she craved no more . She lay down in the dark . It was growing cold , with chilly air seeping around the edges of the bed ; the quilt made a warm pocket in which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been so fierce in the afternoon had died away , so that the night was still . The street was quiet except for the occasional clip-clop of a horse and a voice calling good night . Suddenly it was too quiet . It was still early ; there ought to be more life . And she thought of the streets where her settlement house people struggled in dirt and disorder , such as no human being should endure . 1 Ill Yet there was more real life there . Was that nonsense ? She knew she was thought to be too emotional . She could not bear the mew of a starving cat in the areaway , to see horses struggling to pull a bus uphill on ice , while the driver lashed them . Poor things ! Poor things ! she used to cry , when still a child . Too emotional , they said . Well , she was never her mother 's favorite and she had always known that , too , for no gift or smile or kiss can hide a truth like that from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Alfie ! He had " personality , " or rather , many personalities to suit the moment . Mrs. Hughes , the wife of Papa 's partner  --  a hearty fool , in Hennie 's opinion  --  called Alfie a " young gentleman , " which was , of course , her highest praise . She would n't think he was one if she could see him mock her with his sputtering laugh while he tucked two pillows under his coat behind and before . And her mother could be so confidential with Florence ! But Florence had always known how to tie a blue sash on an old white summer dress and turn herself into a beauty , which she was not . When she had been eighteen , like Hennie now , the invitations in their lovely thick envelopes had piled up on the table in the hall . People remembered Florence , people from Sunday school at temple , or people met during a week at the shore . Walter Werner proposed to her two months after they were introduced and married her on her nineteenth birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother . So easily could she vanish under their waves , a little skiff capsized in their wake , if she were to let it happen ! But none of that was any fault of theirs . It was simply that they were determined people and she was not .  | " You only think you are not , " her friend Olga corrected her . " You have never tried to find out . " Their friendship was unexpected  --  or perhaps not unexpected , for Ilennie needed to be wanted and Olga was honored that her teacher sought her out . They had met on the street one summer evening after class ; it had been early , still light , and on sudden impulse Hennie had proposed having a cup of coffee together . Olga had piqued her curiosity . Married to a worker like herself , confined to a drab and bitter life , she had not lost her eager imagination . As fast as Hennie lent books to her , she came back for more . From discussion of Tolstoy and Dickens they came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian persecution , and of the long , hard months of the escape and voyage and the struggle in New York . Hennie told something about her family , and in some fashion , from what Hennie did not say rather than from what she did say , Olga came to understand her position in that family . The imagination that took her to Dickens 's England took her into Hennie 's home . She had never physically entered that home . Clearly felt by both girls , although never put into words , was the unsuitability of such a visit . Their friendship was better left on neutral ground , removed from the tenements to whose resentful occupants Hennie would seem to be a mere sightseer , and removed as well from the polite and curious scrutiny of Angelique . Hennie was wide-awake . She felt suddenly a restless energy . These random thoughts of her friend led now , possibly through a natural association of Olga 's mean street with the one on which that afternoon 's miracle had taken place , back to her own emotion . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wanted to feel like that again . . . . In the gray shadows of the room , his image floated , vague as an unfinished sketch . Yet it was certain that she would recognize him : vivid eyes , a careless dark wave of hair . Absurd fantasy ! What had he to do with her life ? She was a foolish romantic , an embarrassment even to her most secret self . And yet . . . there was so much happening in the world . Meetings , partings , lovers . . . life . Why not to her ? Because . . . absurd fantasy . . . that is why not . Then one day she saw him coming out of Uncle David 's office . He was running down the steps , tossing off his forehead that long , loose wave of  | hair that would not stay in place . He wore the same green corduroy trousers ; it seemed to her very touching , very masculine , not to know better than to wear such an ugly color . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fool you are , Hennie ! A ridiculous fool , she thought , and stood there arguing with herself , trying to decide , encircled by jostling customers in front of a pushcart piled with bananas . A shove brought her to herself . She turned around and went up the stairs . Uncle David had apparently just made a pot of tea . Cup in hand , with feet propped on the ink-spotted desk , he had settled down for an hour of rare solitude . But the smile he gave to Hennie was genuine . " Sit down , pour a cup for yourself . Sorry I 've nothing else to offer , but I forgot to market yesterday . And so how are you ? " " Fine , Uncle David , fine . " " So , tell me what 's going on in the family ! I feel guilty , I 've not seen your parents in more than a month . But I get so busy here , the days rush into each other . " And through the open door , he glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs were lined up on all four sides . His sigh spoke of both weariness and satisfaction , here in his sanctuary , furnished as it was with a baby scale , a shelf of dusty textbooks , a yellowed human skull , medicines , bandages , and splints . " So , tell me , how are they all ? " " The same . My parents still worry about Alfie . He 's not doing well at school and says he wo n't go to college . He wants to make money instead . " " Leave him alone , then . He 's a perfectly sound young man who knows where he wants to go.They 'll never make a scholar out of him , do n't they see that ? " " And Florence is moving . I saw the new house ; it 's lovely , right off Central Park West . " " Ah , yes , the Jewish Fifth Avenue . Well , good . That 's what she wanted . It 's nice to see people get what they want . And you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How does anybody know what he really wants , Uncle ? " " A Jewish reply ! Answering a question with a question . " He set the cup down . " Philosophically , you 're correct . A large question , the aim of life  --  ah , most of us die without ever knowing that ! But I 'm talking  | about the small question , what you do with your life day by day and whether you are satisfied  --  more or less . " It pleased her that he should have so serious an interest in her . Yet , to a certain extent , she saw through his concern , for surely her parents must have talked about her , just as she had heard them talk about Alfie . She began , " Well , you know I am happy with what I am doing . I feel I 'm helping at the settlement ? " " Outside of the settlement , " the old man interrupted . " Oh , I read , I go to the library once a week . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I have been taking out books for Paul . You know what he said to me the other day ? ' I wonder what my ancestors think of me when they look down from heaven . ' Imagine a child of his age having a thought like that ! He 's a beautiful child . I think he 'll be somebody unusual when he 's grown . " The old man did not let her slide into evasions but forced her to answer directly . " Yes , yes , but we were talking about you , not Paul . What about your social life ? " She flushed . " ' Social life ! ' It 's stupid , Uncle David ! People trading invitations . . . " And she mocked , " ' Have you been asked to the soand-so 's ? What ! You have n't ? What a tragedy ! You could have shown off your new fur cape , your ? ' " Again Uncle David interrupted . Interruption was a strange habit for a man who was otherwise so courteous . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it is n't entirely like that , Hennie . Do n't sneer at all of it . It 's not healthy to set yourself so apart . " He spoke very gently . " Be honest , Hennie , you 've retreated from it for some reason that I do n't understand . You make no effort . Is it possible that you do n't feel pretty ? Is that it ? " Your dress is correct , there are no pimples on your face , you are not disfigured ; but you are awkward , your feet are awkward , your tongue is awkward , and you sit with the women when your dances are not taken . " I do n't know exactly , " she murmured . There is something one has or one does n't have . Easy grace . that 's what 's lacking . Easy grace . " You 'll be a fine-looking woman , Hennie .

Do you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall behind Hennie 's head , " do you know , you remind me so much of your grandmother Miriam ? Her qualities seem to have skipped a generation .

" A rush of words , unplanned , came suddenly . " Speaking of bravery , Uncle David , I saw something stupendous a few weeks ago . I saw a man rescue a woman out of a fire . I 'll never forget it . He climbed up on the cornice six floors above the street . It was horrible ! And so wonderful ! You should have seen it , you would not believe a man could do that . It was  --  he was offering his whole life for a stranger . " " Oh , I know who it was . I know him . " 11 " Do you really ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street 11 just a while ago when I came in . " " Daniel Roth ! He was just here . I took care of his hands . " " His whole life , " Hennie repeated with awe . " He 's a very unusual man . " She remembered something . " Daniel Roth . . . I thought I saw that name on the bulletin board at the settlement house . Daniel Roth to play the piano at our children 's Thanksgiving festival . Do you suppose that 's the same one ? " " Oh , yes , he plays piano pretty well and it 's the kind of thing he would do . He 's a teacher . Teaches high school science downtown here . Something of an inventor-scientist , too , keeps a little lab , lives in back of it or upstairs . " Tilting in the chair , Uncle David reached for his pipe . He struck a match , lit the pipe , puffed , took it out of his mouth and examined it with exasperating care while time ticked away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all right ! I 've known him awhile . He 's a fighter , a scrapper . Right now , he 's gotten mixed up with tenement reform . " He paused , reflecting for a minute , unaware of Hennie 's rigid , impatient attention , with her hands clasped around her knees . " Yes , yes , a scrapper . Carrying the fight to the legislature . Works with Lawrence Veiller , an interesting man , an aristocrat born with a strong conscience . Worked in a settlement house , like you . You 've heard of Veiller and read Jacob Riis , I suppose ? " " I 've read How the Other Half Lives . " But she did not want to hear about Riis or Veiller . " Men like them , they looked out " ? here Uncle David waved his hand  | toward the window ? " and hated what they saw . You know , it 's an outrage , Hennie , that they permit these dumbbell tenements , no courtyard , no light or air . But worse than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stairway right in the center , draws the fire up like a rocket ; it shoots through the building , people do n't stand a chance . " So he must have railed against slavery in the South . Youth , fired with indignation , burst for a moment out of the old shell , with its spotty skin and false teeth thick as earthenware plates ; for a moment the eyes sparkled and Hennie , seeing what he had been , felt pity . Still , she wanted to bring the conversation back to Daniel Roth . Uncle David 's tongue was quicker . " Yes , Hennie , yes , and you 've seen the girls standing in doorways waiting for men . Oh , you 're old enough for me to talk about those things , although your parents would be shocked and would n't forgive me . But they 're life , and we must look life in the eye . When a girl is desperate to get out of a rotten hole and there 's no other way , at least no other way she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stood up , bustling . " Let me put these cups away . It wo n't do to have patients come in and see dirty cups . Oh , yes , we were talking about Dan , were n't we ? I suppose it 's not becoming of me to say , but  --  oh , it 's in the family , and you 'll excuse a little boastfulness if I tell you he reminds me of myself ? Except that I was never that good-looking . Of course , he 's not observant ; I doubt that he ever goes to a synagogue , which is regrettable , but still I must n't hold that against him . " He talks too much , it 's a symptom of old age , Hennie thought lovingly as she went out . And she thought , The Thanksgiving festival . I shall be there . The settlement house lay in the center of an irregular quadrangle bounded by Houston Street , the Bowery , Monroe Street and the East River . Five old houses , once the homes of affluent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where cooking , dancing , sewing , debating , carpentry , civics , and the English language were taught . An ample playground had swings and sandboxes . The reception rooms were furnished with donations from the homes of what were called " The uptown ladies " : solid black horsehair sofas , cuspidors and overstuffed chairs , fire screens and glass-fronted bookcases , kept locked to safeguard rows of gold-stamped classics : Plutarch 's Lives and The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . Over the fireplace in the central reception hall  | hung a large mirror framed with gilded plaster nymphs and cherubs holding a cornucopia brimming with grapes . It had been an unwelcome wedding present to Florence and Walter Werner . On this evening , all the lights were on and the building was crowded . The assembly hall had been decorated with Pilgrim symbols , pumpkins and dried speckled corn being part of the process by which the shawled women , the bearded men , and their children from the stetls and the Pale were to be turned into Americans . On the stage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black cardboard hats declaimed with dignity , bowing to Squantum and assorted squaws in striped blankets and chains of beads . Massasoit was a red-haired , ruddy-cheeked twelve-year-old only a year out of Minsk , whom Hennie had brought in less than that year to fluency . The piano was on the far side of the stage from where Hennie sat . The gas lamps were turned down as he came in  --  for she saw that it was Dan Roth . He made a slight bow and struck the keys . He played the simple music with pleasure , looking up now and then to nod encouragement to a faltering child ; he was enjoying himself . Again she heard her own heart beat . And she sat quite still with her hands folded on her dark silk lap , thinking : I shall probably do nothing . The play will end , he will leave , and I will go home . There were speeches . Various ladies , wearing pince-nez on chains , thanked one another for their cooperation . Miss Demarest , the director , expressed appreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially for his assistance with the music . Everyone rose and those who could sang the nondenominational Thanksgiving hymn " We Gather Together to Ask the Lord 's Blessing . " They were invited to the adjoining hall for coffee and cake . It was over . Still Hennie did not move . Someone tapped her on the shoulder . " What is it ? Are you sick ? " asked Olga . The room was empty . " I was only  --  only thinking , " Hennie flushed . Olga was disbelieving and concerned . " But of what , all alone in here ? " " That man who played the piano  --  my uncle knows him , I think . I was wondering how to talk to him , whether I should . " " How to talk ? You open your mouth , you say ' How do you do , I think you 're very good-looking and my name is ? ' "  | Laughter eased the tension in Hennie 's chest . " Olga , you make it so may " " It is easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , just go and do it ! The worst that can happen is that the person wo n't like you and if he does n't seem to , then the devil with him , you 'll try somebody else another time . " So Hennie got up and went inside to Daniel Roth . He was standing among the buxom uptown ladies in their good suits , with gold watches pinned to their lapels , and he looked as if he wanted to get away , just as he had when the reporters besieged him after the fire . " You know my uncle , " she said , " Dr. David Raphael . I 'm Henrietta De Rivera . " " I certainly do ! He 's one of my favorite people . " The smile was warm . " He admires you too . " She did not know that her flush and her timid excitement were becoming . She would have liked to say something gay about the evening , but could think of nothing more , and was confused . The uptown ladies , seeing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The evening was ending . Sleeping infants were awakened and hoisted onto their fathers ' shoulders . Children were fastened into their coats and people were going home . But they were faceless and anonymous to Hennie . They fell away like shadows . She was alone in the room with Daniel Roth , who was looking down at her . He said , astounding her , " Come out and have coffee with me , will you ? It 's early yet . " Such things do not happen . Extravagant fantasies do not come true . In a daze , she took the arm that he offered and they went out onto the street . It was a mild fall night , a rare , brief reprieve of summer , with a milky sky over the rooftops . He led her toward East Broadway . " We can have coffee there , or tea . Do you live near here ? " " No , near Washington Square . " " What brought you down here tonight , then ? " " I work at the settlement . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not especially generous . I have n't any money to give . I just teach English to greenhorns . " " That was n't nice of me . " " What was n't ? "  | " My remark about uptown ladies . It was sarcastic . I 'm sorry . " She had missed the sarcasm . " What else do you do ? " " Sometimes I have a cooking class . Not that I 'm so good , but I like to cook . I like to bake . It 's relaxing . " " You need to relax ? " He sounded amused , so that she thought she was being foolish . " I guess so . Sometimes , " she said lamely . She was beginning to feel uncomfortable with her hand in the crook of his elbow , and made as if to remove it , but he tightened her arm against his side , imprisoning her hand . " You do n't mind taking my arm ? " " Oh , no , I did n't mean ? " Again she fell silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would have turned out differently between them . " Your parents wo n't worry about your being out ? " " No . A group of us usually walk home together , so it 's safe . " " You 'll be safe with me , Henrietta . " " I 'm called Hennie . " " That does suit you better . And I 'm called Dan . " The darkening streets were still astir . A horse plodded back to the stables , pulling an empty wagon . Children spilled raucously over the stoops , and sewing machines whined like tired voices from open groundfloor windows . " Listen , " Dan said . " They 're still working . I do n't know where the strength comes from . Heat , cold , asthma , work and work . " " That 's what Uncle David says . " " Yes , he knows . And cares . That 's why he stays down here . It would surely be easier to move uptown . " " Is that why you teach here too ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was light . Streetlamps glowed across the wide avenue , while lamps in the tall windows of pleasant homes revealed quiet families sitting in parlors , or still at their supper tables . Dan released Hennie 's arm . " In here . It 's a cafe . I 'll bet you 've never been in a cafe before , have you ? " " No . " Nor out with a man , especially one to whom her parents had not introduced her . " We 'll find a quiet table ; it 's early enough . By midnight it will be so  | noisy , you wo n't even hear yourself think , let alone talk , what with the gypsy fiddler and all the Russians arguing . " They sat down . Wooden tables without cloths crowded close . " But it 's clean , " Dan assured her , following her glance . " Or reasonably so . " A waiter brought two glasses of hot tea . " You can have coffee instead . It 's the Russian style to offer tea , and in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'd heard of it . " Her hands felt cold . She curved her palms around the hot glass , aware that he was regarding her with a studied gaze , and wondering what his thoughts were . Perhaps he regretted the impulsive invitation , given only out of politeness because she was Uncle David 's niece . Looking down , she could see his hands resting on the table . She could see the forked vein in the wrist that was turned on its side . It seemed an intimate thing , that small blue vein . Some men came in , speaking volubly in Yiddish . Dan pointed one out . " He 's an actor . He may be a star before long . This is a famous place for the Russian intelligentsia . Journalists , poets , socialists  --  they all come here . The Orthodox have their own places . I go to all of them and belong to none . I like to observe , I 'm curious . " " You 're not Russian , then ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street on Third Avenue . The Bohemian neighborhood , German-speaking . " Her fingers were playing now with a fork . " You keep looking down , " Dan said abruptly . " Why ? Does it frighten you so to be looked at ? " " No . Why do you ask that ? " " Because you blush . Do n't be ashamed . It 's charming . " She looked up . " I ca n't help blushing . I hate it . " Then something loosened inside her . " I saw you when you rescued the woman at the fire . I wanted to go up and tell you how wonderful it was . " " Why did n't you ? " " I suppose I 'm timid . And I saw that you wanted to get away . " " You 're right , I did . They 'd have made a circus out of it , if I 'd let them . Tell me , how old are you , Hennie ? " " Eighteen . " She did not know whether that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be as inexperienced as she must seem .  | " I 'm twenty-four . You seem older than eighteen . You 're very , very serious . " " I guess I am . It 's one of my faults . " " Why , whoever tells you that ? " " Oh  --  people . " He considered . " Well , there 's nothing wrong with that . Living is a serious enough business , God knows . Especially living around here . Did you know they found out later there were three babies left in that building that day ? They found the bodies after the fire had burned itself out . " Hennie shuddered , and he went on , " I get in a rage when I think of people getting rich out of owning such rat holes ! I want to tear them all down or blow them all up ! " He broke off . " Excuse me . I want to change the world . I make myself ridiculous . " She said gently , " You 're not ridiculous at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to myself talking too much . That 's odd , too , because I 'm often criticized for being too silent . But when I get excited about something , then I do n't know when to stop talking . " Florence taught : Always allow a man to talk about himself . Encourage him . Men love that . And feeling ashamed of using such a trick , Hennie said , " I like to hear you . Tell me about yourself . " " There 's nothing much to tell . Anyway , I would n't know how to begin . " " At the beginning . Where you grew up . " He laughed . " Let 's say I was surrounded by cigars . The trash cans on the sidewalks were always full of tobacco leaves . But my father was n't a cigar maker , he was a tailor . My mother was dead . I do n't remember her . " He stopped , as if the sudden memory had halted him . She thought she saw , in the pained contraction of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . He knew a fundamental melancholy . It surprised her that she could so quickly recognize something of herself in a stranger , different as they were , his face so mobile and hers so quiet . " That 's not all , " she said , wanting to recall him from wherever he was . " What else do you want me to tell you ? " " You could tell me what you wanted to be . " " Be ! Well , there was a while there when I had some grandiose ideas about music . When I was a kid , my piano teacher used to praise me , so I began to have a silly vision of myself at a concert grand , you know ,  | ressed in white tie and tails  --  me , in a tailcoat ! Taking bows , with the udience on its feet , going wild . " He frowned . " Anyway , I got over that . Well , I did n't want to be a lawyer  --  all that haggling and arguing  --  and , nlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be a doctor , ither . But I did like science . I did chores in a chemistry lab one summer and that decided me . So I went to City College and now I 'm a science teacher . " He made a small , embarrassed grimace . " I do my little experiments on the side . " " What do you do ? " It was working , Florence was right . A man wanted to talk about himself . " You 've heard of Charles Brush ? " " I 'm afraid I have n't . " " He developed the carbon arc light . I like to study things like that and the power of electrical resonance and . . . oh , many things . . . it 's hard to explain . " " Do n't try . You might as well talk to me in Bulgarian . " He laughed . " Well , it 's just that I admire men who have ideas , men like Edison and Bell  --  you know . I 've got notebooks filled with ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though I did invent something pretty good once . . . . I 'm boring you . " " Of course you 're not ! What was the invention ? " " It was an electric arc lamp that could burn longer than the old ones . " " What happened to it ? " " It 's being manufactured . I got five hundred dollars for it . A friend of mine has a cousin , a lawyer , and he sold it for me . The five hundred came in handy right then , helped make my father 's dying a little more comfortable . " Dan 's jaw tightened . Then he turned to her with an apologetic smile . " I still have crazy dreams that I 'll discover something marvelous , like sending messages around the world by air , or maybe using electrical machines to diagnose disease . Crazy , you know . Who am I , after all ? " " It 's not crazy . You 're only twenty-four . You ca n't tell yet what you 'll do . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can do some good by teaching , I hope . There 's so much intelligence here on these streets , waiting to be unlocked and set free ! It would be easier , though , one could do so much  | more in the school if the life outside were better . That 's where science comes in , science and socialism . " " You 're not a socialist ! " Hennie had never met an actual socialist . " My sentiments are . Not officially . I do n't care about politics , which would shock the political types at these tables . I 'm not with any party . I just like to get out and try to do things that need doing . " " You really do remind me of Uncle David . " " Oh-ho , that 's a real compliment ! I ca n't begin to tell you what I think of him . Honest , simple , good . You know , sometimes I think he has second sight , that man , and can read your mind . Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that you have to say . Rare . " " I think so too . In the family , you know , " Hennie said shyly , " they think he 's awfully odd . You should hear the discussions at our house ! My father and my sister 's husband always vote Republican , you see . They think Uncle David 's a wild-eyed radical , but I do n't find him so . " " Then your family must find you odd , too , and radical ? " " I think they do . They love me , but I think they do . " " Is it lonely for you in your house , then ? I imagine it must be . " " Yes . A little . " They looked candidly at one another . They made solemn appraisal , eye to eye . The contact must have lasted a minute , a long time for eyes to meet without turning away . And Hennie had an extraordinary sense of startling reality , sharp and clear , as if she had just waked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had known until then . Dan pushed his chair back . " Come , " he said , " it 's late , and I do n't want your parents to be furious that I kept you out . " The night had deepened . It was beautiful , with fantastic dark blue clouds in the pale sky , a night to walk and walk and not go home . Here and there , at the street corners , a knot of youths jostled and smoked wherever the light from a candy store fanned out onto the sidewalk . On the top step of a meeting hall an orator was exhorting a small crowd . " Christian mission to the Jews , " Dan remarked . " Let 's stop , it should be interesting . " " No . " Dan was firm . He led her by the elbow . " It can get very nasty . There 's always somebody who 's roused to fury one way or the other . 1 would n't want you to be there . As for me , I never could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolishness , do n't you think so ? " " No . " No " tricks " anymore , nothing but the truth .  | L He asked her curiously , " You 're a believer , then ? " " Yes . . . there has to be something . " She looked up . The clouds ere dispersing , opening the wide sky to a million stars . " All of that , and we down here , ca n't be accidents . Beethoven , or men like your Edison , ca n't be just accidents . " I He was looking down at her now , paying gentle attention to her ; the look on his face , the lovely night , the solemn subject , all filled her . " Are you observant , then , Hennie ? " " Yes , but not like Uncle David . He 's Orthodox . We go to Temple Emanu-El . " " I 've left all that behind me , but if ever I were to be observant , I 'd have to be Orthodox . " They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose , rustling the last leaves from the trees . Dan looked up and down the street . * " I wonder , " he said slowly , " how anyone can believe in Him . Such misery . And the worst of all are the wars . " " Those are not God 's fault , but ours , " she said . " You should talk to Uncle David . You admire him so much . " " I do , I do . Yes , it 's a good thing to be a believer  --  if one can . And it suits you , Hennie . " He turned her face up to the light . " Such a kind face . And lovely eyes , grave eyes . I want to see you again . May I ? " There was such a catch in her throat that she could only nod . " I shall call on your parents . They will expect that . Good night then , Hennie . " She fled upstairs . Tears came to her eyes , the softest , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . " Do you remember when we talked about Dan Roth , Uncle David ? Well , I 've met him . It was two weeks ago when he came to the Thanksgiving festival , and I 've seen him twice since then . We went to the Aquarium and to Central Park last Sunday . " She heard her voice , faster and higher in pitch than usual . The old man 's untidy eyebrows rose . " He came to call on you ? Met your parents ? " " Of course . How else would I get to go walking out with him ? " " Whatever did they talk about ? " " Oh , things . Nothing much , just the usual polite things . "  | But there had been questions , leading questions , and it had all come out , about the tailor father , and the struggle , and teaching school . Ange lique had asked the most questions , so courteous always , with the small smile and the nodding head . And Dan had been the same , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper minuet of nodding heads , so that you would have thought they must be despising each other , and yet neither , afterward. had said anything except " He 's an intelligent young man " and " Your parents are gracious people . " " He has invited me to the opera . I do n't think Mama wants me to go , but she ca n't very well refuse , since he invited me in her presence . " Uncle David took the pipe out of his mouth . " What you 're telling me is that your parents  --  your mother-did n't like him . " " Of course they would prefer someone like Walter . " It was what they had not said after Dan had left , the words they had not used that mattered : family background , meaning , at bottom , money . Money for things to handle and hold , as when Angelique moves the candelabra after dinner or fingers her pearls . " They do make quite a contrast , do n't they , Daniel Roth and my brother-in-law ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , after all , nothing that wrong about Walter Werner . " " I did n't mean that there was , but I do prefer Dan 's sort of man . " " Oh , I agree . Yet things  --  people  --  are not all that simple . " The remark was trite , a statement of the obvious . Still , there was a strange ring to it . They went to hear Rigoletto . Florence and Walter , undoubtedly at Angelique 's instigation , went with them . Walter had insisted on providing the four seats in the fifth row at the center . " I sit in the top balcony , when I do n't stand , " Dan remarked . Above them , the Diamond Horseshoe glittered and spangled ; there was much back-and-forth motion up there , visits among the boxes , late arrivals and second-act departures . " That 's Mrs. Astor , " Florence said , offering her opera glasses to view a large , bejeweled lady . Dan whispered , " Now I know where the expression ' Astor 's pet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful that he had whispered . The remark  | would have been a dreadful affront to Florence , for whom the Mrs. Axtors of the world were objects of veneration . Later , Walter took them all to supper at Delmonico 's . Although Henair had at first refused to borrow her sister 's evening cloak , she was now relieved that her mother had made her accept it , for the room was a lower garden of satins and velvets , and of white shoulders belonging to women so exquisite , it was hard not to stare . Hennie had been there only twice before . " Well , what do you think of it ? " Walter asked . He had a paternal manner toward Hennie . His eyes , magnified by his glasses , were penetrating . Disliking him , she blurted , " I 'm not sure what I think , Walter . It s n't seem quite real to me . " And he had laughed , with that cool , not unfriendly laugh , the head tilted , considering her as though she had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she persist ? ? " Oh , it 's beautiful , but it 's like a play , do you see what I mean , as if everyone were acting a part . A lay or a ceremony . " " Now that , " Florence said , irked , but certainly not as sharp-toned as she would have been if Dan , the outsider , had not been there , " that is really nonsense , Hennie . " Dan came to Hennie 's defense . " I understand exactly what Hennie means by ' unreal . ' Yes , I do . " And he looked around . The lofty space was filled with animation : laughter , swirling dresses , popping champagne corks , scurrying waiters , lavish furs draped on the backs of chairs . He continued slowly , " There 's a sense of true value , of truth worth , among the workers . There 's so much waste here , more food than can be eaten , more and too much of everything . I have been determined all my life never to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 's no end to what you will find necessary , even when you do n't deserve it . " His head went up as he said it . There was not a man in the room to compare with him . Hennie had not failed to notice the women who had glanced at Dan when he walked in , their glances lingering an extra fraction of a second . People looked at him , not at her . And for an instant something cold fell in her chest , a weight , cold and heavy , so that she had to force herself to raise it . " You must remember , " Walter admonished , " that these people worked for what they have , or their parents or grandparents did . And they do provide employment . They keep the country moving . "  | Dan was stubborn . " Spending on armaments , that 's what really keep , the country moving , as you put it . " " You do n't think we should be armed ? " asked Walter . And Hennie thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ w talking like this ? " We are spending like madmen , " Dan said . " Still , there are hopeful signs . " He went on , " That a blind despot like the Czar should call for . t limitation of armaments is hopeful . " The dialogue was a ball , thrown and immediately returned . Walter replied , " I would n't place too much hope in that . I do n't truss them in Europe , any of them . " " Without some trust in the good intentions of one 's fellow man there can be no future . " " If we are all to disarm , just as we are , that must mean everyone i satisfied with things as they are . Do you suppose France is content to let Germany keep Alsace-Lorraine ? In my opinion , Germany has no right to it . " When Dan raised his eyebrows , Walter laughed , a slight superior laugh . " Do I surprise you ? You must be thinking that because my parents are German-born , I am a Germanophile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another generation . " " German , French , or whatnot , it makes no difference . They are all murdering thieves . " Dan 's voice , although low , resounded . People at the adjacent table looked , and looked away . And Dan continued . " Yes , the common man is taxed to pay for their monstrous weapons . advanced models , year after year , with money that could be used for electrification , clean power , to take the load off the human back . I myself , in my small way , have been working on ? " He stopped . " I 'm sorry . This is n't the time or place . " But Walter insisted , " You have to have weapons . " His neat mouth firmed . " It 's naive to think otherwise . Would you put your life 's savings on the table and leave the front door open ? " " You have to make a beginning , " Dan responded . Now Florence intervened . " Mr. Roth is right , Walter . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've come to enjoy ourselves . " " Call me Dan . And scold me . I began it . " " I will call you Dan , but I will not scold you . " Florence smiled  | ingly . " I think you have a very interesting point of view , and I 'd to hear more sometime . But right now , I do n't mind telling you , I 'm ed . Shall we order ? " Let us have no rough edges . Smooth . Smooth . She was right to do that , Hennie knew . But Dan was right too . Water and oil do n't mix . They would never like each other , any of than . the winter blossomed . The ice-cold sky reflected its pure blue in the , now meadows of Central Park , and the tinkling bells of jolly sleighs Wunded in the streets , while snow sprayed under the runners . At the St. Nicholas Rink , Hennie , in new striped woolen stockings , whirled with a couple together , striding and sliding in rhythm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man on the ! reezing corner , who sold a flower for Hennie 's lapel , handed it over as if At were a gift . At the settlement , her most rowdy , unmanageable children Were really only normal rascals , after all . People were so friendly , so food . One could love everyone . " It shows on your face , " Olga said one evening , after an English class . " What shows ? " Hennie pretended not to understand , but she knew quite well ; she had told Olga , having had to tell someone , and this girl ? With the poor thin , white-faced young husband bent all day over a sewbig machine  --  knew about love . At night , Hennie sat at her window and dreamed . She had such longing for him , for his thick hair , shining as animal fur , for his sad mouth , his rounded eyelids , his beautiful hands . Such longing . " It 's been a long time since you were here , " Uncle David said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem casual . " I 've been seeing your friend Daniel Roth . " " Oh ? Where do you go together ? " " Walking . Skating . We went to the opera with Florence and Walter . Heard Rigoletto . It was marvelous . " " Ah , yes . . . and how did it work out ? " Uncle David had a way of fixing you with his gaze , demanding an honest answer . So , dropping the careless manner , she replied , " Walter Insisted on buying the seats and Dan did n't like that very much . " " I should imagine not . He 's independent , if he 's anything at all . "  | Uncle David paused , looking thoughtful . In a moment he would fum ble with the pipe , preparing what he had to say . He struck a match and blew it out . " Yes , yes , it 's a strange business , this man-woman thing . Making a choice , I mean . How does one ever know ? And one 's whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match , lit the pipe , puffed , and removed the pipe . " Maybe that 's why I never married . My sister , your grandmother . how much do you remember of her , Hennie ? " You never knew what unexpected direction a conversation with Uncle David might take . He could be exasperating . " Not much . She used to sing a German song when I was very little . ' Du Bist wie eine Blume . ' " " ' You Are Like a Flower . ' She remembered that from her own childhood . Yes , a remarkable woman . She had tremendous courage , as I always tell you . " And I do n't need to hear it again , Hennie thought . " Maybe you did n't know she had made the wrong marriage . She lived in misery with your grandfather for years . " " I did n't know . " " Well , I do n't suppose there 's much use in resurrecting these things It 's just that sometimes one remembers , and it can be painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold , glittering afternoon , and he was talking about people long dead . His tone was rueful , which she did not want , because it did not match the energy within her . The old man began to clean his pen on a rag . His forehead was thoughtful ; his hands went round and round . After a minute or two he remarked , " I suppose you find him very handsome ? " She was startled . " Who ? " " Why , Roth of course , who else ? You did n't think I meant Walter Werner , did you ? " " Well , you were talking about my grandfather . " She laughed , then answered lightly , " Oh , yes , do n't you think so too ? " " I do . And so does every woman who comes in sight of him , Hennie . " " What can you mean ? " " What I say . All the women run after him . I 've known him a while , you see , and I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face prickled with the sudden  | eat of an intense blush . " Do you really think I would run after anyone , Uncle David ? " " No , you 're not bold enough , my dear . " Not bold . But tenacious , Papa says . You never give up , in your quiet way . " Other women are bold enough , though , Hennie . And that 's the trouble . " " I do n't know what you 're trying to tell me , Uncle David . " Something hardened in her . Fear or anger , or both . " He has too much charm for his own good . Some people are born like that . It 's as if they had a magnet in them . " The glitter of light beyond the window hurt her eyes . She moved the chair . " I do n't see what difference all that makes , " she said . Do n't you ? Do n't you ? " What if other women look at him ? He ca n't help that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the pipe . He does that because he has to think of an answer . And she waited . " You see how it is , Hennie . There are men who ca n't resist . They ca n't be faithful to one woman . Yes , they love their wives , but still they ca n't resist . " " And you think . . . " Her voice was queer , falsetto . " You think Dan is like that ? " " Yes , I do . Do n't go falling in love with him , Hennie . Please do n't . " She was silent , stricken , disbelieving . " Are you in love with him , Hennie ? " She was still silent . " He wo n't do for you . I must tell you . Listen to me , Hennie , my dear . He loves women too much . That 's his failing . " " After all the fine things you said about him ! " " Yes , and they were all true . But what I 'm telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me ! Why just now ? " " I never thought before that it would he necessary . " She despised him , sitting there with his pipe and his pen and his skeleton on the shelf . He was old , and old people hated the young when they looked at them and realized what they had missed , what it was now too late for them to have . . . . " I see that you 're angry at me. "  | " I am . You have no right . You 're spoiling . . . spoiling , " she stammered . " I do n't want you to be hurt , that 's all , " Uncle David said gently . " I wo n't be hurt . Or is there something else you 're not telling me ? " That Dan had committed some crime . . . no , no , impossible . " There 's nothing more , I swear , but what I 've said . Believe me , Hennie , I 'm telling you something your mother would n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I know that an unfaithful husband would break your heart . There are many women who can live with that , but I do n't think you could . " The old man gave her a smile , which she did not return . " Let me not make too much of this , though . A man comes to call a few times . . . that does n't mean you 'll be married . I only wanted to warn you . No harm done , I hope . " She would not look at him . How dare he ? A man was falling in love with her , she was certain of it . She drew herself up , smoothing her skirt ; the womanly gesture reassured her . Old man , old man , what do you know ? Oh , the damp first air of spring , the damp soft air ! The Italian organ grinder played " Santa Lucia " with passionate longing , grinding it out from one street into the next . Girls played hopscotch and boys shot marbles on the sidewalks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Central Park . They walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and watched the sailing ships come up the river . " Imagine ! Around the Horn from China ! " Hennie cried . Dark yellow men on the deck , men in miniature from where they stood far above in the wind on the bridge , were hauling rope . She turned to face Dan . " What does it make you think of ? Tea ? Silk ? Red lacquer ? " He bent down to her . Tall as he was , he always had to lean down . " Of you . I can see myself in your eyes . Did you know they 've got green in them ? " " Dan ! They 're brown . " Staring back into his eyes , she could see herself reflected . She was easy with him now ; it seemed impossible that she could ever have been wary . He had done that for her . " But there 's green all the same , " he insisted . " Not like any other eyes I 've ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever known , either . " She countered cheerfully . " How many have you known ? "  | Banter , light and happy , while the heart pounds . " Oh , dozens . Hundreds , maybe . No , seriously , Hennie , you 're differ " from all of them . I 'm in love with you . You know that , do n't you ? " She wanted to prolong the marvel of suspense . " You hardly know " Four months , almost . That 's long enough . Anyway , I know my own incl . The question is , do you ? " " Do I ? " " Know your own mind ? Love me ? " The wind almost bore her faint voice away . " I love you . " " Darling Hennie . " His lips moved on her cheek . " We 'll have good ears together , a good life . Darling Hennie . " How wrong you were , Uncle David . " You are seeing so much of Daniel Roth , " Angelique remarked one y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are always seven or eight of us gether when we go skating or riding . Friends of his , other teachers . " he elaborated . " They 're a sort of club  --  for cycling  --  and sports . " Her mother looked at her doubtfully . " Well , of course , I know you would n't go about with any young man unchaperoned . " Dan was not used to chaperonage . Among East Side intellectuals , teachers , and writers , that sort of thing was ridiculed . So it became necessary for her to lie at home . Oh , if they knew what was going on ! She thought of that rent-strike meeting at which he had spoken with such passionate and righteous conviction , a hero on the platform . Standing there in the crowd , looking up at him , she 'd had a flash , an incongruous picture of her parents and herself at the dinner table in Florence 's house : the timid maid passing the platters , Walter 's pink-shaven cheeks above the stiff collar , an array @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known her people in the classroom , but had had to imagine where they lived . Now she saw . " The rent for those foul holes is twelve dollars a month , " Dan told her . " Sure , they get a lodger who pays sixty-five cents a week , but bread is fifteen cents a day at least , milk four cents a quart , a pound of meat twelve cents . No wonder they eat so many pickles . They 're cheap and they fill you up . "  | She came to know every miserable street . Her sharpened vision picked out details that had once been only a blur . Listening to Dan , she felt a new rise of surging , painful indignation . Strange that she had perhaps heard the same words often enough in the mouth of Uncle David , but never with this immediacy . I ' I " It 's like Zola , " she observed . " You 've read Zola ? That 's pretty daring for a girl your age . " He spoke with admiration . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the clotheslines overhead ; a hawker offered a worn coat for fifty cents ; on a plank laid across two ash barrels , piles of fish lay rotting in the sun , as spring warmed into summer . Here no organ-grinders played , for there was no one to throw pennies to them . " Look , " Dan said , " at that boy reading there on the stoop . There 's no III place inside for him to do his schoolwork . Frustrating . I am frustrated as a teacher . " Riding the Second Avenue elevated , they could see into the secondfloor rooms where the " sweaters " worked . " Like animals in stalls , " Dan said . " Tubercular old men , and children who soon will be , cooped up together . See the belt on your dress ? " Hennie looked down at the narrow belt . " It came from a place like that . Somebody working ten or twelve hours a day for five dollars a week or less made it . " ; " I know . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was wrong ! Wrong ! And Mama complains that it 's not easy to be poor , as if she had any idea what being poor is . Between Grand Street and East Broadway lay a scrap of park , gray cement between the gray tenements , with some benches under a scrawny tree that drooped in the heat of fading summer . They sat for a while without speaking . Dan looked off into the distance . She wondered what he could be seeing in that arid place . " I 'm proud of you , Dan , " she said , suddenly very moved . " Proud ? What have I done ? I 've done nothing yet . " He took her hand . The warmth of their two hands sent soft waves sweeping through her body . She felt the warmth of her own hair on her it neck , was aware of her breasts , and thought of their bodies entwined . " We 've known each other almost a year , " she said . " It seems longer . " The sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's late . We ca n't just keep sitting here , " he said , almost angrily .  | " Why not ? It 's peaceful . " " Because . Your parents will be asking questions . " " I do n't care . " " You do n't mean that . There 's no sense looking for trouble . " They walked slowly , lingering . The streets were emptying , children were called in , horses clumped back to the stables . Hennie pointed . " That 's your street , is n't it ? " " Yes . " After a moment , Dan said , " I 'd ask you in . . . but I have the lab in back of a machine shop , and a room upstairs . . . it 's a mess . " She was silent . " The room is , I mean . The lab I keep spick-and-span . Could n't work otherwise . " Her heart was heavy and despondent , with all the warm glow cooled . Yet she had to say something ; what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've never really understood what you do in the lab . " " Oh , one thing and another , as the ideas come . " " I do n't even know what electricity is ! " " Do n't let that worry you . Nobody knows what it is . We can use it , make transformers and generators , do things with it , but what it is . . . " He shrugged . " If you 're religious , you can say God made it . Otherwise , you can just say it 's some sort of energy rushing around the universe , and let it go at that . " She thought : As if I really care about electricity or whether God made it or anything except  --  what I care about . They arrived at her house . He stood looking at her . " I wish we could go home together , " he said . " I 'm so sick of always leaving you here . Kissing you quickly before anyone sees , walking home alone . It 's such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room together with a closed door . " She wanted to ask : " Yes , when ? " But she kept still . Her eyes filled with quick tears . " It 's only money . I 'm afraid of the future , of having nothing for you . Every damned thing is money , " he said bitterly . " Even love costs money in this damned world . " She wanted to shut his words out . Like a key , they opened a door onto a gloomy space into which she did not want to look . " We 'll find a way , " she said . " I 'm sure we will . "  | Alfie came into her room . Thirteen now , he was becoming a person , a Mensch , as the Germans said . Sometimes , especially when their parents were out of the house , he would wander into her room and lie on the floor on his stomach , doing homework while she read . He could say surprising things , too , showing a power of observation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Mama and Pa talking about you last Sunday , " he informed her . Brushing her hair , she could see him in the mirror . He had given himself an expression of importance . " Mama wants Pa to speak up to you . " " Speak up ? About what ? " She turned quickly , knowing . " You know what . About Dan . " " Mr. Roth , you mean . You 're not grown up enough to call him Dan . " Why did she chastise the boy ? You kill the messenger who brings the bad news , that 's why . " Aw , " he said , " I can call him Dan if I want to . Do n't you want to hear what they said ? Then I wo n't tell you . " " I 'm sorry , Alfie . Tell me , please . " Mollified , he explained , " Well , Pa said , ' No , that 's a foolish tactic . Let the thing wear itself out , ' or something like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anybody can see it . ' And he said , Nothing will probably come of it anyway . ' And Mama said , ' Yes , but it 's been a year , he 's wasting her time . ' " " Anything else ? " H " Yes . Mama said you really have been looking so much prettier lately . And she said that Florence could introduce you to lots of people , but you always say no . Do you ? " H " I suppose I do . " She felt a weakness , an inner trembling . Soon they would really begin to press her for an explanation . Alfie 's humorous eyes crinkled with curiosity . " Because you 're in love , that 's why . You let him kiss you , I 'll bet . " And he gave hissputtering laugh . He is thinking about what comes after kissing , just as I do . " Alfie ! Do n't be fresh . " " I do n't care if you kiss him , you know . I like him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't mind being in his class , you know ? "  | " He is very smart . He invented something , some kind of light , or tube something that burns longer than they ever did before . " F " Really ? He must be rich , then . " " Oh , no , he got almost nothing for it . " " Then he was cheated . He should n't have sold outright . An income is hat you want . " " Alfie , I do n't mean to insult you , but you do n't know anything about siness . You 're only thirteen . " " A ten-year-old would know better than that ! " " Well , anyway , Dan does n't do these things for money . He does them ? r the pleasure , for curiosity about the way the world works . He 's a true ientist . " " You going to marry him , Hennie ? " She had a need to talk about what had filled her all these months with uch joy and such expectancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can I trust you ? I 've not told anyone . " He was pleased . " Not Florence ? " " No . Only you . Because I know you wo n't tell till I 'm ready . " " I wo n't tell . Are you going to marry him , then ? " " Yes , " she said softly . " When ? " " I do n't know . . . soon . " There was deep loneliness in the room after Alfie went out , a sadness deeper than the melancholy of separation , because tonight for the first time it was tinged with fear . She tried to comfort herself with sleep , but sleep only brought a terrifying dream . Dan was standing beside her in some place with a vaulted ceiling , full of crashing music and echoes ; he was opening his lips , saying something she could not hear ; he had to repeat it over and over before she understood . " I will never marry you , Hennie , " he was saying , while behind his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book away . It was no use trying to concentrate . Her eyes . looking into the farthest distance , came to rest on the fringe of springgreen leafage that screened the stone gleam of the mansions on Fifth Avenue , across the park . The weather was fine and fresh ; a spirited breeze rippled through the shrubbery ; everything was new and restless and beautiful , making you want everything . She had a feeling of panic : This was all being wasted . Days like this were slipping by , and she was doing nothing with them . People passed . An old man and his wife walked arm in arm , with their homely faces turned to the sun . Big dirty boys jostled and shoved , on the way home from school ; raucous and laughing , one doubled over , holding his stomach . On the opposite bench sat a young woman ; it was plain , in spite of her concealing , modest coat , that she was expecting a baby . She 's not much older than I am , Hennie thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see of her face when she looks up from the magazine , she 's no beauty . Yet someone wanted her enough to spend the rest of his life with her , and now there would be a child . . . . A dreamy smile touched the  | young woman 's mouth . She was thinking of the child . No , she was thinking of the man who had given her the child . . . . A life made out of two . Of Dan and me . Hennie was shaken . Longing and terror that it might never be  --  these shook her . And in her mind 's eye , closing her seeing eyes , she saw Dan 's dark head ; saw , too , a babY 's head , damp and fuzzy ; she felt the baby , warm , curved , curling on her shoulder . . . " I 'm back , Aunt Hennie ! " She opened her eyes . Paul sat on his little bicycle with the pride of a conqueror . " Well , you had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go home . You know . Time for your piano lesson . " " I do n't want to play piano , " Paul protested . " Ah , but it will be fun to know how when you grow up , " she said . " I have a friend who plays just beautifully . " " I know ! It 's Dan ! " " Dan ? You must call him Mr. Roth . " " He said I could call him Dan . " " When did he say that ? " " The time we met him here in the park , near the lake , and he took me rowing . " That had been one Sunday afternoon last year . Now the second year was well along . " Where does Dan live ? " " Oh , far from here . Downtown . " " Let 's go to his house . " " But I told you we have to go home . " " Then take me to his house next time . " " Well . . . we ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everybody has a house ! " Paul cried scornfully . " No , everybody has n't . Not big enough for company , I mean ? " " Oh , you mean like Grandma 's house , where you live ? All flat , with no stairs ? " " Much smaller than that . " " I like Grandma 's elevator , except the ride 's not long enough . I 'd like to be an elevator man when I grow up ; then I could ride up and down as much as I wanted . " " Oh , yes , that would be lovely ! " At the corner of the street they could see halfway down the block ;  | trunks were being carried up from the areaway of the Werners ' house and loaded onto a wagon . " Look , Paul , there go your things on the way to the mountains ! Are n't you excited ? " " Yes , and we 're taking the canary and the cook 's cat , too , this year , Mother promised . They can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way we do . " Florence was at the front door as the wagon departed . " What a mess it is going away , " she sighed . " Such a rush ! All this furniture to be covered and the windows boarded up for the summer . And the seamstress is still upstairs working on my summer dresses , with only two more weeks to go . I do n't know what I 'll do if she does n't finish them . Well , come in , sit down , you must be exhausted . " " No , we had a nice time , Paul and I. It 's a lovely day . " The hall was somber . The stained-glass window next to the door turned the outdoor light to a dreary mauve , spilling it over the golden oak woodwork and the fleur-de-lis wallpaper . In the parlor , more stained glass in an enormous chandelier laid another gloom , wine-colored this time , over the sepia photographs of Michelangelo 's Moses and Rembrandt 's Night Watch . In front of the sofa , the tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul said immediately . " It 's time for your piano lesson in fifteen minutes , " Florence objected . " Go up and wash your hands , dear . You may have cake after supper . " " I 'm afraid I promised him some on the way home , " Hennie said meekly . " Oh dear , you 'll spoil the child . Well , all right , then , take a chocolate cookie , it wo n't make so many crumbs , and go upstairs and ask Mary or Sheila to wash your hands . That 's a good boy . " Yes , you will spoil him , " Florence repeated when he had left the room . " I do n't mean to . It would be hard to spoil ' Paul anyway . He 's far too intelligent for that . " Florence looked at her . " You should have a dozen children , you 're the type " Hennie gave the expected modest smile . A sudden physical weakness hit her , so that her hand , accepting the teacup , trembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its " Oriental nook " under the striped canopy , was stifling . She felt like crying and fought the first gathering of  | tears by straining her eyes toward the hall , toward the stuffed peacock on the newel post . It was fortunate that the room was so dark . " You really should come to the Adirondack place with us , Hennie . With Alfie going , it will be so nice . Why do n't you ? " Florence 's hand fondled the arm of a new chair ; it had mother-of-pearl inlay ; it must feel slick and expensive . " It 's awfully far " was all Hennie could think to answer . " Nonsense ! What difference does that make ? You 'll sleep on the train and in the morning , there you 'll be at the lake . You ca n't believe how beautiful it is , wild and beautiful . At night the loons call , and everything smells of pine , even your blankets . You 'd love all that . " Why is she so insistent ? Why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do know why . And she knows I know . " Walter 's parents are so hospitable , they 'll make you at home right away . But you 've been at their place in Elberon , so you know how they are . Except this is so much nicer , even though I admit Elberon is convenient , with Walter commuting to work by ferry ; only , this summer they want us to spend a month with them in the mountains . They 're really so good to us . I 'm lucky to have in-laws like them . I pray you 'll be as lucky , Hennie . " Yes , Hennie thought , I believe she does pray for me . Security and satisfaction had softened Florence . The nervous impatience that Hennie remembered had come , very likely , from anxiety about her future ; it had vanished entirely in the years of her marriage . " Do come , Hennie ! " Florence looked kindly at her sister . " If you do n't , you 'll only have to argue your way out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama . Two weeks in a rocking chair on a veranda . How I always hated it ! Those huge , shingled piles with turrets and miles of corridors and old people doing nothing all day but sitting and eating and then sitting some more . " Hennie collected herself . " I 'm so busy at the settlement right now , you see . I 've started a cooking class , did I tell you ? And I hate to just abandon it in the middle . " Florence jumped up and went to the little desk between the front windows . " That reminds me , I almost forgot ! Walter left a check for the settlement , for you to give in your name . " " Oh , thank him for me . No , I will write to him myself ! " Hennie cried ,  | and felt ashamed of her mental image of Walter , that stick , with his bowler hat and spats . " It 's so generous of him ! Five hundred dollars ! " " Walter is generous , " Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though Mama still likes to look down on them . But the Germans have a conscience , they know what anti-Semitism is . People like the De Riveras have been in America so long  --  Sons of the American Revolution , the Knickerbocker Club and all  --  that they 've forgotten . Of course , " she continued with high amusement , " now that the Germans have gotten rich , they are socially acceptable . " Hennie folded the check into a neat square and put it in her purse , repeating , " It 's so good of Walter . " " Well , he admires your work . Bringing these people into American life , making them Americans of Jewish faith . The sooner they lose their foreign ways , the better for them and for us all , Walter believes . " Florence was complacent . What are we doing ? Two sisters talking generalities , concealing what is really on our minds . Florence poured another cup of tea and stirred it . Round and round went the pretty spoon . After a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Lucille Marks is being married . Is n't she the Marks girl you went to school with ? " " No . Her sister , Annie . " " Somebody named Dreyfuss . A graduate of Harvard Law . I wonder if that 's the Boston Dreyfuss my friend Hilda knows ? I must ask . " Florence had almost total recall of the social columns . Now she paused , studied the teaspoon , and finally , having made a decision , looked up frankly at her sister . " You wo n't go away because of Daniel . " Hennie , forcing herself to meet Florence 's gaze , was surprised to see , not the challenge she had expected , but a rather soft concern . " I guess so , " she said , beguiled into admission . " What 's happening , Hennie ? I do n't want to pry , honestly I do n't . But I 've had a hard time keeping Mama from exploding . She does n't understand what 's going on . " " ' Going on ! ' Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ? " " Almost two , dear . " " Do they want marriage on sight ? "  | " Hennie  --  they do n't want you to marry him at all . That 's what they 're worried about . You must see that . " " Then what do they want ? Him to propose and me to refuse him ? " " They suspect you 're seeing more of him secretly than you admit to , but they ca n't prove it , and that 's why they have n't really raised the roof . " " I do n't see him all that much . I do run into him at the settlement . There 's nothing wrong with that , is there ? He 's been giving free piano lessons to a few of my children . " " Very commendable of him . " Florence added quietly , " You have also been meeting him in Central Park , have n't you ? Paul said something . And Walter saw you once on his way home from his parents ' house . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet a couple of times in the park ? One would think he had planned to  --  to attack me there . " " Hennie ! What an awful thing to say ! You shock me ! But just listen to me and do n't be angry . I 'm only trying to help you . " " You do n't like him , either . Do n't deny it . It wo n't be any use , because I know you do n't . " " I 've been as nice to him as anyone could be , the few times I 've been with him , and so has Walter . You ca n't say we have n't been . " " Yes , but he 's not your style . " Florence did not reply at once . Then , laying her hand on her sister 's arm , she spoke with a married woman 's dignity and the authority of experience . " Hennie , I see you do n't want to talk about it , so I 'll say no more , except that you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best years . A girl has n't got all the time in the world , and that 's all I have to say . . . will you stay to dinner ? " Hennie stood up . " I 'm not dressed up enough for your house , " she said , hearing the petulance in her own voice . " Paul got chocolate on my skirt just now . " The sarcasm did not escape Florence . " We are not Buckingham Palace here , after all , " she said reproachfully . " And there is no one coming to dinner , except a young man from the office to go over some lastminute business with Walter . A rather nice young man , too , come to think of it . You might do well to stay . I 'll lend you a dress if you want to change . " But Hennie had to go . Something was jumping alive in her chest . Something had to be done . She could n't stay waiting this way any  | longer , waiting for something to happen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's the light from the stained glass , " she said to herself . " No , it 's not , I look awful ; I look weary , worried and furrowed . " She pinned her hat on . " Think about the mountains , anyway , " Florence said . Her face in the glass was younger than Hennie 's , smooth , troubled only because of Hennie and for no reason of her own . " If you change your mind , let me know . " Hennie rode the omnibus , clattering over the cobbles down Fifth Avenue . Past the Vanderbilt mansion and the imitation chateaux , the gray granite and white marble , and past the Croton Reservoir on 42nd Street , they rattled and swayed . Block after block of tidy brownstones stood behind their neat squares of lawn and iron fences . She glanced at her watch . In each neat parlor , no doubt , the tea service was now being cleared away . All was orderly . Oh , there was much to be said for order ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected of him , for the place that is there today and will be there tomorrow . The table and the child . Yes , and upstairs the room with the door that can be shut and locked , and in the center of the room the bed in which one never has to lie alone . Why , why so long to wait ? Meeting always in public places , in parks and restaurants , walking , walking until it became too dark , too cold , or too late to stay any longer . And a thought made her hand fly involuntarily to her lips : Was he perhaps , after all , the kind of man who would n't marry ? Things Uncle David had said . . . Not possible ! And the thought terrified her , as would a robber confronted in an alley ; like a robber , it robbed and fled . The horses pulled to a stop at Washington Square . Among the last remaining passengers , she stepped out into the fading afternoon . For a moment or two she stood beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if in the palms of her hands . She looked east toward home . She ought to go home . But there was a need to know . . . . At last she made up her mind , and walked away with quick , decisive steps . She has not meant it to happen this way . But then , neither had he . She has only meant to ask him what is to become of them and whether he really means to stay with her , because he has been so vague about it and this panic has taken hold of her . That 's all she has meant .  | But they come together . That which , in ignorance and desire , she has so long imagined , now happens . He opens the door and is astonished to see her . Suddenly she is appalled at her own boldness , but it is too late to turn back . He has been working ; there is a light under some sort of burner in the room behind him . " I 'm disturbing you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just finishing . I was going upstairs . " He turns off the burner . They stand there looking at each other . Then , " Will you come up ? " he asks . He opens the door at the top of the stairs and stands aside to let her go in . This is where he lives . . His bed is the first thing she sees there , his naked bed . She looks away . But the room is too small to avoid it . Between the bed and the bulk of an ugly upright piano , there is just enough space to pass . There is a pile of clothing on a chair . When he removes it , there is a pile of books beneath it . He stands there holding the clothes and the books , looking for a place to put them all down . Since there is no place , he puts them back on the chair . He apologizes for the mess , and they both sit down on the edge of the bed . They do n't say a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of the street rushes in : wagons rattle , a door is slammed , a child wails , two angry men threaten one another . And yet the street is remote . They are insulated from it behind the walls . The room is an island . He kisses her . The kiss is different from past kisses , softer , and also harder , because they are alone , no one is watching , and there is plenty of time . She does not want it to end . His hands quiver on the buttons that go all the way down her back . There is no question now about what is to happen . Often she has thought that she would be afraid , and has a flash of surprise at herself because she is not . Instead , it is all simple and clear , all decided . She will let him do whatever he will with her ; she will wait for whatever happens . Piece by piece , he takes off her clothes . She is warm , warm and weak , but she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . She ca n't stop , she ca n't wait . The last thing she hears is the sounds of the organ-grinder , the opening bars of some banal , familiar tune that fades as quickly as it began , along with all the noises and voices in the world ; everything fades , even the afternoon light ; the circle draws in , shrinks to a single point where they lie .  | He brought a woolen robe to cover her . It was almost dark , a blue dusk , with a great peace in the room . It was entirely natural to be there . " You 're so beautiful , " he said . " Your perfect neck and shoulders . One would never guess . Your clothes hide you . You ought to wear lower necks and brighter colors . Why do n't you ? " " My mother always says I do n't look well in bright colors . " " Your mother 's wrong . I wonder why she does that to you . Maybe she does n't even know why , herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't try to hide it . I understand . " " I could like your father . But even he , I 'm sure , thinks you could do better than me . " She had a vision of long years ahead that could be turbulent and should be tranquil . And she tried to explain . " It is n't only snobbishness , although there 's too much of that . But they 've been crushed down . The war did it to them . " " Tell me about it . You never have . " " They were ruined . My grandfather was killed , fallen from a balcony during a soldiers ' raid . My mother knelt on the grass all night beside him while he died . She was only a girl . " She felt a sudden wave of love and pity for her mother . And she went on , " Some day I 'll tell more . How the lovely house was sold . It did n't bring nearly what it was worth , Papa says , but they had to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he 'd been wanting to go North anyway . " " Dear Hennie , I 'm so glad he did ! " She thought of something . " Is n't it amazing that you and Uncle David knew each other ? If you had n't , I could never have gone up to speak to you . " " What a grand man he is ! I hope he thinks half as much of me as I do of him . " " He told me wonderful things about you , " she answered . Someday , maybe , she 'd tell him what else Uncle David said , and they 'd laugh about it together . Old people , they 'd say . . . . She went behind the door to get dressed . Strange that the removal of her clothes had been so natural , while their replacement was embarrass-ing ! " Hennie , there 's something I want to tell you , " she heard him say . He will tell me when we shall be married .  | " I only want to promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful . You wo n't become pregnant . " Why , all at once , this trembling shame ? Because . . . the consequences of all that sweetness could be so fearful . . . . " Hennie , did you hear me ? I said do n't worry . Trust me . " " I will . I do . " " Listen to me , I know you . You 'll go home and have a bad conscience . But you must n't . We 've done nothing wrong . Can there ever be anything wrong about love ? " " No , " she whispered . " Of course there ca n't . " When she awoke the next morning , the thought flooded in instantly : I am different because of what happened yesterday . It seemed impossible that this difference , this great change , was not visible . Yet her father read the Times at breakfast and her mother hurried Alfie off to school ; everything was as always , the cereal , the iceman 's bell , and the mailman 's whistle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she stared at herself . After that , it was arranged between Dan and Hennie that whenever she could find plausible time , she would come to him . Arriving early , she would watch quietly while he finished his work in the orderly laboratory , so different from the room in which he ate and slept . Here , properly arrayed , were papers , tubes , coils of wire , filaments and tools . Sometimes Dan tried to explain what he was doing . " This is an amplifier . And here , this is hand-drawn copper wire , much stronger than ordinary copper wire ? " She had no idea what all this meant ; the words passed over her head , acknowledged by a vague smile . Always and only there was the longing for him . He was so absorbed ; with narrowed eyes , head on one side , he 'd whistle thoughtfully and pause to think , completely at ease with himself . Always at ease with himself and everyone . He spoke as he pleased , dressed as he pleased  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how amusing it was that , caring so little about his own dress , he yet had that quirk of noting how a woman looked or ought to look . " That yellow thing is very good on you . " He would turn suddenly . " Fm finished . Let 's go upstairs and take the yellow thing off . " She liked to bring food , to make or bake something at home on the pretext of taking it to the settlement house . She tidied the room as best  | she could , for Dan was careless and never threw anything away , whether old clothes , letters , or cracked dishes . Doing these things , she felt the marvel of making a life together in daily work and trust . She felt as good as married . Almost . The months flowed easily into one another and Dan was happy ; he talked no more of longing to be in a room with her behind a locked door . Hesitating to mention marriage , and wishing she could hide her flushed face , since , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the eager one , or so the novels all said , she nevertheless brought up the subject . " You see , I have to get some money ahead , " Dan replied . " I 'm a simple person , Dan , you know that . I do n't want a lot . I 'm as simple as you . " " We may be simple , but even so , we ca n't live here in this room , can we ? " i Glancing at the narrow bed , the single chair , and the milk bottle on the windowsill , she had to concede that . " Darling , I wish it could be tomorrow . But I shall have to get a little ahead . " " How is that to be done ? " she asked , keeping her tone steady . " I do n't know . I do n't know . Look about you . More soup kitchens , bank failures , unemployment . This is a full-blown depression , Hennie . True , I get a salary , but till I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much away , and now the need for giving is greater than it ever was . " " You 're still giving ? " " Not much , though it 's hard not to when I see my kids coming to school half asleep because they 've been up late making artificial flowers . But I 'm trying , I really am . Just be patient . " Alfie went to the Werners ' Adirondack camp and came back to entertain them at dinner with accounts of canoe trips and cookouts with trout he had caught . " It 's called ' roughing it in comfort . ' You should have gone , Hennie . You 'd have had a great time . " Alfie knew how to enjoy the pleasures of luxury . Nothing was ever wasted on him . " I 'm sure I do n't know why she did n't , " Mama said . Serving the dessert , she dropped the spoon into the pudding with a stern splash . " This insufferable heat ! Hanging around the settlement house all summer ! Nobody stays in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , except  | Bennie . Well , charity is one thing , but there 's no need to be a martyr for iI Alfie promptly reversed himself . " Oh , Ma , it was n't all that wonderful . And everybody does n't like the mountains , anyway . " Dear little Alfie , once a nuisance , and suddenly a grown-up ally ! Tears pressed the back of Hennie 's eyes . She was in terror that they might fall , one slow , piteous drop after the other , forcing her to flee from the room and later to face questions . Questions . . . The happy family at dinner . You could make a nice lithograph and put it in a gilded frame on the parlor wall : the father in his dark suit , the presiding mother , the jolly schoolboy son , and the marriageable daughter . Oh , if they knew ! Schemes and possibilities whirled through Hennie 's brain . Maybe Papa could offer Dan a job that paid more than teaching ? No , he would n't take it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job to offer . If ever there were one in that struggling partnership , it would go to Alfie . Pictures floated through her brain . White weddings . Music , blessings , and safety . Above all , safety . . . The months revolved and fall came again . She bought a copy of The Scarlet Letter . My God , what cruelty ! But that , after all , was two centuries ago , was n't it ? It 's not all that different now . She rarely stopped in to visit Uncle David anymore . When she did , he never mentioned Dan , which made her wonder what he knew or suspected . Maybe nothing at all . At the settlement house , Miss Demarest , with an expression both curious and envious , dropped remarks about " you and your young man . " She must have seen Hennie walking in the neighborhood with Dan . Even in a city as enormous as New York , one could not go unnoticed . Having a painfully growing need to confide in someone , she was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust her . But then , one day , somehow their conversation took a turn that made confidence impossible . " In Russia we had nothing , " Olga had said . " We still have nothing . But as long as I am with my husband , everything is bearable . " " Did you know each other a long time before you were married ? " " We grew up in the same village , but we did n't really know each other  | . . . and then all of a sudden it happened . You know how it is . . . we decided to get married . " Hennie 's thoughts moved gingerly , like fingers not quite daring to touch . " But surely you loved , you knew love , for some time before you were married ? " Olga looked up . " Knew love ? You do n't mean that we slept together ? Why , he would never do that before we were married . He 's not that kind of man . " Hennie flushed . " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course not . " She was , then , entirely alone with her secret . " We have n't seen much of Daniel Roth lately , " Angelique observed . Dan had n't been at Hennie 's house in weeks , since now they met elsewhere . When Hennie did not reply at once , her mother inquired , " Has he stopped courting you , then ? " " Courting ! That 's ridiculous . He 's my friend . Everything is not ' courting , ' as you put it , Mama . " " A man is either interested in something permanent or he is not . It 's as plain as that . And if he is no longer interested , I can tell you plainly that your father and I will be much relieved . We 'll be sorry for you , but you 'll get over it and be all the happier . " Hennie said coldly , " You were going out at ten o'clock , were n't you ? Well , you 're late , it 's ten after . " A man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eileen was singing in the kitchen , her song rising freely now that the lady of the house had gone out . Hennie went into her room and shut the door against that strong , cheerful voice . When had she really felt the beginning of the drift ? It was impossible to know precisely when . A drift was just that : gradual and vague , veering like a night breeze . Women glanced , inviting , and he responded . Nothing came of it really , except that whenever it happened , she felt left out and afterward , reflecting , humiliated by her own jealousy . She knew one thing : never to let him know that she saw or cared , lest she become that ridiculous creature , a suspicious and possessive woman . They had been at a beach picnic to celebrate the end of the school  | r ; that had been one time . There had been a lively group of teachers th wives and daughters . It was a marvelous day , too cool for bathing t perfect for walking on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in line , somehow arranged by twos , to the jetty and back . I find yself with Mr. Marston , the Latin teacher . Dan is ahead of us with the ughter , Lucy Marston . She is about my age and is as noisy as my other Alfie . Does she really think that her explosive laughter is allur-g ? Mr. Marston keeps talking about his wife , recently dead , and of the ponsibility he has to be both mother and father to Lucy . I am sorry r him , but I am bored with his troubles , although I offer the proper mpathy . My eyes are on Dan and the girl ahead . After all , I ca n't help ing them , can I ? The wind carries their voices away , all except her ' ggling treble , so I do n't know what they are talking about , but I can by Dan 's enthusiastic gestures that he is happy . When she stumbles in the sand , he offers his arm and they go on alking that way . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ck , I shall manage , I think , to walk back with him . But , still arm in arm , they swing about . Her brown hair has gold streaks . It 's beautiful hair . She has a pug-face like a doll 's , pretty but stupid . She does n't stop talking . Dan likes quiet women , he says . He ca n't bear chatter , he says . It 's time to eat . Some people have brought blankets to spread on the sand . I sit on the rocks beside Dan . Lucy Marston wanders uncertainly holding her plate , looking for a place to sit . Dan calls to her . " Over here ! There 's room . " He moves to make a place for her on his other side . I do not know if it is truly he who has invited her , or she who first made certain that he would . Something has been felt between them . Why does n't she find a man of her own ? I try to see the girl through Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear whites are almost blue . I study her , saying nothing , while they talk as if I were n't there . She has a lively energy that I do n't have . She raises her arms above her head to stretch , and arches her back as if she were in bed ; her body is an invitation and a promise . If I see it , surely Dan does . I imagine that he is imagining her in bed , and I feel such a terrible , frenzied jealousy that I could smash my fist into her face . . . . Was that day the beginning ? Hennie dared not ask . From time to time , Dan mentioned the girl . The mother 's death had been such a brutal shock . Lucy and her father had come home to find  | her dead in the parlor . She had never been sick . Terrible . Mr. Marston was a changed man . But Lucy was so spirited , he was lucky to have a daughter like her to cheer him . From time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new assistant at the library . A red-haired nurse at the settlement . So really it must be just a kind of game . A game of the eyes , of compliments and admiration . That was what Uncle Dan had seen and failed to understand . Yes , Hennie assured herself in moments of optimism , it is his way , harmless in spite of being painful to me . I will have to accept it . He must be loosely held and then he will always come back . And yet the second year was ending . On the Sunday before Thanksgiving they went for an afternoon walk in Central Park . The day was hazy , the air warm and still , vaguely depressing in a season that ought to be brisk . People wandered slowly ; children kicked at the piled leaves along the paths . A little group had gathered to watch an old man feeding pigeons ; earnest as a farmer going about his labor , he dipped his hand into the sack and scattered the grain . " Out of place in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks . " " He 's the same old man Paul watches when I bring him to the park . " And lines of a Stevenson poem , memorized at school , came to her suddenly , something about country places . " Where the old plain men have rosy faces And the young fair maidens Quiet eyes . " My eyes are not quiet , she thought . They walked on . They had spoken very little all the way . Presently Dan remarked that it was so warm , one scarcely needed a coat , that it was amazing weather , but that they would probably make up for it with tons of snow in January . " I suppose so , " she answered . A flock of sparrows rushed up out of the grass at their approach . " Funny , nobody feeds them , " Dan remarked . " Not pretty enough , I suppose . I call them the poor people because the Lord made so many of them . "  | You do n't even believe in the Lord , she thought , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparrows , when we should be king about ourselves ? Tell me , say it , get it over with . Say : I 'm tired of u , I 've changed my mind . Dan was staring at her . They had come to a stop in the middle of the h . " What is it , Hennie ? " Impatience crept into the voice of concern . ou look miserable . What 's bothering you ? " Humiliation stripped her naked in the park . Surely every passerby uld see her naked misery . As if he did not know ! Her lips were so dry that she could feel them sliding over her teeth . A mood , I guess . " " Well , you 're entitled to a mood . I 'll forgive you , " he said lightly . Forgive me for what ? she cried silently . How dare you forgive me ! Oh , , Dan , wo n't you understand ? I need to know where I 'm going ! They went on again , breaking the silence now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about things passing : a it of handsome collies , or a maroon barouche containing three girls in entical white feathered hats . They came out onto Fifth Avenue among the Sunday strollers , elegant pairs on their way to tea at the Plaza , and affable families taking the air after midday dinner . They caught the omnibus downtown . " I forgot to tell you , " Dan said , " there are some cousins of my mother 's coming in from Chicago . They 'll be staying at a hotel , since I surely have no place to put them up , but naturally I 'm obligated to take them around the city . They 've never been here . So the next week will be a busy one for me . " " Yes , of course , " Hennie answered quickly . When they got off at the last stop , she said , " You need n't walk home with me . No , really , I know you 've got things to do . " " Not coming back with me ? " Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to tea . Walter 's got one of his Sunday meetings . " He did not insist . " As a matter of fact , I can use the time . I 've a pile of papers to go over . " He smiled . " Cheer up , Hennie . The world has n't come to an end . " Oh , turn the knife in the wound !  | " I 'm very cheerful , I 'm quite fine , do n't worry about me , " she said , walking away . I will not look back to see whether he is looking after me . I will not But I have lost him . She had , in fact , not been expecting Florence ; the sight of the familiar carriage and dappled grays at the curb was a surprise . She went inside with a sense of dread , hoping there was other company in the house sir that the conversation would have to be impersonal . But Florence and Angelique were alone in the parlor with the inevitable tea service between them . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the important gossip , the marriages arranged for the sons and daughters ? " Where is Papa ? " Hennie inquired . " Taking his Sunday nap . My goodness , you look so pale ! " She answered without thinking , " It 's getting cold , a wind 's come up . " " Cold ! " Angelique said . " And Florence has just been complaining of the unseasonable heat ! Where have you been , Hennie ? " " For a walk in the park . " Over Hennie 's head , as she sat down , the glances passed and vanished . " Do try this cake . " Florence passed a plate . " My new cook made it She 's Irish , but surprisingly good . They are not famous for their cooking , as we all know . I do wish I could afford a French chef . Walter 's parents have one and he 's marvelous . " A congress of nations , Hennie thought . French chefs , Irish maids , and German governesses . An English butler would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach . . . Why do I pick on my sister 's foibles ? Because I 'm wounded and I need to lash out at somebody , that 's why . The conversation that Hennie 's entrance had interrupted was now resumed . " The furniture was all Louis Seize . Half the women wore tiaras . You ca n't imagine what a scene it was . I have been telling Mama about the Brocklchurst dinner . Another world , not Jewish , of course . I was really flattered to he invited , although it was a business thing , I do n't delude myself . The apartment must cost heaven only knows what . Twenty rooms on Fifth Avenue . I know Walter 's cousin pays one hundred a month for seven rooms on Fifth Avenue , so this one must have cost . . . " Florence 's voice trailed off in awe . " Right near the Harmonie Club they are . "  | " I have never been in the Harmonie Club , " Angelique remarked wist ( Iilly . " You would n't like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter 's parents , but it 's so German ! The Kaiser 's portrait in the hall ! And It 's just this year that German stopped being the official language . I wish it would stop being the official language in my in-laws ' house too . After all , they 've been forty years in America . And they still think of themselves as German . Carlsbad and Marienbad every other summer . " " It must be tiring to do so much traveling . " Angelique sighed . " Still , I wish your father could ? " " What do you wish I could ? " Henry inquired , coming in . " Travel , my dear , you have n't had a real vacation in years . " " I keep inviting you , " Florence declared . " Why not come to Florida with us this winter ? And you come with them , too , Hennie . " She swung round in her chair and faced Hennie . " Now , listen , I want your promise , your solemn promise , that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palms were wet . Sickening , dizzying speckles of light flashed in the air . " I 'll try , " she answered weakly . She felt ill . Her stomach heaved . She had been feeling like that quite often this last week or two . " What do you mean , you 'll try ? What else have you got to do ? " And when Hennie did not reply , " Or will you have something else to do ? " The question opened new possibilities in the room . " Let us not beat about the bush any longer . " Angelique clipped the words . " You have been seeing this Roth , and no one else , for too long . " Hennie bowed her head . In the line of her vision were shoes : Florence 's slim pointed toes , Papa 's feet  --  in scuffed boots , he needs new ones  --  planted on the rug , and her mother 's foot tapping . " What have you to say about it ? Anything , Hennie ? " What have I to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die for him , and he does not want me anymore . " Hennie ! Why are you looking like that , as if the end of the world had come ? " Funny , that 's what he said , the end of the world has n't come . She raised her head and put out her hand . " I would like some tea , you have n't given me my tea . " Maybe it would settle her queasy stomach . They had planned this conversation . This was no spontaneous thing .  | They had been waiting for her . It was for this that Florence had come on a Sunday . Now they made a semicircle around her , as in that engraving of the stag , cornered finally by the hounds . There was no way out , and hating them for what they were doing , she knew they were right . " What do you want of me ? What do you want me to say ? " she cried , shouting into the decorous room . " We only want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have we no right to know , no interest in you ? " Do n't be sick on the carpet . " All Mama means , " Florence said quietly , " is whether you have any ? any understanding . " This day had been too much , everything was too much , unbearable . Hennie 's look appealed to her father , begging him to stop this , to release her . But his head was down , reaming his pipe . He was not going to help , and for the first time she had no pity for him . " We know , " continued her mother , " that you have been seeing him more often than you admit . You may think you have been fooling us with your denials . Yes , for a while you did , we believed you , but all that has come to a finish , Hennie . It 's time for you to speak frankly , for all of us to speak frankly . " Oh , the little room where we took our joy , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak frankly about , " Hennie said . " Nothing at all . " " Perhaps your father should speak to him and find out what all this ' nothing ' amounts to . " This was not even decent , the hounds were ripping at her . 1 " No , no , " Hennie cried , adding then very faintly , " he needs more money . He ca n't afford ? " Angelique set her cup down . " What ? Then he is looking for a rich wife ? " " Mama , how can you say such a thing ? Of all people ! Dan cares nothing for money . He has no interest in wealth ? " The words choked her . " But you just said he needs more , so he has to care . Do n't be a child , " Angelique said , and touching Hennie 's arm , spoke with surprising gentleness . " Listen , Hennie dear , it takes money to run a home , you 're seeing that it does . Even a once-a-week cleaning woman costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it , does he say ? "  | " He 's a teacher . The salary is small . " " People do live on teacher 's salaries , though , " said Angelique , reversherself . Hennie did not answer . Someone walked in the apartment overhead d the crystal drops on the chandelier tinkled lightly . There was no her sound in the room . They were waiting for Hennie to say somemg . " I ca n't talk now , " she said . " I do n't feel well . Ca n't you see that I 'm iserable ? " " Yes , and that 's just why we 're talking now , because we do see and ve been seeing , " answered Angelique . " I 'm miserable because I 'm coming down with a cold , and I only want be let alone ! " Hennie shouted , causing them all to draw back . It crossed her mind that they had never heard her shout at them . Her ice had suddenly become a weapon . They all stood up . Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small bird , brightly blue , rched above a wreath of veiling . She spoke into the mirror , in which she could see Hennie . " We only mean your good , dear . But I see that this is not the best time to discuss anything . Another day , then . " Rennie stood at the window watching the bird and veil , the sable muff and velvet sleeves , disappear inside the carriage . She felt her father 's hand on her shoulder . " May I talk to you , Hennie ? Only for a minute , then go lie down . " Angelique had taken the tea tray into the kitchen , this being Eileen 's free afternoon . " Not now , Papa . " He could have come to her rescue ! Perhaps he had been too tired . He was always tired . Her father spoke quickly . " I do n't want anyone to hurt you , Hennie , that 's all . I know your mother and your sister care about things that do n't interest you , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way they show it , but they love you . You know that , do n't you ? " She nodded . The quiet tone and the warm touch of his hand brought the sting of tears . This time they brimmed over . She caught her father 's hand and laid it against her cheek . " This is all wrong , Hennie . " " What is , Papa ? " " I do n't know the man . "  | " You do n't like him ? " " I do n't know him , I tell you . And I 've let you be too free . I should n't have allowed it all this time . I do n't know why I did . " But I know why . Because you knew I needed to be loved and you did n't want to spoil it . Yes , I know . " Do n't worry about me , Papa , I 'll be all right . " Later in her room , in the early evening after the spasm of sickness had passed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The words came of themselves . " Dear Dan , I know you have grown tired of me . I wo n't plead or ask for any explanation . A person is perfectly free to love and to stop loving . Only be honest with me and say so . " She dipped the pen . The ink slid across the paper , making smooth curves and loops ; how odd it was that a pattern of arabesques so light and easy could spell out such a breaking ! And how was it possible for another human being to be so much a part of you as to break you in half by leaving you ? " I will make no scenes , " she wrote . He would tear this open when the mail came , or perhaps the letter would be waiting under the mail slot when he got home . Then he would sit down by the window at the table on which the crumbs from his breakfast roll would still be scattered , and would tear it open and read . feeling  --  feeling what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And would do what ? Come running to her in remorse ? No , it would not be that . He would say , " Yes , yes , it 's true , and I am so terribly sorry , but it 's over ; this is how it happened . I 'm in love with Lucy Marston  --  or somebody . " Her heart pounded , her head pounded , yet the pen moved on , offering her sacrifice , giving everything away . " There will be no blame . What I did I did to myself . There 's no use pretending something you do n't feel , and if you do n't feel anything for me anymore , you ca n't help it . But you must n't lie to me . It is not fair to lie to me . " After signing the letter , she sat for a while , sat up very straight and stiffened her back ; she was filled with a deep , mournful pride in her ability to bear so much pain . Then she lay down , exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . There was a chill in the household . Angelique spoke of ordinary things , as though nothing had happened . Yet all her words came out like  | a rebuke : We are observing the natural decencies , as you see , but do not think we have forgotten . We are only waiting . Bennie was starved for food . Five times during one afternoon she went to the kitchen , raiding the icebox , then the breadbox , tearing off the bread in a hunk , so that even Eileen looked astonished . She ate a chicken leg from the previous night 's dinner , drank a glass of milk , and ate an apple . When her stomach was empty , she felt sick . One morning she vomited . The fine machinery of her body was definitely out of order . She wished she had more knowledge . . . On the ether hand , she wished she had never gone peeking into Uncle David 's xtbooks . . . . Oh , my God , it ca n't be ! It 's something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . She had not heard from him . She thought of walking downtown , ying a game , a dangerous game with herself : How far will I go toward house before I turn back ? This was the hour when he sat near the indow correcting papers . He could look down into the street ; she could not risk the humiliation of having him see her searching for him . . . . One morning she was sent to the grocery store . A strange thing happened : She forgot what she had been sent for . Among the barrels of oatmeal and coffee she stood trying to recollect , feeling faintly dizzy . It was still early and the store was empty . Mr. Potter was being patient . Nevertheless , she felt painfully embarrassed . " Well , now , what could it have been ? " he asked . His red hands , rest-ing on the counter , looked like raw beef ; a sickening thought . He looks like a gnome . I wish I could tell him everything . I must be crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's think . Sugar ? Bread ? " Sugar , yes , sugar ! It all came back to her : a bag of walnuts for Sun-day 's cake , and butter . The butter had begun to melt . Along the sides of the crock it swam in fat yellow globules . Slick , greasy butter . Her mouth filled with water . She had to shut her eyes from the sight . Hurry , hurry ! She was going to be sick . Out on the street again , her reflection jumped out of Mr. Potter 's plate glass window . She looked like a pouter pigeon . Of course ! Of course , she was laced too tight , that 's why she had been feeling so ill . That 's why she was sweating as though it were still August .  | She stood at the curb , trying to decide whether to go home with the bag of groceries , or to find out once and for all . . . She went downtown . On Uncle David 's street the pushcarts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and potatoes . A horseless carriage , an unusual sight on such a poor street , came rattling to a halt when the bicycle chain came loose from the rear axle . The peddlers cursed , and a frightened horse tore away , pulling his wagon , while a pair of boys who should have been in school jeered at the luckless owner of the new contraption : " Get a horse ! Get a horse ! " The confusion , lasting no more than a minute , printed itself on Hen nie 's mind . I shall remember this , she thought queerly , although none of it has anything to do with me : the frightened horse and the dazzle of light on the dangling chain . Uncle David 's door was open , but the office was empty . She sat down to wait , picked up last week 's copy of Frank Leslie 's Illustrated Newspo per , and was unable to read . Without moving , almost frozen , she waited for , and also dreaded , the sound of Uncle David 's footsteps on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle David said , " the body is only a machine . Like the horseless carriage to the mechanic . That 's all there is to it . " She could not look at him . With the fingers of one hand she smoothed the nails of the other . Pink nails , neatly rounded and glossy as shells . " From what you tell me , " Uncle David said gently , " it 's pretty clear what 's the matter . But I shall need to look , all the same . " Burning , burning shame . Wherever does one find the courage to do this ? " Just lie down and put the sheet over yourself . I shall step out . When you 're ready , call me . " She lay quite still . The corset , the corset cover , the chemise and the petticoats lay on a chair . They looked ashamed , limp and exposed like that in a strange place . She closed her eyes so as not to see them , or the ceiling or anything . She called out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her and she felt cold metal . Her hands were clenched . I am not here . I am somebody else . The sheet was drawn up again . " Get dressed , " Uncle David said . " We 'll talk afterward . " His voice was dry , without emotion , and she knew he was suppressing a terrible anger . So it was true .  | Now panic shook her . A panic as awful as if she had been tottering on a cliff in a roaring wind , or as if she had been lying alone in an enormous house at night , with footsteps coming up the stairs . She made herself stand and fasten her clothes and tie her shoes . Tears poured ; she wept without making a sound . When Uncle David returned to the room , he said softly , " Do n't cry , liennie . " All the anger had gone out of his voice . But the tears still slid down her cheeks . The old man looked away . Drab , sorry sparrows , hunched in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windowsill . The old man watched them while he tapped with a pencil on the desk , making a little marching rhythm . After a minute he spoke . " Will you tell me about it , Hennie ? " When she opened her mouth , no sound came until , straining , she was able to whisper , " I ca n't . " " All right . I suppose there 's nothing to tell . . . it happened , that 's all . At least you love each other , and that 's what matters . " Yes , in his practical way , he was thinking as he always did , All right , It happened ; now we must think of what to do about it . And this , along with the absence of reproach and the swallowing of what must surely be his outrage , could have been such comfort , such strength on which to lean and take hope , except for those few words : At least you love each other . Her tears stopped . In desperation she looked around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelves . She made a vague gesture . " Is n't there some medicine  --  something ? " " Pe-Ru-Na ? " David 's smile was a rueful twist of the lips . " It will cure almost everything . But not this . " His eyes rested on Hennie , touching her softly , softly . " You will have to be married , " he said . " Right away . Really , right away . " Hennie bowed her head . " Right away , " Uncle David emphasized . He asked then , " Does he know anything of this ? " Hennie shook her head . " You must tell him today , Hennie . " Why so proud ? Put your head on this old man 's shoulder and cry it out : Oh , Uncle , you told me there are men who do n't stay with one woman , you told me.  | " I will say the baby came early . No one will question it when I say so . I will take care of it , Hennie . Now you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't know how I can do that , Uncle David . " " You will . " " You 're more sure than I am , then . " " You will do it because you have to . " His warm , firm hand , as he helped her with her coat , paused to press her shoulder . Opening the door , he reminded her , " Dear Hennie , the main thing is , at least you love each other . Just keep thinking of that . " She waited for Dan on the stairs . While , in the half darkness , he searched for the keyhole , she blurted what she had to tell . " Dan , I am having a baby . " What plans she had labored over during these last hours ! Whether to berate him for his neglect of her , or to beguile him with lace at her throat and a charming hat , or to seize his hands and be tender , or to weep , or somehow to make him jealous ( how , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered all of these and discarded them . Now , after all , she had crudely and simply flung the words I am having a baby . The door slammed back against the wall . He threw his coat  --  she had mended a burn-hole he had made in it at the lab  --  over the back of the chair and slid his armful of books into a pile on the table . She saw him catch his lip under his teeth . " How do you know ? " " I went to Uncle David this morning . " " Good God , not to him ! " " Why not to him ? " He struck a match to light a cigarette . The flame went out in his shaking fingers . " Was he sure ? Is it definite ? " " It 's definite . " How many times had she come running up the stairs to this room , running to find the door wide open and Dan with his arms outstretched and a glowing face , mischievous , bright with expectation ! They stood now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck another match and held it to the gas bracket ; a weak light seeped out into the dusky afternoon . " What did he say ? Was he in a rage ? "  | That we must be married right away . That the important thing is , we love each other . r " He did n't say very much . " " He must have said something . " Dan looked down at the floor . " I should think he 'd want to kill me . " " There would n't be much point in that , would there ? " " I 've ruined his good opinion of me  --  of us both . " " I do n't know . Mostly , I think , he 's just sorry . " Sorry . Sad , yet more than that . " A sorry sight , " one says , by which one means something sad indeed but also pitiable because it need not have been .. . . It came to her , in her misery , that she was thinking like an English teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . Dan caught the smile . He 's afraid I 'm going to be hysterical , she thought as he came to her . " Sit down here , take off your coat , maybe you should lie down . . . " She glanced at the bed and , moving past it , sat down in the chair at the window . She felt Dan 's hand on her shoulder . " Do n't be afraid , Hennie . We 'll have to be married quickly , that 's all . " His voice came to her as if it were an echo ; she had a queer feeling of unreality . And as if another voice , not her own , were answering , she heard , " You do n't want to . " " Hennie , I do ! For God 's sake , I do ! It 's just a little sooner than I ? but we 'll manage , it will be all right . " And he repeated , pleading , " Do n't be afraid . " " All this time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then you did n't talk about it at all anymore . " " I suppose I was afraid of the responsibility . The bills , the rent , I kept putting it off . Do n't think I have n't felt guilty . It would have been better for you if you 'd met someone else , not me . " Hennie put her face in her hands . Better to have met someone else , he said . She felt blank exhaustion ; everything just stopped . Everything . " Hennie , look at me . I 'm not proud of myself . Hennie , do n't cry . Please , I ca n't bear your tears . " " I 'm not . " She raised her head . Like death , he looked . This had brought him down . And she felt a vindictive triumph . " You 'll get over my tears soon enough . Miss Lucy Marston will help you do that . "  | " What in the name of creation are you saying ? " " I should think it 's pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ! What can you be thinking ? A girl . . . a pretty girl . . . there are dozens of them . . . everywhere . . . can a man not talk to a girl without somebody 's thinking that ? " he stammered , and stopped . It would be good to believe him . Maybe it was the truth . She stood up and , pulling the curtain aside , looked down at the lamplighter , who , moving along the street , made one sallow circle of light after the other in the growing darkness . Except for him , the street was empty . Dan urged , repeating himself , " We shall have to be married right away , Hennie . " She spun around . " No . I do n't want you to marry me because we have to . ' " Something rose in her , something heedless and strong , a surge of defiance that rose above the exhaustion . " I 'm worth more than that . I wo n't live with a man who will throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We never will . " " Never have an argument ? That 's ridiculous . How can you think that ? " " I meant I would never throw it up to you . ' You have my word . " " Your word is n't good enough anymore . " He asked quietly , " Then , what do you want ? " Leaning her head against the icy pane , she thought , I want it to be as it was in the beginning . I want you to look at me the way you did when we stood on the Brooklyn Bridge and you said , " I love you , we 'll have a good life . " " Hennie , talk to me ! Look at me . If you wo n't marry me , what will you do ? " " I do n't know . " She heard her own laugh , an ugly broken sound . " Kill myself , I suppose . " " My God , Hennie ! " " What difference would it make ? You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , though I ca n't imagine for what ? No , it 's quite true that it would make no difference . My family , you , the whole world would go on , would n't it , without me in it ? Oh , they would cry whenever they thought of me ; your conscience would torture you  --  for a few weeks  --  and it would be talked about among all my family 's friends :  | at do you think , the De Rivera girl , they say she . . . " Oh , no , not sible ! ' ' Oh , yes , my dear , I heard ' ? Then it would all be just as ore . But I , at least , would have nothing to trouble about . " The words lifted her , making her stand tall before him . And she leant every one of them . All at once her anger made her powerful . She horrified him . " Hennie ! Ah , do n't talk like that ! " He put his arms around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breath , his murmur , hovered over her head . " Do n't talk about dying . Please . You terrify me . " Rigidly she stood , her body resisting his tight hold . Not a word had he laid about the two weeks of silence , or the indifference before that . She became aware that he was controlling a sob . " I know I do n't always do what I ought . I 'm not good enough for you . I know that . Look up at me , Hennie , do . " He lifted her chin so that she was forced to see the tears in his eyes . " I never meant to hurt you . I 'm not always the easiest person to get Illong with . I blunder , I 'm not as considerate as I should be . But I 'll do better , believe me . " " I wish I could . " " You can ! Trust me . And I 'm so sorry . God , I 'm so sorry ! " You could not be lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Trust me , will you ? From now on ? " She was quite still , wanting , considering , hesitating . Then his tears broke her . The great hard lump of grief in her chest broke open , little pieces shattered and burst in her throat with cries and tears . She wept . " I do n't want to die ! I did n't mean what I said ! " " Of course you did n't . You 're going to live . Darling Hennie . " He kissed her hair . Their tears ran together on her wet cheeks . His mouth came down on hers ; they clung to each other . She was bathed in his heat . All the terror , the fear , the wrath and pride , melted away into a merciful relief . " You 're so good , so brave . " " I do n't know . " " Well , you are . Lovely and brave . " For long minutes they held each other . And at last Hennie smiled . " Tenderly , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forehead .  | " I 'll take care of you , Hennie . I 'll talk to Uncle David  --  even if he wants to kill me . " She was able now to laugh . " He wo n't want to kill you . " " I 'll take care of you . Do n't be afraid of anything . I 'm here . I 'll always be here . " Yes , yes , forget everything , ask no more , go back to the beginning . Angelique frowned . " I ca n't understand the sudden haste . Or why your father is going along with Daniel 's insistence . " " Papa 's happy for me . " " The whole thing 's a puzzle . All of a sudden your father has such good things to say : He 's so cultured , he 's a scientist . What does that matter ? " Hennie thought , It 's because Papa knows how sad I 've been . Or can it be possible that he suspects the truth ? Florence said , " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get properly ready . There 's no reason to hurry so , now that you 're engaged . " " Florence , we do n't want to wait . " " Well , then , we shall have to rush the invitations . You 'll come down my stairs , Hennie , I 'll have ropes of smilax on the banisters . . . " " You 're very dear to want to go to all that trouble , but I would rather have it very small , here at home . " " It would be beautiful in Florence 's house , " Angelique said , " I really think you should accept her offer . " " It would make Papa happy to have a wedding here . It really would . " " Perhaps she 's right , " Florence agreed reluctantly . " You know it has always hurt him that I was n't married from our home . " Angelique sighed , and Hennie thought , She has no enthusiasm . If I were marrying someone she approved of , she would not be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother was disappointed . " At least let me help you with your clothes , " Florence said , bright with energy and kindliness . " White velvet , perhaps ? Or maybe not velvet , the season 's so short for it . Brocade or watered silk would be better . Something you can wear afterward to formal dinners and get some use out of . You 're always so practical . " " I doubt we shall be going to formal dinners . " " Well , you 're certainly not going to hibernate in the heart of New  | ork ! So , we 'll go on Monday . Begin on Broadway with Lord &; Taylor . cCreery 's after that . Walter and I have decided to give you a check to rt you off . " Hennie scarcely heard . All was being taken care of . She was being en care of . True , one night she woke up with pounding heart from a nightmare in hich she was carrying a baby  --  so heavy it was ! ? and standing outside f Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ringing and ringing , and he would not answer , and in terror she knew he would not marry her . . . . Waking slowly , she felt for the ring , the chip of a diamond that had longed to Dan 's mother . She liked to twist it on her finger , to feel it as promise and proof . Then she laid the hand on the place where the secret life lay curled and waiting , the life Dan had put there , that tied them together . Incredible relief swept over her , like the gratitude of one who has been ved from drowning . For a long time she lay there , smiling in the dark . The boy Frederick , named after Dan 's father and immediately called Freddy , was unusually large and strong , Uncle David informed the family , for a seven-month baby ; they were very lucky that the birth had gone so well . The family came to the hospital , Hennie 's parents , and Florence and Walter with little Paul . " We 've sent a carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark blue British carriage fit for a crown prince . " Hennie and Dan had already bought a perfectly good wicker carriage with a parasol , advertised for thirteen dollars in the Sears catalogue . They would simply return it . One could n't hurt Florence 's feelings . " I do n't think you 'll take me to the park anymore , " Paul told Hennie . " Of course I will ! Why should n't I ? " " Because you have him , and you wo n't love me anymore . " Everyone laughed , except Hennie , who reached for Paul 's hand . " I will love you both . You 'll help me with Freddy and teach him , because you 'll always be the big boy . And Freddy will love you . You will love each other all your lives . " " But you will love him more , " Paul said seriously , " because he 's yours . " How wise Paul is ! Already he sees things as they are and can accept  | them . He is blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the child 's hand until he left . Then she was alone with Dan and the baby , who lay in a basket next to the bed . Dan knelt to bring his face on a level with hers . He had brought roses and a little cloth cat . " You and this boy . " His voice wavered . " I do n't deserve you . " She stroked his hair . " Do n't say that . It 's not true . " " Yes . . . these last months , being together , I 've seen all the goodness in you . I 'm ashamed of some of the things I 've done . You do n't know how I ? " Intensely moved , she whispered , " I do n't want to hear . We 're together , that 's enough . " He straightened up . " All right . You know what I did just now ? Bought concert tickets . There 's a new piece by Debussy , Afternoon of a Faun . They say it 's beautiful . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well again ? I 'm well now , I could n't be better . " When Dan went home , she was left alone with the baby ; a little mound under a white blanket , he slept on his stomach , revealing only half of a mottled face and some tan hairs on a naked skull . One hand lay above the blanket ; the tiny fingers were trying to grasp the smooth sheet . The lips moved , and leaning closer , Hennie could see a flicker of the white perfect eyelids ; it seemed to her that he might be dreaming of food . For minutes , propped on her elbow , Hennie observed this marvel she had made . The shifting sun poured drowsy heat into the room , and she lay back on the pillow . Incredible that he had been alive , only a few hours before , inside her body ! At the same time she was amused at herself ; surely every woman , giving birth , must feel the same astonishment . As if there were anything original in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm here . We 're a family with a future , and I know at last who I am.  | It is the last night of the year , indeed the last of the century , and there is in the air the splendid tension that precedes a holiday , along with the regret that comes from leaving a familiar place . Hennie looks around at the gathered family . We were together in the last hours of the nineteenth century , we will say , years from now ; we will talk about it and there will be something elegiac in the telling . For a moment she sees herself in some far-off year to come  --  old , sitting in some vague room in a large chair , probably a wing chair , with her feet crossed and her spotted hands folded  --  and shakes herself free of the image . All evening she has had a lovely sense of well-being . All is orderly in the home ; there is enough of everything but not too much . Only the silver tea service , one of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Civil War , is out of place : rotund , filigreed , and gadroon-edged , the pots and kettles stand on the plain Mission table . " Mission furniture ? " Florence questioned when they bought it . " That square , homely stuff ? " " Dan does n't think it 's homely . " " It has no true style . It 's a fad for the masses . "  | " It 's made for the people , solid and simple . That 's why Dan likes it " She has never wanted the things that Florence and Mama want . It is wrong to own so much that one does n't need . Besides , clutter depresses her . Dan has made their rooms cheerful . He has painted the walls and ceiling white , quite out of style when dark flock wallpaper is the fashion But rich dark colors close in on you , while white opens out to the world , to sun and air . The apartment is sunny . From the kitchen window , Hennie can look down on the green yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block distant . She has sewn sheer curtains and Dan has built bookshelves . It gives her pleasure to watch the shelves fill up , for books are their one extravagance . They look neat in their rows ; neatness has always given Hennie a sense of comfort and completion . Fortunately , there is a large closet in the back hall where Dan , who has no such need for tidiness , can toss his belongings ; papers and pamphlets along with every letter he ever received spill out of shelves and boxes onto the floor . Hennie smiles to herself now ; the closet is a reflection of Dan  --  large , careless , free , and bold . Her eyes move to the old upright on which he has begun to give piano lessons to Freddy . Her eyes tend to rest on everything that is Dan 's . And that fine sense of well-being comes over her again . They have eaten well : turkey and turnips , potatoes , rolls and homemade jellies . Now , with dinner over , fruit and cake are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An excellent dinner , " says Hennie 's mother . " I do admire the way you 've learned to manage . I grew up not knowing how to boil water and , for goodness ' sake , everybody knows I still ca n't do it ! Yes , an excellent dinner , although I must say one does miss greens in this climate , having to wait till summer for a taste of something fresh . Unless , of course , one can afford hothouse vegetables and fruits . Oh , wherever did you get those ? " she exclaims as Dan comes bearing a small pyramid of oranges in a bowl . " A present from Florence and Walter , " he replies . Angelique is pleased . " Florence thinks of everything , does n't she ? Too bad they could n't be here , but they had a formal dinner to go to . There are some obligations one just ca n't refuse . " Alfie comes galloping down the hall with Freddy on his shoulders ; the child 's skinny legs in their black cotton stockings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know I saw elephants at the zoo ? " he cries . " They eat with their nose ! " " No , " Paul corrects . " They only pick up the food with their long noses . The mouth is underneath , do n't you remember ? " Freddy laughs , showing perfect little teeth . He has a short upper lip , quick to tremble with every emotion . " If I had n't seen him when he was a minute old , " Dan likes to say , " I would swear he 's not ours . He 's too beautiful . " This is praise ; yet there is something doubtful in it . Although he is fair-haired , the child is unmistakably Dan 's son ; the cleft chin , the rounded forehead , and the heavy-lidded eyes are Dan 's . But he is small for a six-year-old , fearful and frail . " I want to see the elephant again , and the monkeys , " Freddy demands now as Alfie puts him down . " Paul , you said we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too cold in the winter . We 'll go back to the zoo when spring comes . " Paul is Freddy 's favorite love . After him comes Uncle Alfie . He has no bond with any child of his own age ; Paul and Alfie are beloved because they are gentle with him . Hennie understands that clearly , but she does not speak of it to Dan . For some reason , perhaps because she fears Dan will not like to hear it , she keeps the knowledge to herself . Alfie , setting Freddy down , catches Hennie 's look and gives her a jolly wink . Alfie is happy ; he is almost always happy , but more so tonight , because he has brought with him the girl he wants to marry , the serene Emily , daughter of the formidable Hugheses , whose opposition to the marriage looms like a mountain . His own parents ' opposition looms , too , although it makes not quite as high a mountain . Emily stands at the desk in the corner where Uncle David is showing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Courteously , she listens to the enthusiastic old man . Her pale hair , caught high by a tortoiseshell comb , crowns her symmetrical Saxon face ; she is placid and somehow ageless . She looked like this when she was a child and will not look very different when she is old . Now , with her head bent over the book , her slender neck is pitiably tender . It is all too complicated , Hennie thinks , when it deserves to be so simple . Only wanting to be together ! Yet some force in the world seems to want to keep people apart . In this case , it is religion . In my case . . .  | I do n't know . We never talk about it . She closes her eyes for an instant , as if to blot out the thought . Then she looks back at Emily . They must decide soon ; Alfie must not make her wait . It is the cruelest thing for a woman . Hennie 's lips move involuntarily , angrily , without a sound , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment and begins to cut the cake . " It 's a Russian cream cake , and it 's the first time I 've made it . I hope it 's good . One of my old pupils  --  my friend Olga  --  gave me her mother 's recipe . I made an extra to give to her ; she has no place to bake , no place for anything , really , since her husband died . Tuberculosis , as usual . She and her little girl , a darling child , have to board . I 've never seen the place , but I can imagine it . Here , take this plate , Paul . " " I 'll need a bigger piece than that , " Paul complains . " I do n't know where you put it , " Angelique remarks fondly . " It 's a good thing you do n't run to fat like your Uncle Alfie . " Paul runs a finger inside his Buster Brown collar . His mother has made him dress up for this visit and he has arrived to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best clothes , complete with a Windsor scarf tied in a flopping bow , more suitable to his parents ' parlor , certainly , than to this one . Paul is almost a man . Contained within the form of the twelve-yearold boy is the design of the man he will be . He has a thoughtful , rather formal expression , contradicted every now and then by his lively curiosity . One might say  --  and people do  --  that he looks aristocratic . How Dan despises the word ! thinks Hennie , who does not often use the word herself . Nevertheless , it does describe Paul . One sees it in his posture and in his steady gaze , so strikingly blue in the dark face . Spirit and strength are there . Suddenly troubled , Hennie tries to recall what he was like six years ago , at the age Freddy is now . Paul was bolder . Without fear he approached strange dogs ; he sailed his boat in the Central Park lake , fell in , and was pulled out laughing . Whereas Freddy hangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick , but he wo n't play and wrestle , even with Dan . She wonders whether he is perhaps a musical genius . Dan says he has talent . Or is she merely the doting mother of an only child ? Oh , the world is so tough ! On East Side streets rove gangs of homeless boys , some as young as Freddy , sleeping in hallways , running errands for pay in pennies , to the saloons and worse places than saloons . A merciless  | world . The child would never be able to survive in it . Thank God , he will not have to . Strange , that when she considers such a possibility for Paul , who most assuredly will never even have to pass through such streets , she can quite easily imagine him set down in that world and somehow coping with it . Now Freddy challenges Paul : " I 'll beat you at checkers . " They get out the board and lay it on the floor . " Paul is so patient with Freddy , " remarks Angelique . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And why Paul has n't got one , why Florence does n't want more children , I 'll never understand ! Hennie 's thoughts are bitter . In her place , I would have five children . The time Dan said he would not let it happen , it did . Now for six years we have been wanting another , and nothing happens . " Yes , " Angelique continues , " it 's too bad Paul has n't a brother , then he would n't be bothering you at your house so often . " " Mama ! He does n't bother ! He likes it here and we want him . " Surely she must know that Paul is n't attracted to this house just to play with his little cousin ! Of course he is amused by the younger boy , but he really comes because he loves the style and the freedom of their home . Dan , a fine teacher , makes him feel important . She can see them at the kitchen table talking while she is cooking , talking about politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everything under the sun . Dan is vigorous and earnest , making patterns in the air with his hands as he illustrates and explains . Paul is eager and impatient , sometimes argumentative . Always they are in the kitchen , because the fruit bowl and coffeepot are there and because Dan is most comfortable in the kitchen . She wonders whether he and Freddy , when Freddy is twelve , will be the same with one another . Now she becomes aware that Uncle David is looking at her . " What are you looking at , Uncle ? " " At you . You 've grown so pretty . But then I always said you would . " She is not " pretty . " It is true , though , that a change has been made in her ; she has acquired a bloom , so that one is now more than ever aware of her rich hair and her leaf-shaped eyes . Dan has done it , it 's he who has taught her . She remembers standing with him at the window of the salon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winsome faces , and being urged to go in . Dan likes a woman to be well-groomed ; he  | points them out , the vivid ones , the smooth ones . . . And each time a tiny chill of fear darts through her and is suppressed . " You do look well , " Angelique , who has overheard , says critically . " It 's a wonder , too , hard as you work keeping the house , caring for the child , and still giving time at the settlement house to your poor families . " " I only do what I like , " Hennie answers mildly . " Well , you are two busy people , " Mama says . She is leading up to something . " Florence mentioned that Dan is being made head of the science department . " " It 's not official yet , that 's why we have n't talked much about it . " " And he 's still doing his experiments ? " " Oh , yes , he spends every spare minute in his lab . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much for me to understand , I have to admit . " Mama speaks in her dry voice of polite disapproval . " It must be fascinating . Still , there 's no money in it . " Uncle David speaks up . " I 'm sure he does n't do it for that reason , Angelique . " " But you could make a lot of money if you wanted to , Dan , " Alfie says . Dan seems to be amused . " How is that , Alfie ? " " Well , I 'm no scientist , but from what I read , there 's a lot of stuff being done like the stuff you talk about . There was something in the paper about sending electricity through the air , some fellow 's idea , and J. P. Morgan 's building a tower somewhere on Long Island for it . Two hundred feet high . Fellow stands to make a fortune , I should think . " Paul is interested . " What do you mean , sending electricity through the air ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , that 's what I read . Sounds impossible , does n't it ? " " It 's not impossible , " Dan says quickly . " It will come sooner than you think . " " Well , then , I 'm right ! " Alfie cries . " Why do n't you try to sell something like that , Uncle Dan ? " Dan answers him , " Those men are geniuses . I 'm no genius , neither financial nor scientific . I just plod along and I 'm satisfied that way . " He is shutting Alfie off , nicely but definitely . " Now , how about making that lemonade you and Emily were talking about ? "  | None of you in this family , except Uncle David , understands him , Hennie thinks . Not you , Mama , who measure things by what they cost . Nor you , Florence , with your dull , tailored man who " provides so well . " Can you ever know what it is to look at your man across the room in a crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he 's worth more than any other man there ? Or to wake up sometimes in the middle of the night with him lying there next to you , and feel that flooding sweetness that is so sweet you could almost cry with it ? The sound of Dan 's laughter comes now from the kitchen , where he has followed Alfie and Emily . His laughter has a special note of gaiety that tells her he is enjoying himself enormously . He comes back now carrying the pitcher , and pours two glasses for Papa and Uncle David . He is good to them both , especially to Papa , who is growing old , going downhill faster than Uncle David . " That Alfie certainly knows how to pick a girl , " Dan says . " She 's a fine one , all right . Heads are going to turn when he walks in with her , wherever he goes . " Angelique reproves him . " Fine she may be , but hardly our first choice , as even you can understand . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure you understand that your son is n't her parents ' first choice , either . " " Choice ? They 're in terror that something will come of it every time Alfie crosses their doorstep ! " Dan shrugs . " Perhaps nothing will . At his age a man can expect ten love affairs before he 's through . If he is ever through , " he adds mischievously . Uncle David 's glass has traveled halfway to his mouth ; he sets it down with a clink . " Any man worth his salt knows when it 's time to be through . " He snaps the words . " Either keep a woman 's trust or leave her alone in the first place . Either or , and no two ways about it . " Dan makes no comment but busies himself with the pitcher and the tray . Uncle David brings the glass back to his lips . Over the rim his old eyes catch Hennie 's for a fraction of an instant before concealing themselves again behind the protection of his glasses and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those kind , clever eyes ? Anything new that Hennie does not know ? Or have they revealed only a flickering recall of words once spoken , and never spoken since ? Probably so . When  | the darting doubt pays its unwelcome visits  --  just now and then , and mostly in the chill of a night of poor sleep  --  Hennie keeps it to herself . It is essential to her peace that doubt be stifled . Talking about it would only make it more real . . . . Angelique is caught up in her own worries . " I certainly hope he 'll have another love affair , as many as he wants . I 've nothing personal against Emily , but " ? here she becomes indignant ? " I would despise one of those drab interfaith marriages with a judge officiating or , worse yet , God forbid , a clerk at City Hall . " She sighs . " But what can we do ? You may be sure we 've talked to Alfie , but we can hardly tie him up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a rebellious animal , " Dan says . " The more you try to tie him , the harder he 'll try to get away . " There is no answer to that , and no one makes any , not even Uncle David . The mantel clock strikes the half hour . " Thirty minutes to go before the twentieth century begins , " says Alfie . " Half past eleven ! Oh , Freddy 's falling asleep over the checkerboard , " Hennie says . " Dan , he belongs in bed . " " Let him see this new year in . It 's something he 'll remember . " " Yes , you 're right , " Hennie agrees , and is struck again with a feeling for the drama of the hour . " What a splendid century it will be ! I feel great events coming , although I ca n't imagine what ! " " Ah , but the last one had its splendors too , " says Uncle David , who is thinking how little of the new century he will live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroes ? " " And it goes out in shame , " Dan interrupts , " with a dirty war in Cuba . " " True , true . " Uncle David sighs . " However , " Dan resumes briskly , " I do n't lose confidence . This twentieth century will be better , Hennie is right . The young will make it better . " The clock rattles , lurching toward midnight . They open the windows and lean out into the freezing air . The city is almost as light as day ; every light  --  gas , electric , or candle  --  must be ablaze . Down in the street , a crowd is massed . Tin horns squawk and blare ; whistles shrill and someone beats a drum . Suddenly a tremendous shout goes up , a roar like thunder or surf , as if every throat in the city has opened to hail the first of January . " Twelve o'clock . Nineteen hundred , " Dan says .  | For a moment they are all stilled . Then the spell breaks . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , held in his father 's arms , is allowed a sip of wine . Coats are collected as the gathering breaks up . Alfie and Emily have embraced without embarrassment . Henry and Angelique have decorously kissed each other . Hennie and Dan , looking into one another 's eyes , decide to wait until the house is quiet and they are alone . Their bodies , joined and now released , have made a golden heat in the winter night . Dan laughs . " How wonderful it is ! " he says . " Do you ever think how really wonderful it is ? " " Yes , always , " she whispers seriously . She marvels that they have given one another so much joy , that she has given it to him , and can again , and will . " No one would think , to look at you , that you could be like this , " he tells her . " You do look like such a lady , you know . " " Surely not prim ? " She is anxious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very earnest , very correct . But that 's all right . " He chuckles . " Let people think what they want of you . I have you . I know you . " She kisses his neck . " You do have me . Always . You and only you . " " Well , " he says in mock indignation , " I should hope so ! If any man thinks he can  --  well , he 's risking his head ! " But you ? she thinks . Hands that linger a little too long when hands are shaken or a coat is helped on ; eyes that call and answer , that sparkle and glint No , no ! You imagine things , Hennie ; you remember too much ; after all this time , here in this home that you 've made together , with your beloved child asleep under this safe roof , here in your husband 's arms , you still remember . But you must n't , you ca n't . In the name of wholeness or sanity , in the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yourself that everything is exactly what you want it to be . " Hennie ? " " Yes ? " " Dear heart , " he says . Dear heart . This is his loving name for her . " We 've come a long way together . " " Yes. , ,  | " You 're a marvelous woman . You 're so good for me . You make peace for me . " She is good for him . She knows it 's true . " The boy had a good time tonight , did n't he ? " " Oh , yes , he felt important . " Dan yawns . " If we go to sleep right now , we can wake up early enough to start the day right , if you know what I mean . " She knows . " Oh , have n't you had enough ? " she asks , moving closer . " It 's just that they say what you do on New Year 's Day , you 'll do every day all year . That would really be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hennie laughs . " Very nice , darling . " No , there is no doubt that she pleases him . A man ca n't pretend . If she were only sure that she is the only one . . . . Stop it , Hennie . Stop it right now . " I 'm falling asleep , " he says . " Me too . " She closes her eyes . The warmth makes her drowsy at last . She seems to be seeing pink through her lids as sleep comes . Why , it 's nine whole years since the fire that changed their lives ! And still they love each other , and always will . Of course they will . . . Wo n't they ?  | Beneath the pastel shimmer of the time that has come to be known as the Belle Epoque , with its sensuous , curvaceous art and its exotic music , under all the lavish beauty , the bottom seethed , sullen and dark . A long line of anarchists , beginning with the assassins of the Italian king , the Austrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe and America . Groups less radical but equally determined ? socialists , suffragettes , and advocates of disarmament  --  met and marched , petitioned and wrote . Crusading journalists and novelists exposed the corruption of the cities , the filth of the stockyards , the evils of child labor , and the brutalities in the Pennsylvania oil fields . In New York City there were rent strikes and meat strikes . Housewives rioted in the streets and poured kerosene on overpriced meat . Twenty thousand shirtwaist workers struck for decent wages and conditions . " They 're working seventy hours a week for less than five dollars ! It makes me sick to wear this Gibson Girl thing , " declared Hennie , plucking at the spiraling white ruffle on her shirt . " Do you know , Dan , they have to pay for the chairs they sit on ? Pay for their own needles and  | their lockers and put up with . . . advances . . . from the men be-sides ? " " Oh-ho . " Dan laughed . " ' Advances , ' hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrageous ! Here , help unbutton me . How is a woman supposed to get in or out of this thing with all these slippery little buttons down the back ? Unless she has a lady 's maid or a husband to help her to bed . " Dan 's face appeared in the mirror above her head as he bent to the buttons . " Indignation becomes you , " he said , and kissed the back of her neck . " Oh , Dan , I feel this more than I 've felt almost anything ! It 's personal . I know so many of the girls . They almost all come into the settlement ; they 're so young and here alone , just off the boat , lots of them from Italy this past year or two . " Dan was abruptly serious . " They ought to unionize , of course . " " I know . But they all hope to get married and quit , so the union organizers have n't ever gotten very far with them . And then I think of Olga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . . . " She paused , reflecting . " You know , I ought to be doing something . " " You ? What can you do ? " " I could picket , for one thing . I could at least do that . " In the second month of the strike the girls still marched outside the factory . Two by two they paced , carrying their defiant placards ; their defiant songs in Yiddish and Italian rang with vigor . When one dropped out because of sickness or discouragement , two came to take her place . Oh , it was cold ! The January wind slashed around the corner of the street at which , after fifty paces , they turned and walked back . Hennie came every day while Freddy was at school . Whenever she could , she found her place beside Olga Zaretkin . " You ought to take my coat , " she said one day . " It 's a lot heavier than yours . You 're shivering . " The girl 's thin coat was held up protectively around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glove . " Not at all ! Why should you do that ? " Olga was indignant . " I do n't need ? " The words were cut off by a spasm of coughing . " I was n't trying to embarrass you . Let 's not quibble , Olga . Your coat 's like paper and you 're sick . " There was no answer . They trudged , their feet squelching in the  | mucky brown snow . The wind fought with the placards borne high on flimsy sticks , trying to wrench them out of numb hands . An automobile passed deliberately close to the curb ; girls squealed and jumped to escape the spattering slush , while the driver laughed with contempt . But a workman on top of a wagon tipped his cap as the vanguard of a small procession reached the corner for the fiftieth time that day , wheeled , and turned back down the block . " Olga , " Hennie persisted . " You should n't be here at all . You should be seeing a doctor . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decent living ? No , this comes first . " Olga had a faint accent , no more than a Russian countess who had learned English from her governess might have . " Besides , I know what 's the matter with me anyway . " Indeed , one did not need much knowledge of medicine to recognize tuberculosis , the East Side killer . The pink-petal flush , and that peculiar luminous beauty of the eyes , were both as typical as the cough . " Of course , I know you have n't been feeling well , you 've told me ? " " Come , Hennie , call it what it is ! " " But . . . you never know , a doctor might ? " " Might what ? You said before , let 's not quibble . " She is going to die as her husband did ; she knows it quite well . In a few more months she will be too weak to get out of bed . She will lean over the side and spit blood . The fever will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gets pneumonia out here first . Then it will come sooner and more mercifully . They walked in silence to the end of the block . Hennie glanced down , for Olga was much shorter than she ; most women were ! Still , Olga 's steps kept pace : one-two , one-two , turn at the corner and back . The second hour and the third . Why ? Since she would certainly not see the benefits of this strike , if there should ever be any ! Surely it would be easier for her to join with the poor frightened handful of scabs who , protected by double ranks of burly toughs , went scurrying into the building every morning . " I worry so about Leah . " The wind muffled the sound so that Hennie , not sure she had heard , asked Olga to repeat it . " I worry about Leah . She 's only eight and a half . " " No family here at all ? " Hennie asked , although she knew the answer . " Not here , not there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they burned our house . "  | ! ; Immediately Hennie saw it all : orange flames and black figures , pursued and struck down . She heard shots and wailing and the final silence when it was over . She felt now Olga 's silence of recollection . It was necessary to speak , to make it bearable . " I have n't seen your Leah in so long . . . " Hennie was guilty and ashamed . She had been concerned with so many things that she had neglected her friend . " I wish we had a good place to live . It 's not right for her this way , living with strangers . They 're good people , they struggle , with five children . They sew pants , the whole family , even the children work . Oh ! " Olga cried . " What will become of Leah ? " And now she looked Hennie full in the face , while her question hung in the cold air between them . One had to look away from such terror , such anguish ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 's good at numbers . I suppose she could grow up and II , be a cash girl , " Olga said . " They take them as young as twelve , for one dollar seventy-five cents a week , a sixteen-hour day . . . she 'll be pretty , too , which is another worry . I do n't say so because she 's my child , I 'm not a fool . But you 'd know what I mean if you saw her . Do n't look at me , she does n't look anything like me . " " There 's nothing wrong with the way you look , " Hennie said gently . Olga pinched her lips into the shape of a suppressed smile , full of bitterness . The smile said : That was a stupid remark . It had nothing to do with the case and you are stupid , too , if you are trying to make me feel good . I am talking about life and death , do n't you understand ? All this was in the bitter smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know what to tell you , Olga , " she said honestly then . " I wish I did . God knows . All I can say is , I 'll try to keep an eye on her . " Keep an eye on her ! What did they mean , those banal , weak words ? " I do n't know now whether I 'll be able to help , " she continued . " Maybe if we win in this place , conditions will change and they 'll pay a living wage , with decent conditions , some sort of future . " What did that have to do with a child , alone in the world ? " It will take a long time . A long time to pass laws . And scabs ? " Hennie interrupted , relieved to change from the subject of Olga 's child . " There have n't been any in over a week . " She gazed up at the building . The grimy windows were blank , with drawn shades . A prison . A gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died . Hennie shuddered and shook herself . Then she spoke ' skly . " That may be a good sign , that they 're not going to try anymore . It 's t working out for them . Maybe they 're going to give in , partway at st , enough to meet and talk . There 'll be a union . . . They turned again at the corner . The block seemed to be growing longer and longer . How many more times before the relief arrived ? It was too much trouble to take off gloves and fumble with freezing hands r her watch . No matter , anyway . When the time was up , she would now . It was so still . The sounds of shuffling feet and passing traffic grew remote in the women 's ears . A numbness began to possess them . They ' moved mechanically , gasping with the cold . One by one , they had stopped singing and talking . Speech only used the energy they needed now to move their feet : uF and down , turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore on , the whole long , gray unbroken day . It shattered into a thousand pieces . When the smash came , the narrow column wheeled about . On the instant , without seeing , the strikers knew what it was that had come pounding at their backs . They had seen it before . From around the corner , with savage , insane cries , as if the sound of their voices could strike its own terror  --  which it could  --  came a dozen or more men on the half-run . Street thugs they were , of the familiar type that loiters in bars and pool halls . Huge-shouldered in jackets and sweaters they came ; they fell upon the women , shoved them , beat them with raw fists , swore at them , and scattered them . They wrested the flimsy cardboard signs out of frozen hands . Some of the women , thus pushed off balance , fell screaming ; others , small as they were in contrast to their attackers , put up an astonishing fight . In Italian , in Yiddish , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their small fists , kicked and beat at their attackers with the frail sticks and placards on which they had demanded justice . The street came alive . Windows on the other side , which had revealed no signs of life all day , were raised ; from every one heads poked , crowding to the sight of the struggle below . And rushing to the factory door , heads down , with furtive glances at that struggle , went a file of pathetic shamefaced women , some old , some young , all desperate for work . The door opened briefly to admit them and closed behind them with an echoing clang .  | Now the hired toughs were driven into fury . They had not expected such desperate resistance from the striking women . They had not expected to be kicked and scratched , had not expected such united strength . And they brought fuller force to bear ; out of nowhere came bricks and clubs , as well as shrill calls for the police . In the confused chaotic struggle , Hennie had been slammed against the factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had lost sight of Olga , but suddenly , through a tangle of knees and shoulders , she saw the familiar red woolen hat on the pavement and Olga sobbing on the ground beside the hat . A man 's knee pressed her down , grinding into her chest , while her frantic hands scratched at his face . There was no thought in Hennie , only a crazy rage on behalf of her friend . She leapt . She tore at the man . " You savage , you ape , you 're not fit to live ! " She clawed him , kicked his ankles , and pulled at his shoulders to topple him ; but he was too heavy and she could n't move him . She heard herself howling like an animal . Why , why was he doing this to Olga , frail as a bird , not half his size ? Because he loves it , loves her pain and her sobs . Hennie bit him . She sank her teeth into his earlobe and bore down . She heard him scream , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her head that dropped her on the ground . How long she lay there , she did not know ; it could not have been long before the women were bested . The brawl could not have lasted more than five minutes . She awoke to a clear instant of unreality , thinking : I must have fainted , I never fainted before in all my life , but that 's what I must have done . My face is warm , no , it 's burning hot and it hurts ; I think my nose is bleeding . She became aware of someone standing over her . A policeman . She stiffened . One knew that the police could be brutal . But this one helped her , although not too gently , to her feet . He was young , fresh-faced , with disdain like a veil over the youthful freshness . " For shame , " he said , " a lady . Or supposed to be . " Because of my good coat , Hennie thought , he takes me for what he calls a lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , they always Red when the police came . Only a few of the women were left , the bravest . The rest had fled too ; one could n't blame them . " I 've got to arrest the lot of you , " the officer said , surveying the poor  | ainder . " Will you come along decently or will we have to put handffs on you ? " His voice was proudly resonant . He played his part ; the watchers at tie open windows across the street , and the curious passersby for whom the sidewalk was now free and open , were his audience . For some reason Hennie found herself the spokeswoman . " We 're decent women , so we 'll go decently . But why do we have to ? What have we done ? " " Disturbed the peace . Brawling on the city streets when you ought to be home tending to your families . " " It 's not your business to tell us what we should be doing with our lives , as long as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hennie said hotly . The officer looked her up and down . It was apparent that something about her puzzled him . He could n't place her . She did n't seem to be a worker , not the way she handled the English language . But she was n't one of those eccentric society women either , one of those who liked to get themselves mixed up in this kind of business , and had to be handled with extreme politeness lest their husbands complain to the commissioner . " Now listen here , lady , " he mocked . " Lady . . . I 'd advise you to keep your mouth shut or you 'll have another charge against you . Resisting arrest . " He caught Hennie 's elbow . " I 'd advise you further to step into that wagon with the rest of your lot . " Oh , you hero , you upholder of the law against criminals like us ! Olga was coughing , holding a handkerchief to her mouth . " Are you all right , Olga ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! Your face is turning black and blue ! And the blood ! " " The blood 's nothing , only a nosebleed . You know , if I 'd had a gun , I would have killed that man . " " Less talking there ! And step lively . " Two taxis had stopped alongside while the pickets were climbing in . They were crammed with passengers , all laughing , who now got out to watch the affair . " Well , look at that bunch , will ya ? " " Never saw an uglier crew in all my born days . " " Hey , sister , what you need is a man ! " " That 'll cure what ails you ! "  | Hilarious , they pointed and hooted . Hennie stared back at painted faces , fancy plumes , and soiled silks . Poor , wretched , stupid things , ready for their night 's work , victims as much as any of these others who were striking for a decent wage ! Except that these , unaware of their shame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon drove away to the sound of their tittering malicious laughter . At the station house , the sergeant behind the high desk looked down on a bedraggled lot . If he felt any pity , he did not show it ; if he felt disdain , he did not show that either , as the younger man had . One wondered what he could be feeling , dressed in the authority of good dark blue cloth with a double row of brass buttons . Well , he had his job to do ; he had no choice . One by one , they were called before him . " I 'll have to set bail . Two hundred dollars , " he said . From each woman in turn came a gasp . One ventured , " We 're not criminals ? " " Resisting arrest is a crime , " the sergeant said . He raised his voice . " Two hundred dollars . If you wish to use the telephone to contact your lawyer , there 's one at the desk , and Officer McGuire will assist you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one shall I call ? The one who handles my real estate investments , or the one who does my trust fund ? " " Or , " the sergeant said , " you may use the telephone to notify your families . There are bail bondsmen three doors down on this street . " " What family , what telephone ? " Olga whispered again . " We have n't got a telephone either , " Hennie said . They had n't needed one , they 'd always thought ; at this moment , with cold alarm running through her veins , she would have given anything for one . Freddy would be coming home from school and there 'd be nobody to let him in . Dan would be in his lab ; one could only hope that Freddy would think of going there . " If we have no telephone , " she began , addressing the sergeant , " is there any way somebody will get in touch with our families ? " " Give Officer McGuire the name and address . We can notify the precinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magistrate at ten tomorrow morning . " A pile of papers , to which he now turned his attention , lay on the high desk before the sergeant . He 'd had enough of these troublesome women  --  a bunch of foreigners , anyway .  | " When they 're finished with their contacts , take them right back , McGuire . " " Back " was a cell at the end of a corridor . Hennie held Olga 's sleeve to make sure they would not be separated . When one cell , holding eight or ten , was filled with strikers , the remaining few went to the next one , which was already partly filled . The iron gate closed and the officer rattled the key , drawing it out with a final click . Final . For a moment , Hennie stood quite still , watching the dark blue uniform march away . Me , in a cell ! Me , Hennie Roth . And farther back , more astonishingly still , Henrietta De Rivera , daughter of Henry and Angelique , granddaughter of She came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cement room , fairly large , without a window . There were cots on one side , each with a pillow and mattress ; she did not have to look twice to see that they were filthy . Around the other three sides ran a narrow bench . Four buckets in the corners revealed by the stench what they were used for . It came to her that this was what they called a " holding cell . " If you did n't get bail , you had to spend the night here . All of this went through her mind in seconds . In the next few seconds , her eyes took in the women on the benches : one prostitute , very young and pretty with a dirty lace-flounced dress ; one old woman with tumbling gray hair , typical of the homeless who t sleep in doorways ; and another of indefinite age , respectably clothed , shabby and trembling . It came to Hennie that this was a scene out of Dickens . The young one was interested in Hennie 's bruises . " Say ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were pickets at the shirtwaist factory . " " You got it easy , then . You 'll be out of this dump in no time . A couple of hours . " " Why is that ? " " Because . The high mucky-mucks'Il get you out . They always get your kind out . " And as Hennie looked perplexed , she explained , " You know , uptown mucky-mucks . Ann Morgan . Mrs. Belmont . Do n't you read the papers ? " Now Hennie understood . It was true : Women whose names appeared on the society pages in vivid accounts of banquets and balls were often the same who marched in the suffrage parades and signed the peace petitions ; too , often those privileged women came to the support of these  | other women who made some of the clothes they wore . Hennie had had to remind Dan more than once of that . " Yes , but it 's late , " Olga said . " Even if they come , it wo n't be before morning . " Looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer at the desk to tell Dan to get bail for you , too , Olga . " She tried to recollect what little she knew about bail . Did n't you have to have some surety ? Four hundred dollars , she thought . Goodness knew , Dan did n't have money like that at home ! They did have more than that in the savings bank , but the bank was closed by this time until tomorrow morning . Again she looked at the cots and shuddered . Olga had sunk onto the bench next to the middle-aged woman , the only one who looked clean . Hennie looked for a space , although she would have preferred to stand , touching no surface in the room ; she had an uncontrollable horror of vermin . Yet it seemed absurd to be standing there alone for what might be many , many hours . She sat down on the other side of the clean little woman , who , after searching her face curiously , struck up a conversation . " Knocked you around a hit , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , " Hennie admitted . Her face had begun to throb badly . " Looks awful . You 'll have a shiner . Maybe two . " " I wish I had a mirror . " " I can tell you . You 've got a bloody lump on your nose , your left cheek is turning green and blue and is swolled up , like you 've got mumps . " " Maybe I could get some ice , " Hennie said doubtfully . The woman laughed . " Who do you think 'll give you that ? Them , out there ? This ai n't no hospital . You 're lucky they do n't punch you another one . " Across from Hennie , the young girl opened her purse . " Here 's a mirror , if you want to look at your mug . " " Maybe I 'd better not , since I ca n't do anything about it . But thanks anyway . " The girl shrugged . Holding the mirror up toward the weak glare of the ceiling bulb , she examined her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . A doll 's face , with dimples . Olga , who had been sitting with her head in her hands , raised it and leaned it against the wall . Her closed eyes lay in dark blue hollows.  | " Are you all right ? " whispered Hennie . Without opening her eyes , Olga whispered back , " Leah . Little Leah . " " She on strike too ? " her neighbor inquired . Hennie answered for Olga . " Yes . She 's not well . " " I see that . I 'm in for lifting . A pair of gloves . They caught me this time . Only the second time , though . " Some of the strikers in the next cell began to sing . Starting low at first , they raised their voices a shade and finally burst out singing : of freedom , of bosses , wars , love , and peace . All that energy , that strength , that spirit ! Hennie felt none of it now ; she was exhausted . The pain in her head was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounding down the hall and made them stop singing . The minutes passed . Two hours must have passed . Her watch had been broken in the scuffle and she could only guess the time . Where was Dan ? Suppose they had n't reached him ? How hard would they try , without a telephone ? . . . He would be frantic . Would he think of looking for her here ? No , of course not . The minutes passed . It was just as well that she did not know the time , for it would have been unbearable to watch it pass . After a while a policeman came and unlocked the grating . Everyone except the poor old derelict , who lay asleep in her woolen rags , started up in hope . But it was only some supper . " Thought you ladies might be wantin ' your evenin ' meal . Here 's a nice lot of bread for yez and a drink of good cold water . " He put the dishes on the end of the bench , where the stench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hennie gagged . " Not to your likin ' , missus ? You were wantin ' turkey , I 'll bet , were you not ? " Hennie , choosing to ignore the sarcasm , was about to ask whether any message had come from her husband , when the young girl let out a frightful screech and scrambled up on the opposite bench , raising her soiled lace ruffles . " A rat ! Oh , Jesus , a rat ! " Her teeth chattered . " He went behind there ? " And she pointed toward one of the slop buckets . The policeman kicked the bucket aside , splashing some of its contents on the floor . There , indeed , was a hole where the wall met the floor . He threw up his hands . " Poor thing , come in out of the cold . Better eat your nice dinner , ladies , before he comes back and eats it for you . "  | Hennie shrank on the bench , drawing her skirts in . For God 's sake , where was Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She waited . Hennie , in a cell . No matter what , even if she had to stay here all night , she must n't panic . Must n't . Would n't . After a long time she became aware that her teeth were clenched and her hands were balled into fists , thrust into her pockets . Surely it must be very late by now . The old woman , rousing from sleep , went to squat on a bucket . Olga had scarcely moved , except to stir a little and patiently sigh . The other two women were silent . Like Hennie , they waited . Surely it must be very late . . . And then she heard Dan 's voice . From far down the corridor it rang . and at the sound of it her first tears came . Roughly , she wiped therm away and was dry-eyed when he appeared . She flung her arms around him . " I thought you would never come . " " Wait till we 're outside and I 'll explain . Paul 's here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your friend . " " Olga , " Hennie cried , " come , dear . This is Dan and it 's all right , you 're free . Come along , we 'll take you home . " " What have they done to you ? " Dan was aghast , and Paul , who was waiting at the street door , opened his eyes in astonishment . " Do I look so awful ? " " Yes . I want to take you to a doctor right away . " " No , please , I want to go home . Nothing 's broken . I need some ice on it . And a hot bath , and some hot tea . Paul , this is my friend , Olga Zaretkin . My nephew , Paul Werner . " Paul bowed . In his velvet-collared overcoat , with his cheerful young face , he might have come from another continent to stand on this grimy street . His sleek little auto was at the curb . He covered the women with a lap robe . " It must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where shall I take you ? " he asked Olga . She murmured , " You go down Grand Street , it 's left around the corner , then you go  --  I 'll show you . " These were the first words Olga had spoken in two hours , Hennie realized . How ill she is , she thought , and there is nothing to be done about it .  | Nothing to be done either for the three left behind in the jail . Each of had been there before , each would be there again ; the horror was erwhelming . " What happened , " Dan explained , " was that when you did n't come me , I went all over looking for you . I thought maybe you 'd gone to settlement , so I went there . I thought maybe you were at a conferce in Freddy 's school . I asked everyone in our building who might ow . I even went to your mother 's ; I took Freddy ? " " My mother knows ? " Hennie cried . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul , who 'd just got ome on his winter break . He picked her up and they both came to our house , just about the time a cop from the precinct arrived to tell me shout you . " Dan reached back from the front seat and grasped Hennie 's hand . " Do n't be afraid about tomorrow . The magistrate will give you a one and a lecture and you 'll go home . Of course , he might not be as lenient a second time . " " This is the house , " Olga said abruptly . They drew up in front of a tenement indistinguishable from the others n the street . The sky , filled with the threat of snow , pressed down on the squat roofs ; the street , with the pushcarts taken in , was dead . " No , wait here , " Hennie instructed Paul and Dan , who were prepared to go inside with the women . " I 'll just see Olga upstairs and be right back . " She would not say in Olga 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prowled , who would take perverted pleasure in damaging Paul 's treasured auto . The sewing machines whirred to a halt the instant they walked into the third-floor flat . Four men and women in gray middle age , and three pale boys , stopped work . Seven pairs of eyes stared . " So what happened to you ? The strike again ? " " Let her sit down , " Hennie said . " She 's about to drop . " Someone moved a pile of woolen pants from a chair . " So , sit . You want some hot tea ? " A woman , evidently the mother of the family , got up . " You look terrible . Frozen . " " I am . " Olga removed her hat . " Frozen . " " She 's a sick woman . " One of the men sighed , and adjusting a seam under the needle , began to work the treadle again . " Very sick . " Olga began to struggle out of her coat . " Keep it on , " Hennie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " But I 'm also burning . Where 's Leah ? " " I sent her for milk , " the woman answered . She brought tea ; Olga warmed her hands around the glass and dran There being no place to sit , Hennie stood . Now she saw that there we two more children , quite young , asleep on another pile of clothes n the window . The light from the kerosene lamps was a sickly yello one 's eyes must hurt , sewing in such light . Often enough Hennie h been in flats like this , yet somehow never seen one as clearly as now . Thr ' stifling air smelled of stale grease and unwashed bodies . I would lose my sanity if I had to live here , she thought . Snow had begun to shower against the window , and Paul was waiting . She was preparing to leave when the hall door opened and a little girl came in , carrying a pail and shaking snow off her coat . " Leah , " said Olga , opening her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure cold into the fetid room , stood staring at her mother . " Mama ! Are you sick again ? " Hennie said quickly , " Mama 's all right . She had to come home , but she 's all right . " " Yes , I 'm all right , " Olga repeated , adding , " do n't worry , Leah , " for the girl 's large eyes had opened wide in alarm . She knelt beside her mother . " Has something happened to you , Mama ? " " I 'll tell you later . We must n't keep my friend waiting , she brought me home . You remember her , my friend Hennie I always talk about ? " Leah looked closely at Hennie . " I remember you . You gave me lemonade once at the settlement house . " Olga looked up at Hennie . Proudly and tenderly the look said , You see , you see . . . She had not exaggerated . Rather , she had not said enough , Hennie thought , for this was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled you toward her , something immediately vibrant and warm . Reddish hair made a tiara of loose curls around her head ; each silky cheek held a dimple . Most striking was her look of health , as if she had come from days of milk and sun on a farm . How long would she keep that radiant look ? The child was studying Hennie in return . " You came in the auto , " she said . " Yes , it 's my nephew 's , " Hennie replied , and felt shame , which was  | urd for , in the first place , the auto was not hers , and in the second , why should Paul not own it ? He had not stolen it , nor harmed yone . All this spun through her mind , repeating a thought that would be with her all her life , wherever there was a juxtaposition of wealth and poverty . he child went to the window to look out . The man working at the window was amused . " Look at her ! She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one like it , , little one ? " Olga shrugged . " Autos ! All I ask is enough food to keep up our ngth and I 'll gladly walk . " Hennie put her hand on Olga 's bent shoulder . " Try to take care of yourself . " Foolish , futile counsel ! " If there 's anything I can do . . . " Olga shook her head . " For me , nothing . Only for Leah . " Her voice as filled with tears . " I know . I promise . " Yes , there was something about Leah Zaretkin , eight years old . One of the golden ones , Hennie thought ; you do n't know how to describe what is , it is just a sort of emanation , a bright glow . Dan has it . Paul has Hennie dozed and woke with a painful throbbing in her nose and jaw , which had been pressed into the pillow . In a chair next to the bed , Dan sat and watched . He had called the doctor from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tray , renewed the icebags , and warmed her with his enormous pride . " I thought maybe you 'd be angry , " she said now . " Angry ? Yes , at the thugs and at the police who are n't much better ? than thugs . I 'm only thankful you 're not hurt worse. ? His eyes glowed with admiration . " You 'll see , though , it will have been worth it . Oh , it wo n't be solved overnight ! The employers will give in a little for the sake of getting work started again , and there 'll be more strikes . But eventually the law will regulate conditions . And it will be your courage that began it . " It started to snow again . Then came sleet , pattering on the window .  | Dan pulled the blankets closer around her shoulders as she slipped back into a half doze . My courage , he says . But I 'm not brave . I was scared to death . I 'm even more scared now when I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do these things ? Because I want to help and I know its right . Of course . Yet there 's something else . . . I think . . . I know it 's that I want to feel important . I want Dan to praise me . He loves me . . . but I want him to praise me too . Suddenly she sprang out of bed into the shock of cold air and went to the mirror over the bureau . " What on earth are you doing , Hennie ? " " I want to see how I look . " Tilted , the lamp threw a sallow beam on her face . Ignoring the swollen side , she analyzed herself . It is only expression that makes my face attractive , she thought , for what might have been the thousandth time ; the features are too bold , too flawed , the eyebrows too thick . When I smile and my mouth curves , I am at my best . I should remember to do that more often . " In a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be truthful , in a couple of weeks you 'll be fine . Does it hurt so much ? " " Not much . " " Come back to bed before you freeze . I do n't know why you do n't fall asleep . The medicine 's supposed to make you sleep . " " It 's because I ca n't get that child out of my mind . If you could have seen that vivid little face , Dan , and that miserable room , all grime and gray ? " " I know , I understand . But there 's nothing you can do , so you really must try to stop thinking about her . " " You see , I sort of promised Olga that I would take care of Leah . " " What ? How can you take care of her ? You should n't have made such a promise ! " " Those people wo n't keep her when her mother dies . How can they ' ' They 're probably feeding her and Olga for nothing now . I 'm sure they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'll tell you what you can do . You can keep in touch , and when it happens , when the mother goes , you can make arrangements at the orphanage . " Those bleak places . Gloomy , dark red brick . Stingy little windows . Regiments , armies of children , walking two by two . Oh , no doubt they were kind enough in those places , after their fashion . . .  | Now came Olga 's despairing face , her shivering hands pulling the collar around her throat , and her despairing cry : What will become of the child ? Can you allow a little girl like her just to go to waste ? Hennie , there are thousands of them . Yes , but I do n't know them all . Hennie , what can you possibly be thinking of ? I am imagining that I am dying and there is no place for Freddy to go in this jungle of a world . Freddy . What will he think ? He has the softest heart . She would n't interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have n't had any more children . If I had a girl , if I had Leah , I would send her to school , dress her up in yellow , in white , in red . I would spoil her in a way I never was . Dan 's warm hand stroked her forehead . " Close your eyes . Try . Let yourself float away . " Hennie 's eyes flew open . " We could adopt her . I do n't mean legally or anything like that , I mean , just take her . " " Here ? Into our family ? " " Why not ? We 've wanted another child and nothing happens . " " It 's late now . Freddy 's almost grown . " " It 's not too late . You would n't say so if I were pregnant . " " Well , but you 're not and it 's a big step . Your heart is wrung , 1 understand . But you 'd better do a lot more thinking . " " I have thought . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want me to do it and I should think you would be the first one to want it , you of all people . " " Ordinarily , yes , but in our case , with Freddy the way he is ? " She cried sharply , " What do you mean , the way he is ? " " Freddy has a long way to go and it may not be easy . " " What can you he saying ? There 's nothing wrong with Freddy . " " He 's complicated . He 's different . You know it as well as I do , Hennie , but we 're afraid to talk about it . " " I 'm not afraid of anything and I do n't know what you 're saying . " If you do n't talk about it . perhaps it will go away . " He 's a sensitive child , of course , I know that , Dan , but does that make him  --  strange ? " " It makes for a more uncertain future , " Dan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her own voice , " You want hint to be like Paul . " And so do you . " I never said that , Hennie . " There was a long pause . " It 's been quite day and I 'm tired out . I 'm going to go see how Paul and your mother doing . " He opened the door . Quiet , considerate voices came from the parlor . " Is Mama furious ? " " Not at all . She surprises me . She has n't said one angry word . " " I would have expected her to blow up . " " Too shocked , I suppose . Paul says the blowup will come next week , after she 's had time to think about it . " Dan hesitated . " I did n't mean to be short with you , Hennie . I only meant it 's a staggering responsibility to take another child , a strange child . Frankly , I do n't want to do it . But if you . . . well , you ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , I am , I am ! " And it seemed to Hennie , as she lay alone waiting for sleep and relief to come , that the child 's face was floating , beckoning so sweetly , so brightly there , in the hazy darkness just beyond the window : I 'm waiting for you , when it 's time , when you 're ready , I 'm waiting . Paul was stretched in Dan 's easy chair in the parlor . An amazing day ! Wait till he told his friends ! Bailing one 's aunt out of jail ! Her friend , that other woman , poor thing , she 'd been frail as a blade of grass . God , it made you sick to see such misery . . . and it was so like Hennie to take the trouble . . . he remembered the family tales of Hennie 's childhood , about how she rescued sick cats and once brought a lost little boy home to her house . She 'd been lucky today , though , and ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while ago in just such a labor brawl as this one . He 'd read about it in the Times . He closed his eyes , feeling half asleep . His grandmother and Freddy were sitting on the sofa talking , or rather , she was talking and Freddy was listening , fascinated , with a bowl of uneaten pudding on his lap . " After the war , " said Angelique , " came the yellow fever epidemic , when my mother died . After that , we came north . " " Tell me about it again . " Angelique was pleased with the boy 's attention . " Well , I remember that cannon crashed all over the city . It was thought that cannon fire  | uld kill the germs . They thought night air was poisonous , too , so the indows were kept shut all night . It was so hot , it was terrible . In the orning , when the windows were opened , you could smell burning tar ; at , too , was supposed to kill germs . " " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeds on these tales , Paul thought . " My mother told the family she was going to die . " Angelique always t straight , but she could make herself still straighter , and did so whener the narration required a show of pride , as now . " From the window of her room , I watched the carts pass , loaded with ... fins , and I remember thinking of being dead , jolted through the treets like that , as my mother soon would be . I remember thinking that he people inside the coffins did n't know , and was glad of that . " We had an old butler , a very old Negro man named Sisyphus ; he ent outside when she died and tacked the funeral notice , a card with a black border , on a tree at the gate in front of the house . It was raining . When he came inside he told me , ' Going to storm bad . Always a storm after the death of an old woman . ' Funny thing , my mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember . " For a moment the grandmother and the boy were silent , each of them musing into some private distance . Then Freddy spoke abruptly . " I wish I 'd lived then . It seems so sort of brave and beautiful , like a story . " Paul felt a surge of anger toward his grandmother and toward Freddy too . Bravery was what Hennie had endured today , in a righteous cause . " No , it was n't , Freddy ! " Paul spoke his mind . " It was a time of great wrong in a narrow-minded , backward place . You can be glad you were n't alive then . " " You were n't there , so you do n't know , " Angelique retorted . " People exaggerate and condemn without knowing . It was a gracious culture . Standards . And we had heroes of the kind you do n't see these days . Certainly not around here , " she said contemptuously , fanning herself with a handkerchief . Paul had no taste for futile argument . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn time back . You know what the best time of anybody 's life is , Freddy ? " " No , when ? " " I 'll tell you : now . Yesterday 's gone and tomorrow has n't come , so now is the only time there is . Right ? "  | " I guess so . " A moody kid , too easily swayed . Paul was irritated and sorry at the same time . " Would you like to visit me at Yale sometime ? You could spend a weekend and see whether you 'd like to go there , too , someday . Maybe study science , the things your father works on . Or music , since you play so well , or economics ; that 's what I 'm going to do . " " My father says I 'm to go to City College . He says the finest minds in the country go there . " " That 's one way I agree with you , Paul , " Angelique said quickly . " Dan has the most ridiculous pseudodemocratic ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college . " Paul frowned . She ought to know better than to criticize the boy 's father in front of the boy . " You know what ? You 've got homework to do . Better go to your room and do it , " Paul said . Freddy got up without protest . An obedient child . It would be better if he were sometimes not so obedient , Paul reflected . When they were alone , his grandmother turned to him . " Well , and what do you think of this mess today ? " And , without waiting for an answer , poured forth her complaint . " I ca n't for the life of me understand it ! My own daughter under arrest ! So different from your mother , you would n't think they were sisters ! This whole household is so foreign to me that I might as well live among Zulus or Hottentots ! " Paul did n't answer . " Surely you do n't approve of what happened today ? " " I understand what she did , " Paul said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have the same conviction or courage , and maybe never will have . " " Nonsense ! You come of a courageous family . You heard what we in the South endured during the war . That 's character . It 's in the blood . Have you forgotten ? " " I have n't forgotten , " Paul said wearily . And he thought of Freddy . What was to become of the boy , pulled as he was in two directions , whipped daily into a socialist fervor by his parents and at the same time set upon  --  and enthralled by  --  his grandmother 's aristocratic , romantic pap ? He got up and walked to the window . Families ! They bred you , fed you , and loved you , and baffled you so that you got to a point where you  | did n't know what to think . Even his own household , which was certainly far less contradictory than this one , was confusing . Already he looked forward to being back at college , not because he was unhappy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among his friends , he could say whatever he thought without offending any sensibilities . He turned back to the room . " The snow 's let up , Grandmother . And if they do n't need us anymore , let 's go . I 'll drive you home . " " Very well . Automobiles make me nervous , but I 'd better get used to them . I 'd better get used to a lot of things , the way it looks . " Had n't we all , Paul thought , but did not say it . " I drew a picture , Mama , " Leah said . " Want to see ? " Out of her skirt pocket came a creased sheet of copybook paper . Carefully she unfolded it , flattened it with her palms , and presented it to her mother . " It 's a princess . Can you tell ? " " Certainly . You 've made such a wonderful crown . Of course , she could even be a queen with that crown , could n't she ? " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the prince . And her dress is pink . I did n't have the right crayon , but it 's sort of pink , anyway . " " It 's lovely . You do make lovely pictures . " The mother sat with her chin in her hands , watching the child eat her meager supper : a slice of dried herring , a boiled potato , and some bread . The child ate , nevertheless , with enjoyment ; she was hungry . Charity fare , the mother thought , a gift from those others who were still at the machines in the front room . Surely they must know there was no possibility of repayment ! It was a gift from the poor to the poorer . " I wish you would make me a pink dress , " Leah said . Olga trembled . Her child 's simple wish , the slight petulance , the direct gaze , all turned a knife in her heart . With what was she to buy cloth ? Or how get the use of a sewing machine , since these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of finding the energy " You 're shivering , Mama ! And it 's hot here in front of the stove . " The kitchen was so small that the table and two chairs were almost flush with the coal stove . Thank heaven the place was at least warm ; the stench of fish and the sight of the greasy sink you could put up with . " I said , you 're shivering , Mama . "  | " I 'm all right . It just takes me a while to get warm sometimes . " The child looked up sharply , as if to make sure that Olga was telling the truth . Then , seemingly satisfied , she turned back to herself . " Will you really make me a pink dress ? " Olga said gently , " It seems to me that I should first try to get you a winter coat . Your wrists are sticking out of your sleeves , you 've grown so . " " I do n't care about that ! I want a dress ! Hannah 's mother made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't you ever ? " Leah clapped her hand to her mouth , then corrected herself . " I forgot you 're sick . When you get better , I mean . " How kind she is , thought Olga . She gives me orders , she demands , and quickly remembering , is kind . Such a little thing , a baby ! " I 'll tell you , Leah darling . Pink is a summer color . It would look foolish now . But when summer comes , I 'll see that you have a pink dress . I promise . " Dear God , somehow , I do n't know how , she 'll have it . " Drink your milk , Leah . You need it . " Even milk was expensive . In Russia , in the poorest village , one could keep a cow . It ate grass that cost nothing and gave you milk in return . Here  --  Olga stared at the window , which looked almost directly into another window a few feet distant  --  here there was n't a blade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the geranium on the windowsill last summer had died for lack of sunlight . Still , that was n't fair . America had villages too , and cows and flowers . But they were far from this place . Her gaze returned to the little girl , who , with both hands on the tumbler , was dawdling and dreaming . " What are you thinking of , Leah , so far away ? " The child smiled , dimpling her cheeks . " I was thinking about that lady , your friend wit ) came in the auto . I wish I could go for a ride in it . This innocent desire for a trivial pleasure , this total ignorance of what was lying ahead , were enough to make one weep . But it was necessary to be quite calm . And Olga replied evenly , " That would be fun for you , I suppose . " " Of course it would ! She must be rich , that lady . Is she rich , Mama ? " " I do n't know . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , that 's all that counts . "  | Leah scraped her plate clean and took it to the sink . She dangled a tour , torn dishrag between two fingers , wrinkling her nose with disgust . " Ugh ! Dirty ! Everything 's dirty in this place , Mama ! " " Shhh , they 'll hear you . " Anxiously , Olga turned toward the front room . They had n't heard ; they were all bent over the machines , working the pedals , talking and humming . " You must n't say such things , Leah . They 're such good people , so good to us . They do n't have time to keep things cleaner , that 's all . " " But our rooms were clean when we lived with Papa , " Leah whispered , persisting . That was true . There 'd been two parents working and only one child ; it had been easier for Olga than for this crowded family . " I miss Papa , " Leah said . " I know . Oh , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The face of the dead young man hovered before the widow 's eyes , and perhaps it rose in the child 's sight also , for she suddenly wailed , " Oh , Mama , he 'll never come back ! " " No . " " What if you die too ? I 'm scared . . . you could die too , could n't you ? " Olga coughed . A fit of coughing strangled and choked her : blood spattered red beads on her handkerchief . " You are very sick , Mama ! I know you are ! " " Yes , I 'm sick . " Olga took resolve ; one might as well face , at eight , what one would have to face at nine . " It 's possible that I could die , Leah , my darling . " " I do n't want you to ! You ca n't ! I 'll have nobody then ! " " It 's not up to me , it 's not like that . Listen to me , listen carefully . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can understand grown-up things . I 'm going to write down the name and address of the nice lady who was here . Hennie Roth . I 'm going to put it in my box , under my clothes . Remember . And  --  if anything happens to me , you 'll go to her . Or somebody here will be kind enough to go to her for you . " " Why ? Why ? " Olga steadied her wavering voice . " Because  --  she promised me to look after you . She 'll take you to live with her , I 'm sure . You 'll have a good home there . "  | Leah plunged upon Olga 's lap . " But I do n't want to live with her ! I do n't want to live with anybody but you ! " Gently Olga held her away . " Do n't come near me , I have to cough again . Darling , they 'll be kind to you . I would n't want you to go with them if I did n't know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table and wept . " Leah . You 'll have dresses . Pink , and any other color you want . " The mother sought words ; there was so little time in which to prepare the child . " Toys , too . Things I ca n't give you . Maybe even a dollhouse . " Out of the muffled , tear-filled mouth came an answer . " I do n't want a dollhouse . " " You do . You 've talked about it ever since you saw that picture in a book . " The little shoulders shook . . Very , very gradually the sobs began to subside . ... presently , Leah looked up , wiping her cheeks with the back of her hand . " And , " Olga said , " they would take you out in an auto now and then , I 'm sure . " She heard herself tempting ; her voice was sugared ; at the same time , it pleaded . " Just as long as you remember you 're a smart girl , Leah . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want , for what 's right . And you 're a good girl , you 'll know what 's right , I 've tried to show you . " The child 's dark , intelligent eyes seemed to comprehend something , anyway . Yet she muttered , " Still , I do n't want to go there . " " Well , we need n't talk about it anymore just now . Take your dress off and I 'll brush your hair . " Warm hair sprang and curled under the mother 's fingers . And Olga , silently , rhythmically brushing that live hair , kept her anguish to herself . How strange it is that other hands will tend her ! When the first grief is over , slowly , slowly , she will become used to those other hands ; the memory of mine will dwindle away ; I will be a recollected face , a voice half forgotten , a name to be honored : Mother . Dead mother . It 's not quite real . Not possible . Death Caine even sooner than might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering is over . They had come directly back from the funeral to collect Leah 's possessions : a few clothes , a shabby doll , some equally worn books , and a  | drawing pad with crayons . Now , in the front room , among the sewing machines that had been deserted that morning so that their owners could follow Olga to the Brooklyn cemetery , they stood in the awkward attitude of people who are in a hurry to separate and are not sure how to do it without being abrupt . Dan and Freddy stood apart in the doorway . Freddy was solemn ; he had been scared ; this was his first contact with death . Hennie had n't wanted to bring him , but Dan had insisted that , at eleven , the boy was old enough to know realities ; besides , since she was determined to invite a stranger into their family , he ought at least to be familiar with the situation from the beginning . Perhaps that did make sense . Anyway , there they stood observing , Freddy obviously very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent . Hennie opened her purse . " Who among you collected the money ? " she inquired . One of the men answered that he had , that they had gotten a group to chip in , since certainly they would n't have allowed the poor woman to go to potter 's field . " I have enough to cover the cost , with some left over for you people here . " It was hard to keep her voice from breaking , and she finished quickly . " You were all so good to her . " The mother of the house grasped Hennie 's free hand . " You 're an angel , " she said . " An angel . " " No , not I. It 's my sister 's money , hers and her husband 's . When they heard about this they wanted to do something . " " You hear , Leah ? " The woman lifted Leah 's chin , revealing the full face , swollen , frightened eyes , chapped cheeks , and wet nose . " You 're going with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you wo n't forget us , will you ? " And before the child could answer , she assured Hennie , " She 's a good girl , wo n't be a trouble to you . And smart , she 's very smart for her age , you wo n't be sorry . In a few years she 'll go to work . Have you got all your things , Leah ? It wo n't do to keep these people waiting . " Hennie understood that they were anxious , having lost half a day , to get back to work . She took Leah 's hand ; it clutched hers tightly in return ; the child knew enough to grasp a lifeline . " Well , then , " she cried , feigning cheer , " well , then , off we go ! " They took the streetcar home . Leah 's worldly goods were in a cardboard box on the floor between Hennie and Dan . Freddy and Leah sat  | across the aisle . Out of the corner of her eye , while Dan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . That dreadful coat , she thought . We 'll go shopping tomorrow afternoon . I must get a pretty bedspread . Lucky that we have the little back room . I can fix it up . Yellow will make it sunny . And a shelf for dolls . We 'll have to give her some dolls . She 'll think she 's in fairyland after that place . Look , now , Freddy is telling her something , making her smile a bit . She must be terrified . But Freddy feels for her already . He understands . He wo n't be jealous , wo n't resent her . Gentle Freddy . I saw his face while she was crying so at the grave . That pathetic funeral , just a small band of strangers in a hurry to get it over with . Cold clods flung into the hole , thud on the coffin . Will she remember that ? And the sparrows noisy in the trees ? They walked home from the trolley stop . The April day , which earlier had been dismal , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky . In Washington Square behind iron railings , pools of white and yellow jonquils rippled in a quick wind . Leah stopped to look . " I never saw so many flowers before , " she whispered , and stood still , gazing . Then came a nursemaid pushing a carriage in which an infant lay surrounded by white frills and taffeta bows . Leah 's eyes were astonished . From side to side went her head as if on a swivel , while wonders passed through the square : two gentlemen wearing striped trousers and silk hats , a barouche with a coachman in maroon livery , a large old lady upon whose head there rested a tower of black ostrich feathers . Wonder upon wonder . How eager she is ! Hennie thought . And strong ; she 'll find her way in this new life before very long . And she urged gently , " Come . We 'll go for a long walk tomorrow . I 'll show you the neighborhood and your new i ! ij school . Right now we need to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all ? " Leah nodded . Of course she was ; she was probably always hungry . " Will you call me Aunt Hennie , dear , and tell me when you 're hungry or whenever you want something ? " The child 's eyes filled again . It is the kindness , Hennie knew at once ; it always brings tears , especially on the sort of day this has been . So she spoke briskly instead . " Go on , you two . It 's getting late . " Leah and Freddy went ahead . The boy chatted .  | " Once you learn checkers , " they heard him say , " maybe I 'll teach you how to play chess . I 'm pretty good at it . " " I do believe he 's happy to have her , " Dan said . " Then do you still think this is a mistake ? " Hennie asked . " Never mind what I think . I have to accept , it 's done . " " Look how the sun glints on her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit that . " " Oh , she 's a charmer all right , and will be . But you 're satisfied , and that 's all I care about , God knows . And I will help you with her , do the best I can . Do n't worry . " Hennie smiled . " I won't. "  | Freddy is in his room after supper , supposedly doing his homework . Twelve math problems await him , and a map on which he is required to outline the major rivers of the world , but he ca n't think of numbers or rivers tonight . He can think only of what he has seen that afternoon . He lays his head on his arm and grieves . It was such a good day in the beginning . Walking to school with Bob Fisher , who has never noticed him before and suddenly seems to like him a little ; having a piece of apple pie in his lunch box ; getting an A-minus on his composition . Finally , and best of all , Mr. Cox asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music teacher is sick . So Freddy runs out of school , not even looking for Bob Fisher to walk home together ; he has to tell Dad about the piano ; he ca n't wait to see Dad 's pleased face . Dad wants him to be a real performer and keeps telling him he could be . He wo n't mind being interrupted at the lab with news like that . He runs all the way with his schoolbag bouncing at his leg . He skids around corners , loses his breath , gets it back , arrives at the door , and rings the bell . Nobody answers . Dad must be there , though ; he almost  | always is in the afternoons . Besides , it 's dull weather and the lights are on . Freddy rings again , harder ; it sounds more like a buzzer than a bell , snarling enough to make you wince . Still no one answers . Maybe Dad 's taking a nap upstairs ? Maybe . . . he could n't have died , like Leah 's mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freddy 's chest and fades as he ridicules himself . Worrywart . Then he remembers that he has a key . Of course ! It 's in his schoolbag , the inside pocket , along with the house key they gave him for emergencies after that time he 'd come from school and not found his mother waiting , the day she 'd been arrested . That was the only time , though . He had n't liked that , did n't want her to get mixed up in nasty things like fights and strikes . He finds the key and unlocks the door . Dad 's not at the benches . Ceiling lights blaze above the papers , the scattered plugs and fuses , all the stuff Freddy does n't comprehend or care about . So Dad 's been there ; he must be upstairs , then . Freddy walks to the back of the building . He 's about to mount the stairs when he hears voices . What makes him stop to listen , instead of going straight up and showing himself ? Something . . . something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter . Whose ? Not his mother 's , he knows . Then Dad 's voice : " You are the funniest , most adorable girl . . . " Freddy is frozen at the foot of the stairs . Dad 's voice : " Oh , stay a while longer , ca n't you ? Come on , we 've only begun . . . A muffled answer . Giggles . Silence . And sounds . Sounds . He thinks he knows what they mean ; he is n't sure , but he 's been told things ; the big boys talk in the bathrooms at school . Maybe he really does know ; yet he does n't want to ; this is his father . His father ! He puts his hands over his ears and stares at the wall . There 's a spiderweb left over from last summer hanging in the corner . However did a spider get in here ? His mind concentrates , while he understands that he is shutting out the moment . Suddenly he picks up his schoolbag and walks , almost runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lets himself out . He drags himself home , feeling sick at his stomach . One thing : He has to keep this to himself . He ca n't tell his father or ask him anything , ever . Ever ! He ca n't say exactly why he feels he ca n't ; he just knows it would be awful . And maybe , after all , there was nothing to it ? Maybe he was imagining things ? No . No.  | The woman , laughing . What right had she to be upstairs in that private room ? Suddenly he is furious at the unknown woman . At home , at supper , his father is no different from the way he is every night , when he comes in and kisses Mama , unfolds his napkin , and starts to talk about whatever is in The New York Times that day . But Freddy can hardly look at him . He lets Leah do the talking ; he often does that anyway , because Leah is jolly and he likes to listen to her . His mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came . She does n't cry anymore , never did cry much , even at first . She 's very brave . Looks forward , Mama says , as we all must , not back . Maybe , though , death does n't hurt as much as betrayal . Leah 's lost her mother , but she has beautiful things to remember about her . Beautiful . Soothing . Not ugly , like today . Freddy raises his head from the desk . I 've lost something , he thinks . My father . Not altogether , of course not . But something I 'll never get back , just the same . He 'd better not ask me to play for him tonight . He 'd better not , that 's all . He sighs and opens the math book .  | It was a raw night in darkest December , Christmas week , and the twenty-third wedding anniversary of Walter and Florence Werner . The house , which was oppressive by day , especially when the day was cheerful out of doors , was warm and bright with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company was enclosed as in a velvet box . The walls , paneled in waxed oak , glowed in the light from half a dozen candelabra . Plum-colored draperies of heavy brocatelle covered the windows ; a plum-colored Oriental rug covered the floor . Under the ruby glitter of a Bohemian glass chandelier , the table , set for twentyfour , flashed with the white light of silver and diamonds . At its head , as soon as the tureen of turtle soup had been removed , Walter Werner began to carve an enormous roast . Two young waitresses went around the table to serve . In silver platters , bowls , decanters , pitchers , and repousse baskets , they bore the food and drink : hothouse asparagus , lobster mousse , creamed oysters , brandied peaches , salads , sauces , pastry rolls , souffles , puddings , cakes and cheeses , grapes and wines . At the foot of the table sat Florence . Hennie had an odd thought : The foot becomes the head because Florence is sitting there . Florence is stately ; Walter , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fair ,  | the ornaments help Florence . Passementerie and nine yards of ivory peau de soie sweep the carpet . Fluted lace is gathered low on her white shoulders , and the diamond star gleams on a satin band around her throat . Florence has authority . She sits erect , looking taller than she is . Mama 's eyes never leave Florence . She is proud of this daughter who has regained what Mama once , so briefly , so gloriously , knew . Hennie , to her own surprise , was enjoying herself . It did n't concern her that she was something of an oddity in this company , a woman " out of step , " who had actually , however briefly , been arrested by the police ! She could even feel a faint amusement because of it . Family was family ; various members might go their various ways and still accept each other . So she ate and drank , observing her sister 's triumph with pleasure . The old secret rivalry between them had long ago eased away ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the respect that only marriage and motherhood can bestow . Apropos of that , it was heartening to see what a few years of married life had done for Alfie and Emily . Never would Hennie forget that somber morning when she had gone with them to City Hall ! It had been , in spite of the love that was palpable between the two , a depressing experience . So many dreary scenes had preceded it ! Such bitter insults spoken , such bridling pride ! Alfie heard it in his home , while Emily heard worse in hers . The two fathers , tied by financial need into their partnership , had arrived at a point where they spoke only what was necessary to each other . Actually they had no reason to be angry at each other , since each had done his utmost to prevent the marriage , to keep his child in the family 's community and faith . Alfie and Emily would not he separated . She had been crying , and looked quite unbridelike in her plain dark suit . Ileruiie , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponging her worried cheeks and her eyelids with cold water . " I ) o I look too awful , Hennie ? " Not at all , dear . Besides , the hat brim shades your face very prettily . " " I did so want a white dress and veil and everything ! I do n't even mind so much not having them , but that my parents would n't come today I could n't have believed ! " The Ilugheses had chosen to be out of town . Henry and Angelique , to their credit , had consented to appear , although Angelique 's expression  | as they stood before the marriage clerk had surely not been one to strike joy into the heart . All in all , it had been a sorry start . Yet here they now sat , having marvelously survived , happy with each other and in the possession of a baby girl , whose arrival had produced between the hostile grandparents a kind of chilly peace . A fragile peace . . . . The world was not going to go out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfie and Emily . Or for the baby either , who would belong ? where would she belong ? For a moment Hennie rested a tender gaze upon her brother and his wife , then slid the gaze down the table toward her own children . Freddy and Leah were far down on the other side , so that she could see them only in three-quarter profile . Freddy seemed to be silent ; he missed no nuance , however , and would make his private comments to her later . Leah 's robust laugh rang ; she was lively as ever ; her face was frank , gay , and bold . After two years , she was completely at home in the household and had become their own daughter  --  or Hennie 's own , anyway . It was a wonder and a blessing that the little girl had been able to recover as she had . Angelique had n't seen it quite that way . " She does n't seem as sad as I expected , a child without a mother , " she had observed critically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope she does n't use Yiddish expressions in front of Freddy . It 's a perversion of German , that 's all it is . " And Hennie had answered , " Well , I do n't know to whom she would speak it , since no one in this house understands it . " " Be that as it may , I still think you are making a terrible mistake . " " Be that as it may , " Hennie had told her mother , " I do not think I am . " Only Dan troubled her still . " Do n't you like the child , Dan ? " " How can one dislike a child ? But she is n't going to be a child forever , " he would answer somewhat doubtfully . So he could still make Hennie feel that she had perhaps been too hasty , not quite sensible in what she had done . Nevertheless , the girl was thriving . Eager to learn , she had quickly put the slum experience behind her ; she did her schoolwork well and filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's what I wanted to be and was n't , Hennie thought . " You 're so quiet , Hennie , " Florence said now .  | The remark was a reminder to be sociable , to play the expected role of dinner guest . " Sorry , " Hennie said , smiling quickly . " Too much food , I guess . " But she went back to observation . Many separate conversations were taking place . The entire family , even to the least important Wemers , were gathered ; poor relatives , fading couples related in second or third degree of cousinship , were always invited to such celebrations because " blood is thicker than water . " The women had trotted out their small garnets and made-over gowns for the rare excitement . Now , gushing to each other , they praised everything , the food , the flowers , and the house , while Walter and the more affluent men talked business , interest rates , bond yields , puts and calls . Dan was absorbed with the partner on his left . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had put him next to a daughter of one of the Werner cousins , a vivacious girl who was evidently having a wonderful time  --  as was Dan . His laugh had a distinctive timbre ; it was the sensual laugh that Hennie recognized . He leaned to the girl , as if they had some very private joke , while she fluttered toward his attention and bloomed , no doubt misreading that intention . If only he would n't do that ! She wished , she wished he would n't ! It meant nothing , but how were other people to know it ? He made himself conspicuous ; he made Hennie conspicuous ; people glanced to see whether she was angry , feeling sorry for her , the little wife , the patient little thing . She could n't very well say to them , although she would have liked to : Mind your business , you need n't feel sorry for me , he really loves me and only me . She must pretend not to notice . To reveal that she did was to weaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she must not let Dan know that she saw or cared . The funny thing was that Dan had n't wanted to come tonight . Of course , he never was enthusiastic about coming to this house anyway , but on this night he had a special reason . They were missing a neighborhood party in their building . It was the kind of gathering in which he was most at home , even if  --  and this was surely a contradiction ! ? there were no attractive women there . " There 's life among those people , " Dan had grumbled . " At your sister 's house , the only head that 's alive is Paul 's . He 's the only one who ever has anything worthwhile to say . " And he added , " The only man in the family I can really talk to , now that Uncle David 's in the home . " Paul was talking quietly to his partner , young Miss Marian , " Mimi , "  | Mayer . Freckled and fair and not quite sixteen , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already self-assured , with a definite elegance . " The Mayers are like family , " Florence always said with a prideful smile , whenever they had to be introduced , forgetting how often she had said it before . They have the simplicity of great wealth , Hennie reflected , or perhaps not so much great as accustomed and well-worn . She wondered , and then was almost certain , that the families had hopes that Paul and Marian , in time , would ? The thought fled . Absurd . One did n't " arrange " marriages in America in the twentieth century . Paul 's thoughts were random . Like Hennie and like Freddy , he was an observer . These dinners , these social games , he often found to be boring , and sometimes , in a way that he could not explain , he even felt a certain sadness in what he saw . For instance , his two grandfathers . . . His mother 's father had little to say ; he seldom did . His unfocused eyes , fixed on the opposite wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth and back again , were somber . He ate as though his mind were not there at all . The Werner grandpa , on the other hand , was the master wherever he went , even here in this house that belonged to his son . It was from him that the bounty flowed and would flow on eventually to Paul . And stirring in his seat , he glanced over at the old man 's bulky chest , across which a series of gold chains were looped ; they could n't all be watch chains , so what were they ? He spoke English with a heavy accent , as though he had arrived in this country just last year ; although he had been here since he was younger than Paul was now , he still kept German as the language of his household . Identified with Germany , he went back there every other year . Paul was sorry that he disliked the man as much as he did . He did n't care much for the Werner grandmother either , any more than he did for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two old women  --  although no one in the family would ever admit it  --  despised each other , the one because the other was a German upstart and the other because the Sephardic snob had no money . The latter was slender and fashionable , while the German put away enormous amounts of food and showed it . Her pink flesh was stuffed into striped black silk , but she would look more comfortable , Paul thought , wearing an apron and rolling strudel dough .  | Still , he thought , they were n't bad people , any of them ; really , he had no right . . . The desserts were being carried in : the walnut cake with mocha icing that was a family tradition on important occasions ; ices with raspberries and strawberries from Long Island 's hothouses ; blue flames spinning on top of a plum pudding . Around and around went the two waitresses , and Paul 's eyes followed them ; deftly and swiftly they moved , wearing the blank expressions of Oriental dancers , although one was Irish and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envious , impressed , resigned , or simply hoping not to drop a plate ? He often thought about the maids who lived beneath this roof , who had come from God knew where and for what reason , and would go on to God knew where . The meal had continued for hours ; the air was too heavy now with the heat of the candles and human bodies . Gardenias , opening in the warmth , began to brown at the tips of their creamy petals . At last Florence stood to signal the end and the party adjourned . Between the double parlors , the sliding doors had been moved back to make one room that extended the depth of the house . In the little bustle of finding seats , Paul came up beside Freddy . " Is it too awful for you ? " he asked . Freddy 's eyes widened with surprise . " Awful ? Why , it 's so beautiful ! You know I always love it here . " At the side of the room , next to the fringed portieres that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet tall , it was hung with silver icicles and crimson balls , and crowned by a gilded cherub . Freddy stood admiring the shimmer . And then fear struck him . He had overheard his mother , before they left home , imploring his father to make no comment about the tree . Last year Dad had said something , and you could see that Aunt Florence had not liked that at all . She had been polite as she always was ? how wonderful to live among people who were always quiet and not so emotional about things  --  but she had been very angry . Freddy had felt it . " You have no religious belief , Dan , you always say so , then why should you care ? " Aunt Florence had answered . He remembered it well . " At least we go regularly to temple services . " " And you do n't see the contradiction ? " his father had asked . " Do n't see the absurdity of what you 're doing ? " " It 's only a symbol of happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merica is on holiday , giving presents , having a good time . Why ould n't we ? It has no other significance for us . " Then his mother had given his father one of her " warning " looks , hich he did not always heed , but that time he had , for which Freddy d been thankful . Usually when his father had something to say , he uld not be stopped . He was like a dog with a bone ; you did n't dare ke it away from him . Of course , they should not have a tree . Even Paul said so , being a far ore thoughtful Jew than his parents were . But the tree was beautifW . How lucky for Paul to live here ! Everything in this house was perfect . " How do you like the new portrait ? " Grandma Angelique asked now . Over the mantel sat Aunt Florence , looking as royal as the Princess of Wales . The ladies gasped . " Oh , lovely ! Do n't you love it , Florence ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not too bad either , I must say , " Florence responded modestly . Leah spoke up . " I saw a lady like you in a magazine . " " You did ? " said Florence , turning kindly to the girl . " Yes , she was wearing a tea gown , somewhere in Europe . France , I think . It certainly was n't Russia . She was drinking from a cup . " The ladies smiled . Hennie 's little protegee was learning fast , though how she knew about tea gowns was a mystery , since most certainly Rennie never wore one ! " Leah is interested in fashion , " Hennie explained . " She has done some very fine sketches too . " Hennie wanted to draw Leah out , to show how far she had come , but the other women had lost interest as they settled themselves around the fireplace . " We are having the entire house electrified , " Florence announced , indicating the gas that flickered in the grate . " They 'll be starting work next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , though , in case the electricity should ever fail . " " And you have a telephone too , " remarked one of the " poor " cousins , sounding wistful . " It would certainly be nice to have one , " complained Angelique , " instead of having to go to the store every time I want to talk to my daughter . I am trying to talk my husband into it . " Old Mrs. Werner told a joke on herself . " Imagine ! When ours was put  | in , I was afraid to use it the first time . I thought something was going to jump out of the wall on me . But , " she added comfortably , " one gets used to modern ways very quickly . " " A time of miracles , " another lady said . " Goodness knows what will come next . They say that we shall all go up in flying machines before long . " " Impossible ! " another cried scornfully . They do n't read the newspapers , Freddy thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the air for almost half an hour , do n't they know that ? And he looked around for Paul , with whom he liked to talk about such things  --  although I should be afraid to fly , he thought again , and remembered that Paul had said he would give anything to do it  --  but Paul had found a chair at the opposite end of the room near the men , and since there was no more room for Freddy there , he was obliged to stay where he was . The women 's talk was dull . But now the conversation turned to something interesting , as it always did when they lowered their voices to whisper and leaned together so that " the boy " would not hear . They were talking about Uncle Alfie and Aunt Emily , just as they had before their baby , Meg , was born . " He could n't possibly have continued any longer in the business . Grandma Angelique sighed . Why was it that whatever she said was trouble , people arguing , one worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their marriage , it 's been dreadful . " Gloom , gloom ! Her mouth lingered dolefully on the word dreadful . Yet , Uncle Alfie and Aunt Emily were sitting together so happily ; you could tell by the way his hand lay over hers on the arm of the chair . " However , it 's an ill wind , as they say . " Grandma Angelique 's tone brightened . " He has always been interested in real estate , you know , and now he has bought , with a couple of partners , of course , a small building near Canal Street . " " Well , " said old Mrs. Werner , " that must have been a sacrifice for his wife . " " Alfie has been very good to her , " said Angelique , biting the words . She grew louder ; she wanted to be heard at the other end of the room where the men were . But they , drinking brandy , paid no attention .  | " Alfie says New York will be bigger than London , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property . " She wants my father to hear , Freddy knew . " Tenements , slum dwellings , " Dan always said , whenever Uncle Alk 's ventures were mentioned . " Your son never went to college , did he ? " asked Mrs. Werner . Freddy knew that Mrs. Werner knew perfectly well that Alfie had not . She was a nasty old woman . Paul said so , and she was his own grandmother . Angelique answered stiffly , " He was never interested in anything but business . He has a head for it . " " You can do a lot worse than have a head for business , " pronounced Walter Werner , who had moved toward the women . " Work hard and do some good on earth , that 's all that counts . " " Yes , work hard , " repeated his father . The men brought up their chairs to form a semicircle . " I myself went to the college of hard knocks , " the old man went on . " My son went to Yale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I first went to the college of hard knocks ! My own father was a peddler , you know . He brought me to this country when I was a child . Yes , he was a peddler . I remember it well . I do not hide it , I am proud of it . " His wife , having heard too much about her husband 's peddler father , and preferring not to be reminded of these origins , interrupted him . " Play something for us , Paul . " Paul laughed . " I do n't play ! I stopped lessons at least ten years ago . " Florence intervened . " We should really hear Freddy play , Mother . He 's the gifted one . " Freddy shrank . His horror of being conspicuous was visible in the eyes that he turned toward his mother . " Yes , " Dan said , " he is gifted , more than he knows or will admit to . Why not play the new Mozart , Freddy ? " Still Freddy 's eyes implored . Was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , had there been lately , something new ? Hennie wondered . Something sullen , even hostile , when he looked at Dan ? Especially when Dan asked him to play ? But why should that be ? Hennie felt impatience ; some time or other life ought to stop being so complicated ! She answered the boy in the wordless language that they spoke between themselves : Play , Freddy , your father wants you to . Your father hates to see you so shy . Play .  | " Do I have to ? " he whispered . " 1 'll tell you what , " Florence proposed . " While Freddy thinks about it , maybe Mimi will play something . A little German song for Grandmother . ' Roslein auf der Heide , ' Mimi ? " And with her fine tact that Hennie so admired , she explained for the benefit of Emily , who knew no German , " It means ' Little Rose in the Meadow . ' " Mimi sat down cheerfully and played the simple piece poorly . The contrast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked into space , avoiding his son . The boy 's delicacy both angered and hurt him .... But Freddy is like me , Hennie thought , remembering herself as a child . A sickening sense of guilt overcame her , although it was foolish to feel guilt over something she could not help . Still , she thought , at fourteen there 's time to change ; in the same moment she knew he would not change , and felt for the boy a soft , shielding love quite different from what she would have felt for him if he had been like Paul . . . like Leah . . . There was applause when Mimi had finished . The girl made a smiling , self-deprecating gesture , as if she were aware of the foolishness of the applause but did n't object to it . " That was lovely , " said Florence . The girl shook her head . " Oh , I am all thumbs , really stupid at the piano . " " Not as stupid as I am , " Paul declared . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , we know all about you , Paul . You were one of the brightest scholars at your school . My nephew goes there now and he told me you left quite a reputation behind you . One of the cousins asked what school it was . Walter Werner answered promptly . " Sachs Collegiate Institute . Very fine , " with emphasis . He turned to Dan . " You should really consider sending Freddy . He 's an unusual boy , one can see that already . His vocabulary is amazing , always has been . " " I would n't send him there if I could afford to , which I ca n't . " Dan was in a " mood . " " I do n't approve of private schools . " There was a moment 's pause , until Florence said agreeably , " Oh , I think you must admit , Dan , even if you do teach in a public school  --  and I 'm all in favor of public education  --  that there still are certain advan-  | ' tages , smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our daughters did so well at Brearley and loved it ? " " To say nothing of the fact , " interrupted Grandmother Werner , " that the right young people meet each other there . The same girls have their coming out at Sherry 's together . They marry each other 's brothers and they go through life together . It 's a beautiful way to live . A community of friends . " The elder Werner smoothed gold chains between finger and thumb . " Yes , friends . Last winter when Randolph Guggenheimer gave his dinner at the Waldorf , I knew every man there . What a spectacle ! Unforgettable . The whole place made into a garden . Tulips and canaries singing in the bushes . What a display ! " " A display indeed , " Dan muttered . Paul snickered . Uncle Dan did n't care what he said . Florence said hurriedly , " But it was nothing compared with some that you read about . The Four Hundred giving that party where the whole ground floor of the hotel was turned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , " she said , prudently lowering her voice , although Emily was still standing on the other side of the room , " that was for the gentiles . We can only read about such things . " " And do n't you find it disgusting , even to read about ? " asked Dan . He came around from behind Hennie ; his eyes were dark and serious . " Oh , " Walter said , " most of those people , after all ? " And Paul mentally finished the sentence : Have earned it fairly , and they do give employment But Dan interrupted , " They have earned it , I know . Just like Horatio Alger . " " Stupid books , " said Paul . " Foisted on me almost as soon as I learned to read . " His father gave mild rebuke . " My son is supercritical . There is a deal of truth in those simple stories , Paul . They would n't be printed or so popular otherwise . " " Oh , there are plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried out , " look at the Hearst newspapers ! " Freddy cringed . He was so ashamed : his father was too urgent  --  he sought the word  --  too emphatic , so that everybody in a room , as in this one now , would turn to look at him . Hennie worried : He 's had too much to drink . His face is bright pink .  | He ca n't drink ; he hardly ever does , and now he 's had wine at dinner and brandy , too , on top of it . And she tried to meet his eyes but could not ; avoiding her appeal , he stood tall above her . He wanted to arouse these men in their black-andwhite clothes , in what he called their penguin suits . He despised their suits and them . " Mark my words , there will have to be a tax on income . It may not be this year , it wo n't be this year , but some year soon , you may be sure of it . " " A tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept is outrageous . Besides , we are already taxed ; men of substance tax themselves voluntarily to give to charity , following their conscience . " " Their conscience ? " Dan repeated . The discussion was now limited to these two men ; the rest had withdrawn . As uneasy , silent spectators , they waited for the outcome of the contest . Alfie 's amiable forehead contracted in a worried scowl , while Emily , at the window , drew the curtain aside and stared out to the empty black street . " Certainly by conscience ! Fortunes are given away every year . My father  --  it is possibly not becoming to say so , but my father must forgive me  --  gives thousands . There 's the Children 's Aid Society and the Foundling Asylum ; there are hospitals , old age homes , settlement houses ? " Walter looked toward Hennie . " Your own wife 's the one to tell you about settlement houses . Ask her . " " I do n't have to ask her . I know , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their donors , is n't that so ? They 're a pittance out of those fortunes . " Dan , standing up , leaned forward , resting his hands on the back of his chair . " There are things in this city , I tell you , that would shock you if you heard they were happening in Calcutta or Borneo ! " Mr. and Mrs. Mayer rose abruptly , making a dual murmur . " Good heavens , we 've quite lost track of the time . . . so late . . . but such a lovely evening . " So they talked their way toward the door , with Florence behind them . Oh , why , thought Hennie , why must he do this ? What he says is true , of course , but not here , not now . " Last month , " Dan said , " it was not in the newspapers , too frightful , I suppose , for the public prints , or perhaps not something that the powers want the public to know . "  | He lowered his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people shifted in their chairs . " Last month a family froze to death ; they had no money to buy coal or wood . Well , that 's hardly news , it happens often enough . This time , though , the mother was ill of pneumonia , and died , and lay dead for a week decaying , while her children , too young or too stunned and frightened to go for help , just lay and waited . It was on the top floor of a halfabandoned building , so no one heard the baby crying . And the baby died . . . and there was evidence that the older children ? " Dan swallowed . " Evidence of cannibalism . . . perhaps I should n't tell you . " The room became completely still , without a rustle , almost without a breath . Then old Mr. Werner raised himself from his great chair and cried out . His fist shook as he raised it . His voice shook . " Indeed you should not ! This is a disgrace ! I 've never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these young people  --  your own son ! It 's disgusting , sir , and I consider it unforgivable ! " " It is only reality , " Dan replied evenly . " It is the world they live in . They might as well know what it is . " " Oh , please , Dan , " Hennie said softly . Florence fluttered . " Has anyone tried this marzipan ? I always have it when Hennie is coming . " She beamed a piteous smile to the room . " Once on Hennie 's birthday , she was six or seven , she ate a whole box of it , stole it out of the pantry , it was so funny . Do n't you remember , Hennie ? " she asked , the smile dying into a wordless plea : Do n't spoil everything ; ca n't someone stop this ? And she began to cry . Angelique put her arm around her daughter . " Do n't , do n't . It 's not worth it . You , " she said . " You , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight bow . " I 'm sorry . It 's hard to be civilized when you see the uncivilized things that I 've seen . These wretched homes , the dispossessed , five thousand this last year alone  --  you ca n't imagine . " " Oh , " Florence said , " we can imagine ! Why do you suppose we give what we do ? Oh , we have always been generous , if not as you say , generous enough . " To Florence , Dan spoke more gently . " Charity 's not the whole answer , anyway . What 's needed is a radical cleanup of the tenements . Men like Jacob Riis and Lawrence Veiller are still fighting , and so am I , in my small way . " " Still ? " said Walter . " In spite of the Tenement House Act ? I should think you 'd all be satisfied now . "  | " Oh , it looked good enough on paper ! But the old-law houses are still standing  --  you know that . Rotting away , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak , closed it , and opened it again . " It would seem to me you 'd do better to use that spare time providing for your son 's future . Charity begins at home . " " My son is fine . He 's fed , clothed , warm , and loved , which is more than can be said for the children who live in the Montgomery Flats , where I went the other day with Veiller . " Paul drew in his breath , released a little gasp , and looked questioningly at his father . This affair was no longer amusing . Walter took off his glasses , wiped them , and replaced them . " What in particular took you there , may I ask ? " " Because the Montgomery is one of the worst in the city . Sure the dumbbell flat 's been outlawed since 1901 , but that thing was built in 1889 ! It should be torn down or blown up . You ought to go look at it , stumble up the dark , broken stairs and breathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , in a cold hall , for six families , when there 's supposed to be one for each flat . Nine dollars a month rent on the first floor , eight on the fifth floor . Rent free to the rats , of course . " Dan breathed hard , as if he had been running . " That 's the sort of place from which we took that child . " He motioned toward Leah . " That beautiful little girl , condemned to filth . " " Very commendable of you . But let 's return to the subject of the Montgomery , which you 've brought up . I happen to know , " Walter said deliberately , " it was built according to current regulations , when the railroad flat was outlawed . It 's a dumbbell flat , built to the letter of the law at that time , and modified since according to the new law . There 's a window now in every room ? " Dan interrupted . " It 's an evil place , Walter , no matter what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which the owners must be perfectly aware . " " The owners are aware of nothing of the sort , " said Walter . His pupils , magnified behind the glasses , were black stones . The Werner cousins got up as a group . There was a general consulting of pocket watches and watches on chains around the ladies ' necks . From the outer hall sounded the flurry of departure : delightful . . . thanks so much . . . oh , my boots . . . started to snow , look at that . . . oh , it wo n't be anything much , just a few flurries . . . delightful . . .  | Walter has cat 's eyes , Hennie thought , when he 's furious . I never noticed . I want to get home , get out of here . When will it end ? The two men still faced each other . " Why , it 's obvious to a child , to anyone who cared to think about it ! The owners do n't give a damn ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , Veiller has looked it all up . They 'll be surprised to see themselves spread over the newspapers when he has made his report to the legislature . We 're not giving up . We want a new tenement act . And I 'm invited to go along to Albany . Well , I did do some of the work , " Dan added , almost boyishly , " so I suppose I 'm entitled to go . " In his enthusiasm , his wrath seemed to have died . " So you are going to Albany to make an example of the Montgomery . Have you any idea who the owners are ? " " Oh , some sort of a group , a holding corporation . Veiller knows more about those things than I do . " " Oh , does he ? Well , I 'll tell you . The major stockholders happen to be my father and some of his friends . We took the property back on default of a mortgage . Have you anything to say about that ? " Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The room was totally silent . " Well , " Dan said . " Well . " And old Mr. Werner repeated , " Well . Yes , well . " " I did n't know , " Dan said . Walter sighed . " I want to believe that . But it does show you what comes of meddling where you do n't belong , does n't it ? " Dan shook his head . " No . I 'm a citizen . I care very much what happens in my city , and I do belong . " " Be that as it may , what do you plan to do in this particular situa-tion ? " " What can I do ? " " I think that 's pretty obvious . You can go to your people and get them to stop whatever has been started . " " Walter . . . that 's impossible . The report is already in the hands of the committee . " " It can be withdrawn . " " Veiller would never do that and I could never ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because . . . it would be dishonest , against the grain . "  | " Not against the grain to see the name of Werner smeared in some muckraker 's journal ? You would do that ? " Dan threw up his hands . " It would not be something I 'd enjoy . You ca n't think it would . " " I do n't know what I can or can not think . All I know is that we have a question here of family , a family to which you happen to belong and to which you owe some loyalty . Talk about principles ! " " Well , if you put it that way  --  should n't principles always , any time , come first , or else they 're not really principles ? " " Sophistry , " Walter said with contempt . " Twisting words . It 's easy to do that and prove any point you want to prove . " " I 'm not twisting . I have never been more straightforward in my life . " " So in your straightforward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead with this disgrace and be damned to us ? " " I did n't say be damned to you ! Do n't put words in my mouth ! I said the affair is already in the hands of the subcommittee in Albany and I ca n't call it back . " Freddy 's lips quivered . Leah was fascinated . Hennie looked for a place to escape , but there was none ; they were trapped . " Ca n't or wo n't ? " Walter demanded furiously . There was a long wait . Hennie heard the blood pounding in her ears . She could not have known that Paul was thinking : Nothing is as simple as people like my father and Uncle Dan see it . Problems are round . Or many-sided . Polygons . What you see depends upon where you stand . " Ca n't call it back or wo n't ? " repeated Walter . And Dan said very quietly , " Maybe some of both . " " You bastard , " Walter replied , also very quietly . No one moved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke it again . " Look at your wife ! Her face is burning ! If she were n't as young and healthy as she is , she would be having a stroke because of what you 're doing . " Florence began to cry again . " Stop it , Florence , " commanded Angelique . " He is n't worth it and never was from the beginning . I knew it from the first moment I laid eyes on him . " Hennie cried out , " Mama ! How can you ? You 've no right to say that ! No matter what 's happening here tonight ! How can you ? "  | Angelique wrung her hands , " Hennie , I 'm sorry , I ca n't help it ! God knows my heart aches for you , and now for Florence and Walter , to have this happen here in their home and on their anniversary , this happy night . Oh , dear God , what next ? " Henry had been so silent in his corner that they had forgotten he was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you ? All of you ? Damn fools ! It 's too much , how much can a man stand ? " His face was dark gray . " I 'm exhausted ! No more , no more ! " 4 " His heart ! Look what you 've done ! Florence , get the brandy ! " Walter was distraught . " Lie back , Father , put your head back . Mama is right , Dan , we 've put up with you , your attitude , your remarks  --  you think we do n't know your opinion of us all these years ? But now to upset this good old man who came here tonight  --  to my home ! for warmth and pleasure , and you  --  oh , get out ! That 's the best thing you can do . Get out now and leave us alone . Now . " " You do n't mean that , Walter , " Hennie cried . " You 're not really telling us to leave your house ! " " Not you , Hennie , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Walter put out his hand , but Dan stepped between Hennie and the hand . " My wife goes with me , as any wife would , and when I go , I 'm not coming back . And neither will you , Hennie . Leah , Freddy , get your coats . " Florence wrung her hands . " Is that true , Hennie ? You will stay away from us all because of him ? " Hennie shut her eyes . Black out the room , her son 's stricken face , Leah 's bewilderment , Dan 's stern mouth . She opened her eyes . " Dan is my husband , " she whispered . " Husband , " Florence repeated , making the word an insult . Dan placed Hennie 's cape around her shoulders and , with his hand on her elbow , urged her toward the door . Walter followed . " If you 'll turn from this course , it wo n't be too late . We can forget what 's been said . I 'm willing . Just turn ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door and gone down the stoop to the street . Hennie wanted to look back ; surely someone would come hurrying to say that what had happened had really not happened ! But humiliation kept her from looking . She had to run to keep up with Dan 's pounding strides .  | In silence , they hurried through the wind toward the avenue to catch the downtown trolley . This rift would never be made up , not with Florence , anyway . Parente were different ; they would come around , but Florence owed allegiance to the Werners , as Hennie did to Dan . When the news came out  --  oh , she 'd read in the papers about these investigations , had seen how the reformer could blacken the names of the most respectable and respected  --  how scandalizing for the Werners , for Florence ! And a wave of purest regret caught in Hennie 's throat . Florence was good , she was a sister . And Paul , she thought . I shall lose him too . You should n't have let this happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they climbed into the trolley . Big wet flakes struck the windows and oozed down the pane , blurring the glow of streetlamps . On 23rd Street green lights flashed in the shape of a i giant pickle , erected by Heinz . Passengers craned to look at the marvel , t h which was somehow comical as well as marvelous . ' , I " Look , " she said softly to Freddy and Leah , who were both silent . I " We 're passing the pickle again . " But neither responded . She met Dan 's troubled eyes ; he , too , had been regarding the boy and girl . " I 'm sorry , Hennie . You 're very angry . " " Yes . . . I do n't know what I am . Just numb , I guess . " " I had too much brandy . " " I thought so . " " I sha n't use it as an excuse , though . I was n't drunk , I never have been , you know that . But those men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they . . . I could n't stand them . They were talking about the Boer War and all the money that was made , and investing in diamonds , while I was thinking about what I 've been seeing and doing with Yeiller , talking to him just this past week . And I was fed up , disgusted and angry . that 's all . " Ile touched Hennie 's cheek with his thick woolen glove . " Hennie ? " " I hear you . " " I thought , these are the same men who wrecked the Hague Conference and who make the wars . Out of their miserable tenements come the Ixwr starvelings to tight in their armies . " " Of course you 're right . But that 's nothing new . You 've been among Walter 's people often enough . And they 're really such small fry anyhow , compared with the Morgan crowd or the oil and steel interests . "  | " That 's so . It was just the way it struck me tonight . " " Tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Albany if you had known who owned the buildings ? " Dan hesitated . " Maybe I would have been tempted to for your family 's sake . I do n't know . But if you had seen that place  --  I know you 've seen plenty , but this was the very worst . Such filth , not fit for animals , and , of course , I always think of fire . " He stood in the poisonous smoke on the ledge under the roof while the crowd stared up and waited . hardly believing what they saw . No one else , surely no one in that house tonight , has so much heart . " If it were n't for my teaching salary , Freddy might be living in a place like that , " Dan said . " I know . " They got down from the trolley and began to walk through the swirling snow . It beat at their cold faces and stuck to their lashes . Dan shortened his steps . " I 'm walking too fast . When you were little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can you remember that far back , Freddy ? " Yes , Freddy remembered . He remembered everything and would remember tonight too . He thought : Dad 's trying to make amends . And he thought , I shall never see Paul , now that they have fought . Then he corrected himself : No , Paul will find a way , he always knows how . Just behind him he felt the presence of his parents as one presence : Mother-Father . One . His mother loved his father ; she had been angry at him tonight , and yet now they were walking close together , with their shoulders touching . When he was little , this had angered him , so that he had wished he had no father and there would be just two of them in the house , his mother and he . But that was a long time ago . He wondered about girls , whether they wished their mothers away , and thought of asking Leah , but realized it would be too cruel to ask her . So this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If only Dad were n't so loud and frightening . Now he heard his father 's voice , very low above the sound of slushing feet . " Not so angry anymore , Hennie ? " And his mother 's soft answer . " I 'm sad . I never can be angry with you very long , Dan . You know I ca n't . " And he heard a swift little sound like kissing , but did n't turn around to see .  | The mills of the gods grind slowly , and seldom more slowly than in a democratic legislature . They do , though , grind to a finish , more or less : In this case , less . After long , tedious , and acrimonious hearings before investigating committees , nothing was produced in the way of new laws , only a reaffirmation of the need to enforce the existing one . Owners were castigated for flouting the regulations ; as always , outrage and shock were expressed at the wretchedness of the poor in the richest city in the world , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper headlines were not as flaming as the coverage of a murder , they were yet flamboyant enough to bring misery into the prominent and respectable homes of people who had never seen their family name in print except to announce a marriage or a death .

EPIDEMICS . . . MILLIONS MADE OUT OF HUMAN SUFFERING ran the headings . In  | more sober articles , the culprits were examined and named : builders and mortgage houses such as Southerland , Van Waters , Werner . In her white-and-yellow upstairs sitting room , where Florence , with a sick headache , lay on the recamier sofa , the Sunday paper , which had brought on the headache , was scattered on the floor . The family had gathered to commiserate . Angelique had come hastening ; Alfie and Emily had walked the few blocks from their apartment in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida . " Walter sighed . " They 'll have the New York papers , of course , but somehow I think distance softens the blow . " Alfie assured him cheerfully , " By the time they get back in March , all this will be yesterday 's news . There 'll be somebody else to pick on . " Angelique 's white hands trembled from her jet necklace to the black silk folds of her mourning skirt . " Yes , Florence , I 'm thankful your father did n't live to see the end of this . What he did see was enough ! His two daughters estranged and now this , visited on poor Walter . " " What must people think ? " Florence moaned . " Pull yourself together , Florence , " Walter rebuked , and pulled himself together . " The people we know will hardly believe a handful of sensational muckrakers . Criminal negligence ! ' " he scoffed . " They should try owning one of those buildings ! You put in shelves  --  they knock them down for kindling wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pipes ? They rip them out to sell at the junk shop . These people come from hovels in Sicily , Russia , County Clare , God only knows where . It will take a century to educate them . I know one thing , though , I 'm through . No more mortgages ; I 'm a banker , not in the real estate business . " Paul surveyed the little group . He had been summoned in on his way back to his room after an afternoon at the skating rink . This was another world . At Aunt Hennie 's , the talk yesterday had been triumphant , although Uncle Dan said the law was only a partial victory . " All these existing buildings should be torn down , " he had said , " but of course that could never happen , there 's too much money at risk . " " I suppose , " Florence remarked now , " there 's great rejoicing in my sister 's house . They think they have defeated us , humiliated my husband and me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I do n't want to make any more trouble than there is already . Mama , I know you have to see  | Hennie , she 's your daughter .

" " No , I know I have n't been very effective . Though I certainly wish you could all somehow get together . " " Yes , get together , " echoed Emily . The world 's too lovely for Alfie , Paul thought , too filled with good things , fine houses and jovial dinners , to be troubled by argument , disturbing one 's peace , one 's Sunday nap , or even the energy that one must ! save to get ahead . " Not your fault ! This cleavage is too deep , " Florence declared . " And now , after this  --  it 's permanent , I assure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Paul . Neither your father nor I have made an issue of this or tried to forbid you , but how can you keep going to that house ? We know you go there pretty often , do n't think we do n't . " " I have n't tried to hide it . " " But is n't it time to take a stand for who you are ? You 're a grown man ! " Her tone was plaintive , much closer to a wail than to a scolding . " To go there and listen to them talk about your own parents  --  I do n't understand it . " " They have never said one word , not one word , about anyone in this house , Mother . I would n't go there if they did . They never talk about people , anyway . That 's not what they talk about . " Walter was curious . " As long as the subject has been brought up , what do they talk about ? " Paul shrugged . " How can I answer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to Lake Mohonk every summer to the annual conference . She met Baroness von Suttner , after she won the Nobel Peace Prize . And Uncle Dan , well . . . " Paul stifled a mischievous smile . " He talks about electromagnetic waves in space . " They would n't understand any more than he , Paul , did . " He says someday we will be able to get signals from other planets . In the meantime , he 's got ideas for communication at sea . " Angelique rolled her eyes . " Typical ! " " I do n't know , Mama , " Alfie said earnestly . " You never know . He might have something there . Look at Edison . " Angelique reached out and patted her son 's hand . " You 're like your father , always making excuses for people . Never mind , it 's a kind trait .  | And at least you 're a practical man , providing for your little Margaretta . " Angelique liked the sonorousness of the full name , " Margaretta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in a near-slum , as poor Freddy must . " " Oh , yes , I do feel sorry for Freddy , " Florence agreed , " I always have . He seems so ? " She sought the word . " So  --  remote . And then at other times overemotional . Of course , I have n't seen him in so long . Has he changed much , Paul ? " " He 's grown , " Paul said dryly . " Well , goodness , I know that ! The boy 's sixteen , is n't he ? I meant ? " Here she was interrupted by the entrance of a maid with a tray , which was set down on the table next to the sofa . Sandwiches , cakes , coffee , tea , and chocolate diverted them from the subject . " Have some , Paul , " his grandmother said . " You must be hungry after an afternoon on the ice . " He took a plate . He would have liked to get away alone , but they would have considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not quite true that they never talked about people at Aunt Hennie 's house . She always asked what his mother was doing , not , he knew , out of any sly curiosity , but with regret . And he recalled the two sisters at Grandpa 's funeral , sitting far apart in the temple , not speaking , and surely feeling the wounds of not being able to speak . He wondered again what it was that made people of the same flesh , born and reared under one roof , so different from each other . Freddy , for instance , born of his parents , was and would be different from either one . So much was troubling that had not been before . What most disturbed him was that  --  as his mother had just said , although with different meaning and intent  --  he was now of an age when he must know himself . Often he thought of that old , old man Uncle David , now slipping gradually into senility in a nursing home . He had never spoken to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man 's life , but somehow he had the idea that Uncle David , of all people , might have told him who he was and who he might become . Uncle Dan was far too extreme , too passionate about his causes and his new world . There was a point beyond which he could not go with Uncle Dan . He knew that Uncle Dan thought men such as his father were evil men , and yet he knew that his father was not an evil man . Well he remembered the committees meeting long past midnight ; after the terrible pogrom in Kishinev , for instance , how Walter Werner had  | labored ! Organizing , raising funds , giving thousands , arguing and pleading , he had exhausted himself . Had not Jacob Schiff , the wise , shrewd mediator , the compassionate philanthropist , bestowed on him the warmest praise ? And Baron de Hirsch , the greatest of Jewish benefactors , and Harkness , who was not Jewish , and No , his father was simply a rigid man who saw what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regime in which people like the Werners lived  --  as being troublemakers , destroyers of a decent and improving order . Moreover , there was truth in that . You did n't have to damn a manufacturer just because he ought to treat his employees more generously . One ought to educate instead . In his father 's office Paul had learned how wealth , well used , can build a city ; the great towers , rising all over Manhattan , came not out of thin air or out of Uncle Dan 's theories ; they came from wealth , risk capital , and the results of risk were tangible . Finished at Yale , and now almost finished with graduate school , Paul would probably spend a year at the London School of Economics , get some international experience , and finally settle into the New York office . He was n't sure how he felt about it all . But everyone said that his doubts would sort themselves out ; with broader knowledge he 'd see his way . He hoped they were right . He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker . Certainly he liked everything to be planned ; he would like to know right now what awaited him , whether good or bad . He would like to know for others ' sakes too . Freddy 's future was on his mind , for one thing . It was quite true , as had often been said , that Freddy was his little brother ; he would like to do " something " for him . Money had always been scarce in the Roth household , and was now , if anything , more scarce since they had Leah to clothe and care for ; he could n't imagine his own parents taking a strange child in like that . Anyway , he had often discussed with Uncle Dan where Freddy would go to college . Uncle Dan insisted he would go to City College : " At Twenty-third on Lexington Avenue , where I went ; it costs nothing , and he can walk to it ; some of the best brains in the country have come from there . " Paul had conceded that that was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change of scene , a new experience out of the city , might be a fine thing too ? Paul wanted to pay for it . No , not with his parents ' money , for heaven 's sake ! With Paul 's own , inherited and received when  | he reached twenty-one . It was his and he could spend it as he liked . But Uncle Dan still said no . What stubborn pride ! He would n't even accept the gift of a good piano , which Freddy wanted so badly . Sometimes Paul wondered how Aunt Hennie put up with him . Still , that was n't fair . A man 's entitled to a fault or two . And anyway , Aunt Hennie was crazy about Dan . She looked at him sometimes the way he 'd never seen his mother and father look at each other . It was even embarrassing . He supposed if there was such a thing as a perfect marriage , theirs must be . Still , the whole man-woman thing was a puzzle . To begin with , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones whom in his private mental shorthand he always saw as " white , " probably because their dresses at summer parties at the shore were airy . You held these girls loosely when dancing , having been taught that sweaty hands left stains , and so you barely touched their warm skin under the cool silk . The tops of their heads beneath your chin smelled clean and faintly sweet , like talcum powder . You were careful of your speech with those girls . There was a mystery about them , even about Mimi Mayer , whom he had known forever , almost as well as a man might know a sister . And yet he did n't know her . A distance was kept . Then there were the Others ; in his mind , they stood written with a capital O. These were the town girls , waitresses for whom you hung about with your friends , laughing to cover your heart 's pounding ; after they finished work at midnight , you took them to the beach behind the rocks . Common girls , his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so too ; he wondered whether his father had done what he did with them . Well , they were loud , and their speech , the words they used when you were naked , were not exactly ? And yet they were so sweet , alive and sweet and lovely in the soft summer night . He wondered whether everything in life was like that , with two opposing ways for everything . But most people seemed so certain of themselves ! His parents in their straight , deep-cut groove ; Grandmother Angelique , who was still living in the Confederacy ; Aunt Emily , for whom the pleasant rituals of a calm life satisfied all ; Uncle Dan , who was perpetually angry at the world and knew without a doubt that he was justified ; Aunt Hennie , doing her good works  --  all so certain . Perhaps in a few years I will be certain , too , he told himself , knowing at the same time that it would not be so , that he would always be  | divided . It was as if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking or trying to walk with one foot on each road . Then , being young and hungry after all , he held out his plate for his mother to fill with little sandwiches and little pink cakes .  | In the very last row of the hall , concealed from the podium by the dimness behind a pillar , Dan wore a look of total concentration . Concentration ? He was enthralled . " Once it was possible to have short wars , quick , gallant victories for individual heroes . A sort of contest of athletic skills , though bloodier ! But now  --  now , because of all the marvelous new machinery we have invented , because the great powers are so rich , wars will be very long . " The voice dropped softly into a sigh , almost a whisper , distinct in the absolute stillness that , during the last half hour , no cough or shuffle or creak of chair had disturbed . " And unlike those ancient contests , war now spares no home , no woman or child . Here in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century behind us , we saw what rampaging armies could do . You know about Sherman burning his way through Georgia . My own parents suffered in Louisiana ; it is all as real to me as though I had lived it myself . " Here the hands clasped high ; a surprising dazzle shot from the speck of a diamond in Dan 's mother 's ring . The pretty gesture was typical : Look , Dan , such lovely eyes ! when the boy was born , or Listen , someone 's  | playing the violin in that house , or on seeing a ragged old man poke in a trash can , My God , how terrible ! He felt a lump in his throat , watching her . He had actually sneaked into the meeting ; this was her first big speech and , very nervous about it , she had made him promise not to come . " I 'll meet your eyes , " she 'd told him , " and forget what I was going to say for wondering how well I 'm doing  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do well and I 'm invited again , then you can come . " He had n't been able to keep the promise and was glad that he had n't . So far he had recognized , had expected to recognize , his own words and ideas . Not that there was really anything to call his own . There was hardly anything original to be said at this point about war and peace . It was now merely a question of pounding away at one meeting after the other , of forceful reiteration to arouse , one hoped , an ever-widening public . But his ears pricked up . " I recommend to you a book by a Polish businessman  --  a Polish Jewish businessman , I should say ; Ivan Bloch is his name . It 's a remarkable book . It 's said that the Czar called the 1899 disarmament conference as a result of reading that book . " She 's read that ! She never told me ! I have n't read it myself , I 've been meaning to . . . . Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about modern armaments , but he makes it understandable . Firepower is now so devastating that men will burrow into the very earth to escape it ! There will be a long , long stalemate . And slaughter beyond imagining . Nations will lose their best young men by the millions . Not thousands anymore . Millions , " Hennie repeated with awe . " It will be the suicide of nations . " Again the clasped hands rose ; above them the face glowed , the beautiful eyes were enlarged and passionate . If any single word could describe her , he thought , it might best be genuine . Never had there been anything calculated , spurious , or fake , neither in mind nor in body , about Hennie . And while she went on to tell of submarine-torpedo boats and explosive-bearing balloons , his mind went drifting . . . . Women he had known : How different they were from her ! Women one encountered here and there and everywhere , blended in a way suddenly here now blurred into color , pink and white and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , lovely , dull , self-centered , ordinary  --  None like  | hers . Not one of them . And now , even as with pride and delight he listened to her eloquence , he thought of the night to come . " It is always said that we need these enormous armaments for secure defense ; the fact is that their existence only breeds more armaments on the other side . It is a dangerous game we 're playing , with our alliances and balances and preparations for wars that nobody can win . The Boer War was larger than the Spanish-American , the Russo-Japanese was larger than the Boer . . . . With all this in mind , men and women must speak out to their governments everywhere . It can be done . If we will it , we can . " A kind of music came from her voice . The greatest music is earnest , lofty , and hopeful , he thought , and his eyes filled . Recognizing the rise to a peroration , Dan got up swiftly before he could be observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known you were there it would have been awful , " Hennie said . She was sitting up in bed laughing , enjoying her triumph and his praise . " What are you staring at , Dan ? You look so solemn . " " Not solemn . Just looking at you . Asking myself how this happened . You and me , I mean . I am so lucky , Hennie . Sometimes I ca n't believe it . Her laugh died . She put her hand on his cheek . " Believe it . " " When you stood there today with all those people listening to you , I was so proud , I ca n't tell you how proud . And I thought , She 's mine , with that bright mind of hers , and all the rest . Oh , Hennie ! Do you have to wear that thing ? " " This thing ' is my Paris nightgown , the last present Florence gave me . I 'd better hold on to it , since there wo n't be any more . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can take it off now too . I 'll just get up and lock our door . "  | Hennie had an excellent memory for times and places , and so she was quite certain that it was at Alfie 's country house , on an unusually mild afternoon of a weekend in early spring , when Alfie first asked Dan about his vacuum tube . They were sitting on the terrace , from which height , above a bank of laurels not yet in bloom , they could just glimpse the four young people , Mimi Mayer and Paul , Leah and Freddy , playing tennis . " A real family place , " Alfie said , " that 's what I wanted . " A smile of genuine pleasure spread over his face , which was beginning to show chubby folds under the chin . " A place for all of you to visit and enjoy with us . Plenty of room for all . " Once it had been the Werners ' , but now this would be the house at which the family would assemble : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Florence would not be  --  aunts and uncles , everyone to the farthest twigs on the family tree , would come here to Laurel Ifill . Not an original name , " conceded Alfie , " but there really are dozens of laurels and you have to admit the name has dignity . " The place itself had dignity ; it was a gentleman 's farm , in contrast to the arrogant stone piles that the moguls of steel and sugar and coal were  | scattering around the gentle New Jersey hills . But any impulse toward such grandiosity , even on the comparatively minor scale Alfie could have afforded , would have been thoroughly quelled by his wife . Emily despised whatever was " nouveau . " And Alfie had quickly learned what was " nouveau . " Square and white , then , with green shutters and many chimneys , stood Alfie 's house . An American flag flew from the pole on the side lawn ; every morning Alfie raised it and at every sundown he lowered it . Ample fields ran to a background of sumac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods , dark with maple , oak , and ash , a wildness that could induce a shiver of delightful menace when night fell , so that one could immediately lose three centuries and there , at the fold of the hill , behold an Indian encampment with smoke twisting from the wigwams . A Hiawatha atmosphere . " This was all farms here in the eighteenth century , " Alfie liked to explain . " It 's said that Washington 's army bivouacked down the road on the way to Trenton . Maybe it 's true . The last owners had it in the family for sixty years . A local doctor . He made a few changes , the porch and the porte cochere . " And the iron deer on the front lawn , Hennie added mentally . A homely touch , naive and just right . Alfie said mischievously , " I know you would have liked me to build something like Beau Jardin , Mama . " " Alfie ! Do n't you think I know you ca n't reproduce an antebellum plantation in New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a veranda and columns . It 's so pleasant to have a veranda , and with these lovely views ? " Alfie laughed . " Mama , you 'd have liked me to hire someone like Richard Morris Hunt to do a Vanderbilt house with limestone balconies and turrets , or maybe McKim , Mead and White to do a Newport cottage with a hundred rooms . " And as Angelique started to protest , " Oh , do n't mind me , I 'm only teasing . " " Well , you 've done wonders . For a man still in his thirties to have accomplished all this ! " Angelique spread her arms . " I must say it was very , very smart of you to invest in Kodak . And I want to tell you I have utter confidence in you . Everything you touch turns to gold . " Alfie was embarrassed . " You give me too much credit . The Kodak idea was Walter 's . " Then , turning to Dan , he said earnestly , " I know , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | " And how he feels about me , " Dan retorted . " Yes , it 's a pity . Do n't think Emily and I have n't tried our best . I do n't have to tell you . " " No , " said Dan . " Well , all I wanted to say was ? " And Alfie looked puzzled , as if he had forgotten what he wanted to say . Emily came to his aid . " What you wanted to say was just that Walter has been helpful to you with advice more than once and that you 're grateful . " " Yes , that 's what I meant . You know , Dan , it 's not as if I did n't see quite clearly that Walter can sometimes be , oh , the way he talks , you know . How shall I say it ? What 's the word ? " " Pontificates ? " suggested Dan . " Well , yes , perhaps so . But then we all have our small annoying ways . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get to the point , Alfie . What are you trying to tell me ? " Alfie leaned forward . " All right , it 's this . Walter knows some people , that is , there 's a group that 's bought a small company that makes electrical devices . Do n't ask me what they are , because I have n't the faintest understanding of those things , but these men are experts . They know what they 're doing and I thought ? " He fastened his gaze on Dan 's eyes . " You 've got all these inventions you 're always working on . Paul was telling me you 've added a room to your lab , is that so ? " " Yes , I needed more space to spread out . " " Making progress , are you ? " " Some . " Dan was irritated . As if you could count " progress " like counting the number of bricks that had been laid in a day , when anyone who had the least conception of scientific research knew that for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps diverted to a completely different avenue . " Paul mentioned a vacuum tube among other things , but he was n't very good at explaining it . It 's not his field either . He said you felt you were on to something , that you were excited about it . " Dan shrugged . " Paul exaggerated . I 'm not excited because I do n't know how it will turn out . " He moved restlessly on the chair . And his eyes , grown wider , belied his denial . " The question is amplification , you see , and with a three-electrode vacuum tube , you can produce an effect  | ? " He stopped short . " Wait a minute ! You surely have n't got any damn fool idea of connecting me with some project of Werner 's , have you ? " Alfie cried out in alarm . " Nothing of the sort , Dan . How can you think I would do that ? " " You mentioned him just now . " " No project of Walter 's . Only some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through him . Quite casually , I assure you . A chance remark . And it started me thinking . You know how I like to make connections . And I hope you know I would n't put you in an awkward position , Dan . " Alfie was reproachful . " I know you mean well , Alfie . I know that . " Alfie returned to the subject . " Well , as I said , this is a group with some money and a lot of vision . We 're well into the electrical age , all sorts of possibilities are opening up and they want to get in early , get in touch with idea men like you , buy up patents and hold them , waiting for developments . That sort of thing . " Dan said quietly , " I 'm a loner , Alfie . Not that I do n't appreciate your good intentions , but I do n't work well with other people . I just do n't . " " But you would n't have to work with anybody ! You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing . Just patent your inventions , your tube , for instance , turn it over to these people  --  with every legal safeguard , naturally . If something comes of it , if they can develop a use for anything of yours or they sell it , you 'll get your share . If nothing comes of it , you 'd be none the worse off . " Alfie wanted to see everyone " set , " as he called it . As a result of his generosity , Angelique , since her widowhood , had been occupying a small , sunny apartment uptown near Central Park West . He had hired a maid for her , a motherly Polish girl , who took care of her as though she were helpless , baking hot breads for her breakfast , and ministering to her headaches . Alfie was a dispenser of good things . " And certainly I could get you a goodwill payment at the start . I would insist on that . Five or six thousand , I 'm sure . " " I should n't think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You never know . I 'll bet I could get you the five thousand , enough to buy a nice house . " " I do n't want a house . We 're comfortable where we are . " Still , Alfie persisted . " Well , you need n't buy a house . Just take the five thousand . It 's not to be sneezed at , is it ? "  | For a moment , Dan made no reply . He examined the backs of his hands , turned them over and smoothed the palms . Then he looked up . " Alfie , some things are hard to explain . You remember your Uncle David ? I do n't know whether you know , but long before he began to go downhill , long before he went to the home , he told me a lot of things about himself . Did you know he once perfected a bandage and a wound disinfectant ? He never made a cent out of either one . He did n't want to . He gave them away . Some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think he was , and I do n't either . What I 'm trying to say is , if anything good results from my fooling around in that lab of mine , if it 's something that will make living easier or cleaner and safer , why , I 'll give it away . I have enough . I have everything I need . " There was a silence . No one looked at anyone else . Then Alfie stood up . " All right , Dan . No harm done . I just thought I 'd mention it . If you ever change your mind , let me know . " He does n't understand , none of them does , Hennie thought . Dan might as well have been speaking in Turkish or Chinese . Dan had not been enthusiastic about this weekend ; he hated being drawn away from his projects in the only really free days he had . But Hennie was glad to have come . Reared in the city , she often felt drawn toward country things : the faint green light of reviving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , awakened by the unexpected warmth of this mid-April . On the other side of the dirt road , at the far end of a chocolate-colored field , a man and a horse could be seen moving slowly and steadily , plowing back and forth in a drowsy rhythm . She settled back , leaning on a rock ledge , to watch in the other direction . The ball made its low arc across the net ; ping and thwack went the long volleys , as regular as a metronome . They played well . The girls ran gracefully . holding their skirts above their shoe tips with the left hand . It was remarkable how quickly Leah had learned . She learned everything quickly . At fifteen , she was as tall as Hennie . She was lively and , Hennie often told her , curious as a monkey . There was even something monkeylike in her snub-nosed face with its round , busy eyes ; yet it had a joyousness that made people look again and brought involuntary smiles to their own faces . " Good shot , Leah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice on the other side of the net . A  | pleasant girl , Mimi , in a quiet way . Everything about her was quiet and of the best , from the crisp cut of her snow-white tennis dress to her spoken French and her manners . She was without hauteur , which was more than could be said of many young women brought up as she had been . Yes , a pleasant young woman . Yet Hennie could not seem to get near to her . Perhaps when Paul and she were married it would be different . It was plain to see that they would be married . It was a natural evolution ; one had long seen it approaching . Mimi was , by now , almost a member of the Werner family . Now they were crossing the court to change sides , Freddy and Leah against Mimi and Paul . You saw a resemblance and a unity in Mimi and Paul ; erect and purposeful , they displayed what an older generation , what snobs , called " breeding . " What was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And yet there was something . It was as if they knew they would be winners , and not just in tennis . Wistfully , she thought of Florence , who had been born a winner . So long since she had seen Flor-ence People like Leah and Freddy had to make an effort . Leah knew that already and did , but very likely Freddy was n't even aware of it . Freddy , the innocent . He walked a few steps behind Leah , who was eager ; Freddy was already tired of the game , Hennie saw , not physically tired so much as wanting to do something else , to read or play the piano or perhaps do nothing . But he would be forced to continue because of the others ; in that way they were good for him ; Paul was and always had been ; now Leah was too . " Rennie ! You look half asleep ! " Angelique 's voice rang behind her . " I 've been taking a walk with Emily and Margaretta , such a darling child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it . You ought to have been with us , getting some exercise . Why else come to the country ? " Angelique 's tone managed to command and criticize at the same time . " This is the way I like to feel the spring , " Hennie replied patiently . " One gets so little of it in New York . " " If you lived near the park , you 'd get all you want . I walk there every day . Florence and I often meet at the Sheep Meadow or the lake . But , of course , you ca n't , in your part of the city . " If your husband could provide better . you could . To that , Hennie made no reply . So many of their conversations were  | like this , a kind of fencing , dodging , and thrusting without ever making a connection . It had been a good thing when Angelique moved uptown . Hennie 's thoughts ran : I know you look down on my husband because he is n't what you call successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this her mother would surely reply : That 's an absurd comparison . Your father gave four years of his youth to a war that we lost . He was thirty years old when he came home to the ruin that was left , and then had to go up North to start all over . A cruel discouragement . But Hennie was beyond anger . This talk of money was contemptible , not to be heeded . Strange that it never bothered her to hear it from Alfie . Still , Alfie never made oblique references to Dan . Alfie 's need for acquisition was simply like a child 's in a toy shop . He made no excuses , and while you did not approve , you did not resent him either . He was so affable , with his explosive sputtering laugh , so pleased with his comforts , his gifts and hospitality , that you could almost share his pleasure with him . Hennie moved over . " Sit down , Mama , the rock 's quite comfortable . " " No . I 'll soil my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the quivering light . She looks patrician , Hennie ought , glancing up ; her mother 's chin line , still firm , made a sharp angle ; she held her head high , almost in disdain , Hennie thought , and giggled . Angelique asked suspiciously , " What are you laughing about ? " " Nothing . I 'm only enjoying their game . " Angelique looked back at the court . " They do go well together , " she said . Hennie almost asked who . It would have been a stupid question . " Yes , they do . " Angelique smiled slightly . And Hennie , having so often beheld that faraway smile , wondered whether her mother was really seeing the young people on the tennis court below , or seeing Beau Jardin , with the Mississippi curving , in place of the lane to Alfie 's new barn . A foolish woman . Dan says of her , who has lived past her time . She means no harm . It is only that her world has died and she has lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want her to wait until she 's of age , 1 think . Nothing 's actually been promised on either side , but if you ask me , it 's been a foregone conclusion ever since Paul finished graduate school . An excellent match for both of them too . "  | There came another cry from the court , this time from Paul . " Beautiful shot ! " He waved his racket in salute . " Beautiful , Leah ! " Hennie glanced at her mother , saying silently , " Do you see ? " And was annoyed with herself for always seeming to plead for Leah . " You spoil that girl , " Angelique said . " Perhaps I do . " What if 1 do ? I do for her what was not done for me . I want her to feel she is wonderful . " As a matter of fact , " Hennie said then , " I do n't spoil her . She 's very grateful , she takes nothing for granted , believe me . She knows what she has and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after what you 've done for her . " " You really should approve of her , Mama . She fits your standards far better than I do or ever could . She has beautiful tea party manners . You should see ! The neighbor next door has been teaching her . " " What neighbor ? " " The one who 's crippled with rheumatism . Leah goes in to help her , dresses her when she needs it , and fixes a little supper sometimes . The woman wants to pay her , but Leah wo n't hear of it . So the woman gives it to me , to put in the bank for her . She has almost two hundred dollars . " Well , that 's very nice , yes , it is , " Angelique conceded . " I can see that she has raised herself out of the ghetto to learn proper ways . Yes , it 's very nice . And I must say her speech is excellent . " " Leah 's bright . She loves life . " " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . " Funny , Hennie reflected , there was never any question that my sister or I would " do " anything . " Freddy is particularly nice to her , I notice , " Angelique remarked . " Why should n't he be ? Anyway , it 's been good for him to have another young person in the house . And she admires him so . She likes his little elegancies . It 's fine for his ego , even though he pretends to be amused by it . " " Let us hope it goes no farther than admiration and amusement . " " Mama ! I wish you would n't talk like that . " Hennie got up , frowning . " Why do you , anyway ? " " Do you think I do it to be nasty ? No , but a terrible mistake is being made , Hennie , and that 's why I have to speak my mind . "  | " What mistake ? Why ? Are we the first people to have adopted a child ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's done is done and ca n't be undone . You know what I 'm thinking  --  that you should let Paul pay for Yale and get Freddy out of the house . Obviously , you ca n't send Leah away at this point . " " Why on earth would we send her away ? " " You know she has a crush on Freddy , do n't you ? And that she may turn his head ? " Angelique 's mouth tightened . " The girl is fifteen years old . " " Fifteen . Quite so . I was n't much more than that when I was married . And she 's precocious . She knows a lot more than I did when I was her age or than you did , I assure you . Why , look at her ! Look at her walk , her figure . " Her breasts , Mama meant . Those full , swelling breasts , not possible to hide even under a loose shirtwaist and a plentifully ruffled camisole , were a bold affront to Angelique , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all of womanhood 's capacity for joy and susceptibility to pain . She saw in Leah 's body an appeal . " Hennie , you never see anything . " Agitated , Angelique twisted her rings , the round old-fashioned diamonds that had belonged to her own mother and that never left her fingers . " Your eyes are on the stars , or on world peace or woman suffrage or God knows what . You do n't see what is happening in your own house . Neither does Dan , not that I 'd expect him to . " " They 're like brother and sister . It 's nasty of you even to have such thoughts , Mama . " " Watch how she looks at him . " " She admires him ! It 's childish hero worship . And as for that  --  I can remember how ' sweet ' you used to say it was when Mimi and Paul were younger than Freddy is now . They looked so sweet together , you used to say . " " Yes , they did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come of it , or very likely will , I hope . " " Oh , it will come if you and Florence have any way to influence it . Men and women  --  boys and girls  --  should be able to have friendships without being forced into something else . What you all did with Paul was degrading , shoving them together ? "  | " Degrading ? You 're talking of a perfect match . Two fine young people , so suited to each other , two fine families ? " The dialogue had veered from Freddy and Leah to Mimi and Paul , now it veered back . " But there are other reasons , if not for that one . The education , the social experience he does n't get at home . Yale , after all , compared with City College . How can you deny it to him ? " " Dan wo n't hear of it . It 's against his principles and I happen to agree with him . " Besides , I do n't want Freddy to leave home . " Principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know all about those , do n't we ? " For a moment , Angelique stood regarding her daughter . A shadow of resignation , surprisingly tender and rather sad , passed unexpectedly across her face . " Well , I 'll say no more . I think I 'll go in for a little rest before I dress for dinner . " Hennie followed her mother 's straight back across the lawn . The frustrations of family life ! People thought they could say anything to you under the guise of love . And you could n't deny it was love . The righteous , well-meaning fist inside the velvet glove . " This is a farm , " Alfie liked to say . " We live simply here . " An Oriental rug , color of cream , color of faded roses  --  a Kirmanshaw , Paul guessed  --  made a spacious island on the dining room 's polished floor . Two lamps of Tiffany glass on the heavy sideboard contributed , with candles and the westering sun , to throwing a gilded light over the embroidered cloth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Paul looking at the lamps . " Art Nouveau . Do you like them ? " " They 're very fine . " " I do n't like them much , " Alfie said , with good nature . " But Emily loves anything that 's an animal or bird or plant . " " You 'd love Antonio Gaudi 's work , Aunt Emily . Whole buildings , the unfinished cathedral in Barcelona , covered with shells , birds , trees , and animals all carved in stone . You should see them . " " They tell me you 'll be going back to Europe soon , " Emily said . " Yes , I expect to have a busy summer . " Paul hesitated and then , risking Dan and Hennie 's denial for one more time , said to the table at  | large , " I 've been hoping Freddy might come with me . It would be a great experience before he starts at City College . " Dan said , although Paul had not looked toward him , " Hennie and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . It 's a generous offer . " " A very generous offer , " Angelique repeated with a cold glance at Dan . " A rare offer . " " Freddy is my brother , " Paul said quietly . Stupid pride of Dan 's ! A question of principle , too much luxury , traveling first class on the Lusitania . Irrelevant " principles , " as if asceticism were a virtue in itself ! It was the one side of Dan 's character  --  and Hennie 's  --  that made no sense to Paul . When the world was so replete with beauty ! Indeed , it would be wonderful if everyone could have a share ; indeed , it would be the Kingdom of God on earth . But until that came , why not enjoy however much of all that beauty fell to one 's lot ? " Going over on business ? " asked Alfie , taking a second helping of mashed potatoes . He had better watch his weight , Paul thought , conscious of his own flat stomach . He laid his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , Father 's given me quite a few commissions to carry out . He 's growing tired of doing business abroad and he wants to break me in . I hope his confidence will be justified . " Alfie was interested . " Where will you be going this time ? " " London first , a short stay in Paris , and then Germany . I 'm eager to go . " The eagerness welled up in him , a mingling of excitement and apprehension . " I have such a dread feeling that everything 's about to explode . This may be my last , or anybody 's , last trip to Europe for years . " " What makes you say that ? " asked Alfie . " Well , look what 's been happening ! The crisis in Morocco last summer ... " Alfie apologized . " I 'm afraid I do n't know much about those things . By the time I get through the financial section , with a few minutes for baseball and maybe " ? enjoying the joke on himself ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it ! So tell me , what are you expecting ? " " War , " Paul said simply . Dan 's voice boomed . " Let them bleed themselves to death over there . We 'll stay out of it . "  | " It wo n't work that way , Uncle Dan . The whole world will be in it , if it comes . " " Nonsense ! The laboring classes everywhere will refuse to fight . Why should a wage earner go to war to save his boss 's investments ? " " It 's not that simple . When the bands play , people do n't think . They wave their little flags and run alongside , like children following the circus parade . " " Such cynicism is n't like you , Paul . " " Realism , Uncle Dan . " Alfie said , " If war does come , I agree with Paul that we 'll be in it . Can you imagine what fortunes will be made ? " Dan shot him a look of outrage . " I meant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that anyone would really want the money that comes from human blood . Who could ? " " Plenty of people , " Dan answered . " Jingoes do n't talk about that side of war , do they ? Jingoes like Theodore Roosevelt . Only ' foolish idealists ' hope to eliminate war , he says . ' Cowards and physical weaklings , ' he says . Well , I 'll stand up to him or any other warrior type when it comes to weakness and cowardice ! " Freddy remarked softly , " There 's something to it , all the same . " His long fingers played delicately with the stem of a goblet . " What Roosevelt means is , one ought to be ready to die for principles . Some wars have to be fought . " His words astonished everyone . The slight frame , the slight stoop of the shoulders , the way the hair swept back from the fragile blue-veined temples , none of these fit the words . Dan answered succinctly , " Rubbish . " Alfie thought of something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd be a Roosevelt Progressive . Economic democracy and all that . " " True . But I do n't trust him on the war issue . So I 'm taking Wilson . What about you , Paul ? " " Not sure yet . Roosevelt or Wilson . I fight that out at home , because naturally the family 's for Taft . " Dan shook his head . " I 'll tell you one thing . If I were young , they would n't be able to make me bear arms . I would go to jail first . I would not fight , " he said , striking his fist on the table . " Well , I would , " declared Freddy , with equal emphasis . " I would be ready when called . Maybe , if I were needed , I would not even wait to be called . "  | Leah , who sat across from Freddy , sparkled with admiration . Her round eyes widened , and her lips parted . Dan shook his head . " Freddy , you may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a not too bright child . " " Let 's hope these are all only words , only something for interesting conversation . " Mimi 's smile went around the table , making peace . Emily and Angelique looked their approval of this tact ; Mimi had spoken like a hostess of experience , taking charge . Alfie added heartily , " Have a wonderful time , Paul , and think of us while you 're drinking wine on the boulevards . We 've never been , Emily and I. How about we set our sights on a trip , Emily ? No use waiting till we all need wheelchairs . How about year after next , and no fooling ? Meg will be eleven , old enough to enjoy the sights . Let 's see , that will be the summer of 1914 . " On that note , they all pushed back their chairs and left the dining room . Not without some difficulty , Alfie had finally gotten a fire started in the parlor . " The wood 's green , that 's what 's wrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waft of bitter smoke into the room . " Open the doors , clear the air , " he directed . French doors led to the terrace . Paul opened them and stepped out into a clear night . The moist winds , a refreshment after rich food and warm rooms , sponged his face . He stood still , letting it blow over him . From the dark woods at the foot of the hill a choir of peepers trilled without cease . There must be dozens  --  hundreds  --  of them , hailing the spring , he thought . And a sweet nostalgia surged through him . He wished Miqti had followed him outside to hear them , but she caught cold easily and it was still chilly . Presently he went back in . The room was now clear of smoke and the fire had taken hold . Alfie surveyed the comfortable semicircle of sofas and chairs . " Oh , I 'm learning , " he said , pleased with the crackling yellow flame . " 1 'm learning country ways pretty well , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've studied a lot about cows , got three Jerseys in the barn to start with . I 'll show you all the new barn tomorrow morning , if you do n't sleep too late . I never do . Do n't like to miss country life sleeping . "  | Two red setters settled down next to Alfie . He stroked them , then lit a pipe . The country gentleman , Paul thought kindly , yet with slight humor , remembering the somewhat irresponsible boy-uncle . Landed gentry . I daresay it 's Emily who 's responsible for a lot of it . If Alfie did n't have to make money , he would be content just living like this . He should have been born into the British squirearchy . He even looked the part , freshfaced and ruddy . Some people really did miss being born where they belonged : artists were born into commercial families and radicals were horn to aristocrats . I ? Where do I belong ? Do n't know , Paul thought critically . No sense wasting energy trying to figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then something else occurred to him . " Have you made many friends in the neighborhood ? " Emily did not answer . She was doing needlepoint , while Meg , in smocked organdy , took instruction beside her . Alfie said , " Well , it 's only been a year . Far apart as we all are around here , I do n't think most people even know we 've come yet . " They know you 're here , all right , Paul thought . They knew you were coming before you even moved in . The only Jew for twenty miles around , I 'll wager . Meg spoke suddenly . " Yes , they do . They do and they do n't like us . " " Why , Meg ! " cried Emily , laying her work down . " That 's not a nice thing to say . I 'm surprised ! " " You always tell me something 's not nice to say . You said that when I did n't get into Miss Allerton 's Sunday dancing class , and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfie spoke in haste . " Your mother was right . You should n't go around spreading false tales . " " It was n't false ! " Meg was at the edge of tears . " The class was n't full . I told you so . Janice 's mother told her they did n't take me because I'mwe 're  --  Jewish , and Janice was n't supposed to tell , but she did . " Despite her even tone , Emily was uncomfortably flushed . " I really do n't know whether that 's true , Meg , and if it is , it 's wiser not to talk about it . " Alfie made a deprecating gesture . " I do n't for one moment believe it 's true . The world 's changing , all that nonsense is " ? he sought a word ? " medieval , that 's what it is . You 'll be in that dancing class next season , you 'll see I 'm right . " " Well , they do n't like us here either , " Meg mumbled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily , obviously too disturbed by the subject to allow another word . And Meg , being well brought up , subsided , but not before Paul 's sympathetic glance had met hers . The child 's more realistic than Alfie is , he thought . And he felt himself to be a good deal older than his cheerful uncle . A hush of embarrassment fell temporarily upon the room . Then an auto passed outside , chugging up the hill . Emily put her work down and went to the window . " Now I wonder who that can be ? It 's too dark , I ca n't see . " " It 's probably that farmer down by the pond . He 's the only one around here who has an auto , " Alfie explained . " Of course , the summer people all have them ; you need one to get to the New York train . " " The summer people . Exactly . A rich man 's toy , " Dan said . " Let me tell you , if anything is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the automobile . It creates unsurpassed envy . " Leah had been unusually quiet all day . She senses the atmosphere in the house , Paul thought , and knows she is expected to be demure . Now she spoke . " But , Uncle Dan , suppose they learn to build them cheap enough so everybody can have one ? Then that would make life better ! " At home and at ease , Leah 's remarks were usually exclamations ; her opinions were discoveries . " Everybody to have one ? " Dan countered . " Do n't you realize that half the people in this country have n't even seen an auto ? And you talk of owning one ? Do n't talk about things you do n't know the first thing about , Leah . " Paul defended the girl . " She 's right , Uncle Dan . It 's beginning to happen already . We 're not talking about my Stevens Duryea , or a Renault . I know the flivver looks like a buggy without a horse , and it 's ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will get you where you want to go for only three hundred ninety-five dollars . " " That 's still a good deal of money , " Dan replied dryly , " a whole lot more than most people can afford . More than I can lay out comfortably , I know that . " He is so irritable tonight , Paul thought , wondering why . There was a subtle atmosphere of dissension in the room . And Alfie , not usually aware of subtleties , must have felt it , too , be-  | cause he said briskly , " What we need before we go to bed is some entertainment . How about some of your poetry , Meg ? " And he informed the gathering , " Meg has been writing some beautiful poems . " The child 's face clouded . " I do n't want to . " " Oh , come on , " Alfie coaxed . " You 're always so shy , Meg . Come on . " The child , in spite of being eight years old and large for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and younger . She appealed to her mother . " Do I have to ? " " Yes , of course , if your father asks you , " Emily replied , not looking up from the needlepoint . Resigned , Meg asked whether she should read or recite from memory . " Oh , recite ! " Alfie told her heartily . Neither one of them has the least understanding , Hennie thought , and was pierced with memory , seeing herself in the awkward girl , who , standing now with one foot turned in , jutting elbows , and hands folded on her stomach , began to chirp a rhyme about a family of rabbits . Emily leaned toward Hennie to whisper . " We 're trying to make her more confident . She 's too self-conscious , and so sensitive . You know , she cries when we have to go back to the city in September ! She worries about her rabbits . " Self-conscious ! Why should n't she be ? She does n't belong anywhere and you 're not helping her , Hennie thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons , they reminded her of the way Dan was with Freddy . Oh , not all the time , but often enough ! And she hoped Dan would n't ask Freddy to play the piano ; the tension , when Freddy hesitated , was too painful ; if he did finally play , he would go on too long , and it would be excruciating boredom for Alfie and A Emily , who did not care about music . Oh , she hoped Dan would n't ask ! Fortunately he did not . The clock ticked through desultory conversation ; Emily laid the needlepoint away ; the evening ended . Alfie opened the door to let the dogs out , so that the scented air flowed in and lured them all outside . Peepers had ceased . High up , the swaying top of an ancient copper beech etched a pattern against a glitter of stars . Underneath , the earth , rank with leaf mold , lay in dark blue shade . Mimi was the first to speak . " I 'm going in . I 'm so fearful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Alfie called to the dogs , and all said good night . Only Leah resisted . " You can all go in , but I 'm going down to the pond to see the light on the water . It 's too wonderful to waste time sleeping . Did n't you say so , Uncle Alfie ? Who 'll come with me ? Freddy ? " " It 's pitch-dark , " Dan grumbled . " You 'll break a leg falling over a rock . " Leah laughed . " Do n't worry . I 'm like a cat . I can see in the dark . " For an instant , Paul 's eyes met Dan 's frowning ones ; then Dan 's went blank and Paul looked away . For a moment they stood watching Leah move off down the slope with Freddy following and disappear among the trees . Then they , too , went inside . On their last night , upstairs in the black walnut guest room , Dan slung his shirt onto the bed , muttering . " What a nuisance to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home in the morning . Tell me why one has to change one 's clothes to eat . . . " He dropped a collar stud and bent to search for it under the bureau . " Oh , I hate dressing up ! " It was a family joke , the way he fussed about clothes . On the other hand , Freddy had packed carefully for this weekend ; he always had liked to dress . He had never been a messy , careless small boy . Hennie could well remember his little striped jacket , his bow ties , and cloth-topped button shoes and how he 'd always said he liked the smooth feel of new cloth . Before the mirror now , she regarded the brooch at the neck of her crackling taffeta waist . It had belonged to her grandmother Miriam and sparkled nicely . Dan studied her . " You 're a good-looking woman , Hennie . " " Am I ? " " I always tell you you are . " Yes , and I always feel and act surprised . I should take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Already in bed , he was stretching ; the muscles moved under his milky skin . He did n't age , and she wondered whether he would still look like that when she was a flabby old woman . " What are you thinking ? " she asked , for he was frowning . " I was thinking that maybe Freddy should go to Europe with Paul after all . "  | " You ca n't have changed your mind ! " " Maybe I have . " " Well , we 've lived all these years ourselves without seeing Europe . " " True , but you have to admit it 's an opportunity for him . " " I do n't know what I think about his going , especially with Paul . " " Why especially with Paul ? That surprises me . " " You know I adore Paul . He had my heart before I had Freddy , and he still has it , but  --  he 's a sybarite . " She hesitated . " A rich man 's son , an art collector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Freddy , giving him expensive tastes . " " He has them already , " Dan said darkly . He paused , then seemed to be choosing his words with special care . " I 've been thinking , too , maybe Yale would be a good thing for him , after all . " She had been brushing her hair . Now she put the brush down and stared at Dan . " I ca n't believe what I 'm hearing ! Why on earth do you think it would be good for him ? " " Oh , a new environment , " Dan said vaguely . " My God , you sound like my mother ! " " Well , she could possibly be right , once in her life , could n't she ? " " I ca n't get over it ! You , in agreement with my mother ! And you never approved of private education ! City College , you said . Free education . It 's what you believed in . " " I still believe , but ? " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe it would be better , that 's all . " " I feel as if you 'd struck me on the head ! " Then she thought of something . " Where will you get the money ? You surely wo n't accept Paul 's ? " " What do you think I am ? It 's Werner money , no matter that Paul says it 's his own . No . I 'll take Alfie up on that offer he made tonight . That 's what I 'll do . I 'll take a five thousand payment on my vacuum tube , assuming Alfie can do what he said . I 've a couple of other things on the fire besides . " " All of a sudden , all of this at one blow ! You 've been doing a whole lot of thinking , keeping it from me . " " No . I decided everything right now , tonight . I think it would be good for Freddy , that 's all , " Dan repeated . " Why ? What 's wrong with home all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you wo n't like it . "  | page deleted  | Dan lies awake . Sleep , immediate and profound , usually follows after love , but tonight his mind is wide-awake , troubled by the abrupt decisions he has just made . For some reason that he does not fully understand , he can not tell Hennie the whole truth . Last night also he lay awake , waiting for the sound of footsteps on the stairs . He heard the tall clock on the landing strike the half hour , the hour , and another half hour . Hennie , already asleep , apparently assumed that Leah and Freddy were in their rooms , so he let her sleep and bore the burden of his thoughts alone . Just as well . An hour and a half to watch the starlight on the pond ? No doubt of it , the girl was the aggressor . This was by no means the first time he had seen it . A passionate young thing ; her flesh was fragrant , hard in the right places , soft in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would n't need to be courted or coaxed ! On the other hand , though , maybe she would ; she was a smart young thing , too , and she 'd want a safe marriage , with a ring on her finger , preferably a flawless diamond . She 'd find her way in the world , that much was certain ; she was bold and strong . Not like Hennie . Little bitch ! Suppose she were to get pregnant ? His thoughts go in circles . There is , and has for a long time , been a gap between himself and his son . He has vague , hidden fears , of which he is terribly ashamed , so ashamed that he ca n't even face himself with them , let alone Hennie : the fear that his son is not  --  quite a man . There are words for this concept , but he ca n't frame it even in the silence of his own mind . Again his thoughts skim around in circles . If that is so , ought he not to welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of desire ? No . They are far too young . And she is a little bitch . He ought never to have given in to Hennie . . . . So , he has made the right decision . Best to send Freddy away to Yale , and let him go abroad with Paul next summer . Paul will do him good . Maybe he 'll make a man of him . Never mind what Hennie calls sybaritic ! Paul has his feet on the ground . . . . . $ At the far end of the hall , the " passionate young thing " lies smiling up at the ceiling . The satin quilt is glassy smooth under her chin . She puts a hand out to smooth it . Nice . Nice things in this house . Not a very smart house , not like some that she sees in the magazines , but very comfortable . Everything in it is good . Someday she will have a house like this ,  | only better , certainly in better taste . Vividly she recalls the tenement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is sure . She sniffs her arm , which smells of the perfumed soap in the guest bathroom . She loves the feel of her skin ; it is as smooth as the satin cover . She has a good complexion , dark , with a flush of rose under the surface . She has beautiful breasts , too , round like the ones on statues in the museums , not pear-shaped like so many girls ' , the kind that will soon droop . She fondles her breasts ; it is a wonderful feeling and makes her think of things you 're not supposed to think about . Who says you 're not supposed to ? Well , everyone . But she thinks about them , and dreams of them often ; always there is a thin blond man in the dream , who could or could not be Freddy . She likes thin blond men , romantic , elegant , and refined . Like Freddy . He is so terribly shy , though . Last night at the pond , she made him kiss her ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a time when he refused to kiss her at all ! That girl , Mimi , in the other bed , turns in her sleep . It 's doubtful that such a proper lady has Leah 's dreams ; probably she dreams about tennis or the horse she keeps stabled in the city near the park ! Leah laughs . Sleepy at last , she falls back into her dreams . So many half dreams in the house ! The child Meg dreads the return to school and the mean girls who lead the class . She 's an outsider . It 's only here on the farm that she feels safe . Alfle and Emily curl together in comfortable habit , with their own contentment . They have the ability to pretend that nasty things never really happened , or do n't matter . Freddy , so tired from the day 's exertions , drifts too slowly into sleep . They do n't ever let you sit still at Alfie 's house . Leah , gay Leah , never lets him sit still . She disturbs him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while in another he 's not sure , he 's a little afraid . Paul fills asleep with contented recollections of the day , thoughts of work and of his charming Mimi ; his life is arranging itself and he can sleep well . Unbeknownst to Dan , Hennie is also troubled . She wishes for a woman to confide in , and thinks of Florence , who always knew how to solve things , and would be kind . . . . She worries about Freddy ; she worries because for some reason , Dan still wo n't accept Leah as a  | daughter . Maybe he himself does n't even know why . Vaguely , she worries about herself and Dan , then scolds herself for doing so . She knows one thing , though : that it 's good to be past first youth with all its pains , good to have survived them and to be here with Dan , in spite of all . So will today 's young survive , too , she finally reassures herself , growing drowsy at last . The planet spins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightwind rises , soughing through the trees . A cow lows again in the barn . Small wild scurrying creatures squeak in the wood lot . Under the roof , each sleeper escapes from himself and the others . Yet it is only for the space of the night . For , separate and disparate as they are , they are yet bound . Blood and love and memory , sometimes even hatred , have bound them . They are tied in a hundred secret ways , and ' will be . The old house settles and creaks.  | The sinking sun hung like a red balloon over the Hudson River and the wintry Palisades . From the fourth-floor window Dan looked down onto Riverside Drive , where cars and buses and windblown walkers hurried . He looked without seeing ; his thoughts were elsewhere . " What are you dreaming about ? You 've been standing there for five minutes . " On the rumpled bed the girl sat pulling on her stockings . She yawned and complained in her whispery little voice , " Oh , I could fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do n't you ? There 's no reason why you should n't . " " Because I want to ride downtown on the bus with you . That 's a whole extra hour to be together . " " It 's miserably cold . Besides , you 'll have to ride back again alone , " he objected , not feeling any need for an extra hour . " You talk as if you did n't want me ! " " I only meant ? " " Darling , never mind what you meant . I 'm coming . Just let me fix my hair . " He glanced at the bedside clock . " Please hurry . I 've got to go . "  | " Do n't I know you 're due home on the dot for dinner ? I 'll just be a second . " The comb snapped electricity through her blue-black hair . It was the hair that had lured him in the first place , he reflected now . Seldom did one see hair so black ; against the whiteness of skin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been perfectly brilliant . She was not beautiful ; he had never for a moment thought she was ; yet she had caught him and held him all this past year . Each time he 'd been with her he 'd been sorry afterward , counting the cost of the lies and subterfuges that were an unavoidable part of these Saturday afternoons , and hating the guilt that fevered him when he walked back into his house . Each time he 'd told himself that today had been the last . Each time , by the middle of the week , he 'd begun to think about Saturday and whether she 'd make him wait or be ready in the bed . And each time , leaving her , he 'd been ashamed of himself for being unable to keep away . " There ! " she said , giving him her bright , expectant smile , wanting praise . " How do I look ? " " Pretty . That 's a nice hat . " She had wound a flamboyant purple turban around her head ; it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye-sockets . She looked mysterious , secretive and tense . Odd , he thought as he followed her downstairs , for she was none of those things . She was lazy , candid , and frankly demanding ; she wanted him permanently for her own , even though he had told her a hundred times that that was impossible . They crossed the Drive to wait in the gusting wind for the bus . When it came , it was almost empty , the flow of traffic being uptown this late in the day . They had the backseat to themselves . Bernice gasped . " That wind freezes your bones ! Let me warm myself , will you ? " She raised his arm to settle around her shoulders , laid her head on his chest , and curved herself into him as if they were in bed . She had no selfconsciousness at all , while he , on the other hand , was humiliated by public display . This time , though , there was no one behind them to see the display , so it did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfume , an Oriental scent , Persian or Indian ; it made him think of dancing ankles with bells attached , and of nakedness under veils ; no doubt it was intended to . No dooryard daisies for Bernice ! All was calculated for arousal . He had to smile at the wiles , so vulgar  --  and so effective !  | " Why are you smiling ? " she asked . " How do you know I am ? " " I can see up out of the corner of my eye . Why are you ? " " I do n't know , " he lied . " Just feeling good , I guess . " " I 'm glad I make you feel good . I do , do n't I ? " " You do . " The bus had jolted and lurched across 110th Street and begun its way downtown along Fifth Avenue . Homes of the middle class were replaced by the limestone residences of the rich . Bernice raised her head . " Beautiful , are n't they ? " " What are ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back it will be dark , and sometimes I can see a little bit through the curtains . Just enough to give an idea of it . Crystal chandeliers , mostly . Must be wonderful , do n't you think ? " " Does n't tempt me . Quite the opposite . " The bus slowed down , nearing a corner , to pick up a passenger . " You 're such a funny duck , Dan ! You do n't want anything , do you ? Except me . " She reached up and kissed his mouth . Her lips pulled softly and slowly . Alarmed , he tried to draw away . " Bernice ! Not here ! " " Why ? You do n't know any of these people from Adam . " " It is n't ? " He stopped . The passenger who had just climbed in , who was staring at them in total , absolute astonishment , was Leah . A chill and a sweat came over him . And with a queer , reflexive movement , he jumped up . He stammered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me help ? " The girl was carrying two large dress-boxes . " Thank you , I 'll stay in front . I 'm only riding six blocks . " She sat with her back to Dan . Her calm , straight back . While his heart pounded . His face must be fire-red . Caught out . With a couple of million people running around in this enormous city . How was it possible ? " Who 's that ? You look just awful ! " At least Bernice had the good sense to whisper . He frowned furiously . " Not now . " At 87th Street , without a word , Leah got out . He watched her cross the avenue , walking with head up , as if she meant business . A girl , hardly out of childhood . She could destroy him . She had the power .  | " Who on earth was that ? " Bernice pressed him . " My daughter . Step-daughter . Adopted daughter . Oh , for God 's sake , I do n't know what she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder you acted so funny ! Poor Danny . What 's she doing in this part of town ? " " She works after school in a dress shop . Sometimes she has to deliver a last-minute alteration . " " You 're afraid she 's going to tell ? " " Of course I 'm afraid ! What do you think ? Oh , Christ ! " He bit his lip . He stared out at the dusk and the streetlights , which were just coming on . How to explain this away ? The woman lying all over him , her mouth lingering . He was supposed to have been at an electronics exhibit this afternoon too . Ninety-nine chances out of a hundred , Leah would run to Hennie with the story the minute they were alone . She loved Hennie . Hennie was her mother . Oh , Christ ! " I 'm sorry , Danny . I really am . " No , you 're not , he thought . You 'd like nothing better than to have my marriage blow up . You think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've no right to feel sorry about that , either , because I told you from the start , I was honest with you . I do n't suppose you believed me , though . Women always hope . " I wish I could help you , Danny . " She sounded so piteous that he had to look at her . She was a good soul , after all , a very ordinary soul who happened to own an extraordinary body that was bound to get her into trouble . An accident of fate . What had just happened now to him , that , too , was an accident of fate ! " I do n't want to talk . I have to think , Bernice , " he said gently . " All right . You know what ? I 'll leave you here and take the bus home , so you can think by yourself . " She stood and rang the bell for exit . " Danny . . . I 'm sure you 'll work it out . Just let me know , will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He sat and pondered and shook internally all the way to his stop . Yet , what was there to ponder ? It all depended upon Leah . One chance in a ' : thousand . At the supper table he pushed food around his plate . It gagged him . ? He had to be careful not to let his eyes meet Leah 's . He felt hatred for her . He felt like an interloper at the table , an embezzler whose books  | were to be examined in the morning . He had lost his dignity , his dual dignity as the head of the house and the respected teacher at the school . Would she , could she , possibly spread the tale all around the school too ? Yes , of course she could , and what an entertaining tale it would be ! At the same time he knew that all these thoughts were quite unreasonable ; what he was feeling was simply the kind of hatred that comes with owing money to someone and being unable to pay him . What he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dry , so that he kept sipping water . No one noticed . They were all talking . He heard fragments : school gossip , neighborhood gossip . The boy downstairs had found Freddy 's lost ice skates . The woman upstairs had appendicitis . Then he heard his own name . Hennie asked , " Was there anything special at the exhibit today , Dan ? " He could n't look over at her . " No , it was n't much . " " Really ? That 's too bad . I remember , last time you said it was marvelous . So many new things . " " It was n't much , " he repeated . Now his eyes slid toward Leah ; he was n't able to control them . She had a forkful of string beans to manage . She did n't want to see him . And he took another sip of water . As soon as the dishes had been cleared away , Hennie said she had an errand , a box of old clothes to be taken to the settlement house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her on such errands to carry the heavy box . But to be alone with her right now .. . " I 'll go with you . I have to go to the library before it closes , " Freddy said , and asked Dan , " You do n't mind ? " " No , go ahead . I 'll read the paper . " So he would be here with Leah . Better so . Get it over with . Know where he stood . As if he did n't know already . As soon as they had left he went to the window and pulled the curtain adds . They crossed the street under the lamplight . His wife . His son . He watched until they were out of sight and stayed there , seeing nothing now except whirling lights and darkness , while in his head another whirllnj almost cost him his balance . 0o . Clef It over with . He knocked on Leah 's door . " Yes ? " she said coldly . " Leah . . . may I talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It wo n't take long . Please open the door . " She opened it . Her slow gaze went from his face to his feet and back to his burning face . He felt stripped . Sixteen years old , and she was commanding his future , enjoying her command . " About today , " he began . " You 're very young , and ? " " Too young to understand , you think ? " " No , I ? Well , yes , in a way . It 's a question of experience , life experience , you see , and  --  what I mean to say is , things are n't always what they seem , and this thing today was ? " The girl 's round eyes were black as bullets and as fierce . " You 're wasting your energy . You know that I know what this thing ' was . Anybody would . " " Wait . If you 'd just let me explain ? " And he was struck still by the recollection of what Leah had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tight jacket , the long kiss . What was there to explain ? He said abruptly , desperately , " I love Hennie . Surely you 've seen ' that ? This had nothing to do with her . Nothing . " " I love her t6o , " Leah said with scorn . " I understand that your loyalty is to her , and that 's only right . " " But you 're afraid I 'll tell her . " He did n't answer . Even his legs cringed weakly . " If I did n't love her so much , I would . It 's because I love her that I o n't hurt her . Not now . Not ever . So you need n't worry . " " Can I depend on that , Leah ? " he begged . " If I say I wo n't tell , I wo n't . " Still he doubted . " Is that truly a promise ? " " I told you , you need n't worry . I do n't lie . " He could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , Leah. ' 11 never forget . . . . It 's only right for you to know that that woman 4 ay was . . . These things are sometimes a sort of accident , nothing at lasts . Not love . " " Then that makes it really disgusting . " Still they stood at the threshold of her room . The word disgusting had apped through the air between them ; now it lingered for a moment or o in his ears . At her age she would naturally see it that way ; youth makes very harsh judgment . Still , the judgment was not all wrong . . . . " It wo n't happen again , this sort of thing , " he murmured .  | " That 's no business of mine . I have my homework now , " she told him . " Yes , go ahead . And thank you , Leah . You 're a good person , " he repeated humbly . Then he went to the parlor , took up the evening paper , and tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew past his eyes . Presently he realized how he was sitting : bent over , huddled , with every muscle contracted and even his face contorted . He straightened them and stood to flex his arms and rub the hard knot at the back of his neck . Not worth it , he thought . To risk my darling Hennie 's trust and love ! I always truly knew it was n't worth it . But the glutton knows what he 's doing to himself and so does the drunkard . And they keep on doing it . Some of them do learn , though , and stop , and stay stopped . Leah 's door opened . He heard her go through the hall into the kitchen and open the icebox . He heard the double clink of the milk bottle and the cookie jar . A child , he 'd said of her ; yet there was nothing childish in her compassion for Hennie or her furious indignation on Hennie 's behalf . For these , he thought now , I thank you , Leah , from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized it , the old familiar surge of resolve . And he brushed a hand across his eyes as if to clarify a vision of himself that had been soiled and dulled . He knew exactly what he must do , what he wanted with all his strength to do , and the knowledge cleansed him . From the desk he took a sheet of writing paper and sat down . " Dear Bernice , " he began . Clearly , kindly , and firmly he told her that they had come to the end . He hastened the pen down the sheet , signed his name , and sealed the envelope . Done . Finished with her , the last and final . Finished with them all , so help him God .  | June 17th , 1912 Dear Hennie and Dan , We 've been here in the country for almost a week . I still have a few days ' worth of meetings in London and clients to see , but the Warrens , good old friends that they are , would n't hear of me not giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call their place . So here we are , Freddy and I , and it is lovely , there being no season quite as lovely , I think , as an English summer , so fresh and moist . Freddy and I share a room , since the house is full . There 's a fair assortment of guests , cousins , aunts and uncles , one of them a vicar straight out of Oliver Goldsmith . Five or six very young boys and girls ( I lose count since they all seem to look alike ) and Mr. Warren 's nephew Gerald , who , by some good chance , is exactly Freddy 's age . That will soothe my conscience when I return to finish up in London , leaving Freddy here . They 've invited him , I suppose , because he 'll be company for the nephew , and , of course , he wants to stay . He 's " seen " London , the Tower , the palace , Harrods , the changing of the guard  --  the whole wonderful business . They say about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three years , and the same is true of London . Freddy 's had two weeks of it , so I 'll let him just enjoy this countryside . Anyway , he 's enchanted by everything that 's English , I 'm afraid ! It has been a case of love at first sight . Last night he sat on the side of his bed , pulling his socks off , and then suddenly , just halting as if he were caught in a dream , sat there holding a sock in midair and said to me , " You wo n't believe me , but I could stay here forever . " I could n't help but laugh , he looked so stunned . I told him I was glad he was feeling the atmosphere and that that 's how you should feel when you travel . Of course he has n't met the other England , the unemployed and homeless sleeping on the benches along the Embankment near Westminster , the same sort of scene you can unfortunately find at home . Such things must be seen with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself with the picturesque . Speaking of the picturesque , right now there 's a flock of sheep ambling down the road , being guided by three busy dogs . I always like to watch the way these clever dogs can maneuver a hundred sheep . It 's a scene out of past centuries , timeless , peaceful , and somehow comforting . Yesterday morning we went riding . Freddy has never been on a horse , as you know , so I was somewhat nervous about taking him along , although they got the gentlest mare in the stables for him . Still , I was nervous . Should n't want to get stuck in Europe with a broken arm or leg , and the rest of the summer still to go ! But Freddy was game and took instruction very well . There were no mishaps and we are going Spin tomorrow . There go Freddy and Gerald to the tennis court . I 'm Nlpposed to play doubles with them and one of the other houseguests , a gout sixty years old who plays as vigorously as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's almost uniform here : tall , lean , and fit . 1 ! Np now , they 're waiting for me , and finish this letter tomorrow N Off to you . I know you are anxious to hear about your boy . June 18th , 1912 i from yesterday : it 's pouring this morning , that En1 'M Laid about , so that the countryside drips green . Every- OM ' p late or reading or writing letters in his room . *  | ? no , that 's not the right word , I should rather say " enthralled " ? everyone by his playing . He was n't a bit shy , as he usually is , about playing to the group after dinner and even made a nice little speech before starting about how he was going to play an American piece by Edward MacDowell , who studied with Cesar Franck , et cetera . Then , by request , he played some Chopin , perfect fare for a summer night in the country . I 've never heard him play so well . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist , and I do n't understand what holds him back . People were absolutely still . They have all , older people especially , taken to him , attracted by his modest ways , and , of course , delighted by the way he expresses his feeling for England . Again , I am so glad you agreed to let him come with me . On Monday , I go back to London for a few more appointments , after which Freddy will join me there and we 'll be off to Paris . All my fondest wishes to you both , PAUL June 22nd , 1912 The pages in my travel diary are filling up , which will please Grandmother Angelique . The book looks like her , impressive and expensive , with my name in gold : Frederick Roth . Here I am in deep country . The house is Elizabethan ; they say Cromwell slept here . The lintel in the bedroom is so low that I bump my head every time I walk in . Sparrows are racketing in the ivy that covers the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ' growth . I stood at the window a while ago , watching the dew burn off and a horse and wagon creep up the hill . Like a scene out of Constable ! It could n't have looked different in his time , except for the telegraph poles , which I try not to see . I think I could stay here and never go home . Gerald has been taking me all over the countryside , on foot , on horseback and bicycle . He 's the most wonderful companion . I 've never known anyone like him and feel that I 've always known him . How can he know so much more , and still be only my age ? He 's reading history at Cambridge ; what they call " reading " is what we call one 's major . He 's got so many interests , knows flowers and animals , plays cricket and rides . He got his first pony when he was three years old . What 's so appealing is that he 's so quiet and unassuming . That 's probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26th , 1912 First time in almost a week that I 've had time to jot down anything , which I regret because I want to get it all down before I forget things . I like the manners and the kindliness here . I surely have n't seen much of them in New York , at least where I live ! The farm laborer tips his hat to the man on horseback and the man returns the compliment . I often see a carriage full of ladies toiling uphill , while the ladies get out and walk to spare the horses . I like that , too . We passed a huge estate belonging to Lord Somebody-or-Other . We kept on passing his land ; one could n't see the house , which , Gerald said , is almost a mile from the gates . It has four hundred rooms . In addition , this lord owns fifty thousand acres in Scotland and a winter place in the south of France . All we could glimpse were some yew hedges around the gatehouse and topiary , clipped like crenelated castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admire the topiary . A heavyset man on an equally heavy horse came riding up the lane , and prepared to turn into the estate . With his long , grizzly beard , bald head , and ruddy face , he looked like a farmer out of Thomas Hardy , but it turned out he was the brother of the owner . He greeted Gerald , asked about the family , would have tipped his hat , I 'm sure , if he 'd been wearing one , and trotted on up the splendid drive toward the house . Maybe it 's childish of me , I know Paul thinks it is , but I was really impressed by the fine simplicity of the man . Noblesse oblige , I guess . June 30th , 1912 I 'm staying up late , rethinking the day . I have an impulse to write a poem and have been trying to start a few lines , but nothing happens . Gerald has talent . He 's read me some of his poetry and it 's rather good , goes straight to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and read me some beautiful stuff ' I 'd never heard before . I copied one in particular by A. E. Housman that also went straight to the heart . It 's about soldiers , very brave and sad and moving . " For the calling bugles hollow , High the screaming fife replies , Gay the files of scarlet follow : Woman bore me . I will rise . "  | July 1st , 1912 Gerald has a girl . He showed me her picture . She 's not as pretty as Leah . He talks about Daphne a lot . He says she 's the real thing , not like other girls he 's had , but deeply spiritual , a real love . I can see how a girl would be in love with Gerald . He 's so clean and manly . Last night I had a dream that left me terribly upset . I was in love with Gerald and he was a girl ; then suddenly he was himself again . I 'm ashamed to write down what we actually did in the dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in dreams . It 's like the way I sometimes dream about Leah ; she 's doing things , offering me  --  like that night by the pond at Uncle Alfie 's  --  and in a way I want to , I want to feel , she 's so pretty ; yet I do n't feel July 2nd , 1912 Paul calls me an Anglophile . I ca n't tell whether he likes it or not . I think he finds me a trifle foolish . Young , wet behind the ears . So be it . I think the world of him all the same , and ca n't thank him enough . I wish I could talk more to Paul about these feelings , the way I feel about Leah and Gerald , but I ca n't . I do n't know why , we 've always been so close . Maybe it 's because he never talks intimately to me , never says anything about Mimi , for instance , even though they 'll surely be married . You 'd think he 'd want to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose I am too . July 3rd , 1912 We saw an owl last night . I 'd never heard one , much less seen one . We were sitting out-of-doors on the lawn after dinner when we heard him hoot , and there he was , not twenty feet away , on a low branch , staring at us out of his great yellow eyes . Afterward , when it grew chilly , we went inside and they asked me to play again . I played " Eine Kleine Nacht Musik . " This is a group that would cherish Mozart , rather than music with bravura flourishes . Mozart is so pure , so subtle , it is music at its purest . I remember once my father said it very well , that Mozart is simple as truth is simple , and then he said something about science and art meeting and being one . Very beautifully put . I know my father is disappointed in me . . in more ways than one ,  | I 'm afraid . That 's why it has become so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his presence . I have some very uncomfortable thoughts , certain memories , when he 's there . . . not always , but sometimes . He hopes  --  or I suppose by now has given up hope  --  that I will do what he was n't able to do , sit down before a huge audience and let my soul flow out through my fingers . Then take my elegant bows . Absurd ! I 'm good , but I 'm not good enough . And that 's almost worse than being no good at all . July 4th , 1912 Tomorrow is the last day . Then I meet Paul in London and we leave for Paris . I want to go , yet I feel sadness at leaving here . Yesterday we traveled to Glastonbury , Gerald and I , with two of his friends from Cambridge . We looked down on the Vale of Avalon , once a sea , they say , where on the Isle of Avalon , King Arthur was taken by boat to die . It gives you chills , thinking of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arch of a tower remaining , and grass growing on the base of what were once tall towers . It 's said that Arthur and Guinevere are buried there . We stood listening to the silence . The only sound was the wind on the hill . It was awesome . I felt the ancient dignity and grace . It 's almost as if I had an English heritage , these old , old villages seem so familiar , with the peaceful fields around them . It 's worth fighting a war , if need be , to keep it all like this . Gerald and I had a long talk all afternoon . We talked about everything : Daphne , Yale , Cambridge , his home and my home . It was hard to describe mine . A good home , surely ! But how to describe my parents ? He would n't like them because he 'd sense they did n't approve of him , and I know they would n't . Too traditional , they 'd say . I can hear them , especially my father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd say . He thinks I am , too , I know . Oh , he 'd resent everything here , the servants especially . I asked Gerald whether he thought I should become a medievalist or a classicist . I 'm sure I will specialize in history . Gerald says it 's too soon to tell , that I should give both a chance before I decide . This visit has been a great influence on me . I have found a lifelong friend , even though there 'll be an ocean between us . I 've never had this feeling before , this swift , immediate understanding , as if he were , in some unfathomable way , the other half of myself .  | Paris , July 9th , 1912 Dearest Mimi , We arrived here two days ago and this is the first chance I 've had to ? , write . Father had a list of appointments that began the moment we got off the boat train . The trip is almost at the halfway mark , and fine as it all has been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can guess why ! I started to miss you on the ship coming over . There were so many little incidents , interesting , types , and conversations heard and overheard ( you know how curious I always am ) , that I would have liked to tell about , to hear your comments and opinions , or maybe just have you listen to mine , which you do so well . You 're a perfect listener . Yes , I miss you . I suppose that 's really what loving is , if you want to put it at its simplest : just being at ease together , wanting to be together . I happened to speak on the telephone this morning to the wife of one of our clients , a Madame Lamartine , whom you may possibly remember . You met her when you were here with your parents a few years ago . Well , she remembers you ! " And how is la chere petite Marian ? ' " she asked , and called you " a delightful child . " So you see what an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been more than twelve either , as I figure it . She was very f pleased when I told her , in absolute confidence , that we were going to be engaged very soon . I hope you do n't mind my spilling the beans . Tomorrow I plan to take a little time off to see something of Paris besides offices and banks . I want to visit some of my favorite places , have lunch at Pre Catalan in the Bois , watch the sidewalk artists in the Place du Tertre and roam through the bookstalls on the Left Bank . Someday , I hope , we 'll see all these together . Right now it will be fun to show it all to Freddy . He 's so enthusiastic , l such a nice kid . But I must say I am really glad to have gotten him out of England . He pines for it , or at least for that tiny part with which he seems to have fallen in love . What rot they all talk there ! I 'm thinking of one night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture those boys made in their white flannels , sprawled out in white wicker chairs , with the white lime blossoms overhead . And what do you think they were talking about , young Gerald and his Cambridge friends , while Freddy took it all in
