Any enterprise that regularly raises its prices while letting its service slip is almost sure to drive away customers . Unless , of course , that enterprise happens to be a monopoly like the U.S. Postal Service , which is still the only organization legally allowed to deliver first- and third-class mail . The Postal Service is cutting back on operations and capital spending even as its volume of mail  --  500 million letters , publications and packages every day  --  grows by about 6% a year . Many customers are frustrated : complaints about delayed mail rose by 18% in 1987 . <P> Yet the Postal Service is preparing to raise its rates next month by an average of 17.5% , the first increase since 1985 . The cost of sending a first- class letter will jump from 22 cents to 25 cents , which means consumers will be buying stamps marked only by the letter E until the higher price can be printed on new ones . Businesses that rely on third-class mail will be hit harder , by increases of up to 25% . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reform . Last week President Reagan 's Commission on Privatization recommended that the Postal Service be stripped of its letter-mail monopoly so that it would be forced to do a better job . Says James Miller , director of the Office of Management and Budget and a longtime proponent of privatization : " The Postal Service is a monstrosity . It is overstaffed , overpriced and inefficient . Postal patrons are paying more and more and getting less and less in return . " <P> That may be true , but not all the fault lies with the Postal Service . Though it was reorganized in 1970 as an independent federal agency that operates as a break-even business , the Postal Service has not escaped Government meddling in its operations . The service 's fiscal crunch is largely a creature of the budget compromise forged by Congress and the Administration in the wake of last October 's stock-market crash . As part of the deal , Congress required the Postal Service to trim $1.2 billion from its estimated $35 billion annual operating budget over the next two years . Making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital expenditures by 74% this year . <P> To meet those targets , the Postal Service in January ordered sweeping cuts in service . It eliminated all Sunday pickups from mailboxes and trimmed window-service hours at 34,000 post offices across the U.S. by an average of half a day a week . The Postal Service canceled or postponed billions of dollars ' worth of new construction and equipment purchases , most of which were intended to modernize mail handling and speed up delivery by replacing outmoded facilities . <P> Postal performance is likely to deteriorate as a result . Employees at the Decatur , Ga. , post office , now close down the service windows every Wednesday afternoon to catch up with their sorting duties . In Florida , where the population is growing by some 1,000 people every day , 56 of 59 facilities that the Postal Service planned to build in the southern part of the state have been postponed indefinitely . Says Miami Postmaster Woodrow Conner : " No business can take the cuts we have taken and not have problems . We can not tell customers there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
