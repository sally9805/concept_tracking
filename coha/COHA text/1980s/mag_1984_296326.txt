Painters garnish the edge with daubs , cutouts , even cutlery <P> " The Louvre at first was only gold frames to me , " Gertrude Stein once wrote . " In a way it destroyed paintings for me . " By the early 20th century , artists and enlightened collectors were already beginning to do away with old-fashioned picture frames , with their gilded inlets and adamant pirouettes . Let painting be painting , they decided , without a competing spectacle at its own borders . This preference soon converged with Bauhaus notions of design , which enforced the modernist distaste for frills . By midcentury , the opponents of effusive framing had their ultimate triumph : the frameless wafers of abstract expressionism . <P> No conquering style in the arts , however , is safe from a return of the vanquished , often dressed as an avantgarde . Today spartan modernism has been surprised in its sleep by a postmodern taste for ornament and the revival of moribund styles . Partly as a result , some artists are garnishing the edge again . Trompe l'oeil frames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that not long ago featured only trim metal runners . <P> The change reflects new fashions in art . Impassive styles of the 1960s and ' 70s - the chaste morsels of minimalism , the arctic pleasures of conceptualism - are now well in retreat before a wave of gesture , expressionism and all the tumult of " painterly " painting . Encouraged by a climate favoring vigor and personality , artists are propelling the brush past the borders of the canvas or turning out sculpturally elaborated frames that complement work in which the hand prevails . At the same time , a general drift away from resolutely flat abstractions and a return to representational painting have revived notions of the picture as a window onto the illusion of a three-dimensional space . Says Painter Neil Jenney , who uses oversize frames to magnify his intentions as a realist : " Illusionistic painting demands a frame . It functions as a foreground . The frame is ' here , ' with you ; the illusion is ' there , ' in the picture . " <P> Not surprisingly , playful frames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ones most likely to resist received tradition ( and to follow fashion ) . A deliberately cartoonish image by Kenny Scharf sports edges decked with plastic dinosaurs and rockets . Larger-than-life wooden silhouettes - two birds , for instance , or a garland of branches - shoot up around the landscapes of Alan Herman . More established figures are also working in the same vein . Howard Hodgkin , whose canny strokes of pigment hint at enclosed views , sweeps paint across the frame to twit its pretensions as the final proscenium . <P> Like Hodgkin , some artists are not so much working on the frame as working past it . They spill color across its borders to reject its entrenched authority . Others are working with decorative attachments and sculptural effects , not mocking the frame but embracing it , to restore a bit of the heraldic function that frames sometimes filled in the past .
