When he was still a lonely high school kid in Martins Ferry , Ohio , the factory worker 's son who would later become  --  in Critic Peter Stitt 's phrase  --  " one of the very great heroes of American poetry " used to drop by Margret Ashbrook 's house and slide his poems across the table for Margret and her mom to see . " He showed us a poem that had the word slob in it , and we told him that was an unpoetic word , " recalls Margret . " But he said that 's how it is , and that 's how he feels , and that 's how it 's gon na stay . We tried all the time to get him to change things , but he was a hard fella to get to change things ; he would n't do it . Jim was out of step with the world even then . " <P> James Wright soon snatched his diploma and left for Kenyon College , eventually wandering far from the gritty industrial town strung along the Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really escaped the place . He could n't . A hypersensitive youth who just happened to be set down amid swirling olive water and factory steam , Wright had had his poetic subject matter handed to him on a dinner plate . He neither forgot nor forgave the misery that he knew . <P> Following college , he began a more or less conventional career of academic jobs in this country , leavened by ruminative sojourns abroad . Martins Ferry continued to haunt him . Toward the end of his life , strolling through the golden sunlight of Italy , he could momentarily be blinded by a memory of the black snowdrifts back home and " the mill smoke that gets everything in the end . " Wright won the Pulitzer Prize for his poetry in 1972 and died of cancer eight years later , at 52 . <P> As champion and scourge of the hardscrabble region where he grew up , Wright evokes a world coated in soot , poverty , kindness and loss . He calls the hilly easternmost part of the state " my back-broken beloved Ohio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the names of his personal malefactors spelled out . This has not always made James Wright the most popular guy around Martins Ferry . <P> It 's difficult to tell about something as subtle and vaporous as a poet 's reputation in a town not much distracted by free verse , in the heart of a republic that shuns poetry like castor oil , but lately the local wind seems to have shifted in Wright 's favor . " I think there 's a great deal of name recognition , " observes John Storck , the youngish head librarian at the Martins Ferry public library and an organizer of the festival convened here each spring in the poet 's honor , " partly because there are still a good number of his classmates around town . One of our trustees played football with James Wright . There 's a feeling of astonishment at how well known he is . " <P> The stage of open animosity has long since passed , says Storck . People realize that Wright 's melancholic work is " not going to be Chamber of Commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're not upset by it . " Wright rarely ventured home to test his luck . He could reach the town best from a distance , through the acid of memory . <P> In a blue rag the old man limps to my bed , <P> Leading a blind horse <P> Of gentleness . <P> In 1932 , grimy with machinery , he sang me <P> A lullaby of a goosegirl . <P> Outside the house , the slag heaps waited .
