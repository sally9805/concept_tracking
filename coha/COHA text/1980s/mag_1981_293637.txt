RABBIT IS RICH by John Updike ; Knopf ; 467pages ; $13.95 <P> Compared with Rabbit , Run ( 1960 ) and Rabbit Redux ( 1971 ) , this third novel about the life and times of Harold C. ( " Rabbit " ) Angstrom seems , at first , uneventful . No infants drown in bathtubs , no houses burn down , leaving innocent dead behind . The year is 1979 . Skylab is falling , gas prices are rising , and Rabbit , 46 , sells Toyotas for Springer Motors , the firm founded by his late father-in-law . His on-and-off marriage to Janice is on again , glumly and apparently for good . They live with her mother and sock away money . Rabbit thinks less and less about his days as a high school basketball star and the B-league scoring record he set in 1951 . Even his formidable libido has begun to show signs of acting its age : " Somewhere early in the Carter Administration his interest , that had been pretty faithful , began to wobble and by now there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stuck in the midlife doldrums , but Rabbit Is Rich positively hums with vitality . As a novelist , John Updike has never seemed more confidently in control of his material : in this case , an eerily representative American soul undergoing a summer and winter of discontent . Catastrophe no longer dogs Rabbit 's heels . He is afflicted instead with dented fenders , with enough money to know that it will not buy him what he wants , whatever that may be . He is in the process of forgetting his dream , just as his city of Brewer in southeastern Pennsylvania has paved over its past with highways that , thanks to oil prices , may lead nowhere . He peddles Japanese cars to Americans ; something has gone wrong in his native land . He thinks : " The world keeps ending but new people too dumb to know it keep showing up as if the fun 's just started . " <P> Out of such statements Updike constructs a poignant comedy of diminished expectations . Some of the laughter arises from the nagging ordinariness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelson , 23 , who comes home with a pregnant fiancee , announces that he does not want to finish his senior year at Kent State and begins angling for a sales job at Springer Motors . Rabbit dislikes Nelson : " I think one of the troubles between me and the kid is every time I had a little , you know , slipup , he was there to see it . " Dodging his son as much as he can . Rabbit quixotically pursues an imagined daughter ; he suspects that a young woman who comes to his car lot is the product of his affair , some 20 years and two novels ago , with a woman named Ruth . <P> The bulk of the action takes place inside Rabbit 's mind , a locale that has become increasingly entertaining . Updike has mastered a supple stream of consciousness that perfectly conveys Rabbit 's darting curiosity . This former high school jock may lack all but the rudiments of an education , but he is one of those , in line with Henry James ' advice , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registers what is playing at the four-theater movie complex ( ALIEN MOONRAKER MAIN EVENT ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ ) ; he listens to disco on the car radio and muses on the accomplishment of the Bee Gees , " white men who have done this wonderful thing of making themselves sound like black women .
