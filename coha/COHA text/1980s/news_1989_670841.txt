The proposal , introduced by Representative Peter J. Visclosky , Democrat of Indiana , would require that corporate pension funds establish a joint board of trustees composed of an equal number of employer and employee representatives . The companies would be required to hold secret-ballot elections that must be certified by an independent third party. // Before such a measure could become law , a comparable provision would have to be introduced in the Senate and passed there. // The House measure would give workers a voice in how the assets are invested , which would have strong implications for the stock and bond markets . But it would not give them control over a company ' s contributions or benefit payments , say Congressional staff members who have worked on the bill . <> <> Business and Labor at Odds // The Visclosky proposal has touched off a battle between labor and business groups during this otherwise quiet August Congressional recess .

" The Visclosky amendment seeks to give substance to the law , and labor strongly supports it. " // But business executives view the move as a back-door attempt by unions to organize workers at corporations , and they strongly oppose it . " I have never seen employers more exercised on an issue than this one , " said Mark J. Ugoretz , the executive director of the Erisa industry committee , whose 125 members represent the nation ' s largest companies . " We want to see this bill dead . " The measure would mandate the same kind of trusteeship of corporate pension plans that already exists in managing the $136 billion in union pension funds . The bill would not affect the assets of state , municipal and local government retirement plans not regulated by the Federal Government. // Roy A. Schotland , a professor of law at Georgetown University who has studied pension funds , advocated employee representation in pension plans .

Disturbed by testimony that pension-fund assests are being used to finance hostile takeovers , Mr. Visclosky , a second-term Congressman , decided that workers should be granted more control over how the assets are invested. // " The money is the workers ' , not the company ' s , " Mr. Visclosky said . " They have an interest in insuring that the wisest investment decision is made. " // Because of its populist appeal , the legislation could be difficult to defeat , some Washington lobbyists say . Besides the 30 million nonunion employees covered by private pension plans , another 15. 3 million union members are covered by the so-called multi-employer pension plans , according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington. // " It is going to be tough to remove it , " said James A. Klein , the deputy executive director of the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans , a business lobbying group in Washington whose 420 members oppose the amendment. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether union members would automatically serve as trustees in cases where companies employ union members . That would depend on how the pension plan is designed , said a member of Representative Visclosky ' s staff . <> <> Strong Lobbying Effort // The battle between the union groups and the business executives is already building . Businesss groups , like the Financial Executives Institute , the Erisa industry committee and the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans , have begun an effort to alert members of Congress to the amendment and to convince them that any move to grant employees control over the assets would be expensive , disruptive and potentially threatening to the retirement system , they say. // " I don ' t think it ' s a desirable change in a system that ' s working very well , " said Fred G. Weiss , the vice president of planning , investment and development at the Warner-Lambert Company , which has $1 billion in retirement assets. // A central issue in the dispute is the question of who controls pension assets . Almost $1 trillion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets taxes are in what are known as defined-benefit plans . Under these plans , companies promise employees a fixed benefit regardless of the investment performance of the assets . The corporate executives contend that because the pension promise is guaranteed by the company , they should have sole control over how the assets are invested . <> <> Detailed Financial Decisions // The executives also say that employees lack the sophistication to handle the complicated financial decisions affecting the investment of these funds . " That clearly is part of the concern of the employers , " said Mr. Klein of the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans. // The union groups contend that the employees should have some control over the funds because they are a form of deferred compensation . They also say that the executives who have channeled the pension funds into leveraged buyouts and high-yielding " junk bond " investments in recent years have not been responsible. // " They haven ' t proved that their track record is exemplary , " Karen Ignagni , an employee-benefits specialist at the A.F.L.-C .
