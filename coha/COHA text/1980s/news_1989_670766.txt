The tritium was produced as an unwanted byproduct of the process by which nuclear weapons material is made in military production reactors at the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina . It is trapped in the heavy water that flows through the reactors to promote the nuclear reaction. // More than three years ago , the Energy Department decided not to build an innovative chemical separation plant to extract the tritium from the heavy water , saying the cost of $90 million was too high . The extraction process , which has been successfully used by other countries , would increase the safety of the reactors by removing the radioactive gas and would create a new source of tritium fuel for weapons . <> <> Lawmaker Denounces Decision // Representative Edward J. Markey , a Massachusetts Democrat who is investigating the tritium shortage , last week called the department ' s decision " appalling , " saying an extraction plant " would not only help us meet weapon requirements but would reduce the environmental and safety hazards at Savannah River. " // At a House hearing Thursday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Defense Programs , said the amount of tritium in the heavy water was relatively " small " compared with what the nation needed and that no plans were under way to remove it for use in nuclear weapons. // James L. Folk Jr. , head of reactor assessment planning at Savannah River , said in an interview that the extraction plant was environmentally attractive but too expensive . " It was never defined as a major safety improvement , " he said . " It was , ' Hey , this would be nice , ' but when people measured it up against other issues , it didn ' t make it. " // To some experts , this untapped source of tritium is now assuming new importance as traditional supplies become increasingly scarce . The only American reactors that make tritium , at the Savannah River Plant , have been shut for safety reasons since April. // A radioactive form of hydrogen , tritium decays by 5. 5 percent a year and must be replenished periodically in nuclear weapons , where it vastly increases destructive power . <> <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Savannah River said last week that the untapped tritium supply in heavy water there amounts to about 2 , 000 grams , which at current prices would sell for $56 million . Experts outside the Government estimate that this tritium , were it all extracted , could create 400 new nuclear weapons or replace the tritium lost annually through radioactive decay in some 7 , 000 warheads. // The Savannah River officials added that the idea of building a plant to extract the tritium was rejected after a 1985 study put its cost at $90 million. // In an interview Mr. Wade , of the Energy Department , said that last year the department had again " examined and eliminated " the idea of an extraction plant . " On one hand , that ' s a fair amount " of tritium , he said , referring to the untapped 2 , 000 grams . " But on the other , it ' s not available in the short term and does represent a significant investment to get it out. " // Congress , worried about impending tritium shortages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new tritium-producing reactors , is now examining whether a plant could be built as an interim step to help ease the nation ' s tritium problems. // The Energy Department says improving the 35-year-old Savannah River reactors so they can be restarted will cost $350 million over two years . Even then , it says , the reactors may not make enough tritium to maintain the nation ' s arsenal of more than 20 , 000 warheads . The two new tritium production reactors that the Administration wants to build , one at Savannah River and one in Idaho , would not be ready for a decade. // Gary Milhollin , director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control in Washington , who has investigated heavy water use at Savannah River , said extracting the untapped supply would be " the cleanest method environmentally to help maintain the arsenal , " adding that it could " substantially reduce " the tritium shortage. // The technology to extract the tritium is innovative but not exotic , experts say . France and Canada have developed the technology because tritium in heavy water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used in some types of reactors to " moderate " or slow speeding neutrons so they are more likely to split heavy atoms in a chain reaction , and tritium is formed as a byproduct . <> <> Concern Over Health Threat // Because tritium in heavy water poses a health threat , French scientists in the late 1960 ' s joined with Sulzer Brothers of Switzerland , an engineering firm , to develop a method to extract it . The plant , in Grenoble , France , uses a super-cold distillation process to remove the tritium. // A much larger $100 million extraction plant was completed last year in Canada by Sulzer Brothers and Ontario Hydro , an electric utility . Ontario Hydro has 16 reactors that use heavy water , and its safety specialists are eager to remove rising levels of tritium from them . Canadian policy does not allow tritium to be extracted from American heavy water for use in nuclear weapons. // Starting in the early 1980 ' s , officials at Savannah River began to study the feasibility of building a tritium extraction plant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the September 1985 issue of Fusion Technology , a technical journal of the American Nuclear Society , P.K. Baumgarten and K.W. Howard of the Savannah River Laboratory said such a plant would " reduce unnecessary dosages " of radiation to people at and near the plant. // The radioactive tritium could escape " by evaporation to the atmosphere , leakage to the river , and intentional purges to seepage basins , " the engineers said , noting that such releases caused 45 percent of the radiation doses to people near the plant. // Alexander Stuecheli , a Sulzer official in Switzerland who aided the 1985 Savannah River study , said in a telephone interview that an added factor in the rejection of the plant , other than cost , was sheer inertia. // Energy Department officials said the 1985 study found that processing all heavy water at Savannah River would take two years and would remove 78 percent of the tritium . Industry experts said last week that newer extraction techniques remove 95 percent of the tritium and do so faster than the plant envisioned for Savannah River. //   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
