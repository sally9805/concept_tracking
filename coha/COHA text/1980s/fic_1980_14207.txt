A theatrical dressing room . A table and chair . Makeup for the evening 's production is laid out on the table . Over the loudspeaker we hear the Stage Manager call , " 15 minutes , please . The call is 15 minutes . " The actress enters hurridly and goes to the table . She wears a kimono over a slip . During the course of the piece she completes her makeup and dresses for the play she is doing . Though not actually present she looks into a mirror and thus directly toward the audience . She speaks to an unseen dressing room partner . ACTRESS Anyway , this guy , the director , actually used a buzzer . ZZZZZZZZZZZ . Really . He would sit there wearing a Yankee 's baseball cap and push this buzzer after each laugh line for as long as he thought the laugh would last . Laugh line , ZZZZZZZZZZZ . This was to train us not to step on the laugh . Can you believe it ? Really . Oh , he trained us , believe me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are waiting for the buzzer .

Last year I did Katrin in Mother Courage for this really dour , silent , unapproachable , East German woman . She sat on a camp stool , immovable , for hours during rehearsal . With her eyes closed yet . No reactions . Really . I felt like a radio show . Anyway , after a week she asks me out for a beer and suggests that we should sleep together to get in tune with the play . I tell her she wants to get in tune with the play she should sleep with the author . She says , My dear , Bertholt has been dead for thirty years !

THE PATCHWORK GIRL OF OZ I spend more and more time in Oz . Since I 've turned thirty-five . Since Suzanne is in high school . This is Scraps . I had a dressmaker do it . It 's not the only one I have . I have Ozma , I have Dorothy , I have Glinda the Good Witch . I 'm even beginning to go out in this stuff . The midnight Rocky Horror Show , St. Patrick 's Day parades . I went down one night to a gay bar and they waved the cover charge . Always as Scraps . My face does n't show . Jack does n't even know I have the books . He sure as hell does n't know I do this . You know about the Patchwork Girl ? It 's the seventh Oz book . She was made from a patchwork quilt by Dr. Pipt , the crooked magician , to be his servant . He sprinkled the " powder of life " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had dumped a bunch of cleverness into the Patchwork Girl 's head . Too much for her to be satisfied as a servant . So she set off for the Emerald City with Ojo and the Transparent Glass Cat with the ruby heart and pink brains and the Living Phonograph . They called her Scraps and sometimes Patches.I wish I was clever . Oh , I know how to hide nail holes with toothpaste , and how to spray cut flowers with hair-fix to make them last longer , but I 've never had a job because I do n't know how to do anything . I mean anything they pay you for . I 'm not too good at learning new things either . I just freeze up or something.God , I loved the Oz books when I was a kid . Do you know the countries ? Well you know the Munchkins . Everybody knows the Munchkins . The Winkies where everything 's yellow . Jack Pumpkinhead , the Tin Woodman , The Scarecrow , they all have their castles there . Gilliken Country , Quadling Country . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I can in downtown Cleveland . When Jack goes I just sit looking out the window for a long time and then I close the drapes and spend the day in Oz . I can clean and stuff and still be there . Jack does n't understand why I put yellow linoleum in the kitchen.Nobody dies in Oz . No matter what 's happening to you Ozma watches on her magic picture and you always get saved . Listen , there are great bad guys ! Old Mombi , The Gnome King , The Skeezers . You think I 'm ill do n't you ? You want to send me to group therapy or self-improvement seminars or off to take night classes towards a law degree . God I hated school ! How could anybody like it ? Hell , you can live a whole life and never have to subtract . Have you noticed that nobody ever talks about anything ? I bet I have n't heard anybody talk about anything in two years . God knows Jack does n't . In the morning he reads me the cereal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would n't think I was so boring if he came home and found me in this . What would he do I wonder ? Call his mother for advice . She 'd tell him to buy me a Cuisinart and an exercycle.I live in Oz . I see it all . I 've even gotten so I can smell it . " Two or three hours walk along this trail brought Ojo and Scraps to a clear level country where there were a few farms and some scattered octagonal houses , all bright Quadling red and smelling of peppermint . " I can live in that sentence for a full 3 hours . You know what ? I like that a lot better than life.Someday I 'll be at the front door when Jack comes home .

You know , those television computer space games ? Asteroids , Space Invaders , Cosmic Cadet . God , I hate the sound of it . They were talking about municipal bonds or something . We were all around the T.V. with the pretzel mix . Jenny , Allen , Marty , Turk , Jack , me . And I went to Oz . I was in trouble and I was being rescued from a whirlpool by this Orka bird with four wings , four legs and a propeller tail , and I guess Jack was talking to me and I did n't answer .

Then they 'll send the Scarecrow to come get me and we 'll ride the Sawhorse all the way back to the Emerald City . We 'll lunch with the Hungry Tiger and the Cowardly Lion . And the Scarecrow will say , " Why here 's a right curious creation , midway between a ragbag and a rainbow . Why my dear , ( She puts the " Scraps " head back on and sings. ) you are quite bedazzling ! " The Scarecrow has the very best brains the Wizard ever made . Perhaps we 'll be married .

LAURIE The day my mother found out she was dying she asked me to go out and buy her these clear glass marbles . Dad and I had n't even known she was ill which was nothing new . Whenever you asked my mother if she was ill she would throw things at you , sesame buns , the editorial page , a handful of hair ribbons . Do not , she would say , suggest things to suggestible people. Anyway , I brought her the marbles and she counted ninety of them out and put them in this old cut-glass bowl which had been the sum total of great Helena 's estate . Apparently , the doctor had given her three months and she set great store by doctors . She said she always believed them because they were the nearest thing to the Old Testament we had . I would n't give you two bits for these young smiley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , stern-furrowed physician. She would n't even have her teeth cleaned by a dentist under fifty . So she counted out ninety clear glass marbles and set them in the bowl on her bedside table . Then she went out and spent twelve hundred dollars on nightgowns . She said , In my family you are only dying when you take to your bed , and that , my darlings , is where I am going. And she did . Oh we hashed it around . Dad said she could n't possibly be dying but the doctors convinced him . I told her it seemed a little medieval to lie in state up there but she said she did n't want to be distracted from what she loved , us , and what she wanted to mullAnd she said there was nothing outside except drugstores and supermarkets and drycleaners and that given her situation they were beneath her dignity . I asked her what she intended to do up there and she said study French , visit with us , generally mull and maybe call a few pals . Study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself years ago that she would die bilingual . Dad and I cried a lot , but she did n't . He was fun to cry with . From then on the doctors had to come see her because , as she put it , she came in with a house call and she was going out with a house call . And all day , every day , she would hold one of these marbles in her hand . Why ? She said it made the day longer . Mother had her own bedroom . That was the way it always was , for as long as I can remember . She called my father The Thrasher. Dad could really get into a nightmare . Apparently early on in the marriage he had flipped over and broken her nose and that was it . Separate beds . Her room was very spare really . Wooden floors , an old steel-and-brass bed , oak dresser , bedside table , and do n't ask me why , a hat rack . No pictures on the walls . She never understood how people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She said it was bound to deflate the imagination. We 'd sit with her after dinner and talk about issues. She told us she was too far gone for gossip or what we ate for lunch . Then we 'd all turn in and in a little while , just before I 'd drift off I 'd hear this ( She rolls one of the marbles across the stage floor . ) Happened every night . After the third or fourth day I saw one on the floor and started to pick it up but she said leave it. She said it very sharply . I asked , How come ? She said she was learning to let go of them. ( From now on the actress frequently rolls marbles across the stage , indicated hereafter by an asterisk , ending up at last with only one . ) Oh , she passed the time . There were things she wanted . She made out a list of children 's books from her own childhood and we got as many of them as we could find from the library . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd ever read. *She wrote notes to , I do n't know , maybe sixty or seventy people , and they told us later on that they were sort of little formal goodbyes , each of them recalling some incident or shared something , not very significant , but the odd thing was that in each one she included a recipe . A recipe in every one of them.We got out the big cookie tin full of snapshots that somehow never became a scrapbook . She liked that . She showed my father how to do the medical insurance and how she handled the accounts . We went through her jewelry. * She wrote down the names of the roofers and plumbers and air-conditioning people . She called it wrapping it up. Well , this is good , she 'd say , I 'm wrapping it up.*She had the television moved up in her room and she called me aside to say that it was entirely possible that she might reach a stage where she really would n't know what she was watching but that I must promise her that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting hard , * she told Dad and me that she would like to spend more time alone . I 'm afraid , she said , that I 'm going to have to do this more or less by myself. She said that she was glad , and she hoped we would be , that this was arranged so that you got less attached to the people you loved at the end . The next period is n't worth going into , it was justhard . ( She picks up the bowl of marbles . ) Do you know that from the very beginning down to the very last she never admitted to any pain . Never . She called it the chills. The last thing she asked for was a picture we had in the front entrance hall of a labrador retriever she and Dad had owned when they were first married . He was , she said , a perfectly dreadful dog . When you are young , she said , you believe in the perfectibility of dogs.I was in bed two weeks ago Wednesday toward dawn , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor . When they have stopped rolling , she speaks . ) Dad and I ran in there . The bedside table was turned over and she was gone . Dead . When the emergency medical people got there they found this ( She opens her hand to disclose one more marble . ) The rest spilled when the table fell , but this one was still in her hand . I keep it. I keep it in my hand all day.It makes the day longer . p. 7 ( Blackout . ) END OF CLEAR GLASS MARBLES p. 8 Act 1 , Scene 4 : Audition AUDITION An actress in her late twenties runs up on the stage .

Momma and I wore look-alike Statue of Liberty costumes that she had to send clear to Nebraska to get and Daddy was there in a T-shirt with my name , April .

Being denied showed me the way , showed me the glory that sits inside life where you ca n't see it.People think you 're a twit if you twirl . It 's a prejudice of the unknowing .

( Breaks focus , identifies person in audience ; focus , pause , line. ) @x The room is filled with lamps . Some are on tables . Some are floor lamps . There would have to be a minimum of a dozen . A woman of sixty-five , nicely dressed , stands among them . They are all on . There is no other theatrical illumination . LILA The older I become , the more I 'm drawn to light . To radiance of all kinds . Both the light and the shadows , they fascinate me . Perhaps it 's a sort of primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark . I 've rented this loft and filled it with lamps . I spend most evenings here . It is both eccentric and childlike , is n't it ? I would prefer to think of it as a kind of playing . The hours fly . I draw enormous energy from it . And there 's the actual heat of course . ( She begins to move through the room . ) I hope I 'm not embarrassing you . May I show you ? It 's delightful to move at random , extending a hand , weaving in and through these pools of warmth . Each lamp gives its heat differently . Unique . And then in between , and there are many betweens , you can receive , feel , several sources at once . Any movement and the balance is changed . And then when you 've exhausted these relationships , why you can change them , do n't you see ? I 'm a littlea little frightened this will bore yousharing thisit 's so difficult to share our enthusiasms do n't you think ? Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Night flying ? Like costume jewelry on velvet . Wet neon . Trees covered with ice under street lamps . I suppose these are sentimental images of my generation . Might I show you something ? It wo n't take a moment . ( She turns several of the lamps off . ) There . Now , moving through . ( She walks a pattern through the lamps . ) Now this . ( She moves again , holding a handled mirror in each hand . ) Now see . ( She turns two or three off and another on . ) I can feel the difference . Acutely . Pleasurably . Is this senility on the hoof ? Look . ( She hunkers down on the floor and looks up . ) Seeing the lights above me makes me laugh . Why , do you suppose ? ( She stands up . ) You probably suspect that it 's a history as well . Of course . Some of these are from the Catsafall Farm . Catsafall , that 's Iowa . Several of these are from family and friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) My husband . Oh , fiddle , they 're all personal . No , I wo n't bore you . Memories , I believe are patterns of a sort . And these , you see , make patterns and are memories . ( She sits in a rocker off to one side . ) I endlessly wondered what older age , later years , would be , feel like . As have you . A diminishment ? A narrowing ? There are so many things one obviously can not do . Many of the people once central to one 's life are gone or dispersed . One is less oftenuseful . My grandfather , when he was very rich in years , used to call himself ' deneeded and unpacked . ' There are necessarily fewer people . Thinking about it , it seemed sensible then to invest more feeling in objects , enrich my relationship to them so that Iso that I was n't without intimacy . I have one sister , Amelia , and she resides in a sort of Leisure World , a planned community in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is very well off . She moved there from Catsafall and tells me that she is ever so busy withactivities . She has many , many friends there she says . Imagine . Amelia has not a single , solitary acquaintance who knew her before she was sixty . There she is , a sort of amnesiac with many friends and no memories , baking herself in the sun like a pop-tart . Quite beyond me . Several years ago she visited me here . She sat there , just where you are , and shared this odd mixture of patterns , heat and memory . I showed her , for instance , how extraordinarily hands take light . Lovely . Well , after a very long silence , a very nice silence really , she rose and said , Lila , you are mad as a March hare. She flew home to a card tournament . ( She stands up behind the one remaining lamp . ) It has been my experience that light is the more pleasurable as you diminish it , and that when a single glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wait for the moment it will be extinguished . It is ever-so-lovely , ever , ever , so . It bewilders and thrills me , this light , radiance , that has become my friend to succor and sustain me . The warmth ! The fascination of the waiting . And then , finally , of course ( She stands above the lamp , illuminated for several seconds and then turns it off . ) ( Darkness. ) p. 15 END OF LAMPS p. 16 Act 2 , Scene 2 : Handler HANDLER A young woman in a simple , country-print dress . On the floor before her is a handmade wooden box about two feet long and eighteen inches high with a sliding wire screen top . CARO My Dada ( Pronounced " Dd-aw. " ) was gon na do this tonight but the Lord froze his face so he sent me . I learned this from my Dada and he learned it up from great Gran , who took it on from the Reverend Soloman Bracewood , who had him a mule ministry ' round these parts way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my brother Jamiehe was in it too , ' fore he went for Detroit.See , what I got in here in snakes . Lotta people do n't like snakes . Gives it its nature , I guess . This here is water mocs . Jamie , he said they got the dirtiest , nastiest bite of allwell , rattlers is yer biggest . Lotta venom . You milk you a rattler , you can half fill up a juice glass . Dada said Jamie should do rattlers , but he never . Did ' heads , copperheads . Now they 're slower and safer but it ai n't such a good show . You know those dang snakes smell like cucumbers ? Well , they do . Miss Ellie , she favored mocassins . Dada toowell , Dada he did all kinds , all ways . Your mocassin now , he 's your good ol ' boy snake . Flat out mean an ' lots of get up n ' go . Heck , they 'll chase ya . They will . Ol ' Dada he did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off them mocs ' fore they lay you down . ' Made Miss Ellie laugh . Lotta handlers think mocassins are slimy . Could n't get me to touch one . They 'll do rattlersgot him a nice dry feel . Little bit sandpapery . Rattler can find ya in the pitch dark though . They git on to yer body heat . Snake handlin . ' All my blood does it . Only Dada an ' me now though . Snake handlin ' , with the Holiness Church . Down where I come from we take God pretty serious . If you got the spirit , snake do n't bite . If he bites you , you know you ai n't got the spirit . Makes the difference real clear , do n't it ? It 's right there in the scriptureMark , Chapter 16 , verses 17 and 18 , ' And these signs shall follow them that believe . In my name they shall cast out devils ; they shall speak in new tongues ; they shall take up serpents ; and if they shall drink any deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay hands on the sick and they shall recover . ' Do n't figure it could be much clearer than that . There 's some churches do n't use snakes , use strychnine , powdered poison , same idea though . They mix it with Cherry kool-ade , sing ' em a hymn , drink it off , and then just stand around waitin ' to see if they fall over . Ai n't much of a show . Not like snakes . Dada does fire but I ca n't do it . Pours some kerosene in a coke bottle , sticks a rag in the top and lights it up . Holds that fire under his chin , passes it down the arm , puts his hand in it , you know , that kind of stuff . He says there 's people do blow torches down to Tennessee . I do n't know . Jamie give it a try ' fore he went to Detroit . Just about burned his ass off . Sorry.When I handle , I keep ' em in this box . Dada gim me this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll just open up the lid and put my foot in or , uh , maybe stick it open side to my chest . There 's some lay it to their face . I do n't . Scares my eyes . Durin ' service we take ' em right out , pass ' em around . It 's more dangerous than a single handler . Snake gets to comparin ' who got the spirit a whole lot an ' who jes got it some . Somebody 's jes about bound to come in second . Do n't get me wrong now . Y ' do n't die everytime yer bit . I been bit seven times . Four times by the same serpent . Dada says he got the sweet tooth for me . Dada been bit thirty-two times an ' never saw him a doctor . Used to let me kiss him on the marks . Last one got him here . ( Points to eye . ) Froze him right up . Dada says he 'll thaw but I do n't know.Day after Jamie took off Miss Ellie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to Hard Burley . Should n't ought to ' cause her mind were n't there . Coal truck backfired and she got bit . Snake bit her three more times ' fore she hit the ground . Dada layed hands on her but she died anyway . There was ten of us handled right there at the funeral . Snake handlin ' . Snake knows what you feel . You can fool a person but you ca n't fool a snake . You got the spirit , God locks their jaws . Keeps you safe . Tell you what thoughI do n't believe in a God . Left me . Gone with Miss Ellie . I was handlin ' when I knew it sure . Snake was jes comin ' on down the line . Marita she yells out , ' The Lord . Lord 's in me and with me . In me and with me . ' Noah he was ululatin ' , talkin ' in tongues . Couple of folks was rollin ' and singing .

There ai n't no God in here at all . ' Bout that time they layed that serpent to me . Felt fussy . Nasty . Just lookin ' for an excuse y'know ? An ' I was an empty vessel , worse nor a pharasee , grist for the mill . My blood went so cold I coulda crapped ice-cubes . Snake knew . Started to get leverage . So I said , ' Snake . You Satan 's hand-maiden . You 're right , there ai n't no God in me . I 'm just a woman , but I 'm the only woman in my Dada 's house and he needs me home . Outta his faith and his need , you lock yer jaws . ' I let that snake feel a child 's pure love and it sponged it up offa my hands and then ol ' wiggley went limp . I tranced it . It was a real good service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Takes snake out of the box . ) Yes , you got to believe . Holiness Church is dead right about that . Make me wonder , you know ? I git to lookin ' at people and wonderin ' if they got anything in ' em could lock a serpent 's jaws . Any power or spirit or love or whatever . I look at ' em and I wonder , could they handle ? Tell you what though , you can see it in a face . You can read it . You look me full in the face it do n't take me 30 seconds . It 's like I was the snake , some ol ' pit viper , an ' I can read yer heart .

She wears a plain , black cocktail dress . On every visible part of her body we see blue and red tattoos . The tattoos include twining snakes , demons , flowers , birds in flight , etc . The left side of her face is without tattoos but bears a single scar about three inches long below the cheek . She holds and sips a glass of red wine . ALAIN Until I was thirty-five there was nothing out of the ordinary , nothing remarkable about my life . My days were very like one of those baroque string quartets . Soothing . Placid . Repetitive . School years without protest or excess . Prom years . Not so much as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer , was heard on the eve of my nineteenth birthday to raise a toast which described me , in a positive way he thought , as ' unsurprising . ' In college , an unexceptional college , I appreciated . Appreciated music . Appreciated art . I was , if memory serves , a major in a subject whose actual point or content now escapes me , cultural geography . Had I died at that time , perhaps of acute boredom let us say , in the school cafeteria , eating peas , it would have been agreed , by all who knew me that my epitaph should read , ' She did as she was told . ' Or blander yet , ' She did as she supposed she might be told . ' I met my husband , Arthur , at a festive tea held to honor the retiring faculty advisor of the Christian Youth Center . He proposed a toast , grapeade I think it was , and we were married two years later after weekly dates shared out among three restaurants of vastly ordinary cuisine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our generation to save ourselves for marriage . We had two children . First a girl and then a boy . Two job transfers . Two homes . Two subdivisions . And then on our 15th anniversary Arthur left me , saying I had nothing further to give . I was , he said , unmarked by life.In the weeks that followed I suffered most because I could not seem to suffer . I became an acolyte to sangria , made brief , nervous forays into singles bars and one evening was walked to my car by a musician who suggested that we make love there in the parking lot , between two yellow lines , as he was , as he so delicately put it , ' between sets . ' Well , I resisted , and much annoyed , he cut me here . I stood , horrified and somewhat embarrassed , at sea in the midst of asphalt , staring at drops of blood on my beige shoes . When the scar , this scar , formed I was astounded to find that for the first time people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And they were not the sort of people that I had known before . Oh no , these were interesting people , people who were not unmarked by life . And my mark , my scar , made me in some way approachable ; this blemish gave me confidence . And it occurred to me then , or very shortly thereafter , that perhaps it might be best to wear our lives upon our skin . And so I do . This serpent is Muhammed Kastapha , who coiled his life around mine and taught me that there are pressures , and dangers , even a sort of degradation so delightful that it seems ungrateful to resist . This bird in flight , horrorstruck , would be my mother . This scythe , the ritual likeness of my musician of the parking lot . This day lily , which blooms , decays and is remembered , is Marian , who instructed me with her death . Taught me with her going .

Because , you see , the best among us have had so many imprints left upon them that it is likeembroidery . And these people , life-engraved , are drawn to each other and pass the time interpreting their signs . And those moments of sharing are the best of life . And this unraveling of hieroglyphs , personally I call it love , lasts only so long as there are marks to read . Then it is gone.Sometimes the unmarked are attracted to me . They starebriefly .
