 | The great tidal wave of 1792 solved problems for one Russian at Three Saints but raised perplexing difficulties for another . Chief Manager Baranov had decided during his first hours at this spot that the location had not been well chosen and that an anchorage to the north would be more advantageous . The site he chose seven months before the wave demonstrated his mind-set , for spiritually and emotionally Three Saints had looked backward toward Russia and its affiliations with the past , while the town of Kodiak would look eastward toward the future and the looming challenges of North America . Three Saints carried an umbilical cord to old Siberia , Kodiak to new Alaska . As he and Zhdanko labored over their plans for the new capital , he asked Kyril : Are you the natural son of Madame Zhdanko , of Petropavlovsk ? ' Adopted . ' Was your father the trader they tell about ? ' My birth father must have been some Russian serving on Lapak Island . My true father , Zhdanko . ' What happened to him ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Walked from Yakutsk to Okhotsk .. I 've done that . ' He was tired , almost worn out , that I could see . When we reached Petropavlovsk , I said : " Father , let 's rest , " but he had always longed to see Kodiak . Wanted to control the peltries here . So we set forth when he was eighty-five . ' ' What happened ? ' On the way he died . We bound him with rocks from the ballast and pitched him into the Bering Sea . Not far from the volcano that guards Lapak Island . As a boy I used to sit with him and watch its glow in the twilight . ' Baranov stopped in his planning , knocked on wood , and said fervently : By the grace of God , I 'd like to see eighty-five . The building you and I could do ! ' The second man whose life was sharply modified by the tidal wave was Father Vasili , for on the mournful day when the sixteen victims of the flood were buried , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yermak Rudenko , for he could not in decency , when so many present knew the truth , embroider that brutal man 's life with platitudes . And even had he been able to exalt charity over reality , he would have been deterred when he looked across the grave to where Sofia Kuchovskaya stood impassively staring at the rumpled soil which would cover her accursed husband . In that accidental glance the young priest saw in vivid flashes the history of this valiant girl : her abandonment on Lapak , her hideous escape in the hold of a ship , the beatings and abuses , her fealty to an old religion , her embracing of the new . She was , he thought , a young woman of crystal character who had allowed nothing to sully her and who had represented the best of an old society that was dying to make way for a new . He saw her firm jaw , the dark knowing eyes , the controlled little body , and finally , as the grave was closed , the irrepressible smile , not in triumph over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episode . He could almost hear her sigh as she looked about as if to ask : Now what ? ' On the day after the funeral Baranov summoned Father Vasili to the ruins of his office to hand him a surprising commission : I consider myself responsible for every human being in these islands , Russian , Creole , Aleut , Koniag , makes no difference to me . ' I feel the same way , Chief Manager . ' But I intend doing something about it . How many children did the tidal wave leave without parents ? ' Fourteen , fifteen at least . ' Start an orphanage for them . This afternoon . ' But I have no funds . The bishop promised .. With you , Vasili , the bishop promises and never delivers . With me , it 's The Company . " You 'll have everything you need , Baranov , " but the money never arrives . ' Then how can I . . . ? ' I will pay . The honor of Russia demands it , and if the gentlemen who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the merchant who runs Kodiak is . ' And forthwith he provided the money for the orphanage out of his own meager salary . I But who 's to run it ? ' he asked the priest , and after some reflection , Vasili remembered how Sofia , during her conversion , had been so deeply moved by his tales of Christ 's care for children , and he said : Sofia Rudenko would be ideal . ' She 's not more than fifteen , just a child , really . ' She 's seventeen . ' I ca n't believe it , ' but when she was sent for , and Baranov asked bluntly : Child , how old are you ? ' she said : Seventeen , ' and he asked : Do you think you could run an orphanage ? ' and she asked : What 's that ? ' When it was explained , she said : Father Vasili told me that Jesus said " Suffer little children to come unto me . " Children are my joy , ' and the Kodiak orphanage was established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , determined to see anything he launched succeed , told Vasili : Get her started properly , ' and the young priest maintained supervision , teaching her the rudiments of her new job and instructing the orphans in their new religion . As he worked close to Sofia he was encouraged by the enthusiastic manner in which she became mother to the infants , older sister to the girls and boys . She was so influential with the youngsters that an older Aleut told Baranov : If she was a man , she 'd be our new shaman , ' but Sofia knew this was not accurate , for a real-life shaman had slipped into the remnants of Three Saints in an effort to keep the Aleuts away from Christianity , but his magic now seemed shabby , and compared with the spiritual miracles that Sofia at her orphanage and Father Vasili in his improvised church were accomplishing , he achieved nothing and left . As Sofia worked at the orphanage , Vasili had repeated opportunities to observe how she was maturing as she entered her new life , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious , yet always ready to burst into her warm smile . She was industrious , but available for rough-and-tumble  | play with her children , and above all , she made people of whatever age or racial background happy in her presence . And in the way that happens with certain fortunate women , as she approached her twenties she grew more lovely , more complete . A full inch taller now , her face less rounded , the whalebone labret slightly less conspicuous , she was what one visiting sea captain called : That adorable lass , ' and one evening as Father Vasili left the lively warmth of the orphanage and walked under the stars to the bleak building serving as his church , he looked up at the shaman 's spruce and cried aloud : I was never meant to be a black . I 've been in love with her since the day I stepped on this island . ' He interpreted it properly as an inevitable development and in no manner as shocking as it would have been had he served in the Roman Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedication ; in the Orthodox branch , as he had observed in the case of his own father , far more than half the priests were whites who had married with the encouragement of their bishops , who , even though they were black and celibate , preached : ' Marriage is the normal condition of man . ' To switch from black to white involved a change only in direction , not faith . But even such a limited switch was not easy to accomplish , so on the day that Three Saints shut down , with all Company work moving to Kodiak , Vasili went to talk with Baranov , who was packing the one small box which held the few possessions he had been able to accumulate in the colony . Chief Manager , I seek a boon . ' Granted . No manager ever had a better clergyman . ' I want you to write to my bishop in Irkutsk . ' He wo n't give you a kopeck . You 'll have to make do . ' I want him to release me from my vows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Your parents .. No ! No ! I want to cease being a black . I seek to be a white . ' Baranov sat heavily upon his box and stared at the young cleric , and after a very long silence , he said in a voice so low that Vasili could scarcely hear : I 've been watching you , Vasili , and I know your problem . I know because I too have fallen in love with an island woman . And I shall take her as my wife . ' Shocked by such a confession , the young man became once more a monitory priest : Aleksandr Andreevich , that 's a terrible thing to say . You have a wife in Russia . ' True , and she says she may join me one of these days , but she 's been saying that for twenty-three years . ' Aleksandr Andreevich , if you commit bigamy , I shall have to report you to St. Petersburg . ' I 'm not going to marry her , Father Vasili , just take her for my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a low voice : Which will be never , and I can not live alone . ' Vasili , who had come to consult about his problem , found himself engulfed in Baranov 's : She 's a wonderful woman , Vasili . Speaks Russian , has dutiful parents , is neat in the house and can sew . She promises she 'll take the Russian name Anna and attend our church regularly . ' Looking up from his box , his round face beaming , he asked : Have I your blessing ? '  | There was no way this young priest could sanction such cavalier treatment of the marriage vow , but on the other hand , to untangle his own affairs he had to have Baranov 's letter to the bishop , so he temporized : Will you write to my bishop ? ' and by this digression he let it be known that he would not publicly castigate Baranov if the latter took a common-law wife : After all , Chief Manager , I 'm not leaving the church . I just want to switch from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Yes . ' ' I ' 11 write . If I was younger , I 'd take her myself . ' But then he broke into such irreverent laughter that Vasili blushed , thinking that Baranov was making fun of him . He was , but not in the way Vasili feared . Remember what you said when I wanted Sofia 's marriage to Rudenko annulled ? ' And now he gave a good imitation of the serious young priest : " A vow is a solemn engagement undertaken in the sight of the Lord . There is no way I could annul it . " Well , my young friend , you 're certainly eager to annul your own vows . ' Vasili blushed again , so deeply that Baranov snapped his fingers at having made a discovery : You have n't asked her yet , have you ? ' and Vasili had to confess that he had not . Come along ! ' the energetic manager cried . We do it now . ' And on his stout little legs he ran to the orphanage , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vasili 's hand in his , he said : Since I think of myself as your father , I must inform you that this young fellow has asked for your hand in marriage . ' Sofia did not blush , or at least if she did , it was not visible through her golden skin , but she did bow , keeping her head down until she heard her priest saying softly : I labored to save your soul , Sofia , but equally to save you . Will you marry me ? ' She now knew enough to understand the meaning of his black robes , which she reached out to take between her fingers : What of this ? ' and he said : I have thrown it off as you threw off your sealskin dress when you became a Christian , ' and , with a smile that swept her face , she said : I would be proud . ' Since two or three years sometimes elapsed between the arrival and departure of a ship at Kodiak , there could be no quick response to Vasili 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if permission had been obtained , it might be another three years before a priest arrived to conduct a wedding , so Baranov made a practical proposal : If I 'm going to live with Anna as my wife , you should do the same with Sofia . . . that is , until a priest can come to straighten things out . ' I could n't do that . ' But then Baranov cited the ruling theology of the distant Aleutians : The tsarina 's in St. Petersburg , and God 's high in the heavens , but we 're here on Kodiak , so let 's do what 's necessary . ' In this bizarre manner the two leaders of Russian America , old manager , young priest , took their island wives . Cidaq Sofia Kuchovskaya Rudenko Voronova would become the mother of that later Voronov who would illuminate Russian America and bring into fruition Baranov 's dreams . The gifted Anna Baranova would serve as the chief manager 's mistress for years and give birth to two excellent children , one of whom would become the  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of the real Madame Baranova , never seen in Siberia or the islands , Anna would become Baranov 's legal wife , whom he presented to all as the daughter of the former king of Kinai . ' Visitors found no difficulty in accepting this legend , because she was indeed queenly . In the protracted battle between shamanism and Christianity , the latter won , but it was a murderous victory , for when Vitus Bering 's men first stepped ashore on the Aleutians in 1741 , the islands contained eighteen thousand , five hundred healthy men and women who had adapted masterfully to their treeless but sea-rich environment . When the Russians departed , the total population was less than twelve hundred . Ninety-four percent had been starved , drowned , forced into slavery , murdered , or otherwise disposed of in the Bering Sea . And even those few who survived , like Cidaq , did so only by merging themselves into the victorious civilization .  | ITHIN THE SHADOW OF THE LOVELY VOLCANO THAT guarded Sitka Sound , the Great Toion lay dying . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which comprised his domain and had brought order among the headstrong , sometime mutinous Tlingit Indians , who were reluctant to follow the lead of anyone . They were a powerful lot , these Tlingits , resembling in no way the more placid Eskimos of the far north or the gentle Aleuts of the island chain . They loved warfare , enslaved their enemies when possible , and were afraid of no man , so that after the Great Toion died , relinquishing the power he had accumulated so craftily , the Tlingits knew that there might be a period of confusion , warfare and sudden death before the next toion proclaimed and established himself . When the big slave known as Raven-heart became aware that his master was dying , panic captured him , for he realized that the very strengths which had made him the prime slave of the toion  --  his bravery in war , his alertness in defending his master  --  would condemn him to death , for when a toion ( lied , it was the custom among the Tlingits to kill almost at that instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him properly in the world 1 beyond the mountains . And since Raven-heart was by any judgment supreme among the toion 's slaves , he would be awarded the honor of being t he first to have the back of his neck stretched across the ceremonial log , while a smaller log , held by four men , was pressed down upon the front of his neck until life was crushed out  --  strangling him without marring his body for use in the next world .  | The big fellow had never before been afraid . His history was one of constant struggle against odds , and in the mainland valley which his clan occupied he had been a principal defender against enemies who tried to invade from the higher lands to the east . He became known as a champion , the one on whom the valley Tlingits depended for their protection and their freedom , and even when the more powerful Tlingits from Sitka Island , led by the Great Toion , invaded in their canoes , sweeping all before them , when they came up against Raven-heart and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required two dozen of the invaders four bruising days to overcome Raven-heart 's men . Three of his companions died in the battle , and he would have been among the dead except that the toion himself commanded : Save that one ! ' and he was entangled in vines cleverly thrown about him , immobilized , and hauled before the victorious chief , who asked : Your name ? ' Seet-yeil-teix , ' he replied in a surly manner , using three Tlingit words that meant spruce-raven-heart , and when the toion heard that his conspicuous captive was a Raven he smiled , for he himself was an Eagle , and although this implied natural competition against the Ravens , he had to acknowledge that a warrior , if he was a good Raven , could be exceptionally clever and formidable . How did you win your name ? ' he asked , and his captive replied : I was trying to jump from this rock to that , fell into the stream . Wet and angry , tried again . Fell again . This time very angry , tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something from a spruce limb . Slipped backward , tried again . And my father shouted : " You 're the raven . " ' The third time , did you make the jump ? ' No . And the raven failed too . When I was bigger I jumped , and my name remained . ' Because of his unusual persistence , he had been valuable to his tribe when unusual tasks confronted them , and he succeeded so often that he acquired a daring approach to everything , whether in battling other clans in actual warfare , or in building a house , or decorating it with the proper totems when it was completed . It was this daring which had led to his capture , for when the Great Toion 's army moved against Raven-heart 's clan , the latter led the defensive sorties and raced so far ahead of his supporters that he was easily surrounded . Now , as the toion gasped away his final moments , making death for Raven-heart inevitable , the captive made his boldest move . Slipping away from the wood-and-wattle big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Raven-heart moved carefully among the six tall totem poles that marked the place and edged toward the heavily forested area to the south . Cautiously he endeavored to slip into the deeper part of the forest , but was prevented by the noisy arrival of sixteen mourners coming from that direction . Jumping nimbly behind a large spruce , he heard them pass , lamenting the approaching death of their leader , but when they were gone , he leaped onto the path they had been following and dashed headlong into the saving comfort of the tall trees and the shady glens they protected . Once safe among the spruce , he began to run with an almost demonic fury ,  | for his strategy required that he be removed as far as possible when the old man died . He reasoned : If they ca n't find me at that moment , they ca n't kill me then . Of course , if they catch me later , they will kill me for having run away . But I have one good chance . If I can find an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was busy bartering , and they 'll have to believe that . This strategy was not irresponsible or ill-founded , because he was one of the Tlingits who had learned enough rudimentary English to conduct trade negotiations with the Americans , whose ships stopped in Sitka Sound with considerable frequency . So as he ran , he began calling silently upon those ships he remembered servicing with deer meat and fresh water when the Americans had come for peltries : White-Dove , come flying . J.B. Kenton , help me . Evening Star , shine to guide me . But now the bad weather for which Sitka was famous descended like a feathery blanket , gray , thick and hanging but a few feet above the earth and the surface of the bay . It quickly became impenetrable , and any chance Raven-heart might have had of saving his life by attaching himself to some trader vanished , and for three agonizing days he hid among the spruce trees along the edge of the bay , waiting for the fog to lift . On the evening of the third day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a muffled sound which electrified him . It seemed to be the firing of a cannon such as mariners used to create echoes from which they could deduce their approximate distance from the looming peril of rocky shores , but it was not repeated as would have been the case had this been such a probing shot . On the other hand , the cannon fire might have been so effective that only one shot was required , and with this hope to feed on he fell asleep in the lee of a fallen spruce . In the early dawn he was awakened by the raucous voice of a raven , and no better signal from the other world could have been devised , because all Tlingits , from the beginning , had been divided into two moieties , the Eagle Clan and the Raven , and every human being on earth belonged to one or the other . Raven-heart was of course a Raven , which meant that he must defend that moiety in games between the two clans and in contests of a more serious kind , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bringing in of fish . As a Raven , he must marry only an Eagle , a provision established thousands of years earlier to protect the cleanliness of the race , but the child of a Raven man and a woman Eagle was an Eagle , and as such , was dedicated to the furtherance of that clan . There was a belief among the Tlingits , and he subscribed to it , that although Eagles were apt to be more powerful , Ravens were by far the wisest , the wittiest and the cleverest in utilizing nature or in winning advantages over adversaries without recourse to fighting . It was known that mankind received water , fire and animals to feed upon through the cleverness of the First Raven , who outsmarted the primordial protectors of those boons to mankind . All the good things were kept apart , ' his mother 's brother had told him , and we lived in darkness , cold and hunger until the  | First Raven , seeing our sorrow , tricked the others into letting us share these good things . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he knew it was a signal that some rescue ship lay in the bay , and he ran to the water 's edge expecting to see the vessel which might have fired the cannon the night before , if that was indeed the sound he had heard . But when he stared into the fog he saw nothing , and in his disappointment he could feel the crushing log upon his throat . Disconsolate and starving , he leaned against a spruce and glared at the invisible bay , still shrouded in gray , and in his extremity , very close to death , he again pleaded silently with the American ships to show themselves : Nathanael Parker , help me . Jared Harper , come close to save my life . Silence , then the sound of iron against wood , and the arrival of a vagrant breeze which moved the fog a little ; then , mysteriously , as if some powerful hand were drawing aside a curtain , the revelation of a shiplike form , followed by its quick submersion in the shifting mist . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger he placed himself in by revealing his position to searchers who might be trailing him , he ran to the shore and knee-deep into the water , crying in English : Ship ! Ship ! Skins ! ' If anything could lure the Americans , assuming they were Americans , to shore , it would be the promise of otter skins , but there was no response . Edging deeper into the water , in which he could not swim , he cried again : Good Americans ! Otter skins ! ' Again there was no response , but now a stronger gust of wind swept aside the fog , and there , not two hundred yards away , miraculously safe amid the dozen tree-studded islands that protected Sitka Sound , lay the Boston trader Evening Star , with which he had traded in the past . Captain Corey ! ' he shouted , dashing into the waves and flailing his arms , and making such a commotion that someone on the brig had to see him . An officer put a glass upon him and called to the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lowered and four sailors rowed it hesitantly shoreward . When Raven-heart , overjoyed at being saved , waded forward to meet it , he found himself facing two rifles pointed right at his chest and heard the stern command : Stand , or we fire ! ' Captain Miles Corey of the trader Evening Star , fifty-three years old and Pacific-hardened , having known too many commanders who had lost their ships , did not take any risks , anywhere , at any time . Before leaving the Evening Star in the skiff , the sailors had been warned : It 's one Indian . But there could be fifty lurking in those trees . ' Stand , or we fire ! ' the men repeated , and as Raven-heart froze , waistdeep in water , one of the four shouted : My God , it 's Raven-heart , ' and he reached out his paddle so that the Tlingit with whom he had traded before could make his way into the boat . It was a gala reception that Captain Corey and First Mate Kane arranged for their old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicament which had sent him alone into the forest . You mean , ' Captain Corey asked , that you 'd have been killed ? Just because the old man died ? ' In his broken English , Raven-heart pleaded with them : You say me on ship four days , eh ? You say fog too much , eh ? Four days . '  | Why is four days so important ? ' Kane asked , and Raven-heart turned to explain . The two men were of about the same size , each a muscular , fearless brawler , and for that reason Kane , the former harpooner , was attracted to the Tlingit , who explained : I suppose to be killed three days ago . Suppose run away , catched , killed now . But if I on ship , trading with you . . . ' By lifting his hands as if relieving them of bonds , he indicated that with such an excuse he might be spared . The omnipresent Sitka fog had once more descended upon the Evening Star , this time so heavily that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deck , so Corey and Kane assured the endangered slave : We 'll probably be in this soup two more days . You 're safe . ' And to celebrate they broke out a bottle of good Jamaican rum , and there , in Sitka Sound , protected by the volcano and the circle of unseen mountains , they reveled . When Raven-heart felt the fine dark liquid exciting his throat , he relaxed and told the Americans of the many pelts he had helped assemble for them , and they were so pleased by this intelligence that they in turn showed him the goods that they had brought from Boston to enrich his Tlingits . These are the casks of rum , ' Captain Corey said , indicating the eighteen barrels stowed in safety belowdecks , and what do you suppose these are ? ' Raven-heart , with a copper ring through the septum of his nose , studied the dozen squared-off rectangular wooden cases , and said : Me not know , ' whereupon Corey ordered a sailor to draw the nails  --  And save them ' ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in oil-soaked rags , lay nine beautiful rifles , and below them , in similar ranks of nine , twenty-seven others . These twelve boxes , packed in orderly manner by the gunsmiths of Boston , contained four hundred and thirty-two first-class long-barreled rifles , and the kegs stowed behind had enough powder to last two years , along with supplies of lead for bullets and molds in which to make them . Raven-heart , satisfied that no one could order him killed if he brought such power to his captors , smiled , grasped Captain Corey 's hands , and thanked him profusely for the tremendous boon the Bostonians were bringing the Tlingits : rum and guns . A minor offshoot from the powerful Athapascans who populated interior Alaska , northern Canada and much of the western United States , the Tlingits were a collection of about twelve thousand unique Indians who had moved far south into what would later he Canada and then fishhooked back north into Alaska , with their own language and customs . Divided into various clans , they occupied the southern littoral of Alaska and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excellent land surrounding Sitka Sound on the island of that name . The people of the dead toion had chosen for their center a conspicuous promontory in the sound , one which rose to a small hill that dominated everything . It was an excellent site , surrounded by at least a dozen rude mountains that formed a protective semicircle to the east , with the majestic cone of the volcano standing as beacon to the west . But as the Russian Baranov had learned when he first saw the sound some years before , one  | of its most attractive features was the horde of islands , some no bigger than a tea table , others of considerable size , which speckled the surface of the water , breaking up surging storm waves that would otherwise have roared in from the Pacific . When the fog finally lifted , Captain Corey gingerly threaded his Evening Star through the islands , bringing her some hundred yards from the foot of the hill , and fired a cannon to inform the Indians that he was prepared to trade with them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Americans found themselves in a predicament . Ever since the ambushing of Captain Cook in the Hawaiian Islands , captains and crews had remained on their trading ships and invited natives to come aboard with their goods , while sailors armed with rifles maintained watch . However , at Sitka the Tlingits were preoccupied with burying their Great Toion , so the Americans launched a longboat , and with Raven-heart perched in the prow , they ignored custom and rowed ashore . At first , the grieving Tlingits waved them away , but when those in charge of the ceremony saw the slave Raven-heart standing amongst the visitors , they announced that they had spent the last five days seeking him as one of the three slaves to be slain so as to provide the toion with servants in the next world . When Captain Corey and First Mate Kane realized that the Tlingits were determined to take Raven-heart from them and put him to death , they indicated that they would not allow this , but since they had only four sailors in the boat , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them if they tried to make a serious protest . So with a sense of sinking shame at abandoning a good man who had placed his life in their care , they made no further objection when some of the elders seized Ravenheart and started hauling him to the ceremonial log . But now an important man in Tlingit history stepped forward , the bold young chieftain Kot-le-an , a tall , sinewy fellow in his early thirties , dressed in shirt and trousers made from choice pelts and draped in a decorated white tunic of deerskin . About his neck he wore a chain made of shells and on his head the distinctive hat of the Tlingits , a kind of inverted funnel from the top of which streamed six ornate feathers . Like Raven-heart , he had a slim copper ring in his nose , but his brown-red features were made distinctive because of his drooping black mustache and neatly trimmed goatee . In height , slimness and mien he was visibly differentiated from the other Indians , and in voice , determination and willingness to act he displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and principal aide to the toion . The six Americans had not encountered Kot-le-an on previous trips to Sitka , for he had been absent on punitive forays against troublesome neighbors , but even had he been present they would probably not have met with him , because he felt that trade was beneath him . He was a warrior , and it was in this capacity that he now stepped forward to prevent the execution of Raven-heart . In words that the Americans did not understand and which were not interpreted for them , since Raven-heart had previously provided that service , the young chieftain voiced a decision that would soon prove to have been prophetic : One of these days we shall have to protect our land  | from either the Americans like these here today or Baranov 's Russians gathering strength in Kodiak . As your leader in battle , I shall need men like Raven-heart , so I can not let you take him . ' ' But the Great Toion also needs him , ' several of the old men cried . ' It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oratory or extended debate , responded by nodding to the elders , then ignoring them and grasping Raven-heart by the hand , pulling him free of both the Americans and the funeral managers : ' This one I must have for when the battles begin , ' and in this abrupt manner the life of the big Tlingit was saved . The Americans then watched with horror as two male slaves , young men in their teens , were dragged down the hill to the seashore , where their heads were held under water until they strangled . Unmarred , their corpses were t hen hauled back up the hill and placed ceremoniously beside the dead body of the Great Toion , whereupon four of the stoutest Tlingits grabbed the slave who had been selected to replace Raven-heart , stretched him across the sacrificial block of wood , and placed across his neck a slim driftwood log , pressing it down until all twitching in the body ceased . Sadly , as if mourning the loss of a friend , they placed this third body across the toion 's feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their chief could proceed . After the funeral ceremony was concluded , trading for the pelts collected by the Tlingits proceeded , and ten of the eighteen barrels of rum were exchanged , under the mediation of Raven-heart , for seal pelts . No sea otters , the fur that China , Russia and California wanted , were in evidence , and it looked as if the Evening Star would have to sail without trading the guns , which the Tlingits really sought . However , just as Captain Corey was about to give the signal ' Haul anchor ! ' Raven-heart and Kot-le-an drew up to the ship in a small wooden rowboat recently built in imitation of those used by American ships , and when the two men were aboard the Evening Star , Raven-heart showed the young chief who had saved his life the dozen boxes containing the guns , telling him in Tlingit : ' There they are . The guns you need . ' Kot-le-an , spotting immediately the box whose top had been removed earlier to show Raven-heart the guns , pulled the loose boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown stocks . Even had the guns had no practical purpose , they would have been beautiful , but as rifles capable of protecting the Tlingits from would-be invaders , they became objects of immense importance . ' I want them all , ' Kot-le-an said , but when this was interpreted , Captain Corey demurred : ' We trade only for sea otter . ' When this was translated , Kot-le-an found it impossible to control his rage . Stamping the deck with his moccasined feet , he shouted : ' Tell him that we have enough men to take the guns ! ' but before Raven-heart could speak , ( ' orey grabbed Kot-le-an by the arm , swung him about to indicate the four cannon on the port side pointing directly at the houses atop the hill , and then to the four on the starboard , which could be pivoted around . ' And tell him , ' he snarled , ' that we have one aft and one forrard , ten in all . '  | Translation was not necessary , for Kot-le-an knew what cannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen into dispute with Tlingits on the mainland , had lost a sailor in a brawl , and in retaliation had bombarded the offending village until only one house remained standing , and Kot-le-an knew that American whalers were even quicker to exact vengeance . Capitulating to Captain Corey 's superior strength , he instructed Raven-heart : Tell him in five days , many otter pelts . ' When Corey saluted this information , as if Kot-le-an were the ambassador of a sovereign power , the Tlingits withdrew , and as they departed First Mate Kane assured them : We 'll wait five days . ' Within the hour the Americans saw numerous small boats set forth from Sitka Sound to visit outlying settlements , and during the next days they watched them returning much deeper in the water than they had been when departing . We 'll be getting some otter pelts , ' Corey assured his men , but even as he prepared to leave ship he ordered Kane : While Kot-le-an can see , train half our cannon on the hill , half on the shore where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Kot-le-an , watching these preparations , was satisfied that no surprise attack from his side was going to succeed , but he also knew that the Americans , having come so far from Boston , could not return with an empty hold . They needed furs as badly as he needed guns , and from this pragmatic base the barter proceeded . When Corey stepped ashore and saw the enormous number of pelts assembled under duress , he realized that whereas the sea otter might be extinct in the Aleutians , the Pribilofs and Kodiak , it was still swimming vigorously in these southern waters , and at the end of two hours of close inspection , he saw that he could with great profit to his ship dispose of his entire dozen cases of guns . So the deal was struck : Tell Kot-le-an I will give him all the guns . You saw them , four hundred and thirty-two . But I want all these pelts and this many more . ' Pulling aside nearly a third of the pelts , he indicated that this was the requirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new demand . As a warrior , the young chief did not relish bartering , he was more used to command , but his apprehensions about the future were so strong that he knew he must have those guns the Evening Star carried , so with a gesture which astonished Corey , in a low voice he issued orders to his men , who moved aside a beached boat to disclose a hidden cache of otter pelts half again as large as the additional demand being made by Corey . Showing his contempt , he started kicking the skins toward the pile already belonging to Corey , and when he had thus moved some dozen pelts he growled to Raven-heart : Tell him he can have them all . ' When the precious cargo was safely stowed upon the Evening Star , with a value many times the cost of the guns , Kot-le-an and Corey stood facing each other , and in a formality which the Tlingit had learned from English captains , he held out his right hand , and Corey took it . But the American was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of this barter that on the spur of the moment he told Raven-heart : Tell Kot-le-an that because he gave us extra fur , we shall give him extra lead and powder , ' and he ordered his sailors to bring forth a substantial chunk of lead and nearly half a barrel of powder .  | With warm feelings on both sides , the deal was concluded , and two days after the Evening Star sailed from Sitka with a fortune in otter skins to be traded in Canton for twice what Corey had calculated , the prudence of Kot-le-an in making this lopsided deal was confirmed . A small armada of Russian ships and Aleut kayaks came into the bay , passed insolently beneath the hill where the local Tlingits kept their headquarters , and threaded its way eight miles to the north , where , in a spot which seemed to be completely surrounded by protecting mountains , they proceeded to unload the material required for the building of a major fort . The armada , headed by Chief Administrator Aleksandr Baranov , was not a trivial one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives and nine hundred Aleuts to Sitka with the avowed purpose of establishing here the capital of Russian America , from which the mainland north of California could be developed as a major Russian holding . On 8 July 1799 , Baranov led his people ashore , and his aide Kyril Zhdanko planted a Russian flag in the loamy soil beside a gently flowing river . Then Baranov asked Father Vasili Voronov , who had come with him to serve as spiritual mentor of the new capital , to offer thanks to God that although the long trip across the open ocean from Kodiak had experienced grave difficulties  --  scores of Aleuts dying from poisoned fish , hundreds perishing at sea  --  the Russians themselves had completed it safely , and that was what mattered . Prayers said , the chubby little master of Russian imperialism stood uncovered , wiped his bald head , and proclaimed : As the old century draws to a close and a bright new one , full of promise , is about to begin , let us apply all our energies to the building of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian America . ' With that , in a loud voice he christened the fort-that-was-to-be Redoubt St. Michael , ' and Sitka 's Golden Age was under way . When Kot-le-an and his aide Raven-heart saw the Russian armada creep past their hill at the southern portion of the bay , their first impulse was to muster all the Tlingit troops and engage in whatever activities might prove necessary to repel the invaders and prevent them from landing , whatever t heir intentions . But when Kot-le-an took the first steps to put this plan into effect , a curious relationship , which would govern the rest of Raven-heart 's life , came into operation . Tell me what to do , ' he said to Kot-le-an , and by this statement he meant that whatever order was issued at any time , he was prepared to execute it regardless of danger to himself , because , as he said , ' I am already dead . The log is across my throat . I breathe only at your pleasure . ' ' So be it , ' the young chieftain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their positions and strength . ' So Raven-heart , keeping to the woods , crept up the eight miles to Redoubt St. Michael and set up an observation post , from which he took careful note of the Russian potential : Three ships , not strong like Evening Star but many , many more men than the Americans . About a thousand  | men , but only one in ten are Russian . The others , what can they be ? He studied the non-Russians with care , reasoning that they could not be Tlingits or from any clan associated with the Tlingits : They 're shorter , darker . They wear bones through their noses and some of them have that strange sloping hat . He noticed two favorable aspects : They know how to make boats and none of our people can handle paddles the way they do . He decided that in a fight on the water , these little men would be formidable , and that with eight or nine hundred such fighters in support of the three big ships , the Russians would give a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rumor had swept through the islands in recent years that these men of Kodiak were able warriors , to be avoided if possible , but before he reported this to Kot-le-an he wanted to assure himself as to the facts , so one night when the moon was gone , he crept close to where the outlines of the fort had been dug and waited in the darkness till one of the workmen wandered out . With a leap and a big hand about the man 's face , he dragged the man back into the trees , where he gagged him with a handful of spruce needles and bound him with sinew thongs . Sitting on him till daylight , he then hefted him across his shoulders like a bundle of pelts and marched back to Sitka Hill with him . There , others who were familiar with the languages of the Bering Sea identified the workman as an Aleut , and when they interrogated him they learned that he had been born on Lapak Island and had been taken as a slave to Kodiak . He revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When asked : Are your people happy to be working here ? ' he replied : It 's better than the Seal Islands . ' Satisfied by further scouting that the cadre really was Aleut , Kot-le-an and Raven-heart decided that an attack in total force stood a good chance of driving off the Russians , for , as Kot-le-an pointed out , If the others were all from Kodiak , it might be difficult , but we know that in battle we can overpower Aleuts . ' And an attack would have been mounted except that , to Kot-le-an 's astonishment , the new toion , without adequate discussions among the warriors of his tribe , not only arranged a peace treaty with the Russians but actually sold them a portion of land at and around the growing fort . Enraged by this supine surrender to what he properly perceived as a mortal threat to Tlingit aspirations , Kot-le-an assembled all who were disgruntled with this invitation to Russian interference in ancient ways , and harangued them : Once the Russians fix their fort on this bay , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . They will never let go , and before we know it , they will demand this hill and this portion of the bay . They 'll want the island there and the volcano and our hot baths and the shore beyond . All the otters will belong to them , not us , and for every American ship that comes here now to trade with us and bring us the things we need , six of theirs will come , and not for trade . With guns they 'll steal everything we have .  | I am not happy with what I see as our fate if we let them stay unchallenged . Our totems will crumble . Our canoes will be driven from the bay . We will no longer be masters of our lands , for the Russians will smother us everywhere and in everything we want to do . I feel the terrible hand of the Russians pressing down upon us like the log that presses upon the throat of a condemned slave . I hear our children speaking not our language but theirs and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our souls will be lost to wander forever in the forests and the moaning will never end . I see these islands changed , and the seas lifeless , and the skies angry . I see the imposition of strange orders , new enforcements , totally different ways of life . And above all , I see the death of Tlingits , the death of all we have fought for through the years . ' I its words were so powerful , and so predictive of the future which many of his listeners were beginning to fear , that he might have enlisted hundreds in his drive to eliminate the Russians and their Aleut allies had not the leader of the Russians , this little man Baranov , anticipated such a ground swell . On a day in August , as summer was beginning to fade , this clever Russian , always attentive to the safety of his flanks , got in his biggest ship and had his sailors bring him down the bay to the Tlingit settlement , and as he approached the landing , where sailors carried him ashore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiance , so that he climbed the hill the first time on a day as beautiful as this part of Alaska provided . It 's an omen , he said to himself , as if he could foresee that he would spend the glory years of his life atop this fortuitous hill , and when he reached the lofty summit , with the new toion coming forth to greet him , he stopped , looked in all directions , and saw as if in a revelation the incredible majesty of this spot . To the west swept the Pacific Ocean , visible beyond the hundred islands , the highway back to Kodiak , out to the far Aleutians and on to Kamchatka and the ramparts of Russia . To the south rose a squadron of mountains , marching backward in file to the end of the horizon , green then blue then misty gray , then almost white in the far distance . To the east , crowded close in , stood the glory of Sitka , the mountains that dipped their toes in the sea , big and powerful but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of infinite variety , of changing color , of surprising height to be so close to the sea . And to the north , where he was already building , he saw that splendid sound , island-dotted , ringed with its own mountains , some as sharp as needles carved from whalebone , others big and comfortable and rounded . He was so enchanted by the rich variety of this scene from the hill that he was tempted to cry out at its wonder , but his Russian merchant 's canniness warned him not to reveal how struck he was lest his Tlingit hosts fathom his interest in their paradise . Dropping his head and keeping his arms folded across his belly , as was his custom , he merely said : Great and Powerful Toion , in appreciation for your many kindnesses in helping us to  | establish our little fort on your bay , I bring you a few humble gifts . ' And motioning to the sailors who accompanied him , he had them unroll bundles which contained beads , brass , cloth and bottles . After these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de resistance  --  and he called it by just those words in French  --  and they produced a somewhat rusty , out-ofdate musket , which he handed gravely to the toion , asking one of the sailors to provide powder and ball plus an exhibition of how the old gun should be fired . When the sailor had everything in order , he showed the toion how to handle the gun , apply his forefinger to the trigger , and discharge the ball . There was a flash of fire as the excess powder burned away , a feeble blast from the end of the gun , and a slight rustle of leaves as the ball bounced its way harmlessly through the treetops below the hill . The toion , who had never before fired a gun , was excited , but Kot-le-an and Raven-heart , who had nearly five hundred first-class new rifles hidden away , smiled indulgently . However , it was canny Baranov who seemed to triumph , for in response to these impressive gifts , offered with such voluntary good will , he was given the loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and supervise the Aleuts in catching and drying the multitude of salmon which had begun streaming into the small river to the north of the fort . Kot-le-an , infuriated by this easy capitulation of his toion to the blandishments of the strangers , did gain one advantage : he insinuated into this group of temporary workers his man Raven-heart , so that when Baranov returned to the fort with the salmon experts , he took also a spy with unusual powers of observation and deduction . At the fort , Raven-heart performed like the other Tlingits , standing knee-deep at the mouth of the river with a wicker scoop , which he dipped among the multitude of fat thirteen-inch salmon as they returned to their natal stream to spawn and give rise to the new generation . They left the salt water like myrmidons , each fish in file behind another , fifty or sixty files across , so that at any one spot at the river mouth for these relatively few days , thousands of fish passed , driven only by their urge to return to the fresh water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lay the eggs which would renew their species . A blind man with a torn net could catch salmon at this spot , and when Raven-heart and his mates had thrown several thousand ashore , they showed the Russians how to spot females rich with roe and how to eviscerate the fish and prepare them for drying in the sun . Baranov , watching the stacking up of food in piles of unbelievable size , told his Russians : This winter nobody starves . ' In the evenings , when work was done and the Tlingits were left to themselves , Raven-heart utilized his time in memorizing details of the growing fort . He saw that the promontory was divided into two halves : one inland , consisting of a blockhouse that could be furiously defended from fixed gun emplacements and portholes through which rifles could be fired ; the other half , a collection of small buildings outside the main blockhouse and not heavily defended . These sheds and barns , he concluded , were to be  | sacrificed in case of an attack , with all defenders withdrawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the seafront , a huge square yard with walls two feet thick . Invading and taking that fortress was not going to be easy . But the more he studied the redoubt the more clearly he saw that a determined assault , which took first the outlying buildings without destroying them and then laid siege to the blockhouse , could succeed if some way were found to break into that huge enclosed yard at the rear , for then the attackers could nibble away at the central redoubt while enjoying protection from the very buildings provided by the Russians , and in time the latter would have to surrender . Redoubt St. Michael could be captured , provided the attackers were led by a man like Kot-le-an and staffed by determined aides like Raven-heart . When the salmon season ended , in late September , the Tlingits were sent back to their hill , with the understanding that they would not be needed next year , since the Russians and Aleuts were now proficient in the business of catching and preserving the valuable fish . Fourteen of the Tlingits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay , but Ravenheart departed with complete plans for capturing this fort , and as soon as he rejoined Kot-le-an , the two men drew up diagrams of the Russian installation and procedures for destroying it . During the remainder of 1799 the impetuous young men were prevented from putting their scheme into operation by the hesitancy of their toion , who was awed by Russian power , and by the thoughtful leadership of Aleksandr Baranov , who anticipated and frustrated any Tlingit moves . Whenever it looked as if the Indians on their hill might be getting restive , he threw them off balance by offering them trades of surprising generosity , and once when several hundred of them threatened actual rebellion , he boldly marched among them , advising them to come to their senses . He 's a brave one , ' the Tlingits said , and in this manner Kot-le-an and Ravenheart were neutralized by Baranov 's clever moves , even though they continued to regard him as their chief enemy . In the summer of 1800 , at the end of the first full year since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's spying warned him that t he fortress had been completed in good style and ahead of schedule , Baranov , to the surprise of all , loaded one of his ships with pelts from Sitka waters , hoisted sail , and set out for Kodiak , where his wife , Anna , and his son , Antipatr , waited in the big log house which served as the capitol of Russian America . He had gone to Kodiak expecting to load there with supplies forwarded from mainland Russia , but when he landed he heard the pitiful news : No ship has reached us in the past four years . We 're starving . ' So his attention was diverted from his outpost at Sitka and directed to the problem which would assail him all his life in Alaska : How can I increase the power of this colony if I 'm ignored and neglected by the homeland ? With Baranov tied down in Kodiak , no help from that quarter could be forwarded to the new establishment at Sitka , and in the summer of 18o1 , Kot-le-an and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would not be able to defend themselves . But just as the  | Tlingits were preparing their attack , the Boston trader Evening Star put into the sound on a return trip from Canton , and whereas on all previous visits it had anchored near the hill to conduct trading with the Tlingits , this time it sailed right past , as if acknowledging that now it was the Russian fort that was important . Seething with anger , Kot-le-an suffered the indignity of having to get into a boat and trail along behind the trader as if hungry for its favors , and then wait in the sound until the Americans had completed details with the Russians . I have been made a stranger in my own land , ' the young chieftain fumed to Raven-heart , who took advantage of the enforced idleness to coach his leader in the steps that would be required when the attack on the redoubt took place . That it would occur , neither man doubted . But it did not happen in i8oi because supplies from the Evening Star strengthened the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making an assault at this time inadvisable . However , on its way out of the bay , the Evening Star did stop at the Tlingit stronghold , where Captain Corey and First Mate Kane proved their basic friendship for the Indians by showing them a corner of the hold in which they had hidden from Russian eyes the trade goods that the Tlingits really sought , casks of rum and flat boxes filled with additional rifles made originally in England and shipped to China . We saved the best for last , ' Corey assured the Indians , and as before , Raven-heart scrambled among the small settlements scattered about the littoral , collecting the still-surprising harvest of sea-otter pelts . When the barter was concluded , Corey and Kane met with Kot-le-an on the hill , and as they shared a bottle of rum , the Americans drinking little but pouring generously for the Tlingits , Corey observed : Would n't it make sense to join these two settlements ? Russians and Tlingits working together ? ' In Boston , ' Kot-le-an asked with surprising acuity , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be possible . ' Here , too , it is not possible , ' and Corey , remembering the large number of guns he had sold these warlike Tlingits , looked at his first mate and with a gesture so slight that only Kane could see it , shrugged his right shoulder as if to say : What happens is their business , not ours , ' and that afternoon he made final calculations on his cargo of whale oil and otter skins , weighed anchor , and headed for Boston , which he had not seen in six years . When he was gone , Kot-le-an told Raven-heart : We 'll wait . If you want to build your house at the southern salmon stream , do it now , ' and this invitation , thrown off so casually , marked a turning point in the slave 's life , for it released him , by implication , from servitude . Because if a Tlingit was free to build his own house , it meant he was also free to take himself a wife to help occupy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eying with increasing excitement a Tlingit girl who bore the lovely name of Kakeena , a name of lost meaning belonging to her great-grandmother . She had not only the bland , open face which bespoke spiritual ease but also a nobility of bearing which warned the world : I shall do many things in my own way . ' The daughter of a skilled fisherman , she was sixteen , and for some lucky reason had escaped both tattooing and the inserting of labrets  | into her lower lip . She was , in these early years of the new century , the self-confident yet modest type of young woman who , in these times of change , might be expected to marry with some Russian in exile , forming with him a bridge between past and present , between Tlingit and Russian . But even as a child she had sensed that this was not going to be possible , for she was fiercely devoted to the Tlingit way of life , and she saw that the spiritual distance between the Tlingit village and the Russian fort was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tlingit woman surrendered her identity , and this she knew she would refuse to do . In recent months her parents had begun to wonder : What will become of our daughter ? ' as if they were responsible for her salvation and not she . They were pleased when several young Tlingit and Russian men displayed their lively interest in her , and during the latest visit of the Evening Star they had been aware that First Mate Kane had tried several times to get her into his bed , but she had rebuffed both him and the local lads for the good reason that she had , when she was only fourteen , identified the slave Raven-heart as the finest young man in the region . In subsequent years she had witnessed his sturdy courage , his loyalty to Kot-le-an , his ability in trading with the Americans and , above all , his comely manner , for she saw in his face the same kind of stately calm she had seen in her own when allowed to borrow one of the magical mirrors provided by Captain Corey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three tasks , to the completion of which he could apply his entire energy : win Kakeena as his wife , build them a house on the banks of the salmon stream beneath the big spruce trees , and carve himself a totem pole like the ones that had graced his home village to the south in the days before his capture and servitude . The various tribes of Tlingits were so different in nature that they scarcely seemed like members of the same family . The Tlingits at Yakutat to the north were almost savage , so intent were they on warfare , raiding and the killing of prisoners . Those like Kot-le-an on the hill above Sitka Sound were warlike enough to defend their terrain but also gentle enough to appreciate the rewards of peace , if it could be obtained on their principles . Those to the south , where Raven-heart had lived , existed along the borders of the Haida people , a distinct branch of Athapascans with their own language , and from them had acquired the gracious habit of carving for each village and prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stately , colorful and a record of events important to that village or that home . Kot-le-an 's people rarely carved totems , and the Yakutats burned them when overrunning a village , but Raven-heart , living as he must in alien land , would not feel easy in any house which was not protected by its totem . So with the vigor which characterized him , he launched all three of his assignments simultaneously . Asking Kot-le-an to accompany him , he marched to the fisherman 's hut where Kakeena lived and solemnly asked her father : May I have the honor of taking your daughter to wife ? ' and before the father could respond , Kot-le-an assured him : This one can be trusted . ' But he 's a slave , ' the fisherman protested , to which Kot-le-an replied : ' No more . Honor erases that , ' and the marriage was arranged .  | That afternoon , on the banks of the salmon stream a mile east of the hill in the heart of a noble stand of spruce trees , Raven-heart and Kakeena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the early evening , when the outlines of their house had been staked out , they hauled ashore the cedar log from which he would carve his totem . Next day , with the help of Kot-le-an himself and three of his assistants , the log was lifted onto the supports which would hold it free of the ground while Raven-heart carved , a task which would occupy his spare time for nearly a year . As he worked on the log , carving only the side that would be exposed in front , he incorporated a personal selection of those precious images which summarized the spiritual history of his people : the birds , the fish , the great bears , the boats that plied the waters , the spirits that directed life . But he did not do so haphazardly ; in obedience to the same principles that had guided Praxiteles and Michaelangelo in fashioning their sculptures , he followed highly traditional patterns for relating forms and color so masterfully that the totem , as it gradually emerged , would be no mere illustrated pole standing before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , magnificent in its final appearance . He and Kakeena were pleased with it when it was finally ready for erecting into place , and they were honored when the toion , Kot-le-an and the shaman came south to honor and bless it as it rose in the air , a signal that in the house below lived a Tlingit family that took life seriously . Married , with a house three-quarters built and a bright totem in place , Raven-heart was at work in June of 18oz when Kot-le-an and two of his men ran east to the salmon stream with exhilarating news : The Russians were never weaker . Now 's the time to destroy them . ' So Raven-heart was dispatched to complete his spying , and from a thicket east of Redoubt St. Michael he determined various significant facts : the dangerous adversary Baranov was not in residence ; his trusted assistant Kyril Zhdanko was gone too ; with so many of the Aleuts returned to Kodiak , the total complement at the fort seemed to be about fifty Russians and only two hundred Aleuts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of small , unprotected buildings along the shore had increased , the big fort itself and its attendant palisaded square had not been strengthened . Reporting to Kot-le-an and his aides , Raven-heart said : Same as the plans we drew up before . Strike by boat from the bay , by land from the forest . Take the small buildings in the first blow , dig in , and then overwhelm the redoubt . ' The first part easy ? ' Kot-le-an asked , and Raven-heart nodded . But the second part ? ' Kot-le-an asked , and his spy gave an honest answer : Very difficult . ' When the force of Tlingit boats left the southern part of the sound at eleven o'clock at night in late June , the sun had barely set , and as the quiet flotilla moved north , coordinating its movement with that of the warriors infiltrating through the forest , the fort was outlined in the silver glow of a midsummer Alaskan night in which darkness would never come . Silently the two forces converged , and at four in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fell upon the Russian encampment , occupied im-  | mediately all the unprotected buildings , and swept into the palisaded yard , and then , following tactics which the spy Raven-heart had developed two years before , attacked the spots he had seen to be weakest , broke through , set the Russian buildings afire , and cut the throats of the defenders as they fled to escape the flames . Russians and Aleuts alike perished , and only those fortunate enough to be absent on fishing or fur-hunting parties escaped . When the carnage was completed , Kot-le-an , its instigator , stood among the dead bodies and cried : Let this be a warning to the Russians ! They can not come and steal Tlingit land ! ' After burning the Russian ships and boats , the victorious Tlingits marched in triumph back to their hilltop home , conquerors of Sitka Sound , protectors of Tlingit rights . Although astonished by the ease with which he had eliminated the Russians , Kot-le-an did not even briefly suppose that a determined man like Baranov would allow such a humiliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when , he could not anticipate , but certain that it must come , he initiated unusual precautions . Striding out to where Raven-heart and his wife were still at work on their new home , he announced bluntly : This is the best site on the island . Our fort must be here . ' Raven-heart , who had spent considerable energy in building as much of the house as was finished and in carving his totem , started to protest this invasion , but was stopped by Kakeena , who stepped forward with a boldness that surprised him : Kot-le-an , we shall have no rest till we drive the Russians from our land . Take our house . ' And when Tlingits arrived to convert their home into a military headquarters , she worked with them . Later , it was she who suggested that the whole area be enclosed in a high , thick , spear-studded palisade , and on the construction of this she also helped . The completed fort  --  a collection of strong small buildings protected by a palisade  --  stood close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound on the south . To the east it was guarded by a dense forest whose older trees fell in crisscross positions when they died , forming an impenetrable thicket . When all was done , Kot-le-an told his people : We can not defend this hill . Russian ships could lie in the sound and bombard us with their cannon , but down on the point where we have our new fort , they 'll not be able to get close enough to harm us . ' When do we move there ? ' some women asked , but the toion replied : Not before the Russians come ... if they ever do , ' and Raven-heart , hearing this almost boastful statement , thought : Kot-le-an 's right . A man like Baranov will return . He 'll have to . So the dream of Raven-heart and Kakeena was lost in the plans of war . The house was built , but it served as a military headquarters , and the totem was in place , but it stood before a Tlingit version of the Russian redoubt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Russians ? ' Kakeena asked , and her husband equivocated : We built it strong . You can see that . ' But can the Russians fight their way in ? The way you did against them ? '  | One of these days we 'll see , ' he replied , and a kind of nervous , passive waiting began . Then in September 1804 , Russian ships crowded with fighting men began appearing in Sitka Sound , first the Neva , come all the way from St. Petersburg , then the Jermak , the Katharina and the Alexander . Three hundred and fifty two-man kayaks also reported at the end of a fearful crossing of the gulf that separated Sitka from Kodiak . Toward the end of the month the sound was dominated by a hundred and fifty Russians and more than eight hundred Aleuts , all well-armed and eager to avenge the destruction of Redoubt St. Michael two years before . Since it was assumed by the Russians that they would have to storm the hill the Tlingits had occupied in the past , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the foot of the hill , with every intention of investing it under gunfire in the morning . But when dawn broke next morning and the Russians began marching up the hill behind Baranov , a brave man prepared for battle , they found to their surprise an unoccupied fort ; all the Tlingits had fled to their big new fortress a mile to the east , where the totem stood protecting the main gate , whose supporting walls were twenty inches thick . Announcing that he had won a victory , Baranov assigned troops to man the abandoned fort and hauled up seven cannon , which were emplaced so as to command all approaches . I do n't know where the Tlingits are , ' he told his men , but they will never again occupy this hill , ' and he would enforce that decision for the remainder of his life . The Tlingits , safe in their new fortress and satisfied that they could hold it against any Russian pressure , laughed when they heard how Baranov had attacked an empty fort , but their attitude became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load extra men on the four warships anchored at the foot of the hill . ' This news did not frighten Kot-le-an , but it did make him wonder how much damage the guns on those four warships could do , so he dispatched Raven-heart to parley with Baranov and settle the terms under which the two groups could share this handsome bay and the riches it commanded . With one young warrior at his side , and with a white flag atop a tall pole , Raven-heart strode down the path leading through the forest , expecting to spread before the Russians the terms which Kot-le-an would be proposing , and he was shocked when he reached the fort to be dismissed abruptly with the scornful words : Our commander does not deal with underlings . If your chief wishes to converse with us , let him appear in person . ' Humiliated and enraged , Raven-heart stormed back to Kot-le-an , informing him that there was no purpose in further negotiation , but during Raven-heart 's absence , the young chief had become more convinced that peaceful sharing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accompanied by a special emissary , returned to the hill , this time by water and in a ceremonial canoe . As Raven-heart brought the canoe to a landing place , the emissary began to chant a flowery message of peace : Mighty Russians , we of the Mighty Tlingit seek your friendship . You took our land for your redoubt , we took back your redoubt  | for our land . We stand even , toe to toe , hand to hand , so let us abide in peace . ' With that , the emissary threw himself from the canoe , lay in water up to his nostrils , and looked pleadingly at the Russian sentries , who whistled for officers to come . Down the steps leading from the hill marched two young men who when they saw the floating emissary began laughing . When they saw that Raven-heart was back again , they spat out the same contemptuous message : If your chief has a message , let him come in person , ' and they were about to withdraw when Raven-heart unfolded before them one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever produced . In English he cried : This is our present to the Great Baranov ! ' and the gift was so compelling that the officers led him up the stone steps to the fort , where Baranov accepted the pelt graciously , giving him in return a complete suit of woolen clothing . In Tlingit the former slave , now a man of considerable dignity , said : Great Baranov , we seek peace , ' at which the Russian spelled out his demands : You must leave two hostages with me . You must confirm our ownership of this hill and such surrounding territory as I shall designate for our headquarters . And you must remain peacefully in this area and trade with us . ' After asking for two repetitions of the demands , Raven-heart asked : You want all this land ? ' Baranov nodded . And you want us to live obedient to your commands ? ' Again the Russian nodded , whereupon Raven-heart drew himself up to his considerable height and said : I speak for our chieftain Kot-le-an and for our toion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not flinch . Looking inquisitively toward Captain Lisiansky of the Neva , who nodded , he said almost casually : Tell Kot-le-an that our attack will begin at dawn tomorrow . ' And by the time Raven-heart reached his canoe , where the emissary waited , the two Tlingits saw that Russian soldiers and hundreds of Aleut fighting men had started streaming toward the four ships and the kayaks . On 1 October 1804 the four warships were ready to sail the short distance to the Tlingit fort and start bombarding it , but an infuriating calm settled over the sound , and the big ship Neva , on which the Russians must depend , could not be moved . However , the Neva was commanded by Captain Urey Lisiansky , a determined and resourceful fighter , and he resolved the impasse by lining up more than a hundred kayaks , which , by means of ropes attached to their sterns , pulled the heavy ship slowly into position . Kot-le-an , watching this herculean effort , whispered to Raven-heart : They mean to fight , ' and stern preparations were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fact that Baranov , fifty-seven years old and overweight , fancied himself a military genius with the right to lead into battle a force consisting of about one-half the effectives . Dubbed by his men the Commodore , he believed that his experience in Siberian brawls and minor island skirmishes qualified him as  | a tactician , and he shouted orders like a battle-tested veteran . However , buffoon though he seemed to some , his gallantry and lust for vengeance on the Tlingits who had destroyed his redoubt so inspired his men that they were prepared to follow him anywhere . But before leading his men forward in the actual assault , Baranov , remembering battle stories he had read , believed he was honor-bound to offer his enemy one last chance to surrender , so he sent forward three Russians under a white flag . When they neared the Tlingit fort , the one in command cried in loud voice : You know our demands . Give us land . Hostages . And stay here peacefully to trade . ' From inside the fort came laughter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negotiators ' heads . These men , afraid that the next shots might be directed at them , scampered back to the Neva , where they told Baranov how they had been received . He did not rant , but to those about him he said : Now we take their fort , ' and as agreed beforehand , Captain Lisiansky dispatched four small boats , heavily armed , to destroy all the Tlingit canoes left on the beach . The battle had begun . Now Baranov , clad in a suit of wood-and-leather armor , sword held high , waded ashore at the head of his men , determined to assault the walls and demand surrender . Supported by three small portable cannon , he stopped to listen for sounds of Tlingits inside the fort , heard none , and cried : ' They 've abandoned it , just like they did the hill , ' and with a bold , peasant heroism he led his men right up to the walls . But as soon as they came well within musket range , the walls erupted with fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the invaders was disastrous , for the unexpected volley struck many full in the face . When the Russians retreated in disorder , the Tlingits broke from their central gate guarded by the totem pole and descended upon the disorganized men , killing and wounding without having to dodge any counterfire . And had not Captain Lisiansky sped to Baranov 's relief , a general slaughter would have occurred . The first round , clearly won by the Tlingits , had been a disastrous defeat for Commodore Baranov . Back aboard the Neva , he revealed to his officers a major wound in his left arm , and after he was put to bed under a doctor 's care , Lisiansky summed up the fracas : Three of my men dead , fourteen Russians wounded and countless Aleuts , who fled like rabbits at the first gunfire . But we gained one victory . Baranov is wounded just seriously enough to keep him from marching forth again . Now let 's organize this siege and blow that fort apart . ' But before the cannonading could begin , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no-surrender affair like the earlier assault on Redoubt St. Michael , where all Russians present were slaughtered , for onto the beach almost in range of their enemy 's pistol fire came six Tlingit warriors bearing spears aloft , on whose tips was impaled the body of one of the dead Russians . At a whistle from their leader , the Tlingits jabbed their six spears sharply upward , driving the points so far through the body of the corpse that the metal tips shone red with blood . Then , at another signal , they threw their spears forward , allowing the body to splash into the bay .  | Minutes later the cannonading began , and when word reached the deck that a fourth Russian had died from his wounds , the fire intensified . For two days the bombardment continued , and a sortie in strength under Lisiansky ranged the area before the fort , killing any Tlingits they encountered , but in doing so , they saw that the great wooden fence constructed by Kot-le-an and Raven-heart had sufficient thickness to repel even the biggest cannonballs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence , ' Lisiansky told his men , and after this was reported to Baranov he consulted with his captain , the elevation of the guns was raised , and cannonballs of destructive size and frequency began raining down into the fort 's interior . Lisiansky , watching them land with rarely a miss , assured Baranov : They wo n't be able to tolerate this for long , ' and grimly the fat little merchant smiled . During the first days of the siege there had been great jubilation inside the fort , for then the Tlingit defenders gained three significant victories : their palisaded walls had proved to be impervious to Russian fire , they had repulsed the first land attack with heavy loss to the enemy , and without suffering any retaliation they had successfully taunted the Russians at the seashore , spearing the corpse and tossing the body into the waves . We can hold them off ! ' Kot-le-an cried in those moments of initial victory . But when the cannonading began in earnest , with the Russians firing over the walls , the tides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some fifteen separate buildings clustered about the house that Raven-heart and Kakeena had started , and with hellish luck the Russian cannonballs began striking these wooden buildings , smashing them apart and killing or badly wounding the occupants . Children shrieked as the destruction continued , and there was a terrible moment when three shots in a row struck the Raven-heart house , scattering embers and starting a fire which quickly consumed the entire building . Raven-heart , watching the raging flames , had a premonition that he was seeing the demise of all things the Tlingits cherished , for this house had been a symbol of his release from slavery and his acceptance into the strongest of the Tlingit tribes . However , knowing he must not allow either Kakeena or Kot-le-an to see his apprehension , he passed among the fort 's defenders with words of encouragement : They 'll stop . They 'll see they ca n't conquer us and they 'll go away . ' But as he uttered such words during the third day of the bombardment he was interrupted by a scream from Kakeena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cannonballs , he ran toward where he had last seen her , but when he reached her he found her standing , mouth agape and looking toward the sky . Unable to speak , she pointed heavenward , and then he saw what had caused her outcry : a shot from the Neva had struck his totem halfway up and had shattered it , knocking away the carefully carved top with the raven and leaving a jagged stump , still tall but forever decapitated . Remembering the legends of his people and their spirits which he had carefully carved in the pole , he was distraught , but still he did not allow  | himself to show his distress at the loss of yet another aspect of the life he loved and had hoped to defend . And the bombardment continued . As daylight waned on the sixth day , Kot-le-an came to Raven-heart with a message the latter had not expected to hear : Trusted friend , take the white flag and go to them . ' Asking for what ? ' Peace . ' On what terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Kot-le-an gathered a team of six to accompany his messenger , Raven-heart stood in the middle of the wreckage and felt the ground swaying under him . A dream was coming to an end , a world was being lost , and he had been selected to be the man to do the surrendering , but before putting into effect the signal of submission , his entire body revolted  --  eyes refused to see , feet to move , and mind to accept the horrid duty  --  and he cried to no one : I can not ! ' It was Kakeena , not Kot-le-an , who persuaded him : You must . Look , ' and she pointed to the destroyed houses , the row of corpses not yet buried , the universal signs of loss . You must go , ' she whispered . Astonished that it was his resolute wife who was uttering these words of defeat , he turned to stare at her , and saw that she was grimly smiling : This time we 've lost . Save what we can . Next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . ' And when he moved toward the gate through which he would lead his messengers of surrender , she walked beside him to the beach , where he called in English to the Russians , who halted their bombardment when they saw his white flag : Baranov , you win . We talk . ' Through a brass trumpet came a reply in Russian : Go to bed . No more bombardment . In the morning we will come . ' At these words , which meant that the siege was over and that Tlingit hopes of recovering Sitka were doomed , Kakeena began a high-pitched wail which Russian listeners interpreted as a lament for lost hopes ; they would have been astounded could they have understood her words : Ai me , the waves have left our shore and only rocks remain . But like the rocks we will endure and in the years to come we shall return like the waves and smother the Russians . ' And as the enemy sailors listened in the falling darkness , they heard one Tlingit voice after another join in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they construed as grief but which was , under Kakeena 's leadership , a commitment to revenge . When Raven-heart and his contingent returned to the fort , they were greeted by silence . The cannonading had stopped , but so had purposeful movement by the Tlingits . Standing in confused groups , they discussed what to do next , and as Raven-heart went from one gathering to the next , he found only consternation and lack of any plan as to what action they must take after the surrender , but toward midnight Kot-le-an and the toion assumed command , and their directives were short and brutal : We shall cut across the mountains and leave this island forever . ' And as those fateful words were whispered through the fort , their awful meaning became clear , for to cross Sitka Island at any point was a monstrous undertaking , consid-  | ering the jagged mountains and the lack of trails . But the Tlingits had decided to flee , and in the four hours after midnight there was in this destroyed fort a hurricane of activity . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the salmon creek and the bay , so only they had mementos which they wished to take with them  --  for him , a fragment of the totem ; for her , a shattered wooden plate  --  but all who prepared to flee carried recollections of their majestic hill overlooking the bay , and all were heavy-hearted . As dawn approached , two groups of refugees had special and heartbreaking tasks : appointed men roamed through the fort killing all the dogs , especially those who had attached themselves to specific families , for to take them on the journey ahead would prove impossible , and there were moments of grief as some animal that had bounded with love at the sound of a child 's voice was slain , but this sadness was soon forgotten , because a comparable team of women led by Kakeena was passing through the assembling crowd , killing all the Tlingit babies . Early on the morning of 7 October , as the mists lifted and the bright autumn sun appeared , sailors from the Neva and the three other ships lined up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept the surrender of the Tlingits , but as they approached the fort they saw no people , heard no sounds , and with uncertainty they drew closer , whereupon a cackle of ravens took to the air , and one superstitious sailor muttered : They feed on the dead , ' and when Baranov peered past the sagging gates , knocked awry by some cannon shot , he saw the desolation , the litter of dead dogs and the tiny human corpses . It was a moment of dreadful victory , accentuated by the sudden appearance from a shattered house of two old women too ancient to travel who were guarding a six-yearold boy with a crippled leg . Where have they gone ? ' Baranov demanded of the women , who pointed to the north . Across those mountains ? ' the interpreter asked , and they said Yes . ' As they spoke , Kot-le-an , Raven-heart and the toion who had lost his kingdom were leading their people across rough land covered by immense spruce trees , each trunk as tall and straight as a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few miles would be covered that day and it would be painful weeks before they reached the northern limits of Sitka Island . When they did , they would have to halt for the building of canoes to ferry them across Peril Strait , after which they would have to find some kind of refuge on inhospitable Chichagof Island , a place infinitely more brutal and unyielding than Sitka Sound . But they persisted , and finally reached the northern edge of the island , and when they saw , across the strait , the mountains of their new home , some wept , for they knew they were making a miserable exchange . But Raven-heart , having been dispossessed before in his turbulent life , told Kakeena : I think we can make a home over there , ' and as he spoke , a fish jumped in Peril Strait and he told his wife : Good sign . '  | Now came the fifteen amazingly productive years , 1804 through 1818 , which confirmed the reputation of Aleksandr Baranov as the father and chief inspirator of Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his burst of energy began , he displayed the enthusiasm of a boy going after his first deer , the wisdom of a Pericles building a new city , the patience of an island Job . As a builder he was indefatigable , for as soon as the last fragment of the Tlingit fort was burned , including all parts of the totem pole , he hurried his people back to start work on the hilltop , where he built himself a modest cottage from which he could survey the sound , the volcano and the surrounding mountains . During his lifetime that cottage would be rebuilt into a more imposing house of many rooms , and after his death , into a grandiose mansion three stories high and crammed with rooms of all sorts , including a theater . And even though he would never see or occupy it , it would always be known as Baranov 's Castle , and from it Russian America would be governed . At the foot of the hill he outlined a generous area including a large lake , and this he enclosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian town . But now a curious problem arose , for Baranov called his settlement New Archangel , while ship captains of all nations , and the Tlingits and Aleuts who shared the site , continued to call it Sitka , the name by which it would ultimately be known . So the fine town would have two names used interchangeably , but only one important rule : No Tlingits allowed inside the palisade . ' But even as he proclaimed that law , Baranov made plans for the day when the Indians would return to help him build a greater New Archangel , and when a huge area adjoining the palisade was cleared , he explained to the townspeople : That 's to be kept for the Tlingits when they start to come back . They 're sensible people . They 'll see we need them . They 'll see they can live better sharing this spot with us than hiding out in the wilderness , wherever they are now . ' That crucial decision made ? ' Russians inside the walls , Tlingits outside ' ? Baranov turned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the help of Kyril Zhdanko in a time so short it startled the workmen doing the building , he had a huge barracks for his soldiers ; a school which , as in the case of the orphanage in Kodiak , he paid for out of his own meager salary ; a library ; a meeting hall for social affairs , with a treasured corner in which a piano imported from St. Petersburg was housed for the dances he sponsored and a stage for the one-act plays he encouraged his men and their wives to perform ; plus a dozen other necessary buildings like sheds for the overhaul of ships putting in to New Archangel and shops in which their instruments of navigation and their cannon could be overhauled . When these day-to-day essentials had been ensured , he turned to Father Vasili : " With this safe start behind us , Father , we 'll now build you a church , ' and with a zeal twice what he had shown before , he plunged into the construction of St. Michael 's Cathedral , which he liked to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was a wooden affair , taller than any of the previous buildings , and when its lower stories were well finished , Baranov himself supervised the erection of a modified onion dome , and on the day of solemn dedication , with a choir chanting in Russian , he could truthfully tell the parishioners : With our fine cathedral in place , New Archangel becomes Russian forever and the center of our hopes . ' Some weeks after the dedication he received a confirmation of his dreams , which gave him profound joy , for an aide came rushing up the hill , shouting : Excellency ! Look ! ' and when he ran to the parapet surrounding his cottage , he saw a score of Indians looking tentatively toward the palisade in the hope of permission to build houses in the space Baranov had set aside for them . If the Russians on guard were perplexed by the arrival of these former enemies , Baranov was not ; he had been expecting them , and now he shouted as he hurried down the hill : Bring food ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And with gifts spilling out of his fat arms , he went to the Tlingits , forcing the goods upon them , and when an old man who spoke Russian said : We come back , better here , ' Baranov had to fight back the tears . However , this moment of exaltation was soon lost as he began to experience the frustrations which would cloud the remaining years of his life , and he himself caused the unpleasantness , because the more important he made New Archangel , the more frequently the Russian government sent naval ships to support the island , and this meant inevitably that Russian naval officers would be appearing in blue-and-braid to inspect what the merchant Baranov was doing out there . ' And as he had been warned in that famous meeting in Irkutsk so many years ago , when he was being interrogated as to his ability to manage The Company 's properties , there 's nothing on earth more insolent than a Russian naval officer . ' The one that Tsar Alexander I selected in 1810 to prowl the Pacific in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archangel , especially the latter , was a prime dandy . Lieutenant Vladimir Ermelov , a brash twenty-five , was almost a caricature of the young Russian nobleman perpetually ready for a duel if his honor was in any way impugned : tall , thin , mustachioed , hawklike in countenance , severe in deportment , he considered enlisted men , servants , most women and all merchants as not only beneath contempt but also beneath civil courtesy . Brave in battle , a fairly good naval officer , and always prepared to defend his behavior with either sword or pistol , he was a terror on any ship he commanded and a dazzling whiteuniformed cynosure wherever he came ashore . Lieutenant Ermelov , scion of a noble family that had provided Russian rulers with some of their most pigheaded and ineffective counselors , was married to the granddaughter of a real grand duke , which gave her an unchallenged patent of nobility , and when she traveled aboard ship with her husband , both she and he believed that she served as personal representative of the tsar . Alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was , as a junior officer told Father Vasili without being reprimanded , damned near insufferable . ' When Ermelov sailed out of St. Petersburg in command of the Muscovy ,  | he had known almost nothing about Aleksandr Baranov toiling away in the fart best east of the Russian possessions , but during this long voyage , which would take him around the world , he anchored in many ports , and in conversation with Russian or English or American captains who had stopped at either Kodiak or Sitka , he began to hear strange tales about this unusual man who had stumbled by accident , it seemed , into a position of some importance in the Aleutians , those damned , fog-ridden fur islands , or was it Kodiak , which is n't much better , ' and the more he heard , the more perplexed he was that the imperial government had placed such a man in charge of one of its increasingly important areas . Madame Ermelova , who had been called Princess before her marriage to Vladimir and who was still authorized to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing about this damned fellow Baranov , ' so that by the time the Muscovy left Hawaii in i811 , they were crammed with tales about that crazy Russian up in New Archangel , as they 're calling it now , ' and the Ermelovs were pretty well fed up with the man they both considered an interloper , Ermelov for political reasons , his wife for social : Vladimir , I know a dozen fine young men in St. Petersburg worthy of a position as governor , and it 's damned irritating to think that a clown like this Baranov has outdistanced them . ' Her irritation manifested itself in her first letter home from New Archangel ; it was addressed to her mother , the Princess Scherkanskaya , daughter of the grand duke and a person attuned to social niceties : Chere Maman , We have arrived in Amerika and I can summarize our entire experience by telling you briefly what happened when we went ashore . From the sea we recognized where we were by seeing the splendid volcano which resembles so much the engravings we have on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entry point , we saw the little mount on which our eastern capital stands . It is a promising site , and if the buildings surmounting it were of appropriate construction and ornamentation , it might in time prove to be an acceptable capital , but alas , although the area consists of nothing but mountains , there is no stone for building , so what happens ? The low , rambling buildings without any sign that an architect or an artist was involved in their planning consist of untempered wood poorly put together and left unpainted . You would laugh at what they call their cathedral , a gross , unplanned , ugly pile of wood topped by an amusing construction which passes for a kind of onion dome , which can be so handsome when done well , so pitiful when the various pieces do n't quite match . But this cathedral ' is a work of art compared to what the natives proudly call their castle atop the hill . Again unpainted , unplanned , and in a very real sense still unbuilt , it is a collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other in haphazard style and allowing no possibility of later improvement . A team of our finest St. Peters-  | burg architects could not salvage this place and I 'm quite certain it will grow worse as time passes and new additions are added at random . However , I must confess that on a clear day , and they do come occasionally but mostly it 's rain , rain , rain , the country surrounding the hill can look supremely beautiful , like the best of the lake scenes we saw in Italy , for in every direction mountains of surprising height come right down to the water , forming a kind of rocky , tree-covered cocoon in which New Archangel rests . And with that volcano standing guard , you have a setting worthy of a master planner . Instead , we have Aleksandr Baranov , a miserable merchant striving ridiculously to be a gentleman , and I shall tell you only one thing about this foolish and incapable man . When Volya and I were presented to him , and we had not seen him before , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat little fellow with a round little belly and a costume sewn by some provincial tailor , because no two parts fitted . When he came closer I gasped , and Volya whispered to me , almost loud enough to be heard : My God , is that a wig ? ' It was and it was n't . It was certainly made of hair , but from what animal I would not care to guess , for it resembled no hair that I had ever seen before and I 'm quite sure it was n't human , unless it came from the beheaded member of some savage tribe . And obviously it was intended to serve as a wig , for it did rest upon his head , which I found later to be quite bald . But it was not that kind of wig which gentlemen and public officials in Europe can wear with such distinction , like Uncle Vanya 's , for example . No , this was a kind of carpet , with a sickly color , no proper texture and absolutely no shape . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part . To keep it on his head , Monsieur Baranov used two strings of the kind you see French peasant women use to keep their bonnets on while milking their cows , and these strings he brought under his chin , where they were tied in a bowknot big enough to have served as his cravat . Later , when this fat little fellow with his absurd wig stood beside my dear Volya , receiving the sorriest lot of guests in all of Russia , not a gentleman among them , the comparison was preposterous and I almost cried from shame for the dignity of Russia . There he stood in his nightcap wig , and beside him stood Volya , erect , proper and never more worthy in his white uniform with the gold epaulets Uncle Vanya gave him . We can not leave New Archangel too speedily for me , and if the above is not enough , I now find that this tedious Baranov has a native wife whom he preposterously calls the Princess of Kenai ,  | wherever that is , but when I protested about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the local priest , a man named Voronov , also has a native wife . What in the world is happening to Mother Russia that she is so careless with her chil-dren ? With fondest thoughts , ever your loving daughter , Natasha The Muscovy remained at New Archangel for nine tedious months , and week by week Lieutenant Ermelov and his princess became more openly contemptuous of Baranov , ridiculing him before his own men as a low merchant and castigating whatever moves he made to improve his capital . The man 's an impossible dolt , ' the princess observed loudly at one party , and in his frequent reports to St. Petersburg her husband wrote disparagingly on Baranov 's intelligence , managerial ability and understanding of Russia 's position in the world . More seriously , in three different letters Ermelov initiated those ugly questions concerning Baranov 's use of government funds which would haunt him in subsequent years : When one considers the funds which our government has had to pour into New Archangel and then looks at the little which has been accomplished , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequestered a fair share of them for his own selfish purposes . These attacks on himself Baranov could accept , since he had been forewarned to expect them from any naval officer who was also of the nobility , but when the Ermelovs began to vent their bile on Father Vasili , accusing him of improprieties that were plainly ridiculous , Baranov had to intercede : Esteemed Princess , I really must protest . There is no finer clergyman in eastern Russia than Vasili Voronov , and in that comparison I include His Reverence , the Bishop of Irkutsk , whose piety is famous throughout Siberia . ' Pious ? Yes , ' she granted . But is n't it offensive to have the leading church figure in an area as big as this with a wife who was a short time ago a savage ? It 's undignified . ' Under normal circumstances Baranov , never wishing to excite the animosity of the Ermelovs , would have allowed this condemnation to pass unchallenged , but in recent years he had become an intense defender of Sofia Voronova , whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage to a Russian invader would form the basis of the new mixed race , Russian-Aleut , which would populate and in time govern Russia 's American empire . As if eager to prove the correctness of Baranov 's predictions , Sofia had already given birth to a fine boy child , Arkady , but the underlying reason for Baranov 's predilection for this smiling , lovely woman lay in the fact that once more he himself was without a spouse . For reasons he could not fathom , his native wife , Anna , was behaving exactly like his  | Russian wife : she was refusing to leave comfortable Kodiak to live with him in what she considered a less desirable residence , New Archangel . Deprived of two wives , he brought his two half-native children to Sitka , where he acted as both father and mother , and resigned himself to the fact that he was one of those men unable to hold on to a wife . But in this loneliness he found increasing pleasure in watching the marital progress of the Voronovs , and the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two people discovered fulfillment in each other , the more he saw in them the emotional satisfaction denied him in his own marriage . Vasili Voronov was proving to be an almost ideal clergyman for a place like New Archangel . Courageous in battling frontier situations , loyal in supporting the lay governor , and dedicated to the law of Jesus Christ on earth , he moved about his enormous parish like the first disciples , and wherever he touched or paused to give comfort , he produced an almost tangible Christianity . If the early fur traders brought disgrace to the concept of Russian imperialism , Father Vasili erased that stain by bringing love and understanding . In this work he was supported by his Aleut wife , who continued to organize and tend nurseries and orphanages and who formed a glowing bridge between her pagan fellow Aleuts and her husband 's Russian Christianity . She was , Baranov thought , an ideal pastor 's wife , and in his support of her efforts he became a kind of father to her , so he was not disposed to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Princess , ' he said , after listening to the latest diatribe , but I have found Madame Voronova , whom you call a savage , to be a true Christian ; indeed , a jewel in our North American crown . ' The princess , not accustomed to rebuttal from anyone , looked down her patrician nose at this ridiculous baldheaded man  --  Baranov wore his wig only on ceremonial occasions  --  and said haughtily , as if dismissing some peasant : Monsieur Baranov , here in New Archangel , I see hundreds of Aleuts and they are all savages , the priest 's wife among them . ' Fully aware of the dangerous course he was pursuing , Baranov thrust his fat little chin out and said : I see in those same Aleuts the future of Russian America , and none is more promising than the priest 's wife . ' Startled by this rude refutation , the princess snapped : Mark my words , you 'll see that one slide back into the gutter . If she poses as a Christian , it 's only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and when she next saw her husband , she stormed : Baranov spoke harshly when I reprimanded him for defending that pathetic Aleut woman attached to the priest . I want you to inform St. Petersburg that this Voronov is making a spectacle of himself with that little savage . ' Vladimir Ermelov had , in the wisdom that married men acquire so painfully , learned never to oppose his strong-willed wife , especially since she maintained close contacts with the tsar 's family . But this time he did quietly ignore her fulminations against Sofia Voronova because in his dispatches home he simply had to report glowingly on the conduct of her husband , and it was these first assessments which were to pave the way for the extraordinary events which emerged later in the life of Father Vasili :  | The worse Baranov appears , and I have reported only his most glaring defects and malperformances , the better does his priest Vasili Voronov stand out as an exceptional churchman . In the perfection of his approach and accomplishment he is almost saintly and I commend him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious perfection but also because he represents Russia so ably . He has only one drawback that I have been able to detect : he is married to an Aleut lady of markedly dark complexion , but if he were to be promoted to a superior post , I suppose he could be released from her . Now , when the princess railed against both Baranov and Sofia Voronova , Lieutenant Ermelov loudly agreed with her regarding the man but remained silent when Sofia was the target , and in this persistent way he continued to undermine Baranov 's leadership of the colony , for as he told his wife and anyone else who wished to listen : Just as you can not operate a naval ship with peasants , so you ca n't run a colony with merchants . In this world gentlemen are at a premium . ' As the Muscovy was preparing to quit New Archangel for the return trip to Russia , documents arrived confirming Ermelov 's basic attitudes , for one set of papers brought severe rebukes to Baranov for his supposed laxity in minding The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vast domain stretching from Attu Island in the west to Canada in the east , while another set informed Lieutenant Vladimir Ermelov that the tsar had authorized his promotion to lieutenant captain . Baranov , mortified by the harshness of the criticism , sought counsel with Father Vasili , to whom he poured out the misery of his position : I had hoped that the next ship would bring me the funds to do the work required and perhaps a notice that I had at last been recognized with a title of some kind  --  nothing big , you know , just this or that of the third class , but with a ribbon testifying to the fact that I was now a member of the lesser nobility .. Here he broke down , a sorely disappointed man in his sixties , and for some moments he fought against tears . There , there , Aleksandr Andreevich , ' the priest whispered , God sees the worthy work you do . He sees your charity to children , the love with which you bring Aleuts into the bosom of His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asked : Then why ca n't the government see it ? ' and Voronov gave the answer which had resounded through the centuries : Preferment is not dispensed in rational portions , ' and after a thoughtful digestion of this truth , Baranov laughed , wiped his nose , and said : True , Vasili . You 're six times a better Christian than the Bishop of Irkutsk , but who recognizes it ? ' Then , self-pity laid aside , he took the priest 's hands and said with great solemnity : Vasili , I 'm an old man and very tired . This endless work eats at a man 's soul . Twenty years ago I begged St. Petersburg to send a replacement , but none has come . That ship down there , it brings condemnation of my work but no money to help me do better and no younger man to take  | my place . ' Now , dealing with real disappointments and not with transitory wounds to his vanity , he could no longer control himself , and tears of the most burning kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , distorted life he was a failure and a worn-out one to boot , so he sat before his priest , shoulders shaking , head bowed : ' Vasili , pray for me . I am lost at the end of the world . I know not what to do . ' But an even greater humiliation awaited . When Ermelov received notice of his own promotion , his wife initiated a gala celebration which would include all the ships in the bay , the multiple rooms atop the rock , and even the Aleut workmen inside the walls and the Tlingits outside ; and the princess arranged it so that naval funds would pay for the ship festivities , while the celebrations ashore would be charged against Baranov 's depleted treasury . When the chief administrator learned of this duplicity he was outraged : ' I have no treasury . I have no money . ' But as the entertainments began and Baranov witnessed the jollity of the sailors and the Indians , he found himself caught up in the celebration , and at its height , when Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stepped forward to receive from Father Vasili the oath of allegiance , Baranov cheered with unfeigned generosity , even though both he and the priest knew that he was many times more effective as a commercial-political manager than Ermelov was as a naval geopolitician . A lesser man than Baranov might have been immobilized by the incredible position in which he now found himself : not only to be accused of stealing Company funds when The Company refused to send him any funds , but to be accused of diverting this Company money to his personal use at the very time when he was spending his own funds on work The Company should be doing , like caring for widows and orphans ! It was insane , but he refused to let it disorient him , taking refuge in a comforting saying and an even more comforting visit south . The saying explained and forgave everything : ' That 's Russia ! ' and the excursion soothed away mortal wounds . Seventeen miles south of New Archangel , lost in a wilderness of islands and surrounded by mountains that rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a spring , rank with the smell of sulfur , which bubbled forth in a copious steaming flow that could be mixed with a trickle of icy water from a nearby stream , making it bearable to soak in . For a thousand years or longer the Tlingits had treasured this spring , hollowing out spruce trunks to serve as pipes to feed water from the spring and nearby stream into a stone-lined hole dug in the earth . Ingeniously , the Tlingits had fixed the cold-water pipe with a swivel so that it could be swung aside when the hot water was properly tempered . It was a congenial place , hidden among trees , protected by mountains , but so situated that one could luxuriate in the tub and gaze out upon the Pacific Ocean . One of the constant regrets voiced by Kot-le-an and Ravenheart in their distant exile was : ' I wish we could go back to the hot bath , ' and one of the first things the Russians did when they captured the hill was to sail south and build at the sulfur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring in the two kinds of water . In time they had a spa equal to any in the homeland , and as soon as Baranov had the area pacified he began his visits to the baths . Was Ermelov behaving outrageously ? Off Baranov scuttled to the hot baths . Was his replacement seven years overdue ? Down he went to the sulfur treatment , and as he lay back in the tub , working the two pipes with his toes , and the hot water steamed him to a rose-petal pink , he forgot the irritations which others wreaked upon him , and in his repose he visualized the great things yet to be done . So on the happy day when the Muscovy finally sailed from New Archangel to carry Lieutenant Captain Ermelov back to Russia , Baranov stood on the shore , waving farewell with the obedient enthusiasm of an underling , but as soon as the ship was out of sight he called for an assistant : Let 's go to the baths . I want to cleanse myself of that odious man , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps which would make his tenure in the east so productive and so remarkable to later historians . When he sailed back to New Archangel after his visit to the baths , his shiny round head was bursting with new ideas , and he was pleased to see that yet another foreign ship had anchored during his absence . As he drew close enough for the letters on the bow to become readable he smiled ? Evening Star . BOSTON  --  and he supposed that Captain Corey was bringing in his hold much-wanted cargo , like food and nails , and just as much that was not , like rum and guns . Relieved to see an easygoing American ship replace the stiff and disagreeable Muscovy , Baranov greeted Captain Corey and First Mate Kane warmly , inviting them to his home on the hill and learning from them the details of Napoleon 's latest triumphs in Europe . With the generosity which marked all his dealing and which accounted for discrepancies in his accounts , if there were such , he told the Americans and Father Vasili as they dined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened of Napoleon , the tsar has n't had the time to bother about us out here . Or send us the money he promised . ' But as this first evening wore on , difficult questions existing between America and Russia began to surface , and Baranov said with considerable frankness : Captain Corey , this town is most delighted to see you back in these waters , but we trust you 'll not be trading rum and guns to the Tlingits . ' Corey answered with a shrug , as if to say : Governor , we Americans trade as we can , ' and Baranov , interpreting the shrug correctly , warned in an amicable way : Captain , I have orders to halt your trade in rum and guns . Such trade destroys our natives , makes them useless for any worthy purpose . ' Very firmly Corey replied : But our nation insists upon its right to trade anywhere on the high seas and with any goods we wish . ' But this is not the high seas , Captain . This is Russian territory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I think not , ' Corey said without raising his voice . Where we sit tonight , yes . Sitka Sound is Russian . ' Like most foreigners , he spoke only of Sitka  | Sound , never of New Archangel , and this added to Baranov 's irritation . But the waters hereabout , they 're open sea and I shall treat them as such . ' Very evenly Baranov replied : And my orders are to prevent you from doing so . ' Miles Corey was a small , grimly determined man who had spent his life contesting the seas and their harbors , and Russian threats did not alarm him any more than had the threats of Tahitians or Fijians : We honor without question your preeminence here in Sitka , but you have none in what we deem international waters . ' So you intend to peddle your rum and guns to our natives ? ' Baranov asked , and Corey said with firm politeness : We do . ' It was curious , and a fact long to be debated by historians and moralists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow the higher dictates of religion and public behavior , England and America , should feel themselves entitled by some moral justification which others could not discern to trade as they wished with what they called the backward nations of the world . ' In defense of this inalienable right , England felt herself justified in forcing opium upon the Chinese ; while America insisted upon the right to trade rum and guns with natives everywhere , even , it must be admitted , to her own warlike Indians in the West . So when Aleksandr Baranov , this doughty little merchant , proposed to halt such trade in his territory , men like Captain Corey and First Mate Kane stated firmly that the rights of free men entitled them to trade with natives under Russian rule as they wished and without fear of retaliation from Russian arms . It 's simple , Governor Baranov , ' Corey explained . We sail north , well away from Sitka , and trade our goods for pelts , and no one 's the worse off . ' Except the natives , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have to spend vast sums to protect ourselves from those who now have guns , ' and he pointed to the palisade which had to be maintained at such heavy cost . The problem was not resolved that time . The superior American morality prevailed , and the Evening Star laid plans to sail north to dispose of its goods for the dwindling supply of sea-otter pelts . However , on the last night ashore , a conversation occurred which had a profound effect upon development in this part of the world , for while Captain Corey talked with the Voronovs about Tlingit and Aleut history , Baranov and onetime-harpooner Tom Kane sat off to one side , looking down upon the silvery gray beauty of the harbor , and the Russian said , Mr. Kane , New Archangel will never be the first-class city I plan until we have our own shipbuilding yard . Tell me , how difficult is it to build a ship ? ' I 've never built one . ' But you 've sailed in them . ' Sailing and building , two different challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows ships so well , do you think you could build a ship ? ' If I had the proper books , yes , I suppose I could . ' Can you read German ? '  | I was fifteen before I could read English . ' But you did teach yourself ? ' I did . ' So did I , ' Baranov said . I wanted to start a glass factory , got a book from Germany and taught myself to read that language . ' Was the factory any good ? ' Satisfactory . Look , ' and he produced a German text on shipbuilding , an elaboration of the one Vitus Bering had used a century earlier . Kane , hefting the volume and inspecting a few drawings , handed it back : A glass factory can work if it 's merely satisfactory . A ship ca n't . ' So he dismissed Baranov 's implied invitation but he could not dismiss the man 's penetrating vision of what Sitka might become , and when he asked about this , he knocked the top off a volcano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to build ships here , a score of them . And plant a colony in California , where the Spaniards accomplish nothing . I think we ought to trade with China . And with a captain like you in his own ship , Hawaii would be wide open for trade and maybe even settlement . ' Reaching out and taking Kane by the arm , he asked : What did you think of Hawaii ? ' And there at the edge of the Pacific , Kane was lured into disclosing his admiration , indeed his longing , for those heavenly isles . Somebody ought to take over those islands , ' he said enthusiastically . If Russia does n't , England or America will . ' Now Baranov became more pressing : Mr. Kane , a man your age . . . How old are you ? Past fifty ? You ought to be captain of your own ship . ' Kane smiled bitterly : Our first captain , fine man named Pym , promised to promote me along the line to captain one day . But he got himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Corey , thinking he 'd promote me the same way . Never happened . So then I thought maybe one of these days the old fellow would die and I 'd take over . But you can see for yourself , he 's past sixty , strong as ever , and he told me the other day he 'd decided never to die . So I work on . ' He stopped , laughed , and admitted : He 's a good captain and I 'm not unhappy . ' So the Evening Star traded a few goods with Baranov 's people , weighed anchor , and sailed on to the next island north , where they sought out Kot-le-an and Raven-heart , providing them with many guns and their followers with casks of rum . But when the time came to sail north toward Yakutat , where other Tlingits longed for guns with which to attack Kot-lean 's people , because Tlingits enjoyed nothing more than a good battle now and then  --  among themselves if no Russians were at hand  --  First Mate Kane stayed behind with Raven-heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kane said : Tell him I 'm staying here , ' and the ex-harpooner spoke so forcefully that no one cared to challenge him . What shall we do with your things ? ' the sailors asked , and Kane said : There are no things . I brought them with me . ' And two days later he and Raven-heart were in a canoe paddling down to Sitka , where Kane informed Baranov that he had come south to start a shipyard , while Raven-heart used  | this opportunity to scout out the Russian defenses against the night when his Tlingits would attack once more . When Tom Kane of Boston , using a German shipbuilding manual whose words he never learned to read but whose drawings he followed , completed building four ships , Sitka , Otkrietie , Chirikov and Lapak , his employer , Baranov , was ready to make his long-planned moves in the Pacific . Commissioning a group of bright young men and giving them two ships , he sent them off to occupy a fine site north of San Francisco , and the Spaniards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they allowed the Russians to gain a substantial foothold . So a remarkable situation developed in this part of the world . Before cities like Chicago or Denver were even thought of , and while San Francisco had no more than a few score of residents and the future Los Angeles none , Sitka was a thriving town of nearly a thousand , with its own library , school , shipyard , hospital , navigation center , civil government and navy . In addition , it controlled a solid foothold in California , and under Baranov 's prudent leadership , seemed destined to command the entire west coast of the Pacific down to San Francisco and probably beyond . From that solid beginning , Baranov decided to reach into the central Pacific , for after Kane had finished with his shipbuilding , he was given command of the Lapak , with orders to establish good relations with King Kamehameha in Honolulu . Since Kane and the king already knew each other favorably , the wooing of Hawaii proceeded so rapidly that other nations began to fear they might have to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthened the friendship between Hawaii and Sitka and for a spell of years it looked as if the golden islands were destined to fall under Russian control . But now hammer blows began to strike Baranov . Close to exhaustion , he pleaded with St. Petersburg for three boons : money to complete building his beloved capital at New Archangel , a replacement to serve as chief administrator and , at the end of one of the most productive public services in Russia , some small shred of recognition  --  a medal , a ribbon , a title no matter how mean  --  that would lift him out of the category of despised merchant and enable him to believe , no matter how briefly , that he had won by his energy and imagination a patent of minor nobility . The money never came . But the distant government , acknowledging at last that Baranov was an old man , did appoint a replacement who would assume responsibility for the government , an able fellow named Ivan Koch who had compiled a good record as commander at Okhotsk . Baranov , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the things which really interested him and knowing Koch to be a good man , sent a letter of warm congratulations , which Koch never received , for while at Petropavlovsk on his way to his new duties he died with tragic suddenness . Once more Baranov besieged St. Petersburg with appeals for a successor , and this time a much younger man with good credentials was shipped out to New Archangel aboard the Neva , a reliable ship familiar with the eastern  | Pacific . From the lookout room in his house Baranov watched with delight as the Neva approached the bay , then with horror as it ran into a storm off Edgecumbe volcano and sank within reach of land , taking to their death most of her complement , including the new governor . It was a savage disappointment , worsened by the return of the notorious Muscovy under the command of Baranov 's avowed enemy Vladimir Ermelov , who , since his wife the princess did not accompany him this time , arrived in a foul mood . Among his secret papers was one which instructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during his previous visit : You are to inquire as judiciously and secretly as possible into the financial deportment of Chief Administrator Baranov , who has been reported to us as having sequestered for his own use funds belonging to The Company . If in the process of your investigation you find him guilty of defalcations , you are hereby empowered to arrest and incarcerate him prior to his return to St. Petersburg for trial . In his absence you will serve as Chief Administrator . But now the complexity of government in Russia manifested itself , for in the same mail pouch , directed not to Ermelov but to Baranov , was a letter which brought him great satisfaction . It came from a different branch of government , obviously , for it said : Know Ye All , We do confer upon said Aleksandr Andreevich the rank in the Civil Service of Collegiate Councilor , with social standing equal in rank to a Colonel in the Infantry , a Lieutenant Captain in the Navy , an Abbot in the Church , and entitled to be addressed by all as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcing to the world that Chief Administrator Baranov was now His Excellency Collegiate Councilor Aleksandr Andreevich Baranov fell by tradition to the senior officer present , who happened to be Lieutenant Captain Vladimir Ermelov , commanding officer of His Majesty 's warship Muscovy , and on a bright morning which would bring bile to the throat of that young nobleman , he had to preside on the hill when Baranov , his incredible wig tied under his chin , stepped forward to receive the great honor which the tsar had bestowed upon him . With taut lips and in a whisper so low that few could hear , Ermelov read in grudging terms those words which lifted Baranov into the nobility . It was then incumbent upon Ermelov to place about Baranov 's neck the ribbon from which was suspended the shimmering medal he would henceforth be entitled to wear , and then came the worst moment of all , for by custom Ermelov was now required to kiss the recipient on both cheeks . He planted the first one with obvious repugnance , and as he made preparations to award @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud that all could hear : For the love of Jesus Christ , take off that wig . '  | Two weeks later , when Ermelov was well on his way into the garbled books of the New Archangel office of The Company , he was required to discharge an even more disagreeable obligation , for one of his young officers , scion of one of Russia 's noblest families , came to him with a request which stunned him : Respected Lieutenant Captain Ermelov , with your permission , sir , I want to marry a local girl of impecable reputation , and in obedience to custom , I beg you to represent me when I make my petition to the girl 's father . Will you do me the honor , sir ? ' Ermelov , aware of his responsibility to protect the noble families of Russia and to prevent hasty marriages which would damage them , sparred for time with the ardent young man . Holding himself very erect and looking his most severe , he asked : Surely you 're mindful of the exalted position your family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know that you must not stain its impeccable reputation by an improper marriage ? ' Of course , my parents would be appalled if I behaved poorly . ' So would n't circles at the court deem it imprudent if you were to marry some chit of a child here in New Archangel ? Some Creole , no doubt ? ' I 'd never do that . This young lady is the daughter of a princess . She 's lovely and will glow in even the highest court circles . ' A princess ? I thought my wife was the only princess in New Archangel , and she 's no longer here . ' He coughed . Who is this paragon ? ' Baranov 's daughter Irina . ' The cough turned into a choking sound , and then into a sputter : Do you believe that nonsense about Baronov 's wife being the daughter of some stupid king somewhere ? ' Yes , Excellency , I do . Baranov showed me a paper signed by the tsar himself , legitimizing his second marriage , and another confirming his new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Why have n't I heard about such a ukase ? ' Ermelov stormed , and the young suitor explained : It arrived after you returned to Russia , ' and when he borrowed the precious papers to show Ermelov , the reluctant officer had to honor them . So on a solemn summer day , with the sun reflecting from the many mountaintops , Lieutenant Captain Ermelov , in his best dress uniform , accompanied his aide to the hill , where they were met by His Excellency Baranov wearing over his ears his wig and upon his chest his medal . Your Excellency , ' Ermelov began , the words sticking in his throat , ' my distinguished aide , a young man of excellent family well regarded by he tsar , seeks permission to marry your daughter Irina , lineal descendant of the kings of Kenai . ' Baranov , bowing before the man who was now of rank no higher than his own but of a more ancient lineage and therefore entitled to respect , replied in a low voice : You do our humble house great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repaired to a balcony , from which they could look west to the volcano where the Neva had foundered , north toward the  | site where Redoubt St. Michael had stood before Kot-le-an and Ravenheart destroyed it , and then to the mountains where Raven-heart was plotting his revenge . With his daughter married into the nobility and his own patent of nobility firmly about his neck  --  he wore it on all occasions , even when drinking beer at the close of day  --  Baranov should have been at the golden apex of his life , a man respected in New Archangel , valued at The Company offices in Irkutsk , and esteemed in St. Petersburg for his sagacity in handling problems in the Pacific , but as the months passed , it became obvious that Lieutenant Captain Ermelov was probing Company records to prove that the old man was a thief , and as the scandal grew , Baranov withered . He was seventy now , resident in the islands for an unbroken twenty-six trying years , and his health had never been good since the day of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that improvised boat in Three Saints Bay . Four or five times subsequently he had been near to expiring , but he had struggled on , subduing adversities which would have collapsed a lesser man . He had brought order among the trader-hunters , utilized creatively the Aleuts , and conquered the warlike Tlingits . On a mountainous island at the edge of North America he had constructed a capital worthy of a vast territory , and above all , he had defended widows and cared for orphans , spending his own money in doing so . To end his life accused of petty thievery was almost more than he could tolerate and twice he contemplated suicide , but he was prevented from indulging in such negative actions by the unwavering loyalty of three trusted friends : Father Vasili and his wife , and his aide Kyril Zhdanko , who in these latter days stepped forth as his protector and the man who could be relied on to see that his grand designs moved forward . As the rumored accusations of thievery intensified , he appeared infrequently in public and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that people in the settlement were speculating as to when he would be thrown into irons and bundled aboard the Muscovy for return to Russia in disgrace . Lieutenant Captain Ermelov did nothing to defuse these rumors ; indeed , he encouraged them , waiting for the day when he could inform the man who would come out from St. Petersburg to replace Baranov : I think we have a case against him . We 'll be leaving for Russia promptly . ' During this time , an American ship put in to Sitka Sound , where it traded openly with rum and guns , now that Baranov no longer had the energy to combat this evil traffic . Then the ship sailed north to the remote settlement in which Kot-le-an and his aide Raven-heart continued to collect rifles against the day when they could once more attack the Russians . But now when they learned from the Americans that their old foe Baranov was being shipped back to Russia in disgrace , they decided they had one last score to settle with the old man , and as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baranov so assiduously climbed into a canoe and started paddling south to meet for the last time with their adversary . They were spotted from a distance as they came into the island-studded  | sound , and as they glided resolutely through the myriad islands , word flashed through the capital that Tlingits in war dress were approaching the hill , and everyone who could rushed down to the waterfront , where with great dignity the two warriors were approaching the landing . When they were close enough for their identity to be established , a wild cry surged through the settlement : Kot-le-an is back ! Here comes Raven-heart ! ' And Baranov himself came down the eighty steps that separated his house from the shore , ignoring those who fell back to whisper about him and going directly to where the canoe was being pulled ashore . As soon as Raven-heart stepped on dry land he halted , raised his right hand , and launched into a ten-minute oration delivered in a deep , thundering voice . The highlights of his message were memorable : Chief Warrior Baranov , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies who destroyed your fort to the north , who lost our fort down here , greet you . In all our battles , you were toion . You fought well . You behaved with generosity when you won . You have given our people who live beyond the palisade a good life . Manager Baranov , we salute you . ' With this , the two warriors , still big and powerful , moved forward to embrace their old enemy , and after warmly welcoming them , Baranov suggested : Let us climb the hill together , ' and there on the porch of his hilltop house these three good men who were losing so much surveyed the noble theater in which they had played out their tragedy . Up there 's the fort we drove you out of , ' said Raven-heart , explaining how he had scouted the defenses while smoking salmon . And down there 's the fort you Tlingits thought could not be taken , ' Baranov said , and Kot-le-an surprised them both by saying : My heart broke when your cannon shattered our totem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They shared the saddest reversals an older man can know , the loss of dreams , and that evening dusk fell with a heavy sadness , but it was relieved somewhat when Baranov left them for a moment to fetch a most surprising gift . Retiring to his room , he tied on his wig as ceremony required , placed about his neck the medal proclaiming his nobility , and lifted from a wooden trunk a bulky article in which he took considerable pride . It was the wood-and-leather suit of armor which he had worn when marching against the Tlingit fort . Holding it forth in both arms , he approached Kot-le-an and said : Bold Chieftain , ' but then his voice broke . For some moments he stood in the growing dark , striving to control his tears , and as his shoulders trembled his wig bobbed up and down , so that he was about as ridiculous as any make-believe commodore could be . Finally he controlled himself , but he dared not trust his voice , so in silence and with a kind of love for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his armor , even though he had good reason to believe that at some future date , after he was gone , they would come storming back to try once more to destroy the Russians .  | In disgrace and threatened with prison when he reached St. Petersburg ? except that Father Vasili Voronov had volunteered to travel at his own expense to the capital to defend his friend from the insane charges lodged against him  --  Baranov left Sitka Sound a prisoner aboard a Russian warship , which wandered across the Pacific to Hawaii , whose wondrous islands he had almost brought into the Russian Empire , and then down to the unlikely port of Batavia in Java . Here , in one of the hottest , most feverish outposts of the Pacific , he was kept penned up aboard ship , until his frail body collapsed in final surrender . He died on 16 April 1819 near the strait which separates Java from Sumatra , and almost immediately the sailors weighted him with iron , tied his beloved medal about his neck , and tossed him into the ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific Ocean and all had perished in their attempt . In 1741 , Vitus Bering died of scurvy on a forlorn island in the sea named after him . In 1779 , James Cook was slain on a remote beach in Hawaii . And in 1819 , Aleksandr Baranov died of exhaustion and fever near Sunda Strait . They had loved the great ocean , had conquered it in part , had been destroyed by it , and had been consigned in death to the vast , consoling sea . Baranov was not a great man and sometimes , as in his enslavement of the Aleuts , not even a good man . But he was a man of honor , and in the Alaska he molded his memory would always be revered . In 1829 , ten years after the death of Baranov , the old warship Muscovy put in to Sitka Sound , bringing as passenger from St. Petersburg a bright-eyed young university graduate who was returning to his home island after a course of study in which he had distinguished himself . This was in the time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interim chief administrator , a notable appointment in that he was the first Creole to occupy that powerful position . The returning young man was Arkady Voronov , himself a Creole as the son of the Russian priest and the Aleut convert Sofia Kuchovskaya . Twenty-eight years old , he came with an appointment as assistant manager of trade affairs and with a passionate attachment to a young woman he had met during a visit to Moscow . So , after greeting his parents with the affection that had always marked his relationship to them , he paid his respects to Chief Administrator Zhdanko and then repaired to his room in the priest 's quarters next to St. Michael 's Cathedral , the little wooden church with the big onion dome and the pretentious name . There , as soon as his bags were stowed , he wrote to his beloved back in Moscow : My darling Praskovia , The voyage was simpler than the others had predicted . Five easy months , with a halt at the Cape and another in Hawaii , where I  | had expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are now our enemies because of errors made by others , and I 'm afraid we 've lost our chance to make those islands part of our empire . Sitka Sound is as beautiful as I remembered it , and I long for the day when you stand here beside me enjoying its majesty of islands and mountains and lovely volcano . Please , please convince your parents that it is safe to make the trip , which really is n't so long , and then to live here in what 's becoming a major city . I have given your silhouette in its ivory frame the place of honor on my table , the first item to be unpacked , and I am now hastening to the offices of The Company to acquire data on New Archangel so that your parents can be reassured that it is a real city and not merely an outpost in the wilderness . I shall resume this letter before I go to bed . When young Voronov left the cathedral and climbed the hill to the castle , where Zhdanko waited to instruct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the signs of a bustling town , not a city as he had described it to Praskovia , but a prosperous settlement which no longer depended solely on furs for its wealth . In one direction he saw the tall windmill that operated a grist mill ; in another , the smoking fires where fat from various sea animals was being rendered for soap . There was a walk for spinning rope , a smithy for forging varieties of gear , a boilermaker who made his own rivets , a foundry for casting bronze , and all sorts of carpenters , sailmakers and glaziers . What surprised him was one small shop for making and mending watches , and another for the repair of compasses and other nautical instruments . And for the general population , there was one tailor , three dressmakers , two doctors and three priests . There was also a school , a hospital , a place for public dining , an orphanage run by his mother , a library . Stopping at a corner where the main road intersected with one perpendicular to the bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place always so busy ? ' and the man replied : ' You ought to see it when an American ship puts in to trade . ' From Zhdanko himself he learned the facts about his new post : ' I 'm proud to have at my right hand the son of two people who have been so important to me . Your father and mother , Arkady , are special , and I hope you remember that . But you asked for the facts . Total population inside the palisade , nine hundred and eighty-three . That 's three hundred and thirtytwo Russians with the right to return to the homeland , and a hundred and thirty-six of their wives and children . Then we have a hundred and thirtyfive Creoles who do not have the right of return . We have forty-two children in the orphanage , a horrible number , but we do have accidents and parents do run off . To round out , we have inside the walls three hundred and thirty-eight Aleuts helping us with our hunt for sea otters and seals . Total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tlingits still live outside the palisade ? ' Arkady asked , and  | Zhdanko replied grimly : They better . ' Then he summarized the Russian experience with this brave , intractable people : The Tlingits are different . You never pacify a group of Tlingits . They love their land and they 're always ready to fight for it . ' So you think the walls are still necessary ? ' Positively . We never know when those people out there are going to try once more to drive us off this island . Observe our cannon up there , ' and when Arkady looked up at the hill he saw that three of its guns were aimed down at the bay to fend off any ships which might intrude unexpectedly , but nine were directed at the Tlingit village outside the walls . What reassured him even more than the guns was the energy with which Russians , Creoles and Aleuts attacked the problems of daily living . A few educated Creoles like himself or trusted ones like Zhdanko supervised Company affairs , and Russian clerical types like Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun conducting the businesses that one would expect to find in a thriving seaport . The average Creole did manual labor and most Aleuts went out regularly in their kayaks . He did not find time to finish his letter that first evening , for Chief Administrator Zhdanko and his Creole wife invited him to the hill , where sixteen Russian men , each convinced that he could govern the colony better than the Creole , and their wives had joined to welcome young Voronov to his new post , and he was awed by the handsome new building which had replaced the house he had sometimes visited when Baranov occupied it . The place was now quite grand , with several stories , imported furniture and an even better view of Sitka Sound because obstructing trees had been removed . Everyone calls it Baranov 's Castle , ' Zhdanko explained , because we feel that his spirit still resides here . ' It was a gala evening , with a husband-and-wife team playing four-hand music on the two pianos and a set of surprisingly good baritone solos by Chief Clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mozart , then a rousing medley of Russian folksongs in which the guests joined , and finally , a most moving rendition of Stenka Razin ' whose grand , flowing notes reminded his listeners of distant Russia . Next night , after a day of inspecting the palisade and seeing the intricate gateway through which a limited number of Tlingits were allowed entry to trade , Arkady did find time to complete his letter : I have now seen New Archangel inside and out , and I beg you , Praskovia , to gain permission from your parents to sail here on the next ship , for this is a complete little city . We have a good hospital , doctors trained in Moscow , and even a man who fixes teeth . The houses are made of wood it 's true , but each year the city grows , and both the chief administrator and I expect it to have two thousand citizens before very long . Of course , it has that now if you count the Tlingits who live outside the walls . And I must tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My father and mother occupy a place of considerable honor  | in this part of Russia . He is known far and wide , through all the islands , for his piety , and he is loved by the natives because he has taken the trouble to learn their language and help them in their way of life before he ever importunes them to become Christians . If there is a saint walking this earth today , it is my father . Indeed , they call him a living saint . And Mother is his equal . She is , as I told your parents most explicitly , an Aleut born , but she is now , I do believe , a better Christian than my father . Goodness radiates from her face and sanctity from her soul . I was , as you may remember , awed by the notable traditions of your Kostilevsky family and said many times that you had a right to be proud of your heritage , but I feel the same about my father and mother , for they are establishing the new line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Praskovia . When you leave Moscow to come here , you must not think of yourself as going into exile at the ends of the earth . People leave here all the time to return to the mainland . Irkutsk is a splendid city where my family served in both government and the church . Hawaii is gorgeous with its wealth of flowers . And some travelers go back to Europe by way of America , which takes a long time if you round the Horn but which is , I am told , rewarding . And if , as Baranov taught Zhdanko to do , we establish significant holdings on the North American continent , you and I could well be important factors in the new Russia . My heart beats with excitement at the possibility . All my love , Arkady Through a bizarre twist , it was this letter which precipitated the final wrenching crisis in the Voronov family , because when Praskovia 's parents received it , they were so struck by that forceful paragraph in which Arkady spoke of his father 's accomplishments in Kodiak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities in Moscow , who copied the paragraph , adding the one about Father Vasili 's wife , Sofia , for circulation among the authorities in St. Petersburg . There Lieutenant Captain Vladimir Ermelov was asked his opinion of the priest Voronov in New Archangel , and Ermelov replied enthusiastically : One of the finest , ' and he instructed the church fathers as to who else now resident in Moscow had knowledge of the eastern lands , and all who were consulted testified that Vasili Voronov , white priest from the noteworthy family of Voronov in Irkutsk , was about as strong a churchman as the Orthodox Church had produced in a long time . In the discussion thus launched , Arkady 's fortunate use of words was often repeated : They call him a living saint . '  | Improbable as it seemed at the time and unlikely as it seems now , the leaders of the church , spurred on by Tsar Nicholas I , who sought to revive the spiritual force of Russian Orthodoxy , decided that what St. Petersburg needed was a forceful , devout man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sanctity . For a host of intricate reasons they focused their attention on Father Vasili Voronov , wonderworker in the islands , and the more they investigated his credentials the more satisfied they were that he was the solution to their problems . But no sooner had they announced their decision to the tsar , who applauded it , than a knotty problem arose . It 's understood , of course , ' the present metropolitan pointed out , if Father Vasili accepts our invitation to come to St. Petersburg as my successor , he will have to surrender his white robes and transfer to black . ' No difficulty , Holiness . You 'll remember that when he took orders in Irkutsk , he did so as a black . ' Why was it he changed ? To marry ? ' Yes , when he had assumed his first office , on that big island they call Kodiak .. Now I remember . You told me about this last week , did n't you ? ' On a busy day , Holiness . He fell in love with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He reflected on this for some moments , striving to recall his own youth and to imagine distant frontiers about which he knew nothing : Are n't Aleuts . . . well , they 're pagan , are n't they ? ' This woman was , but she 's proved to be a most unusual type . More Christian than the Christians , they say . Charity among the children . ' That 's always a reassuring sign , ' he said , but then , as the longtime spiritual guardian of his church , he jabbed his thumb down on the real problem : If she 's as saintly as you say , and her husband must renounce his white robes and take on the black , will there not be an outcry against him and us if he leaves her at her advanced age ? How old is she ? ' No one knew exactly , but a priest who had visited New Archangel offered a guess : We know her husband is sixty-three . She 's probably in her midfifties . I saw her several times and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped , but before anyone else could speak , he volunteered : A fine-looking woman , you know . On the short side but no savage , not at all . ' The metropolitan , wanting to keep the discussion on the main theme , asked : Would Voronov divorce her in order to reassume the black ? ' and an elderly churchman said : To lead Christ 's church , a man might do anything . ' The metropolitan looked harshly at the man and said : You may not believe it , Hilarion , but there were many things I would not have done to attain these robes . ' Then , to the others : Well , would he take the black ? ' I think so , ' said a cleric who had served in Irkutsk . Service in the Lord 's cause would be enticing . And the opportunity to accomplish good is not to be lightly bypassed , either . ' If you mean power , say so , ' the metropolitan snapped , and the cleric replied sharply : Very well , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' the old man asked , and one of his younger helpers said firmly : He has neither sought nor avoided it . The man 's a real saint , I assure you . ' Goodness , goodness , ' the metropolitan muttered . In one family on a remote island I never heard of , we have a male saint and a female saint . Remarkable . ' But when others started to assure him that this was the case , he looked at his advisers and asked the most difficult question of all : If we lure him to St. Petersburg with our dazzling prize , will she let him go ? ' and the priest who had seen her at work said : She would understand if he were called to glory . He broke his vows to marry her . She would , I 'm sure , advise him to do the same if he now seeks to marry the church . ' With that assurance , the powers in St. Petersburg reached the extraordinary decision , applauded by the tsar , to bring into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parish farthest from the capital , Father Vasili Voronov of St. Michael 's Cathedral in New Archangel . But the metropolitan , eager to know that a successor had been selected but not eager to have the man appear in St. Petersburg too soon , suggested : Let us appoint him Bishop of Irkutsk this year and Metropolitan next year , when I shall be too old to continue in the office . ' And even those energetic churchmen who wanted a new leader now had to agree that promoting Father Vasili by easy steps was the preferred route , and even though the tsar wanted a new man quickly , he too capitulated to this strategy , but to protect himself , announced publicly that early next year the grand old man of the Orthodox Church would be retiring . In this strange and devious way , Vasili Voronov received secret notice that if he resumed the black , which he had abandoned thirty-six years before , he would be appointed Bishop of Irkutsk , the town from which his family had come , with every likelihood of further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting information added , as he had been directed by the tsar himself : But of course this would necessitate a divorce . And if your wife , as a member of a people Russia is endeavoring to win over to Christianity , objected . . . ' He shrugged his shoulders . When Father Vasili studied the confidential papers which verified this extraordinary proposal he had two reactions , which he could voice only to himself : I am not worthy , but if the church in its wisdom calls me , how could I refuse ? and then immediately : But what would Sofia 's role be in this ? And without even discussing the profound problem with his son , he left his cathedral and walked from one corner of the palisaded area to the most distant , back and forth past the warehouses he had helped build , then past the stores that Kyril Zhdanko had helped start , out to where the Tlingits gathered on the other side of the palisade , and back to the church which would never have come into being without his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name or her image came up , he realized the cruel choice that was being offered him . For three days he was unable to broach the subject with her , and he refrained for a good reason : he felt sure that if she knew of his chances in l rkutsk and later perhaps in the capital , she would encourage him to change robes and accept the opportunity , even though it would mean leaving her  | behind . And he did not wish in decency to place her in a position in which she must do the choosing . He alone would decide what was right , and he would then place his thinking before her and encourage her to oppose it if she felt she must . Satisfied that neither of them would act selfishly or in haste , he spent a fourth day largely in prayer , which he uttered with that simplicity which had always characterized him : Heavenly Father , from the time I was a child I knew that I wanted to live my life in Thy service . Humbly I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took my vows without even considering any alternative . But inside three years I was altering those vows in order to marry a native girl . As Thou knowest , so well , she brought me a new vision of what Thy church and its mission can be . She has been the saint and I the servitor , and I could do nothing to injure her . But now I am called to a higher service in Thy church , but to accept it , I must once again revise my vows and commit a grave wrong against my wife . What am I to do ? ' That night was the fifth in which he carried this extraordinary problem to his bed , and as before , he tossed fitfully , unable to close his eyes , but toward dawn he fell into a deep , replenishing sleep from which he did not break till nearly ten . His wife , aware that he had been under some kind of pressure brought by the most recent ship from Russia , allowed him to sleep on , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea and the comforting words : Vasili , you 've been worried about some perplexing problem , but I see in your face that God has solved it during your sleep . ' Accepting the tea gently from her hands , he swung his feet onto the floor , took a long , thoughtful drink , and said : Sofia , the tsar and the church want me to move to Irkutsk as bishop , and from there in due course perhaps to head the church from St. Petersburg . ' Without hesitation , for he was speaking from a vast reserve of faith , he started to say : And this would mean . . . ' But she ended the sentence for him : It would mean that you would have to take the black robes again . ' It would , ' he said , and after consulting God , I 've decided .. Vasili , you started life in the black robes . Would this be so great a change that you should be sleepless ? ' But it would mean .. The two lovers , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 's , crossing bridges that lesser persons might have been afraid even to test , let alone leap upon , looked across the brief space which separated them , she a little Aleut woman less than five feet tall , dark of skin and with a whalebone labret in her lip , he a tall Russian in a nightshirt , white-haired and bearded and troubled . For a painful moment neither knew what to say , but then she took the tea glass from his hands and placed her hands in his , and  | with the strange and lovely pronunciation of Russian words which her Aleut upbringing and the presence of the labret produced , she said : Vasili , with Arkady here to protect me , and perhaps soon with a wife to help , I have no fear , no claim . Do as God directs , ' and he said : Last night , after the midnight bell from the castle , I knew that I must go to Irkutsk . ' He uttered the words softly , then pressed her hands and added : And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . ' Once the decision was made , neither of the Voronovs reviewed it , and neither subjected it to harsh reconsideration or recrimination . Before noon that eventful day they asked their son to accompany them to the castle , where they sought a meeting with Zhdanko , and when the four were settled in porch chairs overlooking the bay and the mountains , Father Vasili said unemotionally : I have been selected Bishop of Irkutsk . This means that I must return to the black robes I wore as a young man . And that means that my marriage to Sofia Kuchovskaya must be dissolved . ' Allowing time for this dramatic news to take effect , he reached out for the hands of Zhdanko and Arkady , saying as he did so : I must leave the care of this wonderful woman to you two men . ' And during the next half-hour he did not speak again . The others discussed a chain of obvious topics : Who would replace him at the cathedral ? Where would Sofia live ? What would be the responsibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was Zhdanko going to do when his provisional term as chief administrator ended ? And even : Is the palisade strong enough to withstand an attack by the Tlingits , an ever-constant threat ? By these practical steps , which reminded everyone that life in New Archangel must go on , even if the spiritual head of the community was moved to a higher obligation , the three participants chose among the various options available to them , and they did so in highly sensible ways , as if acknowledging that Father Vasili was no longer a part of their lives . But when they were finished , with the course of Sofia 's future life determined within reason , Father Vasili broke down , covered his face with his hands , and wept . He was leaving a paradise which he had helped create and whose spiritual values he had both defined and protected . He had helped build a world , and was now surrendering it . He was a white-haired old man , somewhat stooped , somewhat slowed in his movements . He spoke with greater caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his triumphs . He had seen much of the world 's folly , and although he had been forgiving , he did wish that he 'd had more time to combat those aspects of life which were wrong . He was , to put it simply , closer to God than he had ever been before , and he believed that he was prepared because he had learned to do God 's work in whatever position he finally found himself . The ship which had brought the news of his elevation to bishop required eleven days to finish its duties in Sitka Sound , and during the latter stages of the stay Father Vasili completed all details relevant to his departure . But on the last day , when everyone knew that the ship would be sailing at eight the next morning , he had to face the fact that within a few hours he must say farewell to his wife forever , and this became increasingly painful as the  | sun set and the long hours of night loomed . Sitting with Sofia in the main room of the modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I ca n't remember when I first saw you . I know it was at Three Saints and I know it involved the old shaman in some way . ' He hesitated , then chuckled as he recalled his long duel with that frenzied man : All that really mattered between us , I can see now , was that my parents had introduced me to God and Jesus and his had not had an opportunity to do so . ' She nodded : He was an obstinate one . I hope I can defend my beliefs as valiantly as he did his . ' They spoke of the tragic manner in which so many Aleuts had perished during the Russian occupation , and he said truthfully : Months go by , Sofia , without my ever thinking of you as an Aleut , ' and she said quickly : I think of it every day . I mourn the world we lost , and sometimes at night I see the forsaken women on Lapak , too old and weak to venture out for their last whale . My heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had known , the birth of Arkady and the dedication of the cathedral , and this set Vasili to laughing : It seems I 'm to have a real cathedral , maybe even a scintillating one , but whatever form it takes , it can never be a more dedicated House of God than the one you and I built here in New Archangel . ' At the mention of this place , they thought of Baranov and of how it was his will power which had built the thriving little town . He thought of it as the Paris of the East , ' Vasili said , and the darkened room grew silent . A saintly man was deserting his even more saintly wife , leaving her for the rest of their lives for no reason with which she was associated , and there was no more to say . When Praskovia Kostilevskaya , daughter of the notable Kostilevsky family in Moscow , arrived in New Archangel , men working along the waterfront stopped to stare at her , for a young woman of her striking elegance and beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much taller than either the Aleut women or the average Creole , and her skin was markedly whiter , for she was one of those Russians with a strong admixture of German blood , in her case Saxon , which accounted for her blue eyes and lovely flaxen hair . She had a warm smile but also an unmistakable patrician manner , as if she knew how to be congenial toward superiors and haughty toward inferiors , but the general impression she created was one of competence and selfassurance . When it became known that she was the young woman who had come this great distance to marry Arkady Voronov , cynics said : He 's a Creole and he 'll never be able to hold a woman like that . ' To give her time to comply with religious law , her marriage to Arkady had to be delayed for three weeks , and during that time she began to have doubts about New Archangel , for the weather was typical of this part of Alaska . The warm Japanese current which swept clear across the North Pacific came so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clung to the mountains , completely obscuring them for days at a time . After  | the nineteenth rainy day in a row Praskovia lost patience , and wrote to her family , using , as cultivated Russian women did , a host of French words to describe her emotions : Cheres Maman et Soeur , I have now been on this rain-soaked island for nineteen days and have seen nothing but mist , fog , low clouds and the most gloomy aspect of nature a human being has ever witnessed . Everyone here assures me that when the sun reappears I shall be seeing a glorious congregation of mountains encircling us , with a beautiful volcano off to the west . Now , I am willing to believe that not all the people here are prevaricators , so I suppose the mountains do exist , but I find that one must take that on faith , for the visitor rarely sees them . One dear lady , hoping to raise my flagging spirits , assured me yesterday : Rarely does an entire month go by without the clouds lifting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall go to bed tonight , praying that tomorrow may be that one day in thirty . Arkady is even more delightful to be with than we thought in Moscow , and I am divinely happy . We have purchased a small wooden house near the castle , and with imagination and ingenuity we shall transform it into our hidden palace , because on the outside it will not be much . I 'm not sure whether the exciting news about Arkady 's father has circulated in Moscow , but he has been ordained as Bishop of Irkutsk , with every likelihood of becoming , before the year is out , Metropolitan of All the Russias . So you shall be seeing the father in your city while I entertain the son out here in mine . And now the best news of all . Arkady has been appointed secondin-command to supervise the transfer of power from the temporary chief administrator to the permanent one , and when that 's been done , to continue as second-in-command until such time as he becomes chief . For the time being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under five feet tall and with a kind of ivory earring fixed in a hole at the edge of her lower lip . She smiles like an angel and will allow me to do no work , for she tells me in good Russian : When you 're young enjoy your husband , for the years pass too quickly . ' In a later letter I 'll tell you what happened to her marriage , but maybe you can figure it out for yourselves . When the tantamount widow Sofia Voronova heard her prospective daughter-in-law complaining about Sitka 's weather  --  she preferred the Tlingit name for her town  --  she feared that the high-born young woman might prove an unsuitable wife for her son , and she watched carefully as Praskovia made her way about the colony . She knows what she 's doing , Sofia said to  | herself , and when she saw Praskovia go outside the gate to talk with Tlingit market women , she thought : And she 's not afraid . But intuitively this elderly Aleut who had witnessed so many dramatic turns in human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with trepidation . But then , as if this bright child from the social circles of Moscow had anticipated Sofia 's fears , she came to visit her two days before the wedding to say : Mother Voronova , I know I must seem strange to you , and I 'm not going to try to change your mind . But I also know this . Arkady could not be the fine man he is unless someone had taken charge of him and taught him manners and how to treat a wife . I 'm sure it was you , and I thank you . ' Then , to Sofia 's astonishment , for Russian women in Sitka had never been so bold , Praskovia asked : What do you call that thing you wear in your lip ? ' Sofia , appreciating this openness , replied : A labret , ' and her visitor said pertly : All right , now you must tell me what a labret is . ' Sofia did , but Praskovia was still not satisfied : I suspect that one must be very special . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question hang , and for a very long moment Sofia looked at her , wondering : If I told her , would she understand ? And in the end she concluded that it did not matter whether this young stranger understood or not ; she was going to be Arkady 's wife , and the more she knew of his heritage the better . So in a quiet voice she began to tell of life on Lapak Island , and of the death sentence on her people , and of how she and her mother and her great-grandmother had killed the whale : A woman in the village made this from the bone of the whale we killed , and gave it to me as I left the island . ' Seeing that Praskovia was transfixed by the story , she added : Of all the women on Lapak , I was the only one who escaped , and I shall wear this labret till I die out of my love for my people ! ' Praskovia sat silently for a long time , kept her hands over her face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on the following day she came back , laughing in a bright youthful manner , to tell Sofia : In Russia the bride wears something her mother wore at her wedding . I wish I could wear that labret of yours for just one day , ' and the two women embraced , each assured that there would never be trouble between them . Now when the citizens of New Archangel used the phrase the Voronovs they meant the young administrator and his attractive wife , and the older possessors of that name were largely forgotten . Nor was Baranov mentioned very often , and when Kyril Zhdanko was replaced by a permanent chief administrator from Russia , a man with a minor title , he too faded from conversation . A new generation had come in to run what amounted to a new town , and when the American shipbuilder Tom Kane died , the last of the old breed was gone , the arrival of a steam-propelled ship from San Francisco signaling the new day at sea . Arkady Voronov had been in his position as general manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity for leadership was tested , because from the islands to the north the Tlingits under a new toion  | decided that the time was ripe for a renewed attempt to retake Castle Hill , throw down the palisade , and return the settlement to its original Indian owners . With careful planning , the accumulation of many weapons and the stealth for which they were famous , they began infiltrating southward at such a steady rate that soon they had a sizable army in the valleys east of the settlement . With the heroic Kot-le-an dead , they were led by the tested old warrior Raven-heart , who was ardently supported by his implacable wife , Kakeena , and their twenty-year-old son who , because of the spectacular way they had developed , was known as Big-ears . Together the three would form a powerful fighting unit , with Kakeena urging her men forward and providing food and hiding places when they were either recuperating from wounds or plotting their next assaults . Raven-heart decided to position his best men near the palisade gate through which the Tlingit women would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , he , Big-ears and six others would force their way through the gate and break it off its hinges , allowing a hundred or so warriors to flood the palisade . What happened after that would depend upon the degree of success attained by the first wave , but all were prepared to accept large losses at first in order to subdue the Russians . At six in the morning the men hiding among the spruce trees north of Castle Hill heard the sound of the morning bugles , and at eight they watched as two Russian soldiers directed a half-dozen Aleut workmen to throw open the wicker gate . One Tlingit woman entered bearing clams . Another came with seaweed . And as the third moved forward with her fish , Raven-heart , his son and their bold companions dashed into the compound , killing one Russian soldier and forcing the other to flee . Within minutes the battle for New Archangel had begun , with the Tlingits enjoying what appeared initially to be a victory . But Arkady Voronov , commanding from the hill , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant decisions , and at the moment he saw the gate collapse he knew he must wipe out that threat , so without considering the consequence to his own people or the enemy , he shouted to his cannoneers : Fire ! ' and two iron balls of tremendous power ripped into the mass of people struggling at the gate , killing fifteen attacking Tlingits and seven Creoles  --  five men , two women  --  who had come there to barter with the pacified Tlingits . When Raven-heart saw some of his best men crushed by the cannonballs , he was first enraged , then sobered by the realization that those nine great cannon on the castle walls were going to be used , and he shouted to his men : ' Take cover ! ' For three hours the Tlingits remained inside the walls , wrecking whatever they could reach when outside the range of the cannon and defending themselves by taking positions in houses and doorways . It was brutal warfare , which could have continued till nightfall had not Voronov decided upon drastic measures . Dodging from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engage them . Do n't let them escape through the gate . But when you hear the bugle , run back like hell , because I 'm going to fire those cannon . ' With that , he ran up the hill to the castle walls , where he trained six of  | his cannon on the heart of the fighting , that spot near the gate where Russians and Tlingits tangled in one indecipherable mass . Bugler ! ' he cried , and in the next instant the Russians fled the spot , all except one young fellow who tripped , tumbling down among the Tlingits . For a split second Voronov considered holding his fire to allow the fallen lad a chance to get away , but then he saw the milling Tlingits : Fire ! ' and six ricocheting balls swept through the confused mass of Tlingits , killing or maiming two out of three . Raven-heart , alerted by the bugle call , escaped the fusillade , but as he made for the wall , seeking to follow his son with a giant leap , Voronov directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck the Tlingit leader full in the back , crushing his bones and throwing him against the fence that he had been about to climb . Pinned there by his own flesh and bones and tattered clothes , he hung limp for a moment , after which rifle fire from the windows of a nearby house cut him down . Thus ended the attack of 1836 and with it the last hopes of the Tlingits ... during this generation . Of Raven-heart 's four hundred and sixty-seven men , fully a third had been slaughtered inside the compound , and he had died with them . The green hills , spruce-covered and lovely in either snow or sun , would know his breed of Tlingit no more . Kakeena , a widow now , would take her son to a new refuge on an island more distant than Chichagof , and there he would remember this day and plot the manner in which he would lead his expedition for revenge , because no Tlingit like Kot-le-an or Raven-heart could ever accept defeat . . . and Big-ears , brooding on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the young commander 's mother , watched the battle from the castle , and at first she was proud of the manly way in which her son was conducting himself , but when , with victory assured , the big guns continued firing at houses well outside the walls , to give the Tlingits a lesson , ' she saw that peaceful Indians who had elected to live side by side with the Russians were being slain . Stop it ! ' she cried , rushing at the gunners . And her cry was so different from what her son and Praskovia were shouting in this moment of victory , that they were astonished . Turning away from the final salvos of the bombardment , they looked at her in amazement , and saw that she was staring at them as if she had never seen them before . In that moment a wall as high as Denali rose between them . As soon as the cannons were silent , she turned away from her son , going down the steps to work among the wounded , inside the palisade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm or a friend or a child , and as she did so she found that she was identifying not with the Russian victors but with the shattered Tlingits , as if she knew that the latter deserved her help while the former did not . When the Tlingits convinced her that they had been as surprised by Raven-heart 's attack as the Russians , she felt a surge of sorrow for these confused people who had surrendered a life of great freedom in order to live  | in a settled community next door to what her husband had called Christian civilization , ' only to find themselves trapped in a war not of their own making but in which they suffered most . Recalling her own childhood when similar injustices happened , she concluded that it was the kind of thing that was bound to occur when patterns of life were in collision , and she moved back and forth between Tlingits outside the gate and Russians inside , assuring each that life could proceed as it had in the past and that guilt rested on no one . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have to expel the Tlingits altogether ; the people outside the gate rebuffing her with a threat to leave New Archangel and join up with the rebels in a new assault . Unwilling to accept such disillusionment and remembering how on Kodiak she had been instrumental in bringing Aleuts and Russians together , she persisted in her efforts to bind these two strong-minded groups into one workable whole , and gradually it was her view of the future that prevailed . Tell them out there , ' her son said one morning , that we want them to stay . Tell them that when the gate opens tomorrow they 'll be free to bring in their goods as usual . ' You need them , do n't you ? ' she asked , and he said : Yes , and they need us , ' and that evening she went to the still-apprehensive Tlingits : The gate will be opened tomorrow . You must bring your food and fish as before . ' Can we trust them ? ' asked a man who had lost a son in the fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they clustered about her , and in a friendly manner started to question her . One asked : Were you an Aleut before the Russians came to your island ? ' and she laughed to brighten the evening : I still am . ' But in those days you were not of their church ? ' and she said that she was n't . But you are with them now , are n't you ? ' an inquisitive woman asked , and when Sofia said that she had been married to the tall man with the beard who had preached in the cathedral , several wanted to know : ' Is your new religion . . . ? ' They did not know how to finish their question , until a man blurted out : Is there a god , like they say ? ' She remained with them a long time that night , telling them of the beauty she had found in Christianity , of its gentle message where children were involved , of the benign role played by the Blessed Virgin and of the promise that God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction that for the first time , in their hours of distress , certain of the Tlingits perceived a religion that was gentler and more worthy than the one they had been following . It was a persuasive description of Christianity that she offered , for despite the fact that this religion had treated her poorly at the close of her life , taking her husband from her , it had still been the glory of those middle years which seemed to count more than the others . But if she helped the confused Tlingits find a balance between old and new , she could not do the same for herself . At night , in the darkness of her room , she experienced a profound longing to be with the people of her childhood . At times her mind wandered , and she believed that she was once more on Lapak Island , or in the kayak with her mother and great-grand-  | mother chasing the whale , and her yearning for the old days became so persistent that one morning she passed through the gate to speak with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the battle . Could you take me to the hot baths ? ' she asked , pointing south toward that congenial spot where she and her husband and Baranov and Zhdanko had so often gone for relaxation and restoration . The Russians will take you , ' the men protested , afraid that any unusual act on their part might be interpreted as a renewal of hostilities , but she brushed aside their fears : No , I want to go with my own people , ' and with those words she made the last important decision of her life . She was not Russian ; she was not of their society ; she was what she had always been , an Aleut girl of enormous courage , an Indian like the Tlingits , cousin to their leaders Kot-le-an and Raven-heart . If she journeyed to the springs which the Indians had been using for a thousand years , she wanted to go in the company of these gallant Tlingits of the coastal islands . But to protect these men who would take her south , she instructed several women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ask for Voronov , and tell him : " Your mother has gone to the hot springs . She 's all right and will be back by nightfall . If not , in the morning . " ' And off she set for one of the finest parts of the Sitka region . Picking their way through the myriad islands , keeping the great volcano well to the west , they wove in and out of narrow channels , with the mountains guarding them on the east and the placid Pacific smiling at them from beyond the little islands . It was a voyage as wonderful this day as it had been when she had first gone with her husband and Baranov , and she caught herself thinking : I wish it would never end . And then the more painful wish : When we get there , I 'd like to see Vasili and Baranov and Zhdanko waiting . And with such thoughts she lowered her head , ignoring the rim of mountains that welcomed her to the ancient springs . When the two Tlingits deposited her on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stay long , ' then she added hopefully : I 'm very tired , you know , and maybe the springs will help . ' Slowly she climbed the easy hill to where the hot sulfuric waters bubbled from the earth , and when she entered the low wooden structure erected by the tireless Baranov , she threw off her clothes and eagerly immersed herself in the soothing water , which at first she found almost too hot to manage , but as she became accustomed to the heat , she luxuriated in its comfort . After she had lain thus for some time , the waters reaching up to her chin and bringing their therapeutic smell as close as it could possibly come , she lapsed into a kind of dream world in which she heard a ghostly voice whispering her real name : Cidaq ! ' Amazed , she opened her eyes and looked about , but there was no one else in the bath , so she dozed again , and once more from the arched ceiling came the shadowy voice : Cidaq ! ' Now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remembering the day when her husband and Baranov had taken her to the hut beneath the big tree at Three Saints to convince her that the clever shaman Lunasaq had been able , by ventriloquism , to make his mummy talk . It was  | a trick , Sofia , ' chubby Baranov had explained . I ca n't do it very well . No practice . But look at my lips , ' and he had astonished her by keeping them almost closed while words poured out , seeming to come from a root which he kept tapping with a stick . How they had laughed that day , the two men careful not to deride her for having believed in spirits , she exulting in the joy she felt in the brotherhood of her new faith . Now she laughed again at the thought of how she had been deceived . But then , with the hot water reaching almost to her lips , she drifted again , and desirous of communing once more with the old woman of Lapak , she spoke in a kind of hypnotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you heard that they took my husband from me ? ' Young Voronov ? ' He 's not so young anymore . ' Then proudly she added : Metropolitan of All the Russias , that 's something . ' And now he 's gone . And Lunasaq is gone . But you had a good life on Kodiak and Sitka , did n't you ? ' The mummy used the old names for these locations , not the new Russian ones . Yes , but at first , when I thought of losing you and Lunasaq , I could not be happy . ' Does it really matter ? Do n't you suppose that he and I were mournful too , having lost you for a while ? ' I am not unhappy in my new religion . ' Who said you were ? ' You just said you were mournful to have lost me . ' As a friend . What do I care how you pray ? What really counts , in the very old days and in all the days to come ... ' The dome became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this earth as a bride lives with her husband . To know the whales as brothers . To find joy in the frolics of a mother sea otter and her babe . To find refuge from the storm and a place to enjoy the sunshine . And to treat children with respect and love , for with the passing years they become us . ' I 've tried to do those things , ' Cidaq said , and the old woman agreed : You did try , little girl , the way I tried and your great-grandmother . And now you 're very tired from so much trying , are n't you ? ' I am , ' Cidaq confessed , and the old one asked gently : Does it really matter ? ' and she was gone . In the silence that followed , Cidaq lay back , allowing the water to grow increasingly hot and sulfurous , and as she stared upward , she thought : Her religion is of the earth , the sea , the storms , and it 's necessary to a good life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the northern lights , and it 's necessary too . Images from her two lives filled the walls of the bath : the great tsunami knocking down Vasili 's church but allowing the shaman 's lone spruce to stand ; shadows on Vasili 's crucifix at dusk ; that first whale that terrified the women sliding past , enormous even now ; the cluster of children she had cared for after the tsunami ; Baranov with his wig drifting to one side ; the joy with which Praskovia Kostilevskaya from a noble family in Moscow  | stepped ashore to marry Arkady in distant New Archangel ; and dominating everything else , the stately white volcano lifting its perfect cone into the sunset . She knew she had been blessed to have been privileged to share these two worlds equally , and although she had lost both , for she had rejected the Russian way , she did retain the best of each , and for that she was grateful . The heat increased ; the images became a kaleidoscope of the years from 1775 to 1837 ; and the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all : Does it really matter ? It does matter ! Cidaq concluded . It matters enormously . But you must n't take it too seriously . After waiting on the beach for more than two hours , one of the Tlingit boatmen said : I wonder if something 's happened to the old woman ? ' and he insisted that his partner accompany him up the hill so that an honest story could be told if things had gone wrong . When they reached the bath they found Sofia floating free upon the surface of the water , facedown , and the cautious one began to wail : I knew we 'd get into trouble . ' They wrapped her in her clothes , carried her down the hill and perched her in the center of the canoe , then started paddling home . When they neared the landing at the foot of the castle they began waving their paddles , and people on the shore saw only the two men fore and aft and their priest 's former wife sitting upright in the middle seat , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , and men began running toward the castle , shouting : Voronov ! ' In the years following the death of Sofia Voronova , the thriving town of New Archangel discovered , as had so many settlements in the past , that its destiny was being decided by events which occurred in locations far distant and over which it had no control . In 1848 gold was discovered in California ; in 1853 war broke out in the Crimea between Turkey , France and England on one side , Russia on the other ; and in 1861 a much bigger civil war erupted in the United States between North and South . Gold in California excited people in all parts of the world , sent a jumble of them crowding into San Francisco , and altered alliances throughout the eastern Pacific . A totally unexpected development occurred in New Archangel , where the chief administrator sent his assistant on a scouting trip to Hawaii and California to ascertain what the influx of Americans to the west might mean to Russia 's interests . Placing their children in the care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and under palm trees in the familiar town of Honolulu they heard for the first time a rumor which astonished them . An English sea captain , fresh from a trip to Singapore , Australia and Tahiti , asked casually , as if all Russians knew of the matter : I say , what will men like you elect to do if the deal goes through ? ' What deal ? ' Voronov asked , his interest piqued by any suggestion that trade involving Great Britain and Russian might eventuate . I mean , if Russia goes ahead and sells your Alaska to the Yankees ? ' Arkady gasped , leaned back , and looked with consternation at his wife : But we have heard nothing about such a sale . '  | We heard talk of it more than once when we put into port , ' the Englishman said , and Voronov asked pertinently : By English interests ? ' and the captain said : Nothing substantial , you understand , but those discussing it were from various nations . ' But were there any Russians ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Indeed there were . Usually they were the ones who broached the subject . ' Voronov leaned back and said quietly : I do n't intend to boast , but for some years I 've been second-in-command in New Archangel . My father was a leading force in the islands before he was promoted , and I can assure you from all of us that we have no intention of disposing of what is becoming a jewel in the Russian crown . ' I 'm told it 's a splendid place , Sitka Sound , ' the Englishman said quickly . In Honolulu no more was said about the possible sale of Russia 's American holdings , and after arranging for the continued shipment of Hawaiian fruit and beef to New Archangel , the Voronovs moved on to San Francisco , where on the third night at anchor in that glorious bay behind the headlands , a Russian ship captain had his men row him over to Arkady 's ship , and within minutes of their greeting he was asking for details about the possible sale of Alaska to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worried man , but then he corrected himself : At least not in Alaska , and I think we 'd be the first to know . ' So the matter was dropped , and next day Voronov went ashore to inspect the burgeoning city for himself , and as he sat sweltering in a waterfront saloon where sailors gathered , he heard one of the bartenders saying : What a place like this needs is someone to haul ice down from those mountains out there . ' None forms that could be used , ' a veteran of the high country explained . Snow falls , but it do n't form ice . ' Well , it ought to , ' the sweating bartender said . Then he added the words which led to Voronov 's enhanced reputation in the Russian colony : ' Somebody ought to bring ice down here from up north , ' and that night , back on his ship , Arkady told his wife : I heard the strangest idea this afternoon . ' That we 're really going to sell Alaska ? ' No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar , it was very hot , we were sweltering , he said : " Someone ought to bring ice down here . " ' Praskovia , fanning herself with a palm frond brought from Honolulu , studied her husband for a moment , then cried enthusiastically : Arkady ! It could be done . We have the ships , and God knows we have the ice . ' When they returned to New Archangel in early October they hurried to the rather large lake inside the palisade , and after asking a score of questions , learned that ice formed in late November , very thick , and lasted until well into March . Properly protected , ' he asked the men advising him , how long into the summer would it stay frozen ? ' Look up there , ' and on the mountains surrounding the sound , in nests protected from the sun , and even in gullies where the drifts had packed down , he saw ample supplies of snow which had lasted through a warm summer . Properly packed so air do n't hit it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike , we keep ice around here through July . '  | Could you do that on a ship ? ' Better . Easier to keep it from the wind and sun . ' He spent three tingling days discussing his mad project with all the knowing men he could locate , and on the fourth he instructed the captain of a ship heading for San Francisco : Tell them that on the fifteenth of December , this year , I 'll be sending down a shipload of the best ice they ever saw . Arrange for a buyer . ' The cold came early that year , and when the ice was thick on the big lake he and some clever Aleut workmen devised a system for cutting out perfect rectangles of ice , edges square , four feet long , two feet wide and eight inches thick . What these men did was build a horse-drawn gouger , not a cutter , with the left-hand drag merely a marker to keep the rows straight , the right-hand a sharp metal point which scored the ice in a long unbroken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the marker now retracing the line already cut while the metal point scored a parallel line two feet distant from the first . Then , moving the gouger to a position so that it could cut across the two scored lines , the outline of the rectangle was completed . This done , pairs of men with huge trunks of spruce moved along the rectangles , dropping the trunks heavily upon them and breaking them loose into handsome blue-green blocks of ice , which were speedily hauled to the harbor and stacked into the waiting ship . When a hold was filled , with no way open for air to reach the closely packed blocks , heavy matting was tucked over the ice and topped with spruce branches , which formed pockets that would trap what air did seep through the decking . For no more than thirty-two dollars a ton , perfect New Archangel ice could be delivered in San Francisco . Three weeks ahead of schedule , Voronov 's first cargo of ice made its way south , where it sold for an amazing seventy-five dollars a ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen months at least , promised to be more lucrative than peltries . And with the bonanza thus provided , the energetic young assistant administrator launched the building program which would make New Archangel the leading town by far in the North Pacific . He strengthened the palisade , improved his father 's cathedral , made shore improvements to aid vessels , and erected a snowstorm of new buildings : stores , an astronomical observatory , a new library , a Lutheran church with an organ , and on the top floor of the castle , much enlarged , a theater for the presentation of plays or the exhibition of singing and orchestral talent by companies from ships putting into the harbor . By the time all this was completed , New Archangel had accumulated a population of nearly two thousand , not counting the nine hundred Tlingits who still clustered outside the gates , and as Voronov observed at a castle dinner for the local notables : Any talk of selling this place to anyone would be preposterous . ' But in 1856 the Crimean War imposed such a burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her security in Europe , that serious discussions were held at the highest levels of government regarding the practicality of ridding the empire of her far eastern holdings , and whereas from New Archangel , Arkady Voronov was able to submit the most cogent  | reasons why places as promising as Kodiak and New Archangel should be retained , in St. Petersburg , Baranov 's old nemesis Vladimir Ermelov , now an admiral with a lofty if unearned reputation , smothered Arkady 's reasoning with sharp and pertinent official documents : Even if our present position in the Crimea were not so perilous , and even if conditions in North America were more stable and predictable , it would be advisable for His Imperial Majesty to rid himself of the incubus our eastern territories impose . The entire territory called in the popular vernacular Alaska should be sold if possible , given away if necessary . Four basic facts dictate this as the only practical solution . First , Alaska is impossibly distant from the real Russia , months from Okhotsk , many dangerous weeks from Petropavlovsk . Communication by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the next , and by ship dangerous , costly and time-consuming . To send a messenger from St. Petersburg to a place like New Archangel and wait for his return with a reply can take more than a year , and there is no possibility of speeding the process . Second , with the demise of the sea-otter trade , for the animal is practically extinct , there is no feasible way to make money in Alaska . It has no natural resources except trees , and Finland near at hand has much better . It contains no metal reserves , no present trade , no skilled natives to make anything for future trade . It will always be a deficit possession and money will be saved by getting rid of it . Third , conditions in North America are chaotic . The future of both the Canadian territories and the United States is precarious , and one can expect Mexico to launch a war of some kind to win back the territories stolen from her . For us to remain in Alaska is to invite certain trouble from various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important reason till last . Even though the United States shows signs of breaking apart , its citizens also show many signs of wanting to take under their control all of North America , from the North Pole to Panama , and if we retain holdings in that area which they have marked out for themselves , we must sooner or later find ourselves in conflict with that rising power . The United States does n't realize it now , but its more forward-looking citizens already long for Alaska , and in the years ahead that desire will augment . My most fervent advice is that Russia rid herself of this doomed holding now . It is possible that a copy of this report , by clandestine means , found its way into the hands of President James Buchanan , former Secretary of State , with  | a warm regard for Russia which he acquired while serving as ambassador to that country in 1831 . At any rate , by the time the Crimean War drew toward a close , many Americans in high places were aware that Russia was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now one of the more curious developments of world history evolved , almost by accident . On those hilly battlefields in the Crimea , soldiers of many European nations combined to fight against Russia , who stood them off alone . Again and again , outnumbered and outgeneraled , she lost on the battlefield , but in the courts of world opinion she had one stalwart supporter and friend : the United States . At every critical point , America , for reasons never explained , sided with Russia , and let it be known that she was doing so . She strove to prevent an even larger coalition from forming against the tsar . She sent many letters affirming her moral support , and she did nothing to embarrass Russia about the potential sale of Alaska . Of all the nations involved in the Crimean War , even peripherally , the two who formed the warmest alliance were Russia and the United States . So it was natural , when that war ended , that those in Russia who wanted to divest themselves of what they deemed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the period of serious discussion no one in Russia spoke harsh words against the United States as a possible buyer , and had times been normal , it is quite probable that President Buchanan would have completed the sale sometime between 1857 , when his incumbency began , and 1861 , when it ended in the Civil War . That dreadful war , so comprehensive in terrain and devastating in loss of life and disruption of commerce , made any foreign adventure like the purchase of an unknown part of the world impossible . The war dragged on ; money became unavailable for anything else ; and for two desperate years it looked as if the Union would be shattered , leaving no one in authority to talk purchase with Russia . But now the second half of the curious development occurred , for when the fate of the Union seemed most precarious , with European nations eager to pounce on the remains , Russia sent her fleet into American waters , with the implied promise that she would help defend the North against any incursions by European powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into New York harbor , another into San Francisco , and there they waited , saying nothing , making no boasts , just riding at anchor and waiting . Those ships were to the North in 1863 what the American letters of reassurance had been to the Russians in 1856 , not tangible military assistance but perhaps something equally important : the knowledge in dark days that one does not stand alone . When the war ended in the spring of 1865 , the two nations which had supported each other in such times of crisis were prepared to effect the sale that had been discussed over so many years , and it was significant that each nation supposed it was doing the other a favor . The United States thought that Russia had to sell and was seeking a buyer ; Russia was under the impression that everyone in Washington was hungry to grab hold of Alaska . How misinformed the two friends were !  | During both the Crimean and the Civil wars , Arkady Voronov , a mature man now , and his gracious wife , Praskovia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future of their part of Russia were engraved in marble . They refurbished the castle and began living in one of the new wings ; they increased trade with nations of central and western Pacific , like Hawaii and China ; and they improved almost every aspect of colonial life . It was Praskovia 's idea to send promising Creole boys to St. Petersburg for their education , and already some were returning as doctors , teachers or minor administrators . Inspired by the performance of her saintly fatherin-law , she had led the way in imploring monasteries across Russia to contribute the treasure of icons , statues and brocades that now graced the cathedral , making it one of the richest artistically east of Moscow . As if wishing to double the attractiveness of Alaska , St. Petersburg dispatched a dashing young prince to govern it , Prince Dmitri Maksutov , whose title reached back to the days when Tatars from central Asia invaded Russia , giving its people the Asian cast which differentiated them from other Europeans . He was a handsome , able man who had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman whose father taught mathematics at the Naval Academy . After bearing three children , this gracious lady had died prematurely , so that when the prince arrived in Alaska he brought with him a charming young wife named Maria , who , as the daughter of the governor general of Irkutsk , was familiar with Alaskan affairs . She proved to be an ideal princess for this frontier post , a gracious woman interested in everything , and she headed a court in which the locals were honored to participate . During the first day in their new home Prince Dmitri confided his plans to Maria : We 'll be here ten or fifteen years . Make this place a capital in every sense . Then back to St. Petersburg for an additional title and a major promotion . ' The couple had been in residence only briefly when they realized that to attain their ambition , they must rely on some trusted local aide , and it did not take them long to identify the one person qualified to give such assistance . This man Voronov , ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he a Creole ? ' Yes , but his father was chosen by Tsar Nicholas himself to serve as Metropolitan . ' His mother ? Was n't she a native ? ' A saint , they say . You must ask about her , ' and when the princess did , she learned from everyone she asked that Sofia Voronova had indeed been a saint , and she became Arkady 's most ardent supporter . It was she who invited the Voronovs to the Maksutov quarters , and then entertained Praskovia so that their husbands could conduct a serious discussion . It took place at a table bearing a collection of maps , and from the prince 's opening remarks , it was clear that he was determined to translate those lines of the map into a reality they had never before had : Voronov , I am almost  | physically distressed whenever I hear the phrase you used in your last dispatches . ' What , Excellency ? ' Voronov asked with a disarming simplicity , for as the older man and one with an unsullied reputation he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire in the east . " ' I apologize . I do n't seem to understand your objections . ' Island , island ! If St. Petersburg thinks of us as a collection of islands , they 'll think small . But Alaska ' ? he waved his hand toward the unknown mainland ? is a vast land , as grand maybe as all Siberia . ' He slammed his hand down on one of the maps and said : Voronov , I want you to explore that land , to alert St. Petersburg as to what we really have . ' Excellency , ' Voronov said , moving the prince 's hand from the map , I 've already been just where you pointed , ' and he indicated the forbidding land on which the future capital of Juneau would one day stand . It 's just like the land here at New Archangel . A cramped foreshore , then nothing but mountains deep into what must be Canada . ' Impatiently , Maksutov pointed to where the castle stood : We built a fairly good place here . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slim forefinger Voronov indicated the difference : Excellency , the land behind our town is beautiful wooded terrain . The land over there is one vast field of ice , forever frozen , forever throwing glaciers down into the sea . ' For a moment there in the comfort of the castle , Prince Maksutov experienced the stern reality of the land he had been sent to govern , because in various English and German books he had seen engravings which demonstrated what an obliterating force a glacier could be , but he had never suspected that monstrous examples existed less than a hundred miles from where he now sat . But he was not deterred by this knowledge ; he had progressed in government not because he was a prince but rather because he was a stubborn man , and now , surrendering his concept of building a new town on the mainland , he moved his hand boldly to the north to where some enthusiastic Russian cartographer  --  using fragments of information provided on scraps of paper sent to St. Petersburg by ship captains , fur traders and missionaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great , mysterious Yukon River . The prince and Voronov studied this awesome stretch of nearly a hundred miles of shoreline where the Yukon degenerated into a tangle of would-be mouths , some of them finishing as dead ends . From either the river side or the sea , it would be impossible for an uninstructed traveler to identify the proper route , and to send any man , no matter how clever or brave , into that ugly snarl of river , channel and swamp was to condemn him to at least a year of thrashing about , but Maksutov was obdurate . Voronov , I want you to go far up the Yukon . Make sketches . Talk with our people , if you can find them . Tell us what we have . ' Arkady had inherited from his Orthodox ancestors both courage and a sense of commitment to whatever tasks his occupation required , and he now told his superior : I understand that you need to know what goes on up here , ' and with a sweep of his hand he indicated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder if the approach should be through the mouth of the Yukon ? Or better said , the mouths of the Yukon ? ' How else ? ' Maksutov asked , and Voronov evaded the question : Look , Your Excellency , at what happens if I do penetrate that tangle at the mouth ... and who knows if I could identify the proper entrance ? ' While the prince watched attentively , Voronov traced that immense sweep to the south that the Yukon takes at the beginning of its course inland . A man could waste a year picking his way through that morass . ' He could , ' Maksutov agreed , but then he punched his right fist into his left palm , making a sound like a rifle shot : Damn it all , Voronov , I know that priests have gone up the Yukon to a mission outpost called . . . ' He could not remember the name of the place but he did recall hearing that some priest currently reporting to his superiors at the cathedral had made exactly the kind of journey he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispatched to find the man . While they waited , Voronov assured the prince : I want to go . I want to see the Yukon . But I prefer to do it from an orderly approach , ' and Maksutov said : I 'd not have it any other way . ' Now the priest , a bedraggled , incredibly thin fellow with an unkempt beard , watery eyes and of an uncertain age  --  he could have been forty-seven or sixty-seven  --  appeared before the two administrators and fell immediately into profuse apologies , but for what , the two managers could not ascertain . Cutting through the verbiage , the prince asked rather sternly : Name ? ' and the trembling man replied : Father Fyodor Afanasi . ' Is it true you 've been up the Yukon River ? ' Nine years . ' How old are you ? ' Thirty-six , ' and this simple statement told his inquisitors much of what they needed to know about the great river : it made young men old . Dropping his voice to a more congenial level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' and the priest replied : I walked hundreds of miles . ' Now look , you did n't walk up and down the Yukon . It 's a river . ' And most of the year it 's frozen . ' Most of the year ? ' the new chief administrator asked , and Father Fyodor nodded : September to maybe July . ' How far up the river did you go ? ' Five hundred miles . To Nulato . That 's as far as Russian troops have penetrated . ' He hesitated , then added the unpleasant news : It 's only the beginning of our territory , you know . Nulato 's only a short way up the Yukon , really . ' Voronov whistled in amazement , then asked : How would I get to Nulato ? ' and both he and the prince were astonished by what happened next , for the priest  --  after asking meekly May I ? ' ? shuffled through the maps until he found one covering much of the eastern Pacific : Your best approach , sail from New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that both listeners protested : But we want to head north to the Yukon , up this way , ' and on the map they indicated that Sitka Sound lay well to the southeast of the Yukon , whereupon Father  | Fyodor said : ' Of course , but there are no ships going that way . So down you go to San Francisco , about twenty-eight days , then across the ocean to Petropavlovsk . ' ' We do n't want to go to Siberia , ' the prince shouted . ' To the Yukon . ' But that 's the only way to reach the Yukon . About one month in transit . ' Voronov , who was jotting the elapsed time on a slip of paper , noted that he had now been at sea about two months and was still an ocean and a continent away from his target . The priest droned on : From Petropavlovsk you will cross over to this little storm-swept harbor of St. Michael , maybe ten days . ' But that 's nowhere near the Yukon , ' Voronov protested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . I once got laid up there for two months . ' ' Why ? ' Big ships ca n't enter the Yukon . You must wait at St. Michael for a skin boat to take you across the bay and into the Yukon . ' Tracing this dangerous route on the map , he added : Boats capsize trying to make this crossing . ' Rather dry in the mouth , Voronov asked : But now at the end of three months we 're in the river ? ' You are . And with any kind of luck and two months of hard rowing and poling , you may get to Nulato before the Yukon freezes . ' What month are we in ? ' Voronov asked , and the priest said : Everything must be scheduled according to the Yukon . It 's ice-free only briefly . So if you leave New Archangel in late March , you should get to St. Michael in late June , just right for the thaw . That would put you in Nulato safely before the freeze . ' You mean I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice goes out again ? ' Yes . ' When Voronov totted up the time it would take him to get from New Archangel to Nulato and then back , he and Prince Maksutov realized that he would have to be gone at least a year and a half , and just to go from one Alaskan base to another . Both men were appalled . But then Father Fyodor dangled a slight ray of hope : ' I once followed a much different route , ' and Voronov cried : ' I 'd like to hear it ! ' and back to his maps went the priest . ' Same first part . San Francisco , Petropavlovsk , St. Michael . But now , instead of heading south in a riverboat to the Yukon , you head north to this little place Unalakleet . ' On the map this was a dead end , leading to no river , no thoroughfare , and a good sixty miles from the Yukon , which at that point would be heading almost due north , but Father Fyodor relieved their apprehensions by assuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some parts very high , and it intersects the Yukon about here . ' ' How would I negotiate the trail ? ' Voronov asked , and the priest said : ' You 'd walk . ' ' And when I reached the Yukon ? ' ' You 'd be in a party , of course . Have to be , or the Indians might kill you . ' ' Are they like the Tlingits ? ' Voronov asked . ' Worse , ' and with a long finger he pointed to various Russian installations where Eskimos or Athapascans had either murdered everyone or burned  | the place : Most often they did both . Here at St. Michael , many dead . At Nulato , where you want to go , three burnings , same number of murders . Toward the mouth of the Yukon , this little place , two burnings , six murders . ' Voronov cleared his throat and asked : From St. Michael to Nulato by your overland route , how many days ? ' The priest tried to recall his own experiences , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I left St. Michael once on July first , an excellent time except for mosquitoes , and reached Nulato on August fourth . ' Voronov groaned , but then the priest added : Now , if you were willing to trust a dogsled , you would n't have to remain in Nulato for nine months . You could hire a sled , Indians have them and love to travel , and come right down the middle of the frozen Yukon and across the pass to Unalakleet and over to St. Michael . ' At this point Prince Maksutov , increasingly horrified by the difficulties involved in exploring his domain , cut a Gordian knot : Arkady , suppose I diverted one of our ships direct to Petropavlovsk , bypassing San Francisco ? Commandeer a smaller ship there for the run across to this Unalakleet ? Over the mountains on the dogsled , a short , swift visit of inspection at Nulato , and right back down the frozen Yukon , with the ship waiting for you off the mouths of the Yukon ? What would that take ? ' Jotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the briefest delay at each junction point , Voronov announced with some pleasure : Supposing not one day 's delay , about one hundred and fifty days . With normal disappointments , two hundred days . ' But Father Fyodor blasted such plans : Of course , when you reached the sea it would be frozen too , just like the river . ' Till when ? ' Voronov asked , and the priest replied : Same schedule . Solid ice till about July . . . maybe the middle of June , ' and the two administrators groaned . But Prince Maksutov , more determined than ever to have a report on his dominions , told Voronov : We 'll handle it however the ice allows . Pack your bags . ' Arkady saluted , turned to leave , but stopped abruptly to offer a sensible suggestion : Father Fyodor , you know the area . Would you come along to show me the way ? ' and the priest replied enthusiastically : I would love to see my people again . I lived among them nine years , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Yukon he knew were some Isle of Capri , a vacationland basking in the sun . So the trip was scheduled , and Prince Maksutov , fulfilling every promise he had made , diverted a rather smart ship to Petropavlovsk . On it he sent a letter to the commandant there , requesting that Voronov be forwarded speedily across the Bering Sea to St. Michael , but when the time came for departure , Maksutov and Voronov were presented with a problem no one had anticipated : Praskovia Voronova announced that she would be accompanying her husband to Nulato . This occasioned much turmoil , for although Arkady was delighted with the prospect of having his intelligent and energetic wife along , Prince Maksutov put his foot down : The Yukon is no place for a lady ! ' And there matters stood , until the impasse was resolved by strong advice  | from an unexpected quarter . Father Fyodor , hearing of the argument , announced in what was for him a bold voice : A woman on the Yukon ? Splendid ! The men would be delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ? ' Maksutov shouted , and the priest replied : ' Precisely ! It 's in His name I make the suggestion . Our Athapascan women should be allowed to see how a Christian woman lives . ' Then , blushing , he added : How she looks , ' and it was agreed that Praskovia would join the expedition . New Archangel  --  Petropavlovsk  --  St. Michael  --  Unalakleet , it was a journey to two continents , half a dozen cultures . The travelers passed great glaciers , a score of volcanoes , whales and walruses , terns and puffins , until they reached a bleak and barren shore where Father Fyodor spent three hectic days trying to find a team of natives to serve as porters while they crossed the high country leading to the Yukon . As the Voronovs traversed this barren but exciting land marked by low mountains , they learned how overwhelmingly vast inland Alaska was and how ferocious its mosquitoes , for at times they settled upon the travelers like a flock of sea gulls descending upon a dying fish . What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in despair , and the priest said : Nothing . In six weeks they go away . If this were September , you would n't be bothered at all . ' After they had been on the trail some days , one of the Indians who spoke Russian said : Tomorrow , maybe , the Yukon , ' and the Voronovs rose early for their first glimpse of this great river whose name so fascinated geographers and others who speculated on the nature of the earth . It 's a magical word , ' Arkady told the priest as they breakfasted on smoked salmon , but Father Fyodor corrected him : It 's a brutal word . It 's a river that never allows you to travel it easily . ' But Voronov could not be discouraged by the reports of another man , so after breakfast he and Praskovia rushed ahead , and at the conclusion of a hard climb , reached a point from which they could look down into the broad valley that opened up below them . Since the mists which obscured it from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great and powerful river , twice as wide as they had expected , much lighter in color because of the monstrous load of sand and silt it brought down from distant mountains . It 's so big ! ' Arkady cried to Father Fyodor as the priest puffed up to the vantage point , but when the latter saw his old friend , his nemesis , he said matter-of-factly : In spate I 've seen it reach from that hill to this one . And in late spring when the ice breaks up , chunks as big as a house come sailing right down the middle , and heaven help whatever they strike . ' The Voronovs remained on the hill till the rest of their party had passed , speculating on what the river must look like a thousand miles farther up , where the Canadians , those mysterious people the Russians never saw , had their footholds . They were enchanted by the Yukon , awed by its turbulent power and mesmerized by its incessant flow , this messenger from frozen lands , this symbol of Alaska .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see enough of it before we leave , ' and this frank assessment was proved accurate when the party descended to the level of the river and started up its right bank , for their way was constantly impeded by many small rivulets that wandered down from the north to join the great stream ; to cross these required wading , and since one seemed to appear each half-hour , the Voronovs had wet feet most of that first day , but at dusk they approached the small but important settlement of Kaltag , where dogs began barking as children screamed : Father Fyodor ! He comes back ! ' In the explosive moments that followed , the Voronovs gained a completely different impression of what life in central Alaska could be , for they were surrounded by a new kind of native , the taller , sturdier Athapascans whose ancestors had reached Alaska long before either the Eskimo or the Aleut and who served as progenitors to the Tlingits . Like the latter , they were a warlike lot , but when they saw that their onetime priest , Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries and presents and manifold expressions of their love . For two exciting days the travelers remained in the village , with the Voronovs getting an idea of what it was like to be a missionary on the frontier . During this time Arkady had an opportunity to witness the wisdom of Father Fyodor 's strange statement when Prince Maksutov objected to Praskovia 's joining the expedition : Our Athapascan women should be allowed to see how a Christian woman lives , ' for the Kaltag women trailed along with Praskovia wherever she went , marveling at her appearance and joining with her when she laughed . Those who spoke Russian asked innumerable questions , wanting to know specifically : Is your bright hair real ? ' and Why is it so different from ours ? ' and from the direct manner in which she answered even their most personal questions , they knew that she respected them and was meeting them as equals , and this friendliness encouraged them to ask more questions . Arkady , watching her performance , said to himself : She likes this village and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of her willingness to see and accept Alaska as it was . When he mentioned this to her after one of her sessions with the women , she cried : I do love this strange land . I think I now understand Alaska . ' On the morning of the third day , when they were about to depart , Praskovia , with her practiced woman 's eye , noticed that one Athapascan , no longer a girl but not yet a woman , was taking a special interest in the priest , bringing him the best bits of food and protecting him from the importunities of the children . Praskovia began studying the young woman , noticing her handsome carriage , the subtle coloring of her skin , the attractive way she wore her hair in braids , and she thought : That one was meant to be the mother of children , the custodian of a house . So when the time came to leave the village , she went to Father Fyodor and said : That girl , the smiling one , she 'd make a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Praskovia pointed , and said , as if he had never seen the woman before : Yes . Yes , it 's about time she was finding herself a husband , ' and he nodded to Praskovia as if thanking her for her sensible suggestion .  | The journey up the Yukon to Nulato required three days , and they were days the Voronovs would never forget , for as they progressed northward the river broadened out until it reached a mile and a half from bank to bank , a massive stretch of water pressing always toward the distant ocean , which now lay nearly five hundred miles away , counting all the twists and turns . On the bosom of the river , which seemed to move past the boat with rugged determination , the Voronovs felt themselves to be entering the heartland of a great continent , a feeling totally different from any they had previously experienced in their gentler part of Alaska where islands and stretches of open sea predominated . Look at those empty fields ! ' Praskovia cried , pointing to the land that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch off to infinity . A field , ' her husband said reflectively , makes you think of orderliness , as if someone had fenced in an area and tended it . The land up here goes on forever . ' It did , and across much of it no human being had ever moved , and as they contemplated its awesome immensity the Voronovs began to comprehend the terrain they governed . For long stretches there would be no trees , no hills , no animals moving , not even any snow , just the boundless emptiness , so lonely and forbidding that Praskovia whispered : I 'll wager there are n't even any mosquitoes out there , ' and Arkady asked : You want us to let you off ? Test your theory ? ' and she cried : No ! No ! ' Yet in a perverse way it was the brutal nothingness of this trip up the Yukon that enchanted the Voronovs . This is n't a garden along the Neva , ' Arkady said , anticipating the sentiments of those thousands of men from all corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty spaces of Alaska . They would deplore the loneliness , the difficulties of travel and the dreadful experience of fifty-five degrees below zero , but they would also revel in the fact that they had been able to withstand and conquer this gigantic , forbidding land , and fifty years later , as their lives drew to conclusion , they would cherish above all their other accomplishments the fact that I traveled the Yukon . ' Toward the close of their third day on the river the Voronovs saw around a bend a sight which caused them to cheer : the tight little fort of Nulato , its two wooden towers defying the world , a Russian flag flying from a central pole . As they drew close and men ashore began firing salutes from rusty guns and an ancient cannon , Arkady felt a surge of emotion : This is the last outpost of empire . My God , I 'm glad we came . ' The garrison , some twenty Russian traders and soldiers , were as delighted to see their old friend Father Fyodor as the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embrace him , but when they did so , they stared in amazement to find that a woman , and a pretty one at that , had come so far up the Yukon , and when Praskovia tried to debark , four men reached for her , lifted her high in the air , and with shouts and imitated bugle calls carried her into the fort , while her husband trailed behind , informing the garrison commander of his official position in the government and his interest in their fort . It was a rough , frontier stronghold perched well back from the right bank of the Yukon , but so located as to command far reaches of the river in all  | directions . Built in the classic form of four lengths of long buildings joined to enclose a rather spacious central square , it was dominated by the two stalwart towers and protected by a double-strength palisade which surrounded the entire structure . Having been overrun three times in the past , with considerable loss of Russian lives , it was not going to be an easy target in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each tower ; two at night . After samovars bubbled with hot tea , and toasts were drunk , and garrison members reported on their experiences with the surrounding Athapascans , a fierce lot according to them , the commanding officer , an energetic cleanshaven young lieutenant named Greko , signaled one of his men , who blushed , stepped forward , bowed to the Voronovs , and said : ' Gracious visitors , this humble fort at the edge of the world is honored by your presence . As a token of our respect , Lieutenant Greko and his men have prepared a special treat . ' At this point he broke into uncontrollable laughter , which left the visitors bewildered , but now Greko took over . ' It was that rascal 's idea , not mine , ' he said , pointing to the young fellow , whom he now punched in the arm : ' Go ahead , Pekarsky , tell them what you and those others did , ' and Pekarsky , after holding his hand over his mouth to stop his laughter , straightened up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butler 's manner : Come this way , monsieur et madame , ' but the French , proving too much to handle under the circumstances , threw him into such convulsions that Lieutenant Greko had to intervene . The men have paid you a great honor , Excellency . I 'm proud of them , ' and he led the way out of the meeting and into the square , where soldiers , still hungry for a glimpse of the beautiful woman from Moscow , stared and nudged one another as she passed , her golden hair glowing in the darkness . They went to a low building outside of which lay stacked a huge pile of logs , which had been cut far upstream and floated here . Voila ! ' the young officer cried , and when he pulled open the door the Voronovs found themselves entering a typical thick-walled Russian bath , with an outer room in which to undress , a very small middle area nearly filled with logs , and an inner room lined with low benches facing a collection of red-hot rocks heated by wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water to be thrown on the rocks to provide clouds of steam , so that within minutes of starting a bath , one would be engulfed in a cleansing , relaxing vapor . ' We could not maintain a fort here without this , ' Greko said , and he bowed to his distinguished guests and departed . The promise of a good steam bath was so inviting that the two Voronovs almost raced to see who would reach it first , and when Praskovia won , for she had no high boots to unlace , she cried : ' Heaven at the end of an arctic trip ! ' and her husband replied with that accuracy which can be so infuriating : ' We 're a hundred and twenty-one miles south of the Circle . I checked , ' but as the steam rose about them she replied : ' It 's arctic to me . I could feel the river preparing to freeze , ' and without warning she burst into tears . ' Darling ? ' ' It 's been so wonderful , Arkady . There we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful volcano thinking we were in Alaska . I 'm so glad  | you brought me . ' She wept for some moments , then took her husband 's hand : When we were on the river I had the feeling that we were heading into eternity . But then I saw the soldiers come running down to embrace Father Fyodor , and I realized that people lived here and that eternity was somewhere far beyond . ' Her tears stopped , and she said : Quite far beyond , I think . ' Greko corrected him . You 'd be right if this were the beginning of summer . Easy ride . Pleasant , really . But this is autumn . ' If we started right away ? ' Fine . River 's open here and it remains open for some time . But at the mouth it freezes early . The cold winds coming in from Asia hit there first . ' Allowing time for these facts to register , he then said : Excellency , if you and Madame were to leave here now , you might very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be , eight months in an arctic winter with no possible chance of escape . ' Arkady called for his wife to join him so that she could hear the lieutenant 's warning , and long before Greko finished , she blurted out : We 'll stay till the river freezes . Then return the way we came , ' and Greko , hoping to forestall any reconsiderations , jumped at the suggestion : Good ! You 'll be most welcome here and we 'll have time to find you a first-class dog team for the return . ' So the Voronovs , he the son of the Metropolitan of All the Russias , she the daughter of a socially prominent family in Moscow , dug in for the opening days of a real Alaskan winter , and they watched with fascination as the thermometer began its steady and sometimes precipitous descent . u One morning Praskovia wakened her husband with a rough shake : The Yukon 's freezing ! ' and they spent that whole day watching as ice formed along the shores , then broke away , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not freeze . 1 But three days later , in mid-October when the thermometer suddenly plunged to three degrees above zero , the mighty river surrendered and ice began to rush across from shore to shore as if it operated under directions of its own , and two days later the Yukon was frozen . Then came the exacting days of testing to see how thick the ice was , and Lieutenant Greko explained that no matter how cold it became , the bottom of the Yukon never froze : The current below and the protection of the snow on top prevent the cold from taking command . In mid-January it 'll still be flowing down there . ' She had been correct about the coming of winter , for after they had explored this part of the Yukon , going some twenty miles farther on to where a large river debouched from the north , and after they had met with members of various Athapascan tribes coming to the fort to trade , Arkady announced one morning : I think we 're ready to head downstream , ' and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than poling 11 against it , the five-hundred-mile trip could be made speedily , but Lieutenant  | When various teams of dogs were brought in , Praskovia found delight in making their acquaintance : big gray-brown malamutes , white Eskimo dogs , mongrels with powerful bodies and inexhaustible energy , and others the Russians called huskies . They were dogs unlike any she had known in Russia , and although some snarled when she approached , others recognized her as a friend and showed their appreciation for her attention . But none became pets , nor did she try to make them so ; these were noble animals bred for a particular purpose , and without them life in the arctic would have been difficult . She found that she was loving the experience of extreme cold , but one night when the mercury thermometer dropped to minus-forty-two and quit , she was stunned by the force of weather at such temperatures , the way icy air sped down into the lungs , almost freezing them , and the curious manner in which a face could be fairly comfortable one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thermometer could not register below the low forties , she asked Greko what the actual temperature was , and he consulted his spirit thermometer and said : ' Minus-fifty-three , ' and when she asked : ' Why do n't I feel it to be that cold ? ' he said : ' No wind . No humidity . Just this heavy , heavy cold weighting everything down . ' It did not weigh her down . Every day she ran and leaped outside the fort , and not until she had exhausted herself , and felt the cold threaten her very bones , did she hurry inside . ' If I stayed out there , ' she asked Greko , ' how long before I 'd freeze ? ' and he called to a soldier , who showed her his wrecked ears and a big white scarlike place on his right cheek . ' How long did that take ? ' Greko asked , and the man said : ' Twenty minutes , about as cold as this . ' ' Is your face permanently damaged ? ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are gone , the face will be all right , maybe a brown spot later on . ' That night , in the heart of Alaska that few Russians would ever know , she had the most exciting experience of all , for over the fort at Nulato , where twenty-two Russians huddled against the bitter cold , the northern lights began their heaven-encompassing dance . The Voronovs joined Lieutenant Greko in the center of the frozen square , inside the protection of the wooden barracks and the double palisade , and there they watched the great ebb and flow of the colored lights as they pranced across the midnightdarkened sky . ' How cold is it now ? ' Praskovia asked , and Greko said : ' Maybe sixty-below , ' but the Voronovs only huddled deeper within their furs , for they did not want to move inside while this fantastic performance filled the heavens . Later , as they drank tea and precious brandy with Greko , Praskovia said : ' We 've seen Alaska . Without your help we might never have known it existed , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much that none of us has seen , ' and he agreed that on the day after tomorrow they could safely begin their journey back toward Sitka Sound . There was an abrupt change in plans on the return journey , but it had only happy consequences . When they reached the village of Kaltag , where they  | would have to leave the frozen river in order to take the hill route to Unalakleet , Father Fyodor informed them , with embarrassment : I 'll be staying here . They need a priest . ' Arkady , although distressed at the prospect of continuing what was a dangerous journey without Father Fyodor 's help , had witnessed the admirable manner in which this scarecrow of a man fitted into Yukon life , and he had to consent . Will you explain to the religious authorities at the capital ? ' the priest asked , and Arkady said : I can see this village needs you , ' and was about to express his appreciation for the help he had given the party , when Praskovia marched up , holding by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earlier visit . Going to the priest , she said : You proved yourself to be a dear , good man , Father . But you 'd be twice as effective with a wife , ' and she placed the young woman 's hand in his . When it was understood by everyone , even the children , that Father Fyodor was taking a wife and staying in their village , the young bride said firmly : It would be wrong to make the Russian couple cross the mountains by themselves ! ' And with the help of her father she arranged for a team of dogsled men to carry the Voronovs and the priest and his bride across snow and ice to where the Voronovs would wait for the thaw and a ship that would take them back to New Archangel . As their ship pulled into Sitka Sound the Voronovs saw running down from the castle , in a manner quite undignified for a noble chief administrator , the agitated figure of Prince Maksutov , who shouted , as soon as he saw the Voronovs : Go over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course to pull alongside the merchant steamer , they saw Maksutov jumping into a small boat , which two sailors rowed to the English vessel . When the Voronovs climbed aboard the visiting ship , they waited at the railing for Maksutov to join them , and when he did they saw that he was ashen-faced . I want you to hear the news they 've brought ! ' and he hurried them toward the captain 's quarters , where they were met by a plump , jovial Scotsman who introduced himself : Captain MacRae , Glasgow . ' In a fevered rush Prince Maksutov presented his two guests , then blurted out : Tell them what you told me , ' and Captain MacRae said : It 's such a bizarre story I 'd like to have young Henderson along . He heard it first and checked it out after I 'd heard it from a different source . ' So while Henderson was sent for , the Voronovs waited , quite in the dark as to what had been happening during their long absence . Probably England and Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Henderson appeared to stand beside his captain , the two Britons delivered quite a different story . It seems , ' Captain MacRae began , and we have it on unimpeachable authority both from the Americans in San Francisco and our consul there , that Russia has sold Alaska  --  land , company , buildings , ships , everything ? to the Americans . ' Sold ? ' Voronov gasped . Long ago he and Praskovia had heard rumors of a possible sale , but that was when Russia had her back to the wall in the  | Crimea and needed money . To sell now would be insane . He and his wife had just seen the grandeur and promise of Alaska , and could not imagine losing such a treasure . His agile mind leaped from one possibility to the next . In the end he asked an almost insulting question : Prince Maksutov , how do we know that these two men are not saying this to put us to some disadvantage ? I mean , if there 's war between our nations ? ' As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his question had been , and he turned to the two British officers and apologized . Not at all ! ' MacRae said , his round face beaming . This gentleman is quite right . All we 've brought you , as I warned you before , Prince , is a San Francisco rumor . A very solid one , as I said , but only a rumor until you receive official confirmation from your own people . ' He invited the Russians to stay , then ordered a steward to bring drinks for everyone , and as the Voronovs sat in stunned silence , MacRae said almost jovially : Henderson here gave a damned good account of himself in the Crimea . Said you chaps were mighty handy with your heavy guns . ' For some time they talked about the affair at Balaklava as if it had been a cricket match played in the distant past with no rancor left behind , but when that gracious interlude ended , Voronov addressed Henderson : ' Please , sir , would you share with my wife and me exactly what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a San Francisco waterfront saloon of the better type , with officers from another British ship and a French , when an American businessman asked : ' Any of you Johnnies headed for Sitka ? I suppose you know it belongs to America now ? ' Henderson said that since his ship was heading for Alaska , he asked to know more , and a general discussion evolved into which several Americans were brought , and two of them had knowledge of the sale . Henderson had then run back to his ship to alert Captain MacRae , who did not believe the yarn but who did hurry to the British consul , who said that although he had no solid knowledge of the transaction , he had been forewarned in the pouch from Washington that the sale had been confirmed by the American political leaders and that the price agreed upon had been $7,200,000 . Good God , ' Voronov gasped . How many rubles is that ? ' ' A little better than two to one , maybe eleven , twelve million rubles . ' Good God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much . ' Have you been to the Yukon ? ' MacRae asked , and Praskovia replied : ' Far up . It 's a treasure , and I refuse to believe it 's been sold . ' MacRae , feeling sympathy for the difficult problems facing these Russians so far from home , invited them to join him for tiffin , during which he did his best to relax their tensions , but when he asked them what they might do if the rumors proved true , he received two sharply different answers . Prince Maksutov said with diplomatic propriety : I 'm an official of the government . I 'd stay here to effect an orderly transfer , salute as our flag came down , then sail home . ' You would n't protest the action ? ' ' Six times in the past three years I 've advised St. Petersburg to hold on p 300 to Alaska . If a contrary decision 's been made , as you suggest , I 'll have no more to say . ' But you would n't continue to live here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Realizing the pejorative nature of that comment to a representative of a third power , he added : Nor under anybody else , including you British . ' MacRae , appreciating the reason for the correction , said : I 'd feel the same way . ' But now Praskovia broke in : Leave this lovely place ? Never ! ' You 'd surrender your Russian citizenship ? ' Arkady , hoping to forestall an answer his wife might later regret , interrupted : How can we predict what the rules will be ? If America has bought Alaska , she might want to kick us all out , so your question is premature . ' Not at all ! ' strong-willed Praskovia snapped . America needs people . So much empty space . So many of their men killed in the war . They 'll be begging us to stay . ' Looking at each of her listeners in turn , she added : And the Voronovs will be staying . We 've made this our home . ' After she launched this challenge , the fire went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : You did a terrible thing , sir , when you sent us to Fort Nulato . You allowed us to see Alaska . And we fell in love with it . Here we shall stay to speed its development , and I wo n't give a damn who owns it . ' Bravo ! ' MacRae cried . I 'll toast you both on later trips . ' Trying her best to smile at this levity , she failed miserably , dropped her face into her hands , and wept . The transfer of Alaska from Russia to the United States formed one of those unbelievable incidents of history , because by 1867 , Russia was nervously eager to get rid of it , while the United States , still recovering from the Civil War and immersed in the impending impeachment of President Johnson , refused to accept it on any terms . At this impasse an extraordinary man monopolized center stage . He was not a Russian , a fact which would become important more than a century later , but a soi-disant baron of dubious background , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up in 1841 for temporary duty representing Russia in the United States and who lingered there till 1868 . In that time Edouard de Stoeckl , parading himself as a nobleman , although no one could say for sure how or when or even if he had earned his title , became such an ardent friend of America that he married an American heiress and took upon himself the task of acting as marriage broker between Russia , which he called his homeland , and the United States , his adopted residence . He faced a most difficult task , for when the United States showed hesitancy about accepting Alaska , support for the sale withered in Russia , and later when Russia wanted to sell , half a dozen of the most influential American politicians led by Secretary of State William Seward of New York looked far into the future and saw the desirability of acquiring Alaska to serve as America 's arctic bastion , yet the hardheaded businessmen in the Senate , the House and the general public opposed the purchase with all the  | scorn they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Folly ' were two of the gentler jibes . Some critics accused Seward of being in the pay of the Russians ; others accused De Stoeckl of buying votes in the House . One sharp satirist claimed that Alaska contained nothing but polar bears and Eskimos , and many protested that America should not accept this useless , frozen domain even if Russia wanted to give it away . Many pointed out that Alaska had no wealth of any kind , not even reindeer , which proliferated in other northern areas , and experts affirmed that an arctic area like this could not possibly have any minerals or other deposits of value . On and on went the abuse of this unknown and somewhat terrifying land , and the castigations would have been comical had they not influenced American thinking and behavior and condemned Alaska to decades of neglect . But an ingenious man like Baron de Stoeckl was not easily diverted from his main target , and with Seward 's unflinching support and admirable statesmanship , the sale squeaked by with a favorable margin of one vote . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to losing one of her potentially valuable acquisitions , but of course , had one viewed Alaska from the vantage point of frozen Fort Nulato in 1867 , with the thermometer at minus-fifty-seven and about to be attacked by hostile Athapascans , the purchase at more than $7,000,000 would have seemed a poor bargain . Now the comedy intensified , became burlesque , for although the U.S. Senate had bought the place , the U.S. House refused to appropriate the money to pay for it , and for many tense months the sale hung in the balance . When a favorable vote was finally taken , it was almost negated by the discovery that Baron de Stoeckl had disposed of $125,000 in cash for which he refused to give an accounting . Widely suspected of having bribed congressmen to vote for land that was obviously worthless , the baron waited until the sale was completed , then quietly slipped out of the country , his life 's ambition having been achieved . One congressman with a keen sense of history , economics and geopolitics said of the whole affair : If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the help she gave us during the Civil War , why did n't we give her the seven million and tell her to keep her damned colony ? It 'll never be of any use to us . ' So the sale was completed and the scene of the comedy moved to San Francisco , where a fiery Northern general named Jefferson C. Davis  --  no relative of the president of the Confederacy  --  was informed that Alaska was now American property and that he , Davis , was in command of the icebergs , the polar bears and the Indians . A short-tempered man who during the Civil War had gunned down a Northern general to whom he had taken it dislike  --  the other general died and Davis was forgiven on the grounds that he , Davis , did have a short temper  --  he had spent the postwar years : Lasing Indians on the Plains , and accepted his job in Alaska under the Impression that his duty there would be to continue chasing Indians . On 18 September 1867 the steamer John L. Stevens sailed from San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to govern  | Alaska for the ensuing decades . One who left that day wrote a dismal account : As we marched in battle gear to our waiting ship , no maidens stood on the corners to throw roses at us and no enthusiastic crowds gathered to cheer us on our way . The public was so disgusted with our purchase of Alaska that they showed only contempt as we passed . One man shouted directly at me : Give it back to Russia ! ' When the Stevens reached Sitka a holy mess developed . The Russians follow a calendar which is eleven days behind ours , so everything was confused . Also , in Alaska they keep the Moscow day , which is one ahead of ours . You figure that out . At any rate , when we arrived the Russian commander said : You 're here early . This is still Russia and no foreign troops can land till the American commissioners arrive , ' and we poor soldiers have had to stay in our stinking ship 's quarters ten days looking at a volcano off our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't like volcanoes and I certainly do n't like Alaska . Finally , the ship bearing the American commissioners came into the sound , and now the troops were permitted , belatedly , to land ; they were a grumbling unhappy lot , but soon they were engaged in the formality of transfer , which to everyone 's surprise took place that very afternoon . It was not a well-managed affair . Prince Maksutov , who could have handled it beautifully , was prevented from doing so by the presence of a stuffy minor official sent from Russia to represent the tsar , while Arkady Voronov , who knew more about the Russian holdings than anyone else , was not allowed to participate at all . There was , however , a certain formality that pleased the few people who climbed the eighty steps to Baranov 's Castle , where the Russian flag streamed from a ninety-foot pole made from a Sitka spruce . There were cannon salutes from the bay and a proper ceremony for the lowering of one flag and the raising of another , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Praskovia Voronova in a letter home : Although we had already signified our intention of becoming American citizens , Arkady , as you would expect , wanted the farewell Russian performance carried out with proper dignity , as would befit the honor of a great empire . He rehearsed our Russian soldiers with great care in the lowering of our flag and I helped mend torn uniforms and supervised the polishing of shoes . I must say that our troops looked pipe-clay neat when Arkady and I were finished . Alas , it came to naught . For when one of our most reliable men pulled the halyards to lower our glorious flag , a sudden gust of wind whipped it about the flagpole , fastening it so tightly that nothing could be done to dislodge it . The poor man with the rope  | looked woefully at Arkady , who indicated with his hands that he should give it a good tug . He obeyed , but succeeded only in ripping off the bunting which decorated the flag and tightening the flag even more securely to the pole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to loosen that flag , and I almost broke into cheers , thinking it to be an omen that the sale would not take effect . At this point Arkady left me , swearing under his breath , and I heard him tell two of his men : Get that damned thing down . Now ! ' They had no idea of how this could be done , and I am humiliated to confess that it was an American sailor who called out : Rig up a bosun 's chair ! ' I could n't see how this was done , but pretty soon a man was clambering up the pole like a monkey on a rope , and he broke our flag loose , tearing it further in his haste . Freed at last , it fell ignominiously earthward , where it landed on the heads of our men , who failed to catch it in their hands , and then it became mixed up in their bayonets . I was mortified . Arkady continued to swear , something he rarely does , Prince Maksutov looked straight ahead as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty wife fainted . I wept . Arkady and I are determined to remain here in Sitka , as it is now to be called , and to be the best citizens we can be of our new nation . He is staying because his mother and father had such close associations with these islands , and I shall stay because I have grown to love Alaska and its enormous potential , and when you come to visit us next year I believe you will see a city twice this size and twice as prosperous , for they assure us that when America assumes control , it will pour millions of dollars in here to make this a major possession . It was not premature for Praskovia and the other Russians who were selecting American citizenship to announce their choice , because in the days before the transfer , Prince Maksutov had assembled the heads of families and explained in glowing terms the Russian-American treaty which would govern such matters . Standing in his crisp white officer 's uniform and smiling warmly , he was obviously proud of the work his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent rules they 've agreed to . Great statesmanship , really . ' When a young teacher from the local college , one Maxim Luzhin , asked for details , Maksutov patiently explained : I helped draft the regulations , so I can assure you that you 'll be fully protected , however you choose . ' ' For example ? ' Luzhin pressed , and the prince said : If you want to go hack to Russia , you can do so anytime within three years . We 'll provide free transportation to your home district . If you elect to remain here and become A mericans , your new government promises you full citizenship automatically , no restraints because you 're Russian , and complete freedom of religion . ' Smiling at people who trusted him , he told them honestly : Not often  | in life do you get two choices , each one excellent . Choose as you wish . You ca n't go wrong . ' So when the Voronovs participated in the transfer ceremonies they did so as American citizens , but their transition into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner had the American flag risen to the top of the pole on that first day than General Davis issued a startling order : All Russians on the hill to vacate their quarters before sunset ! ' and a major directed his soldiers to occupy the buildings . Arkady went to the major , and in a quiet , respectful voice , explained : My wife and I have elected American citizenship . Our home is up there , ' and he pointed to their quarters atop the castle . You 're Russian , are n't you ? ' the major growled . Out by sunset . I 'm taking those rooms . ' When Voronov , burning with indignation , informed his wife of the order , she laughed : The prince and princess have been tossed out of their quarters , too . General Davis wants their rooms . ' I ca n't believe it . ' Look at the servants , ' and Arkady saw the Maksutov possessions being toted down the hill . The Voronovs moved their goods into a small cottage near the cathedral , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who had enjoyed their life in Sitka longed to remain , willing like the Voronovs to trust their fate to American generosity , but friends in Russia applied such strong pressure for them to return home that most decided to sail on whatever steamer arrived to carry them to Petropavlovsk . What will happen to them when they get to Russia ? ' Praskovia asked , and Arkady replied : I would n't like to guess . ' But now distraught neighbors , unable to decide for themselves , came to the Voronov cottage , asking Arkady what to do , and usually he advised : Go home . ' And if a husband and wife differed in their choice , he invariably counseled a return to Russia : There you know what your neighbors are going to do . ' This repeated recommendation that people who harbored doubts should go back to Russia had a surprising effect on him , for although he had started with a firm resolve to stay in Alaska , his constant projection of himself into the minds and conditions of others revealed how insecure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Praskovia walked home from a meeting with the Maksutovs , who were reconciled to returning home and perhaps even eager to do so , Arkady said without warning : Praska , are we doing the right thing ? ' and she temporized , wishing to know the full range of his doubts : What do you mean , Arkady ? ' and he revealed his uncertainty : It 's a fearful decision , really . The rest of our lives . We do n't know Russia anymore , we 've been away so long . And we do n't know America , because we ca n't predict how they 'll behave ten years from now . . . or even now , for that matter . This General Davis ? I wonder if he has any concept of what Alaska is . I wonder if he 's very bright . ' I 'm certainly not impressed with his first decisions , ' Praskovia said , but he may get better . ' She encouraged her husband to spread out all his fears , and as he ventilated them she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any people their age should consider when making a decision of such gravity : Go on , what 's your greatest fear ? ' and he said gravely : That it 's the last big choice we 'll ever make . Not for me , really . I was never attached to Russia , you know . I 'm from the islands . But you . . . ' and he looked at her with the great love which had always been the mark of Voronov men . His great-grandfather and his grandfather , both in Irkutsk , had enjoyed the good fortune of loving their wives . His father , Vasili , had found in the islands a love with his Aleut bride that few men know , and he had been the same . From the first moment he saw Praskovia during his student days in the capital he had loved only her , and now he feared that he might be behaving as his father had done when he surrendered Sofia Kuchovskaya in order to accept soaring promotion in the church . He was thinking of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : I 'm an island man . I 'm forcing you into a cruel choice . ' She did not laugh , or even smile at his ingenuousness , but she did take him by the arm and lead him toward the cathedral , where they entered together to find rude chairs in the back among the shadows , and there she informed him as to her vision of the future : Arkady , you 're sixty-six . I 'm fifty-eight . How many years are we gambling on this thing ? Not many . An error , if we make one , wo n't be the wastage of an entire life . ' Before he could respond , she said with great force : At Nulato , watching the Yukon sweep past , feeling the immense cold , getting to know those sled dogs and seeing how Father Fyodor was greeted in the villages . . . ' She smiled and squeezed his hand : I made my choice then , whether Alaska remained Russian or not . This is my home . I want to be here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could speak , she concluded : Arkady , I do believe that if you elected to go home to Russia , I might stay here by myself . ' Then she added in a confidential whisper : Truth is , but do n't tell the prince , I actually prefer their American name Sitka to the Russian name New Archangel . ' After that revealing moment , Arkady stopped advising anyone what to do , nor did he volunteer any information as to what Praskovia and he would do when the first ship sailed , the one that would take Prince Maksutov and his wife away . Instead , the Voronovs bought a somewhat larger house that was being vacated by a family heading home , and in it they began accumulating those comfortable odds and ends that would mean so much to them when Sitka became a totally American city . It 's to be a wonderful new life , ' Praskovia said , but Arkady , who was witnessing each day the inability of the Americans to govern their new possession , had additional reasons for apprehension . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maksutovs held a farewell dinner party to thank those trusted friends who had worked so hard for Russia but who now elected to become American citizens . I can not challenge your decisions , ' he said gently , but I pray you will serve your new homeland honorably . ' He explained that although he must remain two more weeks to complete the transfer , his wife would be sailing on the morrow . And then nature pulled a cruel trick . During these weeks of departure Sitka 's normal fog and gloom had established a mood proper for  | farewell , but on the final day the mists lifted , revealing Sitka in its refulgent grandeur : there stood the noble volcano , the rim of snow-clad mountains , the myriad green islands , the green onion dome of the Orthodox cathedral , the trim neatness of the most congenial port in Russian America . Oh , Praska ! ' the princess cried as she embraced her friend . We 're throwing away the most beautiful town in the Russian Empire , ' and it was in bitterness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed an honor guard for Prince Maksutov as he marched in dignity down the hill to where a small boat waited to ferry him to his waiting ship : I leave Alaska in the hands of you Voronovs . You know it better than anyone else . ' From atop the hill , General Davis , now ruling from Baranov 's Castle , ordered a salute to be fired , and as the echoes reverberated through the mountains and valleys of Sitka , the Russian Empire in Alaska came to an end . The United States assumed responsibility for Alaska on 18 October 1867 , and by early January 1868 it was apparent to the Voronovs and the Luzhins that no sensible form of government  --  indeed , none at all , sensible or ridiculous  --  was going to be installed . General Davis and his soldiers were supposed to be in charge , but only a part of the blame could be placed on them . The fault lay with the American Congress , which , remembering the irresponsible oratory opposing the purchase of Alaska , had claimed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention . So , incredible as it would seem to later historians , America refused to give Alaska any form of government . It refused even to give it a proper name : in 1867 it was called the Military District of Alaska ; in 1868 , the Department of Alaska ; in 1877 , the Customs District of Alaska ; and in 1884 , simply the District of Alaska . From the first day of ownership it should have been designated the Territory of Alaska , but that would have presupposed eventual statehood , and orators opposing the suggestion ranted : That icebox will never have enough population to warrant statehood , ' so the area was initially denied the step-by-step learning experience of first being an unorganized territory with judges and sheriffs , then an organized one with its own legislature and emerging government , and finally a full-fledged state . Why were normal rights denied the area ? Because businessmen , saloonkeepers , trappers , miners and fishermen demanded a free hand in garnering the riches of Alaska and feared that any form of local self-government might pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would remain America 's blind spot . No matter what happened here ? what riches were uncovered , what triumphs achieved  --  the American people and their government would not believe . For generations this treasure would be left to float adrift in icy seas , like an abandoned ship whose planking slowly rotted . By mid-January , Arkady Voronov began to fear that a kind of creeping paralysis had engulfed Sitka and the rest of Alaska , but he did not appreciate the depth of the confusion until he talked with the young teacher Maxim Luzhin : Arkady , you ca n't imagine the situation ! An enthusiastic  | businessman from California came north on the ship that brought the troops . He wants to move here and open some kind of trading business . But he ca n't buy land for a home and office because there is no land law . And he ca n't start his business because there is no business law . If he settles here , he ca n't leave his property to his children , for there is no office to legalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked into other impediments , they were told : You ca n't call upon the sheriff to protect your rights , because there is no sheriff , no jail and no court to appeal to for redress , for there is no court , which is understandable , because there is no real judge . ' Together the two men climbed the hill to inform General Davis of the concern the Russians had for their safety amid such chaos , and when they met him at ease in his quarters , they were struck by how handsome and military he looked . Tall , lean , carefully erect , with a heavy black beard , a voluminous mustache and a romantic wealth of dark hair which covered much of his forehead , he looked a born ruler of men , but when he spoke the illusion was shattered : I 'd like to enforce the law , but there is no law . And I ca n't make guesses about it because no one knows what Congress will do . ' When they asked what form the new government would probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a Customs District , so I guess when a customs officer arrives , he 'll be in charge . ' Despite the perspicacity of their questioning , they could elicit no substantial explanations from the general , and they left the meeting both confused and disheartened , so they were not surprised when , upon the arrival of a passenger ship , well over half the local Russians decided to leave Alaska and head back to Siberia . When General Davis saw the huge number departing , he tried ineffectively to entice them to remain , but they 'd had enough of American vacillations and would not listen . Voronov and Luzhin , better able than Davis to estimate the high quality of those who were fleeing Sitka , consoled each other and their wives with the hopeful thought : Those of us who are staying will have extra work to do . . . and extra opportunities to do it , ' and each of the four was determined to be the best possible American citizen . The rest of the Russian story is quickly and sadly told . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American troops , with no clear mission to occupy them or any stern leader to keep them under control , began to run wild , and Voronov , like the other Russians who had stayed behind , became appalled at what was happening . Aleut women who had worked as servants of Russian families transferred their duties to the barracks where the soldiers were billeted , and before the week was out three cases of the ugliest kind of rape were reported . When nothing was done to discipline the men , they went outside the palisade and raped two Tlingit women , whose husbands promptly killed a soldier in retaliation , but he was not one of the rapists . This particular case was resolved by paying the aggrieved husbands twenty-five American dollars each and sending the mother of the dead  | soldier a medal and the news that her son had died bravely in action against the enemy . But now the violence extended to Russian families , who began locking and barring their doors , and two of the men complained bitterly to General Davis , but nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madness will stop . ' It did n't . When a gang of drunken soldiers staggered down to a nearby village and assaulted three women , the Tlingits retaliated with a series of hammering counterblows , which General Davis interpreted as a dangerous insurrection against American rule . Dispatching a gunboat to the offending village , he ordered the place to be chastised ; it was totally destroyed , with heavy loss of Tlingit life . This resulted in the rupture of contact between the occupation force and the Tlingits , which meant that little fresh food made its way into the town . Tempers ran high , and one afternoon as Praskovia returned from a visit with distraught Russian neighbors she saw something which sent her screaming for her husband . When the Voronovs and the Luzhins reached the front door of their cathedral they saw that in the sanctuary , at the iconostasis and throughout the main body of the cathedral everything breakable had been smashed , paint was smeared over the walls , and the pulpit was destroyed . The cathedral was a wreck ; it would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cost the icons hallowed by time could not be replaced . When General Davis was informed of the sacrilege , he shrugged his shoulders and absolved his men of any blame : No doubt some angry Tlingits sneaked in when we were n't looking . ' That night those Russians with administrative or mercantile experience met at the Voronovs ' to discuss what could be done to protect their rights and perhaps their lives , and the consensus was that since General Davis would not assume responsibility for his troops , the only practical thing to do was to appeal to the captain of the first foreign ship putting into Sitka , and Arkady volunteered for the assignment . It was a French ship and the captain was a man well versed in maritime tradition . After listening to Voronov 's recitation of complaints , he fumed : No self-respecting general allows his troops to rape , ' and he marched directly to the castle and made a formal protest . Davis was outraged at this interference , and his assistant , who took note of Voronov 's name in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was any further intervention from him , the cannon up here will know what to do . ' That night , perhaps by accident , perhaps by design , three soldiers went to Voronov 's house while he was known to be absent at a protest meeting , and tried to rape Praskovia , who fought them off vigorously and ran from the house screaming for help . Before she could make good her escape , one of the men grabbed her , dragged her back into the house , and started stripping off her clothes . Neighbors alerted Voronov , who came running home in time to find his wife practically naked in their bedroom , fighting and scratching and gouging at the three men , who were laughing maniacally . When they saw that  | three big Russians were crowding in behind the enraged husband , they beat a planned retreat through a back window , smashing it and as much kitchenware as they could . The other Russians wanted to chase the soldiers , but Voronov would not allow this . Instead , he gathered his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed everything that could be crammed into three bags . In the dark of night he led Praskovia , the Luzhins and their children down to the shore , where he signaled the French ship , in vain . Throwing off his shoes and jacket , he entered the cold water and swam out , shouting as he approached the ship : Captain Rulon , we seek asylum ! ' In the darkness the Voronovs and Luzhins fled Sitka.  | MERICAN MALADMINISTRATION HAD A DEVASTATING EFFECT on Sitka , for its lovely port , which had been the site of more than two hundred visits a year by ships of all nations , saw arrivals drop to nineteen stragglers with little to offer in trade and less money with which to purchase local goods . The population of the town , once among the finest in North America , dropped from more than two thousand to less than three hundred , and with its skilled work force gone to Russia , Sitka saw its Custom House receipts decline from more than sioo , 000 a year in the heyday of Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocking $449.28 . And year by year , the leaders of the Tlingits , watching this debacle , grew bolder , moving out of the fastnesses to which they had retreated under Russian pressure , edging always closer to where the protective palisade had once stood but stood no more . Sitka was in terrible trouble . But the lack of government had an even more destructive impact on the other parts of Alaska , as a chain of incidents will demonstrate . When the consortium of landbound wealthy New Bedford owners learned that their Captain Schransky wanted to christen their new brig the Erebus , they complained that this name , which bespoke underworld and hell , was improper for a whaler owned by God-fearing Christians . He told them sharply : It could bear no name more appropriate , for it will be sailing into the white hell of the arctic ice and snow , ' but when he wanted to paint the  | ship a solid , funereal black , they demurred : Our forefathers sometimes gave their lives defending New England ships against pirates , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearful color . ' When Captain Emil Schransky , six feet four inches tall , with Nordic white hair and heavy beard , insisted that black was the color he wanted ? If it 's to be a hell ship , which it has to be to make money in these waters , let it have a proper hell color ' ? a compromise was reached : it was painted a blue so dark and snarling that from a distance it appeared black , and it was under this fearful color that the Erebus sailed south for dreaded Cape Horn , whose passage would throw her into the broad Pacific . There she would chase the bowhead whale into the Bering Sea , with yearlong expeditions against the fur seals of the Pribilof Islands and the walrus of the Chukchi Sea . Oil taken from the whales would be delivered to Hawaii ; sealskins and walrus tusks would be sold in China , and in between such commercial forays the Erebus would prowl the Pacific , seeking any cargo of opportunity . The ominous dark ship commanded by the formidable captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piracy , but Schransky would be prepared to do so should a likely opportunity safe from detection present itself . He was forty-five years old when he assumed command of the Erebus , a huge man in every way . Born in Germany of Prussian-Russian parentage , he had been thrown out of his turbulent home at the age of eleven and had promptly shipped aboard a world-trader out of Hamburg . Educated in the cruel academy before the mast , he had been at the age of fourteen a bareknuckle brawler , willing to take on and sometimes seeking out cabin boys four and five years older than himself . He was a gouger , a knee-er , an arm-wrencher and a terror who , after he reached his full height at twentytwo , rarely had to use his fists . He was not averse to doing so , but he was just as pleased to lean heavily upon some minor troublemaker and slowly muscle him away from the scene of trouble , saving his punishing fists for real enemies whom he felt he must destroy before they destroyed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred and forty-eight pounds of incarnate fury , all windmill arms and kicking feet and great white beard snapping in the breeze as he came roaring at whoever had in some way infuriated him . At such moments he struck for the kill , and although he had not yet actually slain an American sailor with his fists , two who had shipped with him , one from Maine , one from Maryland , had never recovered from the terrible beatings he gave them . The Maine man died five months later in Lahaina ; the Marylander lived along the Santiago waterfront , his brains addled and his left arm useless . Others , less severely punished , recovered , with arms slightly atwist from the breakings or teeth missing in front . He was a massive man with massive powers and massive enthusiasms , but it was his driving compulsions that made him something more than just another German-Russian sailor with gargantuan appetites . Any ship he stepped upon as captain was his ship , and the financial owners were not welcome aboard ; it would be unthinkable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even part of one . He sailed to make money , and he possessed  | an uncanny faculty for smelling out where it was going to be found . ( He had once made a small fortune in sandalwood which other captains had bypassed . ) And he despised all governing bodies , all restraints and rules . He kept his ships away from their home ports for four and five years because by doing so he could avoid interference from the owners , and as soon as he rounded the Horn , for he avoided the Cape of Good Hope , calling it the route home for milksops , ' he seemed to breathe more easily , taking deep drafts of the salt air of the Pacific , which he sometimes referred to as the Ocean of Freedom , ' for he was able to negotiate from Chile to China without surveillance from local policing agencies . But it was when he penetrated the Aleutians and broke out into the Bering Sea that he began to operate with that abandon which characterized his captaincy . Prior to 1867 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had been a scourge of the Russian masters of the Bering , for he had scorned their attempts to keep him away from the Pribilofs , where he would sweep in unexpectedly to harvest a whole shipload of forbidden sealskins . He also liked to rampage along the Siberian coast north of Petropavlovsk , trading with natives whom the Russians themselves were afraid to approach , or come storming down the western coast of Alaska in chase of bowhead whales , which he seemed able to catch when even the local Eskimos could not . He sometimes spent an entire year in and out of the Bering Sea , harvesting its riches and keeping them semifrozen until he decided to make port at Lahaina or Canton . He kept honest books , and frequently sent huge amounts of money home to his New Bedford owners by way of some returning ship against which he had been competing for years , and when the time came for him to head back for New England , ship captains came to him , begging him to transport their profits , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , ' a Boston captain said with great force , remembering his own contests with Schransky , and he 's destruction to his enemies , but there 's nobody I 'd trust with my cargo or my cash sooner than Captain Emil . ' The Russians before 1867 and the American authorities thereafter did not hold Schransky in this high regard ; to them he was a predator , a scoffer at rules , a thief in the night , a pirate where seals were concerned , and the scourge of the Bering . He seemed ordained by some evil power to prowl the arctic , for he had a sixth sense of when he must flee these unforgiving waters before ice grabbed his vessel , immobilizing it for eight or nine months , and whereas incautious captains were sometimes trapped for the winter , he never was . No better description of him was ever given than the admiring one offered by an Eskimo at Desolation Point as he watched the Erebus slip out of that northern anchorage just before the arrival of the ice pack : Cap'n Schransky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ice whispers to him " I 'm comin ' , " and out he goes . ' In this harsh world he might have been considered an ideal captain , except for three ugly flaws which estranged him from other rough-andready types . He was known as a niggardly captain who kept his crew on meager rations while afloat and then encouraged them to gorge themselves at their own expense when they hit some Hawaiian port . However , his  | sailors put up with his penury because when the time came to split profits with his crew he was generous . His second flaw was that he was contemptuous of the great sea animals on which his prosperity depended . He hunted them callously , sometimes wounding and losing through drowning two whales or walruses for every one he hauled up to his ship . If a mate protested this arrogant waste of animal life , he growled : The seas are endless . There 'll never be a lack of whales or anything else , ' and during the long hunting season of 1873 he put this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erebus sailed through the protective arc of the Aleutians , always a magnificent moment , it was in the Bering Sea only two days when one of the men sighted a pod of nine magnificent bowhead whales , great slow-moving creatures making their way north to the colder seas they loved . In the old days , some hundred thousand of these noble animals had threaded through the northern seas ; now there were less than ten thousand , and Captain Schransky 's abusive manner of hunting them helped explain why . On the starboard beam ! ' he shouted to the mate at the wheel , and when the Erebus swung around to head off the whales , some of them forty feet long and weighing forty tons , the boats were launched and three teams of rowers and harpooners started in pursuit of the placid beasts , who were unaware of the dangers into which they were heading . The hunters of the Erebus had two enormous advantages . The long harpoons they used had in their sharply pointed heads toggles which fitted snugly against the shaft as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprang open to form a T inside the whale 's body so long and strong that the whale could never dislodge it ; and to the other end of the harpoon were fastened big inflated seal bladders which prevented the stricken whale from either diving or swimming rapidly ahead . Once a whale had four or five Erebus harpoons in it , with trailing bladders , it was doomed . But if it managed to swim too far from the ship , Captain Schransky let it go ; he did not pursue endlessly : It 's gone ! Get that next one ! ' So in this attack on the nine whales of the pod , his men killed three , but only one of them was captured for its oil and baleen ; the other two wandered off to perish at a distance . However , that one proved a bonanza , for it rendered many casks of oil and , even better , immensely long strips of baleen , the bonelike substance that enabled the whale to filter out the plankton from the huge amounts of seawater it passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Schransky shouted as his men worked the whale , for he knew that in the fashion shops of Paris and London this whalebone , as it was called , was essential . He could afford to let the two stricken whales escape , for this one catch would bring him more than seven thousand dollars . His hunting of the walrus was equally brutal : three huge beasts shot with rifles , only two and sometimes one retrieved for their ivory . But it was his treatment of the fur-bearing seal that was most ruthless . Evading American patrols with the same clever tricks that had fooled the Russians , he slipped into the Pribilof Islands , that remarkable pair to which most of the world 's  | seals came to have their young . Watching for an opportunity , he landed swiftly on Saint Paul , the northernmost island , where his men armed with clubs rampaged among the defenseless seals , beating them over the head and crushing their skulls . It was not difficult work , because perhaps six hundred thousand seals clustered on this island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the killing could continue as long as the men 's arms could wield their bloodied clubs . In the time of the Russians , when perhaps two million seals had come to the Pribilofs , they appreciated the fact that they had an almost inexhaustible treasury here and policed the harvest so that the immense herd was sure to be replenished , but when avaricious men like Schransky were not restrained , the seals on the Pribilofs were threatened with extinction . However , the real slaughter , the one that all the maritime nations of the world opposed and strove to abolish , was pelagic sealing , the kind that Schransky particularly enjoyed and from which he profited enormously . Pelagic hunting , derived from the Greek word pelagos meaning sea , as in archipelago , consisted of chasing down the seals , most of them gravid females , when they were in the open sea totally defenseless , slaughtering them with ease , and ripping from their wombs the partly formed young whose skins had a special appeal in China . It was an operation that sickened many sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if a captain had no conscience and a ship fast enough to elude Russian or British or American patrol boats , a tidy sum could be made from pelagic campaigns . Captain Schransky was known as the King of the Pelagic Sealers , ' and this year he was determined to sail into Canton with his holds full of choice pelts , so he kept two lookouts forward to spot , if possible , the areas in which the oncoming seals might show , and when one of the men shouted Seals , five on the port bow ! ' he sped the Erebus toward that spot , and when the boats were launched , the men rowed in among the defenseless seals and started stabbing and beating them to death . Since seals could not stay submerged indefinitely , and since a boat with four strong rowers could overtake them when they had to surface for air , the slaughter was concentrated and endless . Especially vulnerable were the pregnant females ; their mortality was above ninety percent in any area that the boats reached , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But again , a shocking eighty percent of all seals killed were not retrieved ; they sank fruitlessly to the bottom of the sea as the Erebus signaled for its boats to return so that it could proceed on its way to China and the riches that awaited it there . Captain Schransky 's third flaw was the most serious , for its evil consequences would survive long after he departed these waters . Abstemious himself and allowing no drunkenness aboard his ship , he early discovered the enormous profits that could be made by filling his hold in New Bedford with casks of rum and molasses and pushing them on natives who had little or no experience with alcohol . The consequences in the lands bordering the Bering were disastrous ; natives developed such a craving for rum or the hoochinoo rotgut they distilled from the molasses  --  named after the local tribe that first made the stuff and quickly abbreviated to hooch  --  that some-  | times entire villages were wiped out because men , women and children destroyed themselves with incessant drinking . It seemed that everyone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the Russians had outlawed it early and policed their shores vigorously ; missionaries preached against it ; and New England moralists deplored the sinful transactions in which these crews were involved . But captains like Schransky found the great wealth to be derived from the trade irresistible , so gradually , village by village , in both Siberia and Alaska , the natives were corrupted . With the change of national ownership in 1867 , the tough Russian captains who had maintained some kind of order in the Bering Sea turned over the responsibility to poorly trained American seamen in the Treasury 's revenue cutter service , whose cumbersome ships , the Rush and Corwin , proved incapable of disciplining the Erebus . So for nearly eight years , 1867 ? 75 , Captain Schransky enjoyed unchallenged mastery of the northern waters , slaughtering seals as he wished and purveying hooch wherever he anchored . He had become dictator of the oceans , obedient only to his own law . This year , 1875 , he was only forty-eight , and it was while laying to off Cape Krigugon on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he perceived it : Three more returns to New Bedford , that could take maybe eighteen years . I 'll be sixty-six . One grand final sweep . . . all the seals in the Pribilofs . . . all the rum our ship can hold . Then buy a home by the sea . . . maybe New Bedford , maybe near Hamburg . In his speculations it never occurred to him that a man might be coming into these waters almost as tall as he , almost as brave , almost as good a fighter and , because of his exceptional personal history , many times more determined . If in the whaling season of 1875 , Captain Schransky had chanced to put in to the little settlement at Desolation Point on the Alaskan side of the Chukchi Sea , he would probably have prevented a murder , but since the summer was waning fast , he required none of the goods that Desolation could provide . Also , his inner compass  --  thermometer  --  ship's-wheel warned him that the freeze was going to strike rather sooner than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , keeping well out into the Chukchi , he hurried south . As he disappeared , taking with him the last group of white men the region would see for nearly a year , the vengeful Eskimo Agulaak understandably felt that perhaps the time for retaliation had come , and he began to lay plans for the undoing of the missionary Father Fyodor , the Orthodox priest who had come north from the Yukon to open a mission here in 1868 . The priest was appreciated by the Desolation Eskimos , for he was a generous , understanding soul who lived in the Eskimo manner , using a timber-roofed underground dwelling until he and his wife and their young son had collected enough driftwood to build themselves a proper cabin ; proper meaning a lean-to , with a stout wall facing the frozen sea and the great blasts of cold air coming out of Siberia , a crude fireplace with an  | improvised chimney , and a whole southern wall more or less open to the elements but protected in part by three caribou hides that served as flaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when one wanted to enter . The cabin was warm , well insulated with packets of moss stu . ' . ed in cracks , and a lively center for the informal meetings which occupied so much of Eskimo life . Here the young people of the village gathered for their informal courtships , and along its warm walls sat the older Eskimos , listening as one of their members told of heroic adventures in the olden days . It was a satisfying life , and when Father Fyodor 's wife produced another child , a girl this time , the little cabin echoed with singing , for the priest and his wife had made themselves a central part of the community . If the priest , forty-seven years old and one who never looked at another man 's wife , had become the target of the would-be murderer Agulaak , what evil force had begun to prowl the Point , bringing Agulaak under its malevolent spell ? It would have been fruitless to argue with the tormented Eskimo that no force was assailing him , for evidence to the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunts , far out on the ice , he 'd had a beast under his magic control , only to lose him at the critical moment : Something spoke to the walrus , warning him that I was there . I did n't hear the voice but I know it was whispering . Last spring , when the caribou came down from the northeast , as they so often did when making their rounds of the north , he had trailed the herd as always , had selected his spot where the bigger animals must pass , and had watched in despair as one after another of the sleek beasts came almost within range of his spears , then veered away . On a later hunt , when he took the rifle that he had acquired from the Erebus two years before when it came to trade , almost the same thing happened : the caribou appeared on the horizon in great quantity , came right down the slough they always followed , then swung away when someone or something warned them that Agulaak was waiting . From a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deduce that someone at Desolation Point was casting a spell upon him , and since the area had at this time no shaman whose incantations would solve the mystery , Agulaak was left to stew in his own twisted imaginings , and the more he brooded about the magic that had been directed against him , the more clear it became to him that this intruder , Father Fyodor , must be the man responsible . He was , first of all , a Russian , which of itself awarded him unusual powers . Then he was a priest , which involved incantations , the burning of incense and behavior of the most suspicious kind . Most condemnatory was the fact that the man had an Athapascan wife , for it looked to Agulaak as if the priest had married her for the specific purpose of insinuating her into the Eskimo community at Desolation for its ultimate destruction . As a boy he had heard endless tales of how the Athapascans connived to cast spells upon Eskimos , and these recent events involving himself proved that some malefic force was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this point , when he had convinced himself that it was Father Fyodor 's Indian wife , who had taken the Biblical name Esther , who was working against him , a curious transferral of guilt took place , for as a self-respecting  | Inupiat Eskimo trained in the rigors of hunting and warfare , he could not in decency direct his ire against a woman , regardless of how malevolent her spells , but he certainly could strike out at the misguided man who had brought her into the community . So his anger now focused on the priest , and the more he pondered the wrongs done him by this white man , the more embittered he became . Agulaak decided that since Father Fyodor had to be the activating cause of everything bad that had befallen him , he must be destroyed . And once he had reached this verdict , he never looked back : his only problem was when and how . He was a canny fellow , rather superior in his hunting skills when evil forces were not working against him , and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceive the other villagers as to who had done the killing , for it was essential that everyone know that he , Agulaak , had cleansed the village of its evil agency , it was imperative that he find a time and a situation appropriate for the deed and one in which the priest 's unquestioned powers would be at a disadvantage or perhaps totally neutralized . This required artful plotting . Agulaak 's twisted mind suggested a variety of actions which he dismissed , and then a maneuver which seemed positively brilliant when he weighed it . What he did was get his gun , load it heavily , march to the hut in which the mission church met on Wednesday evenings , and wait until Father Fyodor appeared with six parishioners at the close of service . Moving to within eight feet of his enemy , he suddenly produced his gun , took careful aim , and in the presence of six witnesses , shot the priest through the chest . Death was immediate , as Agulaak saw , for he remained at the murder site grinning vacuously at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these lawless years manifested itself , for there was no governmental agency in the entire district that had author . ity to move into Desolation Point , apprehend the murderer , and carry him off to trial in an established court before a legally impaneled jury . The people living in or near Desolation did not feel qualified even to arrest Agulaak , let alone try him , and as for placing him in jail to prevent further outrage , there was none within almost a thousand miles . So this madman was allowed to roam free , and citizens took precautions to prevent his attacking them while they prayed that with the coming of spring thaw next year , some American ship might put in to Desolation with an officer aboard to exercise the rudiments of governmental authority . This inability to handle an ordinary civic problem placed an unusually heavy burden on Father Fyodor 's widow , for she was now an Athapascan intruder in the midst of an Inupiat Eskimo community , with two children , a boy , Dmitri , of nine and a girl , Lena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she continued to offer her hut for informal religious services , but in doing so , she intensified Agulaak 's suspicions and animosity . Neighbors warned her of threats the madman was making against her as he wandered aimlessly about the village , but there was nothing she could do to protect herself against him . Her son , however , had access to his dead father 's Russian rifle , and he  | was old enough to appreciate the danger Agulaak presented , so one wintry day when there was a wisp of gray dawn for about an hour at noon , and he saw Agulaak approaching his mother 's hut , Dmitri suddenly jumped in front of him , gun pointed at his chest , and cried : Agulaak ! If you ever come one step closer to my mother , I 'll shoot ! ' The demented fellow , convinced that the dead spirit of the priest had come back to earth in the person of his son , was terrified of the lad , drew back from the Russian gun , and fled . He was seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes in the wind-shadow of this hut or that . On the occasions when he spoke with villagers , he warned them about the ghost of Father Fyodor who had returned to seek vengeance , but he seemed unable to comprehend that if this were true , it would be himself , Agulaak , who would be in danger . He had never really understood that he had murdered the priest , but he continued to be terrified of little Dmitri , who rarely appeared in public without his gun . In such sad , broken ways the remote villages of Alaska stumbled on without a government . Like some dark raven scavenging the northern seas , looking for the latest disaster upon which to feed , the Erebus coasted along the shore of Siberia , seeking some Chukchi village whose citizens it could defraud of their pelts trapped during the last winter , but the Siberians had become accustomed to Captain Schransky 's harsh ways and remained indoors , hiding their furry riches until his sinister ship departed , with him standing , white-crowned and bareheaded , peering for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he coasted north to that cape which brought Asia closest to America , and there he headed east for the big , well-populated St. Lawrence Island , whose northern three villages had provided him with good pelts in the past . But he approached the towns with mixed feelings , because in recent years men of the villages had become aware of the value of their furs and demanded high prices in barter goods like cloth for their wives and saws and hammers for themselves . Determined to put a stop to this sophisticated trading , Captain Schransky had decided long before sighting St. Lawrence that this time he would use less expensive tactics , so when he anchored off Kookoolik , principal settlement on the northern rim , he took ashore not the customary items of hardware and cloth , but a keg of rum , and with it he taught the people of St. Lawrence how barters were going to be conducted in the future . Dispensing the rum liberally , he ingratiated himself with the natives , until there was nightly dancing and singing , then men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sailors and the village maidens while the girls ' customary suitors lay drunk in corners . However , the salient outcome of the induced debauchery was that the islanders , always hungry for the alcohol , brought forth their carefully hoarded stores of sealskins and ivory tusks , which they traded for abominably low prices as calculated in rum .  | At the end of three weeks , when Schransky had pretty well denuded Kookoolik of its treasures , he brought ashore two barrels of dark West Indian molasses , but after tasting the bittersweet fluid the islanders said that they did not care for it and wanted rum instead . Now Schransky initiated them into a new pleasure that would guarantee the destruction of their village : he taught two of the older men how to transform molasses into rum , and when the first heady distillate appeared , the islanders were lost . In the season when they should have been at sea catching seals and storing both the pelts and the meat , they were reveling on the beach , and in the more arduous months when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tusks and again for the meat which , when dried , would sustain them through the coming winter , they were drunk and happy and heedless of the passing season . There had never been so much unmindful happiness in Kookoolik as there was that long summer when they learned how to drink rum and then make more from the treasured kegs of molasses . Of course , when the Erebus sailed , all the valuables of the village went with it , and one old woman who did not like the taste of rum was already asking , vainly : When are you men going to go out and catch the food we 'll need for winter ? ' No one paid any attention to the problem she raised or to its solution . When the Erebus moved along to the village of Sevak at the eastern end of the island , the sailors came upon a people who loved to dance , so when they were introduced to rum and the fascinating secret of how to manufacture it , the village echoed with the sound of Eskimos singing old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most curious dance forms : men and women stood with their feet solidly planted on the floor , as if set in frozen lava , while their knees , middle , torso , arms and head twisted rhythmically in contortions that no ordinary human would imagine . If to the rest of the world the word dance meant to leap or skip about in an artistic manner , to these Eskimos it meant something quite the opposite : keep your feet firm but move your body artistically . At first the sailors found the Sevak dancing monotonous , but after they had watched it for several nights , some of the more adventurous took to the floor , listened to the beat of the chanting , and stood with their feet firmly planted while they contorted their bodies in ways never tried before as some old women of lively spirit danced beside them . Toward dawn this glorious summer , the dancers fell drunk while walruses and whales passed the island unmolested . A feature of all the celebrations on St. Lawrence that surreal summer was the tall austere figure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debauchery , taking a perverse delight in following the steps of the islanders ' degradation : now that girl is going off with Adams ; now that old woman is beginning to stagger ; now the man with the missing teeth is about to collapse . Like an uninvolved Norse god , he watched the frolicking of his earthlings and found sardonic amusement in their destruction of themselves . At the third village , Chibukak at the extreme western end of the island , he used a minimum of rum to acquire a maximum of pelts , for in the waters  | off this point seal and walrus were easiest to capture , and the villagers had accumulated a substantial store of furs that they would normally have traded with adventurous ships setting out from Siberia , but since Russians had been forbidden over the past century from taking alcohol to any part of Alaska , they could not bring to Chibukak the exciting goods that Captain Schransky offered . Here the devastation was even more tragic than at the first two villages , for the riches of the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich store of food with a few weeks ' work in late July and August , but this year the precious days were spent in revelry and song and concupiscence . Here no sage older woman warned the men of the dangerous track they were following , for the women , too , stayed drunk from one festivity to the next , and when the Erebus finally sailed , the grinning people of Chibukak lined the shore to bid their good friends farewell , as pelts of seals and walruses accompanied the ship southward . When the dark Erebus was about to leave St. Lawrence , Captain Schransky spotted on the southern coast the tiny village of Powooiliak , and he judged that because of its isolation , it might never have been visited by Siberian traders . If so , it would probably have an accumulated store of ivory , and he was about to put in to investigate when a sudden shift in the weather warned him that ice was not far off , so he surrendered the ivory of Powooiliak and headed south toward the southern limits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early autumn , he found himself drifting in the midst of a large movement of seals that had left the Pribilofs and were heading for the warmer waters in which they would winter , and although he knew that taking seals under such circumstances was forbidden , the temptation to fill his hold to the limit with pelts for trade in Canton was too great to resist , and he ordered his men to attack the seals , who in midocean were especially vulnerable . This was not true pelagic sealing , for it was occurring in autumn when the females were not pregnant , but it was outlawed by all nations bordering on the seal routes ; however , since it was unlikely that any patrol ships would be in these waters at this time , the cruel harvest continued . There was , however , by accident and not design , a slow , inadequate ship , the revenue cutter Rush , limping home from a mishap which had deterred it in the Pribilofs , and when its captain saw the Erebus slaughtering the seals , he fired a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but even as he did so he realized that beyond warning the poacher , there was not much he could do . When the Rush came slowly up to the sealing area , the Erebus insolently eased off at about the same speed , and for most of one morning the charade continued . Finally , with all sails spread , the Erebus put on a burst of speed , maneuvered insultingly close to the impotent Rush , and hurried toward China with its riches . It was the dominator of these seas and it would comport itself as Captain Schransky determined , not some pusillanimous captain of an American patrol boat .  | During the last days of spring 1877 the Tlingit Indians , who clustered outside the palisade protecting Sitka , kept close watch upon happenings in the capital , and saw with amazement that the steamer California had anchored in the sound for the purpose of removing the entire army garrison , whose troops boarded the ship on the fourteenth of June and left Alaska forever on the morning of the fifteenth . Who will take their place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one knew , and it was as a result of this confusion that three thoughtful Tlingits , who would have been termed warriors in the old days , sequestered a canoe where the Americans in command , whoever they might be , could not observe it , and on a silvery night , when the sun disappeared only for a few hours , left Sitka , paddled due north to that maze of enchanting narrows which led to Peril Strait , and from there into noble Chatham Strait , which bisected this part of Alaska . At the northern tip of Admiralty Island , which lay to the east , they turned south through the lovely passage on which the future capital of Juneau would one day sit , and then , with a left turn toward Canada , they entered one of the choice small waterways of the region , Taku Inlet , from whose left bank , hidden amidst glaciers , debouched a beautiful mountain stream , Pleiades River , and there at the mouth of the river stood a cabin erected many years ago . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come seeking counsel . ' Halloo , Big-ears ! ' they shouted as they approached the cabin , for they knew from experience that he was prone to shoot at intruders . Ivan Bigears , we come from Sitka ! ' And when the calls were repeated , a tall , bigboned Tlingit in his sixties , with white hair and erect posture , came to the cabin door , stared toward the riverbank , and saw men he had known forty years earlier when they fought the Russians in repeated battles that the Tlingits usually lost . Striding down to the bank , he greeted his onetime companions , then asked them bluntly : What brings you here ? ' and his nostrils widened when he heard their reply : The Americans in Sitka . They grow weaker every day . The time 's at hand , Big-ears .. ' Come ! Let us talk , ' and as they told him of the chaos in which the American occupation foundered , he listened grim-lipped , and by the time their mournful litany was finished , his mind was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one of the messengers warned : I 've thought so , too . We can surely defeat the fools who hold the hill now , but I 'm worried about the rush of new soldiers who might be brought in , ' and Big-ears had a sage response : Not a big battle with war cries . Slow pressure , day by day , until their spirit is broken and we regain our ancient rights . ' Like a Kot-le-an of a later day , he spoke as a wise man of his tribe , one who had spent his life brooding upon the unjust way in which his people had lost their glorious land at Sitka , and this report of degenerating American control inflamed his ardor but did not confuse his generalship : A big battle would produce big news , and ships filled with soldiers would speed  | up from the south , but each day more pressure , more advantage to us , and there will be no alarms . ' He was fortified in this strategy by an act of folly committed by the incompetent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tlingit living in a village on Douglas Island came hurrying up Taku Inlet in his canoe , with distressing news : Trouble in our village . Four white miners tried to abuse our women . We fought them . Now the warship is coming from Sitka to punish us , because they claim we attacked them . ' The word in Tlingit for warship carried no implications of size : the approaching vessel could be either a huge man-of-war or a corvette , but the impression created was one of military power , and Ivan Big-ears , who had been forced to take a Russian first name in 1861 when he knew the tsar 's power to be already fading , wanted to see for himself what American power was in the waning days of its control , so he and his visitors set forth in two canoes , moving quietly along the shore so as not to be seen by the approaching warship . Accompanied by the messenger from the village about to be attacked , they slipped out of Taku Inlet , hid in the mouth of the strait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a small American ship steamed into the quiet waters , located the wrong village , and began shelling it so ineffectively that at the first salvo , which missed completely , the occupants fled to the surrounding forest , from where they watched as the fourth salvo finally struck their empty shacks , battering them to pieces . Triumphantly the ship patrolled the shoreline for about an hour , with no soldier brave enough to go ashore to assess the damage , and then , with a final salvo that merely ricocheted among the trees , it retired to report another American victory . When it was safely gone , Big-ears and his companions , including the messenger from the village that should have been the target , paddled across the strait to the wreckage and explained to the bewildered villagers as they came out of the forest : They fired on the wrong place , ' and from that settlement as well as the other , Big-ears enlisted Tlingit warriors , who agreed that the time had come to move against the incompetents who occupied Sitka , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infiltrating the capital . Had Arkady Voronov still been in residence at Sitka , he would have known of the increased Tlingit pressure within a week , but the Americans now in charge of the place drifted amiably on , unaware that they were surrounded by an enemy that grew stronger each passing month . Now came the darkest period of the American occupancy of Alaska . The presence of the army , inadequate though it had been and preposterous as its commander , General Davis , had seemed to the citizens who were ruled by him , had nevertheless provided a semblance of government , and of a hundred typical acts it performed in the post-1867 period , some ninety were either constructive or neutral , and now to have even this inadequate symbol of government removed was to invite disaster .  | First the outward signs of control disappeared from the streets of Sitka . Police , even the few who were present , exercised no authority . Port facilities deteriorated so badly that the few ships which did put in left quickly , with vows never to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenues declined month by month . Smuggling became endemic , and rum , whiskey and molasses flowed unimpeded into the settlements . Miners and fishermen did as they wished , evaded such laws as there were , and decimated the supplies that used to flourish near Sitka . Foreign ships trespassed on seal rookeries that were supposed to be protected , and threatened to exterminate walruses , whales and the frolicsome sea otters who had begun to make a comeback . But the most ominous development surfaced when Tlingits like Ivan Big-ears started drifting in from outlying districts , joining up with local dissidents and indulging in pressure behavior that terrified the white citizens . There were no murders , no burnings , simply the reappearance of Tlingits into areas from which they had been expelled by Baranov . And to the average white man unfamiliar with the old days , the sudden appearance of a tall , powerful Indian like Ivan Big-ears could be both terrifying and a premonition that dreadful things were about to happen . What the Tlingits wanted was well represented by Big-ears . We must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live where we wish according to our ancient ways , to have the new government respect our tribal laws and customs . ' Since there was no resident authority to which he could make these reasonable demands , he was forced to further them by insinuating his people into the daily life of Sitka , and when he did this , the locals felt that they must resist . There was a family from Oregon living in Sitka at this time , the Caldwells  --  husband , wife , son Tom aged seventeen , daughter Betts aged fifteen  --  and they had come north through Seattle with the understanding that Mr. Caldwell could open a lawyer 's office in the capital , and he came well prepared for such service to the frontier community . He brought with him three crates of lawbooks , especially those dealing with territories and new states , both of which he assumed Alaska would become in the near future . He was most disappointed to learn that law and courts were not major concerns of the little capital , and as for an office from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he could acquire land on which to build one , nor were there any spare buildings that one could buy with assurance of obtaining a title . What can I do ? ' he asked in growing frustration , and a man who had been living in Sitka since the Russian days said : I think your wife might be able to get a job teaching at the new school , ' and in disgust Mr. Caldwell said : If there 's a job open , I 'll take it , ' but then his problem became : But where will I find a place to live ? ' and the same adviser told him : There 's a big house down the street . Used to be lived in by a Russian family . Great people , went back to Siberia . ' Mr. Caldwell said : I do n't think we want to buy a big house , ' and the man said : Good , because it ai n't for sale . But a very nice Aleut woman married to a Tlingit fisherman runs it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Caldwells received the good news that they could rent rooms at the old Russian house , as it was still called , and the bad news that whereas there was a teaching job at the informal school , only a woman would be considered . As a result , Mrs. Caldwell became a teacher in a school that had no visible means of support , for it had no tax base , there being no agency to assess taxes , whereas her husband , with the ingenuity of a man who had wanted to leave settled Oregon for the adventure of the Alaskan frontier , devised five or six imaginative ways to earn a little money other than by being a lawyer . He did paperwork for citizens who had to communicate with offices back in the States . He served as agent for the few ships that steamed into port . He helped at the coaling station where those same ships acquired fuel for their trips north . And he was not above working as either a day laborer or a handyman . Neither he nor his wife had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plus some money picked up by their son , who was just as adaptable as his father , the Caldwells survived , and when the father received small commissions from miners and fishermen , they came close to prospering . But always Caldwell listened to rumors and actual reports as to when Sitka was going to have a court system , and Alaska a formal system of government in which a lawyer could make a decent living : When that time comes , Nora , there 's not going to be anyone in Alaska who 'll know more than I will about the ins and outs of commerce and customs and the importation of goods and the management of mining and fishing . Surely , things will have to be straightened out , and then the Carl Caldwells come into their own . ' Of course , during the dismal years of 1877 and ' 78 , his hopes of action from Washington were disappointed , and instead of order coming to Alaska , grievous disorder came . Caldwell first became aware of impending danger when his wife came home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our children who plays with Aleuts said that a famous Tlingit warrior who fought the Russians many times .. What about him ? ' He 's come back to Sitka . ' What does that signify ? ' I asked one of the other teachers , and all she said was that her brother had seen him at the edge of town . Name Ivan Big-ears , a famous warrior ... like the child said . ' Never heard the name , ' Mr. Caldwell said , but during the next days when he made quiet inquiries he learned that Ivan Big-ears , if it was indeed he , had fought against the Russians and had fled to voluntary exile somewhere to the east . If he 's come back , ' one older white man said , it can only mean trouble . I was here when he battled the Russians . Never won but also never accepted defeat . ' Caldwell asked what this Big-ears looked like , and another man said with obvious fear in his voice : I think I saw him the other day . Tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dark even for a Tlingit . ' About this time Caldwell noticed that the Aleut-Tlingit couple who ran the Russian house in which the four Caldwells stayed became aloof , unwill-  | ing to talk with their boarders , and when Carl tried to discover why the change had occurred , he discovered , through the kind of detective work that lawyers enjoy doing , that the owners of the house were entertaining secret guests at night , and when the three older Caldwells established a watch , the son saw four Tlingits slipping into the back of the house . Was one of them tall , older , white hair ? ' Carl asked in a whisper , and his son said : Yes . He 's in there now . ' Carl swore the boy to secrecy : Important things may be involved . Speak to no one . ' But he himself stayed up all night , keeping watch on the rear door , and toward dawn he was rewarded by a clear glimpse of a tall , handsome Tlingit who must have been Ivan Big-ears . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had joined the detective work , accumulated fairly solid evidence that the Aleut-Tlingit community was engaged in some kind of conspiracy which involved Ivan Big-ears and at least several scores of Indians from other settlements across the water . And once this distressing theory was formulated , this clever family amassed a disturbing amount of substantiating data  --  more secret meetings in the back of the house , Tlingit men who could not be identified as locals lurking along the edges of the town , a gun stolen here and there , a subtle arrogance among the natives which had not existed before . Carl Caldwell said : With the army gone and no agency to replace it , the Tlingits have grown bold . Something bad is bound to happen . ' His wife said : If the rumors I hear are true , enough Tlingits have filtered in to wipe us out . ' Tom said : The men at the dock told me more guns had been stolen , ' and Betts reported that Tlingit children had begun to push white children off the footpaths . Caldwell exploded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why ca n't the officials ? ' But who were the officials ? When it was agreed that Caldwell must go to them and present his suspicions about a possible uprising of the Indians , it became obvious that there was really no one in authority with whom he could conduct a meaningful conversation . The little customs boat which had shelled the wrong village near Taku Inlet still lay at anchor in the harbor , but its captain , having made a fool of himself at that bombardment , showed no disposition to do so again in response to the crazy suspicions of a man who had been in town less than a year . So when Caldwell broached the subject , the captain stopped him with a rambling discourse : Were you here when General Davis was in command ? No ? Well , folks hereabout thought poorly of him , but when he left here he was assigned to the Oregon-California boundary where the Modoc Indians was actin ' up . Real bad Indian named Captain Jack come out under a white flag and shot the American general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and with great courage captured Captain Jack and saw him hanged . At the end of the Modoc affair , he gained a commendation and spent his remainin ' time in service chasin ' Indians , who he despised . A real hero . ' Caldwell had not come to talk about a general he had never known , but  | when he tried to bring the conversation to a serious discussion of the impending crisis whose outlines he saw so clearly , he accomplished nothing and left the customs boat in despair . They did n't even listen , ' he told his wife , and that night when Ivan Big-ears and five of his lieutenants crowded into the Russian house , Caldwell managed to overhear their agitated conversation , but since it was conducted in Tlingit , he understood nothing except the spirit of the words , but the animosity in the voices could not be masked . However , at several points in the Indian debate about timing and tactics , men did use individual English words or phrases , and from them Caldwell obtained such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , early morning , three men running and other words pertaining to military action , and toward dawn , when he had heard enough , he convened his own meeting to discuss the steps that would have to be taken : If the United States ca n't protect us , and if there is n't any government here to take action , the only practical thing we can do is throw ourselves on the mercy of the Canadians , ' and this strategy his three listeners agreed to . But how to reach the Canadians with a plea for help ? Tom had kept a map of the approaches to Alaska which the steamship company bringing them to Sitka had provided , and from its imperfect data he calculated that the distance to Prince Rupert Island and the seaport of that name would be about two hundred and eighty miles : Three men in a good canoe could get there in four days , if they 're good men . ' Would you be one of them ? ' Caldwell senior asked , and Tom said : You bet . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to go south to fetch aid , can you and Betts protect yourselves till we get back ? ' Before she could reply , he pointed toward the back of the house : With them scheming on the other side ? ' We 'd go to the church , ' she said calmly , find safety with the other women and their men , ' and when she looked at her daughter , Betts nodded . Tom 's suggestion that to paddle nearly one hundred miles , the first half through open seas , would require at least three men was so sensible that his father had to agree : We must find a third man before we can set out , ' and in the next days as he scanned the community , peering into white faces to calculate who might have courage , he settled upon a choice between two men who impressed him with their general bearing . One was an older fellow named Tompkins , who like Caldwell worked at various jobs ; the other , a much younger man named Alcott , whom Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His inclination was to approach Tompkins first , and this was a good hunch , because when he did , Tompkins surprised him by saying immediately : Of course there 's bound to be trouble , ' but he shied off when Carl suggested begging for help in Canada : Too far . They 'd never help Americans , anyway . They want Alaska for theirself , ' and it looked as if the Caldwells would not be able to enlist his help . However , that very afternoon a group of Indians who had come into town from the north began acting in a rowdy manner in the center of Sitka , and  | so terrified newcomer whites that a general panic ensued , but the quick disciplining of the rambunctious Tlingits by other Indians associated with Big-ears quieted the affair , so that the general uprising which many now feared did not occur . That was enough for Tompkins , who came to report his decision : We 've got to get to Canada for help . ' In the meantime , however , Caldwell had approached Alcott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulated his own strong evidence : Things got to blow to hell pretty soon . Canada ? Had n't thought of it , but there 's no help around here , ' and he insisted upon joining the expedition , making four . It was not a canoe in the sense that a frail birchbark affair in Pennsylvania would be called by that name ; the one that Tompkins provided was a sturdy , spruce-ribbed , solidly built craft which had every chance of surviving in the ocean part of the journey . It could , in calmer water , provide space for eight paddles and ample room for four , regardless of the waves , and when the men met to inspect the craft , it was young Tom who voiced their judgment : We can get to Canada in it , ' and the adventure was under way . The white men used as much craftiness in slipping out of Sitka as Ivan Big-ears had used when slipping in . Waiting for one of those gray , misty dawns when all things in Sitka , even the brooding mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they took off undetected by the Tlingits , sped out of Sitka Sound , ducked in and out through the protecting islands for the first leg of the journey , then headed south for the first perilous reach of open ocean , where they found the waves frighteningly big but not overwhelming . It was a heroic trip , with muscles strained and stomachs taut , but in time they reached that wilderness of islands which provided an inside passage nearly to Prince Rupert . There was a final dash across unprotected ocean , but at last the weary messengers paddled into the safety of the Canadian harbor . In one of the fortunate accidents which help determine history , equal in results to times with careful planning , when the four men from Sitka reached Prince Rupert they found in its harbor the Canadian warship Osprey , a vessel of no great size stationed there to protect Hudson 's Bay Company outposts on the coast , and because Prince Rupert was at the western edge of Canada , its officials were in the habit of making up their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the Indians are about to overrun Sitka ? Why does n't your own government take steps ? You say there is no government ? Unbelievable . ' So the first task of the Sitka men was to convince the Canadians that things were as bad in Alaska as they said , but Carl Caldwell was a persuasive man , and within an hour he satisfied the men of the Osprey that without their help , real tragedy threatened in Sitka , and by nightfall the little Canadian warship was steaming north to protect American interests . Was Sitka in the closing days of February 1879 in the perilous situation that the Caldwell party reported ? Probably not . Responsible Tlingit leaders like Ivan Big-ears had no plans to murder the white population in their beds ; what they sought was fair ownership of the land , assured supplies of food  | and hardware and cloth , some kind of sensible control of salmon fishing , and a just participation in the lawmaking procedure . They were willing to do battle with whatever military force might oppose them , and men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beliefs , but in these delicate days when the Osprey hurried north to put down a bloody revolution , the attacking Tlingits had no plans for one . Indeed , any kind of responsible government in Sitka would have been able to parley with the Tlingits , resolve their concerns amicably , and avoid serious trouble , but of course there was no government . The Osprey steamed into Sitka Sound on i March 1879 , and its bold show of power , with guns at the ready and uniformed troops marching ashore , quieted even the remote possibility of Tlingit revolt . No lives were lost . The Caldwell women did not have to seek sanctuary in the old Russian church . And the Tlingits who had been meeting in the rear of their house gradually dissipated , with outside warriors like Ivan Big-Ears returning sadly to their isolated homes , aware that justice would be denied them for decades to come . In this manner the legend was born that a Canadian warship had saved Alaska for the United States when no American agency was brave enough to assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Osprey , helped launch the myth : It 's been a dark day in American history . Even this General Davis they laugh at would n't have allowed this shameful thing to happen . ' In April , when an American warship finally arrived , the Canadians courteously retired , taking with them the gratitude of the community . Later , an able , quiet-spoken Commander Beardslee reached Sitka in the Jamestown , whose afterdeck became the capital of Alaska , with Beardslee issuing orders regarding things about which he knew little . Fortunately , he had the advice of Lawyer Caldwell , and many of the good rules the latter had sought were promulgated by Beardslee , who installed Caldwell as a kind of judge in an informal court . It was not a good system of government and both men knew it , but it was the only one available , so for two years these well-intentioned men more or less ran Alaska , but neither believed such a system could prevail . It 's a disgrace , ' Beardslee growled one day when something had gone wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take themselves too seriously , because at this time Sitka contained only one hundred and sixty whites and Creoles , plus about a hundred Indians , and all of Alaska had only thirtythree thousand people , counting everybody . The implacable course of history and the nature of the human beings who enable it to evolve make it impossible for a condition like that of Alaska in the post-1867 period to continue . Either revolution churns the chaos , as the uprising of the Tlingits nearly did , or some alien power steps in , as Canada might have done , or some giant like Abraham Lincoln or Otto von Bismarck steps forward to take command and reshape things sensibly . Alaska in these crucial times was blessed in having two giants of dissimilar charac-  | ter come to its shores and assume responsibility ; between them they brought a semblance of government to an abandoned region . The first of these men was an irascible dark-browed mariner with the good Irish name Michael Healy , who had a foul vocabulary , an insatiable craving for strong drink and an inherited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two with a temper he could not control , he was hardly the kind of man one would expect to evolve into a respected leader , but that 's what happened in the frozen seas of the north . Born in Georgia , he hated the cold , but of all the American seafarers of his time , he better than any other mastered the arctic seas and tamed the wild coasts of Siberia and Alaska . He had been a junior officer during that humiliating experience in 1876 when the inadequate revenue cutter Rush tried to discipline the semipiratical Erebus for illegal sealing , and he would never forget the oath he took as he watched the insolent white-haired captain of that ship glide away with an insulting grin . ' I ' 11 get that bastard , ' Healy swore , and the rest of what he vowed to do with the German when he caught him would be unprintable . He was so infuriated that an American vessel , a warship really , had been demeaned that he retired to his quarters , sneaked out his smuggled liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sobered a bit , he promised the tame parrot he kept with him on his cruises : By the saints , we 'll get that cocksure bastard . Somewhere when the ice is thick and he ca n't run from us . . . ' and his dark right fist punched at air . On duty in the little revenue cutters , Lieutenant Healy , Commander Healy and , finally , Captain Healy gained increasing praise from his superiors and repeated humiliation from the Erebus , but he did not lose these f near-battles through incompetent seamanship or any lack of courage , but only because he sailed an inferior ship . Once while in charge of the Corwin , the better of the two revenue cutters , he caught the Erebus engaged in illegal sealing at the Pribilofs : We have him , men ! Hard to ! ' But almost as if aided by divine winds , the big indigo ship unfurled its square sails and ran right away from the cutter . Pursuit was impossible , and the government ship had to limp off to other duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleek vessel , laughed once more at Healy 's frustration . If the profane and hard-drinking Irishman failed repeatedly in his attempts to discipline the dark rogue ship , what did he accomplish on his tours of duty through the northern oceans ? To find the answer , one must accompany him on one trip made in the late 187os . In early spring , in command of the Corwin , he sailed out of San Francisco with a full crew and considerable implied powers , for he was the major American representative in Alaska and the surrounding waters . Putting in to Sitka on the way north , he listened to local complaints and summoned to his afterdeck scoundrelly men accused of selling hooch to Indians ; these he fined , making careful duplicate copies of receipts showing his handling of the money involved . From there , following the reverse of the historical course which had brought Aleksandr Baranov to immortality at Sitka , he crossed an arm of the Pacific that carried him to Kodiak , where a deputation of old-time  | Aleuts and newcomer Americans awaited his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups . Moving ashore this time , but taking a ship 's scribe with him , he listened patiently as the contesting parties made their presentations , then surprised everyone by announcing : Let 's think about this carefully , ' and he invited the entire party back onto the ship , where a feast from the Corwin 's supplies was provided . There was no public drinking , of course , since a major responsibility of the Corwin or any other cutter was to end the illegal sale of alcohol to natives , but he did slip into his cabin for a healthy nip from the bottles he carried hidden there . At the conclusion of the feast he took the leaders of the two factions , some seven men , to the railings of the cutter and said : You Aleuts have ancient rights which must be respected . But you newcomers have rights too . Would it not be sensible if you shared the ocean in this way ? ' And when he handed down a verdict worthy of a judge , the combatants accepted it , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the word of Cap'n Mike is as good as we 'll ever get . ' From Kodiak he sailed westward to the Aleutians proper , putting in at Unalaska , where he learned from six daring shipwrecked sailors , who had made it through great hardship to that haven , that twenty of their mates were still marooned on the north coast of the big Unimak Island to the east . Diverting his cruise to that bleak island , he rescued the men , sailed back to Unalaska , and paid with government funds for the forwarding of all twenty-six sailors to Kodiak , where they would transship to San Francisco . From Unalaska he sailed across the Bering Sea  --  for he always chose this in preference to the Pacific Ocean , since that sea was in a certain sense his body of water  --  to one of his favorite towns , Petropavlovsk , at the southern end of the Kamchatka Peninsula . In this beautiful land-protected harbor he met with old friends , learned from them what had been happening along the Siberian coast and where tribal wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arm of their marine police , the last nights ashore were riotous and drunken affairs , with Mike Healy being lugged back aboard the Corwin in time for a dawn departure to the north . His next stop , at Cape Navarin , far distant from Petropavlovsk , had great significance this year and would have even more for the years ahead . Heaving to off the forbidding coast , he fired a salute which brought ten or fifteen canoes speeding out to the Corwin , where normally there would have been only a sullen silence . But Healy had raised the American flag , and now men and women who had some years before rescued sailors from an American shipwreck clambered up the sides of the Corwin to greet these new Americans . When all were aboard , Healy lined them up as if they were dignitaries representing an alien potentate , then fired another salute and had his bugler blow assembly . In broken Russian , which only a few of the Siberians who spoke only Chukchi would have understood had it been perfect , Healy said with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance : The Great Ruler in Washington always knows when someone of good spirit aids an American who is in danger . You and you and you went out into the sea to rescue our sailors from the doomed  | ship Altoona , and you kept them in your yurts for more than a year . You delivered them in good health to the rescue ship sent by the Russians , and the Great Ruler in Washington has told me to come here and thank you . ' He then asked that members of the visiting party line up before him so that each could receive a gift of considerable value  --  a saw , a set of tools , enough cloth for three dresses , a parka , a set of kitchen pots , a ceremonial hat with feathers for the chief . On and on the gifts appeared , each one personally chosen by Captain Healy , each one delivered personally by his hands . When the presentations were over , he mumbled to his first mate : Next time an American ship gets wrecked along this coast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting outcome of this good-will visit came by accident , for the Siberians were so gratified by this gesture of appreciation that they insisted upon taking Captain Healy back onshore with them , and while there , his restless imagination forced him to ask : How can you live so well on land that is so poor ? ' and he poked his forefinger into the fat that covered these healthy people , and they explained : Reindeer , ' and they showed him how , at the edge of their village , they maintained pens made of wooden timbers , inside which clustered herds of reindeer , nine owned by one family , thirty to a group of families , perhaps sixty in a community-owned group . What do they eat ? ' and they pointed to a far hill where a shepherd boy tended a herd of free-roaming reindeer that grazed on the tundra moss , and he sent runners , one to replace the shepherd , one to bring him back to the village , and when the boy arrived Healy gave him the belt off his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to have it for his brave behavior three years ago . From Cape Navarin he proceeded up the Siberian coast past St. Lawrence Island and the Diomedes and into the Chukchi Sea , where he stopped at a lonely village whose residents had once traded with him , and they too had troubles which they placed before him , and in his dark-browed way he listened to words he did not begin to comprehend , but finally a sailor who knew some Russian found a Siberian who knew a little , and they pieced together what the problem was and what a reasonable solution would be . Delivering this judgment , he resolved the matter for the time being at least , and one of his men said to him when they were back aboard the Corwin : The Russians at Petropavlovsk would be afraid to come up here and listen to a problem like that , ' and he said with some truth : But this is my ocean . These are my people . ' He ran from Siberia across the Chukchi Sea to an anchorage he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and personal sorrow that a fine missionary , Father Fyodor , had been murdered by a demented man who still roamed loose after all this time because there was no jail in which to incarcerate him . When he was caught and brought before Healy on the Corwin , only a few questions sufficed to show that the poor fellow was incompetent , so he was locked in the brig , which all the cutters had .  | Healy then went ashore to visit with Mrs. Afanasi and her two children , and he heard how Dmitri with his Russian gun had protected his mother against the crazy man , and Healy said : I have aboard ship a medal for a brave lad like you , ' and when the ship was about to sail southward to its other duties , Dmitri was rowed out and Captain Healy rummaged through his pile of gifts and came up with a medal he had bought along the waterfront in San Francisco . It showed an eagle , and as he pinned it on the boy 's tunic he said in his deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' His next stop on this particular trip was at forlorn Point Hope , where winds from the north were incessant and where his lookout spotted a group of white men huddling among sand dunes , and when small boats were sent to investigate , they discovered something so terrible that when Captain Healy , back aboard the Corwin , was told of it , his face turned almost black as he thundered : I want no record of this . No entry in the log . We did not stop here , ' but then impulsively he jumped down into the longboat , sped ashore and gathered the marooned men , treating them gently as if they were his children , and brought them to safety aboard his ship . Then he fled to the sanctuary of his cabin , where his first mate found him caressing his parrot and mumbling : Who knows ? Who knows ? ' We know damned well who knows , ' the mate said in great anger . They 're cannibals . They ate the flesh of their own companions , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they died naturally . ' Who knows ? ' Healy mumbled , whereupon the mate grew bitter : I know , that 's who knows . Henderson knows . And so does Stallings . They 're goddamned cannibals and we wo n't have them aboard this ship . ' Almost pathetically , Mike Healy looked up at his righteous mate and asked : Who knows what you and I would do ? Who goddamned bloody knows ? ' And during the remainder of the trip , till the marooned sailors could be handed over to other authorities , they ate apart , ostracized by the other men , but Captain Healy sat with them to talk of how they had lost their whaler in the ice pack , and he listened attentively as they told of how the timbers strained and cracked and tore apart as the relentless ice continued its crushing advance . Before the next stop he summoned the first mate and said : I want to make an entry in the log . " At Point Hope we rescued six sailors marooned when their whaler Cassiopeia out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Is that all ? No dates ? No disposition ? ' That 's all , ' Healy roared , and when the entry was made he signed it . He next put in at Cape Prince of Wales , a place which was to be of great importance to him in later years and of a determining influence now , for when he was rowed ashore he found a sizable group of Eskimos starving because the catch of seals and whales had been disastrous , and no other food was available . It was here , for the first time , that he said to his officers after they had fed the emaciated natives : How ridiculous ? Over there in Cape Navarin the Eskimos  --  they must be the same people , you go back far enough  --  they had rolls of fat , with no more food from the land than these people over here . What 's the difference ? They have reindeer ... ' It was then  | that his great idea was born : Why not bring a hundred , a thousand reindeer over here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cape Prince of Wales he drifted down to the mouth of the Yukon River , where he dispatched two ship 's boats to go upriver thirty miles , dispensing medicines and news , and when he heard about life along the great river he said : I 'd like to go up it about a thousand miles . ' He was now back in the Bering Sea , and with a long sweep toward the west he came to the north coast of big St. Lawrence Island , and when he anchored off the easternmost settlement of Sevak he expected to be greeted by many canoes , for the Corwin was known to these natives , but in the entire village there was no sign of life . He was in the prow of the first boat ashore , and what he found at first perplexed him and then aroused a bitterness beyond expression , for every single person in Sevak was dead . As they walked about the village , trying to find out what had happened , one of the sailors pointed out that there were no seal bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to eat , sir . They died of starvation . But why ... ? ' The mystery was not solved at Sevak , or even at big Kookoolik , where many natives had lived ; all there , too , were dead , and again there were no seal or walrus bones , but there were clear signs of kegs in which rum had been delivered and molasses distilled . But it was not until the Corwin reached Chibukak that the solution was found , for there a pair of natives from the village of Powooiliak on the southern coast , the one that Captain Schransky had wanted to visit but could not because of the storm , had come to prospect among the ruins , and they said : Much rum . Much molasses . All July , August dancing , lovemaking along the shore . No men in umiaks chasing whales . At end they come to us , begging food . We have none to share . They all die . ' Who did this ? ' Healy fairly bellowed , standing amid desiccated corpses . Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He taught them molasses , took all their ivory . ' Healy did not ask his men to bury the corpses ; there were too many . The major part of an island population had been wiped out , and the man responsible appeared to be outside the law , an empire to himself , bounded by the North Pole and Tahiti , by Lahaina in Hawaii and Canton in China . Now his apprehension became more obligatory than ever , for he was the defiler of a society . But Healy in the Corwin was no match for Schransky in the Erebus , and when toward the finish of this year 's tour of his domain , Healy saw the Erebus off to the west still shooting seals in midocean , he ignored the difference between their two ships and bore down upon him as if he would ram the poacher , but Schransky easily avoided him , moved off to the west , and told his first mate : The Erebus will never be disciplined by a goddamned nigger . ' Captain Michael Healy , Lord Protector of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man striving to make his way in the customs  | hierarchy , he had learned to wear a hat that covered his dark forehead and a large mustache that obscured the blackness about his mouth , so that many people knew him for some time before they realized he was a black man . His father , Michael Morris Healy , was a tough-minded Irish plantation owner in Georgia who took as his wife a marvelous slave woman named Elisa . Together they had ten children of such extraordinary grace and promise that Healy said : It would be a crime to have children like ours grow up to be slaves , ' which would have been the legal situation had they grown to adulthood in Georgia . Therefore , with tremendous personal effort Healy and his wife accomplished the impossible : they spirited their ten children out of Georgia , enrolled them in cooperating Quaker and Catholic schools in the North , and watched them develop into what was probably the outstanding group of black siblings in American history . Four of the boys made historic names for themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; another became a respected doctor of canon law ; Patrick , the third son , early showed the unusual academic talents that carried him to the presidency of Georgetown University , and he was for some twenty years , in the latter part of the nineteenth century , one of America 's leading and most respected educators ; and the fourth son , Mike , ran away from school , went to sea , and became in time one of the most honored captains in the Treasury 's revenue cutter service . Three of the girls became nuns , one ending her career as Mother Superior in a major convent . It is interesting to speculate on where these extraordinary black children acquired their unusual talents , which were recognized by so many white people in so many diverse areas of performance . Certainly , from the courageous behavior of their father they could have inherited the strong character they manifested , but there seems little in this Irishman 's background which would account for their intellectual preeminence , and one can speculate that perhaps this sprang from the remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these years one of the most distinguished groups of brothers and sisters in America , matched perhaps by a comparable group from the Adams family of Massachusetts , but one must remember that the Adams children enjoyed every advantage from childhood on and suffered from no fear of being stigmatized as slaves . The contribution the ten Healys made to America was incomparable , but none of the other children attained the headline prominence of Mike . His feats in the northern seas became legendary , and newspapers reveled in writing about his heroics . Did a group of careless whalers tarry too long off Desolation Point and become icebound , with starvation threatening ? Mike Healy in one of his frail cutters would speed through ice floes that would have crushed an ordinary ship six times over and miraculously find open tracks leading him to the stranded sailors . Did tragedy strike in some remote village on the Siberian coast ? Mike Healy dauntlessly arrived on the scene to save the Russians . Did a whaler sink during a storm in the Bering Sea ? Who rescued the castaways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop at their unpopulated Aleutian island on a hunch . And whomever he rescued , no matter in what lost corner of the arctic , that person could be relied upon to sing his praises when returning to civilization .  | His popularity extended across the nation , and one Canadian in a small western town when asked who the President of the United States was , said without hesitation : Mike Healy . He runs everything . ' But knowledgeable maritime people were not fooled by the adulation he received from the unwitting public ; they were aware that frustration gnawed at him because he proved powerless to drive Emil Schransky from the seas which Healy had taken under his protection . Whenever men who knew the oceans gathered , they marveled at the impunity with which the German captain acted in the seal islands , the way he operated at will in the pelagic-sealing areas , and his flagrant abuse of alcohol and rum and molasses in devastating native villages . Not even the disaster on St. Lawrence Island , which by now was well known among seamen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running to Hawaii or China with his corrupt bounty . He was a thorn in Mike Healy 's side , and the excuse was always given by Mike 's apologists : If only he had a ship as good as Schransky 's , the duel would be even . As it is , he has no chance . ' And because of this imbalance , the image of the huge captain with the white mass of hair and beard continued to haunt the former slave from Georgia . But help was forthcoming , through a route so intricate that no one could have planned it . Dundee , on the east coast of Scotland , was not a major shipbuilding city by any means , but in 1873 a shipyard there , with a reputation for constructing unusual crafts to specification , received an order to build a ship stout enough to withstand the ice fields off Labrador and Greenland , and as a result , in 1874 a stubby , rugged vessel was launched which would , when it finally sank eighty-nine violent years later , be remembered as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ christened the Bear , 198 feet 6 inches stem to stern , 29 feet 9 inches beam , 18 feet 8 inches draft , 1,700 tons displacement . Its construction was an eclectic marvel : hull of Baltic oak , ribs of a heavier Scottish oak , decks of Burma teakwood , prow and sides sheathed with Australian ironwood , bottom of American yellow pine , iron fittings cast in Sweden and the navigation instruments assembled from seven different European and North American maritime nations . The Bear was a three-master rigged as a barkentine  --  big square sails on the foremast , deft little fore-and-aft sails on the main and mizzen masts ? but what made it look like the awkward little powerhouse it proved to be was a full-fledged steam engine forward of the mainmast served by a huge , squat smokestack at midships . When it was delivered to its future owners for work in the North American ice field , its builders promised : Square sails will give you drive , fore-and-afts maneuvering quickness , and the engine the ability to plow through ice . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was treble thick , fortified by oak and ironwood , and capable , said the proud marine architects who devised it , of breaking its way through any ice it faces . ' At that moment , at the beginning of the Bear 's life at sea , it was thought that the ship would serve some routine purpose , but later , when it was dragooned into a rescue operation , it achieved fame on front pages across the world : the American arctic explorer Adolphus Greely had gone bravely  | into the northern waters of the Atlantic , lost his ship in a crushing ice pack and nineteen of his men in the ensuing attempt to walk back to civilization . All rescue efforts by normal ships having failed , the Bear was purchased by the American government for the huge price of a hundred thousand dollars and hurried to the supposed scene of the disaster . Now an entirely different kind of ship was in the arctic , and its doublestout construction enabled it to break its way through ice fields that no other could have penetrated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other survivors . In the aftermath , while the world was applauding this extraordinary ship , someone had the clever idea of transferring it to the revenue cutter service in Alaska , where it would be most useful . Around the Horn it went in November 1885 , arriving in San Francisco after only eighty-seven days at sea . By chance , when the Bear docked , Captain Mike Healy was available for a new command , and without much forethought he was given this well-regarded ship which already had a reputation as exalted as his own . It was a remarkable wedding of man and machine , for when he moved his gear into the captain 's quarters and arranged a perch for his parrot and a hiding place for his booze , he said : This is home , ' but it was only when he saw that amazing prow with its fantastic thickness of ironwood that he dared reissue his earlier oath : Now we drive that bastard from the seas . ' In 1886 , Healy took his new command north , all the way to icebound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscled his way through floes that no ordinary vessel would even have attempted , and luck was already sailing with him , for he rescued three groups of sailors whose ships had been crushed by the ice . When he delivered them back to San Francisco they spent half their praise on Healy , half on the Bear , and thus the legend of the ship was augmented : It can go anywhere . It 'll save a thousand lives up there . And with Healy in command , the seas will be safe . ' In going to and from Barrow , the Bear passed in sight of St. Lawrence Island , and the memory of those three dead villages tormented Mike Healy 's soul , and it infuriated him to think that the Erebus was still prowling these waters and breaking all laws with impunity . Time and again he would cast anchor off some village on the Alaskan coastline , only to find that the Erebus had already been there with its cargo of rum and molasses for which it had obtained two or three years ' supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even catch him , he had to sail disconsolately back to San Francisco and report that the brig Erebus , Captain Schransky , out of New Bedford , has been selling rum to the natives and engaging in pelagic sealing and poaching the rookeries , but an attentive patrol failed to apprehend him . ' Even with his more powerful ship , the Negro Healy could not catch the Nordic Schransky . But when a giant engages in valiant battle , and Mike Healy was a giant , he is often joined by another eager to lend support , and together the two , who might have been strangers six months earlier , achieve miracles . Such a  | second giant was approaching Alaska from the hilly region around Deadhorse , Montana , on a wintry afternoon in February . Sheldon Jackson was that amazing man . Even though he had been warned in the last settlement that a blizzard might be brewing , he was traveling alone . Forty-three years old , he had a complete beard and heavy mustache to make his little face look more dignified , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always to impress strangers favorably despite his diminutive stature . His exact height would always be a matter of debate , for his detractors , a numerous band , claimed that he was under five feet , which was preposterous ; he referred to himself as five four , which was equally absurd ; because he favored built-up shoes , he looked to be about five two . But whatever his height , he often looked a dwarf among men markedly taller than he . Now he plowed ahead through the snow that was beginning to drift , but he had no worry about his ability to make his destination before dark . God wants me to get there , he assured himself , and this was more than enough to fuel his energy , for he was a missionary of the Presbyterian church , absolutely convinced that God intended him for some great work and increasingly suspicious that it might be outside America that he would perform his miracles of conversion . Therefore , when he came to the top of a small hill from which he had been certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town of Deadhorse , population 381 , and found before him no town lights , but only another hill , and this one larger than the last , he merely adjusted his heavy pack , squared his frail shoulders , and said aloud : Well , God , You must have it hiding on the other side of this one , ' and down into the light but swirling snow he marched , stopping now and then to clear his steel-rimmed glasses . The dip was quite deep , but he interpreted this as a protection God had placed around this town , and his enthusiasm flagged not one bit as he reached the bottom and started the upward climb , for it was inconceivable to him that Deadhorse would not lie just beyond the ridge . On his way to the top the snow increased noticeably , but this gave him little concern , for he thought : It 's good that I 'm almost there , because this storm could get bad , and upward he struggled , as secure in his faith as he had been when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flatlands of Arizona . As he neared the top of the hill he was hit by a blast of snow borne by a strong wind that came howling over the crest , and for just a moment his little feet lost their hold and he slipped backward , but he quickly caught himself , struggled to the top , and saw below him , as he had known he would , the flickering lights of Deadhorse . But now a more serious problem arose , for instead of a town of 381 , there stood before him a village of eight houses , well scattered . He had been grossly deceived by the Presbyterians at his last stop , but since they were Presbyterians , he could not think ill of them : Perhaps they never made the trip here themselves . He had in his pocket the name of the man to whom he was being sent , Otto Trumbauer : Sounds more like a Lutheran than a Presbyterian . But  | when he stopped at the first house and asked for the Trumbauers , he was told : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . Trumbauer 's expectin ' you . He 's two houses along , ' and when he knocked on the Trumbauer door , it was flung open with a hearty cry : Reverend , we 've been holdin ' supper for you , ' and he was pulled into the warm room . Mrs. Trumbauer , a hefty woman in her forties , said as she closed the door : You got here just in time . Take off that pack and your coat . ' A son in his twenties and a thin young woman who was apparently his wife helped Jackson get rid of his heavy garments and found a place for him at the waiting table . At supper he learned the bad news , for the elder Trumbauer said : There has to be some mistake . We got only eight families here , two of them are Catholic , two are atheist , and of the other four , only three of us have any interest in starting a Presbyterian church . ' Jackson heard the dismal report with only a slight wince : Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marches forward with what soldiers it has , and you two men look like stout ones . ' He insisted that the two other Presbyterian families be invited in that very night , so that the first meeting of the Deadhorse Presbyterian Church was held while a small blizzard piled snow outside . The adult men , on whom the labor of building even a small church would fall , were not eager to commit themselves to such a task , but Jackson was adamant ; he had been sent to Deadhorse to start a Presbyterian church and he was determined to do so : I do believe I 've organized more than sixty congregations and helped build at least thirty-six church buildings west of the Mississippi , and my commission now is all the Northern states starting west from Iowa . Your fine town is in an ideal spot for a church which will bind this whole area together . ' In succeeding weeks the two male Trumbauers were astonished by the physical and moral energy of this little man who had come on foot over the mountains to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked like the strongest man present , and on Sundays he preached inspired sermons that ran for more than an hour , even though his entire congregation consisted of only three families . However , this changed when he visited the two atheist families and was informed that they were agnostic rather than atheist . Join with us on Sunday , ' he pleaded . You do n't have to believe , just hear the message . ' Then , in what was supposed to be humor , he added in his awkward way : We wo n't take up a collection , ' and he was so sincere in his invitation that one of the families did stop by the Trumbauer house to hear the next Sunday 's sermon . It dealt with missionary work , and during the communal dinner that followed he revealed the sources of his surprising energy : In my freshman year at Union College back east I heard a call : " Sheldon , there are people overseas who do not know the Word of God . Go to them , take them My Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You said you worked in Arizona and Colorado . ' When I graduated from Princeton Theological , I went before an examining board for the foreign missions , and their doctors said : " You 're too frail and weak for service in foreign countries , " so they sent me to Colorado and  | Wyoming and Utah , where I helped build church after church , and now I 'm in one of the most demanding regions of all , Montana and Idaho . ' What do you mean , ' a young man asked , when you say " I heard a call " ? ' and Jackson replied with startling vigor : Sometimes to some people you 're standing alone in a room or you 've been praying , and Jesus Christ himself comes into that room and says in a voice so plain it sounds like a bell : " Sheldon , I want you for my work , " and ever after your feet are headed in that direction and you are powerless to turn aside . ' No one spoke , so he ended : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of His churches to be built , and with your help , not mine , it will be built . ' He was being too modest , for his contribution to the small log building was tremendous ; he worked nine and ten hours a day at the most difficult jobs of construction , and sometimes the women laughed when they saw him coming down the road carrying one end of a log while some huge young fellow struggled with the other end . He was good with a hammer if he could have the help of one of the homemade ladders , but always on Sunday he was prepared for his sermon , and had the ones he delivered at Deadhorse been collected in a small booklet , they would have provided a logical exposition of the philosophy that underlay the missionary effort . But what staggered the three local families was that in addition to his day 's labor and his Sunday sermons , the little man spent most of his nights after supper writing voluminous copy for a popular religious journal he had started in Denver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the log church neared completion , the Trumbauers and their Presbyterian friends recognized Jackson as a true man of God , a Christian without a flaw , and they were pleased to have known him . Mrs. Trumbauer said , as the time approached for his departure for some town in Idaho that needed a church : I 've never had a man in the house , not even my own father or Otto 's , who caused me less trouble . Sheldon Jackson is a saint . ' And then she added : Had n't we better tell him ? It might break his heart to find out later . ' The families held private discussions in another home and concluded that if one balanced the honorable with the practical , the best course would be to finish the church , have a big dedication ceremony , and then tell him , and that was the plan that was followed . When the time approached for committing this church to the service of Jesus Christ , Jackson went humbly to the nonreligious families and pleaded with them to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole community , not just a few Presbyterians , ' and then , stifling his pride and his convictions , for he waged unceasing war against Catholics and Mormons , he went to the Catholic families and invited them also to the celebration , using much the same arguments : I will be dedicating a church . You will be helping the community to take a step forward . ' He was so persuasive that on the Thursday , a day of the week that he specifically chose so that the agnostics and the Catholics would feel free to participate , which they did , he preached a sermon that was a marvel of friendliness and devotion . All his customary exhortation was muted , and to listen to him , the Presbyterian church had not an enemy in the world nor was there any other Christian denomination with which it was at odds . Most earnestly he wanted this  | church to be a force for good in a community which he was sure would be a growing one . And at the feasting he moved from family to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the opening of this church , a new day was dawning in Deadhorse , and he was so convinced by his own rhetoric that when he saw tears in the eyes of the Presbyterian women , he assumed that they were the joyous tears of Christian triumph . They were not , but it had been agreed by the three families that they would wait till Jackson was packed for his move into Idaho before telling him the painful news , but one night when he was busy in the Trumbauer dining room finishing a report for his Denver publication  --  it dealt with the triumph of Jesus Christ 's message in the town of Deadhorse , Montana , a settlement he refused to call a village  --  Otto Trumbauer coughed and said : Reverend Jackson , ' and when the little fellow looked up he saw the entire Trumbauer family ranged before him . Obviously , something of moment had agitated these good people , but what it was he could never have guessed . Reverend Jackson , we 've tried every way on earth to avoid this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamberts , we 're movin ' back to Iowa . Our families have farms for us to work there , and we can earn a livin ' , somethin ' we ca n't do here . ' Jackson dropped his pencil , looked up , wiped his glasses meticulously , and asked for confirmation of the astounding news : Iowa ? You 're leaving here ? ' We got to . No future for our children here . Nor for us . ' For the first time since he was trapped in the growing blizzard , Sheldon Jackson allowed his shoulders to sag , but then he tensed them for the Lord 's work : Why , if you knew you were leaving . . . ? ' Did we stay to help build the church ? ' Mr. Trumbauer finished the question , but he was not allowed to give the answer ; his wife did : We discussed that , all the families , and we decided that you were a true man of God sent to us on a special mission . ' She burst into tears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We agreed that we would build the church and leave it as a beacon in the wilderness . ' Jackson squared his shoulders , rose , and grasped in turn the hands of all the Trumbauers : You were right in your decision ! God always directs us in the right path ! I started six , maybe eight churches in the Colorado mountains that never took hold , but there they stand , as you say , beacons in the mountains to remind those who will come later that Christians once labored here . ' But then his indomitable optimism manifested itself : But this town will never become a wilderness ! I see expansion , families moving here from the Dakotas , and when they arrive , there 'll be your church waiting for them , for no collection of houses is ever a town without a church at its center . ' He left Deadhorse in a state of positive euphoria , a little man with a big pack , eyeglasses that collected mist and dust , and a conviction rooted in rock that the work he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus Christ , but the judgment which Mrs. Trumbauer voiced as he departed ? ' Reverend Jackson , you 're a saint without a flaw ' ? was far  | from true , for he had another side to his nature which had not had an opportunity to reveal itself during his constructive visit to Deadhorse . On the snowy day that Sheldon Jackson left Deadhorse , Montana , to push westward , an informal gathering of the board which governed Presbyterian missions convened during a retreat in a rural setting overlooking the Hudson River in New York . A tall , worried clergyman , who obviously wanted to be fair , started the afternoon 's discussion with an announcement which brought discomfort to all who heard it : As your chairman it 's my duty to be scrupulously just in what I say , but I must advise you that our dear and respected friend Sheldon Jackson has done it again . We do n't know where he is or what he 's up to . After we took him out of Colorado , where he , as you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders for a while , taking proper steps to develop the area we assigned him . ' Which was ? ' a minister asked . The Northern states and territories west of the Mississippi , but not including Dakota , the state of Oregon or the territory of Washington . ' That 's a vast area , even for Jackson . Where 's he supposed to be ? ' We directed him to work in Montana . Where he actually is , who can guess . ' Is n't it about time , ' an impatient clergyman in his sixties asked , that we discipline this young man ? ' He 's not so young , you know . Must be in his forties . ' Old enough to behave himself . ' That he will never do , ' the chairman said as he produced a single sheet of notes . But before we take any action regarding this little hurricane , I want to bring before you eight aspects of his behavior , for he is consistent , and the first three refer to the finest attributes any missionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From his earliest days at Union College he had a specific calling to Christ , and whereas he is not loath to challenge the veracity of your calling or mine , he never doubts the authenticity of his . He is therefore by his definition a better missionary than you or I , . and he is not afraid to point this out . Second , he has , from early childhood , been a committed Presbyterian . He believes without question that ours is the world 's superior religion , and the doubts that assail the rest of us from time to time , the great debates about the nature of God and the paths to salvation never touch him . The two Johns , Knox and Calvin in that order , settled it for him ! ' The clergymen discussed this second point for some time , and one man spoke for several : To have a faith as solid as that . . . maybe I envy him , ' but another minister from New York cautioned : You may have used the wrong word , Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knows what he 's for and what he 's against . ' For example ? ' Charles asked , and the speaker ticked off his response : He 's for Jesus Christ and against Catholics , Mormons and Democrats . ' Charles did not laugh : I wish I knew even ten things for sure . . . no  | questions , no doubts . Jackson knows ten thousand . ' And the second speaker said : And he 's convinced that you and I do n't know even three . ' The chairman continued : Out of this rock-solid conviction comes the third attribute you 've all noticed , his remarkable gift for persuading others to listen to him attentively . Small , contentious , single-minded , you 'd expect him to turn people away , but it 's just the opposite . He attracts them the way honey attracts flies , and they 'll listen to him discuss the basic principles of religion and particularly the work of missionaries . ' At this point the discussion stopped , and the clergymen reflected on the positive attributes of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surprising ability to cooperate with the other Protestant denominations , but most had felt the lash of his venomous tongue , and after a pause , which included the nodding of heads in agreement with what had been said so far , the analysis continued : Fourth , and this fault had better be admitted up front , for it accounts for many of the problems we 've had with Jackson and will have in the future . For a devout Christian , which he certainly is , and a man who has devoted his life to missionary work , he displays a singular skill in going for the jugular of anyone whom he considers an enemy . This accounts for the fact that if you take a hundred of his acquaintances in either Colorado , Washington or the church in general , you find fifty of them revering him as a saint , fifty reviling him as a serpent . ' This called for a show of hands among those present , and the score was saint three , serpent fourteen , with many of the latter eager to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth the effort . But these same men nodded in agreement when one sagacious elder pointed out the fundamental fact about Jackson 's place among the Presbyterians : He is our front-line general in the fight against darkness . He 's the one , above all others , who ensures that our efforts in the field equal those of the Baptists and Methodists . Like him or not , he is our man . ' I was coming to that , ' said the chairman , who had been repeatedly savaged by Jackson , for he does have his virtues . Fifth , early in life , for reasons not easy to explain , he developed a conviction that if he wanted something , he should go right to the top . Have you ever visited Washington with him when he wants something important ? He slams his way into someone 's office  --  congressman , senator , cabinet ministers , the President himself . He told me once after having lectured a senator : " These are good men , but they need guidance , " and he 's ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've often wondered why a man so small , so insignificant , can bully a senator six feet tall , but he does . ' Several men testified to Jackson 's extraordinary power in Washington , and one said : He 's made himself the voice of morality , especially Presbyterian morality , and that counts for something . ' The chairman now came to one of the fundamental talents of Sheldon Jackson : Sixth , his power stems from his capacity to convince large numbers of women church members to support whatever program he 's fostering at the moment . They 'll write letters to Washington and , most important , contribute large sums of money for his various projects , like that extraordi-  | nary church newspaper he still publishes in Denver , although he has n't been there for years . He depends upon these women , beseeches them for funds , and thus places himself somewhat beyond our control . ' A choleric minister who had often been the subject of Jackson 's vituperative attacks said : I watched him address a group of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was using the approaches that he 'd found productive in Western states like Colorado and Iowa . He warned them about the dangers posed by the Catholic church , but they 'd heard enough of that in Massachusetts and Maine . He saw he was n't getting anywhere , so he switched to a hard-hitting expose of the Mormon church in Utah , but most of them had never heard of the Mormon church , so that fell flat . Obviously agitated  --  I could see he was perspiring  --  he suddenly launched into a heartrending account of guess what ? Out of the blue , with no preparation whatever , he gave them a tearful account of how Eskimo girls in Alaska were being seduced at the age of thirteen by rascally goldminers , and his pictures were so vivid and lamentable that even I had tears in my eyes . Now , he 's never been to Alaska , knows nothing about it , but he convinced those good Presbyterian women that unless they contributed heavily to the mission work he was planning for Alaska .. Who said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergyman shouted , and the informant said : He did . That is , he did n't actually say we were sending him . He said he was going . ' Surveying the group almost belligerently , the chairman asked : Did anyone here mention Alaska to him ? ' and one clergyman said : The last place on earth we 'd want him meddling . That 's Oregon territory . Tell him to mind his own business , ' and several members mumbled : Amen . ' So the chairman returned to his bill of indictment , but before he could speak to the next point he was interrupted by chuckling coming from the group 's oldest member . Did I say anything improper ? ' the chairman asked , and the man said : Heavens , no ! I was just recalling that I was on the committee that interviewed Jackson years ago when he wanted to be one of our overseas missionaries . I read him our verdict : " You 're too frail for the hard work of an overseas post . " ' When the gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the laughter . Seventh , ' resumed the chair , he 's displayed an insatiable appetite for publicity . From the first he 's appreciated the power that can come to a man , particularly a clergyman , if he 's seen by the press to be an agent for good . He saw early that this would protect him from bodies like ours who might not want to support his more outrageous plans . And he was never willing to leave good publicity to chance ; as you know , he started or had others start some four or five religious newspapers or journals in which his good works are extolled and in whose columns it is always he who accomplishes things and not the hardworking missionaries who work in silence . Since he acquired that honorary degree from that little college in Indiana , and I have reason to believe he initiated it , he always refers to himself in his journals as Dr. Sheldon Jackson , and nine-tenths of the people who work with him are convinced that he really earned a doctorate in divinity . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at pro-  | moting himself , and there were notes of envy as they recalled one illustrated article after another which spoke of his heroic efforts , but then the meeting closed with an almost irrelevant comment , Item Eight : Jackson has always been an ardent Republican who believes that when the United States government is in such hands , God smiles upon our nation , and that when Democrats come into power , the forces of evil are set loose . This outspoken devotion aids Presbyterianism when the Republicans are in control of the nation , as they have been for so long , but it could damage us if the Democrats ever took over . ' In the discussion that followed , it was agreed that since the Democrats were not likely to assume national power in the foreseeable future , the Presbyterians might as well run the risk of allowing Jackson to continue as their spokesman in Washington , but all were firm about the resolution which the board passed at the end of their meeting : Resolved : that the Reverend Sheldon Jackson be complimented on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be admonished to keep this Board informed of any future movements before he makes them . He is specifically directed not to move into Oregon or Alaska , since those areas are the domain of the Oregon church . But even before these stern directions could be handed to a secretary for transmission to Jackson , a messenger arrived at the retreat with a communication from distraught church leaders in Oregon : The Reverend Sheldon Jackson appeared in our midst without warning and proceeded to infuriate everyone . After creating a great disturbance , he left us for Seattle and Alaska . When we warned him that the latter was Oregon 's responsibility , he told us bluntly that he read his commission to include everything from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean and that it was time someone attended to Alaska . We informed him that our church already had missionaries in place in Wrangell , but he retorted : I mean a real missionary , ' and he sailed north . In this abrupt and unauthorized manner Jackson carried the Word of God and the salvation of Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that for the first seven definitive years of his mission he received not a penny of aid from the Presbyterian church , which was outraged by his insolent behavior . He paid the huge expenses of the Alaskan experiment , one of the most successful in American missionary efforts , solely from the funds turned over to him by adoring women whom he visited each winter on hortatory expeditions . At a time when he was accomplishing miracles in the frozen north , he spent half of each year back in various states imploring women 's groups for help , or in Washington hectoring Congress for better laws and more money for Alaska . He became the close personal friend of almost everyone in government who was destined for spectacular promotion , especially those who were  | Republican or Presbyterian , which was how he attached himself early to the coattails of Senator Benjamin Harrison of Indiana , who was both , and who , when he became President , would look to Jackson for counsel as to what should be done in Alaska . At a mere five feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Presbyterian minister had transformed himself into a giant . When Dr. Jackson arrived in Alaska , illegally his opponents said , he put his tremendous ingenuity to work , and achieved two brilliant successes : he persuaded his friends in Congress to grant him the resounding title of General Agent for Education for Alaska , which carried no salary and for the early years no government funds , but which did empower him to have impressive calling cards made which he used to bully anyone opposing his plans ; and he hectored the Treasury Department into assigning him free passage aboard any of its revenue cutters that were sailing to any point that he wished to visit in the execution of his duties . With these assurances in his pocket and with the continued financial support of the women 's clubs back home , he was prepared to set forth on his life 's work : the humanization and education of Alaska . In these beginning years Jackson led a frenetic life . During the spring and summer months he jumped aboard any available cutter to explore the arctic seas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help dispense law , visit Siberia , plan the development of Alaska , and with his own money provide many of the services which the government should have funded . Then , for the six months of fall and winter , he would be back in Washington or New York or Boston , lobbying and lecturing on the future of Alaska . During one typical twelve-month period he traveled 37,624 miles , and a fellow clergyman guessed that in that time he had given not less than two hundred lectures on behalf of Alaskan education : ' Sheldon 's ready to launch into a lecture if he can find an audience of six . ' But whenever he was on the verge of achieving some improvement , he found himself frustrated by the fact that the United States still refused to provide Alaska with any kind of government or adequate tax base , and in his frustration he would roar back to Washington , breathing fire , to bombard Congress . It was there , with his traditional foresight , that he formed his close acquaintanceship with the promising senator from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The senator listened to his pleas for a law that would enable Alaska to govern itself , became convinced by Jackson 's moral force , and in 1883 began to work in the Senate for such a law . In 1884 , spurred vigorously by Jackson , Senator Harrison finally maneuvered through Congress an Organic Act , giving Alaska a civil government of sorts , with one judge , one district attorney , one clerk of court , one marshal  --  four deputies to bring law and order to an area of more than five hundred thousand square miles . It was pathetically inadequate , but a step in the right direction . Jackson , of course , had hoped for self-governing territorial status , but Congress would not concede this , for it would have implied that sooner or later the territory would become a state , as all the other emerging sections  | of the United States were doing , and that , ranted the lawmakers , was preposterous : That icebox will never have enough people to become a state . " Self-government ? Hell , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white people of course . " If the Army do n't govern it , the Navy should . ' But not even Jackson appreciated the almost fatal inadequacy of the bill he and Harrison had helped pass ; he learned , however , when he returned that spring to Sitka , for he had not been in his summer home two hours before he was visited by an irate Carl Caldwell , the former lawyer from Oregon and now a leading citizen of Alaska : What did you allow Congress to do , Dr. Jackson ? ' We did n't allow it . Harrison and I forced it . ' But the Oregon bit ? That nullified everything . ' Now wait , ' Jackson said defensively . Congress refused to give us territorial status . Best we could get was that we should be governed by the same local laws as Oregon . ' At this , Caldwell leaped from his chair : ' If it was the laws of Oregon , it would be all right . What you gave us are the ancient laws of the territory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're taking us back to the way Oregon was in 1858 , ' and when he spelled out the monstrous limitations this placed on Alaska , Jackson sat with mouth agape : We ca n't have jury trials in Alaska because Oregon territorial law said that to be eligible , jury members must be taxpayers . ' Sensible rule , ' Jackson said . Provides responsible men for jury duty . ' But we have no taxes in Alaska ; therefore , no juries . ' When Jackson gasped , he continued : Many of the best laws in Oregon Territory related to counties , but we ca n't have any of those laws because we have no counties . ' That 's ridiculous , ' the missionary who fathered the law grumbled , but Caldwell was far from finished with his critique : No one can buy land here , because Oregon 's law made no provision for a land law . Worse , for the same reason , the great Homestead Act which has settled the West ca n't be used here to give settlers free land . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local legislature because Oregon in those days did n't have one . ' On and on he went , sometimes showing Jackson chapter and line of the antiquated law , so that by the time he was finished , Jackson realized that with his help Congress had returned Alaska to a straitjacket ; he saw that he would have to fight most of his battles all over again , and he began that night to flood Congress with new letters of advice and his women supporters with new appeals for funds , because when he engaged in battle , there was no truce , no surrender . But it was not until the new officers authorized by the Organic Act of 1884 arrived in Sitka to take control of Alaska that he realized the jeopardy he was in , because President Chester Arthur , under almost unendurable pressures from office seekers , had appointed some of the most despicable rascals available at the time , and from the moment they arrived in Sitka they determined to get rid of the troublesome little missionary about whom miners , fishermen and rumrunners complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney , a notorious drunk . His marshal was little better , but it was the federal judge , a man of enormous power , who was the real disaster . Ward McAllister , Jr. , was the incompetent nephew of the man with the same name who served as social dictator of New York . All had received their appointments to good-paying jobs through the political pull of their friends and without regard to their competency , which was nil . They had not assumed their offices long when , with the connivance of the district attorney and Judge McAllister , they issued in secret an indictment for the arrest of Jackson , then waited till a maximum number of local citizens were at the dock to see the departure of a steamer on which Jackson was to sail . At the last possible moment Deputy Marshal Sullivan went aboard with handcuffs to arrest the little missionary and haul him off to jail . In the next weeks Jackson suffered indignities he could not have imagined , but in the end he was rescued by a most improbable source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , left office , and almost immediately after the Democratic reformer Grover Cleveland assumed the presidency , he canceled the Arthur appointments , replacing them with more standard politicians , who served Alaska well . One of the first things the new team did was quash the indictment of Sheldon Jackson , who nevertheless continued to believe that the nation was served best when Republicans were in power . It was about this time that Jackson participated in one of the most farseeing acts of Alaskan history , one that was rarely if ever duplicated in other newly settled frontiers . Communicating with the leaders of other American churches , he proposed a mutually enforced division of Alaska into a dozen or so religious spheres of influence , each the preserve of one denomination into which proselytizing missionaries from other sects would not intrude . What he proposed was a grand religious truce , and primarily because his reputation as a man of integrity was so widely recognized , leaders of the other groups adopted his suggestion . As he explained it to the people of Sitka : Because the Presbyterians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But since this is the easiest part , we 're also taking the most difficult , Barrow in the extreme north . ' Modestly he added : It 'll be the northernmost mission in the world . ' When he spelled out other terms of the agreement , he sounded like some follower of Jesus in the Book of Acts apportioning the missionary responsibilities of the infant Christian church : Our good friends the Baptists are taking Kodiak Island and lands nearby . The Aleutian Islands , where much work needs to be done , to the Methodists . The Episcopal church picks up the work already done decades ago by their cousin church , the Anglicans of Canada , along the upper Yukon . The Congregationalists have volunteered to accept a most difficult area , Cape Prince of Wales . And a fine church you may not know , the German Moravians of Pennsylvania , are going to take God 's Word along the Kuskokwim River . ' In a later wave of ecumenical enthusiasm , other churches volunteered to become part of this grand arrangement : the Quakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be done , received Kotzebue and  | a mining area near Juneau ; Swedish Evangelists got Unalakleet ; and the Roman Catholics received the vast areas about the mouth of the Yukon which had once been served by the Russian Orthodox missionaries . It was an extraordinary example of ecumenism at its best , and much of the credit went to Jackson . But verbal agreements , noble though they may be , and actual implementation are two vastly different things , and years passed before any of the major American churches implemented their promises . There were no Baptist missions , no Methodist , not even a Quaker . In despair , for he saw the natives of Alaska perishing because the Word of God was denied them , Jackson implored the major churches to get moving , but with no results . He went to Philadelphia to visit with the Quakers , whom he was sure he could persuade to move north , but he accomplished nothing , so in a kind of moral despair he spent a steaming hot night in August 1883 in the Quaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby Bethlehem . He implored them to continue in Alaska the noble work they had begun with the Eskimos of Labrador , and once more he received for his labors nothing but silence . But his letter must have had some effect on the stalwart Germans of Bethlehem , for during Jackson 's visit to the United States in the following winter he received without any preliminary encouragement an invitation to visit Bethlehem and present his vision of Alaska 's needs to the Moravians . Hastily boarding a train in Philadelphia , he journeyed north to the quaint and lovely old German city , where he delivered one of his most inspired orations , telling the audience : The Moravian church has always been in the forefront where missionary work is involved . It 's your tradition , your soul . Now God 's call reaches you one more time : " The Eskimos of Alaska are languishing for My Holy Word . " Dare you say no ? ' The solemn burghers who supervised the church agreed that night that they would send an exploratory mission to the Kuskokwim River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , devout farmers  --  three men , two wives ? saw that great twin of the Yukon and the hunger among the people for medicine , education and Christianity , which they interpreted as the reason why white men prospered , the young missionaries wrote back to Bethlehem : We are needed , ' and one of the finest groups of religious workers ever to reach Alaska followed in due course , and the logjam of indifference was broken . Quickly the Quakers took up their appointed areas , then the Baptists and the Methodists , and soon Alaska was dotted with those missions , often stuck away on remote sites , which would in time account for the civilizing of the Great Land . One day when Jackson was at work in Sitka , the new cutter Bear hove into the sound , and before it could be anchored , Jackson had made the decision which would determine so much Alaskan history : That 's the kind of ship I 'd like to sail in . By midday he had presented his authorization for passage to the first mate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man offering it and said : Captain 'll have to clear this , ' and for the first time the mission-  | ary was led into the quarters of Captain Mike Healy , who had begun to drink heavily the moment the Bear reached Sitka , and who now sat with his parrot on his shoulder . Irritated by this unwarranted intrusion , he let loose a chain of his most violent oaths , glared at Jackson , and ended : Now what in hell do you want ? ' Had the little missionary quailed before this onslaught , the possibility of any relationship between the two men might have died there , but Jackson was a truly fearless man , and drawing himself up to his most impressive posture , he shouted in his strongest oratorical voice : Captain Healy ! I am a man of the cloth , and I do not allow such profanation of God 's name in my presence . And I have also come to Alaska to stamp out the alcohol trade , and you , sir , are drunk . ' Startled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Reverend . . . ' when his parrot came forth with a few choice curses of its own , whereupon Healy cuffed him so that his feathers seemed to fly as he fled to the safety of his perch : Shut up , you ! ' He then turned his attention to his visitor : What does your paper say ? ' It 's from the Treasury Department and it says that I 'm to have free passage aboard your ship as long as I am in pursuit of my duties . ' And what are your duties ? ' The bringing of God 's Word to the Eskimos . The education of the children of Alaska . And the stamping out of the liquor traffic . ' To Jackson 's amazement , Mike Healy , whose life had been saved by education , rose unsteadily , reached for his hand , and pledged a support which would last for twenty years : I 'm for everything you 're for , Reverend . Education saves souls , and strong liquor is the curse of the Alaskan native . ' You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In my private life . As captain of this ship , one of my major duties , stamp out the trafficking in hooch . ' And what is hooch ? ' Rotgut , booze , John Barleycorn . It kills Eskimos . It wipes out entire villages . ' He fell back in his chair , reached for a glass which Jackson had not seen before , and finished his drink . Then he looked up with a roguish smile and said : Bring your gear aboard . We sail for Kodiak and Siberia at four . ' And thus the partnership between these two unlikely men was initiated . Healy was six feet two , five years younger and twenty years more powerful ; Jackson was exactly a foot shorter , so that the top of his head came to Healy 's windpipe . Healy was a believing Roman Catholic , with brothers and sisters occupying important roles in that religion ; Jackson was a devout Presbyterian who , like John Knox before him , railed against Catholics . Healy was a Georgia Negro who legally should have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious ferment which had swept the rural area of upper New York State  --  Elizabeth Cady Stanton , Lucretia Mott and Joseph Smith , to whom the secrets of Mormonism were revealed , sprang from the same source  --  and he believed that Negroes , Indians and Eskimos were humans who deserved God 's love but not social equality with  |  white men . Healy was a man devoted to a profane vocabulary and booze ; Jackson was a man of rectitude who felt it his duty to lecture miscreants and save them from their folly . Their differences were tremendous , and they were never hesitant about displaying them . But they had three beliefs in common , and it overrode all these differences : they both believed that Alaska could be governed if one found men of good will to make the effort ; they were prepared to volunteer for that duty ; and both sought justice for the natives . Their first cruise together sealed their friendship , because whatever difficulty they ran into , they seemed to perceive instantly its moral overtones , and to a startling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now it was no longer Captain Healy of some grubby revenue cutter dispensing rude justice along the shores of the seas ; it was the noble ship Bear steaming into harbor , its engine puffing smoke , with a distinguished ship 's captain aboard , supported by a self-appointed doctor of divinity . They formed a majestic pair , two giants moving into an area that had been pestered by midgets , and after the first visit of this Bear to a new village , the authority of Healy and Jackson was established . On this first trip together they straightened things out at Kodiak , provided stores to the Russian garrison at Petropavlovsk , delivered and enforced a set of judgments along the Siberian coast , and wound up at Cape Navarin , whose settlers streamed out in canoes once they learned that Captain Healy was back , for they remembered the gifts with which he had been so generous on his last trip . It was here that Healy took Jackson ashore to inspect the reindeer herds upon which these Siberians lived so bountifully , but the missionary did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he had not yet seen Alaskan Eskimos starving for lack of winter food . Reindeer ! ' Healy cried . You load the Bear with them , a good wind offshore , and two days later you land them in Alaska . ' Would that be possible ? ' We could do it right now if we had the authority , and the money to pay these people for their surplus . ' The two Americans became so excited by the prospect of utilizing Siberian experience to save Alaskan lives that they assembled the herders of Cape Navarin , and Healy harangued them about the possibility of a trans-Bering trade in reindeer , and when he told them what they would receive in return , they became so enthusiastic that Healy told Jackson : When you get to Washington , see if funds are available . ' But are the reindeer that necessary ? ' You 'll see . ' And when they crossed the Chukchi Sea and landed at a chain of settlements  --  Barrow , Desolation , Point Hope , Cape Wales  --  and Jackson saw the devastation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reached a firm conclusion : Captain Healy , you and I must do two things to save the Eskimos . Bring them a mission which has a school attached , and bring them reindeer . ' On the way home the Bear diverted for a stop at St. Lawrence Island , where Healy showed his missionary friend the ruination wrought by the  | rum and molasses from the Erebus . Jackson was appalled when he saw the skeletons still lying about , and that night as the sturdy Bear plowed southward he sought out Healy as he conned the ship on its way through the Bering Sea : Captain , if you were the man who discovered the death of those villages , and if you knew the reason , how can you possibly go on drinking ? ' I 'm not perfect , ' Healy said . And if you were perfect , you would n't have so many good people mad at you . . . I mean , disgusted with you . ' Drunkards , miners with no conscience , the riffraff of Sitka  --  I welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the good people . Oh , I learned a lot about you in Seattle before I met you . ' I was put on earth by God to do His will , and I must do it my own way . ' I was put on earth by who knows ? I was put here to sail a ship , and I do it my way . ' So these two imperfect men , each of whom would have enemies as long as he worked in Alaska , sailed southward with visions of what they hoped to accomplish : to Christianize the Eskimos , to bring order to the oceans , to transfer deer from Siberia to Alaska , to educate , to educate . On this last ideal they both agreed , as the dramatic events of their second trip together would prove . They were only a few days out when Jackson , under the cold northern stars of October , asked : Captain , you never mentioned the Erebus before we reached St. Lawrence , but it eats at your soul , does n't it ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it ? ' and in a flood of profanity Healy told of his endless struggle with this renegade ship , of the cruel way it flouted the laws that were supposed to protect not only Eskimos but walruses and seals : He lurks out there in the spring , against the laws of all nations , and he waits for helpless female seals , pregnant , swimming north to give birth , and he guns them down with rifles and rips out the baby seals to sell the soft skins to China . ' He should be destroyed , ' Jackson said , and Healy told him : With this ship under me , I could destroy him , ' and he retreated to his cabin , where he got drunk . In the latter days of the trip Jackson remained on deck a good deal , a small man decked out in sealskin garments obtained in Siberia . When sailors asked him what he was doing , he gave evasive answers , for he was on a kind of fool 's chase : he wanted to spot the Erebus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already hated , and late one afternoon he did spy a black ship , or so it seemed , far to the west , and he ran to inform Captain Healy . It 's the bastard , ' Healy cried . Look , you can see his white hair in the glass , ' and there , commanding his outlaw ship , stood Emil Schransky , who had spotted the Bear long before the Bear had spotted him . He had heard that Captain Healy had a new cutter but he did not believe the tales told of it , and especially he scorned the man in charge of it : No damned nigger can outsail me ! ' But at the moment when in the past he had unfurled his great black sails to play cat-and-mouse with the slow cutters that Healy had been using , he  | realized that he was facing a much different kind of ship . He saw the smokestack belching a black cloud , the oversize square sails opening to embrace the wind and , most frightening , that formidable prow doublesheathed in oak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' for even as his sailors insolently broke out the last bank of canvas they saw to their consternation that the Bear had outsmarted them , had turned on a sixpence to head directly at them . He 's trying to ram us ! ' Schransky cried in unhidden fear , and he was right , for Mike Healy , this despised black captain , was about to smash his terrible prow right into the midships of the Erebus . Hard aport ! ' Schransky bellowed to his steersman , and the man tried to turn the dark ship parallel to the course of the Bear so that the latter would glide harmlessly past , as in former duels . But this time Healy possessed his old wiles plus a powerful new ship in which to perform them , and standing amidships with his parrot screeching on his shoulder , he gave precise orders to his helmsman , who whipped the Bear about to send her crashing thunderously into the splintering timbers of the Erebus . Grinding on , propelled by the engine , the prow locked tight in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Healy , the loser in so many previous encounters , gave commands which he had rehearsed : Gunners , stand ready to rake their decks ! Sailors , board ! ' And an astonished Schransky , rendered impotent by this combination of a superior ship captained by a superior mariner , had to stand mute in a posture of surrender as Healy 's victorious men swarmed aboard . As Healy left the Bear to stride onto the Erebus , he saluted its captain , as the rules of the sea required , and then , with his revolver at the ready , he smiled coldly at Schransky and sent his men rampaging through the bowels of the captured ship . His many previous humiliations were handsomely avenged , and both he and Schransky knew it . His officers found the kegs loaded with rum and molasses ; others came upon the holds filled with sealskins . All overboard ! ' Healy commanded , and Schransky 's men had to watch in sullen silence as the heads of the kegs were bashed in and the contents poured into the scuppers . Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and into the dark Bering Sea they went . It was only at this point that Sheldon Jackson felt free to leave the Bear and step onto the Erebus , and when Captain Schransky saw him in his preposterous sealskin uniform he thundered : And who in hell is he ? ' and Healy replied : The man who brought us here , the one who spotted you first . ' Throw him overboard too , ' Schransky growled , but now Healy delivered his ultimatum : Look at my ship , Schransky . Study that prow which cut right through you , that engine . There 's a new day in Alaska , Schransky . If I ever see you in the Bering Sea again , I 'm going to overtake you and ram you and send you to the bottom , with all hands . ' As he stood there in the growing darkness , preparing to give the orders  | that would retract the Bear from the gaping hole in the Erebus , he was two inches shorter than the German , many shades darker , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life and after many defeats , but at long last he was in command of the Bering Sea , and he was determined to remain so . When he returned to his own ship he left Jackson behind on the Erebus , and there were many things about which the little missionary wanted to lecture the big blond captain , especially those destroyed villages on St. Lawrence Island , and he opened his mouth to start his preaching , but when he looked up at that mammoth head so much higher and tougher than his own , he judged that silence was advisable , so without speaking he stepped gingerly across the shattered timbers and returned to his quarters . It was Jackson 's second trip with Healy that changed missions from mudroofed hovels into true churches and schools , for when the rugged Bear steamed out of Sitka Sound , its smokestack belching sparks , every available corner of the deck was crammed with lumber , and ready-made doors and roof beams . Behind it trailed an old schooner piled with additional timber . This year the Bear did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; instead , it plowed ahead through heavy Bering Sea storms to a first stop at Cape Prince of Wales , where two Congregational missionaries had for two years tried to survive in a hovel half underground . When the Bear dropped anchor on the Fourth of July , these surprised young men saw three ship 's boats setting out from the mother ship , laden with lumber and sailors , and when the latter climbed ashore and unloaded their cargo , they did not merely deposit it there for the missionaries to use ; they turned to and began that afternoon building them a church and a school . That evening , as if to celebrate the holiday , the trailing schooner pulled in with the bulk of the timber , and the next morning Captain Healy himself joined the work crew , while Dr. Jackson scurried about , helping to dig the foundation trenches for the walls . Every man aboard the Bear except the cook worked on this mission church , and at the end of eight days they turned over to the astounded missionaries a center from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bear moved on to Point Hope , one of the loneliest villages in the world , the sailors who went ashore to work on the mission building were introduced to the Alaskan mosquito : it came in three versions , one more ferocious than the next , each strain thriving about three weeks in late spring and early summer . They took turns , as if to say : We 'll send in the little ones to make people nervous , then the medium size , and three weeks later the giants . ' They were fierce enemies , able to penetrate any opening in the clothes and bite deeply , until they sent some men almost crazy . What do you do when these things hit ? ' a sailor asked the lone missionary , and he said : You give thanks they last only about nine weeks , ' and the sailor whined : I want to go back to Cape Wales and civilization . ' On the second day at anchor , Healy and Jackson joined the workers ashore , and again a solid church was built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved for the next anchorage , farthest Barrow , where  | the world ends and the Arctic Ocean piles its ice nine months of the year and the sun vanishes completely for three months and more or less for five . Here the sailors met a missionary who was striving to implement Jackson 's vision of civilization advancing through the Word of God to the most remote corners of the world . Through Captain Healy 's energetic intervention , space was secured in a government building to serve as temporary school-mission until his sailors could erect a regular structure , one strong enough to withstand the rigors of Barrow , where in this year not one house rose more than three or four feet above the ground . So Healy and his men worked with special care to make this Presbyterian mission a building that would withstand the pressures of the arctic for decades . After eleven days they turned over to the young missionary a rural masterpiece , a church that would illuminate the little village to which whaling vessels came in June , and where they perished in ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after leaving Barrow , and firing a parting salute to the new church which loomed like a beautiful volcano above the shacks of the village , the Bear swung into shore and anchored off the little wind-swept village of Desolation Point , where the residents clustered on the shore to greet the captain who in the past had meant so much to the security and prosperity of their settlement . Healy waved to them all , but not seeing a certain individual , he called out : Where 's Dmitri ? ' and a villager said : He 's Father Dmitri now . Here he comes , ' and from up the shore came an umiak containing a young man and one passenger , a woman . When it came closer , Healy saw that the man was the same young man who as a boy some years ago had protected his mother from the madman Agulaak . He was twenty-three now , a selfordained missionary who had assumed in Desolation the leadership position once filled by his murdered father . When Jackson met him , the young man explained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which his father belonged , and now began one of the uglier demonstrations of Jackson 's behavior in remote areas . When he went ashore with Dmitri and his mother he said bluntly : We 've brought you a real church . The sailors will start building it tomorrow , but it 's to be a Presbyterian church , so you really must become a Presbyterian missionary . ' We 're Russian , ' the widow of the martyred Father Fyodor said , but Jackson overrode this : You 're American , and there 's no place in our society for a Russian church . ' When he learned that Dmitri , who was revered as Father Dmitri by everyone in Desolation , was teaching the children in the village the Cyrillic alphabet , he said to the crew of the Bear : The wrong religion in the wrong language , ' and forthwith he launched an unabashed campaign to persuade  --  and when this failed , to force  --  Dmitri to convert to Presbyterianism : After all , you must remember , Dmitri , that we Presbyterians were given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dmitri refused apostasy , in which he was supported by his mother even though she had herself been born of Athapascan parents who now favored Methodism , Jackson became unpleasant , threatening him with the  | loss of the church and school the sailors had begun to build : We did n't bring all that lumber here to build a church for Russians . It 's an American church and it 's to have an American missionary . ' The likelihood that his obstinacy might cost his village the bright new buildings it so badly needed caused Dmitri so much grief that he consulted with his mother , who surprised him by taking from the little store of treasures she kept wrapped in a cloth behind a log pole in their underground hut the medal that Captain Healy had given her son so many years ago : He gave it to you because you had been brave . You should still be brave and not allow the little one to make you surrender your father 's religion . ' At her insistence , Dmitri waited till Reverend Jackson was busy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build despite his threat not to do so , for he was convinced that Dmitri would eventually appreciate the tremendous advantage of turning Presbyterian , both for himself and for the village . Then , making sure that Jackson did not see him , Dmitri jumped into the small umiak he had used when the Bear first anchored , and before long he was aboard the ship . Asking for permission to speak with the captain , he was ushered into Healy 's quarters , where he was startled both by the parrot and the fact that the captain was close to being drunk . But when Healy , a good Catholic , learned what his trusted friend , the little missionary , was up to  --  the conversion of a good Russian Catholic into a Presbyterian  --  he sobered in a hurry , jumped down into Dmitri 's umiak , and ordered the young priest , or would-be priest , to take him ashore . Once there , he hurried to where the school was being built , grabbed Jackson by the sealskin under his chin , and demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this boy ? ' There was a confused attempt at explanation , a charge of kidnapping by Mrs. Afanasi , who came running up , and a great embarrassment on the part of Dmitri , who had not wanted the incident to develop in this manner . The debate between Jackson and Healy continued for two stressful days , with the missionary arguing that since he had provided the lumber for the buildings , he had a right to say what kind of structure they should go into , and the captain arguing with equal force that since it arrived on the ship which he commanded , he had the privilege of saying how it should be used . Unfortunately , he had an imprecise understanding of the Russian Orthodox priesthood , and when on the second day he learned that Dmitri was planning to marry a local Eskimo girl who was at best a pagan , he became completely confused . His brothers who had high positions in what he called the real Catholic church did not run around getting married , nor did his sisters who were nuns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself , in a church which allows its priests to marry . Nevertheless , he felt obligated to defend any Catholic church , and he did so with vigor , but he had never before argued religion with a moral cyclone like Sheldon Jackson , and when the church and school were finished , they were consecrated as Presbyterian structures , with Father Dmitri taking passage on the Bear to Seattle , where he would , through the help of local Presbyterians , be converted into Reverend Afanasi , the first Inupiat Eskimo to bear that august title .  | But during the trip south to Kodiak , Captain Healy argued with the young man so persuasively , defending Catholicism as the one universal church , that he almost prevailed upon Dmitri to leave the Bear in Kodiak , return by some other ship to Desolation , and operate the new buildings as Catholic structures . But then the matter of Dmitri 's wedding came up , and Healy , who was now quite drunk , stopped trying to understand what was happening . Jackson , who had anticipated this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the captain , and kept him on board the Bear , which carried him to Seattle and the ministrations of the good Presbyterians in that city . In this manner , Desolation Point became a fountainhead of Presbyterianism in the north . During one of Sheldon Jackson 's later cruises , the Bear was at sea for more than six months , and the missionary became aware that two of the junior officers were showing signs of irritation about having to serve so long away from home port and with a black captain . He overheard one of the young fellows complaining as they finished work on the school at Cape Prince of Wales : Have you noticed that Reverend Jackson , who 's supposed to distribute money and materials impartially , always favors any school run by Presbyterians ? Damn little for Baptists or Methodists , but it 's only natural , him being a Presbyterian and so vehement about it . ' After the Bear touched at Desolation Point , the other officer said : I 'd like to see an accounting of Jackson 's funds . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , and when I asked him about that , he said : " This is my church , " but what that meant he did n't explain and I did n't ask . ' The officers openly voiced their displeasure with Captain Healy when the Bear made a long detour to Cape Navarin for the ridiculous purpose of picking up Siberian reindeer for transplanting to Alaska to feed Eskimos who might otherwise starve . When one man asked : Why are we doing this ? ' the captain replied : To enable good people to stay alive , ' and the other said : If God wanted reindeer to feed Alaskan Eskimos , He 'd have put some on our side of the Bering , ' and Healy replied without rancor : Dr. Jackson might argue that we 're doing work that God overlooked . ' But the young men had cause for complaint , because when the Bear returned to those very natives to whom it had so generously given gifts in appreciation of their assistance in rescuing American seamen , and the ones who had promised they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massively protective of their animals and would not part with a single one . The officers watched with growing bitterness as Healy sailed the Bear more than a thousand miles along the coastline of Siberia , pleading in vain for the stubborn Asians to sell him reindeer , and the young men also noted that Jackson was just as ineffective in trying to buy animals . At the conclusion of this wasteful excursion , one of the officers wrote to his father : This trip has been a shameful waste of government time and money . I begin to suspect that Jackson and Healy are plotting to  | sell their reindeer , if they ever get any , for private gain . The U.S. Gov't. could well investigate this scandal . Despite the fevered efforts of the two would-be humanitarians , they were able to purchase no reindeer at Cape Navarin , but farther north at Cape Dezhnev , where the Siberian coastline turned sharply eastward toward America , they came upon a village which allowed them to buy nineteen of their precious herd , but the same officer wrote : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives of a Great Democracy , they finally purchased nineteen animals , but at a cost per beast that was unconscionable . This whole affair smells . On the choppy trip across the Chukchi Sea three of the reindeer died , but sixteen did survive to become the foundation of a herd in the Aleutians , with more to follow in later years . The court-martial in which Captain Healy would soon find himself enmeshed was partly his own fault , because once he had delivered the reindeer , he should have headed back to his home port of San Francisco to allow his sea-weary crew shore leave . But he was so enamored of the Bering Sea that he decided to make one last , quick scout north  --  Jackson would ultimately make thirty-two different trips to the land of the Chukchis  --  and it was on this sortie that he spotted an American whaler , the Adam Foster , engaged in pelagic sealing . Running forward at full sail-and-steam , he drew alongside the offender and ordered his men to board , and when some thirty energetically obeyed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured ship . However , the sealers , who stood to make a great deal of money if they could get their illegal catch to either Hawaii or China , put up a surprising defense , during which Healy suffered a wound to his left shoulder and a bleeding slash along his cheek . Infuriated by this act of what he deemed warfare , he urged his men to subdue the attackers , and when they did he calmed his temper and ordered three reprisals : All rum and molasses into the scuppers . All pelts into the Bering . These six ringleaders and those three who assaulted me , trice them up ! ' Jackson did not know what this horrendous word meant , but the young officers did , and as it was uttered , one moved to Jackson 's side and whispered : Oh , this should not be done ! They 're Americans . ' He made this protest because , erroneously , he believed that in a crisis the clergyman would have to side with him against Captain Healy and his drunken , profane behavior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out , he was wrong . Jackson was not his man ; he was Healy 's . So , much to the officers ' horror , the nine sailors were triced up , that is , their hands were handcuffed behind their backs and ropes were passed through the cuffs and over a yardarm . Crewmen from the Bear then pulled on the loose ends of the ropes , and the miscreants were hauled just far  | enough aloft so their toes could barely reach the deck , and there in fierce agony they remained dangling for seven minutes , after which they were dropped , some of them senseless , to the deck . Standing over them , Healy said : ' You 'll not take arms against a ship of the United States government , ' and one of the officers whispered to Jackson : ' But they did n't take arms , ' and the missionary , who believed that crime deserved punishment , defended Healy : ' The punished men were selling rum and killing pregnant seals . ' Back aboard the Bear , two relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his wounds and the excitement of boarding a ship in midocean , got drunk , and one of the officers sought out Sheldon Jackson for an impassioned discussion of the afternoon 's events : No captain has the right to storm aboard another ship and trice up nine of its sailors . ' ' Captain Healy serves under orders to do just that . Stop unlawful sealing . Punish men and ships that sell alcohol to natives . ' ' But certainly not to trice men up by their wrists behind their backs . Reverend Jackson , that 's inhuman ! ' ' It 's the law of the sea . Always has been . An alternative to hanging . You ought to be glad he did n't keelhaul them . ' The officer , appalled that a clergyman should defend such behavior , was goaded into saying something which , had he been a more sensitive young man , he would have regretted later : ' You do n't sound much like a Christian , defending a man like Healy . ' Jackson rose from where he was seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his full height , looked up into the young man 's eyes , and said : ' Michael Healy in the Bering Sea reminds me of St. Peter on the Lake of Galilee . I 'm sure Sailor Peter was a rough-and-tumble man , but he was Christ 's chosen apostle on whom he founded his first church . The church in Alaska depends upon the good works of Captain Healy . ' This comparison was so odious that the officer cried : ' How can you say that about a man who blasphemes and gets drunk all the time ? ' and when Jackson snapped in reply : ' I dare say Peter used rough language aboard his ship , too , ' the young man stormed from the cabin . Late that night , when Healy was more or less recovered from his bout with the bottle , Jackson went to the captain 's quarters , allowed the parrot to rest on his left shoulder , and said : ' Michael , I 'm afraid you and I have constructed permanent enemies in your young officers . They ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea captain , and they certainly think I ought to be like every minister they knew back home . ' ' They 're young , Sheldon . Never had to captain a ship . Never chased the Erebus back and forth across the Bering Sea . ' ' They think I ought to condemn you because of your blasphemy and your drinking . ' ' I think you should , too . But on the other hand , I think you forgot you were a minister of the Lord when you made young Father Dmitri turn Presbyterian in order to keep the church we gave him . ' To halt such lugubrious thoughts , Healy snapped his fingers : ' They want us to be gods , but we 're only men . '  | The two reprobates talked long into the cold night , speculating now and then on what the young officers might be plotting . They soon found out , for when the Bear doubled back to Kodiak with three prisoners taken at the Pribilofs , the officers dispatched a telegram to the headquarters of the revenue cutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanding officer : Michael Healy , captain of the revenue cutter Bear has been consistently drunk on duty to the impairment of his responsibilities , has repeatedly used vulgar and abusive language against his officers and men , and has behaved with extreme cruelty to nine American sailors from the whaler Adam Foster . As officers under his command , we request that he be court-martialed . By the time the Bear returned to its duty station off the coast of Siberia , the Adam Foster had docked in San Francisco , giving the local newspaper people a horrendous account of its run-in with the Bear and of Captain Healy 's unwarranted tricing up of nine American sailors . However , in the scandal that developed in the California papers , a force much more powerful than the captain of the Adam Foster entered the guerilla warfare against Mike Healy . Mrs. Danforth Weigle , president of the San Francisco Woman 's Christian Temperance Union , had been searching for some time to find a foolproof case against some ship 's captain who abused his men while under the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mike Healy 's behavior , she and her entire membership lodged formal complaints against him , demanding that he be summoned home , court-martialed , and dismissed from the service . Now all the envious people who had felt that this Negro mariner was growing bigger than his britches united to call for his trial and dismissal . Bowing to the public clamor and especially to the pressures brought by the W.C.T.U. , Healy 's superiors had no alternative but to wire him at Kodiak to return immediately to San Francisco to defend himself in a general court-martial against charges of drunkenness , gross and improper behavior toward subordinates and , in the case of nine American sailors , the use of cruel punishment long outmoded in the navies of civilized nations . He had left Kodiak long before the telegram arrived and spent the summer in the far reaches of the northern seas . During his sail south at the end of the season he learned of the statements made against him , and discussed them with Reverend Jackson : They mean to do me in , Sheldon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have had him hanged from his own yardarm. ' g It was Jackson who foresaw the real danger in the threatened courtmartial : The women , Michael . They 'll prove the most powerful of your enemies . I 've always found the women to be the final arbiters . ' Can I count upon you for support ? ' To the end , but I am worried . '  | You 'll come to San Francisco ? Testify for me ? ' You 're the best captain there 's ever been in the Bering Sea , Russian or American . ' James Cook was up here , you know . ' I did n't include the English . ' So it was agreed that Healy and Jackson would make a united stand against the considerable forces arrayed against the former , but Jackson 's promised testimony did not come to pass , because when the Bear put into Sitka to disembark him , the doughty little clergyman faced a kind of courtmartial of his own , for a special investigator with plenipotentiary powers had been dispatched from Washington to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although he was not thrown into jail this time , it was obvious that he would not be able to go to San Francisco to testify in defense of his friend , for he had to save his own neck . The court-martial of Michael Healy was a solemn , miserable affair . Five senior officers from the nation 's armed services sat in judgment of a popular hero gone sour , and the very newspapers which had inflated his reputation as the savior of the north now seemed to revel in his debasement as a tyrant , a brute , a foul-mouthed rascal and a drunk , but this was understandable , because in the opening days of the trial the evidence against him was devastating . Clean-looking young sailors from the Adam Foster testified , one after another , that whereas they had done nothing wrong , merely tried to protect our ship , as you gentlemen would do , he comes aboard , abuses us , and trices us up . ' They explained in harrowing detail what trice up meant , and one man showed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had cut into his wrists . The marks were vivid . The nails were hammered into Healy 's coffin by Mrs. Danforth Weigle , of the W.C.T.U. , who had long visualized this trial as the triumph of her organization 's fight against alcohol on American ships . A fine-looking woman , with a low , cultured voice and not a crusading harridan at all , she made an impressive witness , for her testimony was brief and to the point : American sailors have for too long been victimized by drunken brutes who have tyrannized their men once they sailed from port and left the protection of courts ashore . No case more savage than that of Captain Michael Healy has come to our attention , and we demand that he be sent to jail for his crimes and dropped from the service of the United States . ' She asked that members of her committee who specialized in legal aspects of the problem be allowed to testify , and these ladies completed the devastating case against the black officer . When the prosecution closed , most observers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stories resembling obituaries appeared in the papers , lamenting this deplorable conclusion to a career which had had its moments of nobility , as when the Bear , on various rescue missions , saved many sailors whose ships were trapped in ice . But traditions of the sea run deep , and when the prosecution rested , a parade of the ordinary seamen whose lives Mike Healy had saved from  | shipwreck came forward to testify in his behalf . Junior officers who had served under him were eager to tell of how his indomitable will had saved the Bear when crushing in the ice pack seemed inevitable . A representative of the Russian Empire told the court of how , when he was stationed in Petropavlovsk , his officers looked to Mike Healy and the Bear as their right arm along the Siberian coast , and there was a moment of terrible drama when a survivor of a shipwreck at Point Hope took the stand : We lost our ship when the ice come in sudden in October . We was nine men made it ashore . The rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies ashore with you ? ' Some . ' How long were you marooned ? ' Till June next year . ' How did you survive ? ' We built lean-tos against the wind . Driftwood . ' I mean eat ? What did you eat ? ' We shot two caribou . We rationed careful . We ate bacon rind , anything . ' Here he paused , looked away from the court , and sought the eyes of his salvation , Mike Healy . Then he come with the Bear . ' Go on . What then ? ' In a very low voice , which did not reach to the back of the room , he said : He knew from lookin ' that in April and May when there were no caribou , no stores , we 'd been forced to eat the bodies of them as died . ' The last words were lost in whisper , and the court asked the sailor to repeat , but a man in the front row of the audience said clearly : They were cannibals , ' and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sailor said : Captain Healy knowed what we 'd done . . . been forced to do , that is . . . and he took us under his wing like we was his children . No sermons , no lectures . I remember exactly what he said : " We are all men of the sea . We plow a fearful furrow . " ' The room was silent as the sailor stepped down , and at that juncture it was clear that the five-man court was not at all as certain of Healy 's guilt as it had been the day before , but he would still have been found guilty of at least certain charges had there not been a commotion at the rear of the court , with the marshal shouting : You ca n't go in there ! ' and a gruff voice responding : We 're goin ' in ! ' and into the proceedings came a six-foot-four mariner with a huge head of snowy white hair and beard , followed by two junior officers and an ordinary seaman . Who are you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court demanded , and the intruder said : Cap'n Emil Schransky , Erebus , out of New Bedford , ' and he said that since maritime matters were under judgment here , he demanded a right to testify . Would your testimony be pertinent ? ' the presiding officer asked , and he replied : It would . ' He was allowed to come forward , and without even looking at his old enemy , he began in a restrained voice : If there is any San Francisco newspaperman present , he 'll be able to verify that for better'n ten years me and Mike Healy , the man on trial , fought each other up and down the Bering  | Sea . He was for the Eskimo , I did n't give a damn . He was against pelagic sealin ' , it was my gold mine . He fought anyone who brought rum or molasses to the Eskimos , I did n't . Year after year I outwitted him because I always had the best ship . Then he got the Bear with its steam engine and defeated me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever invaded his sea again . I said to myself : Schransky , you had the best ship and did what you pleased . Now he has the best ship and he 'll do what he pleases . ' But what did you do ? ' I said : " Let him run the Bering as he likes . The Pacific is a big place . " I left . ' Why did you come here today ? ' Because me and my men read what you were doin ' to Mike Healy . What the people from the Adam Foster whined about . The Adam Foster ! What a pitiful ship . What a ship to bring charges against anybody . My men would n't waste time spittin ' at the Adam Foster , ' and his three associates nodded . And these good women ravin ' about his drinkin ' . What did he do when he finally captured the Erebus ? Dumped all our rum and molasses down the scuppers . Ask the Adam Foster what he did when he captured them . I 'll bet they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Healy was fierce against alcohol for Eskimos . ' He concluded his testimony with a surprising statement : I fought Healy for a decade , and always I had the best ship . But he fought me like a tiger , because he represents the best traditions of the sea . Even a master ship like the Bear is no good unless it has a master like Healy . That damned nigger with his parrot drove me from the arctic seas , and no lesser man could 've done it . And if we went to sea again , we 'd still fight , and the man with the best ship would win . ' From the witness stand he saluted his longtime enemy and retired to the back of the room followed by his men . The judges filed out , returned after the briefest possible consultation , and rendered their verdict : The citizens who lodged charges against Captain Michael Healy did not do so frivolously . His actions must have seemed deplorable to them . But the sea is governed by noble traditions accumulated through centuries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforced by captains like Michael Healy , no ship can sail safely . This court finds him Not Guilty on all charges . ' The audience , divided sixty percent for conviction , forty for acquittal , groaned and cheered while Emil Schransky rose from his seat , uttered a wild yell , and saluted Healy once more . When order was restored , the court continued with its verdict : But since not even the ablest captain can be allowed free rein for intemperate behavior at sea or for abusive language directed against his subordinates , this court must take into account that on three past occasions Captain Healy has received severe reprimands for drunkenness and misconduct , 1872 , 1888 , 189o . We recommend that he be deprived of command for a period of two years . ' But his turbulent life continued . In 1900 , on his first trip after regaining his command , he escaped a most serious court-martial pertaining to his abuse of a woman passenger only when his protectors had him declared  | temporarily insane , and in 1903 , at the conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' unofficerlike and indecent language in the presence of his officers and crew . ' Unrepentant , he moved ashore , and died a year later . In Sitka the government 's case against Sheldon Jackson rehashed old charges against him , but with new and more effective citizens making them . As the population of Alaska grew , the numbers of miners , businessmen and saloonkeepers increased proportionately , and these groups had always been violently anti-Jackson , but since their speakers were now more literate , they painted him in dark and dictatorial colors : He wants to tell everyone how to behave , but he himself is an unchristian , ungodly tyrant . ' He had also acquired a new body of enemies , the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , who felt that if the little missionary wanted to declare war against their church and their language , which he obviously did , they would take up arms against him . Most telling was a voice not heard before , and therefore extra persuasive : If Reverend Jackson spends six months a year attending to personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunken crony on the Bear , how much time per year has he left to mind his duties in Alaska ? ' At the conclusion of this round of testimony , things looked gloomy for Jackson , but the investigator was no fool , and before issuing his conclusions he sought a secret meeting with Carl Caldwell , now a full-fledged judge in the Alaskan court , who confided : Everything his enemies say about Jackson is true . But his enemies say the same thing about me , and if you set up your office here , they 'd lodge the same charges against you . Nobody can be neutral where Jackson is concerned . He often irritates me , and I 'm sure he 'd irritate you . But you must have deduced from the character of his enemies that he 's one of the best forces in Alaska . He represents the future . ' Paralleling the court-martial in San Francisco , the government man in Sitka began by conceding that the charges against Jackson had been brought in good faith , and he said so ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this obstreperous little man , but like Mike Healy , he was necessary for the well-being of his society . So the verdict had to be : All charges dropped with prejudice , ' which meant , as Caldwell explained : They ca n't be revived again . ' But of course that applied only to Alaska , because when Jackson returned to Washington , members of his own church conspired against him , bringing charges of misapplication of funds , disobedience to orders and arrogance in the conduct of his missionary efforts . But his defenders pointed out that while others sat in offices pondering the niceties of formal administration , he had been on the firing line , sleeves rolled up and winning souls to God . His loyal women , seeking to remind the public of his astonishing accomplishments , published a small pamphlet summarizing his work : In unflagging dedication to God 's work from Colorado to Arizona to Montana to Alaska , with yearly returns to Washington to instruct Congress , he traveled more than a million miles using every  | known form of transportation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than seventy congregations , for whom he personally built more than forty church buildings . He often gave four or five speeches in one day for a total that ran into many thousands , and church organizations launched by him collected for missionary and other religious work a proved total of $20,364,475 , for in the work of the Lord he was tireless . We shall not soon again see his like . But perhaps the most revealing portrait of this contentious little man , who continued all his days to make friends and enemies in equal proportion , can be found in his battle with the Post Office Department , of which he was a paid official . It was his belief that since the Great Land was now American , its villages should carry respectable American names , and since he had the right to choose the names , he saw no reason why they should not honor the Presbyterians who had helped civilize the new territory . Accordingly , he dumped fine old Eskimo and Tlingit names and replaced them with ones like Young , Hill , Rankin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good Presbyterians all , the last two being relatives of his whom he wished to honor . One of his most interesting switches was getting rid of Chilkoot , attached to a beautiful village west of Skagway ; for it he substituted Haines , the name of the chairwoman of the Presbyterian Women 's Committee , who had never seen Alaska but who had contributed generously to Jackson 's support . His principal change , however , was to drop the historic old Tlingit name of Howkan in favor of his own , Jackson . This caused a furor , for the residents did not want to lose their historic designation . Jackson , however , was adamant , and pestered Washington to ignore local complaints and retain the new name , which honored him . But when the Democrats assumed national leadership under Grover Cleveland , the Post Office Department restored the name but spelled it Howcan , at which Jackson , with a burst of spleen which proved he had no shame or sense of the ridiculous , deluged Washington with requests that Howcan be changed back to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Republicans rewon the presidency , he sent a sharp letter to John Wanamaker , the new and Presbyterian postmaster general : With the Republicans again in power we expect to receive just consideration . . . . During Cleveland 's administration the Democrats had it changed back to Howkan , out of opposition to myself . With our Republican victory , it became Jackson again . Now I hear there is a local movement to make it Howkan once more . Please notify the clerk in charge of these proposals that you wish it left Jackson , and greatly oblige . But his foes prevailed , and changed the name back to a misspelled Howcan . The two American giants in Alaska , Michael Healy and Sheldon Jackson , were in some ways reminiscent of the two earlier giants Vitus Bering and  | Aleksandr Baranov . In each instance the first of the pair was an imposing sea captain who exerted his will and his command over the northern oceans , while the second member was insignificant or even comic in appearance but gargantuan in determination to forge ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprint on Alaska , especially the second and less imposing members , but the greater similarity seems to be that each of these four explorers and dreamers was a badly flawed man . They were not resplendent conquerors like Alexander the Great or continent builders like Charlemagne . They were ordinary men who drank too much or were foolishly vain or who started things they did not finish or who were objects of ridicule to their colleagues . All four were subjected to official harassment or legal investigations or the censure of court-martial , and each ended his life in a kind of disgrace . Alaska did not produce supermen , but in its formative periods it was served by men of character and determination , and it is a fortunate land which knows such public servants .  | HI : CATACLYSMIC INCIDENTS WHICH PRODUCED THE SCENIC grandeurs of Alaska began at least a hundred and twenty million years ago , but the events which gave rise to the most dramatic development in Alaskan history started much earlier . About eighteen billion years ago , insofar as science can determine from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , and what had previously been a void became occupied by gigantic clouds of cosmic dust . Different men with different insights or mind-sets have described this beginning of the beginning in different ways , but regardless of its cause , the event seems to have set our universe spinning ; all that happened thereafter stemmed from its complexity and overpowering force . We can not reasonably guess what happened to the major portion of the dust thus set in movement , but about nine billion years ago a minor portion  --  staggering in size though only a fraction  --  began to coalesce into what would ultimately become the galaxy of which we are a part . In this galaxy some two hundred billion stars would form , the one we see rising each morning as our sun being one of the smaller . We must not take too much pride in our galaxy , wonderful as it is , because it is merely one of more than a billion ; quite often the others are greater in dimension and larger in their starry populations . About six billion years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began assuming the shape of a huge swirl much like the ones we will see in the heavens this night if we have a good telescope , for all the processes here mentioned are still being repeated in other parts of  | the universe . Out of this swirling mass of cosmic particles a star began to evolve and with it the nine or ten accompanying planets which together would make up our solar system . Our sun , therefore , is probably about six billion years old , with some of the planets slightly younger . Now our figures become more precise . About four and a half billion years ago cosmic dust somehow related to what was happening in the sun began to agglomerate into what would ultimately become our earth . For the first billion years of its existence the earth seems to have been a turbulent cauldron in which violent physical and chemical alterations were taking place . Composed at first mainly of hydrogen and helium , the interior of the earth accumulated such heat and pressure that nuclear reactions occurred , and out of them began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon which the earth would be constructed . Iron , one of the principal elements , being heavier than most , concentrated in the central core , where in a part molten , part solid form it would exert the unifying force which held the earth together , determine much of its movement , establish the magnetic poles , and lend stability to the whole . Mixed with generous amounts of nickel , this central core of iron helped in manifold ways to keep the earth functioning . At the center , in a heat inconceivable , under pressures never known on the surface and driven by nuclear reactions , the semiliquid components of the earth were sorted out , forming all the basic elements which would later comprise the earth as we know it . Essential substances as diverse as lead , sulfur , nitrogen and arsenic emerged , each with its peculiar atomic weight , each with its preassigned and unique position among its neighbors . One of these elements , Number 79 in line with an atomic weight of 196.9 , which made it conspicuously heavy , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of propensities . Gold , far from copious in its distribution throughout the mass of the earth , had a specific gravity nineteen times that of water , so that if any one of the major oceans had been comprised of gold rather than water , its sheer weight could have collapsed the system . A major characteristic of gold was its reluctance to react with other elements , staying stubbornly to itself . In this respect it differed strikingly from the element carbon , which formed relationships with almost any substance with which it came into contact . Carbon formed more than four hundred thousand different compounds , gold almost none . Also , carbon metamorphosed itself into an almost endless chain of useful or valuable products : petroleum , carbon black , anthracite , graphite and limestone . A notable characteristic of carbon was its capacity to restructure itself late in the life of earth , when altered conditions produced altered forms . Thus diamonds , one of the spectacular manifestations of carbon , did not come into being until relatively late , when a unique combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite dazzling . Gold , on the contrary , began as gold , and remained gold , despite the hammering of heat , and atomic reactions , and the ever-present invitation ,  | of other metals to join them in exotic new combinations . Gold tended to associate with the heavier elements related to iron , but it also showed a slight affinity for sulfur . It combined occasionally with the exotic mineral tellurium , but refused to do so with oxygen , the way so many other minerals did . There would be no gold oxide . Gold did not rust . Because of its insularity , gold was known as a noble metal , an adjective applied also to those rare gases which refused to combine with other gases . The word did not refer to lineage , or attractive appearance , or value ; a metal or a gas was noble if it stood by itself , had great persistence and a reluctance to deform itself in union with another element . According to such definitions , gold was certainly a noble metal . It seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocky formations , depositing itself here and there in arbitrary and diverse patterns . At times , like any other liquid under pressure , it found some convenient crevice and spread laterally , coming to rest at various levels , never in great concentrations like lead or sulfur , but in areas so widely scattered that no logical reason could explain their placement . When man succeeded in exploring most of the surface of the earth , he would find deposits of gold in places as varied as Australia , California , South Africa and on the banks of a trivial snowbound stream on the Canada-Alaska border , close to the Arctic Circle . Gold could be found in two dramatically different circumstances . Like other metallic elements , copper and lead for example , it might rest well below the surface of the earth in concentrations laid down millions of years earlier . This gold would be mined , as metals have been mined for some four thousand years , and there would be no great difference between the mining of gold and the mining of the other metals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shored up by timbers ; and at promising levels laterals would be sent out to explore veins . What would be found in such a below-the-surface gold mine ? Not concentrations of the noble metal , waiting to be dug out and brought to the surface . What was common was a quartz rock containing flecks of gold so minute that the unpracticed eye could scarcely recognize them . A find of tremendous value would be a hunk of quartz whose cross section showed traces of gold no larger than pinpoints  --  not pinheads  --  and so widely dispersed that the uninstructed would have to look twice to see them . Such rock , broken loose from its underground hiding places and brought to the surface , would be crushed and sluiced with water , and now the weight of gold became important , for invariably it would sink to the bottom , where it would be trapped in riffles while the apparently heavier but lighter quartz rock was carried off by the water . To mine gold in this way required courage to delve into the earth , dynamite to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water to sluice the crushed mixture . The second way of finding gold was the more exciting . Through millions of years as the upper crust of the earth shifted and rose and fell , veins of rock containing minute traces of gold were exposed to the elements , allowing abrasion to take place . Freezing winters fractured the quartz ; incessantly dripping water broke down the rock ; gravel at the bottom of  | swift-moving streams acted like sandpaper on wood ; and volcanic displacement brought to the surface new deposits to be abraded . As the suddenly released flecks of gold found their freedom , their fate was determined by their weight . They moved for a while with the motion of whatever stream was carrying them , then irresistibly they fell to the bottom , and as they came to rest , certain hydrodynamic forces dictated where they would accumulate . If a stream was tumbling headlong down an incline , they would seem to be almost internally driven to seek some quiet nook in which to escape the turbulence . If a quiet creek was meandering over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into some outer curve where the relative speed of the water slowed . But all the flecks came to rest somewhere . The finding of this surface gold was known as placer mining  --  the word rhymed with gasser  --  and the mark of the placer miner was a man with a beard holding a tin basin beside a creek , panning a load of gravel to see if it showed colors , flecks of gold , then building a crude sluice of some kind to bring lots of water to wash away lots and lots of gravel . To find gold locked in quartz , a man had to dig deep into the earth ; to find placer gold in its easier locations , one sometimes had to dig only two feet and lift up not tons of rocks but only a covering of gravel or sand . Through centuries of gold seeking , men had devised a dozen rules of thumb to guide them in locating where placer gold was hiding , and men who had been on the various gold fields became uncanny in their ability to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field a gang of men practiced in the fields of Australia , California and South Africa , they would find the gold , while amateurs from Idaho , London and Chicago would not . Three practical rules seemed to prevail . The first knowledgeable men on a new field preempted the good spots ; those who arrived late found little or nothing . However , the second rule kept the hopes of the general public alive ; just often enough some lucky prospector who knew nothing about gold stumbled upon colors , scouted about , and by sheer chance staked himself a bonanza . This did not happen often , but it did happen . The third rule was not widely understood , but it accounted for some of the great finds . In seeking placer gold , one followed stream beds , because moving water was the only possible agency by which placers could be deposited . But since the gold had been laid down over millions of years , and since a stream could wander notoriously during even one man 's brief lifetime , what the prospector should investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the mighty one that might have existed a thousand years ago , or a hundred thousand , or even a million . Perhaps , along the Yukon River and its tributaries in 1896 , the place to look for gold was not along the banks of the Klondike , that magical stream with the magical name , but on ridges hundreds of feet high where some river of significance had laid down its gold three hundred thousand years earlier . i . In the summer of 1896 a broken-down American prospector with an unfavorable reputation because of his propensity for lying , George Washington Carmack , happened to strike up an acquaintance with a dour , proper  | Scotsman born in Canada . Robert Henderson could have laid claim to the title gentleman had he preferred , for he favored strict personal behavior and austere business rectitude . Had he no weaknesses ? He was an inveterate snob . The two formed a solid but unlikely partnership , because although each was willing to work hard and undergo privation when seeking gold , there was one difference which superseded all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an Indian woman whose two shiftless brothers , Shookum Jim and Tagish Charley , occasionally helped him in his prospecting . Henderson did not countenance this ; he was honor-bound to share information and potential profits with Carmack , even though Lying George , as he was called , did have an Indian wife , but he could not tolerate the two brothersin-law . Therefore , when Henderson announced that he had made a find on a small tributary to the Thron-diuck River , which debouched into the Yukon , Carmack and his two Indians went over the hills to help him develop his find and share in the profits . But Henderson made things so unpleasant for the Indians , refusing insolently to sell them tobacco , that Carmack decided to reject his share of the claim and strike out on his own . The three men , leaving Henderson to his modest find , climbed over the hills to the west and started their own prospecting on Rabbit Creek , an insignificant tributary to the Thron-diuck . There , on the afternoon of 17 August 1896 , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom gold flakes and nuggets worth four dollars . Since a pan which showed gold worth ten cents was known as an exciting find , Carmack and his brothers-in-law realized that they had struck a bonanza . Hasty additional trials maintained the exhilarating average of four dollars a pan . In the wild excitement , Carmack remembered that he had two obligations to discharge , one moral , one legal . Morally he must inform his partner Henderson of the find , but he was so irritated by the latter 's treatment of the two Indians that he remained on his side of the mountain , leaving Henderson unaware of the stupendous discovery and unable to share in it . Carmack 's legal obligation could not be avoided . When a miner found gold he was required to do two things : file a proper claim with the government and immediately inform other miners as to where his find was and its probable richness , so that they could stake their claims . Carmack , leaving the Indians to guard his rights , sped down the Yukon to the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , and there he staked his title to what would thereafter be known as the Discovery Claim , five hundred feet running along the bank of Rabbit Creek and across it on both flanks to the crest of the first rise . His legal obligations discharged , he then proceeded to the saloon , where he announced at the top of his voice : The biggest strike of all ! ' He also laid claim to three other five-hundred-foot sites : Number One Above , Number One Below and Number Two Below . Carmack , as the principal claimant , was entitled to Discovery and One Below , the other two were for Shookum Jim and Tagish Charley . Henderson 's interest was not protected . The habitues in the little settlement , accustomed to Carmack 's lying  | ways , refused to believe that he had found anything . However , when he produced the empty rifle cartridge in which he kept his largest nuggets and dumped it onto the assayer 's scales , the men 's eyes widened . As prospectors long in the field  --  and meager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen years  --  they were familiar with the qualities of gold peculiar to each site along the Yukon . This came from none of the established mines . It was new gold ; its quality was supreme ; and the size of the nuggets suggested that it came from a major find , not from the weak tail of some small placer . The great gold rush was on ! Before nightfall , hungry prospectors from Fortymile were speeding upriver to stake their claims above and below Carmack 's Discovery . When fresh hordes streamed in they rejected the traditional names of these trivial streams . The Thron-diuck , a name of maximum difficulty which no one could pronounce , was quickly changed to the Klondike . Carmack 's little Rabbit Creek was given the traditional gold-field name Bonanza , while an even smaller contributor  --  which would prove richer than any of the others  --  was appropriately called Eldorado . It was these enchanting names that would flash around the world . Almost every facet of this fabulous stampede , perhaps the largest in history , had its ironic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field . Said a Canadian in a letter home to his wife : We Canadians are resentful of the fact that our fellow countryman Robert Henderson , of Nova Scotia , New Zealand and Australia , has been so badly treated in these gold fields . We are certain that he made the first find and that the disreputable American , the squaw man George Carmack , and his Indian helpers defrauded him of his rightful claim to half their find . However , I must confide to you alone , and do not speak of this to anyone , but I think that maybe Henderson deserved what he got . I heard him say long before the find was made that I do not ( ugly words ) propose to let any ( ugly words ) Indian ( ugly words ) share in my finds of gold . ' We have reason to believe that Carmack 's strike is so wonderfully rich that Henderson 's refusal to work with Indians has lost him more than two million dollars . A second irony of the great discovery on the Klondike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely known along the Yukon , verifiable word of its amazing richness did not reach the Outside until 15 July 1897 . How could information of such a bonanza , to borrow the name of the creek where it happened , be so long concealed ? The Yukon River , 1,993 miles long with much of its course close to the arctic , freezes early , some parts in September , and thaws late , some segments not until June or occasionally July . So for those months , August 1896 till July of the next year , Carmack and his fellow millionaires were frozen in with their secret . But now a determined little Yukon River boat , the  | sternwheeler Alice , of meager draft , forced a passage through the June ice and puffed into Dawson City , the boomtown , which incoming miners from the region had hastily constructed at the mouth of the Klondike . When the crew learned of the tremendous strike and saw the boxes and bundles of gold the lucky prospectors intended taking to the Outside , they quickly unloaded the life-saving fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned their little craft around in hours , loaded it with the new millionaires , and headed downstream to where ocean liners would be waiting near the mouth of the Yukon . As the Alice pulled out of Dawson another sternwheeler arrived , so that all the miners who wished to return to the States found passage . After a journey of nearly fourteen hundred miles , the two little boats reached the Bering Sea , where they turned north to deposit their historic cargo of men and gold at the entrepot of St. Michael . There , after several days of vast dinners consisting of fresh fruit , vegetables and delicious canned foods , heavy in vitamins to fight off the incipient scurvy from which so many suffered , the argonauts with their gold were lightered out to either the Excelsior , bound for San Francisco , or the more famous Portland , for Seattle . As the two steamers approached mainland United States , few passengers could anticipate the storm of publicity they were about to cause , for they assumed that news of their staggering finds must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Canadian officials , who dismissed it as just one more exaggerated report from the Yukon : We know there 's gold up there . Always has been . But never in such amounts . ' Also , a daring dog-team driver had made a heroic trip up the Yukon and across the forbidding Chilkoot Pass to alert American officials stationed in that area , but since these men could not believe the extent of the find , word was not sent south . And a Chicago newspaper received an account from one of its reporters , but since they did not trust him , they printed almost nothing . The Portland achieved immortality by accident , for although she left Alaska first and made the long journey home in less than a month , and although her course was shorter than the Excelsior 's , she did not arrive in Seattle until two days after the latter had already docked in San Francisco . There was , of course , some excitement along the California waterfront , but its newspapers failed to appreciate the magnitude of what had happened at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always eager for spectacular stories , almost ignored the arrival of the gold , and only cursory stories were circulated nationally by rival San Francisco papers , the Call and the Chronicle . However , by the time the laggard Portland pulled into Schwabacher 's Wharf in Seattle on the morning of 17 July , the citizens of that city had already been informed by San Francisco that adventurous men with great hoards of gold were coming home . An imaginative reporter , one Beriah Brown , who deserves to be remembered , had shown ingenuity by going out at dusk in a little boat to intercept the incoming ship and had through the night interviewed its passengers . Preparing his story for that day 's papers ,  | he pondered how most effectively to report this striking story , and he must have considered phrases like a huge amount of gold ' and much gold ' and a treasure trove of gold . ' Discarding them all , he hit upon one of the memorable phrases of American journalism : At 3 o'clock this morning the Steamer Portland from St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a ton of solid gold aboard . Those words , a ton of gold , ' sped across a nation hungry for the metal and seriously in need of it . In banks , in small business houses , in homes where killing mortgages had to be paid off , and in the hearts of men yearning for a more accommodating money system , the words a ton of gold ' became an enchantment , a lure that could not be resisted . How did men react to this thundering bugle call ? In a small Idaho town one John Klope , unmarried and embittered by reverses , heard the summons and cried : At last ! Gold for all ! ' And in a cramped , rickety house in a mean quarter of Chicago , a man whose optimistic father had named him after a President of the United States , Buchanan Venn , was forty years old and disgusted by how sadly his life had deteriorated . Half afraid to voice the revolutionary thoughts which assailed him , he whispered to himself : Dear God ! Perhaps ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not far from the Canadian border , lay the little town of Moose Hide . It was visited by no railroad , for the trans-Canada line ran to the north through Winnipeg and Calgary , while the nearest American road , from Chicago to Seattle , ran to a junction some miles to the south at Bonners Ferry . News came late to Moose Hide , and good news sometimes not at all , so on the eighteenth day of July 1897 , its citizens did not learn from their newspaper , for they had none , of the arrival in Seattle the day previous of a ton of gold . John Klope , a taciturn young man of twenty-seven , remained ignorant of an event which would in due course mean much to him . Klope was the son of an Idaho farmer who had in the race of life kept just a few yards ahead of both the sheriff and president of the small bank in Coeur d'Alene to whom he had mortgaged his farm some years before . In order to help pay off this loan , son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any jobs available , but since these were years when the supply of gold in the United States was severely limited and the circulation of paper money even more so , the Klopes had a difficult time paying off their mortgage . But because they stinted themselves on the luxuries of life and many of the necessities , they succeeded . The farm was now theirs , but it represented not a bountiful life , only the victory of Slavic stubbornness . Incredible as it might seem to others who took pride in their ancestry , John Klope did not know for sure where his ancestors had originated , or what their name had been in the old country . In school his mates had called him that Polack , ' but from something his father said one evening , he judged  | that he was not Polish ; however , the alternative was not spelled out , and he concluded , correctly , that the original Klopes had lived in a territory near the Carpathian Mountains which had changed hands many times . He was satisfied with that status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have clarified the ancestry had he wished , and his mother knew even less about hers . He was John Klope , not a Pole , not a Scandinavian and not a German ? merely an American and happy to be one , like many of his neighbors . In the Klope family one never heard the lament I wish I'd'a stayed in the old country , ' because if vague fragments of memory did adhere to that cliche , they were not pleasant . Klope did not resent the fact that because of poverty he had been denied an education , for he would have had little success in any subjects then being taught , but he did most furiously object to the stranglehold which banks and the money system imposed upon the lives of hardworking families like his , and had he chanced to live in some large city , Chicago or St. Louis , he might well have become radicalized . Sometimes in the evening when the young men of Moose Hide lounged on the street corner after supper , John would listen to those brighter than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he would say nothing , but later , when the discussion had changed to girls , he would suddenly blurt out : The man who has the gold sets the rules . ' In 1893 , when terrible panic gripped the nation and when the freight trains of the Great Northern chugging in to Bonners Ferry carried little cargo , Klope 's preoccupation with gold seemed less arbitrary , for now neighbors who had not paid off their mortgages began to feel the icy sting of the nation 's inadequate money system . Farm after farm was foreclosed , and many young people with whom he had associated when he still attended school had to move away to the slums of cities like Chicago and San Francisco . This painful removal of people had an effect upon Klope that even he did not understand at the time . During his school years he had been vaguely aware of a small , lively farm girl named Elsie Luderstrom ; he had never approached her and certainly he had never walked her home , but he knew that she was kindly inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older he might very well want to speak with Elsie . Before he could do so , her family farm was taken back by the bank and she was whisked away in the silence of the night , as it were , to Omaha . He never saw her again , but with her departure went his chance for a normal life of awkward courtship at nineteen , marriage at twenty-two , children at twenty-four , and the inheritance of either his father 's farm or hers in his thirties . Without his knowing it , Elsie Luderstrom had held the key to his life , and the key had been lost . Banks is what did them in , ' he growled one night as the young men met , and from that solemn judgment , not entirely correct but still relevant , he began to focus upon the need for a man to control his own sources of wealth . A farm was not enough ; what seemed at the moment to be a good job on the Great Northern was not enough ; and even one 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no better men in America than Klope 's father and Elsie 's . They had struggled ; they had saved ; they had been frugal ; and they had been overtaken by this nationwide panic . If there was in all America one young man to whom the call of Klondike gold would seem imperative , it was John Klope . On the afternoon of 20 July 1897 he heard about the strike . A business traveler from Seattle to Chicago had changed trains in Spokane and come up to Bonners Ferry and made the customary joke : Where 's the ferry ? ' and old-timers had explained for the fiftieth time : It used to cross the Kootenai , ' and later the jokester would refer to it as the Hootenanny which runs through Bonners Ferry . ' Many local people would have been just as happy if such travelers stayed home , but this one brought sensational news , for he carried with him newspapers from Seattle , and when people in the rooming house read the headlines and asked if they could have one of the papers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago papers will have the story . ' By afternoon of zo July word had filtered up to Moose Hide , and it so excited John Klope that he dashed in to Bonners Ferry and asked to see the man who had brought the news . When he found him , he asked : They said you had two papers . Could I see one ? ' Here , with my compliments . ' Then he laughed : If you go to the gold fields , good luck . ' On the way home Klope stopped three times to read the article about the ton of gold , and he became so excited that by the time he reached his farm he was prepared to leave immediately for the Klondike . There was nothing to stop him . He was not really needed to run the farm ; his mother and father between them could have managed a place four times the size of their few acres . He was , if the truth were known , a drain on their resources and he knew it . He was not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not prevent the formation of a useful marriage . He had no real friends , and even the young fellows on the corner had begun to think of him as that queer older man . ' He was not only prepared to join the stampede to the Yukon , he was almost impelled to do so . At that time , had Klope been a student of geography , he would have seen that he was already about as close to the Klondike gold fields as he would be if he moved to one of the other starting points like Seattle in Washington or Edmonton in Alberta . In a straight line he was only one thousand three hundred and seventy miles from the Klondike , not much farther than to Chicago , but had he tried to negotiate that distance , he would have found himself entangled in some of the most forbidding terrain in North America . Wisely , he decided , even before he reached home , to approach the Klondike by way of Seattle . When he sat with his parents at supper and showed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digest the amazing story : I 'm heading there tomorrow . ' It was indicative of the Klope family that his father replied simply : I could let you have a hundred and fifty , ' and John said : Added to what I have , it 'll be enough . ' Mrs. Klope did not speak , but she felt it high time her son got out of the house and took steps of his own . John never looked back . He was not able to depart , as he had first said ,  | on the next day , but early on the day after that his father drove him to Bonners Ferry , where they learned that a train would soon be heading south to Spokane and on to Seattle . After an awkward farewell , John said : You better head home , Pop . I 'll be all right . ' And off went the elder Klope , in no way unhappy that his son was making this move . When Klope reached Seattle he found the city in turmoil , for the entire population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wharf , from which steamers were leaving for Alaska , and rarely since the days when nondescript craft plied the Mediterranean had any port seen such an amazing variety of seagoing vessels . There were ocean liners the equal of many crossing the Atlantic , but there were also river tugs hastily fitted out for the relatively quiet Inside Passage to Juneau and Skagway . There were sternwheelers intended for use along the Mississippi and big , rickety sidewheelers which had been used as excursion boats on the placid waters near Seattle . Regardless of what the individual ship looked like , all its space was taken by the time Klope reached the waterfront seeking passage to anywhere in Alaska . In two frustrating days , he found not a single berth available , and since each new train from the east brought fresh hordes like himself , the problem worsened . In his despair at being so close to gold but forestalled from grabbing for it , he asked at the store of the principal outfitters , Ross &; Raglan , where he was purchasing his necessities : How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they told him : We have one ship , the Alacrity , but she 's booked solid through March of next year . ' The clerk , seeing his disappointment and knowing him as a man who spent money freely in buying his gear , said : If you go to the far end of the docks , I believe there 's an old Russian ship being refitted . I forget the name , but anybody out there will show you where she 's berthed . ' And you think she wo n't be sold out ? ' Klope asked , and the clerk said : I doubt it . ' When he found the Russian ship , the Romanov of Sitka , he understood why her tickets had not been at a premium , for she was one of the most extraordinary ships presuming to make the run . Hastily built as a Russian sidewheeler for use in the protected waters of southeast Alaska , she had been purchased by Boston seafarers when Russia abandoned the area in 1867 and after long service in the sealing trade had been brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quieter waters of the bays and inlets . Later she had been fitted with an additional boiler that burned coal and a spasmodic propeller that operated in conjunction with the two sidewheels . It thus had two completely different systems for propulsion and three instruments for shoving itself through the sea : two wooden sidewheels and a slightly bent metal propeller . This ancient ship , leaking at many points but never enough to cause sinking , proposed to make the three-thousand-mile journey through rough open and often turbulent seas to St. Michael , the ocean port where passengers and cargo would transfer to smaller steamers for passage up the Yukon .  | The fare would be one hundred and five dollars for the proposed three-week run , and by the time of departure , every usable spot on the ship would be taken . During a gold rush such a statement did not carry its customary meaning ; it did not mean that all berths were occupied ; it meant that even sleeping room on the deck and in the cargo areas below was filled . A ship which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps fifty passengers would now set forth with one hundred and ninety-three . An irony of the situation was that none of these American passengers spoke of themselves as heading for Alaska . ' It was always We 're off for the Klondike ! ' Alaska was an unknown entity , not yet acknowledged as being part of the United States , and as for the Yukon , that great river which they would have to travel if they sailed in the Romanov , few had ever heard of it , and those who had , supposed it to be Canadian . John Klope , a typical passenger , was stumbling into an area about which he knew nothing . He sailed from Seattle on 27 July 1897 , expecting to reach St. Michael in three weeks , which would have been ample time for one of the big steamers , and from there to move promptly into the Yukon on a smaller boat , landing in the Klondike not later than early September . It was indicative of his attitude toward life that during this sea passage he made friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if some stranger had taken pains to make his acquaintance , he would have responded , but it was not his nature to strike up conversations , share secrets , or form partnerships . He was John Klope , no known ancestry , no special attributes , just a tall , somewhat thin , stoop-shouldered man , clean-shaven , neat in his ways , and content to remain aloof . The Romanov plowed the seas with which she was familiar at a somewhat slower speed than announced ; in fact , she seemed to crawl along , as if her diverse means of propulsion counteracted one another . A well-run modern steamer should have made the three-thousand-mile run in nineteen days , and several did , but the Romanov limped along at a speed which would require at least a month . One passenger familiar with ships spread the report : We 're making no more than ninety miles a day . If we hit bad weather , we could take five weeks . ' When she finally wheezed into St. Michael on 25 August 1897 , three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn the realities of Alaskan travel , because there was no harbor waiting and certainly no wharf . The Romanov , like all other vessels arriving here , had to anchor about a mile offshore and wait till cumbersome barges worked their way out to unload passengers , luggage and freight . And when these barges finally did reach land , they usually stopped some yards from the shore , so that passengers had to wade to safety ; women were sometimes carried on the backs of men who acted as informal stevedores . Ashore , the people of the Romanov encountered a predicament which beset even the newcomers from better ships : there were no riverboats available for the long journey up the Yukon , and it seemed likely that none would arrive on their downward journey in time to make another trip up before the freezing of the river . Impossible ! ' some of the Romanov passengers stormed , but when they  | talked with officials they learned that the mournful situation was true : The Yukon is no ordinary river . It flows north of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different times at different places . ' But not in September ! ' Especially in September , in some places . And if it freezes anywhere , it halts all traffic . . . obviously . ' When does it thaw in spring ? ' May , if we 're lucky . More likely June . Last year , early July . ' My God , it 's only open . . . what ? Three months ? ' Three and a half , if we 're lucky . ' How often are you lucky ? ' Not very often . ' Now an icy blast seemed to play upon the horde of gold seekers stranded at St. Michael . The weather was still comfortably warm , but threatening ice seemed to be moving closer , and when Klope heard that the Romanov was heading straight back to Seattle lest it be trapped in arctic ice drifting down into the Bering Sea , he asked : You mean , the whole sea out there freezes ? ' and the locals said : Sure does . If a captain ai n't spry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in October . ' What 's he do ? ' Well , if he 's lucky , he stays pinned there for nine months , right offshore where we can see him . If he 's unlucky , ice keeps coming at him , crushes his ship and turns it into kindling , like over there . ' And when , along the bleak , treeless shore , Klope saw the remnants of various large ships which had been destroyed by the impersonal , pounding ice , he became obsessed with a determination to get out of St. Michael and up the Yukon before the ice trapped him too , but he found not a single riverboat available for the trip ; three departed while he searched , but since each was crammed with men standing along the rails , not another passenger could be accommodated . When it looked as if the Romanov people would be stranded in St. Michael , a town of less than two hundred , mostly Eskimo , Klope heard of a certain Captain Grimm , a boatowner familiar with the Yukon , who had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water if a boatload of passengers would pay in advance so that he might in turn pay for boiler repairs which his old sternwheeler simply had to have before it could move a foot . At first Klope was doubtful about such a transaction , for he suspected that the name Grimm depicted the captain 's character : He 's probably just another banker wearing a different suit , but when no alternative appeared , he was forced to consider Grimm 's offer . As usual , he found it difficult to discuss anything with anybody , but fortunately , there were other would-be passengers willing to assume that chore , and an outgoing young man from California with mining experience moved through the small community asking pertinent questions , then reporting to the stranded gold seekers : Everybody says Grimm has a good reputation . And he really does need money . His boat ca n't sail unless it has a working boiler . ' With this provisional information , the passengers encouraged the miner ,  | whom everyone called California , to pursue his investigations , and this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the best captain sailing the Yukon . Knows every twist and turn . And they say that when you 're on the Yukon , the twists and especially the turns become important . ' No vote was taken , but by general acclaim the castaways agreed to provide Captain Grimm with the funds he needed , and Klope was assigned to see that the money was spent only on repairs . He helped the three skilled Eskimos employed by Grimm , and in sixteen days they completed a job of extensive overhaul . On 13 September the river steamer Jos . Parker , Captain Grimm , pulled out of St. Michael with sixty-three fully paid passengers when it would ordinarily have carried thirty-two . Baggage and stores were so plentiful that temporary wooden sides had to be erected around the foredeck , and atop this cargo half the men would sleep . From St. Michael to the mouth of the Yukon was seventy miles over the open Bering Sea , and night fell and the next dawn arrived before the little craft reached the amazing delta of the Yukon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river existed ; there were some forty mouths emptying into the sea over a distance of almost a hundred miles . The trick , ' said Captain Grimm as he maneuvered his boat , is to find the right one , ' and the passengers stood amazed as he picked his way through this tangle of swampland and tributaries and dead-end channels . At last he came upon the one channel in these parts that would enable him to move upstream toward the gold fields . The Yukon had several peculiarities . It rose far to the south in mountains less than thirty miles from access to the Inside Passage , but instead of joining the sea there , it chose to travel one thousand nine hundred and seventy-nine miles before entering the icy waters of the Bering Sea . It started north like all the other great rivers of the arctic  --  Ob , Yenisei , Lena and Kolyma in Siberia , and Mackenzie , greatest of all , in Canada  --  but unlike them , it did not empty into the Arctic Ocean or its subsidiaries , for after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow afraid of the frozen north . Turning sharply westward , it fled the arctic and wandered sometimes almost aimlessly toward the Bering Sea . A major peculiarity was that for much of its distance it was a braided river  --  that is , it broke into many strands which meandered here and there , so that at some points there was not one Yukon but twenty , or even thirty  --  and only a good ship captain or an Indian long familiar with the river could pick his way in and out . The chance that a stranger could navigate the Yukon when it became braided was minimal . It was this formidable river that Captain Grimm in his Jos . Parker proposed to battle , always against the current , for thirteen hundred and fifty-five increasingly cold miles . Since the Parker could make about eighty miles a day , if it could take aboard enough cords of wood along the way , the trip should require some seventeen days , but when the little boat reached Nulato , where the Russians had prospered , they ran into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure to be prolonged .  | As the Parker drew to shore where the old palisade had stood , Captain Grimm saw to his satisfaction that some nineteen cords of neatly cut wood , 4 X 4 X 8 , awaited him , enough , as he told passengers nearby to get us to Chicago if the Yukon ran that way . . . which one of these days it might ... if it took it into its head . ' But when he tried to purchase the needed fuel , he was informed that most of the piles had been preempted for riverboats belonging to the Alaska Commercial Company of Seattle , while the rest had been spoken for by boats of Ross &; Raglan of the same city . Ca n't I get even one cord ? To carry us to the next depot ? ' All bespoken . ' Can I hire someone to cut wood for us ? ' All engaged . ' When it became obvious that the only way the passengers aboard the Jos . Parker were going to reach Dawson before the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , parties were arranged and men fanned out across the barren countryside to find what trees they could , and after a four-day delay , the boat continued upstream , but at the next depot it was the same story , and this time when Klope left the boat with his ax he grumbled : I did n't think I 'd have to chop my way to the Klondike . ' But chop he did as the projected quick trip to the gold fields was agonizingly prolonged . As September waned , the man called California raised the question : At this rate , can we possibly reach Dawson before the river freezes ? ' But when he and a man known as Montana broached the subject with Captain Grimm , the latter gave his reassuring smile and said : That 's my job . ' The attention of the worried passengers was distracted by the fact that they were about to enter the notorious Yukon Flats , a desolate and almost frightening area one hundred and eighty miles long in which the Yukon became hopelessly braided , as if some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area was seventy miles wide , reaching out from both banks , it covered more than twelve thousand six hundred square miles and was about six times the area of Connecticut . On first acquaintance it had not one redeeming feature : few trees , no surrounding mountains , no swift-moving streams , no villages clinging to the banks , merely an endless expanse of swampland , the overpowering Yukon Flats . John Klope , as a farmer who knew good land when he saw it , was appalled . But those familiar with the Flats developed an affection for them ; here birds thrived in numbers unimaginable , and hunters from North Dakota to Mexico City were indebted to the summer breeding grounds thus provided for game birds which could have flourished nowhere else . Geese and ducks abounded . Wild animals of the most valuable kind proliferated : martin and mink and ermine and lynx and fox and muskrat and others whose names Klope would not have recognized . Larger game lived here , too : moose with enormous horns , caribou in winter , bears along the edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Flats was the innumerable lakes , some little larger than a table , others as big as normal counties . At one spot the Yukon itself  | broadened into a lake of tremendous size , and occasionally fifty or sixty lakes would be linked together by minute streams , forming a chain of jewels resplendent in the cold sunlight . How many lakes were there in the Flats ? An explorer who had traveled the two major rivers which joined the Yukon here  --  Chandalar to the west , Porcupine coming in after a very long ramble through Canada  --  estimated that the area as a whole must contain at least thirty thousand independent clearly defined lakes : What amazed me most , as I reflect upon it , was the excessive number of oxbows , those almost circular streams cut off from any main body of water , no entry , no exit , proof that in times past a meander had been eliminated when a flood altered the course of some little stream . ' Riverboat captains had a less enthusiastic opinion of the Flats , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the braids , you can travel for a day before you find yourself at a dead end . Then you waste another retracing your way back to the main channel , supposing you can find it . ' On 1 October 1897 , Captain Grimm apparently lost his way in one of these landlocked braids , for after stumbling about during most of a long , cold morning , he confessed to his passengers : We seem to be lost , ' and they knew that they were still fifty miles short of Fort Yukon , which they had to reach in order to obtain the next load of wood . Some men grumbled , and when Grimm decided to stay where he was and spend the night against the shore rather than retrace his course , two men came close to threatening him , but others provided sager counsel and no threats were voiced . During the argument Klope took neither side , for although he desperately wanted to reach the gold fields , he suspected that Captain Grimm knew what he was doing . It was extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wakened by Montana , who was shouting about what was happening in their cul-de-sac : Look at those fingers of ice ! ' And when Klope reached the railing , he could see delicate probes reaching out from shore as the colder water there began to freeze . Few travelers had ever had an opportunity to watch a great river actually freeze , and although the braid in which the Parker was trapped was not part of the main current , the process was the same . While the middle of the river remained free , with no indication that it was about to freeze , thin ice did form at a few spots where the water touched land , but for the moment these isolated incidents indicated little , for they were not extensive nor did they reach far enough into the river to constitute any menace . No man could have walked upon the fragile ice thus formed . But as Klope watched , a miracle occurred , for without warning of any kind , no cracking or popping , an entire stretch along the shore suddenly congealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the watchers grew apprehensive , and at a spot well ahead of the Parker , that is , up near the closed end of the braid , they saw a second miracle , this one of greater import , for as the icy fingers coming out from land grew more sturdy , they suddenly leaped outward from each shore , joining in the middle of the braid as if forming a congratulatory handclasp ,  | and in that instant , that part of the Yukon was frozen . The process was mysterious , quick and beautiful . By afternoon , with the temperature far below zero , ice began to move out from the waterline of the Parker , and Klope stood with California as its fingers groped for those reaching out from shore , but night fell before they could witness completion of the jointure . By next morning , 3 October , most of the Flats were frozen shut and even the mighty river was sending out preliminary fingers . By nightfall this section of the Yukon would be closed to navigation . That 's why I ran in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you at the time , because you would n't have believed the river could freeze so swiftly . If we 'd tried to finish the run to Fort Yukon , we 'd have been locked in the big ice and most likely been crushed when it moved . ' How long will we be trapped here ? ' California asked , and Grimm said : Till June . ' Oh my God ! ' Montana cried , and Grimm said : We 're only one of many . Take heart . I 've chosen one of the safest spots on this river . Less wind . No fear of creeping ice . ' In a good winter the Parker might have provided a comfortable eightmonth refuge for perhaps thirty men ; any hope of keeping sixty-three content was impossible , and before that day was out some men were demanding refunds of their money . With his beard jutting out , his feet firmly placed , his eyes atwinkle , Olaf Grimm lined out the simple truth : I undertook to get you to Dawson . I did n't promise when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find what trees there are and bring us some wood , because if you do n't we 'll freeze to death , and I 'll do my share of the chopping . ' He explained where the privies would be built , and any man not using them will be shot . ' He asked for volunteers to hunt for moose and caribou , and you must go out right now to catch what you can before the heavy snows . ' As this resolute man spoke he conveyed the impression that he had faced such situations before and intended to see that his passengers survived this one . He was conciliatory ; he sympathized with men who were sorely disappointed ; but he allowed no excuses , gave no exemptions from the work that he knew had to be done . When California complained , with reason : If you knew we were going to freeze in , why did you leave St. Michael ? ' he said truthfully : Because you people wanted to come . And we 'd have made it on schedule if we 'd been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter eleven river craft were imprisoned in ice . None handled the situation better than the Jos . Parker , and when one of the passengers returned to the boat with news that he had killed a moose , he accepted the praise due him , then asked : Ever since I 've been aboard this damned ship I 've wondered why it was called the Jos . Parker . Comin ' back just now , I understood . The name-board ai n't big enough for a full first name . ' That 's right , ' Grimm said , thankful for any diversion . Named after the father of the man who built it . Josiah Parker . Nice trim name , I always thought . '  | On 4 October , John Klope , still burning to get to the gold fields , spoke with Captain Grimm : Living like this has got to get worse and worse , ' and Grimm said : Yes . ' Could I walk to Fort Yukon ? ' Fifty miles . Rough sledding . Take you maybe three , four days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Sure is . ' The veteran hesitated , for he would not want it said later that he had encouraged men who had started up the river under his care to leave their boat at the beginning of an arctic winter . At other ships other captains were facing the same moral problem ; from one ship a lone man with dogs would set out for a journey of twelve hundred and fifty miles and make it . From another , a man who liked to paint watercolors would go three hundred yards and freeze to death . Captain Grimm said , very carefully : You and I , Klope , could make it . I 've watched you . You 're disciplined . But I would n't want to try it with some of those others . And do n't you . Stay here and live . ' It was a masterful statement , a warning not to leave the safety of the Parker but at the same time a challenge , and Klope , ignoring the former , embraced the latter . When it was learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven other men volunteered , and in some cases demanded , to go along , and suddenly he found himself the leader of an expedition . The idea terrified him , because although he had no fear about succeeding on his own , he doubted that he could hold a disparate group of men together if they ran into trouble , nor did he want to . Cleverly , he handed the management of the expedition over to loud-spoken California , who enjoyed giving directions , and justifying Klope 's decision , California proved to be resourceful and a good leader , although to Klope 's taste , a trifle domineering . Well bundled , the twelve who wanted to get to Fort Yukon bade farewell to the ice-locked Jos . Parker early on the morning of 5 October , expecting to cover no less than thirteen miles a day , which would put them safely in Fort Yukon on the late afternoon of the eighth , and since darkness did not come till about five-thirty , they assumed they would have ample light . What they did not anticipate was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Yukon did not freeze flat and smooth like the lakes some of them had known in the States ; because it froze in arbitrary ways at sharply varying times , its surface was uneven , crumbled at times , and broken by irregular upthrust blocks . California , distraught by the impediments thrown up by the Yukon , shouted : What in hell happened to this river ? ' and Montana explained what was obvious to an outdoorsman : It freezes here but not there . Free water floods in , covers the frozen ice and freezes . Then more free water comes in below , everything buckles . ' He assured California that a level route could be found through the ice chunks , but the latter had had enough . Kicking at the blocks , he growled : Let 's get away from this damned river . ' But when he led his team away , he soon faced the myriad lakes and the frozen swamps between . This tundra was dotted with large , round tufts of matted grass called by everyone in Alaska niggerheads . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs high to step from low ground to high ,  | and then take longer strides than usual to reach the next niggerhead . It was painful going . By alternating between the jagged ice of the river and the uneven surface of the frozen swamp , the informal expedition moved at a painful pace that would cover not thirteen miles a day as planned , but no more than eight . The trip would thus require not four days but six , and since the men had geared themselves to an easy four-day dash over the kind of snowy roads they had known in states like the Dakotas and Montana , they were disheartened . Fortunately , the cold was not yet excessive , and no wind blew , so that even the weakest of the men did not suffer , and when night came they were not so exhausted that they were unable to care for themselves , but they were thoroughly tired . It had been planned that they would sleep with snow piled about them like a blanket , for this would deflect the wind and allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparingly , for they had brought along only enough food for the projected four days , but as California said : Short rations wo n't hurt anyone . And we 'll soon be there . ' The first night 's rest was brief , for the men found it difficult to sleep in their snow beds , and while no one suffered from a lack of clothing , no one was properly clothed , either , for such exposure . As soon as dawn began to show , about six-thirty , the men were eager to resume their march , and with a day 's practice behind them , they handled the difficult terrains more adeptly . But if California led them onto the river , they wanted to wander among the lakes , and if he acceded to that suggestion , they rather quickly asked for the river . At dawn some had predicted : Yesterday was learning . Today we 'll do fifteen miles , ' but they covered barely half that distance . Klope slept soundly that second night . He had seen that when neither he nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he stayed in front most of the time , yielding only when Montana saw that he was tiring . The two men never spoke of what they were doing or of their growing suspicion that some of them were not going to make it to Fort Yukon . On the night of the fourth frustrating day , when three of the men became almost too weak to lift their legs high enough to negotiate the niggerheads , it was apparent to Klope that emergency measures must be taken , and he consulted with both California and Montana . The latter said : We got to put someone at the rear . Else we 're gon na lose somebody back there . ' They can see our trail , ' California said , but Montana would not accept this easy answer : Trouble is , in this weather the man at the end says : ' I ' 11 lie down for just a minute , " and you never see him again . Frozen solid . ' Klope volunteered to walk last , and it was fortunate that he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lag dangerously , and he spent a trying day urging them to keep moving forward . Twice the major file forged so far ahead that he had to shout at the top of his voice to make them slow down until his three flagging charges could catch up . By nightfall two others had fallen behind , and when California , whose courage and determination helped keep the men together , consulted with his two assistants , Klope reported : I 'm not sure I can make them keep up for another day , ' and to make things worse , that night the temperature fell precipitously.  | Shortly after midnight California shook those still sleeping in the protection of the snow : Better start moving , men , ' and in the shadowy light of a waning moon they started what they would later remember as the worst night and day of their lives . That sixth day they elected to stay with the river , picking their way slowly past protruding blocks , and at times John Klope , bringing up the rear , thought that the silent figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket , but such poetic comparisons were banished when one of the laggards simply fell in a heap , unable to respond to Klope 's commands that he rise . When helpers hurried back , they found to their horror that the man had not fainted ; he had died . Yes , on the Yukon River some miles below the safety of the Fort , a bank clerk from Arkansas had died of exhaustion , and after his body had been placed under a blanket of snow , a subdued and sometimes terrified group of eleven resumed its slow march forward . Klope was not unduly distressed by the death . He was aware that men died in arbitrary ways ; on a neighboring farm a man he knew well had been strangled when the reins of a rearing horse caught around his neck , and once during a visit to Bonners Ferry he had heard men shouting at the railroad station , where a workman had been crushed between two boxcars . So he could absorb the shock of death . But when the party halted at noon for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . California , seeking to dispel the gloom attendant upon the death , was giving encouragement : It was fifty miles in all , and I calculate we 've covered forty-two , ' when a man from Ohio said : I heard Captain Grimm say : " It 's only fifty or sixty miles to Fort Yukon . " ' The possible addition of ten miles to what was already a hellish journey terrified Klope , for as rear man he had witnessed better than anyone else the utter exhaustion of the weakest members . When California and three other strong men moved apart to discuss the situation , Klope was impressed by the forthright manner in which the leader conducted himself : I want the four of us to pledge that we will not forge on ahead and forget the others . We 'll stay with these men and get them to Fort Yukon . ' But what if the time comes when one of us has to rush ahead , ' Montana asked , to bring help ? ' You three can draw straws . I 'll stay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , and California snapped : No . ' That afternoon the temperature dropped to ten degrees below , but mercifully no wind accompanied the fall ; however , another man walking not far ahead of Klope collapsed and died , not instantly like the first , but in terrible , rasping pain over a period of forty minutes . Klope buried him , and then the real horror of this forlorn journey began , because the Yukon became excessively humpy while the swamps were barricaded by niggerheads that were barely negotiable . At half past four what arctic daylight there was would begin to fade , and the men would face the punishment of a long , bitterly cold night without adequate protection . Klope did not lose courage ; he could never do that so long as the lure of gold pulled him forward , but as he estimated the waning strength of the  | laggards , he realized with deepening concern that as many as three could perish during the coming hours , and he called for the other strong marchers to join him . What shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep moving ahead . All night . Otherwise we could all die . ' And if those over there . . . ? ' California studied Klope 's forlorn group sitting numbly in the snow , either unaware of or indifferent to the fact that their lives were under discussion , then said : Keep them going as long as possible . If they die , do n't stop to bury them . ' And he returned to the lead , where he spurred the marchers on . It was almost dusk on that terrible day when one of the weakest men espied an amazing sight , which he called to Klope 's attention : Dog team ! ' And there to the north , picking his way carefully through the frozen swamps of the Yukon Flats and obviously headed toward Fort Yukon , came a man running behind a sled drawn by seven large , powerful dogs . He was dressed in Eskimo garb , his exposed face surrounded by the fur-lined hood of a parka , his body so swathed in heavy garments that he looked almost round . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a chance that he might speed by without stopping , so with a wild shout Klope started running northeast in hopes of intercepting him . The other men , hearing the shouts , turned and saw the speeding dogsled , and without a moment 's hesitation California began running too , and because he started from a better angle , it was he whom the sled-driver finally saw . Commanding his huskies to halt , he came forward to meet these strangers , and a moment 's glance at the weary file whose men had taken rest in the snow satisfied the man that he had come upon a party of cheechakos in peril . He was Sarqaq , half Eskimo , half Athapascan Indian , and he ran a dogsled out of Fort Yukon . He spoke little English but understood many words , and when he asked California : Fort Yukon ? ' he comprehended the answer . How far ? ' California asked , and he said , holding up one finger : ' Tomorrow . ' But then California asked : Your tomorrow or our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solved the problem by putting his hand on one of the dogs , a handsome white-faced animal fifth in line from the lead , and with his fingers imitated the four swiftly moving legs of a dog . Then , using his own feet , he plodded slowly forward : Dog one day ? Man how many ? ' Sarqaq , whose brown face was as round as if it had been drawn with a compass , laughed , showing white teeth : I now . You tomorrow . ' Klope was in no way a religious man , but he sighed : Thank God . ' He and California and the others in strong condition could certainly survive till tomorrow night ; the weakest could perhaps be taken to warm beds by the dogsled . Taking the driver by the arm , he pointed to the resting men : Two , three . Maybe die , ' and with sign language he indicated men dying from lack of will . Sarqaq understood immediately , and without even a minute 's hesitation knew what he must do . Furiously he started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat he was delivering to Fort Yukon , and when it  | became apparent that he was unloading cargo to provide space to transport the threatened men , Klope said : I go get , ' but Sarqaq stopped him : I go , ' and with curt commands he swung his dogs about , sped to the line of men , who uttered feeble cheers , and asked : Who go ? ' holding up three fingers taken from the mitten which protected them from freezing . The men waited for Klope to identify the three worst cases , and when he had done so , these men , barely aware of what was happening , were loaded aboard the sled . Then came a moment of the most painful indecision , for the seven men left behind could not anticipate what might happen . Were these three alone to be saved ? Was Fort Yukon really only one day away ? Could they survive any more nights in this dreadful cold ? Sarqaq , anticipating their fears , smiled like a rising moon and said to Klope : Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Parker he said : Cut meat . Chew it . Wrap in furs . I come back . Many sleds . ' And off through the darkening night he sped . It was about four in the morning when one of the travelers , who was moving about to keep himself alive , heard from the east the sound of dogs . Listening for confirmation lest he deceive his companions , he heard the unmistakable sound of men cheering on their teams , and he began shouting : They 're here ! They 've come back ! ' From wherever they had been sleeping and in whatever postures , the survivors leaped to their feet and peered into the moonlit night . Slowly , like the vision in a narcotic dream , dogsleds began to appear upon the Yukon , with the figures of men running behind , and as they became reality the freezing men began to scream and shout Hurrah ! ' and weep . In 1897 , Fort Yukon was no longer a fort , but when erected half a century earlier , it had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrepid English explorer Frederick Whymper , in 1867 , still showed the imposing four blockhouses , inside whose square nestled several homes , and two enormous barns for the storage of furs being bought and merchandise being sold by the Hudson 's Bay Company , whose daring traders had established this most remote of their outposts . In 1869 , Fort Yukon provided an outstanding example of why Canada and the United States were such good and sensible neighbors : that was the year when young Otis Peacock and his army team proved that the Canadian Hudson 's Bay Store was far inside American territory . Instead of raising a ruckus , American and Canadians had diplomatically moved the store ? twice , because after the first move , it was still trespassing on American soil . For some years Fort Yukon had been a thriving little settlement of about a hundred and ninety people who earned a modest living by collecting furs from Indians and by servicing the occasional riverboat like the Jos . Parker when one stopped by , but with the discovery of Klondike gold , the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarqaq , as he was called despite his part-Athapascan blood , and the other sled drivers delivered the ten white men to the Fort , a curious situation developed . California , the man who more than any other  | had been responsible for keeping the travelers moving forward , suddenly lost his nerve , and when a third man died at the Fort , he took the blame upon himself . For three days he sat in a stupor , overwhelmed by the tragedy in which he had participated . Klope and others told him : You kept us going , ' but he could not accept this ; he felt compelled to take responsibility for the deaths of his three companions and the near-deaths of the others . Klope was not being honest when he said that it had been California who had saved the expedition . Both he and Montana knew that they , too , had held the team together and that many more would have died had not Klope refused to let them do so . But he sought no accolade for having done what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescuer , Sarqaq , and spent hours with the Eskimo 's ten dogs . Sarqaq was known as an Eskimo because that was an easier identification than half Eskimo , half Athapascan ; besides , he looked like a prototypical Eskimo , with stocky build , round face and pronounced Oriental features . He was an amiable man , much given to grinning , which made his face shine like a full moon , and he enjoyed having Klope take an interest in his dogs . He maintained ten , even though he preferred to use only seven on his sled ; the extra three would be fed into the team as present members aged or grew refractory . For example , he had not much use for the dog that Klope had liked in those first moments of their meeting in the Flats , number five in line . By some instinct , Klope had identified the one dog that was not a pure husky , as if he had spotted some variation in character . Not husky , ' Sarqaq said . Maybe half-half . ' A white man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of Breed , indicating a mixed heritage , and when Klope heard that the dog was mixed , he supposed that this accounted for the difference he had noted . Breed looked like a husky ; he had the white mask , the extremely dark hair edging his eartips , the heavy coat and the powerful front legs . His eyes were framed in white and he also had a thin white stripe down the middle of his forehead . His body was a brownish gray and his whole attitude one of alertness . His weakness was that he did not fit in with the other dogs , and if he did not mend his ways and quickly , Sarqaq would have to replace him , because one difficult dog could ruin a team . As Klope spent these October days with the dogs , he slowly acquired an understanding of these remarkable animals , so unlike the ones he had known in Idaho . The most important beast in a team was the lead dog , and Sarqaq 's was almost unbelievable in its intelligence and its love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable . It was the lead dog who disciplined the others , who threw its total weight into the straps , who kept the sled always moving forward and who designated the track . It was responsive to Sarqaq 's commands and even anticipated them , and although it could not be said that it loved its master , for it stayed aloof from humans , it obviously did love the job of leading the team and protecting the heavy sled they drew . Dog number two in line was known as the swing , and it was its responsibility to transfer the leader 's decisions to the dogs behind . Often when the lead dog died or became too old for continued service , the swing took over ;  | in the case of Sarqaq 's team , this would not occur , because although his swing was admirably suited to that job , it would not make a good leader ; it was too amenable to suggestion . Of an importance almost equal to the lead dog was the last in line , the wheel dog , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other dogs did not imperil either the safety or the progress of the sled . A knowing wheel could be worth the whole remainder of the team if it saw to it that their considerable efforts were properly applied to the moving sled , and Sarqaq had about the best wheel in the business . That accounted for the three principal dogs ; the others were lumped together as the team , and sometimes it seemed as if they did the hard work . Each dog had a name , but since these names were in some native dialect , Klope did not master any but Breed 's . He was not an impressive dog when the sled was in motion , and when on three occasions Sarqaq allowed Klope to accompany him on short trips into the countryside , John saw that Breed lacked that strange mixture of respect for discipline and determination to pull regardless of sled weight which characterized the outstanding dogs . Breed was something else , a fierce animal yet one that seemed to crave human companionship , and in John Klope he found a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to whom human associations did not come easily or warmly was developing a powerful affection for this dog . He was therefore dismayed when , after a poor performance by Breed which caused the lines to tangle , Sarqaq said in disgust : No good dog . Maybe shoot . ' Wait ! ' Klope pleaded , but that night when they were back at the Fort , another dogsled man who spoke fairly good English explained : Husky , malamute same . Good only for hauling sled . No good for that , get rid of them . ' But would you shoot one of your own dogs ? ' No good , maybe better shoot . Dog 's whole life , to be in traces , pulling . Lose that job , maybe dog want to be shot . ' Would n't you keep it . . . as a pet ? ' The driver , an Athapascan , laughed and called to two other drivers : He asks husky sled dog a pet ? ' And the men roared with delight at this further proof that Outsiders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Klope spent more time with Breed , and with each passing experience he saw in him an animal capable of enormous affection and willing to share all experiences with this man who had taken an interest in him . Now when Klope came to where the dogs were tied overnight  --  for had they been allowed to run wild , they all might have disappeared  --  Breed strained at his link chain to reach him , and when Klope moved close the dog leaped upon him , and pawed him and tried to lick his bearded face . But such behavior intensified Sarqaq 's belief that Breed had no place in an orderly string of working dogs . It became unthinkable to Klope that such an animal should be destroyed merely because it did not serve obediently the whims of some man , and several times he tried to broach the matter with Sarqaq , who dismissed the subject almost scornfully.  | As the survivors from the Jos . Parker recovered from their ordeal on the Yukon Flats and their courage returned , some started to think of trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort Yukon dissuaded them : That 's more'n three hundred miles . And it 'll be bitter cold now . You fellers lost three men comin ' only fifty miles , in what we call good weather . ' But if we wait till this damned river thaws , all the good claims will be taken . ' We wait every year , ' the Fort Yukon men said . And besides , young feller , all the good claims was taken two years ago . You got plenty time to claim on nothin ' land , so stay here where there 's a hot stove and somethin ' to eat . ' Such advice became more relevant when a dogsled driven by two Indians straggled in from the south with a horror story : Starvation in Dawson . People ordered to leave by the Mounted Police . They reached Circle City , pitiful condition . Frozen toes had to be cut off . Fingers gone . One man lost a leg . ' This portrait of conditions in the south so discouraged the Parker men that any thought of trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible was discarded . That is , it was discarded by everyone except John Klope , who was still tormented by his gnawing mania to get to where the gold lay hiding . Each new hardship made him more determined to ignore difficulties , so that when the fugitives from Circle asked the authorities at the Fort whether a rescue mission of any kind could be mounted to get food to those trapped there and in Dawson , he said without hesitation : ' I ' 11 go , ' and the Indians laughed . They had meant : Is there any local dogsled man who will attempt it ? ' They said that the trip north had exhausted both them and their dogs ; they had no intention of volunteering . Two days after the request circulated , Sarqaq came to Klope : You say you go ? ' Yes . ' You , me , maybe ? ' When Klope jumped at the invitation , the Eskimo asked : You pay ? ' and now Klope had to think . Carefully he explained that he had already paid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jos . Parker , and with signs he indicated that if he , Klope , wanted to stay in Fort Yukon till the river thawed , the Parker would be obliged to carry him to Dawson for no extra payment . The explanation was painfully drawn out , but finally Sarqaq understood that Klope would not pay , and there the matter rested for two days . But on the third day , just as gold-hungry Klope was about to volunteer a limited fee for the trip , Sarqaq returned with his own proposition : the two men would load their sled with all the food that Fort Yukon could spare ; they would hurry it to Dawson ; and there they would sell it for a profit . There seemed to be no risk in such a venture : Sarqaq was certain his dogs could make the trip ; he knew that he could and he suspected that Klope was the kind of white man who had just as much endurance as any Eskimo ; and both men trusted that if they could get the food to Dawson , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . All was set , except for one detail : Klope would have to buy the food from p 391 the commissary at Fort Yukon , and he would have to pay cash , relying upon the successful termination of the rescue mission for repayment . He considered this for several days , for unlike Sarqaq he could visualize many reasons why such a daring venture might fail , but in the end he was so determined to reach the gold fields before the rest of that year 's crowd that he agreed to put up the money . On 20 November 1897 it was known throughout Fort Yukon that Sarqaq and the American were going to attempt the dash to Dawson , three hundred and twenty miles to the south over trails that were frozen deep and covered with snow , along a river that was filled with block ice . If they made twenty-five miles a day , they felt they could cover the distance , with rests for the dogs , in eighteen days , which would put them on the Klondike well before Christmas . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men . Klope went to California , whom he admired , and said : You want to come along ? You were the best man on the other trip . ' But the man who had proved so valiant on the venture from the Jos . Parker had not yet regained his courage , or , more kindly , he had spent it all on that disastrous expedition when only his will power had prevented it from ending in total horror . Now he could do no more than shudder when Klope suggested a repetition . Drawing in his shoulders as if to prevent Klope from getting at his vitals , he shook his head . He had seen the Yukon in autumn and he could not imagine it in winter . When Klope warned , The gold fields will be all taken , ' he looked up in amazement , asking : Gold fields ? ' When the Yukon thawed he intended catching a boat downstream for St. Michael and Seattle ; under no circumstance would he go upstream toward Dawson , either in the spring when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only when Klope saw the terror with which the invitation was rejected did he acknowledge to himself the dangerous trip he was about to undertake . Sarqaq heard a more frightening story . The two drivers who had reached Fort Yukon with news of starvation in Dawson related what had happened when a boat tried to rush supplies to that beleaguered town : Boat got lots of wood for burnin ' , extra food . Good captain , good Indian pilot through the channels . Everything good . If reach Dawson , save many people . ' What happened ? ' Sarqaq asked , and the informant said : Him , me , we reach Circle one day before boat . No food there , no medicine . One hell of a time , I tell you . ' At this point he looked to his fellow driver for confirmation , and the man nodded . Next day many cheers . Boat come in . But captain say : " This food for Dawson . People starving in Dawson . " But people in Circle say : " People starving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big words , maybe big fight . Men with guns . Captain say : " Okay , damn you , take food and let others starve . " And men run all over boat , take all food . Boat stay there empty . Pretty soon , boat fast in ice . Never go to Dawson because captain say : " What the hell ? " ' Then the first driver made his point : ' Sarqaq , s'pose you and dog team , food go to Circle , same men stop you . Same men take everything . No food can go past Circle , damn sure . '  | The three drivers talked for some time , discussing routes which could be traversed without the men of Circle becoming aware that a dog team was in the vicinity , and on the night prior to departure Sarqaq informed Klope of his strategy : Not bad men , hungry men . We go . . . ' and with his hands he indicated the town of Circle on the left bank of the river while a dog team headed far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montana were up early to help finish last-minute preparations , and by the time dawn arrived , almost the entire Fort was present and making predictions : They 'll never make it ' and No white man can go that far in winter ' and If anyone can make it , Sarqaq can . ' Klope , growing impatient at any delay , was about to stride off when an old woman , daughter of some early Canadian miner and an Athapascan squaw , came pottering out to stop him yet again . She brought with her an object which she obviously considered precious , a crock made of clay , inside which lay something wrapped in a damp cloth . A widow now , she served as cook for one of the merchant dormitories , and as she handed Klope her treasure she said , with the wisdom of decades in the north : It can never be a house without this . God would not allow . ' Klope thought the gift must be a Bible , but why have it in a damp crock ? What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gnarled from much labor , she loosened the cloth , and when Klope peered inside the crock all he could see was a loose round ball of what looked like the dough from which his mother had baked German cookies . What is it ? ' he repeated , and the old woman said : Sourdough . Keep warm . Keep with you . It will make life . . . ' She hesitated , for she could not think of one word that could describe the difference between having a good strain of sourdough and none . Her family of sourdough dated back to 1847 , when the Hudson 's Bay people built the fort in which her grandmother had worked as cook . The dough had reached the Yukon after a perilous trip from eastern Canada , where its ancestry had come after a similar trip from Vermont , where the strain had already been kept alive for forty years , dating back to 1809 . It was a gift of antiquity and civilization and love which the old woman was turning over to Klope , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damp cloths like this , the women of Vermont and Quebec and Fort Yukon had kept the strain of yeast viable , and now she was turning the job over to a new caretaker . Weighing the crock in both hands , Klope said : I ca n't carry this all the way to Dawson , ' but she warned him : Gold comes , goes . ' With a sweep of her hand she indicated all the men of Fort Yukon : They look , they look . S'pose they find ? Gamble it away . Pretty women . ' Pressing the crock into Klope 's hands , she said : But good sourdough . . . it goes on forever . ' In the world she had been able to observe from the lonely fort on the Yukon , gold had accomplished very little , but a family with a reliable crock of sourdough was on its way to happiness . This crock was obviously too heavy to lug all the way to Dawson City , but Sarqaq , immensely reverent where a strain of proved leaven was con- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the little glass jars in which California farmers were now packing their cooked vegetables , he transferred the sourdough , and showed Klope how to carry it close to his body so the precious yeast did not freeze . With the old woman 's blessing and cheers from the men , the two daring travelers set forth , and as they pulled out of the Fort they presented sharply contrasting appearances . Klope was tall and thin , dressed in an American 's version of what an arctic explorer should wear , which was about the same as what an American farmer in Idaho should wear : heavy clothes , heavy leather boots , heavy cap with very heavy earflaps . It was good clothing , appropriate for a day 's hard work in cold weather , and he presented an impressive figure when he stepped behind the sled . An observer would have said : He 's not one to fool with . ' But how the clothing would serve for eighteen days when it could not be taken off at night , one could not guess . Sarqaq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his people had developed over thousands of years of arctic living . No item was heavy ; all seemed to be composed of many layers of the thinnest and lightest skin possible . His boots were made of caribou leather , tanned to perfection , and lined not only with caribou but with the almost weightless fur of baby seal . His trousers were miracles of lightness and durability , stiff when he put them on , supple as he began to move . He wore five shirts and jackets , each seemingly thinner than the preceding one , and his hood was a marvel , a capacious cavern in which his head could hide from snow and sleet , and from whose edges he would gain both protection and warmth , for it was trimmed with wolverine hair that had the mysterious quality of not allowing ice to form along its tips . The Eskimo 's arctic costume had one further advantage , not a minor one : it was completely watertight , and would , if its wearer were suddenly pitched into some ocean wave or river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was formidable gear , in which a man could work all day and sleep all night with the maximum comfort available in the arctic . One would suppose that with this advantage in clothing and with a superior knowledge of dogsleds and river trails that Sarqaq would outdistance Klope in everything , but that was not to be , for the big man knew how to husband his strength and how to pull courage from the gut , ' as he phrased it . An Eskimo with seven good dogs could harness them in either of two ways : some excellent drivers liked to have three pairs , each pair yoked side-by-side , with a lead dog in front , his chain locked into the chain which ran down the center and attached to the sled . If a man had seven or nine superbly trained dogs long accustomed to this hitch , that was the way to do it , but there was an element of show in such a harnessing . Tough-minded men who liked to move a maximum weight of cargo hitched their seven dogs in tandem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harness tying directly into that of his follower . Such a hitch had the advantage of allowing the three key dogs  --  lead , swing , wheel  --  to perform at maximum and to utilize whatever skills they had mastered . Sarqaq , who had done much hauling in the areas bordering on the Yukon Flats , preferred the tandem hitch and used it to perfection . Regardless of which harnessing the driver adopted , his dogs pulled the  | same kind of sled . If the trip was for show , or for the conveying of young women or a well-to-do couple , the sled looked like an ordinary sleigh familiar in either Russia or the United States : a commodious and wellupholstered place for two persons to sit , a handrail for the driver in the rear to use when he caught a ride , and long after-runners for him to stand on when doing so . But when , as in Sarqaq 's missions , the sled had to carry the maximum freight , it was a low sturdy vehicle with no frills , wide , heavy runners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by numerous rawhide thongs . Either of these marvelous machines  --  for they constituted two of the world 's most effective users of energy  --  required special conditions : in most snow where a trail had not already been established , the man in charge of the sled had to go in front , on snowshoes , to break a path ; the dogs by themselves could not do this , for they would waste their energy fighting snow which might be so deep that it covered their nostrils . When a man drove a dogsled he worked . Of course , if a driver was lucky enough to be traveling along a river whose ice had been frozen to a glassy smoothness , which happened occasionally even on the Yukon , he might ride for several hours , because the dogs loved such a gallop when only slight friction retarded their sled . But generally , in a typical day 's travel of twenty-five miles , the man would run at least twenty , gliding over the snow on his big webbed shoes . Since each dog weighed about sixty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds over terrain that was not excessively rough , Sarqaq 's seven dogs ought to haul a total weight of seven hundred pounds , but since the sled itself , severely trimmed , weighed ninety pounds , the effective weight of foodstuffs for starving Dawson could be a little over six hundred pounds , less the weight of dog and human food carried . During the first hour out of Fort Yukon , Sarqaq established the patterns to be observed : Always that way , ' indicating southeast . Start before daylight , stop after light goes , ' or twelve hours at least a day . Try for twentyfive miles a day , with stops , rest , ' this indicated by fingers and gestures . Five days , stop one day , dogs sleep , ' because no dog could work as hard as a man nor as long . You , me walk . Maybe good time , ride , ' but mostly they would do what Klope had called as a boy the dogtrot . Eat ? You , me that , ' and Sarqaq indicated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caribou , moose and bear . Dog eat ? ' And there came the major problem . Sarqaq 's dogs worked extremely hard and were constantly hungry , but tradition said that they must be fed only at night . It seemed to Klope that a quarter of the sled 's load was dog-salmon dried the previous summer ; a pound and a half of this nutritious food heavy in oil would keep a big dog alive and able to work and , when mixed with just a little dried oats or meal , the salmon gave the dogs more energy than they required . In the cold , salmon did not turn rancid and dogs never tired of it , gulping down great chunks even though it contained sharp tiny bones which might have killed less sturdy breeds . To carry so much cargo merely to feed the dogs was in one sense extravagant but in another not , for without dogs , there could be no safe human traffic over the vast expanse of the arctic .  | To supplement the dried salmon , on which the dogs would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the alert for animal tracks , because if he could kill a caribou or a moose , or perhaps a bear wandering from its hibernation , the dogs could be fed for two or three days with a healthy change of diet and no depletion of the dried salmon . In fact , Klope deduced after several days of travel that since Sarqaq had brought along insufficient salmon for the proposed eighteen days , he was gambling on supplementing the fish with a caribou now and then . Accordingly , each of the men kept an eye cocked for signs of game , and Sarqaq was quite willing to halt progress for an entire day while he tracked some animal , for he knew that whenever he caught one , he improved the chances for bringing this long and daring venture to a successful conclusion . When either he or Klope departed on such a hunting excursion , two rules were in effect : the hunter would take with him the extra dogs to help drag home the kill , and after the man had been absent for three hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate where the sled was waiting , for otherwise the hunter might have no clue as to where either he or the sled was . It was strange , almost to the point of being unbelievable , but in this windless , almost treeless north , a fire giving off smoke would send a signal high into the air , almost half a mile straight up , with never a waver in the column . The smoke just hung there motionless until it gradually dispersed . A traveler could often tell where people were living , beyond the rise of a hill , by the column of steam which hung suspended over their outdoor privy ; such a signal could be seen for miles . It was during a foray for meat that Klope made the hesitant suggestion which modified this trip , for as he was about to set off in search of a moose whose tracks were visible along the river , he asked if this time he could take as his drag-dog not the extra animals , but Breed , who lay in harness like the six other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eskimo said , and Klope went off with only Breed , leaving the extras behind . It was a day Klope would never forget , gray-blue sky , hazy sun low on the horizon , snow bright but not enough to cause snow blindness , a probability of snaring a moose , and the joy of the dog at heel . Breed loved the chase , but he was well enough trained to respond when Klope gave even the softest signal . Breed was in the hunt too , and he wanted to bring down the moose upon which he and the team could feed . It became a rare partnership , even on that first day , and toward dusk , which came at an appallingly early hour , they approached their moose . Now Breed remained at Klope 's side as they both edged into position , and when the gun fired , he leaped like the discharge of a cannon to trap the moose by a leg lest it stagger on merely wounded . Now the problem became how to drag this heavy carcass back to the sled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before total darkness fell , Klope located the pillar of smoke , hitched Breed to the one-dog harness , and looped the free end about the moose 's neck . It was problematic whether the dog could pull so heavy a load  --  some four hundred pounds  --  but with  | help from an initial push by Klope , the fallen animal began to edge forward , and through special effort which Breed knew was required , the dead animal began to slide across the snow . Klope , watching in admiration , muttered to himself : He knows he 's bringing home something important , ' and that did seem to be the case , for the dog stepped high , ears alert , dark eyes peering from side to side , harness taut , handsome silver-brown body straining forward . It was such a triumphant return that as darkness fell , with Klope spotting the sled , he fired into the night an exultant shot which reverberated in the frozen air . Soon there came sounds of excitement in the camp , the barking of other dogs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat , the tossing of offal to the hungry dogs and the warm good of coming home at end of day . But in the morning there came the ugly moment when Klope saw that Sarqaq had harnessed his team without including Breed , who was thus demoted to serving merely as a spare . Shoving the dog forward , Klope said : Here 's Breed , ' but Sarqaq growled : No damn good , ' and Breed was dropped from the team . Klope , realizing that he knew little about operating a dog team , said nothing , but he was sorely disappointed , and so , apparently , was Breed , who showed his displeasure at not being harnessed with his six mates . And since the spares were kept together in a small harness of their own to prevent straying , Breed could not even walk with Klope , and it would have been difficult to decide which was the more disappointed . During the first leg out of Fort Yukon , Sarqaq kept to the river , picking his way across the rumpled ice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glaze ice as smooth as a mirror , and since this was the first time that Klope had experienced such ice , the Eskimo encouraged the white man to ride on the rear runners , and for about an hour , with Sarqaq lagging far behind , Klope and the seven huskies skimmed over the ice through the windless beauty of an arctic day . It was a thrill Klope could never have imagined , this timeless , placeless , noiseless movement through a world of white . When the ride ended , with the dogs showing no tiredness but lying happily on the ice , Klope wanted for one brief moment to shout , but shouting was not his style . Good dogs , ' he said , rummaging in the cargo for bits of salmon to throw them . But when the Yukon took a slight curve to the southwest , forming in effect a detour from straight-line passage , Sarqaq left the river and kept to the east . This deviation was practical only because the dreaded Yukon Flats tapered out at this point , providing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Circle and its hungry men lay in wait just ahead , and if Sarqaq and Klope tried to rush their cargo of food through that snare , they were going to lose everything . So well back from the river they ran , not pausing to hunt for game and missing one day of rest they should have allowed the dogs . When they returned to the Yukon south of Circle , the temperature began to drop so precipitously that Sarqaq feared they might not be able to move  | ahead , and he began to look about for accumulations of snow in which the dogs could burrow if the cold became unbearable . It did . It went down to thirty-below , where Sarqaq 's thermometer ceased to register , then down to forty-two , then to forty-seven . Had a heavy wind also been raging , men and dogs would probably have frozen . As it was , the cold was almost clement ; if you stayed out in it with face exposed , you ran the risk of losing a nose or an ear , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy . As Klope moved through the extreme cold he kept hugging his left elbow close to his side , for this enabled him to feel the jar of sourdough against his skin , and he developed the conceit that he was like one of the gods he had read about in fifth grade , the custodian of a sacred fire , and the idea gave him pleasure : The leaven may not be any good when we get it there , but it wo n't be frozen . Survival for the dogs consisted of burying themselves like rabbits in the snow till only their black noses were visible ; you could find them by watching for their frozen breath hanging in the silent , motionless air . For men it was much the same ; at fifty-one-below they used their sled as a wall , piled snow about them as an added windbreak , and found as much comfort as they could . As they lay immobilized , Sarqaq chastised himself for having been so stupid as to come back onto the river : Colder here , ' and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as Klope pointed out : No wind . None at all , ' and the Eskimo agreed : No wind , but cold follows river , ' and he showed with his mittens how the bitter cold moved up and down the Yukon as if propelled by some strong wind . How could that be ? ' Klope asked , and the Eskimo replied , in effect : You tell me . But it is colder , is n't it ? ' And it was . When daylight came on the eighth day of their trip , Klope noticed that Sarqaq had his mittens off and was carving some small object . What are you doing ? ' he asked , and the Eskimo said : For you . ' It was a pair of sun goggles to prevent snow blindness , for if a white man with his lack of pigmentation , but any man really , remained surrounded by snow when the sun shone , his eyes would fight against the glare so strenuously that he would go temporarily blind , or , if the cold was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eskimos had long ago learned to wear protectors carved from ivory , bone or wood , or even cut from caribou hide if nothing better was available ; the guard covered the eye completely but provided a very narrow slit , less than a quarter of an inch vertically and not more than an inch horizontally , through which the traveler could see where he was going . Often the goggle was painted black to reduce glare to a minimum , and as Sarqaq delivered this valuable survival tool to his companion he warned : Sun strong , no more hunt , ' for even with such a shade , continued exposure to the arctic sun as it beat against snow could be perilous . When the intense cold relaxed , one of the worst Sarqaq had known , the men resumed their southern push , and the Eskimo received a lesson which startled him . That he had a high regard for Klope had been proved by his willingness to share this trip with him , but this did not prevent his holding  | all white men in gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he told his Eskimo and Athapascan fellow drivers . They ca n't move over the tundra like us . And they cry at cold weather . ' Since all native people accepted such evaluations as an act of faith , the sled-drivers nodded . But now , in the later stages of the run when the white man should have been exhausted , Klope was showing surprising strength , and during one day 's run of twenty-seven miles he led most of the way , spent no time riding , and at the end of day was in much stronger condition than Sarqaq . The Eskimo , noticing this , supposed that it was because of something he , Sarqaq , had eaten , but since the two men had shared the same rough food , this theory did n't make much sense . And when on the third successive day Klope ran and worked somewhat better than the Eskimo , the latter said admiringly : You white man work good . ' It was high praise . They were on the river , fortunately , when they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old-time mining settlement that some hopeful prospector had christened Belle Isle and which later realists would call by the more appropriate name of Eagle . It was a noble spot , rimmed in by mountains which occasionally formed cliffs delineating the river . There was an island , which in summer , Klope conceded , might be pretty enough to warrant the Belle , but what he liked especially about Belle Isle was its sense of being a little universe of its own , and when he saw in rapid succession a moose , a pair of red foxes and a line of caribou , he supposed that the animals felt the same way . The spot was memorable also because it was here , or close to it , that American territory along the Yukon ended and Canadian began . Beyond Eagle , John Klope would pass for the first time into foreign country , but he had no one to discuss this with because to Sarqaq , there were no boundaries from the North Pole to the South , it was all land which had to be dealt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to minus-sixty-six , you dug in ; when it rose to a comfortable minus-ten , you made as many miles a day as you could . When they were about forty miles out of Dawson they were once more overtaken by severe cold , this time accompanied by a stout wind blowing up the Yukon from the north , and were forced to hunker down in an area of snow and scrub trees . Placing their sled against the direction from which the wind came , they cut trees to provide additional shelter and allowed the dogs to burrow into the drifts for what heat could be accumulated there . When better weather prevailed , Sarqaq suggested they both hunt for moose or caribou to take into the starving town , and after making arrangements as to how each would return to the river in order to regain the sled , they set forth , Sarqaq with two of the spare dogs , Klope with the help of Breed and a one-dog harness with which to bring back meat if any was taken . It was a bitterly cold , lonesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme weather , and so forbidding was the cold that no animals were on the move . Klope shot nothing and returned to the Yukon , that great river locked in ice , in bad temper . Sarqaq was not there , and since darkness came each December day sooner than on the day before , it was  | obvious that unless he was found , and quickly , night would fall and the two men would face some eighteen hours apart . The first thing Klope did was build a smudge fire , but the force of the wind soon dispersed what should have been the signal pillar ; however , he added more wood in hopes that if Sarqaq smelled smoke , he would be able to trace it to its source . Registering carefully in his mind every turn he made , he moved out in widening circles , shouting for his companion but receiving no reply , and he was about to retrace his steps when Breed , with hearing more acute than his , began to whine and look to the north . There , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs beside a dead moose whose unexpected death throes had wrecked the Eskimo 's left ankle . Stoically , Sarqaq had waited , certain that if any companion he had ever traveled with could find him , it would be this stalwart American . When Klope knelt over him he said : Kill moose . Run to knife . Head come around , horn smash ankle . ' Klope said : ' I ' 11 help you to the sled , ' but Sarqaq was too much a man of the tundra to allow that : We go , wolf eat moose . You get sled , I guard . ' And he refused to leave the kill . So Klope returned to the river , harnessed the dogs , and drove the sled to where Sarqaq waited . In the lowering darkness they butchered the moose , attended to Sarqaq 's ankle , erected a . protection against the bitter night wind , and settled in till dawn . In brutal cold they made their plans . Sarqaq , hobbling about in tremendous pain , gave the impression of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all dogs , even Breed . ' When this was done with makeshift hitches , he insisted that all good cuts from the dead moose be stowed on the sled , which became possible because the dogs had finished the initial stores of dried salmon . Then he and Klope released the dogs , allowing them to gorge themselves on the offal and the scraps . Now came an amazing decision . Klope had supposed that Sarqaq would ride atop the loaded sled and that the extra dogs would provide hauling power to carry both him and the moose , but the Eskimo , always mindful of his dogs and the purpose of this trip , refused to ride . With the aid of a stick and one hand on the sled , he proposed to walk the remaining miles to Dawson City . He started valiantly , maintaining a pace that astonished Klope , but as Sarqaq pointed out : S'pose me alone ? No help ? Me walk all same . ' Drawing upon the inherited strength that had brought his ancestors across the Bering Sea and then enabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sarqaq maintained his pace for about an hour , but when they were safely back on the Yukon , he relaxed his terrifying determination and fainted . Halting the dogs , Klope struggled to get him onto the top of the sled , tied him there , shouted to the dogs Hi ! ' and off they went . They spent the two final nights on the river , cold and frightened as to what might happen to Sarqaq 's leg , but next morning they had traveled only a short distance when they caught sight of Dawson , that turbulent city where thousands of men pinched themselves in between mountain and river .  | Klope stopped the dogs , leaned forward on the handles of the sled , and bowed his head from exhaustion . He had completed one of the world 's most demanding trips : nearly four hundred miles by train to Seattle , three thousand miles by sea to St. Michael , seventy miles along the Bering Sea to the Yukon , nearly fourteen hundred miles up that stubborn river to Dawson . He had earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try his luck on its gold fields . When they burst into Dawson , with desperate men firing off guns to welcome them , Klope acted vigorously : he sold the cargo of food , including the moose meat , for a small fortune ; he persuaded Sarqaq to give him Breed , which the Eskimo did because he knew that this misbegotten dog , so useless in the traces , had saved his life ; and he rushed out to the Klondike , to learn that every inch of both the Bonanza and Eldorado shorelines had long since been staked . When laughing men , secure on their own claims , told him that there might be free sites about four miles away , where there was no gold , he stormed back into town prepared to fight anyone bare-knuckle for a claim . Men who had been on the fields for a couple of years had learned to stay clear of newcomers who were semiwild with disappointment like Klope , and since this particular specimen had that big Eskimo dog that bared its teeth , they gave him extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , that this one would wind up with a bullet through his chest before long . They did not know that John Klope was quite a different type of person ; he did not propose to die in some blazing shoot-out in a Yukon alley . He was angry not at the men who had filed on all the promising sites , but at himself for having arrived so late . He did not stop to reflect that from the time he had heard of the Klondike , on 20 July 1897 , to this sixteenth of December in the same year , he had wasted scarcely a day . The layover in Seattle had been minimal ; the stop in St. Michael needed to rebuild the Jos . Parker had been inescapable ; while the stay at Fort Yukon had been necessary for him to complete arrangements with Sarqaq . Even so , he cursed his luck . Now his problem was : Where do I find a place to sleep ? and there was no easy solution , for most of the town was housed in tents whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many men lived in such misery , and he could find no one to take him in , even though he had saved lives by bringing in the cargo of food . The main thoroughfare of Dawson  --  the entire place had been empty swampland only a year and a half before  --  was a gaudy stretch called Front Street , with saloons galore , a theater , a dentist , a photographer and forty other kinds of establishments for the separation of miners from their gold . No spot along Front Street was hospitable to Klope and his dog , but there was another street parallel to Front , nothing more than a line of dives , called Paradise Alley , and here in ramshackle cribs lived the women who had come to service the miners .  | Some had climbed the Chilkoot Pass , others had been brought up the Yukon on the Jos . Parker by their pimps , and some came as actresses , seamstresses or would-be cooks . Failing to find the employment they had hoped for , they wound up on Paradise Alley in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find . In one of the more commodious cribs lived a large , noisy , blowzy Belgian woman in her early thirties . She was one of eleven professional prostitutes who had been conscripted as a gang in the port of Antwerp , brought across the ocean and across the United States to work the gold fields . They had been imported , the locals claimed , by an enterprising German businessman who knew what a gold rush needed , and they were some of the best workmen , to use an odd term , in the Klondike . The lead woman in the biggest crib was-known widely and favorably as the Belgian Mare , and when Klope complained ' openly about being unable to file a claim or find a place to sleep , an American in a bar told him : I spent four nights at the Belgian Mare 's . She rents an extra bed . ' So down Paradise Alley , Klope picked his way to the Mare 's crib , and she did have an extra bed and she was in the habit of renting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separating the rooms , so that anyone renting the bedroom almost had to participate in the Mare 's lively and repeated profession , but Klope , always a loner , was able to blot out the reality of the Mare 's occupation . He was , however , grateful to her for her generosity , and especially for her good will , because although she spoke no English , she did go out of her way to make him comfortable , as she did with all men . It was when he took her out to breakfast one morning  --  sourdough flapjacks and moose-meat patties  --  that he met the man whose claim he would ultimately inherit . He was Sam Craddick , a disgruntled miner from California , one whose father had struck it moderately rich in the Gold Rush of 1849 , the real one they spelled in capital letters . Craddick had expected to find lodes of gold similar to those in California , and the idea of washing tons of sand to find flecks of placer gold disgusted him . Have you a claim ? ' Klope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here last summer , all the good sites were taken . I met the Mare same way you did . ' So you staked no claim ? ' Hell yes , I staked one . But not down on the streams where the gold is . High up on a hill overlooking Eldorado . ' Why would you stake up there ? ' And while the Mare wolfed her flapjacks , for she was a prodigious eater , Craddick used the slab-sided breakfast table on two trestles to explain mining theory to Klope : Today , yes , you find gold along the streams down here . And that 's where you 'll always find it , time out of mind , if it ai n't in a lode like in California . ' You think the mother lode lies under the hills ? ' I do not . I do n't think there 's a mother lode in the whole of Canada , or Alaska either . '
