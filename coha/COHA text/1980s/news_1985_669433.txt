What country is the world ' s largest exporter of sugar ? // What country is the world ' s largest producer and exporter of coffee ? // What country has the world ' s largest hydroelectric complex ? // What country produces 80 percent of its automobiles to run on alcohol rather than gasoline ? // What country did not make aircraft in 1970 , but today has the world ' s sixth-largest aircraft industry ? // // What country did not have an arms industry in 1970 , but today is the world ' s sixth-largest exporter of military hardware and weaponry ? // What country has the largest foreign debt ? // The answer to all these questions : Brazil. // In one generation Brazil has staged an economic revolution . It has pulled itself up by its bootstraps to build a consumer industry at home that makes everything from ball point pens to cars , and it ' s developed a major export-oriented agricultural-industrial complex , sectors of which are perhaps the best in the world. // ' ' Not since the Industrial Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sao Paulo economist Olavo Setubal , ' ' has a nation undergone such a major transformation in so short a time. ' ' // The transformation has also changed the face of Brazilian society - turning it into a Western-oriented consumer market and bringing Brazil squarely into the Western world ' s economic system , with most of its attendent blessings and problems. // The biggest benefit of the economic shift is probably the diversity of the agricultural and industrial plants it designed . The biggest drawback in human terms is the nation ' s failure to ensure that the majority of Brazilians share in the bounty of the economic boom. // About half of the nation ' s 131 million people remain poor , outside the regular economy . They live in both urban and rural areas . The northeast , perenially drought- and poverty-stricken , has at least 20 million people who have no relationship at all to the new consumer society. // But international bankers would undoubtedly say Brazil ' s biggest problem is its foreign debt , which in 1984 was $100. 2 billion and this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest foreign debt in the world and springs from the massive borrowing that was undertaken to finance Brazil ' s economic expansion. // What to do about these issues now falls to Brazil ' s new civilian government , which takes office today . Incoming civilian President Tancredo de Almeida Neves has indicated that ' ' Brazil will live up its commitments ' ' in repayments on the debt , although he says he will seek easier terms. // But the cost of dealing with this social dilemma will be high , perhaps too high for a government also committed to further agricultural and industrial expansion. // Priorities will have to be sorted out. // In the past generation , after the Brazilian military ' s seizure of power in 1964 , the top priority has been that of getting the economic engine moving . The task was ' ' enormous and ( you have ) to hand it to those pioneering economists and technicians who did the impossible in the late 1960s and through the 1970s , ' ' says one longtime foreign observer here . ' ' They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brazil ' s agricultural exports focused largely of coffee . Today , it exports soybeans , sugar , cocoa , spices , vegetable oil , and oranges around the world. // In 1970 , it did not have a particularly strong industrial sector , but today Brazil sells weaponry to about 40 nations - its Urutu tanks are widely considered the world ' s most versatile - and it sends trucks , automobiles , buses , and other manufactured goods in Africa , Asia , the Middle East , Europe , and the Americas. // One United States businessman here says he trusts his Brazilian-made Chevrolet more than he ever trusted his US Chevrolet . ' ' These are good workmen here , ' ' he says. // Brazil is no longer a third-world country . It can produce just about anything it needs or wants to supply the world . Its industrial plant now produces some 85 percent of Brazil ' s needs. // One of the biggest problems facing that economic planners in the ' 70s was a lack of energy. // The country began its march toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As prices soared in the 1970s , the economic revolution was almost derailed by high energy costs for imported fuel. // A multipronged assault on the problem was undertaken in those years . At home , a frantic search for oil got under way and efforts to find oil substitutes were launched . In quick order , Brazil ' s experiments with a combination of gasoline and alcohol - gasohol - proved successful . Most automobiles in Brazil now run on it. // In addition , Brazilians gradually found oil . They are producing at a rate that could lead to oil self-sufficiency by 1990 , analysts say. // Major efforts to produce hydroelectric power on Brazil ' s bountiful river system were also undertaken in these years . The Sao Francisco River in the northeast was harnessed in a series of dams and power stations. // But the big effort was put on building the Itaipu complex in southwestern Brazil . It is the world ' s largest hydroelectric project - and it was constructed by Brazilian engineers with Brazilian-made equipment and is now beginning to function with Brazilian-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place now , too . There are more nuclear plants on the drawing boards , although they will not come on line as quickly as originally intended . The controversial issue of the danger using nuclear power - of concern to many in Western Europe , the United States , Australia , and elsewhere - does not seem to worry most Brazilians . Brazil ' s nuclear capabilities are a worry to the United States , however , which is concerned that it will transfer its technology into the wrong hands. // Brazilian engineers are looking at alternative sources of energy , too. // Marcos Jose Lopes , director of engineering for the Sao Francisco complex , says that ' ' we are already studying projects in solar , floral , wind , and other energy sources that could make hydroelectric power a relatively minor source of energy by the end of the century. ' ' // Brazil is also showing that domestically produced gasohol , which at first many criticized as impractical and costly , is in fact economical and efficient . Perhaps the most essential ingredient in Brazil ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning minister. // The military government gave Mr. Delfim a virtual free rein in the economic sphere . The result is that Brazil today exports its agricultural and manufactured goods to more than 100 nations . In 1984 , preliminary figures show an export tally of $26. 9 billion worth of these goods . That is small by comparison with the US and some other industrial giants . But when measured against Brazil ' s tally 10 years ago - a mere $8 billion - the 1984 export totals are impressive . Moreover , they are growing . Brazil expects a modest increase in 1985 , bringing exports to at least $28 billion. // Sources close to Neves say that by 1990 , Brazil should be exporting to the tune of $50 billion. // But the enthusiasm for Brazil ' s economic miracle must be tempered by concern over the $100. 2 billion foreign debt . That debt can not be paid any time soon . The debt figure , compared to Brazil ' s gross national product , can not be called anything other than shocking : The debt figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This year , it is expected to represent more than 48 percent . In 1973 , it represented only 15. 5 percent of the GNP. // Yet Brazilians are optimistic people. economic growth has helped fuel that optimism . Although the country ' s growth slumped over the past three years , industries in the nation ' s economic capital , Sao Paulo , are gearing up again. // ' ' We are on the verge of another takeoff , ' ' says Mr. Setubal who may play a role in the new administration . ' ' We should be in the front ranks of world economic powers by the end of the century. ' ' // //
