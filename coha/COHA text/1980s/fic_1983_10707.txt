Lubonski could end the way he did , alone and pierced by sabers , and he grieved over the insulting way King Jan Sobieski had been treated by the city he saved . Then , too , although he had behaved in a more constrained manner than young Janko , he had been deeply shaken by the beheading of the Circassian slave , and as he rode north he reflected often on the strangeness that must have characterized her life . Where had she been born ? Who captured her for what slave market ? The man who bought her had obviously loved her deeply , for he had killed her  --  or tried to  --  rather than have her fall into the hands of others . No fabric in that tent had been more precious or more beautifully made than the simple gown she wore . Piotr knew nothing of women , but he supposed that had he lived an ordinary life , like his brother-in-law Lukasz , he might have loved a woman like that dead girl , and he thought kindly of young Janko for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters when the Frenchman raised a cry , and all the Lukasz party ran to where the trouble was . Too late ! An army contingent on its way back to Warsaw , a rough lot , had boldly swept in and stolen an entire wagon , and were now so far in the distance that overtaking them was impossible . One-third of the treasure was gone , but when Lukasz , blinded by tears , surveyed what remained , he said several times : ' Thank God , they did n't get the tent ! ' And Piotr began to realize that his brother-in-law valued the ornate tent more highly than any of its contents . The eighteen remaining Arabians first , then the tent , then the jeweled scimitars . When they reached Krakow the two soldiers and the Frenchman supposed that Brat Piotr was going to turn his cargo over to King Jan Sobieski , whose property he had proclaimed it so often to be , but it became quickly clear that Lukasz Bukowski intended marching right past the king 's palace and on to his home village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lukasz faced this dangerous situation head-on , for he knew he requiredtheir help now more than ever , for as the army dispersed , the various contingents became in effect freebooters capable of almost anything . So he and Piotr assembled the three men : We shall be taking the king 's treasure to our village , where the dead count 's family must get his share . Then the king gets his . Europe is in turmoil and so is Poland . You men know nothing of what is happening at your homes . Stay with us in Bukowo and we will give you a little piece of land and a cottage and local girls from whom to choose a wife . You can have a good life with us , andp201the new Count Lubonski will be just as fine a man as the old . You saw what he could do . ' So these clever conspirators delivered the two wagons and the eighteen Arabians to Bukowo , where they formed the basis of the Bukowski wealth and prestige , for Lukasz was no longer a poor nobleman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nine regulars that had hauled the wagons and the riders north , and he was at last a man to reckon with . But as they approached Bukowo and saw looming on the horizon the towers of Castle Gorka , both Lukasz and Piotr were overcome with remorse over the fact that they had deserted their knight in battle and been the agency of his death . So as soon as the wagons were safely delivered to Lukasz 's mansion , and the treasure safely stored in his rooms , he and Piotr selected one beautifully decorated small dagger  --  one six-hundredth of the total  --  and ceremoniously delivered it to CountessHalka Lubonska , with a heartbreaking account of how they had stood with her husband in the fatal moments when eighteen Turkish Janissaries had ambushed them , and of how the three had fought almost clear of their assailants when Lubonski 's horse had stumbled , killing him instantly . We did manage to hold off his attackers , ' Lukasz said with tears in his eyes , until we could recover his body , which we buried with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' As a token of the affection in which they held the old count , they wanted Halka to have a memento of the fight : Your husband captured it from a Turkish general just before he was slain . ' But when the two heroes returned to Bukowo village Lukasz faced an accounting which stunned him , for Piotr forced his way , uninvited , into the room where the treasure was being kept , and when Lukasz demanded sternly : What are you doing here ? ' the friar said : I have come for God 's share . ' What ? ' Brother Lukasz , you have stolen this treasure from King Jan . You have stolen it from the soldiers who helped us bring it here . And you have stolen it from the widow of Count Lubonski . But you can not steal it from God , who has protected us in this venture . ' Trembling , Lukasz asked : What do you intend ? ' We are going to divide this treasure , half for God , half for you . ' And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Give it as a votive to Czestochowa. '  |p202Lukasz  broke into relieved laughter , You must be insane . The monks there do n't need this . ' ' You are right , ' Piotr agreed .  --  They do n't need it , but the safety of their monastery does . Remember how it stood off the Swedes and saved Poland ? It needs strengthening against the next siege . ' He saw that his avaricious brother-in-law was not impressed , so he said quietly , but with unmistakable conviction : ' If you do not give God His share , He will strike you dead . And if He does n't , I will . ' Lukasz looked at his stupid brother-in-law , this scarecrow of a man , and saw that he meant what he was saying . ' You would . . ' I will kill you , Lukasz , and publish to the world how you behaved in the battle . ' So the two men sat in the room and divided the spoils , this to God , this to Lukasz , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lift a piece from God 's pile into his : ' God does n't need anything that rich , ' and Piotr allowed this , for as he said : ' God never objects to a little stealing . ' The treasure was delivered to Czestochowa by the two brothers , and the priests in charge of the shrine were astounded by what Brat Piotr had achieved , for like Lukasz , they had underestimated both his intelligence and his piety . In the centuries to come , architects ' diagrams of the great monastery in which the Black Madonna rested would show a set of formidable bastions protecting the compass points of the fortress , and each carried the name of the man who in reverence had paid for it : Lubomirski , Potocki , Czartoryski and , one of the most reverent , Bukowski . So in the grand distribution of spoils from the legendary victory of the Poles over the Turks at Vienna , each participant received something . Poland received a spiritual boon of dubious and temporary value  --  respect among nations for her valor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coffee had not been known in the country , before , but when Sobieski 's soldiers brought samples home it quickly became the national drink ; and potatoes were welcomed not only as a tasty alternative to kasha but also as the staple food of the peasant . The Virgin of Czestochowa , who fought on the bosom of King Jan Sobieski , received a new defense system . Count Lubonski won a hero 's death and a small bejeweled scimitar for his widow . Lukasz Bukowski came home with a name , eighteen Arabian horses and a room full ofp203treasure . Brat Piotr was promoted to a position of some distinction in his order . The Frenchman and the two soldiers received wives , cottages and small plots of land in the village . And the peasant Janko , as always , received nothing , for it had been his duty to go where his owner directed and do as he was told . He did , of course , remember for the rest of his life the Circassian slave girl whom he had buried.  |p204LEGEND  IS REPLETE WITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of nations , and never more instructively than in the case of Poland . Incessant war with Tatars , Teutons and Turks  --  it sometimes seemed as if Poland were the special province of Mars . But Venus , the goddess of love , can also play a major role in the destiny of nations , and once more Poland is a good example . It was Jadwiga , the heavenly Hungarian , whose love for Jagiello , the barbarous Lithuanian , inspired him to develop the courage and the skill to win the Battle of Grunwald . The last two kings of the original Polish line , Zygmunt I , who ascended the throne in 1506 , and his son Zygmunt II  --  who in 1529 , at age nine , was elected king to rule jointly with his father  --  experienced unfortunate first marriages and magnificent second ones . The father had the great good luck in 1518 to import Bona Sforza of the famous Italian family ; she brought with her flowers , music , painting , good table mannersand a fierce intuition where the defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important dynastic marriage with the daughter of the Habsburg emperor , only to find that his child bride was ap205hopeless epileptic ; when she died prematurely he fell under the spell of two powerful Radziwill brothers who , fortunately , had a sister Barbara of great beauty , and they maneuvered her so that in 1547 , Zigmunt could not escape falling in love . Thus he found himself a charming , passionate , knowing assistant who helped him stand off the pressures of the other magnates , but not of the Radziwills . King Jan Sobieski owed an enormous debt to his French divorcee , the conniving Marie-Louise , known to her admirers as Marysienka , who took him when he was merely another magnate and converted him into a magisterial king with a personal fortune of eighty million . But in no instance was the power of Venus greater than in 1757 , when in two towns not far from Bukowo two of the ablest families Poland was to produce combined for the moment in daring enterprises which changed the destiny of the country . At Pulawy , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right bank of the Vistula , the tenacious Czartoryskis , who had never attained the political power to which their intelligence entitled them , were developingthrough study , travel , thoughtful analysis and exceptional instinct a vision of a greater Poland . It was to be led by a strong king who would found a dynasty in which elections dominated by alien powers would no longer be permitted . It would have a properly elected Seym exercising the same functions as the English Parliament ; people living in towns would at last be entitled to vote and own land , and serfs owned by rich people would be set free . The Czartoryski brothers had a sister Konstancja , who married a man of insignificant background , a Poniatowski , with whom she produced six handsome , clever and enterprising sons . One of them , Michal , would be placed in the priesthood , where with his uncles ' goading he would becomeprimate of all Poland . His younger brother , Stanislaw August , was earmarked for an even more exalted position , King of Poland , and groomed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as king he could sponsor their reforms and coax Poland into the family of respectable nations . In brutally frank discussions with their young protegethey said : ' If you do become king , your first job will be to produce sons who will inherit the crown after you , and their sons after them , so that never again shall we elect foreigners , who do us only damage . ' Since he was an ambitious young fellow , he listened . The Czartoryskis were not powerful enough to achieve this exalted goal by themselves , but they had the support of an equally remarkable family , also late to acquire conspicuous power , the Zamoyskis , who hadp206built with their own funds the walled city of Zamosc , so important in Polish history . From decade to decade power seemed to flow toward the Czartoryskis and Zamoyskis , and always the two great clans kept in tandem , striving mutually for a better , saner Poland . They were supported by many  --  the powerful Potockis and sometimes the intelligent branch of the Radziwills  --  but the leadership came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lubomirskis , the Lubonskis and invariably the neanderthal Mniszechs of Kukla  --  but as the 1750s waned , it began to look as if the Czartoryskis with their splendid tier of Poniatowski nephews were destined to triumph , and Poland 's chances for a modern state never looked brighter . In this year of 1757 the studious Czartoryskis decided that if Stanislaw was ever to become king , he had better learn kingly manners , and they arranged for him to be sent to St. Petersburg to catch a taste of court life . He arrived there one snowy day , a twenty-five-year-old handsome diplomatwith good manners and a command of French , German and Russian ; within a week of his arrival he had attracted the serious attention of a headstrong , beautiful German noblewoman , Sophia Anhalt-Zerbst , who would be known to history under a more glamorous name , and within the second week he was in bed with her . They enjoyed a passionate love affair : sleigh rides over frosted fields , with wolves howling in the forest ; a duel in military barracks ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucolic picnics . Young Sophia obtained from this flattering attention a strengthening of her ego ; Poniatowski gained notoriety as her Polish lover , a young man of enormouspromise , and it was here in the Russian court that he was first publicly mentioned as a possibility for the Polish throne . ' With Russian help , ' Sophia said several times , ' you could become king . ' ' And how would I get Russian help ? ' he asked . ' Through me , ' she replied . ' You 're a German , ' he said . ' I intend to be a Russian , ' she said with a grimness he had not observed when they were in bed . The possibility that she might help him to the throne burgeoned spectacularly in 1762 when the tough old Empress of Russia , Elizabeth , the daughter of Peter the Great , died . This meant that by a series of improbable events , Sophia Anhalt-Zerbst 's pitiful husband , Peter , becameczar , in which position he proved himself as incompetent as he had been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inept , so totally chaotic that Sophia had to take steps to protect her interests . Rallying about her ap207group of officers , many of whom had shared her favors , she proclaimed herself Empress and Autocrat of all the Russias ; as Catherine the Great she would rule for thirty-four tumultuous years . Eight days after her selfcoronationher husband was found murdered . Young Poniatowski trembled with excitement as these events unfolded , and imagined himself Catherine 's new consort  --  in Russia , husbandof the czarina ; in Poland , king  --  and he made plans along these lines . But Catherine had moved far beyond her interest in this rustic Pole ; she was now so enamored of an authentic count , Grigorii Orlov , that poor Poniatowski became an embarrassment ; he was hustled out of Russia without wife or crown . However , his ambitious uncles in Pulawy did not intend to allow this unique opportunity for family advancement to slip through their fingers . Intimate friendship with a czarina , even though it had evaporated , was negotiable , and they sent emissaries to St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw her considerablesupport to Stanislaw : If he is not elected King of Poland , some German or Austrian will be , greatly to your loss . If you help him to the throne , you will have bought yourself a constant ally . ' Catherine repaid her former lover in a most dramatic way . When the Saxon king died , last of a pathetic chain of bumblers , the magnates of historic and distinguished lineage like the Lubonskis and Radziwills refused to allow upstarts like the Czartoryskis and Zamoyskis to put one of their members on the throne ; as so often before , the Polish magnates would much rather see a weak German or Frenchman or Portuguese as king than a strong Pole , and they made it clear that young Poniatowski was not acceptable . He and his family seemed to have lost their bold gamble . But Catherine was unwilling to see her one-time favorite abused , especially when he might prove to be of service to her in the future , so after a disgracefully protracted interregnum , in which five nations pressed large sums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisers : We can not maintain a festering Poland on our doorstep . ' As a reward for Poniatowski 's love , she dispatched a full Russian army to the place in Poland where the magnates were conducting their circus . Surroundingthe voting area , the Russians let it be known that Catherine insisted upon the election of Poniatowski and that if any magnates refused to abide by her wishes , they would be shot . In this crude and even brutal manner , Poland elected the king who would prove to be her last . So Stanislaw August ascended the throne thinking that Catherine hadp208awarded it to him because she still loved him , and he told his uncles : ' With her support we can achieve all we dreamed of . A bright new day has dawned for Poland . ' He miscalculated dreadfully . Catherine , watching the debacle in Warsawfrom her command post in St. Petersburg , chuckled with the knowledge that she had solved her Polish problem so easily : Poniatowski will prove a miserable king . He has the heart of a poet . He proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows not his own mind . He will be despised by the senior magnates because he 's so obviously nouveau riche . And in the end he will destroy the nation he loves . ' What will happen to Poland ? ' an adviser named Fyodor Kuprin asked . It will break into a thousand pieces , ' Catherine said . And you are to be there when it happens , my dear Kuprin . To pick up our share of the pieces . ' When he bowed obediently , she added : Go there quickly , Kuprin , and encourage it to fall apart . ' It can be seen from this peculiar chain of events that Venus proved as adroit as Mars in altering the destiny of nations , but the scandalous affair with Catherine the Great represented only half the goddess ' intervention , with the second episode the more interesting . The Czartoryski uncles recommended that in order to reinforce the concept of dynasty , with members of the family inheriting the throne perpetually , it would be prudent for King Stanislaw August to marry one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman his own age named Izabella . She was not from one of the historic families , nor was she what even her friends could call a beauty ; what was worse , she was already spoken of in the Pulawy district as a young woman with a sharp mind of her own . The uncles made the embarrassing mistake of spreading the rumor  --  ' The king is going to marry Izabella '  --  and there was even speculation as to when the wedding was to be . But the king , having known the splendor of the Russian court and the excitement of a love affair with a czarina , could not imagine himself wedded to a drab like Izabella , and he rejected her : Too plain . Too lacking in courtly graces . ' He chose instead a woman with a lineage more distinguished , a face more standard and a mind more vapid , with tragic consequences which would become apparent only thirty years later . In the year 1771 , after Catherine the Great had done everything possible to weaken Poland and prevent King Stanislaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy in which she was supported by Prussia and Austria , it became apparent to Poland 's neighbors and to Europe generally that the amorphous nation surrounded by great powers was no longer viable . Prussian diplomats sent messages to Russia : As long as Poland is allowed to exist , she will form a danger spot between us , ' and Russian diplomats wrote to Austria : The time approaches when we should settle the Polish question lest it become a bone of contention between us , ' and Austria sent a demarche to Prussia : If you and Russia are prepared to settle the Polish question once and for all , we will join you . ' What animosity did these three powers have toward Poland ? There were religious differences  --  Poland was devoutly Roman Catholic ; Russiawas Orthodox Catholic , with all the bitterness which that implied ; and Prussia was Lutheran  --  but even such fundamental contrasts had rarely caused open breaks . Economically the interests of the four nations interlocked and provided no cause for warfare or invasion . Dynastic struggles would be eliminated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the adjoining nations had conspicuously larger armies than Poland 's , she posed no military threat . But even so , the danger she represented to the others was real , and each of the great powers sensed it . Poland loved freedom ; it was a restricted freedom , to be sure , and it applied only to the very rich , but nevertheless it was freedom . Specifically , every incident in Polish history testified to th nation 's determination to avoid autocracy and dictatorship . King Jan Sobieski had been a noble king , no doubt about it , and he had saved Poland , but the nation did not want his inept son inheriting the throne . Nor did Poland want to spend its good money supporting a large army which might , like the armies of ancient Rome and modern Turkey , become the agents of repression . Very rich people  --  in all nations  --  can be divided into two categories ; those with brains and those without . Those with brains make a great effort to hold on to every penny they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patriotism are possible only under their protection ; in this way they elicit the support of the very people they hold in subjection . The magnates of Poland used this tactic brilliantly , preaching loudly : The most insignificant member of the gentrywith one horse and sword is the equal of the most powerful magnate in his castle , ' while at the same time depriving landless gentry of almost all rights and treating them with contempt . The peasant was kept happy by being assured that it was the magnate who defended Christianity . Thep210townsman , who was allowed no rights whatever , was reminded : It is the magnate who protects your freedom and your shop . ' And all were told repeatedly : If the magnate is left free to accumulate his great wealth , you can be sure that some of it will sift down to you . ' Rich people without brains , such as those in France who were heading blindly into a revolutionary debacle , saw no reason to defend themselves with words and built no philosophical justification for their position of privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to demands for freedom . No Polish magnate , in public , ever uttered such inflammatorywords , although Janusz Radziwill , father-in-law of Count Lubonski , did one day proclaim during a drinking bout at Castle Gorka : The petty gentry , those who clutter the palaces of the magnates , jumping at every command , they 're nothing but horse manure . And the peasants whom some of our fools worry about , they 're the ugly little beetles that burrow in the dung . ' But such opinions were kept to the privacy of the great halls , where they were believed and acted upon . And yet , despite all its cynicism , Poland was a democracy ; it did know freedom , and its gentry were both more numerous than in any other nation of the time and more involved in the rights of government . It was the nation 's misfortune to espouse these relative freedoms at the precise time when her three neighbors were developing the most powerful autocraciesEurope had known for a thousand years . The Habsburgs in Austria , the Hohenzollerns in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would keep them in dictatorial power for more than a century , constantly enlarging their prerogatives at the expenseof the burgher and the peasant . At the precise time when goodheartedKing Stanislaw August was honestly attempting to improve the lot of his peasants , Catherine was depriving hers of what few privileges they had , and she would not stop until ninety-seven percent had been driven into the most abject serfdom . To Russia , which was enforcing such a cruel dictatorship , it was offensive for neighboring Poland to strive to build a workable democracy , for if the Polish worker attained even the slightest freedom , it might encourage the Russian to attempt the same , and that could not be tolerated . Poland must be crushed . Adroitly Catherine enlisted Prussia and Austria in her plan , and together they devised a program in which the internal weaknesses of Poland could be cleverly used to destroy her , and in the winter of 1771 three foreign diplomats convened at the Granicki palace in Warsaw to ensure that destruction.  |p211'Poland  's grief , ' said the Prussian minister , addressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided , ' is that no other nation can take her seriously . ' ' Quite right , ' the Austrian ambassador agreed . ' Three times now they 've elected two different kings at the same time , and the ultimate winner had to be decided by warfare . Preposterous . ' ' One would think , ' said the Russian agent , Fyodor Kuprin , ' that they would have learned from our history . One of the worst things that can happen to a nation is an interregnum . That fearful period when no one knows who is to be the next king . ' ' With every election Poland has that , ' the Prussian said . ' We would never permit it in our country . ' ' I disagree with you , sir , on your basic point , ' the Austrian ambassador said reflectively . ' Poland could have survived dual kings the way Rome survived two Popes . And could have weathered the interregnums . Other nations have . But no country could exist for long with the liberum veto . The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' said the Russian . ' She could have survived even that monstrous wrong if she had defended herself . ' Turning to the German , he asked , ' How big is Prussia ? I mean in people ? ' ' Two and a half million . ' ' And you support an army of a hundred and forty thousand . ' ' We do . At great cost , but we do . ' And what is the population of Poland ? ' ' About twelve million , ' said the Austrian . ' But has an army of only eighteen thousand . ' ' In truth , ' said the Prussian , who knew about such matters , ' it 's an army of eleven thousand . They tell the king it 's eighteen thousand and he pays for eighteen thousand , but there is so much deception and falsification . ' The minister shook his head . ' In Prussia they would all be shot . ' ' They do our work for us , ' the Austrian said , and then , without philosophicalpreparation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to partitionthe entire country , so that nothing remains . The German laughed , a thin-lipped , grudging laugh , more in contemptthan jollity : ' You know what my king once said of Poland ? " Let us eat it as we would an artichoke , leaf by leaf . " I no longer subscribe to that . Let us with one stroke finish this pitiful country , each of us taking his just share . '  |p212'No  , ' said Fyodor Kuprin , who had a clever , devious mind . ' Russia wants a truncated Poland to stand forever , no strength of her own and subservient to whatever we three decide , but existing . ' He paused , either to find the right French words to explain his position or to allow time for the others to appreciate the gravity of what he was about to say . ' We feel it would be best to retain something called Poland as a permanent buffer between Russia and Germany , between Russia and Austria . ' The German representative was a tall , thin man skilled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served the German states for centuries and who had acquired from his hard-thinking ancestors a distinct vision of what eastern Europe should be . Only forty-one years old , he had many reasons to believe that Poland would never be viable , regardless of how much land the present partition allowed her . There is no need in the future history of Europe for an entity called Poland . If we offer a partial solution now in 1771 , we shall have to come back in 1781 and finish it , and if we offer another partial in 1781 , we will be called back to our task in 1791 . Let us erase the foolishness now , once and forever . ' He found no support for this daring proposal : Kuprin adhered to his belief that eastern Europe needed Poland as a buffer , and to Von Eschl 's surprise , the Austrian ambassador said that he would have moral qualms about eliminating a free nation entirely . Von Eschl was sharp in his rejection of that timorous attitude : Prussia is Lutheran . Russia is Orthodox . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that that colors your attitude . ' ' It certainly does ! ' the Austrian agreed with surprising enthusiasm . Poland is a Christian country deserving of Christian rights . ' ' So you will carve off a small piece for Austria  --  ' Von Eschl began , but Kuprin interrupted : Not so small , either , ' and Von Eschl concluded : You 'll take some but not all ? ' ' I think that represents a significant moral difference , ' the Austrian said , but Von Eschl was still reluctant to concede that Prussia 's proposal had failed : ' Is it settled , then ? Austria and Russia refuse to allow total elimination ? ' However , when those two plenipotentiaries nodded , he acquiesced with a graciousness he did not often display : ' So be it . A partial cutting away . But in years to come , please remember what I prophesied this day . We three will return to this table , and sooner than you imagine , to complete our task . Poland is doomed , but we allow her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Amiably he rose , shook hands with his colleagues , and said brightly : ' Let 's bring out the maps . '  |p213This  meeting , which would initiate the dismemberment of Poland , took place in the very heart of Warsaw , in the Granicki palace , and when the large oak table was cleared and Von Eschl had spread his carefully drawn map , the others gasped , for the Prussian cartographers had awarded themselves all of western Poland including Warsaw , with the huge expanses of the east going to Russia and an insultingly small section in the south to Austria . No entity called Poland remained . But before the others could point out that this total elimination was precisely what they had rejected , Von Eschl crumpled his map and threw it on the floor , saying with a cold smile : Obviously , that 's not what we want . . . at this time . ' When Kuprin revealed Russia 's map , both Von Eschl and the Austrianambassador were visibly surprised , for the area to be absorbed by Russia was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to Austria , but as the three men studied the map , Von Eschl began to appreciate the cleverness of Russia 's proposal . You win Poland 's sympathy by taking little , but from your foothold , you intend to dominateall . ' Kuprin smiled . He was fifty years old , a man who had served on many delicate missions and who knew that he could not hoodwink this clever Prussian . To dominate what 's left of Poland ? Is n't that what we all aspire to ? ' The three plotters interrupted their map study to discuss this interestingpoint , each disclosing what plans his nation had for the disciplining of Poland , but after a few exchanges Von Eschl said with some impatience : ' Let us see the Austrian map , ' and when it was spread on the table , he saw that to a marked degree it resembled Russia 's . Did you compare plans ? ' he asked , and when each denied any complicity , he shrugged and said : Prussia is defeated . My map is useless , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days these brilliant men sat in the Polish palace and divided Poland , each with considerable knowledge of the terrains under debate , each with a clear view of what ought to be done . Von Eschl fought for all the lands that had ever been held by the Teutonic Knights back in the fourteenth century ; Austria , for the rich farmlands east of Krakow ; and Russia , for the low flatlands that would provide an easy entrance into Europe . If one granted that Poland had to be partitioned because of her inability to govern herself , the partition devised by those neighbors was not impractical . Each received what it felt it needed , and a central core asp214large as France remained-for the Poles to play with in their game of Golden Freedom . As the diplomats folded their maps , each duplicating the lines on the others , Von Eschl said : Our major weapon in the years ahead , gentlemen , will be the phrase that the Poles themselves invented . The Golden Freedom . Everything we do to keep Poland off balance , everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partition , let us do in the name of Golden Freedom . We will become the champions of Poland 's freedom . We will defend her rights against the revolutionaries , When we send our armies to Warsaw , and we will , let us always do so waving the flag of Golden Freedom . ' Why do you propose that ? ' the Austrian asked , for his nation had less intimate experience with day-to-day political maneuvering in Poland than either of the other two . We have in our hands a subtle control , ' Von Eschl explained . If we cry to the world " We are doing thus-and-so to protect Polish freedom , " we will be permitted great latitude . We must show ourselves always to be the champions of freedom . Freedom this , freedom that . Our hearts bleed for freedom . ' To what devious purpose ? ' the Austrian asked . No deviousness whatever , ' Von Eschl replied sanctimoniously . We really shall protect Polish freedom  --  the freedom of a nation 's few wealthy magnates to destroy the whole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after another with the liberum veto . They must continue to own the serfs and control their labor . Let them continue to prevent townsmen from ever owning land . Let them remain free to oppose the king in any sensible move he tries to make . Gentlemen , by preserving such freedoms , we shall encourage Poland to strangle herself , and we shall divide the corpse without our marching battalions ' ever firing a shot . ' Can we rely upon the magnates to commit such folly ? ' the Austrian asked , and the Russian Kuprin replied : You can depend on them to do almost anything stupid that you can devise . ' At this point the conspirators engaged in a negotiation so shocking that they felt compelled to lower their voices . In the heart of Warsaw , which stood at the heart of Poland , they discussed which Polish leader was in the secure pay of which foreign power , and the precise degree to which this patriot could be depended upon to betray his country . You Russians , ' said Von Eschl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the Granickis. '  |p215'We  ought to have , ' Kuprin said , considering how much money we spend on them every year . But you Germans do the same with your Pasek . ' And we get just as loyal service from him as you do from Mniszech . ' ' We have only two solid supporters , ' the Austrian ambassador confessed , ' but they are sterling . Count Lubonski of Gorka , to whom we make no payments whatever , and the younger Prince Lubomirski , to whom we pay a great deal . ' Why do you give Lubonski nothing ? ' Von Eschl asked . ' He 's your strongest voice in the Seym . ' ' Lubonski visualizes himself as a patriot , ' the Austrian said . ' He acts on our behalf because his family has always been strongly pro-Habsburg . ' Smiling , he added : The traitor you win by conviction is always a better bargain than the one you hire . ' ' But sometimes , ' Von Eschl said , the paid spy works harder . We pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' Excuse me , ' Kuprin said . ' It 's Russia that pays Radziwill . And a great deal , too . ' ' You must mean another Radziwill , ' Von Eschl said . ' I 'm speaking of Janusz Radziwill , of Lithuania . ' After briefly consulting his papers , Kuprin said : ' So am I. Janusz Radziwill , whose daughter Anna is married to Austria 's Count Lubon-ski . ' ' That Radziwill ? ' the Austrian ambassador cried , consulting his own list . ' We 're paying him . . . and rather generously , Janusz Radziwill , father-in-law of Count Laskarz Lubonski , of Gorka . He came to us himself with a most interesting proposal  --  came to me personally  --  and he 's been in our pay ever since . ' The three diplomats fell silent , conjuring up pictures of Janusz Radziwill , sixty-two years old , slight of build , clean-shaven in the French style , sharp-eyed , quick of speech and deft of manner , a nobleman at home in any court .. . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two months in Paris three years ago , and in several close negotiations he seemed to us to favor France 's position much more heartily than he did ours . ' ' You must also remember , ' Kuprin reminded the others , ' that France and Turkey are always allies , and we know for a fact that Janusz Radziwill accepted large gifts from the Sultan for a favorable vote on the Ukraine settlement . ' He broke into a hearty laugh , for it appeared thatp216this Radziwill , one of the more impecunious ones , had managed to place himself in the paid service of five different countries . The men then proceeded to analyze which other magnates were receivingsubstantial funds from France , from Turkey and especially from Saxony , whose ruling family had occupied the Polish throne for more than sixty years and aspired to return . When the impressive list was completed , showing the apportionment of magnates among the competingcountries , the Austrian ambassador asked : ' Is there no one to be considered honest ? ' and Von Eschl replied : ' The Czartoryskis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must fear . ' They 're new to the ranks of the magnates , ' Kuprin said . Too young to have been corrupted . ' But they seem to side with Russia these days , ' Von Eschl complained . r They 're like honest Lubonski , ' Kuprin said . He votes always for Austria because he believes in the Habsburgs . . . without pay . The Czartoryskis and the Zamoyskis vote for Russia because they honestly believe that only our Catherine , whom we are beginning to call Great , can save Poland . ' Does nobody vote for Poland ? ' the Austrian asked . Nobody with any sense , ' Von Eschl said . Because if he had sense , he would know as we do that Poland is doomed . ' It might survive another ten years , ' Kuprin said . Then , pointing to the pile of maps , he asked : ' Are those boundaries agreed upon ? ' For the time being , ' Von Eschl said , and the First Partition of Poland , the one of 1772 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once been Poland was unhappy with the new distribution of territory ; some who were now within the Russian empire preferred their new masters and the Orthodox religion practiced there ; some who found themselves in Prussia respected the stern order of that nation and its rigorous leadership ; and a good many in southern Poland were finding it easy to accommodate to Austrian rule . Most of the people living about the village of Bukowo actually preferred the new regime , and in this response they were led by their count , Laskarz Lubonski , who proclaimed : ' At last we have reason in the saddle and the prospect of an easy canter through the remainder of this century . ' He personally supervised the transfer of land titles from Polish law to Austrian , and encouraged his people to learn German so that they could cooperate with the new government.  |p217As  a reward for his services in helping to bring this huge area of Poland under Habsburg rule , he was offered a position with the new government , but declined : ' I can serve you better by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Nor would he accept any money payment for his leadership on behalf of the Habsburgs , but he was pleased when Vienna verified the title Rome had given him and added one of her own : he was now Baron Lubonski of the Austrian nobility , but he continued to use the older title of Count . When he studied the new map of the area , he saw with interest that whereas Poland had previously contained about 300,000 square miles , making it much larger than any other European nation except Russia , it now contained only 200,000 , but this proportion did not maintain where population was concerned , because there the drop was from 12,000,000 to a mere 6,500,000 . The salient facts about the partition were that Russia gained a geographical entrance to the heart of Poland , Prussia picked up a few points of great strategic importance , while Austria , which had not sought partition in the first place , acquired a large helping of the best lands and the most productive people . Lubonski 's castle at Gorka stood at the extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bukowo holdings represented a kind of frontier fortress , and he was pleased to find that Zamosc was similarly situated : ' We are the keys to northern safety . Vienna will have to treat us considerately . ' But he did not voice his sore disappointment over the fact that his major castle , Lubon , remained not in the new Austria but in the old Poland ; the dividing line ran two miles south of it . ' It 's a blessing ! ' dapper Janusz Radziwill cried when he visited his son -- in-law . ' Look , Lubonski , if you have your major estates in Austria , you possess great leverage in Vienna , and if you have three or four estates in what is still Poland , you can also operate in Warsaw . I would like that . ' He asked Lubonski to spread a map of his estates , and when the large free-hand paper was before him he picked out almost avariciously the fourteen large holdings of the Lubonskis : ' Gorka and Przemysl , here at the northern edge of Austria . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with the three smaller ones . Two west of Torun in Prussia , and we ca n't predict what will happen to them . And the five really big ones in the Ukraine . They 're the ones that will safeguardyour income , Lubonski . ' Always eager to know the most intimate details , Radziwill continued : ' How many villages do you own , Lubonski ? ' and the count replied thatp218he thought it must be about two hundred : But many of them are in the Ukraine , and they do n't amount to much . ' ' How many serfs ? ' Radziwill persisted , and Lubonski estimated that counting the rather substantial population of his six real towns , he might have as many as a hundred and thirty thousand : But many of them are toothless infants at one end , toothless old people at the other . ' Radziwill was pleased at the position in which his daughter and her husband found themselves . ' You have castles in four countries , counting the little one that 's now in Russia , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've always preferred doing that , because then you can protect yourself . ' ' No , ' Lubonski said , ' I 'm a man of one country . I wish it could be Poland , but that seems impossible . So I shall be quite content to be an Austrian . ' ' Lubonski . . . ' his visitor began , but then he directed his attention to his pretty daughter . ' Anna , I charge you . Do not let your husband sever his ties with Poland . Events of enormous importance will develop there , and a clever man  --  Look , with Russia , Prussia and Austria all fighting for the spoils , a clever man . . . he could accomplish almost anything . ' ' Where will you be during the squabbles ? ' Lubonski asked . ' Well , I have that little place in Warsaw and I keep the family manor in Lithuania , and I 've been living in St. Petersburg a lot . What I wanted to learn from you , Lubonski , is whether I could use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Austrian interests . ' ' You would always be welcome , Father , ' Anna said , and with sudden emotion she crossed the room to kiss her ebullient parent . He was returning home from Paris and Vienna , and this opportunity to see Anna and her two-year-old son , Roman , had proved enticing . ' I do n't know what will happen to Poland , ' Radziwill said . ' I 'm sixtythreeand I 've had the feeling several times that I might die before it 's settled . ' ' Do n't say that ! ' his daughter protested . ' Our family lives to old ages . ' ' I 'm worried about those Czartoryskis and Zamoyskis . . . their radicalviews . You 've heard what they 're proposing next ? To allow townspeopleto vote , and own land , and even sit in the Seym . ' ' Would that be so wrong ? ' Anna asked . Her father looked at her in astonishment . The heart of the world is the honest landowner , like Lubonski here . He knows what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peasants . The man who lives in town is a bloodsucker , or a sniveling priest , or a Jew . In the long history of thep219world , no decent idea ever came from a town . Anna , believe me , when townspeople in their dismal shops get the right to vote , the world as we treasured it is doomed . ' But can so few continue to keep power from so many ? ' ' That 's what history is . The efforts of men like your uncles and Lubonski'ssainted father , Onufry , to keep things as they are . Do you remember how he behaved when the king sent him to Torun to look into that wretched affair when the ten Protestant burghers refused to convert to Catholicism , even when the students at the Jesuit school begged them to do so ? Onufry did n't waste words or pictures . As judge , he asked them twice " Will you accept the true religion ? " and when they said " No , " you remember what he did ? I was there at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . For the third time he asked " Will you accept ? " and when they said " No " again , he gave one simple command : " Chop off their heads . " And they chopped them off with me watching , and we had very little trouble with Protestants after that . ' ' I have always been ashamed of what my father did that day , ' Lubonskisaid . ' It is the only blemish of its kind on our history , and it grieves me to think that my family was involved . ' ' It settled things , ' Radziwill said . ' Some of my family were dissenters , you may remember , and I suspect that some of them are secret Masons now , but , by God , after those heads rolled in the sand at Torun we heard very little about it . ' ' Whose side will you support , Janusz , if things go poorly for Poland ? ' the count asked , and his father-in-law replied : ' If they go poorly ? My dear son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as always , you 'll back Austria . ' ' I will . Because the Habsburgs bring order . And you ? ' ' I had some very interesting talks in Paris . You know , Lubonski , they 're terrified of Prussia . They believe our interests are best served through Russia . I incline that way myself . ' But you just asked us for the Lubon castle , so that you could be near Austria . ' ' I certainly ca n't guess at this point how things are going to go . ' ' You just said you thought Russia . ' Radziwill looked at his son-in-law in disbelief . ' Lubonski , a game of vast dimension is being played , old France and new Russia opposed to old Austria and new Prussia . Who in this room is wise enough to predict how that game will go ? If you 're intelligent , Lubonski , you 'll put inp220appearances at your castles in each of the countries . Listen , and test , and judge , and be prepared always to jump in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , Janusz ? ' That 's what I 've always done . That 's why I have two beautiful daughtersmarried to men with castles , and two handsome sons married to women with castles , ' He laughed at this felicitous summary of his life , then scowled . Anna , twice in our conversations today you sounded as if you were defending the rights of townspeople . What 's got into this child , Lubonski ? ' ' She 's been talking with this fellow Bukowski . . . at the manor house in the village . ' Command her to stop , ' Radziwill said , but the count reminded him : You warned me at our wedding : " Son , remember one thing . No man has ever been born brave enough to give orders to a Radziwill woman . " ' Lubonski had been correct in assuming that his wife 's surprising inclinationtoward republicanism as opposed to the Golden Freedom of the magnates stemmed from her casual associations with Tytus Bukowski , who occupied the manor house in the village . She had met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters with her husband , and during the next dozen years she had continued to move about the area with that intellectual and social restlessness which had always characterized the best Radziwills . At such times she often asked Tytus what he thought of how Austria was governing her section of Poland : Does n't it seem to you that they treat us as merely another remote colony ? ' And he would remind her that although he did live in the Austrian sector , subject to its laws , his more important responsibility was to serve in the Warsaw Seym as protectorof Count Lubonski 's interests in free Poland . It was an insane system , made worse by the fact that Lubonski worked diligently to bring all of remaining Poland under Austrian rule . Poles conspired to destroy Poland . In recent years things had not gone well with the Bukowski family ; indeed , things had never gone particularly well . The substantial fortune which one ancestor had filched from the Vienna expedition against the Turks had been quickly dissipated in the stables for the Arabian horses that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbands quickly squandered them . In only one decade after the Battle of Vienna , the Bukowskis had already fallen back to what they hadp221always been : very poor gentry with an honorable history and some horses . Now , in 1785 , their manor house needed major repairs and their fields improvements , but the stolid owners went their careless ways , with conditions along the Vistula continuing much as they had done for the past seven centuries . There was , however , one notable change . Tytus Bukowski , for reasons which not even he could have explained , had begun to speculate on the nature of Polish history , especially as it compared with the development of surrounding countries about which he heard many accounts , and he saw that each of Poland 's neighbors had strong central governments , and regular taxation , and armies which increased in size , while Poland did not . More specifically , when he watched the Seym , of which he was now an important member , he realized that almost everything he was ordered to do by Count Lubonski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful only to them and extremely hurtful to the nation as a whole . Tytus was not a revolutionary , but he did believe that the time had come when people who lived in towns  --  some of the best people in Poland , he judged  --  must be given the right to own land , to vote , and even to take their rightful place in the legislative bodies . Jews he was willing to exclude because they denied Christ and the primacy of Rome , which any good Pole subscribed to , and he was not yet certain what he thought about freedom for peasants , since he owned three villages , and to give peasants rights might mean financial loss , but even in this case he was beginning to see that a prospering society required much more freedom for serfs than Poland now allowed . One spring morning Countess Lubonska asked him about these matters : Tytus , when you meet with the Seym in Warsaw , what will be your feeling about greater freedom for the townspeople ? ' When the countess first asked such questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spy sent to test him on behalf of the magnates , but with the passage of time he found that she was much like himself : a person trying to visualize a new Poland , and he grew to trust her . I think the time has come , Countess , when we must have a union of strong men in the towns with strong men in the countryside . ' You 've heard what my father says ? " Townsmen are like horse piss . Smelly , noisy and good for absolutely nothing . " ' That was the old view , Countess . But if Poland wants to protect itselfWould you allow your daughter to marry a townsman ? '  |p222'I  'm nobility , Countess . Poor but noble . My family has always married with its own kind . ' ' So you have the same opinion as my father ? ' ' I do not . ' He leaned against a stone fence that separated the castle grounds from those of the village , and said very carefully , choosing each word for its exact meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his friends , for what I believe the Seym is going to do if it is ever allowed to meet again . ' ' It will do what it 's told , ' Anna Radziwill said , as if she were one of her fighting uncles . ' I think . . . that such days . . are ended . ' As soon as he uttered these portentous words , both he and Anna appreciated their profound significance , for they constituted a revolutionary challenge and she wanted to know its dimensions . Perching herself upon the fence , she asked bluntly : ' And what will your Seym attempt to do ? ' ' Have you listened to your magnates , Countess ? Have you just listened to what they say when they meet in your castle ? ' ' They talk a lot of bombast , but I think all men do . ' She laughed , a beautiful , free-spirited woman approaching fifty , amused by the contradictionsof Polish life , whether in the Austrian segment or the free , and with a finger that contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right now , Bukowski , you 're talking bombast , are n't you ? ' ' I must respectfully contradict you , Countess . I am the voice of the future , not of bombast . ' ' Tell me about the future , Tytus . ' ' Let 's take three magnates . In old Poland , where I work . One takes his orders from Prussia because it 's growing . One takes his orders from Russia because it 's big . And one listens to Austria because it 's well governed . ' ' It 's always been that way , ' Countess Lubonska said , smiling . ' You speak as if there were something unusual . ' ' There is . At a time when Poland needs everyone joined together in a great effort , the first magnate despises everyone in the town  --  the burghers , the shopkeepers , the Jews , the priests , the artisans . They 're all cut off  --  permanently  --  from Polish life . ' With both hands waving the air , he made broad exclusionary gestures . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedoms at all , not even land . ' Who 's left for the third magnate to despise ? ' the countess asked . Bringing his hands back to his chest , he tapped himself with hisp223fingertips : Me . The little nobleman with few horses . few villages . .. few peasants . ' Oh , they do n't despise you , Bukowski . I 'm sure my husband does n't despise you . If he did , he would n't use you as his voice in the Seym , would he ? ' He uses and despises , ' Bukowski said , dropping his voice on the last word as if to end that line of argument . Yes , there are degrees , ' she conceded . Flicking her dress so that its folds fell attractively over the stones on which she sat , she said : ' My father . . . well , you 're right about him . He despises all your three groups . He sees Poland as the fief of about sixty families  --  the only ones in his opinion who count . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broad smile ; then she dropped them to look bewitchingly at her husband'sfactotum . Tytus , when I was about eighteen my father took me aside , sat me in a chair , and showed me a small sheet of paper on which he had written seven names . I can see them yet , in order , starting with Radziwill . Then : Lubomirski , Lubonski , Potocki , Ossolinski , Mniszech , Granicki . They were the families from which I must select my husband , for in his opinion no others existed . ' How were they numbered ? ' Tytus asked . A combination of ancient power and modern wealth . The Granickis were newcomers , but they were damned rich . The Mniszechs were of Czech derivation but they were damned powerful . Ossolinski and Lubonski were both ancient and rich , and Lubomirski , of course , was best of all . ' Then why did he place the Radziwills first ? ' Because we are first . ' Were n't the Czartoryskis and Zamoyskis already rather rich and powerful ? ' Father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a note above them : " If things go poorly . " ' Meaning ? ' That if I could n't catch a Lubomirski or one of the rich Radziwills . .. You know , of course , that our branch of the Radziwills . . . we had damned little . That 's why my father has had to be so . . . ' She thought for a long time as to how best she might characterize her conniving parent , and she smiled as she visualized him in his long overcoatdarting here and there as his probing nose smelled out possibilities . No appropriate word came , and in the end she said in a kind of defeat : That 's why Father has had to be so flexible . '  |p224Was  it easy , catching a Lubonski ? ' From the moment I saw Laskarz , and I think that from the moment he saw me . , because I was not ugly when I was young . .. ' She kicked at the stone wall with the heel of her left boot , then asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to happen to Poland ? ' One day in 1786 they carried this question to the count , who laughed at their fears , citing an old truism : Anarchy is the salvation of Poland . We have always thrived on chaos . ' But if we ca n't defend ourselves ? ' his wife asked . Our strategy is to be so obviously weak that no neighbor will feel it necessary to attack us . ' It seems to me , ' Bukowski said , that in 1772 our neighbors attacked us rather severely . They stole half our citizens . ' That was a readjustment , ' Lubonski argued , and I think you 'll agree we 're better off now than we were then . ' ' People are beginning to take seriously the proposals of the Czartoryskis , ' Tytus warned , and the countess jumped to his support : Yes , I 've heard much good said about their plans , ' Now the count dropped his easy rebuttals , for he had heard even some of his associates discussing seriously the proposed reforms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his senses would even listen to them , let alone accord them attention . I want you to hear , one by one , the incrediblethings they 're suggesting . First , abolition of the liberum veto , the agency with which we protect our rights . Second , the Seym to serve for two years instead of six weeks , and God knows what would happen then . Third , townsmen to have the vote . Fourth , banishing landless gentry from the Seym on the grounds that they vote always for the magnates who pay their bills . Fifth , an end to private armies like ours and the installation of a strong central army , which would threaten our freedoms . Sixth , peasants to be given their own land , at our expense . Seventh , additional power to the king , who would soon dictate to the magnates . Eighth , hereditary king rather than free election by the magnates and the gentry . ' As he listed these demands , his voice grew more and more grave , until at last it was a mournful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an era , and he looked soberly at his listeners to impress upon them the revolutionary nature of these proposals . But then he brightened . ' This was before your time in the Seym , Tytus , but when the patriots awakened to what was happening , we sprang to action . Lubomirski , myself ,  |p225Granicki  , Mniszech . . . there were other good men too , but we led the - way in defense of the motherland . ' What did you do ? ' the countess asked . We proposed our own series of bills , the ones that would preserve freedom . First , the king to be elected , preferably from among foreign nominees , by us magnates . That would protect us from dictators and hereditary domination . Second , continuance forever of the liberum veto , which is the protection of the few against the pressure of the many . Third , the ancient right of any magnate to renounce allegiance to the king , if the king persists in error . Fourth , land ownership and office occupancy reserved exclusively for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of peasants to be continued and strength-ened . ' Who won ? ' the countess asked . For the moment , reason prevailed and we won . But revolutionaries like Czartoryski refuse to surrender , and if we ever have a Seym again , you can be sure they 'll be back with their radical reforms . ' In 1788 , to everyone 's astonishment , the Seym was permitted to open a session which many predicted would be a turning point in Polish history , and they were right , because the sober , well-educated men who met this time were deeply aware of the fact that the salvation of their country depended upon the decisions they were about to make , and they approachedtheir task with prayers and a proper gravity . Historically , Seyms were supposed to meet only in alternate years and then for just six weeks . This one lasted four glorious and rewarding years that saw one after another of the restrictive old privileges swept away : the liberum veto was abolished , meaning that henceforth Poland 's parliamentwould operate like those of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to own land ; the more onerous impositions on the peasants were removed , but of course serfdom was continued , since even reformers could not visualize Poland without it ; the Catholic church was deprived of its vast land holdings but was justly compensated ; and most important of all , the town businessmen were invited into the halls of government . On 3 May 1791 a new constitution evolved out of this revolutionary four-year Seym . It was recognized as the best in Europe and the equal of what had recently been promulgated in America ; philosophers hailed it as an architect 's drawing for a modern nation . With one gigantic leap ,  |p226Poland  left the Middle Ages and catapulted herself into the front rank of governments . The Czartoryskis had defeated the Lubonskis . But in Prussia and Russia the new plan activated alarms of terror , for the rulers of those autocracies properly evaluated it as a mortal blow to their dictatorships . In Berlin the King of Prussia summoned Baron von Eschl and stormed : ' Your partition in 1772 was supposed to have forestalledsuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even one year , it will spread havoc in the German states . Everyone will be demanding similar freedoms . ' ' We must start a war to disrupt things , ' Von Eschl proposed . ' That we 'll do , but first you get yourself to Warsaw and repair the damage your leniency allowed . ' ' Are you willing , Sire , to support me if we erase Poland altogether this time ? ' Wipe it out . ' ' Even if Austria refuses to come along ? ' We 're in a better position if she does n't . I want you to occupy everything we need  --  Warsaw . . . Krakow . . . Lublin . . . all the way to Brest-Litovsk . ' ' Russia and Austria might combine against us . ' ' That 's a risk we must take . But Poland is to be eliminated . It has no excuse for existence . ' And with this harsh directive , Von Eschl made his way to Warsaw . In Moscow the Empress Catherine was even more disturbed , and at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was doing so , the policy that would henceforth govern Russian-Polish relations : ' Whenever the people of Poland enjoy a better life than those in Russia , we are in mortal danger . At such times Poland must be held down . ' After the meeting she held private counsel with Fyodor Kuprin : ' My dearest little adviser , things have gone sadly wrong in Poland . Hurry there and make corrections . ' ' Total dismemberment this time ? ' The question posed the most severe difficulties for Catherine , and she attacked it circuitously : I intended that my old friend Poniatowski should vacillate , for I knew he was weak . But I never expected him to be this weak . When those men laid that new constitution before him , he should have shot them all . Since he refused to do the job , we 'll have to do it for him .  --  Then you do mean total dismemberment ? '  |p227I  wish I did , my treasured little guide , but we must keep one considerationalways in the forefront . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war with Prussia . Sadly , we must temporize . And what we must prevent more than anything else is a situation in which Prussia grabs most of Poland and sits on our front doorstep , growling to be let in to Moscow . ' What must I do ? ' Cut Poland to pieces . Great slices off here and there . But leave a central core , because for the present we need it as protection against Prussia . ' You hand me a most difficult assignment . Kill , but not quite . ' She rose and kissed him , this strange little man who had served the Romanoffs so dutifully , chopping off heads for Empress Anna , ripping out tongues for Empress Elizabeth , subjugating Cossacks for Czar Peter , and now destroying nations for Catherine . We do one thing at a time , little friend , but I assure you that before the years pass , you and I will finish with Poland forever . Now off to Warsaw . ' While the two diplomats were moving into position for their assault on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started sending out messages to all the courts and journals of opinion in Europe , one from autocratic Russia sounding the tone that would prevail : It is sickening to all who love freedom to learn in dispatches from Warsaw how the freedom which the people of Poland once enjoyed is being trampled underfoot by the same kind of revolutionaryexcess which has darkened France with the blood of its best citizens . In Poland the rights of man have long been protected by an admirable system known as the Golden Freedom , under which kings and peasants alike , knights and townsmen , equally enjoyed the benefits of benign rule , and under which the precepts of Christianity were observed . Now the historic Golden Freedom which made Poland a leader among nations is being swept away . Radical reforms strike at the very heart of a free nation , threatening to make it a nation of slaves , and this the liberty-loving nations of the world must not permit . It is the duty of all to rise up and warn the tyrants of Warsaw that the family of nations will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our duty to halt it and to restore to a strong and beautiful nation the freedom it has always enjoyed.  |p228When  Baron von Eschl reached Warsaw he became the leading spokesmanfor all who were defending Poland 's freedom , and he rallied around him magnates like old Janusz Radziwill , now eighty-three but still persuasivein argument , and the Paseks , who carried weight with the distant magnates who maintained their own armies . Von Eschl 's heart bled , almost literally many Poles thought , for the good of Poland , and on his extensive trips into the eastern portion of the truncated country he noted the location of all castles and the means by which they attempted to defend themselves . He was a brilliant , forceful debater , and whenever he met with magnates , for he refused to deal with anyone of lower position , he stressed one overwhelming fact : ' Gentlemen , always bear in mind what happened in the aftermath of 1772 . The Prussian government did not confiscate a single estate owned by your brothers . No Polish magnate lost a square of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over ? You know better than I. Kleofas Granicki , a true friend of Russia 's through the years , two of his largest estates near Vitebsk ripped from him and given to Russian generals who now call themselves noblemen . . , at Granicki 's expense , If you side with Russia , all your precious freedoms will be lost . If you side with Prussia , your estates and your freedoms alike will be protected . ' In this manner Von Eschl won over to his side many of the leaders of Poland , but Fyodor Kuprin was not idle . He met often with his Prussian counterpart , compared notes with him , and smiled when Poles suggested to them that their countries might soon be at war with each other over how to divide Poland . That some kind of further partition threatened , everyone acknowledged , but the form it might take , with Austria not participating , was uncertain . In Tytus Bukowski 's mind several pressing questions arose . ' Why , ' he asked patriots like himself , ' do we allow these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might destroy us ? ' To this he received no sensible answer , except that King Stanislaw August was too weak to discipline them . Tytus also asked : ' How will this nation continue to exist if even more territory is stolen from us ? ' The answer to this was a universal ' We 'll get by somehow . ' His third question was more persistent , and he directed it to almost every Pole he met : What can you and I do to prevent the tragedy that looms ? ' He even asked this question of Countess Lubonska during one of his visits home when the Seym was not in session , and she responded gloomily : ' I 'm terribly afraid a great theft is under way , Tytus . Let 's discuss this with the count . '  |p229When  Tytus presented Lubonski with his evidences of Prussian and Russian duplicity , he found the count reconciled to whatever evil might happen . ' Your Seym has gone too far too fast . Any one of the reforms might have been palatable . I have nothing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . it 's inescapable that Russia should react unfavorably . ' But you 've always sided with Austria , ' the countess said . ' If what Tytus reports is true , there could be a partition between Prussia and Russia alone . Poland could even disappear . ' ' Now that 's ridiculous , ' the count said . ' Poland will always be needed where it is . If it did n't already exist , Russia and Prussia would have to invent it . ' ' As a Habsburg man , ' Tytus asked , ' are you happy to see Austria excluded ? ' Such things are of little moment , Tytus . Poland will always be there , and if a few miles are chopped off for Prussia and a few for Russia , no great harm is done . ' He ordered refreshments and then heard that his son and Bukowski 's were tending horses at the stables , and he sent for them , and when the young men appeared  --  Roman Lubonski , aged twenty-two , tall and extremelyshy , and Feliks Bukowski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he asked them to join the discussion , for he was eager to have his son learn the workings of Polish politics , and this meant that young Bukowski must , too , for in a sense , well-adjusted Feliks was a planned companion for the self-consciously diffident Roman . ' Tytus has been telling us that things looked dark at Warsaw . Explain to the boys . ' And Tytus gave a brief summary of the ominous slide which he and his friends in the Seym had witnessed , concluding : ' It looks like war . ' ' Should it come , ' the count said , ' we have no part in it . . . no interest in it . Do you understand that , young men ? ' ' I should think we 'd all be very interested , ' Feliks said . ' I agree , ' his father said hastily , without considering what effect such opposition to the count 's opinion might have . To his relief , Lubonski did not lose his temper : ' All we 're discussing is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles that Poland does n't need . Prussia wants her share . And there 's no more to it . To start a war over such inconsequentialswould be folly . Do n't you agree , Tytus ? ' And this time Tytus nodded . But when Bukowski and his son were back at their own home thep230discussion was quite different , for Tytus said : ' I 'm a Pole , Feliks , and so are you . What happens up there concerns me and I hope to God it concerns you . . . always . ' The count says we 're Austrians now . But the countess tells me on the sly : " You 're Polish and always will be . " I asked her if she was Polish too , and she said : " Forever . " ' Tytus led his son to a window , and as if to lend emphasis to what he was about to say , pointed toward the river : ' As long as the Vistula flows , it waters the soul of Poland . ' ' What can be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . ' Nothing , ' his father said in a frank admission of the futility that oppressed him . ' But the time will come , Feliks , and be attentive to recognize it when it does come , when patriots will arise and sweep Austrians out of our lands , and Germans out of the west , and Russians out of the east . ' ' Are you sure ? ' Feliks asked . ' As sure as a man can be . Poland will be Poland again . ' ' When ? ' Tytus slumped in a chair and pondered that most difficult of questions , and when he had weighed all possibilities , he felt that he must speak honestly with his son : ' I fear there will be another great retreat , and then perhaps another . It 's even possible that our lovely neighbors will gobble us up completely . For a time . Maybe even for a long time , because they 're powerful and we 're weak . ' He rose from his chair , and again he and his son looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of their family 's life , and his voice was strong as he said : ' As long as the Vistula flows , Poland will be Poland . ' Two weeks later a most fatuous debate erupted in the Seym , proving that even a patriot like Tytus Bukowski could behave like a child when some matter of truly Polish concern had to be handled . This one involved horses . A deputy with experience in both Russia and Prussia addressed the parliament with some vigor : ' I have visited five foreign nations in my day , and being of a military cast of mind , I have invariably studied the armies of the lands I 've been in . And I want to assure you gentlemen that we in Poland are committing a terrible mistake , which must be corrected if this nation is to preserve its existence.  |p231Listen  to these figures . In the Prussian army the foot soldiers who fight the battles and take the land constitute sixty-eight percent ; cavalry who dash about for show , thirty-two percent . Here there was a wild upheaval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the speaker was forced to give . I meant no aspersion on our proudest branch of service . In Russia the proportion is sixty-nine to thirty-one in favor of the foot soldier . In Austria , which has always been partial to cavalry and losing important battles , something closer to sixty to forty . Here again there was rioting and a demand for another apology , this time not only to the cavalry but to Austrian heroism . In France , so far as we can ascertain during the revolution , seventy to thirty , and in England , where they fight with heroic courage to win their battles , which they seem always to do , seventy-two infantry to twenty-eight cavalry . And what is the proportion in Poland ? Foot soldiers who do the fighting , twenty-nine percent ; and cavalry who  --  Cries of Careful . Retract . Retract . And a general disturbance in which DelegateTytus Bukowski , who loved horses , challenged the speaker to a duel . Unperturbed , the critic continued . So we must ask ourselves whether in our new army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend to have the infantry fighting or the cavalry parading . ' The debate , so forthrightly presented , fell quite out of hand , and it was the general opinion of all the delegates , save those who had traveled abroad or studied military history , that no Polish gentleman worthy of that distinguished name would go into battle on foot ; it had never been done and it never would be . Orators reminded the Seym of the gallant Polish knights who had ridden into battle at Grunwald in 1410 and of the even more dashing , daring winged cavalry who had defeated the Turks in Vienna in 1683 . The honor of Poland has always ridden astride some great horse , and it always will , ' cried a Lubomirski appointee , and Tytus Bukowski , speaking for Count Lubonski , said : The Polish infantry is a rabble of peasants armed with clubs , and no gentleman would have anything to do with it . ' At the conclusion of a fiery oration defending the horse , he renewed his challenge to the delegate who had opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prevailed upon him to withdraw it , which he did in a phrase which circulated approvingly throughout thep232castles of Poland : ' As long as Poland has a well-trained cavalry , she will remain free , and if the day ever comes when she relies on the foot soldier , she will march to her surrender . ' But when in the summer of 1792 a group of magnates begged Czarina Catherine to send in an army to protect their Golden Freedom from the nihilistic reforms proposed by the Seym , and when the ardent defenders of the horse saw that the Russians came with few cavalry and many foot soldiers , who occupied and held on to territory , even men like Tytus Bukowski had to confess their error , for the new-style Russian army was irresistible . And when shortly thereafter Prussian armies of comparable composition began to win great victories in the west , Polish reformers saw that their cause was doomed ; by the beginning of 1793 all was lost . Tytus did not hurry back to the sanctuary in Austrian Poland to which he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with like-minded friends , he had given Poland one of the finest constitutions in the world , one of the best forms of government , guaranteeing freedom for all within a workable future , and he could not stand idly by and see this noble vision perish . Count Lubonski , aware , from things his wife had disclosed , that Tytus might stay with the reformers , saw to it that the two young men  --  his son and Bukowski 's  --  did not bolt off to join him ; he kept them tight within his castle and was careful to censor what news reached them . They were fine lads , he thought , better educated by far than he had been at their age , and although Roman did seem rather slow at times and reticent to state his opinions , when he did so they proved surprisingly sound . He had his mother 's brilliance of insight , his father 's tremendous stability , and the count could visualize him performing well at the court in Vienna . ' He could easily become the governor general of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I like the way in which young Bukowski helps him in this developing period . We must look out for young Feliks and assist him when we can , because I 'm afraid his father is irresponsible . ' Tytus Bukowski was proving his lack of stability rather spectacularly . Gathering about him eighteen members of the Seym , he organized a cavalry unit and placed it at the disposal of the general defending Warsaw , but the Polish effort was so chaotic , compared to the steady pressure of the Prussians from the west and the Russians from the east , that not even the valiant efforts of the patriots accomplished anything , and a general debacle ensued . The army was defeated . The traitorous magnates who had invited Catherine in to devastate the country she had once given to her bedfellowp233Poniatowski fled the country . Prussia and Russia occupied the entire nation , or as much of it as they cared to . And tall , austere Baron von Eschl and short , clever Fyodor Kuprin met as before to draw the new lines . When Bukowski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the nibbling away of which Count Lubonski had spoken so cavalierly ; this was wholesale , callous , brutal dismembering of a great and Christian state . For no moral cause whatever , except a desire to crush a liberal nation whose leaders were charting new courses to freedom , Prussia and Russia had castrated Poland in defense of their Golden Freedom . All the good works of the years from 1772 to 1793 were scorned and discarded by outsiders before the insiders had a chance to make them function . It was one of the cruelest destructions in history and one of the least warranted , the more remarkable in that no foreign state protested . A sovereign nation was raped while the trading nations loaded their ships and spoke of freedom of the seas , and religious leaders spoke of moral responsibility and justice . The more Bukowski studied the map , the deeper became his despair . Russia was taking a vast expanse from Vitebsk to Minsk , and Prussia was doing the same , from Poznan almost to the gates of Warsaw . My God ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elongated strip with no logical basis for existence . How do they expect us to live ? ' And he was so outraged that he stormed into the quarters where his improvised cavalry unit was berthed and persuaded a group of men like himself to make protest against this crime . They mounted their horses , brandished what informal weapons they could find , and started out at a slow canter to attack the Granicki palace , where the Prussian and Russian diplomats were meeting to refine the boundaries of the lands they were stealing . As they reached Senatorska , the wide avenue leading to the royal castle and the palace , they spurred their horses to a faster pace , but when the time came to leave Senatorska and head for the palace , a detachment of Prussian guards intercepted them , the German commander shouting : Halt ! It is forbidden ! ' Bukowski , in the lead , refused to slow his horse ; instead he spurred it , so that he and the horse leaped right past the Germans , with others following . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the front door of the palace , and comprehending immediately what was happening , he screamed in his high , quavering voice : Fire on them ! ' This brought the Prussian guards to their senses , and kneeling in the snow ,  |p234they  took aim and brought Bukowski down , four bullets through his back . When his horse stumbled , other horses fell , and there was a general massacre . When the fusillade stopped , all Polish horsemen having been gunned down , Von Eschl walked over to the commander and said : You 'd better shoot them all again . We need no heroes . ' And as he watched , the officer went to each of the prostrate bodies and put a bullet through the temple . No such coup de grace was needed for Tytus Bukowski , for he had died at the first volley . As soon as Count Lubonski learned that his factotum had been killed in the disturbances attendant upon the Second Partition , he dispatched a messenger to the manor house at Bukowo with a request that the inheritorof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the Arabian horses for which the manor was noted  --  and which kept it plagued by nagging debts  --  Feliks rode slowly south to Castle Gorka , where he presented himself to the count , who in this time of sorrow would be his adviser and in a sense his commander , for he still practically owned the Bukowskis and their estate . ' Feliks ! ' the count cried as he hurried forward to greet the young man . ' I am saddened by news which has reached me from the north . ' As he and his wife feared , the young man had already heard of the shooting and was distraught , and Countess Lubonska tried to console him : ' Your father died a hero , and in a heroic cause . ' The count , hearing these dubious words , wanted to growl ' He died a damned fool opposing the inevitable , ' but he kept his silence , for he liked young Bukowski and wanted him to adjust quickly to his loss . Feliks was twenty-two years old , and unlike most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and generally attractive . He had a quick mind , a rarity in his rather stodgy family , and a keen interest in all things Polish , but in this tragic time he was obviously confused and not yet aware that he was now in charge of his family 's fortunes . ' Sit down , Feliks , while I call my son , ' said the count as he poured the young man a glass of Hungarian wine . Lubonski , fifty-six years old and at the height of his considerable powers , fumbled among his papers while they were waiting , and when the tall young nobleman appeared , Lubonskicried : ' Good ! Now we can study the map . ' ' Why ? ' Roman asked  |p235'Because  there 's a new world to be mastered . . . a new Poland to be understood . . . and because it 's needful that each of you find a wife . ' Roman blushed . ' I have not thought about a wife , ' he said , and his father snapped : Young men rarely do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Then , unfurling a map , he added : This time , though , we shall all go about it in the right way , ' and with the young men standing behind him he began to piece out the grand tour they would be starting three days from then . But before he indicated the first stop he looked up at them , smiled warmly , and said : What we shall be doing , the three of us , is searching out the beautiful young ladies of Poland . ' Then he added almost sadly : But of course , with the new changes , most of them wo n't be in Poland any longer . ' With long , delicate fingers , almost the hallmark of his family , he indicated a castle only a short distance to the north : We 'll go first to Baranow of the Leszczynskis , one of our noblest families , then up to that troublesome spot , Pulawy , to see what the great Czartoryskis plan to do with what 's left of Poland , then over to my favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , he lifted his hand from the map and asked the two young men to sit down while he addressed them . ' It is important , it is crucially important , that you see acid understand these two new families  --  Czartoryski , Zamoyski . They represent dangerous forces in our society against which you must protect both yourselves and the nation . They 're charming people . They 're able . And I am the first to admit that they 've done some good things . But they represent a terrible threat to the welfare of Poland , and they must be opposed in whatever they attempt . ' ' Is n't King Stanislaw August a Czartoryski ? ' Roman asked . ' He is . His mother was sister to the two powerful brothers , so it 's a family to be reckoned with . ' ' Then why do you dislike them ? ' his son asked . ' Because they represent all that 's revolutionary . . . all that might destroy what 's left of the Golden Freedom that made Poland great . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men to follow his finger as it roamed the immense eastern reaches of the nation : ' From Zamosc we 'll drop down to Granicki 's castle . He has a daughter Katarzyna whom we must meet . And from there we 'll go far east of Lwow to our estates in the Ukraine , then back to the grandest of all , Lancut , where the great Lubomirska has invited us for six weeks in summer . That you will never forget . I believe she has a niece who seeks ap236husband , and if either of you can catch her , you will be fortunate indeed . Then the portion of the tour that excites me most , down to Duda , where the Mniszechs have a glorious child , Elzbieta , who needs a husband , and over to Wisnicz , where the other Lubomirskis have two daughters awaitingus . ' Placing his hands over the map as if the tour were already completed , he said : ' 1 want you to accomplish three things on this trip . Study the new Poland to estimate its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which of them will survive . And find yourselves wives . The countess has something to say on that matter , ' and with this he cleared the desk for her. ' 1t is very important for each of you young men to find the right wife . ' Looking boldly at her son , she said : ' Roman , you must find a girl who will help you at the court in Vienna . With the right wife , anything will be possible . Money you do not need , but as my father will assure you , for he 's never had any , it is never harmful . Feliks , you have a name and a fortune to make . . . an estate to build . Your family has reached a point where the next marriage will be crucial , and you must consider the matter most carefully . ' As she spoke of the importance in Polish life of making the right alliances , by which she meant important to the magnates who in her opinion constituted Polish life , she asked one of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been preparing in her room , and when the first of these was spread upon the table she instructed the young men : ' One of your most important stops will be at the Granicki castle . A newish family of no historic distinction , but extremely wealthy because of the brilliant marriages the three brothers made in the last generation and the even more excellent ones Kleofas has made during my lifetime . The man is exceptional , and you can learn from him the intricacies of the marriage game . ' Almost proudly she pointed to his remarkable record , commenting upon each element as she went . You must notice carefully several things , Roman and Feliks . The Granickis have always lived on dangerous land in dangerous times . Their men have gone repeatedly to battle , so that many of them have had two wives or husbands , with the mighty Kleofas wearing out his fourth right now . His first wife was my aunt , Grazyna . The second important fact is that these Granickis always had large families , and in building a dynasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . Look at some of the excellent alliances those girls achieved . But the fact that supersedes all others , andp237the one my father drilled into me  --  You know , my brothers and sisters made quite wonderful marriages , but even back in the old days when our Barbara married King Zygmunt the Second , the Radziwills have always married well . What was I saying ? Oh , yes . . . the vital fact is that the Granickis in their many marriages have done well . Look at that parade of distinguishednames . Ossolinski of the millions . Czartoryski of the power . And always here and there a Lubomirski to lend wealth and elegance . You know , even when one of the children strayed a little to marry into an upstart family like the German Bruhis , they chose one with new power and new money . ' The countess looked admiringly at the impeccable record of the Granickis , and with a kind of reverence , as if she were blessing them , placed her fingertips on the genealogy and said : To a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens to Poland . It 's the family that continues . ' Then , as if to share with them the pragmatic lore which had kept the Radziwills strong through all vicissitudes , she told them : Even when you 've found your first wife , keep watching , because the probabilities are that one of these days you 'll need a second , and in our family it was often the second marriage that proved significant . ' With that powerful Radziwill forefinger , which in centuries past had so often spotted the good alliance , she pointed to the tenth child of Kleofas : Katarzyna Granicka . She 'll be seventeen this year and well worth anybody 's atten-tion . ' Even if the two young men had not participated , this tour would have been an important one for Count Lubonski , who had not visited his Ukrainian estates for several years and realized that decisions of some importance were required there , since , under the new partition , one of them now lay in Russian territory . So when he rode out of his castle grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty servants , six wagons , two carriages , forty-four horses , two tents , a complete kitchen , a barber , a traveling laundry and seven members of the Lubonski private army . But his major interest on the trip was not his various estates , which would be visited in turn , but the introduction of his two young men into the niceties and the history of Polish life , and as the group approached each new stop he summarized the importance of the family they were about to meet . When the beautiful low towers of Baranow became visible he said : This is an excellent place to start , for it reminds us of what lovep240can achieve . From this little castle Maria Leszczynska left to become Queen of France . . . Louis XV . . . He had a score of mistresses at the same time , some of them quite famous , I think , and we Poles did n't approve . But he always came back to Leszczynska , for she was the woman he loved and the mother of his children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days they kept toward the riverbank as it traveled north to the lovely village of Pulawy , and on the evening when they were close enough to see the roofs of the various palaces , the count decided to pitch camp in an area from which they could look down at this formidable spot where so many decisions affecting Poland were being made : These next days could prove the most instructive on our tour . The Czartoryskis are relentlessly striving to make their family the hereditary kings of Poland  --  through the line of Poniatowski  --  and each year their efforts grow bolder . You 'll find no girls here available for marriage . They 're being saved for alliances which can strengthen their claim to the crown . ' When servants brought the evening meal the count laughed and told the young men : ' Perhaps I 'm jealous of those brilliant plotters down there . You must judge for yourselves . Listen to them . They 're a clever lot , and although I despise their revolutionary politics , I have to admire the way they 've magnified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them . ' Pulawy was a revelation to the young men , for its great mansions were filled with scintillating members of the family , Czartoryskis and Poniatowskis alike , and it seemed to the visitors that all of them had learned degrees from Padua , or Geneva , or Oxford , or the Sorbonne . They were a dazzling lot , and one entire wing of the palace in which the travelers stayed was filled with artists and musicians from Italy and France . The library in this palace alone contained thousands of books , and Feliks learned that in a large building nearby this influential family conducted what amounted to an informal university . But the young women of the Czartoryski family overawed both Romanand Feliks , who found many to be attractive but all to be of an intellectual level that was forbidding , and young Roman said one night to his father : They educate the daughters just as they do the sons , ' and Lubonski said : ' A dangerous process . Never marry a Czartoryska . ' At Pulawy discussion turned sooner or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Czartoryski men confronted Count Lubonski with a sheet of paper and a question which lay at the heart of Polish life :  |p241'Laskarz  , tell me one thing . Why do you and your old-style friends still seek to revive the liberum veto ? ' ' Because the major problem of any free government is how to protect the responsible few from the pressures of the irresponsible many . Plato knew that . So did Cicero . ' ' But look at these figures . Under King Augustus II , eighteen Seyms met , but only eight were allowed to enact any legislation . ' ' I 'm sure the other ten deserved to die . ' ' Under King Augustus III , fourteen Seyms met and only one was allowed to function . Your people halted all the rest . ' ' And saved Poland from a flood of bad laws . ' ' In later years nine tried to meet , and all nine were broken up by your men . How can a nation govern itself under such circumstances ? ' ' We used the veto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved men like you from your own folly . ' ' Are you . . . you handful of magnates . .. are you wise enough to make all the rules for Poland ? ' ' We are , because only we know the value of freedom . ' ' Lubonski , talk sense ! Your creatures may have broken up a Seym now and then to protect your freedom , not Poland 's , but what about those that were broken up with the money of some foreign power , to protect their interests , not Poland 's ? ' ' That never happened . ' t Coldly , bitterly , the facts were set forth : ' In 1730 France paid the Bishop of Smolen sixty thousand livres to negate all the good work that the Seym had accomplished . A few years later Russia paid Granicki forty thousand rubles to do the same for it . Not long ago Prussia paid Pasek fifteen thousand ducats . And God knows how many thalers Austria paid her agents in the Seym to render it futile . ' Lubonski ignored this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland 's strongest points : ' Look at it this way , Czartoryski . What is the biggest complaint we have right now from our neighbors ? That their peasants are flooding into Poland , depriving their owners of valuable property . And why do they come to us like an unending plague of locusts ? Because they know that Poland is free and their homelands are not . ' From Pulawy  --  memories of which lingered even as they headed eastward , for in this little village men discussed matters which gnawed at the soul  --  the travelers proceeded to two of the major Lubonski estates , the mansion at Ostroleka and the name-castle at Lubon , where only agricul/tural business was conducted . But when they resumed their journey , there was much exciting talk about the approaching halt at the walled town of Zamosc , where the other radical family centered , the noble Zamoyskis . ' I do not like them , ' the count said as they approached the town , but at various crises in our history some Zamoyski has stepped forward to save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he added sardonically , when the danger passed we found that somehow or other the Zamoyski in question had acquired seven more villages and two thousand more serfs . They own most of this part of Poland . ' They stayed eight days with this powerful clan , one much ruder than the cultivated Czartoryskis , but just as Feliks was about to relegate the Zamoyskis to a lower stratum , he learned that two men in the family had been rectors of Italian universities . They 're different , ' the count explainedwhen they were alone one night . ' I would never want you to marry a Zamoyska . . . far too unreliable . . . new ideas all the time . But I think that in a time of crisis like this , they should be listened to . ' Laughing , he added : What I 'm advising is , listen to the men but do n't look at the women . ' His counsel was unneeded . There were three Zamoyski girls of marriageableage , but it was painfully obvious that each considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what conversation there was centered on the recent partition and was carried on by the elders . ' Do you think there will be another ? ' Lubonski asked . Without question , ' Zamoyski said . Prussia and Russia are rapacious , so for us it 's merely a question of " Will they bring Austria in this time ? " and if they do , " Where will we wind up , in Austria or Russia ? " ' What is your thinking ? ' Well , I know you 're an Austrian at heart , Lubonski , and I know you feel that Habsburg rule is on the whole congenial , but I tend to think that the future lies with Russia . More excitement . . . more energy . . . more . . . You 'll laugh at this , but I see Russia as having more poetry and music , and any nation which has them in abundance lasts a long time . I hear damned little singing in Austria . ' Lubonski could not accept this : ' Wait ! Wait ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the symphonies , the little groups . ' Paid music , yes , ' Zamoyski agreed , ' but the music of the soul , no . ' ' If there is another partition , where do you suppose Zamosc . . your castles and mine , that is , where will they land ? '  |p243I  . . . think . . . ' He paused a long time , obviously not happy with his alternatives . I . . . suppose . . . Austria . ' I 'm relieved , ' Lubonski said , and the wise old man who had charted the Zamoyski course for many years nodded : I was sure you would be . Will you be moving to Vienna ? ' I doubt it , ' Lubonski said . You know they 've made me a baron there . But I 'm sure my son here will in due course . As soon as he 's married ... after he finds his bride , that is . ' In the awkward pause Zamoyski made no attempt to propose one of his granddaughters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with these reactionary rural men , and two days later the visitors departed , with Roman and Feliks expressing no regrets . They were excited by the prospects of the next stop , for there they would meet for the first time the mighty Granicki family , including the legendary Kleofas of the four wives and ten children . As they approached the huge , stumpy , thick-walled Radzyn Castle that had withstoodhalf a dozen sieges , Lubonski told them : You saw my wife 's chart . I have nothing to add except that Kleofas has always been strongly in the pay of the Russians , so let 's not speak well of Austria . ' But minutes after they met him , huge , bulky , head-shaven Kleofas growled from beneath his monstrous mustaches : ' By God , Lubonski , I wish my estates had fallen into Austrian hands rather than Russian . You were damned lucky . Catherine has stolen two of my best lands from me and I 'm worried sick trying to protect my other two from her rapacity . ' The young men liked Kleofas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epitome of the old Poland , for he dressed in the style of the 1400s in long , sweeping cloaks covered with embroidery and chains , and he talked in that style too , with many round oaths and recollections of battle . Six of his children were sharing the castle with him at the moment , each in his or her own suite of gusty rooms adorned with wall hangings from the past , and one of them was the unmarried daughter Katarzyna , seventeen and charming in her various costumes , also in the style of the 1400s . She was the daughter of Kleofas ' fourth wife , a Lubonska who had the grace which characterized that family and who had passed it along to Katarzyna . As soon as Feliks saw her he was enchanted , for she was a delightful young woman , her hair in long braids , her smile unusually free and warm . There was , however , a distraction : in the castle at this moment was a young member of the Lubomirski family who had been studying in both Geneva and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which madep244him two years older than Feliks and infinitely older in charm and learning . His name was Ryszard  --  Richard he called himself when traveling abroad  --  and it was obvious that since he had come to court the charmingKatarzyna , Feliks was not going to stand much chance . But there was a major reversal during the first dinner at the castle , an affair for thirty , because young Lubomirski appeared in the French style of dress rather than the old Polish style favored by the Granickis , and from the moment he entered the large room with the glistening mirrors there was trouble . Kleofas roared : Who brings women 's clothes into this castle ? ' and young Ryszard affected not to have heard the gibe . This amused Kleofas , and he bellowed to his wife : Jadwiga , we have an extra woman for dinner tonight . ' At this the various wives snickered behind fists held to their mouths , whereupon Kleofas shouted : Let 's see what she wears underneath ! ' And before his wife could halt him , the huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind , and started shouting for his sons to help him strip away the offensive French clothing . Two of the Granickis joined their father , who despite the screams of his women ripped away Lubomirski 's jacket and shirt and trousers , leaving him in the skimpiest possible covering . Now , ' roared the head of the Granickis , we have a true Pole at our table . ' Feliks could not keep from staring at his rival and wondering what he would do in such a situation , and he was astonished at how Lubomirski handled it . Flushed , but showing no anger whatever , he resumed his seat at the big table , reached for his glass of wine and half-toasted each of his aggressors , then sat back waiting to be served . Old Kleofas watched the performance , again leaped from his chair , ripped down a drapery from one of the windows , threw it about the bare shoulders of his guest and embraced him , kissing him on both cheeks . By God , you 're a true Lubomirski . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young man 's plate he heaped a large slab of meat . Now for the first time Katarzyna spoke , sharply , directly at her father : I have told Ryszard that I am like the women of the Czartoryski and Zamoyski families . I will marry no man who continues to dress in the old style . ' Then you will never get married , ' Kleofas roared , for I will have no son in this castle who wears French clothing ! ' Good ! ' Katarzyna snapped , her eyes blazing . You can fit me for a nun tomorrow . ' Kleofas reached over , slapped a chunk of lamb on her plate andp245growled : Eat it and keep quiet . ' Then he burst into loud laughter , pointing with his carving knife at young Lubomirski : By God , he looks like a Roman senator , but at least he does n't look French . ' By the time the visit ended , Feliks Bukowski was hopelessly in love with Katarzyna , and the thought of leaving her in the castle with a competitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lubonski caravan was preparing to start eastward toward the endless expanse of the Ukraine , Kleofas surprised everyone by announcing that he was moving his own visit forward and would be traveling with them as far as Lwow . To the delight of Feliks , he said also that Katarzyna would go with him , for it was time that she saw her eastern estates . It was an extraordinary convocation that Kleofas Granicki put together for his regal passage : a hundred and sixty horsemen , tents galore , kitchens , a priest , a tutor for his daughter , and enough servants to staff a major hotel . A German traveler seeing the departure from Radzyn wrote : Granicki has two hundred and thirteen separate stalls for his horses and eleven books . He knows the name of every horse but the title of no book . ' What made the procession memorable was that on his visits to his Ukrainian estates  --  through marriage he had acquired half a dozen in the other parts of Poland  --  Kleofas dressed all his horsemen in Tatar costume , and when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shouting and firing their guns and yelling battle cries as they approached any village . It made a brave show , and often he rode along at the forefront , his flowing mustaches making him look like a Tatar on a rampage . Of course , he had terrified the villagers in the old days , and in several cases peasants had fired at him to protect their homes , thinking the invasion a real one . Now members of his entourage slipped ahead to warn the people on the lonely wastelands : Kleofas Granicki is riding again . Lots of noise but no real bullets . ' And when he galloped up to the edges of the villages , women were apt to be waiting there with their children to see the crazy magnate . The last snow of winter covered the ground when the **27;11752;TOOLONG approached the ancient town of Przemysl , and once the San River was crossed , Feliks was astounded by what this amazing Kleofas did next : from the direction of Lwow came a camel corps of sixty riders , also in Tatar uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were the honor guard of the Granickis for entry into the Ukraine , and during the entire visit this corps would ride with them . The slow , wonder-filled journey from Przemysl to Lwow , over the flatp246and glistening snow , was one that Feliks would never forget ; Katarzyna rode with him sometimes , she on her camel , he on his , and occasionally they would urge their stately beasts well ahead of the others . He would imagine himself and this delectable girl riding forever into the vast distances , and when Katarzyna asked : Would you be willing to wear modern clothes ? ' he interpreted it almost as a proposal of marriage . The land was almost as enchanting as the girl , an incredible sweep of emptiness dotted here and there with small villages populated by Ukrainianpeasants who existed at the starvation level , then some town of modest size filled with intruding Polish merchants and Jews and Roman Catholic priests who scarcely dared move out among the Orthodox Ukrainians . When the snow was fresh , it was like crystal , stretching forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million little flowers , gold and blue and red and bright yellow , all smiling at the sun and the passers-by . Six of the camel riders formed a small band featuring Ukrainian balalaikas , and at unexpected times the men broke into songs that all the riders knew , and then the steppes echoed with joyousness , and once on such an occasion a village loomed on the horizon , and the camel corps broke into a run , with Katarzyna and Feliks amongst them , and they dashed at the village , singing and firing their rifles and wheeling the camels about as if it were some great attack , and the peasant mothers told their children : Here comes that wild Pole again , ' and the entire village joined the singing . In Lwow , Granicki owned a small palace which he used only for such visits  --  once every two or three years  --  and for six starry days the young people said their goodbyes ; Roman told his father that Katarzyna was about the most attractive girl he had ever met , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man growled : I 'm afraid Lubomirski with the French clothes has settled the matter . ' The count did not inform his son of the probable engagement , and he certainly did not tell Feliks , who was not to be considered a competitor , but he did say to Kleofas : Things often change , old friend , as you and I know . ' Damned well we know , ' Kleofas roared . Remember when I wooed your cousin ? She snapped : " An old man who 's already had three wives ! Begone ! " So I smashed her across the ear and said : " No one tells me begone , " and we had quite a tussle . She was going to shoot me with my own gun , but in the end she considered the matter and accepted me , and we 've had three beautiful daughters . '  |p247The  loveliest is Katarzyna . ' No , ' Granicki corrected . The loveliest is always the one who has n't found her husband yet . For the moment that 's Katarzyna . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . ' I think maybe not , ' Lubonski said . They parted in the morning , Granicki heading northward toward his estates now in Russian hands , Lubonski eastward toward his vast Ukrainian holdings . And when the camel corps started to move through the flower-strewn steppes , with the horsemen and the wagons trailing behind , and old Kleofas and his lovely daughter bringing up the rear , Feliks felt his heart bursting . For the first time in his life he was truly in love . Without the Tatar charges on little villages , and without the camels to divert attention , the Lubonski group assumed a more honest character , and now Feliks and Roman could study the real Ukraine , that mysterious land which lay between Russia and Poland , between Europe and Asia , and the more deeply the caravan penetrated this always-conquered but forever-unconquered land , the more the young men respected it . They were therefore in a receptive mind when they approached at last the village of Polz , the largest of the Lubonski holdings in this area . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many inexpensive substances  --  wood , wattles , mud  --  and it contained only one building of significance , a small wooden church with two onion-bulb steeples painted in red and blue . The nearby manor house was also of one story , but its walls were stone and it rambled over a substantial area in order to provide rooms for the many attendants who accompanied the count on his periodic visits . The factotum , a man named Grabski , occupied a cottage indistinguishable from the others except for the multitude of flowers which surrounded it whenever the snow melted . The young men were fortunate to see Polz at this time of year , for Easter was at hand , not the real one , which had come while they were en route , but the more lively Orthodox one when the Ukrainian year reached a climax and young women wore their best while their mothers counted eggs to ensure that there would be enough for the decorating geniuses produced by every village , none better than in Polz . After the long snows of winter , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Easter , as if the year were just beginning , as it had in the old calendar . Roman and Feliks had an interesting introduction to the daily life of Polz , for on the morning of their second day in the village a young Ukrainian of about their own age appeared at the manor house to seek a beneficence from the count , who sat himself in a chair with high back and heavy arms , waiting to hear the applicant 's plea : Your Excellence , I want to get married . ' Have you found yourself a good girl ? ' Yes , Benedykta , the cobbler 's daughter . ' Does she wish to marry you ? ' She does , Excellence , and she hopes we may have the cottage that old Natasha occupied . ' ' Is Natasha dead ? ' ' No , her mind left her . . . during the coldest part of the winter . ' It may come back . ' It might , Excellence , but now she lives with my aunt and her cottage is empty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . Return in four days . ' It was clear to Feliks that Count Lubonski had decided within the first moments to allow the young man to marry Benedykta , and to have the cottage too , and the postponement was to remind the young fellow and his intended bride that the power in such matters rested with the count , who owned them , and their cottages , and their land . On the third morning Feliks was walking in the village when he saw the young suitor and they spoke , the Ukrainian using a few words of Polish , Feliks a few of Ukrainian , and the former asked : Would you honor me by greeting my intended ? ' and Feliks nodded , whereupon he was led to a cottage near the edge of the village , its walls decorated gaily and its flowerbeds in bloom . Benedykta ! ' the young man called , and a most beautiful girl came to the low door , slim of waist , her flaxen hair in braids , a wide smile on her wide face , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moved her hands . Feliks thought he had never before seen a girl who so completelyexpressed the joy of being young and beautiful and in love , and he noticed especially that her quilted dress , tight at the waist and flaring out below her knees , was made not of ordinary cloth but of a felted material ornamented with tufts sewn to it , and bright bits of metal , and many areas of singing color . How fortunate this fellow is , Feliks said to himself as he steppedp249forward to meet Benedykta , but to his surprise the Ukrainian showed disappointment and asked the girl : Where 's Benedykta ? ' and before she could reply he told Feliks : This is her sister , Nadzha , ' and Feliks felt an actual burden lift from his heart . He spent much of his time during the next days at this cottage , so beautiful on the outside , so meager and forbidding inside . It had no floor other than the earth , no furniture other than the table , the beds and the three-legged stools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father mended shoes , yet it was one of the wealthier homes in the village and a center of much delight , for the two daughters were beautiful , and there was bread , and the parents had their teeth . Nadzha accompanied her sister to the manor house on the morning when the latter and her young man stood before Count Lubonski to receive his formal permission to marry and occupy the old woman 's cottage , and the sisters formed a lovely pair , Benedykta slightly taller , Nadzha slightly more animated . ' I am sure this is to be a good marriage , ' the count said as he left his big chair to kiss the intended bride . The girls also appeared together when on the Saturday before Easter they brought to the manor house the seven decorated eggs which their family had presented there each Easter since history began ; when the count was in attendance they delivered them to him , singing an old song as they bowed before him with these gifts of elegant and intricate beauty : the eggs of Easter were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those prepared in the cobbler 's house were among the most honored : ' I bring these eggsAs Melchior brought myrrh . They are the giftsThat Jesus played withIn the manger . The girls ' voices blended nicely , and they bowed together as if studiously trained , so that even Pan Grabski , who was not a happy man and who disliked Ukrainians , admitted openly to everyone : ' The cobbler 's daughtersbring the best eggs and the brightest smiles . ' By Saturday afternoon , when all the required eggs had been delivered , seven by seven , the large room in the manor house resembled a field of flowers , or a jeweler 's shop , for the decorated eggs , each a work of superlative art , shone in the shadows : red and green and blue and gold and a dazzling black that made the other colors dance . Each family hadp250its own preferred designs , several hundred to choose from , and each colored its eggs according to secrets long protected , but in the end the total collection from the village formed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle and magnificent blending of a small fragile thing and the longing of human beings to create something of beauty . Feliks was awed by the Easter eggs of the Ukraine and pleased by the imaginative use to which Count Lubonski put them . On Easter Monday , at nine in the morning , he allowed the children of Polz to gather at his grounds , about which his servants had hidden the eggs provided by the parents , and at the firing of a gun the little ones were free to run where they wished in search of the colored eggs , but Lubonski held in his personal reserve about four dozen , which he himself distributed to the children who were too small to find any for themselves . Mothers and fathers beamed at the benevolence of their count . After the rigors of Lent were relaxed , the village held a dance at which the cobbler 's daughter and her young man were feasted , and it lasted three riotous days , during which the fiddle , the flute and the tambor were constantly at work , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time Feliks and Roman saw the robust , artistic dancing of the Ukrainian peasant , so much more earthy and vigorous than that of their homeland , and Feliks in particular noticed the enticing manner in which Nadzha twirled to cause her heavy dress to flare out parallel to the floor while she flashed her pretty eyes this way and that as her head turned in the echoing air . She was delectable , the essence of a young woman flirting , whispering , laughing to the young men of her village : Here I am , Nadzha the cobbler 's daughter , Nadzha the beautiful dancer . ' Feliks Bukowski was dangerously attracted to her , for after he had danced with her several times at the extended party , and the fiddle and flute fell silent , he walked with her along the edges of the village , and although he was himself responsible for the peasants of three similar villages in Poland , it was only through her that he learned what village life meant , and the grave obligations he undertook when he presumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years , ' Nadzha said one day in a remarkable confession . Then the five babies come , and we grow fat , and we lose a tooth here and there , and '  --  she pointed to the women moving through her village  --  ' at twenty-seven we 're old women and the felted skirts are put away . At thirty-eight we 're dead , and our husbands findp251themselves a second bride , and the dancing begins again . And it is like this forever . ' As the days passed , with Lubonski inspecting all things and holding long meetings with Grabski over the accounts , Feliks and Nadzha wandered farther and farther from the village , until at last they reached that grove of birch trees by the small stream where , like others before them , they were hidden from sight , and they allowed the full springtime flood of passion to sweep over them . Nadzha , even though she appreciatedthe ignominy that would result if she became pregnant , could not reject this fleeting opportunity for love with a sensitive man , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Oh , Nadzha , you 're doing a terrible thing . No man in this village will have you when he leaves . ' I do not care , ' she cried defiantly , glancing at her mother as she tended her chores . Benedykta  --  miraculously safe in her own marriage , for often , she had observed , it was the most beautiful girls who had the greatest difficulty in landing a man  --  brought her mother into the argument : Nadzha is destroying herself . Speak to her . ' , Time destroys us , ' the old woman said , and she left it at that . He will leave you , ' Benedykta predicted . And with a baby , no doubt . And then where in God 's hell will you be ? ' But Feliks did not propose to leave this impeccable girl , so much more sincere than Katarzyna Granicka , with whom he had been so deeply in love three weeks before , and as he pondered what to do , it occurred to him for the first time that magnates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ :  --  Lubonski , Granicki , Bukowski  --  whereas peasants , who were just as vital and important to the land , had none . Nadzha , the most exciting and challenging woman he had ever met , was nameless , and when she died , having borne her five children , she and all memories of her would perish from human record and from her corner of the steppes . Then he had an idea . Reporting to Lubonski early one morning , he said : Grabski is not happy here , and I can see you 're not happy with Grabski . Why not let me be your factor for the Ukraine ? Here and the three other estates . I could earn you  --  ' Feliks ! ' the count broke in peremptorily . The most terrible thing a young man in your position could possibly do , I mean even worse than murder , is to accept a job as factotum , for anybody , anywhere , under any conditions . '  |p252But  why ? I can count . I can manage . ' Once you retreat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manager , you announce to the world that you have surrendered ambition , that you are of the fifth category  --  as disgraceful as if you were in trade , or lending money like a Jew . ' You mean . .. I can never work ? ' Of course you can work . For the king . . . for the Austrian emperor . for the church if you have the vocation . . . or for the cavalry . But never as the manager of someone 's estates . That contaminates you . . . demotes you from the ranks of gentry . ' When Feliks started to explain that he could reorganize the Lubonski estates and produce real income , the count said gently : ' I know very well what 's causing this insanity . You 've fallen in love with some girl in the village and you imagine yourself  --  ' He broke off that line of reasoning and added harshly : Whoever she is , she ca n't read . She knows nothing . She has one dress . She 's Orthodox , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'll be old and fat and lazy , and then where in hell will you be , saddled with such a wife ? ' He rose and stamped about the room . Where is your undying love for that little Granicki girl ? You could have had a magnate 's daughter . . . and you set your heart on some Ukrainian peasant . I 'm disgusted with you . ' And he would say no more . Feliks kept to his room the rest of that long day , angered and embitteredby the count 's behavior and deeply tormented by the problem of the Ukrainian peasants , who labored so diligently and received so little , but even in those troubled hours he did not yet equate the plight of the Ukrainian serf with that of his own peasants . Nadzha 's mournful summarydescribed the peasants of Polz , not of Bukowo . After a sleepless night he rose early and walked through the quiet village to the cobbler 's cottage , where he knocked on the wooden door , polished and waxed for Easter , and called out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise , it was Benedykta who opened the door , and she said grimly : Nadzha 's gone . She 's gone for good . ' Why ? ' Feliks cried , pain echoing in his voice . Grabski came yesterday in the afternoon . He took her to the manor house , to see you I supposed . But it was n't that . The count told her that she must leave this village forever . that she no longer had a place here . And Grabski brought her back and told us all : " If she sleeps here this night , you lose your cottage and your cobbler 's bench and this girl 's wedding will be forbidden , " meaning me. '  |p253What  happened ? ' We wrapped her a little bundle  --  her felted dress , her sewing  --  and she started to walk to some village not belonging to the count . ' Where did she go ? ' Who knows ? ' As she said this , Benedykta drew back into the protection of her dark cottage . You did this , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose my intended too . ' Feliks ran to the stables attached to the manor and leaped upon a horse already saddled and intended for the count 's morning ride . Spurring it cruelly , he galloped out to the road that Nadzha must have taken , calling for her vainly as he went . It was a narrow pathway , hardly a road , but it led through flowered glades and out into the immensity of the Ukrainian steppe , and when he reached a spot from which the village could no longer be seen , or any other habitation , he realized that Nadzha must have followed some other route into her exile , and he leaned down upon his horse 's head and wept . The first four days of the journey back to Poland were a solemn affair , because the count was openly displeased by the behavior of his young protege and would not speak with him , but Roman was more kindly disposed and it was now that the two young men drew closer together . She was beautiful , ' Roman said . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean real love with a wonderful girl ? ' Oh , no ! ' Roman said quickly . Are you going to marry Katarzyna Granicka ? ' Oh , no ! ' They rode in silence , after which Roman said tentatively : I thought you were in love with Katarzyna . . . the camel rides , I mean . . . and she did kiss you goodbye . ' I was in love with her , ' Feliks said , sitting sideways in his saddle so he could speak more easily . I think anyone would find himself in love with her . ' I think I was . . . in a way , ' Roman said , but then he blushed so furiously that Feliks dared not question him further . On the sixth day , when they had passed Przemysl , the count resumed the instruction of his young charges : In the morning we shall arrive at Lancut , and riders have informed me that the Princess Lubomirska is already there for her summer visit . She 's an extraordinary woman and deserves your fullest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born Izabella Czartoryska of the great family at Pulawy . She 's about my age , a little older maybe , and has become a handsome woman . ' Realizing that this must sound odd to the young men , as if she had not been a handsome girl , he added : On one point you must remain silent , even if she touches upon it . As a young girl she was supposed to marry Stanislaw Poniatowski , who became king , but he refused her . - . said she was too ugly . The wound never healed , and even though she married the best of the Lubomirskis and inherited their many castles , she has borne the scar and has worked day and night to drive Poniatowski from his throne . She is his mortal enemy , and before this century is out she will have her revenge . ' Is she an ugly woman ? ' Feliks asked . Heavens , no ! In European courts she is known as a beauty , but I find that European courts use that word for any woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-five thousand serfs and nineteen castles . ' Has she so much ? ' Feliks asked , and Lubonski said : More . ' They broke camp at seven and made an easy ride to Lancut , a vast establishment with which the count was familiar but which stunned the young men , for its size and grandeur exceeded even what they had been told . A tall iron fence , its segments imported from Prague , enclosed a park the size of a large town , in the center of which , surrounded by a broad , deep moat and perched on a man-made hillock , rose what had once been a : walled castle of enormous strength but which had recently been converted into an Italian-style palazzo with the original castle buried somewhere within it . Its main entrance , set in a three-storied pink-and-white wall , and flanked by two tall towers with onion-bulb tops in the Russian style , was an ornately carved doorway which would have graced a cathedral , composedas it was of four concentric arches , each handsomely carved with allegorical marble figures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color was used in the nine or ten very large buildings on the palace grounds : the orangerie , the games house , the music hall , the little Greek-and-Roman museum and the huge stables . The lawn ; which was kept meticulously trimmed by forty-seven scythe-wielding peasants who worked incessantly , was enormous ; truly , one could not see the end of it , so far did it reach , broken here and there by lakes and fountains and running streams . One of the towers was completely covered with pale-green ivy , which made it appear to be very old , like some castle along the Rhine ; the other , of gleaming white marble , seemed as if it had been built a month ago.  |p255And  everywhere Feliks looked he saw the tall , noble , varied trees of Lancut : pines from Norway , cedars imported from Lebanon , poplars shipped in from Lombardy , oak trees from England , clusters of birches from Russia and specimens of all the strong trees from Poland itself . Lancut was a feast to the eye , all parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction , and notoriety throughout Europe , was the central palace . It contained three hundred and sixty rooms , a resplendent art gallery with works by Rubens , Correggio , Watteau , Fragonard and a dazzling sculpture by Canova , a library unequaled in Poland , and a host of affectionate little refinements : one room incorporatingfrescoes imported from Pompeii , another with the best art of China , and a third furnished with the rarest treasures ever allowed to leave Persia . As it stood in the summer sunlight that morning in 1793 , it represented a treasure of incalculable dimension , accumulated by the Lubomirskis over many generations . During their first day in the palace the young men did not even meet its mistress ; she was in another wing of ninety-seven rooms attended by eighty servants , where she might stay secluded for a week at a time , but on the second day she came forth to meet her interesting new guests ; she had thirty-one staying with her at the time , but the Lubonskis were special . Feliks was awed when he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty , with bluish-white hair studded with diamonds , an ample bosom decorated with a single gold medal , and the warmest , most ingratiatingsmile he had ever seen on a woman of such distinction . ' My dear Lubonski , give me a kiss and tell me which of these divine young gods bears your name . ' Then she clutched Roman to her , crying in her imperative voice : You are to stay with me forever . ' To Feliks she extended her hand , and when he stared at it she said heartily : You stupid peasant . You 're supposed to kiss it , but that 's a silly French custom . ' And before he knew what was happening , she grasped him in a huge embrace and kissed him on both cheeks . Then , pushing him away , she said : Lubonski , you must tell me accurately who this young god is . ' ' He is gentry going back to the time of the Tatar invasions . He fought at Legnica . . . with my ancestor at Grunwald . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the deluge at Czestochowa . ' He sounds as if he might be older than the Lubomirskis , and even older than my family , the Czartoryskis . ' Roman , remembering how his mother had downgraded the Czartory/skis winked at Feliks and thought to himself : It depends on who grades our families , does n't it ? But family age means little these days . The important thing , is he rich ? ' Like a thousand others , Princess , he fought but he did not save . He is impoverished , and like my son , he comes seeking a bride , but unlike my son , he must find a wealthy one . ' Feliks thought he might faint from the embarrassment of such talk , but Lubomirska , as she was invariably called by those who did not know her personally , smiled at him generously and warmly . Taking his hands in hers , she said : ' A young knight 's major responsibility is to serve his lord . His second is to find a rich wife , and we shall find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she would be having a formal dinner at eight that night and that she would appreciate it if they would dress in the old style , to which the count replied : There is no other style in which I could dress , ' to which she replied : You are the conservator of old Poland , the one that dies a little more each day , ' The dinner was a limited affair , only forty-eight in the huge room and only one silver service in the center of the table : a sculpture from Verona showing the many-towered town of San Gimignano under siege , with little soldiers moving to and fro as the silver springs unwound . Thirty men were in attendance , and the brilliance of their costumes made the room glitter . About half wore the ancient Polish dress : tight trousers barely visible under long coats richly ornamented , ruffs at the neck , great wide sashes about the waist , ends hanging to the calf , and various gold chains from which hung medals and remembrances of past heroics . But several , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viennaagainst the Turks , affected Oriental costumes marked by gold and silver crescents , Persian-type gowns rather than coats , and delicately embroidered fabrics rather than furs . These Orientalists avoided flashy jewels , a mere diamond here or there , and they tended to wear their hair a little longer than those in ancient costume . Three men , each one a diplomat , wore the modern French dress , made by English tailors in Vienna or Berlin , with exquisite silken fabrics , tight white breeches and silvered shoes . Roman and Feliks , of course , wore the old Polish dress , and on theirslim youthful bodies it looked superlative , the costume of those intendedby divine grace to command and rule and make decisions of significance . The eighteen women dressed in a variety of styles , borrowed mainlyp257from Vienna and Paris , and their expensive dresses complemented the men 's costumes , their wealth of diamonds and pearls and rubies showing well against either the Oriental dress of men like Lubonski or the more austere perfection of the diplomats ' modern wear . Feliks was seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as Mam'selle , who served as Lubomirska 's secretary but not her confidante , and this woman liked to talk , so that during this gala evening and on the days following he learned much about his hostess : Lubomirska is probably the grandest woman in the world today . Here . Read this . It appeared in a German newspaper . Wolfgang von Goethe said , and you can see it right here . I 'll read it for you : " I remained an extra week in Weimar so that I could converse further with the Princess Lubomirska , who must be the most intelligent , witty and perceptive woman God has made in this century . " In Paris , where I met her , she was the constant companion of two brilliant Americans , Benjamin Franklin , whom she loved and I thought might marry , and Thomas Jefferson , younger and more revolutionary , God forbid . They adored her and brought their problems to her almost daily . She has nineteen castles like this one , and she endeavors to visit each one at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has employed three teams of architects , mostly Italian and Dutch , to refinish and improve her castles . Each team moves from one to another , working at each about two years . She is constantly building , because she says that if One as powerful as God could afford to spend a whole week at His building , she can afford to spend a year or two at hers . She keeps , I believe , about a hundred and sixty servants here , not counting the gardeners or the stablemen , and they work at their jobs all year . But she is able to come here for only about four weeks in the summer , and in many years , as you might guess , she does n't get here at all . But she loves to travel . . . is on the go constantly . . . and has erected along all the major routes she uses , from one castle to the next , little homes  --  four rooms for her , two for the servants who live there the year round . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Poland , and years might slip by without her using this one or that one , but there it waits , always ready for her if she chances to pass by . '  |p258By  the end of the first enchanting week Feliks realized that it would require far more than six weeks for him to plumb the richness and the wonder of Lancut , but the greatest richness resided in the princess herself , and he was delighted to discover that she enjoyed talking with him , but he was also intelligent enough to know that she found pleasure in doing so because he was so naive , so uninstructed . ' My husband was a dear man , Feliks , but the Lubomirskis , God bless them , usually are . He was a gentleman , and it was through him that I inherited sixteen of my castles . I am especially proud of being a Czartoryska , and if what Goethe said of me is true , it 's because of the grinding education my father made me master . " Learn languages , you little idiot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to stay in Pulawy all your life . " What languages do you speak , Feliks ? ' When he revealed how impoverished he was , she lamented : Half your life gone . . . totally wasted . How can you ever be governor of Galicia if you ca n't speak good German in Vienna ? You know I spoke English to Franklin and Jefferson . ' ' Who are they ? ' To his surprise , she grasped him to her bosom and held his head against her throat for some moments . ' Blessed God , I wish I had a son like you , ' and while she still embraced him she said : ' All the energy I spend in building , and no one of either Lubomirski or Czartoryski to leave my empire to when I die . It is very painful , Feliks . ' During the ensuing weeks she kept Feliks close to her , instructing him in the ways of Polish society , and sometimes as she did so she spoke of the king : ' How miserable he must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaporate before his eyes . He was given the world to command .. . and will lose it all . ' Feliks could see her mouth grow tense as she told him vengefully : ' He started with so much . . . to end with so little . I with so little . . . to end with so much . ' It was obvious that she hated the king , but Feliks , obedient to Lubonski 's command , made no comment , nor did he tell Roman of his conversations with the great woman . Each day he spent in Roman Lubonski 's company he liked him more ; the young man was not at all slow-witted , as some had said , nor was he indifferent to evidences about him . He was merely quiet , thoughtful . ' Lubomirska frightens me , but then all women do , even my mother . ' He laughed quietly , then corrected himself : ' Especially my mother . She wants me to become some important figure and pesters me constantly with the fact that to do so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lookedp259sideways at Feliks and said hesitantly : You 're in love with Lubomirska , are n't you ? ' Feliks was . Like many ambitious young men before him , he had been swept away by his first acquaintance with a truly grand woman , for he could imagine the tremendous difference such a helpmeet would make , and this discovery encouraged him to compare his first two boyish loves with this dynamic , mature one : When Katarzyna Granicka and I rode across the steppe on our camels , I wished the world would go on like that forever , and when Nadzha was banished from her village , I knew my heart was breaking . But now that I see Lubomirska . . . You know , Roman , I think you 're in love with her , too . ' Have you ever watched a summer storm thundering down the Vistula from the mountains ? How it sweeps everything before it ? Even the small boats that are n't tied securely ? Lubomirska is like that . I 'm terrified of her , she 's so powerful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported from Krakowa company of some three dozen musicians , who would perform at the palace for three weeks : the best Jewish orchestra from that city , fourteen men in knee pants , black stockings and shoes , long black coats , flat hats and copious hair about their faces ; six German soloists who knew Mozart and Handel ; and sixteen other singers who could serve either as ' chorus or as soloists in a variety of forms . Now the palace was filled with music , and Feliks would sit in the splendid rooms in which it was played , his head back , his eyes following the ornate stucco work which decorated the ceilings : cupids and angels and lions and tigers , all without bodies , white-faced and staring down at the listeners . And there were times when the German soloists departed and the robust Polish singers took over with folk songs from Krakow ; then Lancut would ring with scores of voices joined together in a festival of song . At the conclusion of one such concert , Lubomirska obviously wanted to talk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions which had begun to gnaw at his conscience : Is it true , what Mam'selle told me , that you have nineteen castles like this one ? ' That is true . ' And that you keep three teams of architects busy , year after year ? ' We Czartoryskis are builders , Feliks . We find a corner of empty Polandand we build something on it . ' But sometimes you do n't visit one of your castles for years on end . '  |p260One  must also visit Paris and Vienna . And Rome and Venice . Have you ever been to those places ? ' Roman 's been to Vienna . He says it was a little city of great charm , hiding within gigantic walls . ' Sometimes walls save a city . Would to God we 'd had walls of some kind around Poland , we might have saved it , ' Is it true that you own more than a hundred and fifty thousand peasants ? ' Who knows ? ' Will they be set free . . . I mean one of these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free in France and England . ' Did your father tell you such things , Feliks ? ' He taught me about them . ' And such thinking got him killed , did n't it ? I wish you 'd fetch Ro-man . ' When the two young men sat with her in the gallery crowded with the marble statues of Greek and Roman heroes , including numerous Caesars , she told them : The most dangerous thing a young man can do when he 's trying to sort out the world is to apply a situation in one country to some other where it does n't apply . In your lifetimes you 'll hear many rumbles from France , and they may prove quite exciting , but not one of them applies to Poland , France is France , and her peasants are to be set free with pikes and staves in their hands , killing their betters . Poland is Poland , divided into three and soon I think to disappear forever because of our stupid king . ' Feliks could not restrain the question which fermented : Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this great woman who should have been Poniatowski 's queen said : I despise any man who could have become something powerful , and failed . If events crush him the way Hamlet and Macbeth were overwhelmed . . . all right . Or if evil forces bring him down the way Othello fell . . all right again . But to fail because of one 's own temerity . . What is temerity ? ' Feliks asked , but she ignored him . Turning to Roman , she grabbed his two hands and shook them vigorously . If you , young man , could be an officer of the Habsburg court in Vienna and fail to grasp the opportunity , or to perform well if you do grasp it . . . ' She thrust his hands away . I will be watching from heaven , and I 'll be ashamed of you . ' But Feliks persisted : Will your peasants be set free ? ' and she repliedp261evasively : Wolfgang von Goethe was the most brilliant man I ever met , master of the universe . But Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never liked Tom Jefferson much  --  too revolutionary , too scientific and inhuman . And each one of these exceptional men told me that for the present , some kind of serfdom was inescapable : slavery in America , peasants in Poland . If America thinks it can end its slavery , it will perish . The day when serfs are set free in Poland , it will perish . ' Seems to me , ' Feliks said , it 's already perishing . ' I mean the real Poland . . . the countryside . . . what you see here , whether it 's ruled by Austria or Russia , it goes on and on . ' ' Will Lancut go on and on ? ' Feliks asked , and now she grasped his two hands , saying sternly : You ask dangerous questions , young man , and if you persist , you will end in an Austrian prison or a Russian mine . With France in flames and America inviting others to mimic her revolution , the rulers of these parts are not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be gunned down in the streets of Warsaw to prevent revolt . ' At the height of the musical festivities , when more than sixty guests crowded the castle bedrooms , two horsemen galloped in from the east with the exciting news that Kleofas Granicki was riding west with his camels at the whirlwind conclusion of his investigations in the Ukraine ; in addition to this information , they handed Lubomirska a written message , which she crumpled with joy , shouting : Yes ! Yes ! ' And for the rest of that day there was vast excitement at the palace , with the hundred and fifty servants dashing about inside and the forty-seven gardeners raking the lawns outside and gathering huge garlands of summer flowers . Three teams of rural musicians were sent for  --  bagpipes , fiddle , drum  --  and the many cooks were put to baking . Lubomirska would not reveal what had been in Granicki 's note , but on the morning of the next day , when the wild man arrived at the head of six cameleers firing their rifles , Feliks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight gaily decorated camels drew a huge , improvised wagon through the palace gates , bearing inside a young couple who were obviously to be married at Lancut . It was the lovely Katarzyna Granicka and the handsome , witty young Ryszard Lubomirski , who had been denuded at Radzyn Castle . They formed an imposing pair , she seventeen , he twenty-three , inheritors of power and wealth , and Feliks was not the least bit envious . Years and years ago , it seemed , he had loved Katarzyna for one reverberating spring when flowers filled the steppe , but now he was so infinitely olderp262and wiser that she seemed like an unformed little girl whom he wished well . To Roman he said , as the couple passed in their flower-packed wagon : ' I thought you would marry her , ' to which young Lubonski replied : Two years from now I would . ' As was fitting in such surroundings , the wedding was a sumptuous affair , but it was also the occasion for an unusual performance to surprise and amuse the guests . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was not of his family , but of her dead husband 's , and thus it was proper for him to borrow Lancut palace as the site for his festivities . At the big dinner on the evening prior to the wedding , when Katarzyna was not allowed to be present , young Lubomirski appeared in old-style Polish dress . ' I wear this in honor of my father-in-law , Kleofas , and out of respect for his ideals . ' He bowed low toward where the old warrior was sitting , then to the astonishment of all , he began to undress , right where he stood , and when he was down to the briefest possible underclothes he whistled for his servant , who brought in a stack of French-style dress , and ceremoniously he donned one item after another until he stood forth a handsome young fellow who would have been at home in either Paris or London . Gravely he lifted from the floor the old dress , placing each piece on the extended arms of his servant , and when the pile was complete he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must obey your daughter 's wishes . ' And he again bowed low . It was in the noisy conversation which followed this daring act that Feliks Bukowski first , heard the name of Tadeusz Kosciuszko ; Kleofas Granicki was bellowing : ' I heard from St. Petersburg that our young hero Kosciuszko is making an ass of himself in Paris . ' Not surprising , ' Lubomirska said . ' He was totally corrupted in Amer-ica . ' What 's he up to ? ' an Austrian baron asked . Kleofas had imperfect reports : He 's fighting , of course . . . he 's alwaysfighting for some cause or other . He supports the revolution and may even be a general in it . ' That poor fool , ' Lubomirska said with real sorrow . ' He comes from a good family , you know . Was desolated by the First Partition in 1772 . Went to America . . . fell in with men like Tom Jefferson , whom I never liked  --  ' The Austrian baron , an officer in the Habsburg cavalry , interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right-hand man  --  engineering , fortifications , things like that . ' ' Can the American experiment last long ? ' Granicki asked . ' No , ' the Austrian said , and in this manner Kosciuszko was dismissed . At the end of the sixth week of the Lubonski visit , Princess Lubomirskastarted her servants on the task of packing for her departure ; she would move on to her great castle at Wisnicz , which she had not visited during the past three years and where one hundred and sixty servants and thirty-eight gardeners awaited her arrival . The last concerts were given  --  sixteen separate arias from Mozart operas , backed by the entire chorus  --  and a last tour of the ninety major European paintings was made , with Lubomirska herself explaining to the two young men why this artist was first class and that one not . The endless flower vases were wrapped in cloth and stored , and the machines that delivered water to the nine spouting fountains were halted . There were tears as different groups of the sixty guests departed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Count , give the Mniszechs my love . Roman and Feliks , find yourselves good wives . Goodbye , goodbye , and may we remember this glorious summer when the music played . ' She walked with them to where they mounted their horses and pulled each man down for a farewell kiss , for she suspected that she might not return to Lancut for several years , her problems at the rebuilding of her other castles and palaces requiring her attention . The Lubonski company rode diligently in a southwesterly direction for several days , making far less progress than before , since now they were entering the low foothills of the Carpathian Mountains , but as the first cold winds of autumn struck at them ' from the south , they came to the ancient town of Dukla guarding the passes into Hungary . The young men were almost disappointed in what they found , for the ancestral seat of the mighty Mniszech clan was a shabby affair , neither bold and big like the Granicki castle nor sumptuous like Lancut . It was a frontier fortress occupied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance , for as Count Lubonski warned his charges when they rode up to the gloomy affair : ' Without the Mniszechs down here wrestling with Hungary and Russia , there 'd have been no Poland . ' And he remindedthem that Cyprjan Lubonski , the first to wear the title Count , had been vastly aided by his youthful marriage to Zofia Mniszech , who had more or less established the style of the Lubonskis and had motheredp264the unforgettable Barbara who perished in the fall of Krzyztopor : The Mniszechs are a notable family , and if their young Elzbieta is as lovely as they say , we will have made a good journey . ' Alas , Elzbieta was not in residence ; she had traveled with her father , Ignacy , to a remote castle on the Hungarian frontier , where the Lubonskiswere invited to follow after due rest at Dukla . Obviously the young men , excited by reports of Elzbieta 's beauty and liveliness , were disappointed , but the enforced layover in Dukla turned out to be one of the high points of their journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , Urszula , widow of a great warrior , who told stories of her family with all the ardor and joy that Sophocles and Aeschylus had shown when telling of the House of Atreus . She was in her sixties that autumn , and for five enchanted weeks she narrated wild and glowing accounts of what the Mniszechs had done when they wandered into Poland out of the Czech lands , of how they had battled bears with their hands , and fought against the Russians , and then with the Russians against the Tatars , but always , to the delight of the young men , she returned to stories featuring the young women of the clan , whom she referred to in the feminine form of their name , Mniszchowna , and she pronounced this with such mystery , clothing the women in romances so alluring , that Roman and Feliks had to conclude : A Mniszchowna must be irresistible . In 1589 , Jerzy Mniszech and his wife , Jadwiga , who was born a Tarlowna , gave birth to a beautiful child they christened Maryna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these mountains . Her fame was widespread and men drew portraitsof her . One fell into the hands of the youth who was to be the Czar of Russia , Dmitri by name , although there were some who called him False Dmitri because his claim to the throne was contested by Boris Godunov . This Dmitri , always seeking the throne , came here to Dukla , lured by the portrait he had seen of Maryna , and in this little town Maryna 's uncles and brothers and men of the Tarlows schemed to make him czar , and believe it or not , they succeeded , and he became Czar of All the Russias , and in grand ceremonies at Krakow , attended by kings and princes from Europe , he married our Maryna , and she became czarina , at the age of fifteen . Short happiness . There was an evil Russian called Princep265Shuiski who wanted to be czar , so after less than two years he assassinated Dmitri , and our poor Maryna was left a defenseless widow in Moscow . But a beautiful woman is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maryna did . She found another young prince , also named Dmitri , who also claimed to be czar , the first Dmitri having been little less than a fraud . ' So our Maryna married this second Dmitri , and for the second time she reigned as czarina , but this one , too , was assassinated , so that Prince Shuiski regained the throne , but if I remember right , he was also assassinated . Ugly things happen in Russia . ' ' What happened to Maryna ? ' Feliks asked , and Urszula 's eyes glowed with delight at what she must report next : Alone , widowed , heartbroken with grief , Maryna met a Cossackhetman and ran away with him into the steppes of Russia , where together they planned a big rebellion , but it never amounted to much , As I recall , they were captured by the real czar 's army , a Romanoff I think , and Maryna and her Cossack were taken back to Moscow and beheaded publicly . But she was a true Mniszech and spat at them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges : Much of what she said was true , you know . Maryna was czarina twice , and I think she did run away with the Cossack , but I doubt she was beheaded . ' ' What else was false ? ' Feliks asked . ' Her beauty . I 've seen portraits of her , from that time , and she had two rather big warts . Also , she was quite small . When the czar 's soldiers tried to arrest her the first time , she huddled down and hid herself under the skirts of her nurse . ' ' You spoiled the story , ' Roman protested , and his father said : ' I believed it when my mother , who had Mniszech blood , told it to me . You choose what part you want to accept , because in essence it 's true . ' Urszula never mentioned a Mniszech woman without assuring her listeners that the subject of her tale was extraordinarily beautiful , so thatRoman and Feliks came to accept this as an essential characteristic of thefamily . ' I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Josef Mniszech and a different Tarlowna , married Josef Potocki , and you must keep these names straight , for another Potocki , not ap266very nice one , comes along later . Ludwika was the most beautifulgirl in these parts and painters drew portraits of her which show her to be quite heavenly , a word I use with careful meaning . The young couple went to live at the big castle north of Przemysl , I always forget the name , and one day when Ludwika was in the bell tower , though why she was there I could never understand , a horseman came dashing into the courtyard , which is as big as all of Dukla , crying : " The young master is killed . He fell from his horse and is killed ! " With a scream of despair Ludwika threw herself from the bell tower and died . Now , at midnight when there 's a full moon , she stalks the towers of Krasiczyn , I remember the name now , dressed in flowing robes and mourning the death of her beloved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potocki was n't dead at all . He rode back home as good as you or me , buried his wife , and promptly married an Ossolinska , I believe it was , and she and he lived in the castle very happily , I 'm told . ' Count Lubonski said with some pride : I believe our castle at Gorka is the only one in Poland that does n't have a female ghost in a filmy gown walking the battlements at midnight . Lubonski women are too clever to waste their time that way . If you ask me , they probably stay close to heaven , listening to good music and drinking mead . ' But was her story true ? ' Roman asked . They were real people . We passed by their castle on our way to Lwow . ' ' I should like to believe it was true , ' Roman said , and his father replied : ' I 'm quite pleased with you on this trip , Roman . Young men ought to believe  --  in the Crucifixion , in the goodness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases help you to sort things out . ' That 's the second time you 've used that phrase , ' Roman said , and his father replied : I 've spent my life trying to sort things out . ' Have you succeeded ? ' ' No . I 've lived in an age of disaster . And I came here to Dukla to talk about it with Ignacy Mniszech . I 'm terribly disappointed about his absence , and I think we should move west to catch him at Niedzica . ' I 'd like to stay here . These tales captivate me . ' And Feliks said that he , too , was enjoying himself , so they lingered , hoping each day that Elzbieta would return , and it was fortunate that they did , for this enabled them top267hear from Urszula a harrowing tale of events that had occurred in the last generation of Mniszechs : Jerzy August , who was the brother of that Ludwika who threw herself from the bell tower at the castle , he took his second wife , a rich and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great Bruhl family that came into Poland with our Saxon kings , amassing huge fortunes from the careless Poles . Well , Maria Amalia was like a bolt of lightning . I knew her well and was terrified by her . German this and German that , but beautiful and able . She had a daughter Jozefa of my age , and I adored her . Intelligent , she could read before any of us . Traveled to Italy and could sing like a bird . I was in this room when her parents announced that she was to marry the most dashing man in the countryside , Szczesny Potocki , and there was great feasting , I can tell you , for this was a match made in heaven . Mniszechmoney and Potocki lands . But before the wedding could take place , this bastard man Szczesny falls in love with a rather attractive daughter of a minor gentry , Gertruda Komorowska , miles and miles inferior to our Jozefina . He married her , insulting all of Dukla , and he got her pregnant , very big pregnant I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we Mniszechs would tolerate , and especially when Maria Amalia Bruhl with German stubbornness was involved . So one night when pregnant Gertrudawas returning home in a sleigh , a gang of Cossacks hired by Maria Amalia dashed out , stopped the horses , dragged the pregnant wife onto the snow , strangled her , cut off her head , and pitched her body into the San River . That taught her to steal a husband intended for the Mniszechs . ' Roman , obsessed by the history of this violent family , asked what followed , and the old woman rocked back and forth , savoring the gory details of an affair in which she had participated : Mniszech men , indebted to the Cossacks , gave their leader , Berezow , one of their villages in the Ukraine and two thousand extra serfs . His son became Count Berezowski and married one of the Potocki girls . But the interesting part is that the same Mniszech men forced the disgraceful Szczesny Potocki to marry our Jozefina , as originally intended , and Maria Amalia told himp268at the wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangle him . ' Well , the Komorowskis were pretty distressed by this whole affair , as you might imagine . . . their beautiful daughter strangled by a bunch of Cossacks and she with child . They brought suit in the Krakow courts for revenge , but the Mniszechswere too powerful . Our side bought off the judges , my husband delivering the money , and the Komorowskis were told in effect to go to hell . ' The Komorowskis were not powerless , and although they were not of senior category , they were gentry , so one night three of their young men , I knew them all , crept into the home of Szczesny Potocki and killed our Jozefina . Killed her dead . ' Maria Amalia Bruhl thought for a while that maybe Potocki himself had killed her , and she warned him : " If you ever remarry , you dog , I will personally strangle your wife . " I think this scared him , for he never remarried . Instead he took up with a beautiful Greek dancer named Zofya and they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entranced by this story , but Feliks expressed some doubts , which infuriated Urszula , who took him by the hand and led him , with Roman following , to a roughly built but imposing stone church , Santa Maria Magdalena , which dominated Dukla 's central square . In its largestchapel she sat Feliks down on a bench from which he could study a professionally carved sarcophagus which stood against a wall . On its base of black marble reposed the gleaming white recumbent statue of Countess Maria Amalia Mniszchowna , dead at the age of thirty-six , the mother of four children . Across her placid face drifted a benign Christian smile . ' There lies one of the most powerful women I was ever to know , ' Urszula said . ' Harsh at times but very capable . ' ' Is Elzbieta like her ? ' Roman asked , and Urszula replied : ' All Mniszechwomen are like her . ' The journey from Dukla well west to Niedzica was an experience totally different from any the young men had previously experienced , for the rugged pathway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at times seemed impassable . Feliks , noting with grow/ing interest the altered terrain , told Roman one evening as the sun sank behind hills : Old Urszula 's yarns were a good preparation for land like this , ' to which Roman snapped : They were n't yarns . They happened . ' And it was he who now rode ahead to catch the first glimpse of each new and exciting vista . Roman was in this preferred position when they entered a picturesque gorge , which apparently was going to run deep into the mountains , and he signaled for Feliks to join him , so that together the two young men led the way into terrain which offered constant surprises : now a sheer wall , now a tumbling rapids in the river whose bank they were following . A local guide employed by the count to lead them through the forbidding land told the young men : Any merchant traveling from Budapest to Krakow must pass along this route , so bandits have always infested our area . They 're still here today , even though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have soldiers with us , whssssst ! Out of those hills they 'd come and cut our throats . ' Hoping that bandits would attack , so that gunfire would explode about them , the explorers hurried ahead , and as they rounded a bend in the tumbling river Roman cried : There they are ! ' and in the distance , perched on two massive hills , one to the north of the river , the other to the south , rose the twin castles of Niedzica , forming a unique and stunningsight . Had these castles stood in some accessible spot , they would have been famous throughout Europe ; hidden away in this remote gorge , they were legends spoken of with respect by all who had actually enjoyed their hospitality . The Lubonski party rode for half a day with the castles in view , and when they were so close that Roman thought a human voice would alert the inhabitants , the guide discharged a volley , at which men appeared on the ramparts of the southern castle to fire back , and a lively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while people began to emerge from the castle , a great train of them , men and women alike , and as they proceeded down a steep footpath to the river 's edge , both of the young men thought : Elzbieta Mniszech is among them , and they began to strain their eyes for a sight of her . Since the pathway up the gorge had followed the north bank of the river , the travelers would have to use a ferry to reach the Niedzica castle on the south , and as they rode up to a rude departure area , four shallow skiffs poled by mountaineers in heavy felt jackets started across the river to fetch them . As soon as the count and his two young charges stepped gingerly into the first skiff , there was much gunfire and shouting from thep270castle side , and as the skiffs were brought to shore , Roman and Feliks stared at their waiting hosts , who now crowded the landing area . That 's Ignacy Mniszech , ' Lubonski told them , pointing to a huge man with long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style , and that smaller man in green-and-gold jacket is Horvath Janos , the Hungarian who owns the castle . And remember that they give their last names first , so do n't call him Pan Horvath . ' There were four other large men with heads shaved almost clean , and a larger number dressed in the distinctive fashion of Hungary . Halfway up the stairs leading to the castle waited sixteen soldiers in green uniforms , and far beyond them , some hundred feet higher , began the castle walls . And then the young suitors saw standing in the shadow of Ignacy his daughter Elzbieta , twenty years old , dressed in a Hungarian peasant costume adorned with heavy braid and wearing big clumsy fur boots . Like most of the Mniszechs , she had dark hair and fair complexion , and as soon as the young men identified her , they both saw her as , the next in line of heroic and romantic Mniszech women , but that was perplexing because this one looked as if she was gentle and soft-spoken . When she became aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her father . A confused bustle developed as the Hungarian gentlemen reached down to help the visitors disembark over the frail , narrow boards that were thrown out from shore to the edges of the skiffs , and when one of Lubonski 's men slipped into the water , not deeply , there were cheers . Ignacy himself reached out to grab for Roman , and after he pulled the young man safely ashore he gave him a huge bear hug and a kiss on the forehead : Welcome to Niedzica , young man , and this is my daughter Elzbieta . ' Not shyly , for she was a mature woman but with a lovely reserve , Elzbieta extended her two hands and grasped Roman 's , and later when she did the same with Feliks that young man realized as if in a blinding flash that he was at last in love . Katarzyna Granicka had been attractive in the general way that all young women are , and Nadzha the Ukrainian without a name had been deeply moving , and the great Lubomirska had been a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long journey , and he knew that as long as he lived he would love no other . In his instantaneous infatuation , and perhaps not so instantaneous , for it had been kindled by the preparatory legends of old Urszula , he quite forgot that the more important Roman Lubonski was also looking for a wife and that Roman had been as deeply affected as he.  |p271The  next days were enchanted , for this Niedzica castle contained seven round towers , each topped with battlements from which one could look down upon the gorge or across to the northern castle , standing upon its own rocky prominence , and occasionally one could see a caravan of horses slowly following the river on its way to Krakow , and once as Roman and Feliks watched , Elzbieta came to stand with them at the top of the highest tower . Right there '  --  she pointed  --  is where the robbers strike if the merchants are caught in the gorge at night . ' Have you ever seen it happen ? ' Feliks asked . No , it comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one night while we were sleeping . Two Austrian Jews left dead . ' Like her great-aunt Urszula , she was a storyteller , and her account of things that had happened in these twin castles kept the young men bewitched , for she spoke in a soft voice , allowing it to rise in excitement as she approached important climaxes : My uncle said that these twin castles , remote though they are , summarize Polish history . When the Tatars swept the land in 1241 , the frightened Duke of Krakow fled here for hiding . And have you ever heard of Jadwiga , the glorious Hungarian princesswho married Jagiello ? When she entered Poland to become our queen . . . here 's where she slept on her first night in our country . Our last Swedish king , Jan Kazimir , came hiding here during the Deluge , and my uncle thinks it was here that the grand Jerzy Lubomirski hid the royal treasury when the Swedes conquered everything . One of the False Dmitris hid here , too , before he became czar , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I first saw the castles I thought : My God , this is the end of the world . But it was often the center . And now here we are , at the end or the center , who knows ? ' When snow fell , the area became a silent wonderland , with deer moving down from the hills and ice immobilizing the skiffs . Then everyone stayed in the great halls , with fires crackling and stories echoing . Ignacy Mniszech dominated whatever was under way , a huge opinionated man , his head glistening in the firelight , his mustaches threatening anyone who disagreed with him : By God , it would be better for us all if Russia tookp272over what 's left , and the part Austria has , too . Catherine knows how to rule . ' Feliks noted that at such moments , without ever raising his own voice , Count Lubonski resisted Ignacy 's arguments : ' I think we 'll find , in the long run , that Austria is going to govern its part of Poland much better than either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice growing louder and louder , Lubonski patiently rebutted his arguments , and when he was alone with the young men he reminded them : ' The Mniszechs have always been in the pay of Russia . He has to say what he does . ' Ignacy looked at his best one snowy day when someone suggested a bear hunt in the nearby hills . ' Are n't bears asleep now ? ' Feliks asked , at which Mniszech bellowed : ' They are , and it 'll be our job to wake them up . When the hunt was organized  --  enough gentry and soldiers to storm a castle  --  Elzbieta announced that she would join it , and at first her father said angrily that she should stay home with the cooks and be damned , but when she persisted , he awakened to the fact that she was eager to be with the young men , to observe how they behaved , and he gave her a huge hug , crying : ' If you get your pretty face clawed , that 's your fault . ' Feliks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ignacy , ' and the leader of the hunt roared : ' You better ! ' Feliks could still not understand how there could be a bear hunt when there were no bears , but when they were far into the woods and up the side of a mountain , Ignacy called for the brands , and when they were well lighted and throwing smoke , he climbed into several dangerous spots from which he thrust the brands into caves that might contain hibernatingbears , and after three disappointments , which left his hands and one side of his face scratched , he found a cave which he judged to be especiallypromising . Calling for more brands , he stuffed their smoking ends into the entrance , and after a while he shouted : ' By God , a bear ! ' And from the cave , sleepy and distraught , emerged a large brown bear who took one look at Mniszech and retreated in terror , but his caverefugewas now so filled with smoke that he could not enter it , so in desperation he shied away from Mniszech and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild shouts , armed men loosed their dogs and started in pursuit , with Roman and Feliks making a way for Elzbieta , who reveled in the chase . For about a mile the bear kept ahead of his pursuers , but he was emaciated from his long sleep without food , and in the end he tired sop273pitifully that the dogs had an easy time with him , sinking their sharp teeth into his flanks , and with four of the dogs tormenting him in this way and making any further progress impossible , the weak creature turned to face his encircling enemies . With wide swipes of first one forepaw and then the other , he punished some of the dogs , sending them away withagonized yelps and bleeding faces , but always the men moved closer , and , in the end Ignacy lunged forward with a long pike , transfixing the bear with a mortal thrust . Feliks felt sick at his stomach and showed it . He did not perform well , either , on the night soldiers trapped two bandits as they attacked peddlers moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbers were dragged into the castle , their pockets still crammed with the goods they had stolen , soldiers were encouraged to beat them , and Feliks protested : They killed no one . ' They probably killed those two Jews last month , ' Mniszech stormed , and the beatings continued , to Feliks ' disgust . He was ill-prepared for what happened at dawn . Bugles sounded and everyone in the castle assembled in the large square subtended by the towers , where a rude platform had been erected , hastily rather than sturdily . It wobbled when one of the soldiers with an axe mounted , and when the first of the robbers was shoved onto it the props almost fell . ' Hold them up ! ' Mniszech cried , and three soldiers were assigned to each pole to keep it steady . They failed , and when the man with the axe tried to chop off the head of the first robber , the neck moved and he bungled the job horribly . The second robber , aware that he was going to be treated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the third ineffectual time , and fainted . Feliks almost did the same , but he steeled himself to look as the inert body of the second robber was lifted onto the rickety platform , where the man with the axe prepared to decapitate him . Do it right , ' Mniszech bellowed , or you 're next . ' Since it was entirely possible that this threat might be carried out , the executioner 's hand trembled visibly , but with two powerful and ill-directed blows he managed to sever the head . Feliks could watch no longer , a fact which Elzbieta noted with approval , for she , too , had turned away . In the week after Christmas , Feliks showed to excellent advantage , for all in the castle journeyed to a small town nearby , where snow in the narrow streets had been packed flat by the feet of many peasants and where teams of swift horses had been harnessed to sleighs of an extraordinarynature . They were so narrow that only one person , always anp274unmarried girl , could find a place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in back as a kind of platform from which the driver , always an unmarried young man , would direct the horses with long reins and an even longer whip of extreme flexibility made in France . The ride through the narrow streets was not a race , because two sleighs could not run side by side , but it was nevertheless a test of competitive skill , because each driver whipped his horses to their top speed , with the girl hanging on desperately and forbidden to scream , regardless of what happened . Often the tiny sleighs , little more than a foot wide , upset , throwing the girl into a snowbank , and sometimes horses in the following sleighs had to leap over her ; this was a discredit to her driver , who must keep his sleigh upright no matter what . Roman Lubonski flatly refused to engage in this perilous sport , for once he had seen a girl disfigured , and his father did not press him to change his mind , for such rides were a Cossack invention and a fallback to more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Elzbieta as his partner , jumped forward to volunteer , and he was given a sleigh with the painted name Firebird , and on its narrow seat he placed Elzbieta , assuring her they would win this competition . Heart galloping like his horses , Feliks whipped his team into the narrow streets , kept them roaring around the corners , waved to the watchers , and headed for the critical passage in which two sudden turns were required . Hold on ! ' he warned Elzbieta , and with a skill that astonished the mountain people , who were unaware of his love for horses , he negotiated the dangerous twists and brought his narrow sled and its precious cargo safely home . The crowd applauded and Roman ran up to shake Feliks ' hand , but he was prevented from doing so by Elzbieta , who reached up at this moment to give her driver a triumphal kiss . We did it ! ' she cried . It was so wonderful , the frightening curves . ' Again she kissed him , but then she saw Roman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd have fallen off if he had n't warned , just at the bad part , " Hold on ! " ' Together the three walked back to where Mniszech and the count waited to applaud them . Two days after New Year 's , men whom Feliks had not seen before and whom Roman did not know either , arrived at Niedzica from two differentdirections . From Vienna came Count von Starhemberg , descendant of that brave Austrian who had helped defend Vienna against the Turks ; the twin castles and all the territory around them were now Austrian property , and Feliks supposed that he had come to inspect it . He was ap275young man with a sense of command , and Feliks guessed that he was intended for some superior post in the Habsburg government . The other man was more perplexing : Baron Ottokar von Eschl of Prussia , in his sixties , reserved and proper , and impatient with the normalsocial niceties . When Elzbieta was presented to him he barely acknowledgedher , and he ignored completely her two suitors , for obviouslyhe wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this remote spot . But what that business was , Feliks could not guess . At the large dinner that launched the unusual meeting , with snow swirling about the parapets and the fires crackling , Von Eschl attracted the young men 's attention by speaking almost disrespectfully to Count Lubonski : Why ca n't you Poles discipline this fool Kosciuszko ? If he continues , he 's going to make serious trouble . ' We hold him in no regard , Baron , ' Lubonski said with obvious conviction . But if he keeps talking over your heads . . . exciting the peasants  --  ' Mniszech broke in : If the peasants make one move , we 'll crush them the way Catherine crushed hers . ' And no more was said . During the following days , while Mniszech and Lubonski met long hours with the two visitors , Feliks Bukowski was left alone to ponder the various shreds of information he had gathered on this disturbing trip , because if his four love affairs had been disorienting , his experience with the problems of Poland had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the son of a man who had given his life to preserve Polish freedom , and Feliks knew precisely what his father 's definition of freedomhad been : Feliks , the time has come when we must move like France and England and America . The freedom of fifteen great families to dictate in all fields is n't good enough any longer . Men should own land . They should work for themselves , not for some castle , and they should pay taxes to the government , not to some damned fool like Przamowski . ' Feliks would never forget Przamowski , of the petty gentry in a nearby village . By evey device known in Poland he extracted labor and money from his serfs , charging them duties , which the Bukowskis never did . Przamowski had his own grinding mill , which his peasants must use for an exorbitant fee , and his own brewery , which his serfs had to patronize . One hot summer a peasant in one of Przamowski 's cottages refused to buy his ration of beer because neither he nor his wife liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You owe me for three gallons ! ' And when the peasant said : But we do n't drink beer , '  |p276Przamowski  in a rage poured the beer on the ground at the man 's doorstep . Now , goddamn you , you have your beer and I want my zlotys , ' and the man had to pay . Feliks could not shake out of his mind his memories of Lancut palace , the endless rooms used a few weeks every other year , the battalions of servants , the gardeners picking at individual pieces of grass , the eighteen other palaces and the teams of architects perfecting them for visitors who never came . He could see that row of sixty faces about the long table , the faces of men and women who had used Poland to their private advantage , and he began to wonder what the phrase Golden Freedom really meant . At first he had been disposed to accept Granicki 's judgment that Poland had known greatness only because the magnates ruled it well , but he knew that those days were gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions were required . Because he held Count Lubonski in such high regard , he had once been prepared to believe that all magnates were like him , but now that he was seeing others at close quarters , he began to suspect that they had always been a robust , thieving , selfcenteredlot who had given Poland not good government but one of the poorest in Europe . They were eager to defend their country against powerless robbers who lurked in river gorges , but extremely loath to protect it against real robbers like Prussia and Russia , who were invited to conduct their depredations openly . He had no clear concept at this time of who Tadeusz Kosciuszko might be , but the several things he had heard about the man excited him : he was a patriot who opposed the partitions ; he had acquired fresh new ideas in France and America ; and he seemed to support the kind of freedom for which Tytus had died . I think I would like Kosciuszko , ' he told Roman , and the young man replied : Better not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulated these tentative evaluations the men at table spent more than an hour extolling the Golden Freedom , and they made such a good case that Feliks was confused . Count Lubonski remindedhis listeners : ' When France was burning the Albigensian heretics , no fire was ever lit in Poland . When England crucified Jews , they lived free in Poland . When religious wars swept over Germany , one horrible decimation after another , Poland remained a bastion of freedom . My father , may God grant him respite , did authorize the beheadingsat Torun , but even he was ashamed and they were never repeated . Freedom did mean freedom for all . ' It was a remarkable contribution to European government , ' Baronp277von Eschl agreed . ' A nation without a large standing army . A parliament in which the freedom of the intellectual few was protected against the rule of the mob . The constant cultivation of the best families , who ruled with supreme wisdom . Small wonder Russia and Austria and Prussia have always rallied to protect that freedom . ' When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Von Starhemberg said , ' I concluded that Poland offered the finest democracy since ancient Athens . The people ruled , not the king . You allowed no dictatorship , no savage rule . In its day your Golden Freedom lit a beacon for the world , and that 's why Vienna has always been first to protect it . ' On and on the encomiums went , until Feliks gained the impression that it must have been Poles who had organized the two partitions , because obviously Austria , Prussia and Russia had fought constantly to defend her . But one afternoon when he was looking for Elzbieta , who was spendingmore and more of her time with Roman , he passed an open door and heard the four men  --  Von Eschl , Von Starhemberg , Mniszech and Lubonski  --  arguing heatedly , and like any inquisitive young man , he lingered . Mniszech was saying : Fyodor Kuprin came to me at my estate in west Russia and assured me that his Catherine was now reconciled to terminating Poland . Wiping it out altogether and forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first move ? ' She will if Austria joins us . ' We can not trust a vague promise like that , ' Von Eschl said , at which Mniszech flared : Are you doubting my word ? ' and Von Eschl said : ' I am doubting Catherine 's . She has lied to us too often in the past . ' Feliks could not follow what was said next , for everyone spoke at once , but finally Von Eschl 's cold , clear voice , always cutting to the heart of the matter , asked : Von Starhemberg , tell us in the simplest possible terms , will Austria join us in a final partition ? ' Before the Viennese count could reply , Lubonski said in a voice so low that Feliks could scarcely hear him : Horvath Janos assured me on the day I came that he had representations from Vienna promising immediatemilitary support if Russia and Prussia chose to make a final move . ' And you have Catherine 's and Kuprin 's promise that Russia is ready to take the leap . ' Von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhear us , and I do not want Horvath to know what we 're deciding . ' And the door was slammed.  |p278In  great confusion of spirit Feliks dropped his speculation about Poland 's freedom and directed his whole attention to the courtship of Elzbieta Mniszech ; for two weeks Roman had enjoyed a fairly free field , but Feliks now proved himself a formidable contestant . He was not shy ; he spoke well ; each day he was acquiring additional sophistication , and although he was somewhat shorter than Roman , he was more pleasing in overall appearance . He was also infatuated with Elzbieta and had reason to believe that she was attracted to him . Twice she referred to the sleigh ride at which he had performed so ably and several times she allowed herself to be trapped in corners of the castle , where they kissed passionately . Once when they lingered there for the better part of an hour , caressing each other , she broke into tears . ' Oh , Feliks , you 're going to be a man any girl would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpret this , but the more he talked with her the more convinced he became that she was a rare creature : beautiful , compassionate , gifted in four languages , and wise . For one rich and glorious week he imagined himself married to her , and when he wakened from this dream he found her waiting for him in a corridor leading to one of the battlements , and they went out into the wintry air , where snow made the mountains and the gorges one gleaming beauty . Rarely could young people have been in love in a setting more conducive to wild feelings and bold imaginings , for the entire world seemed to lie at their feet . ' I am going to ask Pan Ignacy for your hand , ' Feliks said , whereupon Elzbieta kissed him ardently , but then she began to tremble as if the cold had attacked her , and he asked if she wished to leave the exposed spot and the whistling winds . ' Oh , no ! ' she cried , clutching at his arm . ' It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father will say . ' ' I think he likes me . ' ' He does . He 's told me so . ' ' He did ? ' But I think . . . I 'm afraid , that is . . . I think he has hoped I would marry Roman . ' Once she uttered this fear , Feliks understood how real it was ; Count Lubonski had come to Niedzica not only to discuss Poland 's future with the executioners but also to find a family alliance for his diffident son Roman , and with the Granicki girl already married , Elzbieta became notp279only an attractive prospect but perhaps the sole one . Roman , with his distinctive lineage as a real magnate , was a formidable opponent and Feliks thought it best to confront the situation openly : ' Are you in love with Roman ? ' ' I 'm in love with you , surely you know that . ' Will you marry me ? ' he blurted out . She blushed , held his hand tightly , and then kissed him as they leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think , Feliks , you had better let me speak to Father about that . ' ' It 's my duty to speak , ' he said , feeling the ardor of her hand loosen into fear . ' It 's always the man 's duty . ' ' The Mniszechs are different , ' she warned . ' If Father is angered . . ' I would not be afraid , ' he said with sharp finality , and she shrugged her shoulders and said : ' Speak to him , then . ' So they descended from the tower to seek him out , and from the manner in which she stayed close to Feliks , it was apparent that she intended supporting him in his supplication . They found Ignacy in deep consultation with Baron von Eschl , the two men leaning over a map and drawing lines which now and then they scrubbed out , and although Feliks was loath to interrupt , Elzbieta went right up to her father , saying : ' Can we speak with you , please ? ' Von Eschl smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak about , for he had been watching the young people and knew fairly accurately what had been happening . Folding the map four times and placing a heavy book upon it , he left the room . ' Father , we wish to ask you a question , ' Elzbieta said , reaching out for her lover 's hand to lend him support , but as Feliks stepped forward to make his speech , Ignacy Mniszech moved forward too , and he seemed enormous , a giant that leaned forward like the cliffs of a river gorge , with a stare so intense that Feliks feared he might lash out with his huge fists . Instead , his huge face broke into a warm , compassionate smile , and before Feliks could utter a word , he felt his two hands being caught in Ignacy 's and clasped with passionate warmth . ' You were wise to come to me , Feliks . It 's what a gentleman should do , and I appreciate your courtesy . ' Dropping the hands , he threw a bearlike paw about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room without allowing him to have said one sentence , and as soon as the couple were at the door they could hear him bellowing : ' Von Eschl ! Find the Austrian and let 's get back to work . ' ' I think he accepted the idea , ' Feliks said hopefully as he led Elzbietap280along the stony corridors of this historic castle , and she agreed with him : ' There 's hope . ' But he said nothing , ' Feliks reflected , and with these words he could feel Elzbieta grow curiously distant , a sensation which intensified when they met Roman coming in from a morning hunt . In some unstated way she had dissociated herself from Feliks and moved closer to Roman , and it was then that Feliks began to suspect that there might be some arrangementbetween his two friends and between Elzbieta and her father , so that words between the latter pair had been unnecessary . Seeing this excellent girl in morning light , detached from him as it were , he realized what an exceptional person she was , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brave , as she had shown at the sleigh ride ; she was warm and affectionate , as her kisses had amply demonstrated ; and she had strong character , as when she summoned her father from his work with the German baron ; and she was as beautiful as a fawn in early summer when every meadow is an invitation to leaping and exploring . Elzbieta , he whispered to himself , if the answer is no , I think I shall die . Ignacy Mniszech himself went into the kitchen to supervise preparation of the soup , a task at which he spent most of that day , absenting himself from the noontime meal so that he could avoid responding to Bukowski 's implied proposal of marriage . He spent that time slaughtering a young pig and carefully catching all its blood in a ewer , which he brought back to the kitchen , where he added vinegar and salt to the blood and set the ewer aside . Asking the cooks for what meat stock they had , he added to it bits of cooked pork and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy soupbones and six large dried mushrooms that he and his daughter had gathered that autumn . Prunes ! ' he called , and cooks hurried up with a large handful . ' Cherries ! ' and they came with a cupful of dried delicacies , which he tossed into the brew . He tended the soup all afternoon , tasting it now and then and soliciting advice from his professionals : I want this to be the best . More salt , do you think ? ' When it was done to everyone 's approval , a distinguished golden Polish soup , he stirred in a large helping of crumbled honey cake to bind the various elements together . ' An excellent soup , ' he said before the evening meal , and when hep281heard the guests assembling in the dining hall he divided his soup into two portions , one extremely large , the other so small that it would serve only one person , and into this latter helping he stirred the dark blood and vinegar , keeping it over the fire until it turned an ebon black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen , and behind him came four servants bearing soup bowls for the guests , who sniffed approvingly as their rich portions of amber-colored soup were placed before them . Ignacy took the final bowl from the fourth servant and walked silently , ceremoniously to where Feliks Bukowski sat . Deftly , using both his big hands , he placed the bowl of black soup before the impetuous suitor , and when Feliks looked down at it and saw the terrible blackness he knew that his proposal of marriage had been rejected , and so did everyone else at the table . Convention required that he make no comment , betray no emotion . Like a soldier assigned to hateful duty , he ate his black soup , cruelly aware that the soup of the others was a rich golden brown , and after Feliks had finished his bitter dish , Ignacy Mniszech , big and bald and brazen , rose and announced to his guests : On this day my daughter Elzbieta is announcing her engagement to Roman Lubonski , son of my dear friend  --  Count Lubonski in Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Mniszech palace in Warsaw , and you are all to attend . ' Now convention required that Feliks , his black soup obediently consumed , felicitate the engaged couple , which he did with solemn grace , raising his glass and speaking in a voice from which emotion had been excised : May you enjoy unending happiness . ' But when he resumed his seat and looked dispassionately at the guests , a terrible confusion of images hovered about the long oaken table : the sleepy bear routed from his wintry cave became Poland , driven to extremity by the hunters converging upon her ; the first robber whose head had to be hacked off with many blows became the map over which the other executioners pored ; and lovely Elzbieta , the fairest girl he would ever know , climbed onto the narrow sleigh , holding Roman Lubonski by a silken string as if she were playing with him . Then the images dissolved and he realized that he had been used both at the Granickis ' and now at the Mniszechs ' as a foil : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaken the interest and the jealousy of the future count . He had prepared the way for Roman ; his kisses had alerted Elzbieta to the important task at hand , a union of Mniszech and Lubonski.  |p282Ignacy  was speaking : A century and a half ago Zofia Mniszech left Dukla to marry Cyprjan Lubonski , one of the happiest alliances in our family history . Inspired by Zofia , Count Cyprjan went on to defend Czestochowa against the Swedes and Vienna against the Turks . May this marriage with our Elzbieta encourage Count Roman , in his time , to similar braveries . ' The guests cheered and started to discuss their preparations for the wedding in Warsaw , and Feliks learned with dismay that the procession would not visit the grandest of the Lubomirski walled castles , the one at Wisnicz , on the way home . He remembered that this branch of the family had two marriageable daughters and was eager to see them on the chance that he , too , might take home a bride , but when he asked : Shall we not halt at Wisnicz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much work to complete in Warsaw , ' and Feliks thought : He found a bride for his son , so to hell with me . The Lubonski-Mniszech wedding had to be speeded , or Warsaw might disappear as the capital of a nation which no longer existed . The precise timing of Poland 's demise would depend upon the plans of the Romanoffsin Russia , the Hohenzollerns in Prussia and the Habsburgs in Vienna , but the design was so remorselessly set  --  like Lubonski 's and Mniszech 's design for the marriage of their children  --  that no reversal was possible . Poland 's future and Feliks Bukowski 's hopes were doomed . Count Lubonski was so pleased with the way Feliks had functioned in the courtship of his son Roman  --  exciting Roman 's interest in Elzbieta and more or less goading him into proposing to the Mniszech girl  --  that he insisted upon Feliks ' attending the wedding . Following a three-week layover at Castle Gorka , the grand expedition was assembled again , with an entourage of seventy , and started for the capital . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border unimpeded into old Poland , but this time there was a major difference : Feliks was taking with him his peasant Jan of the Beech Trees , a man slightly older than himself and one very wise in rural ways . This Jan had also been pondering many of the questions which had assaulted his master during the latter 's tour of luxurious palaces ; he , too , wondered why his village should have been organized for the benefit of only one man , Count Lubonski , who happened to be a gentle soul but one without any feeling whatever for his peasants , and very little , so far as Jan could discern , for his various gentry like Bukowski . Jan had never seen a really sumptuous establishment like Lancut , but he had worked often at Castlep283Gorka and could see the vast difference between how a count lived , with his fifty horses and forty servants , and how his peasants lived , with meat once a year , a new suit of clothes once every ten years , little medicine and less education . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word here or there concerning Poland and its future , Jan listened carefully , and graduallybecame aware that his master was concerned about many of the problems that troubled him , and after they had passed Pulawy , where the Czartoryskis had expressed vivid hopes for a new Poland in which even peasants would have rights , Jan felt bold enough to ask : When will these good things begin to happen ? ' and Feliks had to confess : Never . I think that soon there will be no Poland . ' And for many miles , as ice thinned in the beautiful valley of the Vistula , these two discussed the impending fate of what had once been their homeland , and Feliks laid forth his anxiety : I think Poland will be destroyed by her protectors . I think that in these days , when we 're building a fine new state marked by real freedom and not the Golden Freedom of a few , we will be engulfed by a new deluge and erased forever . The other nations hate us not because we 're backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do imperils them and they will have to strike us down . ' Jan , lacking Bukowski 's education and sophistication , could not appreciatemuch of his master 's thinking but he certainly comprehended the basic argument , which he expressed forcibly in his own terms : It is n't right , Pan Feliks , that I should work so hard and get so little . The Austrian king takes two weeks . The bishop takes two weeks . Count Lubonski takes six weeks . And you yourself take most of the rest . A man from Krakow came running through our village while you were gone , looking over his shoulder for the police , who followed after him three days later . He told us : " A general named Kosciuszko will bring an army to free the peasants . Be ready to join him when he comes . " I think , Pan Feliks , that if he comes , I will join him . ' Discussion along these dangerous lines halted as they approached Warsaw , and many local citizens who watched the colorful parade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the old styleseventy of them to attend one bridegroom  --  must have thought that theyp284were witnessing a funeral procession honoring the burial of past custom , for this kind of display was now rarely seen in the capital , which was apprehensive about its very existence . The expedition entered the city on a broad thoroughfare that had always been known under the curious name of Krakow Suburb , since it had formed in even the oldest times the initial stage of the highway leading to that southern city . As they traversed this boulevard they could see the imposing palaces of the Radziwills and the Czartoryskis , but as they approached the center of the beautiful city they came on that fine street Senatorska , where the Lubonski palace , a modest affair of marble and pyracantha bushes thirty feet high , stood beside the Lubomirski palace , a tremendous affair , and across from the stately Mniszech home , the most severe and imposing of them all . When Feliks saw the latter palace , where Elzbieta would be waiting for her wedding , he felt his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadway and throw himself at her feet , pleading with her to reconsider . Instead , even as he looked longingly at the Mniszech palace , he entered the portals of Count Lubonski 's Warsaw home . Although it appeared modest when seen from Senatorska Street , each of its three fine stories had thirty rooms , more or less , and this was customary in the homes of the leading magnates , for they liked to have in their Warsaw complement a dozen or so of the penurious gentry beholdento them , and these petty knights brought with them their wives and children , so that a palace might have as permanent guests some sixty or seventy persons , each of whom was obligated to serve the owner when he put in an appearance at the capital . In time of war , of course , the men would be called on to serve in the count 's private army , fighting on whichever side the magnate had elected to support . Feliks had settled into his modest room , he had no wife to justify an apartment , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next door arrived with a summons : The Princess Lubomirska invites you to join her in a visit of inspection to the Palais Princesse , ' and when Feliks asked what that might be , the messenger smiled broadly and said : ' You 'll see . ' Feliks was delighted to see Lubomirska again and was honored when she stepped forward almost eagerly to kiss him on the cheek . She was in her Warsaw costume now , fur decorating her dress , with jewels in her silvery hair and an imperious and condescending smile on her lips . I have such a delightful surprise for you , Feliks . Climb into my carriage . ' She directed her driver to go eastward on Senatorska toward thep285castle , where her arch-enemy King Stanislaw August still reigned , as she said , clinging on by his fingernails , ' but when the six horses were almost entering the castle compound , the driver pulled them smartly to the left , and Lubomirska with her young companion entered that most charming of the Polish streets , Miodowa , the Street of Sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor obviously important , like Krakow Suburb , it ran for only one very long block , but it contained some of the loveliest buildings in Warsaw , churches and bishops ' palaces and the residences of those new millionaires who mattered in the city now . As they rode , Lubomirska explained to Feliks who lived where and who commanded what authority , but as her carriage approached the end of Miodowa she gripped his arm and cried with the pleasure of a little girl : See what the Mniszechs have done for their child ! ' And on a plot of ground newly landscaped with the shrubs and flowers of spring , she showed him what was already called the Palais Princesse , a little marble building of exquisite taste , sitting back from the street , each window , each decoration balanced by another , as charming a small palace as all of Europe could provide . What a beautiful wedding present for a beautiful child ! ' she cried as she pointed out its various perfections . Quick , we must slip inside . ' The hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its French name , had muddied Miodowa so that Lubomirska 's coachman had to carry her to the entrance and then come back for Feliks lest he muddy his boots . Once at the doorway to the palais , Lubomirska assumedcommand , and with grand gestures , entered the little jewel and started describing its quiet glories : See how everything balances , a room here , a room there , the piano here where it will echo well , the harp over here where we 'll be able to see the player . ' She led him to each of the floors , expostulating on what a superb job those heavy peasants , those bearded Mniszechs ' had done , and in a small room on the third floor they found Elzbieta sewing on a piece of goldthreadedfabric . Darling child ! No one told me you were here ! ' Lubomirskaengulfed the bride-to-be in her arms , then pushed her toward Feliks with a gracious introduction : This is my young friend Feliks Bukowski , who pertains to Count Lubonski , your new father-in-law . ' Neither Elzbieta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took her hand gravely when she extended it and said : ' I wish you much happiness , Panna Elzbieta . ' ' As do I ! ' Lubomirska cried enthusiastically , kissing her robustly , and with that they withdrew , but when the visitors had descended to thep286second floor , where they inspected a barely furnished salon , Feliks fell into a chair , covered his face with his hands , and sobbed , Lubomirska , unable to guess what had assailed her young friend , drew a chair beside him and took his hands . What is it , Feliks ? ' And he burst forth with an account of his love for Elzbieta , and their sleigh ride , and their kisses on the battlements of the frontier castle . ' Pani Izabella , what shall I do ? She is my life . ' And she should be . I would to God that I were she , at her age , with her beauty . ' She gripped his hands tightly and said with a kind of grim determination : I was , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her striking beauty , but at seventeen , when I was supposed to marry Poniatowski , I was an important young woman with a strong mind and a good character . ' He could feel her hands tighening about his as she said : And I was scorned as few girls ever have been . Now I move from palace to palace , from country to country , and watch that silly man who scorned me slip down and down to an infamous conclusion . ' She dropped his hands and sat with hers folded severely in her lap . I could have saved him , Feliks . Jan Sobieski was a great king because he had a great wife , that Frenchwoman . Stanislaw Poniatowski could have been a great king if he 'd had character and support . But he doomed himself when he elected easier routes . ' She left her chair and displayed profound distress as she stamped about the room . He doomed himself , and I shall do everything within my power to speed that doom . He is strangling in his castle over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' She laughed . Help him ? She leads the three eagles who attack his liver . ' Why do you hate him so ? ' Feliks asked when the storm subsided . I do n't hate Elzbieta . I seem to love her even more . ' You 're not a Czartoryski , ' she said . I am , and I am cursed with tremendous pride . ' Are you working with the others . . . to destroy Poland , I mean ? ' What others ? ' At Niedzica , in Hungary . . . they gathered like vultures . Mniszechfor Russia , Lubonski for Austria , Baron von Eschl for Prussia . . Were they at Niedzica ? ' They were . For two weeks at least . ' And had they maps ? ' They did . ' And you guessed what they were up to ? ' I did . Count von Starhemberg came up from Vienna to speed things . '  |p287'And  what did you think , little spy , that they were doing ? ' ' They were preparing the final assault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were doing , little spy . You 're a clever lad , and now we must take the necessary steps to protect your future in this time of change . ' She drew her chair close to his and said : ' I love a lad who can weep for a lost lady . Feliks , we must find you a wife . ' Before he could respond , she said with that striking realism which marked all she did : ' We must find you a wife with money , Feliks . All you have to offer is a good appearance and a respectable name . To that you must add money if you are to survive in the new Poland . ' ' The Mniszechs laughed at me when I wanted to marry Elzbieta. lgnacy himself served me the black soup . ' She astonished him by saying bluntly : ' So also would I , had you come courting my daughter . No magnate of serious importance is going to accept you into his family . Poland has a thousand lads like you , young , good-looking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grand design you are nothing , and you had better realize that cruel fact . ' He gasped at the severity of her analysis , but when she hammered at him : ' Do you acknowledge that what I say is true ? ' he had to answer : ' Yes . But what shall I do ? ' ' Money is everything . And how shall you find money ? ' As she uttered this harsh summary of his situation she indicated with a sweep of her right hand the immense sums the Mniszechs must have spent to build this little palais , this flawless salon . ' Feliks , tell me , where are you going to find the money ? ' Again she intercepted his answer : ' Only by marriage to the daughter of some rich merchant . ' When he protested that he had no desire to humiliate himself by marrying a townsperson , she became impatient : ' Whom are you to choose , Pan Feliks ? You ca n't marry into a magnate 's family . And you must n't just drift along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as yourself . Your fathers always did that , and where did it get them ? ' This brutal question had only one answer ; Bukowski men had never made brilliant marriages , and as a consequence they lived in penury , obligated to do whatever the various Counts Lubonski directed , and it looked as if they must do so interminably unless Feliks could find himself a girl with money . In the gathering darkness the Princess Lubomirska instructed the young man she had once said she wished were her son : ' There is inp288Warsaw a wealthy merchant of tested character . I like him , always have . His name is Orzelski and he has a daughter of your age named Eulalia . He is rich enough to hope for her marriage with a young man of nobility . You 're poor enough to hope for marriage with an heiress . I think we should visit this Orzelski . ' And without allowing Feliks to object , she led him down the stairs of the Palais Princesse , which would now hold his beloved , and out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mud . ' We shall go to Orzelski 's . ' Gustaw Orzelski conducted a large establishment that imported goods from St. Petersburg , Paris , Vienna and London , sending in return the lumber and wheat of Poland , and since he had served as banker for many of those with whom he conducted his negotiations , he had been able to amass a respectable fortune . Princess Lubomirska , of course , had met him only at his place of business , a large and handsome store on a street parallel to Miodowa , and it was there that she went with Feliks . This is my dear and trusted young friend Feliks Bukowski , of good family , who has come to court your daughter . ' Orzelski , now in his fifties , bowed low to the princess and offered a respectful but limited nod to Feliks . Then , with the boldness which characterized Lubomirska in all her negotiations , she said : ' I think we three should drive directly to your home , Orzelski , because these things do not wait . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Send your carriage on ahead . Right now . To warn her . You ride with us . ' And it was she who dispatched the Orzelski footmen with instructionsthat Panna Eulalia was to present herself within the quarter-hour in her own drawing room . During the tense ride to the Orzelski home , a large house but not a palace , on Krakow Suburb , Lubomirska spoke forcefully : ' I think God must have ordained it that my Feliks should meet your Eulalia . These two young people need each other . . . desperately . . . a union made in heaven . ' ' But , Princess , I 've just met this young man , and he has n't even seen my daughter . ' ' True , but sometimes things are arranged in heaven , and this is one of them . ' She would allow no further discussion . ' What a splendid little palace the Mniszechs have put together for their daughter . Have you seen it , Orzelski ? ' He said that he had supplied the furniture from Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also the crystal hangings in the salon . ' ' I did n't notice them , ' Lubomirska said . ' For good reason . We do n't install them till tomorrow . '  |p289When  they reached the Orzelski home the two men were perspiring , one more nervous than the other , and as Eulalia moved forward to greet them Princess Lubomirska understood why , for as she was to write to a confidante : The unfortunate girl stepped clumsily at us , fat and red and positively oafish , and my heart wept for Feliks , but she was the only young woman available with the proper amount of money , so we had to accelerate things lest she fall into the hands of another . ' It was a painful meeting , Eulalia blushing like a wounded beet , Feliks barely able to hide his shocking disappointment , and Orzelski obviously dismayed to realize that he and Eulalia were not to find with Lubomirska'shelp a member of the magnate class , to which they had rather fatuously aspired . Tea was served in the English manner , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the piano than her Viennese professor would have approved . There was no mother , she having died some years previously , but there was a younger daughter as florid and awkward as her sister . It was a doleful meeting and Lubomirska knew it , so when the two girls were excused , with Eulalia almost bolting from the room , she became angry and sat the two men before her as if they were schoolchil-dren : You , Orzelski , are disappointed that you are unable to find a young man from a family of greater distinction . You , Feliks , behaved shamefully , showing your disappointment in not findinga rich girl of greater beauty . Who are you , pray tell me honestly , Pan Feliks , to demand anything ? What have you accomplishedeither in acts or wealth that entitles you ? I am disgusted with you , that you should humiliate a young girl in that brutal way . I am disgusted with you ! My dear friends , both of you . Families are like birds in the sky . Yours , Orzelski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . respect . . . hopes . Yours , Bukowski , is swooping downward . . . no money . . . no prospects . . . only honor . . . historic pride . Here she moved her now-heavy arms beautifully in the air , making crisscrossing patterns . You are caught in a moment when your two paths cross , one brief moment in infinity . Orzelski , Bukowski occupying the same fragment of the heavens . You will never cross paths again . You will never again share this mystical moment . Now I want you to listen . Orzelski , if you marry your daughterp290to this young man , you gain esteem and the possibility of his promotion to almost any position in the government , whatever it 's to be . Bukowski , if you marry this wealthy girl , your son can aspire to the daughter of a major family and his son might marry the daughter of a magnate . This is a golden opportunity for each of you . Feliks , I want you to go right now to whatever room Panna Eulalia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to ask her if she will walk with you tomorrow , and you are to smile , and kiss her hand , and tell her that you shall await tomorrow with joy . . . with joy , do you hear ? ' She pushed him from the room and sat talking with Orzelski about his last purchasing trip into Russia and about how he would conduct himself if Poland were ultimately destroyed ; he judged that whoever took over would require business affiliations , and he was prepared to provide them . Feliks did walk with Eulalia the next day , and before the week was out he and Eulalia met with Orzelski and Princess Lubomirska , who said : When a young man like Bukowski has no father , he having died with great heroism in a ridiculous cause , some older person must serve as parent , and I am proud to do so . I want the wedding to be held in my palace , for I have grown to love this young fellow and wish him well . ' It was arranged that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Thursday , and they were the highlights of the fading winter season , one brighter and more lavish than the other , and fortunately , Princess Lubomirska was never told of the curious behavior of her protege on the night of his wedding , but it was known among her servants : The wedding ended in our palace at three , and a procession of sixty horses led Bukowski and his bride to her home on Krakow Suburb , where one must suppose the marriage was consummated , but toward three in the morning he was seen leaving the Orzelski house and walking , without a hat , through the mud and snow to Miodowa , where he stood silent in the street , staring at the new Palais Princesse . He was there at dawn , just staring at the palais , when Pan Orzelski himself came and without saying a word led the young man back home . '  |p291That  very afternoon Jan of the Beech Trees came to the Orzelski home with secret information that an officer of the cavalry wished to see Feliks , immediately , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coffeehouse near the cathedral where a group of fiery young men were speaking in hushed voices , which often rose into daring cries : ' Kosciuszkohas appeared on the streets of Krakow , back from France and America , and he says that Poland can defend herself . ' ' Is he to be trusted ? ' ' None better . A true patriot . ' ' How old is he ? ' ' Nearly fifty , I suppose . ' ' Too old ! Too old ! He 'll start something , then quit at the first cannon fire . ' ' Not Kosciuszko . ' ' Has he a chance ? I mean a serious possibility ? ' ' We can win ! ' Feliks was impressed by the structure of this group : three sons of magnates , half a dozen lesser gentry like himself , four or five sons of merchants like Orzelski , and a handful of students from no discernible background . Seven were cavalry officers , the most eager of the lot , and all were of the opinion that patriots must move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only question Feliks voiced was one of the most profound : " Whom are we fighting against ? ' and one of the leaders said : ' Against them all . ' He learned , however , that the real battle , if one developed , would be against Russia , whose Empress Catherine was uttering bold threats . ' Can we defeat Russia ? ' one of the cavalrymen asked , and another answered : ' Prussia will move in to help us , you can be sure . ' Feliks , having overheardthe conversations at Niedzica , was not at all sure . But during the next week excitement in Warsaw grew , especially when one of Kosciuszko 's personal lieutenants slipped into the city to enlist volunteers in what he described as ' our great crusade . ' Feliks was inclined to join those who that day started to move south , but as a new husband with the responsibility of introducing his bride to her country home at Bukowo , he felt an obligation to return south with Count Lubonski rather than with the revolutionaries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count what he thought of men like Kosciuszko , the answer was : ' A man of good family , but a renegade . Picked up rotten ideas in America and especially France . Poland , no matter how it splits ,  |p292will  always be a country of peasants down there and magnates up here , and if you apply your new money wisely , Feliks , you can become a magnate one of these days . . . not soon , but quite possibly . ' ' What will happen to Kosciuszko ? ' ' Forget that name ! He 's a flash . He 'll march out of Krakow , and if the Russians do n't destroy him , the Prussians will . ' ' His people think the Prussians will rush to aid him . ' Lubonski broke into laughter . ' How ridiculous can you get , Feliks ? It 's Prussia that 's determined to annihilate us . ' He paused . ' And maybe with good cause . Maybe it will be better for us all when Poland quietly vanishes . ' ' Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Of course ! Feliks , do n't you see that with your new funds , Warsaw is your enemy ! It 's Warsaw that talks about liberties for the peasants . . . land for the townspeople . . . seats in the Seym for Jews , even . . . Once we allow that festering sore to be eradicated , Russia and Austria and Prussia will surely protect interests like yours and mine . ' When Feliks started to ask : ' But is there not a general sense of  --  ' Lubonski halted him : ' I 'll tell you what the general sense is  --  revolution . And it has got to be stamped out . Men like you and me will soon be fighting against Kosciuszko , not for him . ' On the second of April 1794 , word reached Bukowo that General Kosciuszko  --  he held that title in the armies of three nations : France , America , Poland  --  had marched from Krakow at the head of two battalionsand twelve heavy guns , and on the very next day Jan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eulalia was beginning to supervise things , with even more disturbing news : ' General Tormasov of Russia is marching with a big army toward Raclawice just across the Vistula . ' And on the fifth of April messengers sweating with excitement crossed the river : ' Kosciuszko has won a great victory . Routed the Russians completely . ' Now the contrast between Count Lubonski , defender of the old freedoms , and his liege Bukowski , aspirer toward the new , became irreconcilable , because the former summoned his private army to support the Russians , while the latter , attended by his peasant Buk , opted to join Kosciuszko , and though neither Lubonski nor Bukowski would have fired upon the other personally , each considered the other a traitor to Poland 's cause and hoped that the traitor 's side would perish . In a small boat Feliks and Jan poled themselves across the river on 6 May 1794 , the master armed with two guns , the serf with a mowingp293scythe and a length of metal-studded ash tree . When they landed on the far shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself is going to meet with us . ' Where ? ' Feliks asked . IHere at Polaniec , ' the men said , and they were correct . One of the crucial events in Polish history was destined to occur only a few miles from Bukowo at the ancient market village of Polaniec , and all that night patriots discussed the first great victory at Raclawice and those still to come as the Russian forces of General Tormasov and his Polish allies  --  among them , Count Lubonski  --  were driven out of both old Polandand the territories stolen in the two partitions . It was a night glowing with the sparks of triumph , but it did not compare with what was to happen on the following day . It was about a mile from the riverbank , near which the men hadcamped , to the tree-lined field where the general was to meet a large Vassembly of local citizens , hoping to enroll them in his crusade ; he was especially eager to entice men of substance like Bukowski from the Austrian territories , and all that morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing new conscripts to the cause . Symbolically , Feliks and Jan , master and serf , walked together up the gentle hill from the river and along the beautiful country road leading to Polaniec , joining a growing crowd , each man armed in his own peculiar way but most with scythes , which they were prepared to use against Russian guns . They came at last to the field , where several thousand irregular troops , themselves variously armed , marshaled the newcomers into orderly units well scattered over the area . At noon a wild shout of victory arose from the troops , for Kosciuszko himself was coming up the slight rise , and what caused the shouting was the fact that he was wearing , for the first time in this campaign , the heavy white felted peasant 's jacket popular in Krakow . He 's one of us , ' shouted the men with scythes , and the orderliness which the troops had tried to enforce broke down as men from everywhere rushed forward to greet their hero . Forty-eight and in the glory years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , not robust , he was spiritually commanding , a handsome , compactman with an almost angelic clean-shaven face framed in copious hair which came to his shoulders . He wore his usual uniform with the air of a patrician , which he was , and his peasant 's cloak with an easy informality that made him one of the people . Most of all , he was a leader , for when the rest of Poland lay sunk in chaos , betrayal and despair , hep294alone had stepped forward with a promise that the nation could be freed , and with his early victories against almost insuperable odds , had proved his claim to the spot prepared for him . Without dismounting , he launched into his oration : Men of Poland ! With few , we proved that we can triumph and bring real freedom to our imperiled land . With many , we shall drive the invaders from our fields , reunite our severed parts , and establish a new nation founded on justice . I speak especially to you men with scythes and clubs who fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When victory comes , you are to know a freedom you have never known before , and as of this moment your liberation begins . Peasants of Poland , you are free ! Peasants of Poland , you have all the rights other men have , and I shall name them . The land you have worked so faithfully can never be taken away from you by your landlord . The forests you have tended shall be your forests too , and everything that grows therein you , too , shall share , the wood and rabbits and the deer . The days of labor which you have given your magnates and gentry shall be diminishedby three-quarters . Where last year you worked eight months for them , you shall now work two . ' We form a new partnership in Poland , and we form it now , the master and the peasant side by side , rejoicing in new freedoms , new liberties for all . ' The proclamation was so sensational that it sent shivers up men 's spines and giddiness to their heads ; few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who stood to lose much under the new rules , cried with remarkable insight : Hooray ! France and America have come to Poland ! ' And the air was filled with waving scythes . From his horse , General Kosciuszko reached out and grabbed one of the scythes and demonstrated how it was to be used in battle : From the most ancient times farmers have used the scythe to mow their grain . Look , it forms a letter L , long handle , short cutting edge . If you carry it into battle that way , nothing can be achieved , because the Russians are n't going to stand there waiting for you to come close and cut them down . ' Men who had already been in battle laughed . No ! What you must do is this . ' And deftly he untied the little ropes which bound the blade to thep295haft , then retied them in a way to hold the long , sharp blade as a forward extension of the handle , transforming it into a pike eight or nine feet long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The weapon of freedom . ' Then , touching his peasant 's cloak , he added : The uniform of freedom ! ' and his rude army bellowed its approval . Bukowski and his serf Jan did not return home ; they were caught up in the frenzy and would remain so for the duration of this amazing effort . They marched with Kosciuszko toward a small town west of Sandomierz where a Russian detachment was garrisoned , and with the scythe-men rushing forward , impervious to gunfire and the roar of cannon , they overwhelmed the enemy . In this battle , which lasted only forty minutes , Feliks captured two fine Russian horses , and thinking to reestablish the old tradition , he took one to Jan of the Beech Trees , saying : Jan , hold this for me in case I need him in battle , ' and to his astonishment , Jan said : I fight on my own , and you on your own , ' and he would not tend his master 's horse as his ancestors had faithfully done for seven centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve as his squire , but now he had to pay money for this service . Some of the gentry were outraged by Kosciuszko 's revolutionary idea that peasants could be set free , and after they experienced the kind of rebellion which Feliks had seen with Jan , they muttered protests : This can never work in Poland . Peasants are born to serve , and the harder they work for us , the more content they are . ' They 're cattle , really , ' one landowner said . ' I did not say that , ' a protestor said . I asked Bishop Proszynski about that very topic , and he told me firmly : " The peasant has a soul . He is a real human being , but he was born to work and needs no alphabet or books . " Kosciuszko is terribly wrong in thinking he can give them freedom . ' Some of the disenchanted asked to speak with the general , who kept himself open to all , and after he had listened to their complaint that Polish peasants were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been forced to travel much . I 've seen many lands . And I 've learned one thing . All men are alike in the eyes of God . All are entitled to the same freedoms . ' But the Polish peasant . . Is exactly the same as the French peasant , who is exactly the same as the French nobleman . ' Could the French peasant appreciate a good wine ? '  |p296'I  have seen them do so . . . when they invaded the master 's cellars with guns and torches . ' ' Are n't you preaching revolution against the gentry ? ' ' I am trying to avoid revolution against the gentry . Come my way , dear friends , and you will save Poland . You 'll create a much better society , believe me . ' The more Feliks saw of Kosciuszko , the more he admired him . ' This man is all of one piece , ' he told the dissidents . ' He treats his horse with the same respect he treats me , and I 've seen him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his horse . And he can laugh at himself . ' One night at the campfire before a morning battle with a Russian army , Kosciuszko sat with his cavalrymen , smoke from the embers wreathing his handsome head . ' I knew a lot of trouble with General Washington , maybe the best man on earth these days . He made fun of my name , said no one could pronounce it or even remember it . Recommendedthat I change it to Kook . I grew angry and told him : " Look here , General , my name has the same number of letters as yours , and the same number of syllables , too . It 's Kosh-choosh ' - ko , and anyone with an educationought to be able to say that , " but he continued to pronounce it in four syllables Koss-eee-you ' - sko and sometimes even Ko-shun ' - ko , so I stopped trying to educate him . ' ' Was he a good general ? ' Feliks asked . ' He was a lucky one , and that 's even better . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I served with him the English could have killed us dead had they attacked at the moment . Always they hesitated , allowed us to regroup , or bring up reinforcements , and I call that luck . ' ' May the same luck attend us , ' an older man said , and Kosciuszko replied : ' It is for that we pray . ' During one waiting period , when it looked as if the rebels were going to drive the Russians clear out of all the Polands , old and new , Feliks and Jan slipped away , crossed the Vistula , and sneaked back into their homes , where Feliks saw with amazement the many good things that Eulalia had done in his absence , and he noticed that when his wife was dressed as a rural housewife rather than as a Warsaw belle , she could be quite handsome , the kind of woman Princess Lubomirska must have been when King Stanislaw August , the young Poniatowski , rejected her . It was rewarding to talk with her , for she loved to explain in detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the stables should havep297windows , and in the village I found this man with remarkable skills as a carpenter , so I paid him to  --  ' ' You paid him ? ' ' Yes . Your general 's proclamation at Polaniec reached here and the peasants believe they are free . ' ' But . . . ' ' I see no great problem , Feliks . We pay them a little . They work harder . We earn more . And everybody 's better off . ' She was still , as Lubomirska had so harshly described her : ' fat and red and positively oafish , ' but she was also pregnant , and this gave her an appealing dignity , and since her father had supervised her education , she had accumulated ideas from the books in three languages which she had brought with her to the manor house . Eulalia Bukowska was exciting to be with , for she had already adjusted to the new world that was coming and saw a score of ways by which she could use it to her husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she told Feliks as he prepared to rejoin Kosciuszko for the inevitable confrontation with the Russians at the gates of Warsaw , but before that crucial battle could be joined , a Russian general of supreme talent arrived in Poland to replace all those who had allowed Kosciuszko to outsmart them . He was Aleksandr Vasilievich Suvorov , a scrawny , ill-tempered sixty-five-year-old military genius who had spent half his life battling the enemies of Catherine the Great on distant fields and half-battling the Russian establishment , which despised him for his unorthodox behavior . He was a remorseless adversary , and when he appeared on the scene the Russian backbone stiffened . The showdown battle occurred at the village of Maciejowice , some distance south of Warsaw , and in the early stages Kosciuszko 's extremely brave peasants with their scythes created their customary havoc with the Russian lines , wave after wave of pike-wielding serfs simply smothering the czarina 's troops , but in the end the discipline of a professional army tipped the balance . In one cruel charge  --  three hundred Polish peasants armed only with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beech Trees was shot four times through the chest and head , his dream of freedom ending on a grassy mound . Kosciuszko , wounded , was captured and taken to a Russian prison , but he had encouraged some of the younger officers to escape northward to oppose Suvorov in his attack upon Warsaw . Feliks Bukowski was one of these , and in October , when the first snows were already falling , hep298slipped into the city , riding one horse and leading another . As he went down Krakow Suburb and turned into Senatorska , thinking to announce himself to Lubomirska , he saw Miodowa , the Street of Sweet Nectar , and turned abruptly into it , riding slowly toward the Palais Princesse , where his beloved lived in her little marble mansion . He reined in his mount , and for some minutes stood quietly , his two horses gladly resting from their long march , and after a while children gathered , asking him about the battles , and he told them that General Kosciuszko was lost and that the battle for freedom was imperiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he explained that they had been captured from the Russians . They wanted to know the horses ' names , and he told them ' Czar and Czarina , ' and one little boy yelled ' They 're both men horses , ' and he said ' I must have the names wrong . ' The noise in the street attracted attention from within the marble palais , and a stern footman appeared to caution silence : ' The young mistress is gravely ill and deserves quiet . ' ' Who ? Who ? ' Feliks cried . ' Pani Lubonska , the Mniszech mistress , ' the footman said . ' She deliveredher son and he does well , but she herself is endangered . ' Feliks leaped from his horse , throwing the reins to the boy who had noticed that both horses were male , and shouted : ' I must see her . ' ' That you can not do , ' the footman protested , and when Feliks brushed past him , dashing toward the door , the footman began to bellow , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' Master ! Master ! ' At the entrance to the palais , Roman Lubonski intercepted him : ' Feliks ! From where ? ' ' From the battlefield . Kosciuszko 's lost . ' ' I expected that , ' the young nobleman said ; he had not joined his father 's army opposing the revolution , but spiritually he had supported the Russians , and was pleased to know that the rebels had suffered a major defeat . ' I want to see Elzbieta , ' Feliks said , at which Roman began tq-0weep : ' You can not . Not even I am allowed . . ' Is she so ill ? ' ' Gravely . ' And Roman retreated into the palais , closing the door behind him and shutting Feliks , his companion of many years , off from any contact . For two days Feliks stood watch in Miodowa ; he slept spasmodically at Lubomirska 's palace , talking with her in brief interchanges and learningthat she reveled in the approach of Suvorov and the imminentp299termination of Poniatowski 's kingship . Once Feliks said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside , you trying to bring him down from the inside . ' She replied : He surrendered his crown the moment it was placed on his noble brow , for it did not fit . He had no concept of what it signified . And his cowardice before Catherine disqualified him . It has been thirty years of unceasing surrender and it 's time we terminated it . ' One morning she told Feliks : I 'm as bad as Poniatowski . I ought to have you arrested as a traitor  --  a Kosciuszko man . . . freeing the peasantsand all that rubbish . But I love you , Feliks . . . By the way , how 's the little Orzelska , though God knows she 's not so little . ' She 's bigger now , Pani . She 's pregnant . ' Thank God ! That 's what matters , Feliks . A family , a farm , a cradle , obedience up and down  --  that 's the soul of Poland and now you 're a part of it . ' Your nineteen castles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Poland needs leadership , Feliks . Only the magnates can give it . Andbesides , I rebuilt my castles and palaces , and no one else would . ' Your hundred and fifty thousand peasants  --  the ones you own . Kosciuszkotold me  --  ' Kosciuszko is a fool , and he will die in a Russian prison . The basic Poland will never change . ' She encouraged him to see the Mniszech girl , and on the third day he went boldly to the door of Palais Princesse and demanded entrance . There was a scuffle , during which he forced his way in . Dashing upstairs , he threw open door after door until he located the sickroom , barging in just before Roman Lubonski could stop him . Elzbieta ! ' he cried , rushing toward her , but when he saw her dreadful pallor he realized that she was near death , and he halted some feet from her bed , standing with his head bowed . She was even more beautiful than he had remembered  --  a young girl on a sleigh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the mountains , a young bride kneeling before the priests , and now a young mother approaching death . He did not speak , but his heart called her name , this splendid Mniszech woman who stood in the grand line of czarinas and murderesses and ghostly figures dressed in white on castle turrets . Oh , Elzbieta , it was worth a lifetime to have kissed you once . Tears like the river at Niedzica rushing through the gorge came from his eyes , and after a while , without ever having spoken to the dying girl or without her having been aware that he had been in her room , he allowedp300Roman Lubonski to lead him away . All that day he stood in Miodowa , and at dusk , when bells inside the Palais Princesse began to toll her passing , he bowed his head and even his body , as if the weight of centuries lay upon him . The end of Kosciuszko 's insurrection came with a force so terrible that all Europe shuddered . It was never known for sure who gave the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Suvorov received it ; it was suspected that Catherine delivered it in person , but some believed that Fyodor Kuprin wrote it out as part of his grand design for the Final Partition : You must teach these Polish pigs a lesson . ' No better agent for such a lesson than Suvorov could have been found , for on 1 November 1794 he threw his massive Russian army around the suburb of Praga on the right bank of the Vistula opposite Warsaw , where a last remnant of some 14,000 Polish patriots , including Feliks Bukowski , had assembled to try to protect the capital . Praga also contained about 10,000 civilians who were doing what they could to support the defenders of their little settlement . Against these Poles , Suvorov had brought up an army of nearly 40,000 professionals , and when the battle for Praga started he told them : No mercy . No prisoners . We must teach these pigs a lesson . ' The siege lasted only three days , the first , second and third of November , for on the fourth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of the 14,000 Polish troops , only 4,000 escaped to flee across the Vistula ; the rest were gunned down , mercilessly . Those who tried to surrender were shot as they raised their hands in the air . Thousands more were bayoneted when they sought to submit . Those who tried to resist were clubbed to death with rifle butts . Groups of twenty and thirty Russians would chase down an alley after one Polish soldier and stomp him to death when they caught him . And the only ones who survived within the city were those few like Feliks who hid themselves in cellars until the fury passed . But it was the ruthless slaughter of the civilian population which stunned Europe , because Suvorov 's men rampaged through Praga , shooting everyone who moved and stabbing those who did n't . Knifings , beheadings , shootings , castrations , rape and then piercing became the rule . It is said of such horrible affairs that the gutters ran with blood , ' but that is ridiculous ; however , in Praga blood did drip into the gutters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p301On  the evening of the last day , a roving patrol of Russian soldiers heard a noise in a cellar , and when they inspected they uncovered Feliks Bukowski , two Polish peasants with scythes , and a woman whose infant child had made the noise . With the savage sweep of a rifle butt they silenced the child forever , and with two bayonets they slew the mother . The sight of the peasants with scythes infuriated them so that they stabbed each of the two men a score of times , and then , recognizing Feliks as a member of the gentry who may have encouraged insurrection against Catherine 's power , they kicked him to death , their heavy boots breaking most of his bones . The dream of real freedom was ended . The sham of Golden Freedom was restored . In early 1795 , Baron von Eschl and Fyodor Kuprin met for the last time in the Granicki palace in conquered Warsaw , and now they were assisted by Count von Starhemberg from Vienna . With cold efficiency the three victors restudied the map already agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made in the boundary lines that separated the territories of the three partitioning countries . Poland vanished , the new lands of Russia , Prussia and Austria meeting at a point not far from Brzesc Litewski , which the rest of the world would know as Brest-Litovsk . Each of the conquerors acquired lands he had long lusted after : Austria gaining Lublin and Pulawy ; Russia picking up the Ukrainian estates owned by magnates like Lubonski and Granicki . There was no justification for this terrible rape of a free land . Such nations as Switzerland had long been encouraged to exist as buffers between larger powers , and there was no reason why Poland should have been denied this privilege , except that she had committed two fatal errors : she had evolved no way to defend herself with a stable government , regular taxation and a dependable army ; and in her weakness she had endeavored to initiate freedoms which threatened the autocracies which surrounded her . Had her neighbors been England , France and America instead of Russia , Prussia and Austria , she would surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was proposing were merely extensions of what that first trio had already accepted . To be both weak and daring is for a nation an impossibility . But it was what Baron von Eschl proposed during the final meeting that would shock the world when it was revealed ; for many years hisp302memorandum was unknown in foreign capitals , for it was not allowed to circulate , and there would always be some who would deny that it was ever promulgated , but it had been : It is the wish of my King , who is supported by the Empress of Russia , that from this day henceforth the word Poland never be used in any official document or spoken in any government circle . In our several portions every effort must be made to stamp out the language , the history and the observations . If a nation does not exist , the name does not exist , and we must never allow either to revive again . We have been patient . We have been compassionate . And we have been just . But as of this day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution has been reached . With remarkable speed , peace and adjustment came to Bukowo . Jan of the Beech Trees was dead , but his widow would mind the fields until her son could assume charge . Their welfare deteriorated savagely , for with the defeat of General Kosciuszko and the imposition of foreign rule , rich landowners were encouraged to convert the hours their serfs owed them into cash taxes , which meant that Jan 's son now owed Lubonski not forty weeks of hard labor but a hundred and ten zlotys , which he could accumulate only by many hours of additional labor at wages established by the count . Life for the peasants of Bukowo became increasingly brutal , reverting to the days of 1250 , but at the same time the Lubonskis grew richer , and soon they rivaled the wealthiest families of Spain or England . Eulalia Bukowska was left a widow with a child about to be born , but she had grown to like the old manor house of Bukowo , appreciating what could be done with it if her dowry was wisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they came to naught , because her father spirited her back to the new Warsaw , now in German hands , where his business was flourishing . In the city he found her a new husband , a member of the gentry slightly more elevated than Feliks had been , and as Lubomirska had predicted , his grandson would be eligible for membership in that gentry . So the Bukowskis lost all the Orzelski millions and the manor house reverted to its unkempt meanness . Ownership passed to Feliks '  |p303younger  brother , who suffered for some years because it was remembered that Feliks had participated in the insurrection . For Tadeusz Kosciuszko , immured in a Russian jail , the disappearance of Poland brought dramatic consequences : Catherine the Great , near death and seeing no possibility of further danger from the Polish hero , stayed the execution which he had expected , and at her death he was reprieved completely . Seeking voluntary exile in France , he refused an exalted appointment from Napoleon , whom at an early point he had interpreted correctly as a tyrant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avidly sought after by the Russian czars as their representativeand intermediary in government for their Polish holdings . But he , like the two Bukowskis , loved freedom as a tangible entity ; it was good to be free , and it was good to bring freedom to others . So he chose exile in Switzerland , and one of the last acts this great man performed was to set free a group of slaves he had been awarded in America . General Suvorov , on the other hand , was rewarded for his famed Pacification of Praga by being given two thousand serfs as his personal property , some of them coming from the estate Count Lubonski held at Polz in the Ukraine , and he showed no signs at all of freeing any of them . The Lubonskis fared well under the new regimes , receiving additional estates and privileges as a reward for the army they had contributed to the alliance . They prospered politically , too , for when the Habsburgs realized that they had all of Galicia , and a good deal more , securely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rule the area , and Count Laskarz Lubonski was remembered for his long and faithful services . Appointed governor of the area he had been so instrumental in bringing into the Austrian fold , he took immediate steps to ensure that his son Roman would one day be appointed to the Vienna cabinet itself . But before this became practical , it was essential that Roman find a second wife , and especially one who had the potential for forwarding his career . There was an ugly little byplay with the Mniszechs , who insisted that title to the Palais Princesse , which , after all , they had built for their daughter , revert to their family , but Count Lubonski argued in the courts , with a battery of lawyers from Berlin , that under Polish law title had passed to the husband at the moment of marriage , and a bench of three judges , who took bribes from both families , decided finally in favor of the Lubonskis , who had paid the most . Palais Princesse , retaining its lovely name , was now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Count Lubonski of Vienna . Selection of his next bride took a curious turn , for one summer 's dayp304his mother , the present Countess Lubonska , appeared alone at Lubomirska'spalace with a startling proposal : Princess , I 've been thinking about many things  --  Europe , Russia , especially the Habsburgs in Vienna . And if my son is to pick his way intelligently through the traps I can see looming ahead , he 's got to have a clever wife . My husband has never trusted your family  --  " Those damned Czartoryskis ! " he calls you , alwaysstirring things up . But as I grow older I see that the perfect wife for my son would be some able Czartoryski girl  --  someone exactly like yourself , as you were fifty years ago . Are there any ? ' Lubomirska was flattered ; it had always been her task to keep track of the marriageable children in her extended family , so it was easy for her to rattle off four names of girls who were showing real promise : You need someone who knows languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . German for power and English for common sense . Of course , she 'd have to have Polish for singing . ' How many do you speak ? ' Those five plus Italian . But she should also have had experience in the good schools of Switzerland , Italy and either France or England . Forget those of Germany , they train only policemen . Above all , as you Radziwills know , she must be clever . ' And attractive . ' If she 's all the rest , she 'll be attractive . My nephew Karolek at Pulawy has exactly the girl you seek , and may you be lucky enough to find her before someone else does . ' That evening she dispatched a rider to Pulawy with a simple message : In the case of Moniczka , do absolutely nothing until the Count and Countess Lubonski arrive . ' And next day the Lubonskistraveled south to Castle Gorka to pick up their grieving son Roman for a casual visit to the great Czartoryski families at Pulawy , where a marriage was arranged . The final days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Warsaw his brother Michal Poniatowski , Poland 's leading Catholic clergyman and her primate , had been so eager to escape capture by revolutionaries that he wrote a secret letter to the King of Prussia , advising him how best to capture the city . Unfortunately , his message fell into the hands of Kosciuszko 's men , who were so outraged by it that they threatened to hang him . The distraught king , thinking only of his throne , presented his brother with a terrible edict : Hang yourself , for if you wait for them to do it , the scandal will destroy the throne . ' Michal hadp305obeyed , but his suicide accomplished nothing , for soon thereafter both the throne and the nation collapsed . Stanislaw August , no longer a ruling king , became an embarrassment to the victorious powers , who solved his case rather neatly : he was taken to Russia as a kind of state prisoner , and although he repeatedly petitionedhis former bedfellow , Catherine the Great , for mercy , she refused to grant it or even to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she allowed him to rot in his comfortable prison , and there , in 1798 , he died , an exile , a rejected lover , the unwitting architect of his nation 's suicide.  |p306TWO  DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS in the year 1895 the spacious steamboat that plied the Danube between Vienna and Budapest arrived at the former city in early afternoon , bringing with it a tall , slim man in his mid-forties . Since he was a nobleman and a member of the emperor 's cabinet , he was given special treatment ; when the steamer docked in the canal , which had been dug to bring an arm of the Danube right into the heart of the city , all lesser passengers had to wait until this austere gentleman debarked into the cold , wintry town , his massive fur coat drawn tightly about him as protection from the snow which drifted down . He was Count Andrzej Lubonski , Minister of Minorities , whose missionto conciliate the Hungarian agitators had succeeded so conspicuouslythat he could expect commendation when he reported to the emperor . Hungarians were not easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he had to respect their furious patriotism and would tonight give public evidence of that respect . Waiting for him on the quay were two liveried servants , one driving a curtained carriage drawn by two handsome gray Lippizaners , the other a footman who handled luggage and then rode perched beside the driver.  |p307Policemen  monitoring the arrival area recognized the count 's carriage and gave it deference ; other would-be politicians from the lesser provincesof the empire , places like Croatia and Tyrol , sometimes tried to make a splash when they came to Vienna , acquiring for themselves a team of four or six dazzling white Lippizaners , but such men were quickly perceived as being nouveau , a French word much used in the capital , and were ridiculed . Count Lubonski , with one of the richest holdings in the Austrian section of Poland , could have afforded sixteen Lippizaners had he so desired , but he felt that such display was best left to the royal family ; he would be content to have his sober-gray carriage drawn by sober-gray Lippizaners , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he moved quickly from the gangplank to his carriage , where he said simply : Ringstrasse . ' The footman busied himself with adjusting the bearskin robe that would protect Lubonski from the cold , then scrambled to his perch , and the carriage was on its way . It proceeded along the quayside for some distance , then left the DanubeCanal , turning into that glorious chain of boulevards which encircled the ancient heart of the city . Thirty-eight years before , in 1857 , the Emperor Franz Josef had decreed that the walls of Vienna , which had protected it so valiantly in centuries past , should be torn down , with the empty glacis which then separated the fortifications from the encroachingsuburbs to be converted into a number of wide , tree-lined avenues , on each side of which were the great buildings of government . It had requirednearly a quarter of a century to complete this grandiose plan , and some historians had objected to the demolition of walls which reached back almost a thousand years . Let us retain in Europe one noble city which illustrates how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new Vienna proliferateon the other side of the glacis , and keep our walls as the symbol of our city 's history . ' The emperor would not listen , and although Vienna lost an awesome medieval monument , it gained as noble a series of boulevards as the world provided . Paris has better , ' some travelers claimed , but the French ones , named after Napoleon 's marshals , were not so intimately connected with the heart of their city , nor did they have that sequence of majestic buildings . On its Ring stood the great museums , the votive churches , the university , the theater , the Rathaus , the buildings of parliament and the stately opera . When Count Lubonski drove past these solid monuments he feltp308that he was at the center of the world , and he always rededicated himself to his assigned task of keeping the multiple minorities which comprised the Austrian Empire placated within the intricate system . Lubonski dealt constantly with members of some forty different nationalminorities : the able Hungarians , who were almost the majority ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline ; the Rumanians , thirsting for their freedom ; the Transylvanians , caught in a vise between more powerful groups ; the Bohemians , keeping Prague in uproar ; the Slovaks , insisting upon their own entity ; the Wends ; the Ruthenians ; the Slovenes ; the Montenegrin fragment ; the Bosnians ; the Germans of Silesia , who felt themselves oppressed ; the agitators from Bukovina , from Temesvar , from Teschen , from Carniola and the Trentino . And always , in the back of his mind , the special problems of the Poles , who occupied Galicia ; they were in some respects the strongest , ablest members of this amorphous empire , and he had been chosen for this difficult assignment of keeping all in balance primarily because he was a Pole . The emperor had advised his councillors : ' Lubonski is a Pole , and they 're damned difficult , but he 's also a gentleman . Vast estates . I 'm told he keeps ten thousand Ukrainians on his fields . He 'll understand minorityproblems . ' Several of his German advisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what was still essentially a German government , Austrian style : We 've made concessions to the Hungarians , and we 're no stronger for it . We 've granted the Czechs and Slovaks what they wanted , and if we promote this Lubonski . . As with the tearing down of the ancient walls , the emperor had his way , and the Pole Lubonski was brought into the government . It was a sagacious move , for every complaining faction of the empire now felt that with a Pole in charge of their affairs , they would get at least a decent hearing : For is he not himself a member of a client state , like us ? ' With a gloved hand , the count slid back a glass partition separating him from the coachman . ' Karl Peter , if Bukowski is at his coffeehouse , I should like to speak with him . ' Yes , Excellency . ' The carriage continued along the Ring past the university , then pulled into the garden of a fine old building housing one of the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chandeliered refuge where hot chocolate , European newspapers and gossip were provided . Karl Peter , going to the entrance hat in hand , inquired of the doorman : ' Is Herr Bukowski , the young Pole , is he in attendance ? '  |p309'He  is , ' the doorman said , pointing to a blue-and-cream fiacre whose public driver dozed while his fare disported himself inside . That 's the one he always hires . ' Please to advise him that Count Lubonski would like to speak with him . In the count 's carriage . ' At the mention of this respected name the doorman drew himself up to a haughty position , nodded toward the carriage , whose curtains were still drawn , and hurried inside the coffeehouse . In a moment he appeared with a young man of slight build , trim mustache and well-pressed , modishsuit . In his hurry to report to the count , the young fellow had merely thrown about his shoulders an overcoat made of English wool , and with bare head he half-ran toward the carriage , whose door opened invitingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voice said , and with one continuous , graceful movement the young man entered the carriage and took a seat opposite the count . How was Budapest ? ' he asked . ' As always . Music good . Food very good . Countesses the most beautifulin Europe . Politics . . . ' He shrugged his slim shoulders . As always , the worst in Europe . ' Can I be of service , Excellency ? ' Wiktor Bukowski did not work in Count Lubonski 's ministry ; he held a minor position in the Ministry of Agriculture , where he was appreciated as an expert on horses , but as a young Pole new to the capital , he naturally fell under the supervision of the count , who utilized him now and then on farming matters and instructed him in the ways of the imperial city . The emperor had a message awaiting me when the Budapest boat docked . Seems there 's a gentleman from the Banat with an urgent prob-lem . ' I 've met him , Excellency . Man named Pilic . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been his experience that self-important agitators from the provinces always stopped at Sacher 's Hotel near the opera and took their sweets at Demel 's near the Hofburg , and more frequently than he cared to remember , these enthusiastic patriots had tried to lure him to one of those establishments for discussions of pressing problems . It had become a matter of pride with him never to have entered either the hotel or the pastry shop : They are for visitors , not for those who do the work of empire . ' He could visualize this Herr Pilic from the Banat . You do n't have top310describe him , Wiktor . Small , thin man . Heavy suit made from Rumanian wool . Leans forward when he speaks . Has moist hands when he greets you . Thinks he 's in heaven because he 's in Vienna . But desperately wants to take Banat out of the empire . ' He shook his head dolefully . I really do not care to see him . ' I 'm afraid you must , Excellency . He 's come a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him in Vienna had come a long distance , because that was the nature of the Austrian Empire . It was a very long , dusty train ride to Croatia , much longer to the remote corners of Transylvania , and in some ways the longest of all from Vienna to Prague , which was not distant in miles but infinitely separated in ideas . The Banat of Temesvar was a small territory wedged into a corner by Rumania , Hungary , Transylvania , Serbia and Croatia , abused by all , defended by none . Herr Pilic , judging by his name , was probably of Rumanian descent and had come , no doubt , to complain against his Hungarian oppressors . His mission must be serious , for the emperor himself had directed Lubonski to listen to his protests . Fetch him to my house , ' Lubonski said . Half after six , sharp . ' ' Yes , Excellency . You would not care to stop by his hotel right now ? ' Lubonski did not change his expression . I do not stop by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicating that Bukowski was dismissed , but before the younger man could leave , the count reached for his arm and said warmly : The countess and I will be expecting you tonight , after the concert . ' ' I shall be honored . I shall be deeply honored , Excellency . ' And while Bukowski returned to the warmth of Landtmann 's and his London newspaper , Lubonski directed his coachmen to take him home . Now he pulled aside the curtain on the right-hand side of his carriage , for he was approaching that string of noble buildings which made the Ring so distinctive , and he wanted to see them . As he passed them he experienced once more that inner warmth which suffused him when he reflected that he played a major role in the governance of this city and the empire which it represented . As a Pole he missed the Vistula , and his castle , and his vast estates in Galicia , and the winter visits to Warsaw , but in Vienna there were compensations , and now he approached one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who appreciated good horses , had drawn him past the splendid museums , they reached the opera , that crystal-pure little heart of the city , loved by all who loved Vienna , and there they turned north into Karntnerstrasse , and for thep311first time in his journey from the boat Lubonski saw ahead of him the noble spire of St. Stephen 's Cathedral , seven hundred years old and the beaconlike center of the city . A light snow had begun to fall , throwing a blanket of silver over the ancient church , and Lubonski directed Karl Peter to halt the carriage so that he might savor this lovely sight . Then , with a knock on the partition , he indicated that the coachmen should proceed . They drove only four short blocks , then turned right into a small , distinguished , almost private thoroughfare labeled on the corner Annagasse . Had it been a wide street , it would have been called Annastrasse ; its present name signified an alley or a very narrow street , and this it was . It contained , close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vienna , three- and four-story affairs , severe in facade , soberly austere in The courtyard , interiors often magnificent in their muted splendor . With quiet satisfaction Lubonski checked off the houses in his alley , visualizing the notable families that lived therein , and finally , at the end of the row , on the right-hand side , he came to a modest house , its front occupying every available inch of sidewalk , its stone plaque proclaiming in the style used two centuries before , when street names were not jumbled together : ANNA GASSE22 1648It had been an old house when King Jan Sobieski marched down from Krakow to save the city from the Turks , and under its cellar there was still a deep cavern dug by the Turkish sappers who had planned to blow up the city with their huge deposits of gunpowder . Now came the moment that Lubonski relished whenever he returned From a trip to Hungary or Bohemia or Croatia . Karl Peter rang a bell attached to the carriage . Servants inside the house ran to the two huge gates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carriage inside , where a very large square , not visible from the street , was paved with blocks of oak rather than stone , the purpose being to muffle the sounds of hoofbeats . Many Viennese houses and minor palaces had such courtyards , with twenty or thirty rooms wrapping around the area , but what distinguished Lubonski 's 22 Annagasse was the wall that faced the visitor when he entered , for during the past hundred years servants had carefully pruned a huge pyracantha bush into a magnificent espalier which **25;11781;TOOLONG left and right as if drawn by some master designer . One set of branches outlined the windows of the first floor , another emphasized the second floor , and a third , high against the wall , crept under the windows of the fourth floor . Even in late spring , when the plant seemed rather drab , it provided a grand design , but in autumn and winter , when it produced a multitude of bright orange berries , it was a thing of splendor . Now , at Christmas , with light snow festooning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the count stood in the courtyard for some minutes , appraising it and thinking of how fortunate he was that his great-grandfather had bought this perfect place years ago when the Lubonski part of Poland first fell under Austrian control . His family had owned this house for more than a century ; his servants had brought this pyracantha to its present state of perfection ; and he sometimes thought that it was this sturdy plant whose roots tied him so strongly to Vienna . Leaving the courtyard , he hurried inside , ran upstairs , greeted his wife , Katarzyna , and called for a bath . I 'm to meet some dismal fellow from Temesvar . Yes , here . Then we go to the concert . And I hope you 've invited the musicians for dinner afterward . ' His wife , a daughter of the great Zamoyski family whose estates since 1815 had been in Russia , enjoyed sitting on a stool in the bathroom while her husband bathed , for then she knew that she could command his unbroken attention , and now she smiled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Famously . If I were n't a Pole , I 'd enjoy being a Hungarian . Robbers both . ' Who 's the man from Temesvar ? ' A Herr Pilic . Rumanian , I judge . ' But why here ? ' He 's stopping at Sacher 's , and I refuse to conduct business in hotels . ' He paused . You remember , I 'm to wear my Hungarian uniform tonight . To show that in Vienna , I pay them the same respect I do in Budapest . ' Lubonski , like all members of the imperial cabinet , owned twenty-odd different resplendent uniforms . Some pertained to historic Austrian regiments , but more than half were **36;11808;TOOLONG uniforms of foreign governments : Russian , German , French , English and one dazzling affair from Italy . It was interna &6nal; courtesy for an Ausofficialto appear in the uniform of any visiting king or prince , and Lubonski always honored this convention , except that he was ill at easep313in the Italian uniform , since the northern section of Italy had so recently broken away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibilities , were the ght or nine gaudy uniforms of the various components of the empire ; if he entertained Polish officials , he customarily donned Polish dress ; Bohemians were honored by seeing him in their national costume ; and Slovaks were similarly respected . Patrician in all aspects , he graced any uniform he wore , but the one which gave him solid pleasure was the Hungarian . As he left his tub his wife withdrew , leaving the dressing of her husband to his servant , and this man toweled his master , powdered his feet , attended his hair , and led him to where a gorgeous assembly of clothing , medals , daggers and swords awaited . When his underpants were adjusted , the valet doing the work , he slipped into the skintight suede trousers , then the knee-length woolen socks that would fold down over the calf-length elk-leather boots from Bohemia . He chose a lightweight silk blouse , subtly embroidered in paleredand blue designs , with a silver clasp at the high ribbed collar . His jacket was of Hungarian peasant pattern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blouse . He wore a cap made in Budapest , a tricorn affair topped by egret feathers , and about his shouldershe draped a leopard skin , beautifully finished and fastened with three silver frogs . Resplendent as he was , he was not yet fully costumed , for a wide sash pulled everything together , whereupon his valet slipped into the stocking of his left leg a sheathed dagger ten inches long , while into the folds of the sash Lubonski himself fastened a long sword with a gold-and-silver handle . He presented a dashing figure when all parts were given last-minute adjustments by the valet , who said admiringly : ' The emperor himself will applaud you this night . ' He received a less enthusiastic welcome from Herr Pilic when he entered the drawing room at six-thirty : ' My God , Your Excellency ! I came all the way to Vienna to protest against the Hungarians , and hereyou are , a Hungarian nobleman . ' Lubonski enjoyed such sallies and explained : ' Yesterday in Budapest , I Rave the Hungarians nothing they wanted . Tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed to is shimmering uniform , then asked politely : ' And what can I give you , Herr Pilic ? ' ' The Hungarians , they treat us like peasants . '  |p314Sit  down , please . ' Lubonski ordered wine , but told the butler : No tokay , please . Herr Pilic does not enjoy things Hungarian . ' What I do n't like , ' Pilic said , is the way in which the Hungarians abuse your imperial government . Your Excellency , they take everything from you and give nothing to us . ' Lubonski chuckled . No one has ever said it better , Herr Pilic . The Hungarians badger us day and night for what they call their freedoms . Heavens , they run the empire . But always they want more . Yet they treat their own minorities like swine . Slovaks come to me crying complaints about them . Rumanians , Transylvanians , Croats , Slavonians . . . it 's always the same : " The damned Hungarians are persecuting us . " What can the emperor do ? Tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an independent unit within the empire . ' Lubonski called for an atlas , and when its large pages were unfolded he pointed to the Banat , a mere speck within the vast complexity of Austria'sresponsibility : Herr Pilic , look for yourself . What you ask is an impossibility . We ca n't fragment this great empire . ' When Pilic started to remonstrate , Lubonski stopped him . Pointing now to huge Galicia , many times the size of the Banat , he said : Look at my Poland . A huge territory . But we exist within the empire . ' You do n't have Hungarians on your necks . ' True , ' The count leaned back , keeping the atlas on his knees , and said in the most conciliatory way : Pilic , share with me your honest thoughts . I need your counsel . What do you think should be done ? ' May I speak frankly ? ' You 've come very far to waste your time , otherwise . ' Without waiting for the servant , Pilic poured himself a large drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A confederation . Each natural nation on its own . The Banat . Croatia . Bohemia . Carniola . Hungary off to itself . ' When he saw Lubonski frowning he added quickly : Poland too . Poland a nation of its own . ' Lubonski showed no change of expression , for he suspected that Herr Pilic might have been sent by his German enemies within the government to test his loyalty . Ringing for the servant to pour additional drinks , he said quietly : So far as I know , there is no outcry for a Polish state . Or for one in Carniola . Or Bohemia . ' There is great unrest in Bohemia , Excellency . You must know that . ' One out of ten thousand does not constitute great unrest , Herr Pilic . ' ' If he is the right one , he does . '  |p315'I  am not aware of any great demand for a separate state in the Banat . ' But you must be aware of our anger over the oppression we suffer from the Hungarians . They are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . They are hell to live under . ' Would the Rumanians be any better masters ? Or the Slovaks ? ' Why must we have any masters ? ' Lubonski pondered this difficult question , so common in the empire these days , and replied gently : Because that is the way God has ordained this part of Europe . ' And he placed his left hand on the map so that it covered most of the Austrian Empire . When you dress like a Hungarian , Excellency , you talk like one . ' Tonight I am Hungarian . ' ' So my visit is a waste of time ? ' ' No ! ' Lubonski cried , throwing the atlas aside and rising to his feet . ' Herr Pilic , you shall meet all my subordinates . Right after Christmas . And they shall listen to your complaints , and if justice is required , you will get it . ' With his leopard skin falling gracefully over his tunic , the count placed his arm about his visitor 's shoulders and walked him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this extraordinary meeting in his home because the emperor himself had requested it . ' The Banat of Temesvarmay be small , Herr Pilic , but it is never lost in our conscience . ' ' It 's an honor to talk with someone who knows where it is . ' ' And now I must help my wife prepare for the concert . ' ' May the music echo with the sounds of Christmas , ' Pilic said as he went down to the courtyard , where a surprise awaited him . ' I 've asked my coachman to return you to your hotel , ' Lubonski said , and he watched with real pleasure as the little man climbed into the exquisite carriage and settled back against the cushions as the two gray Lippizaners clip-clopped their way upon the oaken blocks that softened the sound of their going . The gala Christmas concert was held in a theater that seated more than a thousand , but for the first part of the evening the guests looked less at the stage than at the imperial box , where the Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with heavy white sideburns and mustache  --  was married to one of the most glamorous women in Europe , and one of the most neurotic . Empress Elizabeth , a German of the House of Wittelsbach , had lived with young Franz Josef long enough to bear himp316three daughters and a son , but had then sought refuge from the intense boredom of the court by traveling incessantly  --  Greece , Italy , France , England  --  by building a vast palace for herself on the island of Corfu , by attaching to herself a series of what she called ' my attendants '  --  a Greek professor , an English hunting gentleman , an impecunious teacher  --  and11 by writing impassioned letters to other men under one of her pseudonyms : Gabrielle , the Countess von Hohenembs , Mrs. Nicholson . No other supreme emperor in history had ever been so poorly served by his wife as Franz Josef . Empress Elizabeth 's behavior was a scandal and her lavish expenditure of public funds a threat to the monarchy , butdill/Franz Josef could do nothing to discipline her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forty-year alliance with one of the most ordinary mistresses an emperor had ever selected , and on this night she was visible to the Viennese public . Katharina Schratt , deserted wife of a minor Hungarian landowner , had made herself into a popular actress in comic roles . Not pretty , not gifted , not blessed with any unusual talent , she had developed a rowdy style of comedy which exactly suited her bubbly personality and her rather plump form . She was , in fact , an Austrian hausfrau converted into a most ordinary actress , and it was because of her commonplace appearance and behavior that the emperor had chosen her as his companion and confidante . This was reasonable , since Franz Josef , this all-powerful emperor of asprawling empire which embraced all of central Europe , was himself amost ordinary man . He read no books , appreciated none of the great plays then available in Vienna , understood no music except German military marches , and failed even to comprehend the vast political movementswhich agitated his empire . Unable to control his beautiful empress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she returned to Vienna from her interminable travels with other men , he found consolationwith Frau Schratt , but in what precise way , not even the intimates of the court could say . Is the little Schratt his mistress ? ' a Bohemian politician asked Count Lubonski during a painful set of negotiations . It was customary in Viennato use the phrase the little Uspanski ' or the little Kraus ' to refer to any reasonably presentable young woman who was unattached : it depersonalizedher , making her fair game for the men of the city . The little Schratt ? Who knows ? I certainly do n't , ' Lubonski said , and when on another occasion Wiktor Bukowski asked the same question ,  |p317Lubonski  reprimanded him : ' It is not proper for a man your age to inquire into such matters . ' On this evening Frau Schratt had come into the concert hall with the emperor , but she was not seated in his box , for that honor was reserved for the absent empress , but in a nearby box occupied by two noble families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actress refrained from looking at the emperor and he kept his eyes on the stage , but the pair caused great excitement among the Christmas gathering . The program was in that heroic mold made popular in Beethoven 's day , when an evening 's entertainment might consist of two or three symphonies , a concerto or maybe two , improvisations by the pianist and perhaps a half-dozen songs . The Viennese loved music , and on this night they would enjoy a substantial treat . A conductor well known in Berlin would lead the local orchestra in Beethoven 's Eighth Symphony , a jolly , holiday affair , after which a Berlin pianist would join the orchestra to present Mozart 's delectable Piano Concerto No. 21 in C major , K. 467 . After an intermission , a group of singers from Munich would offer Brahms ' glorious Liebeslieder Waltzes , with the Berlin pianist and one from Vienna as dual accompanists . Then the same singers with their pianists would venture a radical presentation : Gustav Mahler 's Songs of a Wayfarer , scored not for contraltoas originally composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second intermission , after which a young Polish pianist from Paris , Krystyna Szprot , would offer a selection of pieces by the Polish composer Frederic Chopin . As the program , embellished with angels and Christmasornaments , explained : Mlle. Szprot will announce her selections from the stage . ' When the Count and Countess Lubonski came down the aisle to their seats  --  as a conservative Pole working among Germans who distrusted him , he deemed it imprudent to take a box in which he would be conspicuous  --  his quick eye saw several things : the emperor had none of his family with him ; the little Schratt was properly off to one side ; young Wiktor Bukowski was in place , properly dressed , in the seat next to his ; and Herr Pilic from the Banat of Temesvar had purchased himself a seat with other visitors from protesting provinces . He also saw that the hall was resplendent in the Viennese style : glitteringuniforms like his own , which often made the Austrian officers more beautiful than their women ; at the last three European competitionsAustrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forp318overall grandeur , but the military men wearing them had won medals for nothing . In its last four wars the Austrian army had been humiliated . When the orchestra was seated , the Berlin conductor walked stiffly onstage , bowed to the emperor , then to the other boxes , and finally to the orchestra itself , and with a quick flash of his baton , sent the players into Beethoven 's rollicking little masterwork , composed not far from . where the musicians sat . The orchestra did not play the music , they danced through it , appreciating the fact that no other symphony in the repertoire would have fitted so perfectly the mood of this Christmas season . But just when Lubonski was most attentive to the masterful way in which Beethoven was bringing his little gallop to a pleasing conclusion , he felt Bukowski nudging him ; the young man was pointing to the imperial box , where the emperor had fallen asleep . Keep your eyes on the stage ! ' the count said in sharp rebuke , and by the time the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bukowski , a difficult young man to repress , said as six husky stage personnel pushed a large piano into position : If that thing ever started slipping . . It 's their job to see it does n't , ' Lubonski said . Do you know the Mozart they 're playing ? ' No . But I 've heard both the Brahms songs and the Mahler . I 'm waiting for them . ' You 'll soon hear some splendid music , Wiktor . Listen carefully . ' Bukowski was not much impressed with the first movement of the concerto and judged that the German pianist did not strike the piano keys hard enough ; in fact , his mind wandered and he began to scout the various boxes to see which of Vienna 's beautiful young ladies were inI , attendance , and at one point , when the piano and orchestra were marchingthrough some undistinguished routines , he again nudged Lubonski and whispered : ' That box next to the little Schratt ? Who has it tonight ? ' Lubonski was irritated by the interruption , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity , and he followed Bukowski'sdiscreet pointing . That 's the American ambassador . A boor , but extremely rich . From Chicago , I believe . ' And is that his daughter ? ' I suppose so , ' Lubonski said without looking . He loved this Mozart concerto and had picked it out on his piano to the extent that he could follow the music , but Bukowski , interested as he should have been in attractive young women , stared at the American box and tried to deduce what kind of person the ambassador 's daughter might be : She could bep319his niece . Or just a visitor . Not what you 'd call pretty . But striking . Yes , striking , and I 'll wager that gown came from Paris , not Chicago . He was engaged in such assessments when the first movement of the concerto ended with an agitated succession of sounds and a coda of some brilliance . Was n't that inspiring ? ' Lubonski asked , and the young man said : One of the best , Your Excellency . ' And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the orchestra began the second movement with a soft but very marked waltz beat 1-2-3 , 1-2-3 in the winds , horns and cellos , atop which came the violins in a theme so delicate and lambent that he turned his full attention to the stage , where that obsessive 1-2-3 continued , with the violins producing an even more enchanting melody . Then , when he was not noticing the piano , that instrument broke in gently with its own statement of ravishing melody . Oh ! ' he whispered , but Lubonski did not hear . He was captivated by the elegance exhibited onstage : waltz beat , violin melody , piano statement , all fused into one of the miracles of music , a perfect harmony of composition and performance . This second movement of Concerto No. 21 was one of the most ingratiating ever composed , and Vienna accepted it warmly on this festive night . But Bukowski noticed that the emperor was again asleep . However , when he sought to point this out to Lubonski , the box was empty . Franz Josef had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and after a decent interval Frau Schratt followed . They would return to the palace , where in the emperor 's private quarters she would make him a cup of hot chocolate and talk to him as he munched biscuits and warmed himself , after which he would be in bed by nine , for in the morning he must be up at four , reading carefully every report placed before him , making brief notes on the margins , altering nothing , commanding nothing , just working his way through another day at the head of his vast empire . During the intermission Count Lubonski wanted to talk about the scintillating Mozart and the magical manner in which the three parts of the second movement were held in balance , but Bukowski was eager to see if he could manage in some way or other an introduction to the American ambassador and his entourage . He failed , but when the concertresumed he found a gratification he could not explain from the fact that the ambassador 's daughter or niece was still in attendance . The Liebeslieder Waltzes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : to the lively accompaniment of two pianos a mixed quartet sang of the joys and despairs of love . Both Bukowski and his count knew these songs , so very popular in the city , and each had certainp320selections he preferred ; Lubonski regarded the lovely apostrophe to the Danube , Am Donaustrande , ' a perfect evocation of the city in which he spent most of his time these days , and he was especially fond of the song to the little bird , Eine kleiner hiibscher Vogel , ' for it reminded him of the pleasures he had known in the Vienna Woods in which the bird lived . Bukowski , for his part , liked the cry of the tenor and baritone as they sang of their love for women in general , ' 0 die Frauen , 0 die Frauen . ' This was a song which he himself might have sung , for he was fearfully confused about women ; he cherished them , dreamed of them , wondered which one he would marry and whether she would agree to live half the year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vistula . During the twelve months of 1894 he thought he had been desperately in love six times , with six totally different young women , two Austrians , two Poles , one Hungarian and the niece of an English lord to whom he had never spoken , and this year had been no better . Now he closed his eyes , allowing the rich sounds to flow over him with their heavy burden of longing , their promise of ultimate fulfillment , and the blending of the four voices , the extreme manliness of the baritone , the feminine apotheosis of the soprano , seemed to him the most powerful statement of sexuality he had ever heard . The vanished emperor was forgotten , the bright uniforms , the glitter of the boxes , the shimmering quality of the concert hall , all were gone and he was in some timeless setting . 0 die Frauenl ' he whispered . Hush ! ' Lubonski snapped , poking him sharply with an elbow . The count liked Bukowski , for the young Pole showed promise of becoming an excellent official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . A man of significance , especially a minority officiallike Lubonski , had to be careful whom he sponsored , because many young Poles had made asses of themselves in the capital . They 'd proved themselves provincial yokels , bringing scorn upon all Poles , and until a young fellow had been tested , there was no way of predicting how he would meet the challenge of a great city like Vienna . A man could be of some significance in Krakow , yet prove himself a fool when posed against sophisticated Germans and Frenchmen . Bukowski looked promising . He spoke German , French and some English , knew how to dress , flattered women easily and made small conversation with their husbands . But the real Bukowski had yet to show himself , and Lubonski would prudently mark time before pressing the imperial government to promote him.  |p321The  young fellow was unaware of the count 's speculations , for the two women singers were uniting in a song which tore at his heart : ' A bird will fly afarSeeking the proper glade . So a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He was convinced that this was true , and he wondered when the seeking woman would find him , so that her life could blossom . Where was she ? How did one locate the woman ? When applause for the singers ended , Lubonski told Bukowski and the countess : This next is rather daring , you know . Mahler , whom you met at the opera , wrote these wayfaring songs for solo voice . Now four are singing them , but you know . . . ' He paused to nod to Herr Pilic , who had moved so as to attract Lubonski 's attention . ' You know that Mahler later borrowed the songs to use as the base for his first symphony . ' And very good it was , ' Bukowski offered . If you like Jewish music . The songs wo n't be light and dancing like Brahms , I can tell you that . ' After only a brief pause the singers rearranged themselves and the two pianists began a slow and mournful theme , to which the voices soon added a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad swelling movementdeveloped , in which Bukowski could visualize himself striding over bleak , empty spaces . . . alone . In the rich sadness of late youth he indulged his passion for romanticism , spurred on by the changing , drivingimagery of the Mahler songs . Count Lubonski had been right ; this music had little to do with Brahms , or Beethoven either , yet it was passionately Viennese , the almost majestic inheritor of the great tradition . It 's very Jewish , ' Lubonski whispered to his wife , but I must say I like it . Throughout the cycle the two pianos and the four voices created an increasing sensation of persons lost in vast expanses , wandering forever toward some goal undefined and never to be realized . It was music for the year 1895 , on a snowy night , in central Europe . There is the key ! Bukowski thought . I 'm on the plains of Poland , Russian Poland that I saw once from the train . It 's my land , my Poland , and I 've never really seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footsteps became longer , for he was **31;11846;TOOLONG approving murmurs . " But you have no need to fear for me . The spirits of our ancestors are with me , and will protect me from any harm . It is they who have shown me the way I must act , and they will not accept me among them until I have completed my work here , among you . " Balam Xoc paused , and Nohoch came to his side , having finally worked his way through the encircling crowd . Then Balam Xoc gestured toward the Plaza of the Ancestors , which lay behind him , to the north and west , out of sight behind the intervening buildings . " I must go now and speak with Ah Kin Cuy . I ask you to walk with me that far , in silence and dignity . I trust that you will do nothing to violate the decorum of the sacred precinct . " " This is not wise , " Nohoch whispered urgently , but had to follow along when Balam Xoc ignored him . The crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in behind him and Nohoch as they proceeded out of the plaza , past the last of the Jaguar Paw buildings . Their path skirted the edge of the marketplace and one of the city 's ball courts , and the warriors and merchants crossing the adjacent plazas stopped to stare as the long , straggling line of blackened faces moved past in silence . Descending a broad flight of stairs , Balam Xoc led them past the ceremonial ball court that lay in the shadow of Cacao Moon 's funerary temple , entering the Plaza of the Ancestors at its southeastern corner . One of the warriors patrolling the precinct moved to intercept them , then thought better of it when he saw the extent of the crowd , and went instead to find a superior . Admonitions of silence were unnecessary here , and the people spontaneouslyformed themselves into tighter , more orderly ranks as Balam Xoc continuedalong the southern edge of the Great Plaza . To the north , across the vast expanse of the plaza , were the rows of ancestral monuments , some painted and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beyond and above the monuments , elevated upon an enormous , two-tiered platform , were the clan temples , standing upon high , pyramidal platforms of their own , their brilliantly painted roof combs rising skyward like headdresses . Flanking the plaza to the east and west  --  the directions of the Sun 's rising and descent  --  were Cacao Moon 's great burial temple and that of his mother , the Lady Twelve Macaw . Since the south was thought of as " below , " the long building facing onto the plaza from this direction had nine doorways , one for each of the levels of the Underworld . Stucco masks of the Bolon-ti-ku , the Nine Spirits of the Underworld , hung in a frieze over the doorways , from which the ruler and his priests would issue when reenacting the Sun 's emergence from his nightly journey through the Underworld . Balam Xoc stopped at the foot of the wide staircase that led up to this building and turned to face his followers . " Go back to your homes and work now , my people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence that you have given me the strength to return to you . Go in silence and respect , so that nothing might be said against you . " Raising his hand over them in blessing , he turned and went up the stairs , with Nohoch close behind . The platform above was lined with priests who had been eyeing the crowd with disapproval and alarm , but Balam Xoc paid no heed to their glances as he strode past them and entered the central doorway . The narrow , high-ceilinged chamber was crowded with priests , whose presencep101made the darkened room little cooler than the outside . The high priest sat cross-legged on the bench against the back wall , flanked by his assistants on one side and by Tzec Balam , the high priest of the Jaguar Paw Clan , on the other . Ah Kin Cuy was a man some five years older than Balam Xoc , with a long , imperious face and heavily hooded eyes that gave him a deceptively sleepy appearance . After accepting the greetings of Balam Xoc and Nohoch , he gestured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assembled priests closing in around them on all sides . " I have summoned you here , " the high priest said solemnly , " at the request of your kinsman , Tzec Balam . He has lodged an official complaint , protesting your deviation from the clan ceremonies . " Balam Xoc looked over at Tzec Balam without reproach in his eyes or face . " I thank you , my son , " he said quietly , " for providing me with this opportunity to express my views . " " You are here for much more than that , Balam Xoc , " Ah Kin Cuy interjectedharshly . " You are here to answer for the heresies you have been spread-ing . " Appearing neither moved nor offended by the accusation , Balam Xoc stared back at the priest for a long moment , allowing the silence in the chamber to deepen and swell , until no one seemed to be breathing . " I am here because you summoned me , " he said in an even voice , " and I obeyed out of courtesy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so formally . But do not try my patience with idle threats . " White showed all around the high priest 's eyes , but he kept his temper , holding up a hand to silence the angry murmurings of the other priests . " Defiance is not becoming in men of our age , Balam Xoc , " he suggested mildly . " It belongs to the rashness of youth . " Balam Xoc looked at him and sighed audibly , as if his patience were indeed being tried . " You know my age . Speak to me seriously , Ah Kin Cuy . For what do you desire an answer ? " The high priest leaned forward angrily and pointed a bony finger at the man seated below him . " You have criticized the Count of the Katuns , and cast doubt upon the validity of the katun prophecy . You have stirred the people of your clan into rebellion against their ruler , and you have preached contempt for the rites that protect us all . Answer for that ! " " I have stirred my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balam Xoc shot back without hesitation . " I have told them to seek their protection in the rites of their true ancestors . I do not consider the katun rites to be among these . " Ah Kin Cuy sat back abruptly , holding up both hands to quiet the other priests , who could not contain their outrage and disbelief . Nohoch Ich raised an unsteady hand to wipe away the sweat that was streaming down his face , but Balam Xoc sat like a stone , oblivious of the storm breaking around him . " You have a very long memory , " the high priest observed drily , once silence had been restored . " Do you not trace your ancestry back to Stormy Sky , the founder of Tikal 's greatness ? " " To him , and beyond. , ,  | " But you would grant that your clan prospered from its associations with him and his descendants , who later founded the Sky Clan ? " " That is true , " Balam Xoc agreed easily , allowing himself to be led by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the katun rites were first practiced in Tikal during the reign of Stormy Sky ? " " So the Sky Clan has always claimed , " Balam Xoc allowed , then suddenly went on , disrupting the line of questioning : " I have studied the ancient books of my clan , however , and I have found evidence that the practice was initiated by the father of Stormy Sky . By the man we know only as Curl Snout , because he was a foreigner , one of the Cauac Shield people from Kaminaljuyu . " Poised on the verge of his next question , Ah Kin Cuy seemed unprepared to be disputed on such a fundamental point , and he was momentarily speechless . The priests around Balam Xoc stirred uneasily , frowning at this denial of common knowledge , yet affected by the conviction with which it had been uttered . The books of the Jaguar Paw Clan were a reliable and highly respected source for all of the priesthood , and Balam Xoc himself had been known as a careful scholar before his recent surge of activism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of historical fact if he did not indeed have some evidence to stand behind ? " This evidence will have to be examined , " the high priest said finally , expressing his own respect for the sources Balam Xoc had at his disposal . " But in any case , you are resurrecting an ancient argument , one that was resolved long before our grandfathers were born . And in doing so , you only confirm the ancient existence of the katun rites . " " I confirm their foreignness , " Balam Xoc stated bluntly . " The mother of Stormy Sky was a Jaguar Paw woman , but it was not with her family that this practice began . " " You are speaking of events that occurred at the end of the last cycle , " Ah Kin Cuy pointed out in an exasperated tone , " nearly twenty katuns in the past . Can you not admit that in the time since , we have made these rites our own , and have all benefited from them ? Can you possibly contend that your clan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " And in its misfortunes , as well , " Balam Xoc averred . " The Prophecy of the Katun has become a burden my people can no longer bear . It is not theirs to bear . I have seen this in a vision given to me by my ancestors . " The men in the room seemed to suck in their breath simultaneously , hollowingthe silence that followed Balam Xoc 's revelation . Ah Kin Cuy 's face tightened perceptibly , and he turned to confer with Tzec Balam in a low voice . No one moved in the chamber while he pondered the priest 's reply , regarding Balam Xoc with renewed wariness . He seemed reluctant to allow this conversation to go on , given the unexpected turn it had taken , yet the hushed , awestruck mood exerted a pressure of its own , compelling him to respond . " You have reported no such vision , " he said lamely , frowning even as he spoke , as if regretting his words immediately . " It is not my obligation to do so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain of the vision 's meaning and authenticity . I received that certainty during my last confinement , when the spirit of my ancestor came to me for the second time . It was she who inspired me to dance without feathers ... "  | " That is enough ! " the high priest exclaimed , too loudly , waving his hand through the air , as if to wipe away Balam Xoc 's last statement . " I have heard enough , " he added with more control . " Go now . I will summon you again when I have reached my decision . " " As you wish , " Balam Xoc replied politely , and rose with Nohoch Ich to bow before the high priest . As the two men turned to leave the chamber , the priests behind them backed out of the way , and several of those near the doorway bowed respectfully to Balam Xoc as he passed . Then he stepped out into the sunlight and started down the stairs , his footsteps echoing softly in the great , enduring silence that hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was set into a pocket in the hills on the eastern of the river , which was swift and deep at this point , cutting a nail gorge between the high ground on both sides . The docks were at southern end of the city , which rose in successive levels in an easterly and t northwesterly direction , its curving shape determined by the steep , bro terrain . It reached its greatest elevation at its northern end , where a comr of temples and palaces topped a hill overlooking the river , some three hund feet below . The Tikal delegation arrived at the docks in the late afternoon , in the m : of a blowing rain that obscured their view of the city above and made disc barking difficult and slippery . They were assisted out of the canoes by serve holding palm-leaf umbrellas , and then were taken immediately to a lc thatched-roof building with many doorways , where the ruler and dignita of Ektun were waiting to greet them . After the guests had divested themsel of their rainwear in the outer gallery , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spacious and had as many doorways to the outs Streamers of red and yellow flowers decorated the walls and hung from rafters , and cloth-covered mats had been laid out on the floor to pros seating . As he took a seat in the middle ranks of the delegation , next to Chan 1V Akbal gazed around him observantly , listening to the tone of the greeti being exchanged . He had missed the welcoming ceremonies in Yaxchilan , he remembered well enough the large number of warriors who had hp108assembled at the docks . There seemed to be comparatively few among his current hosts , and none at all  --  at least none in uniform  --  among those closest to the Ektun ruler , Zotz Mac . Perhaps this accounted for the relaxed attitude of the Ektun lords , who seemed to find nothing improper in smiling and nodding to those they recognized in the crowd , even though the formal speeches had already begun . Akbal ran his eyes along the line of men standing behind the canopied throne , fascinated by the sheer diversity of their faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some long and delicate and very like his own , and some had the blunt , aggressive features characteristic of the Yaxchilanis and the Sky Clan . Others  --  like that of Zotz Mac himself  --  were less easy to identify , seeming to blend a number of distinctive traits , each tempered and rendered less distinct by the others . This diversity was consistent with what Chan Mac had told Akbal about the origins of Ektun , and the various peoples who had helped to found its greatness : the early emigrants from Copan and the highlands , the refugees from Tikal and Uaxactun during the last Katun ii Ahau , the foreign merchants and warriors whom Akbal 's grandfather had identified as the Zuyhua and the Cauac Shield people . All of these had mingled their blood with that of the original Ektun clans , giving rise to the wealth and power that had built this city , and to the clans that ruled it today . The most prominent of these , Akbal had learned , were the Turtleshell and the Moon clans . The latter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time , during the reign of Bird Jaguar , when the Yaxchilani ruler had helped to arrange the accession of a Moon Clan member to the rulership of Ektun . Moreover , this Moon Clan ruler had been the son of a Sky Clan woman from Tikal , a daughter of the great Cacao Moon . The Moon Clan did not hold the throne of Ektun at the present time , but Chan Mac had related this history to Akbal so that he would be aware of his own blood relationship , through his mother , to this powerful clan . Chan Mac 's own mother was a Moon Clan woman , but his father came from the Turtleshell Clan , one of the oldest and largest of the Ektun clans . The current ruler , Zotz Mac , was from a collateral line within this clan , the same family into which Akbal 's great-aunt Box Ek had married so many years before . Akbal had been well aware of these relatives before he had even met Chan Mac , for Box Ek had made him memorize a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For that reason alone , he was grateful that his voice had finally returned , though Chan Mac had also made it clear that he would not allow his friend to hide in Ektun . He had already described many of the people Akbal would meet , and had half-convinced him that they would all be as friendly and admiring as Chan Mac himself . Akbal wanted to believe this , and he constantly reminded himself of how well he had done with the painters in Yaxchilan . But he was still very nervous . The household in which he had been raised had become subdued and reclusive after the death of his mother , and had not been given to entertaining large gatherings . Akbal remembered leaving most of the feasts he had attended in the middle , anyway , to go off somewhere by himself to draw . As a result , the twin arts of conversation and gracious gesture did not come naturally to him , and both times he had worked on commission for thep109ruler he had found the rarefied atmosphere of the court intimidating and distracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become Cab Coh 's assistant , a decision he had only begun to see as another kind of hiding . A stirring around him brought him back from his thoughts , to the realization that the speeches were finally concluding . Along with the rest of the group , he rose to bow once more before the ruler . Straightening up , he noticed that darkness had fallen outside , though the rain had not ceased . " Now we will eat , " Chan Mac said enthusiastically . " Now you will understand why I am not thin like you . " " You must be anxious to see your wife and family , " Akbal said politely , concealing his own anxiousness . " Will they be at this feast ? " " Everyone will be at this feast . We would not miss the chance to honor our brothers from Tikal and their wives . " " Your sister will be there as well ? " " Yes , of course , " Chan Mac said , observing Akbal 's interest with a knowing smile . " We will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon Clan feast , but they will be most pleased to meet you . I am sure of it . Only you must not be shy about discussing your ancestry , " he added , as if sensing Akbal 's need for advice and reassurance . " Especially around my mother and sister , you must not be shy . Let them know all of the important families to whom you are related . " Akbal frowned unconsciously . " They might think I was boasting to make up for my lack of rank , " he suggested , but Chan Mac shook his head sternly . " You established your rank in Yaxchilan . You are the Tikal Painter , the favorite of Shield Jaguar . You would be more impressed with yourself if you knew how rarely he shows his favor to anyone except another warrior . " " Must I also boast of my ancestry , then ? " Akbal asked plaintively . " It is not something I am used to . " " You will be , before tonight is through , " Chan Mac assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be , because my people are not envious like the Yaxchilanis . But they care deeply about a person 's background . Some , as you will see , more deeply than others , " he added significantly , taking Akbal firmly by the arm and leading him from the greeting hall . IT WAS not until late in the evening , though , well after the food had been cleared away , that Akbal finally laid eyes on Zac Kuk and her mother , the Lady Muan Kai . Messengers had been sent to them at intervals throughout the meal , and always the word had come back that they would soon be coming over from the Moon Clan feast , which was being held in one of the adjoining buildings . Since Chan Mac 's father , Batz Mac , did not seem concerned by the prolonged absence of his wife and daughter , Akbal had decided that there must be nothing unusual about it and had not allowed it to concern him either . There were enough new acquaintances to absorb his attention as it was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained Chan Mac 's wife , Kutz , and his three brothers , their wives , two of his grandparents , and a constantly shifting assortment of uncles and cousins . They had proven as considerate and attentive a group as Chan Mac hadp110promised , sharing their favorite dishes with Akbal and explaining how they had been prepared , joking with one another while they gave their guest time to warm to their company . Akbal took an immediate liking to Batz Mac , who was even shorter and rounder than his son , with a large belly and heavy jowls that shook when he laughed . He personally made all of the introductions , proudly describing Akbal as the Tikal Painter , a designation that invariably drew exclamations of recognition and respect from his listeners . Everyone wanted to hear of his meeting with Shield Jaguar and his impressions of Yaxchilan , and he might never have found the time to eat had Batz Mac not intervened frequently , sparing his guest the pressure of sustained questioning . Zac Kuk and her mother arrived trailing an entourage that included several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry and headwrapsof diplomats . From his place next to Batz Mac , Akbal recognized one of the men as a high-ranking member of the Tikal delegation , a nephew of Caan Ac . The man did not see him , however , since his attention  --  like that of the rest of the entourage  --  was centered on the small , trim figure of Zac Kuk . Akbal 's first impression of her was one of great vivacity and enthusiasm , conveyed by a dazzling smile and wide , wide brown eyes . But he was also struck by the immaculate simplicity of her attire , which consisted of a blue , ankle-length shift embroidered with a yellow , braidlike pattern along the sleeves and hem . A single strand of tiny jade beads hung around her neck , and her shiny black hair was tightly coiled on both sides of a central part . Her face was a perfect oval , the family roundness offset by high , prominent cheekbones and a small , flat nose that flared slightly at its tip , giving her an aura of perpetual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aura was accentuatedby the thick lashes that framed her eyes , hiding the fold in her eyelids and giving her the appearance of being wide-eyed with surprise and pleasure . Akbal knew that he was staring , and he knew that he should be paying more attention to the mother , who had scrutinized him closely when they were introduced . Zac Kuk had only given him a passing glance , and did not seem to be aware of his staring now . While her father was introducing the two men behind her to the other members of the circle , she bent to pay her respects to her brothers ' wives , touching their hair or garments and smiling to show her admiration . Akbal was tantalized and intrigued by that smile , those wide eyes , the manner that somehow seemed in keeping with the neatness of her attire , despite the apparent spontaneity of her greetings . She is undeniably beautiful , he decided , but could a smile so easy truly be sincere ? And why had she not smiled at him ? " You are from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Akbal tore his eyes away from Zac Kuk to look up at her mother . A commanding presence , taller than her daughter , with the same high cheekbones and wide eyes . These eyes , though , were probing , calculating , innately critical . " Yes , my lady , " he said politely . " My father is Pacal Balam , steward to the Ruler Caan Ac . " " And who is your mother ? " Muan Kal demanded without hesitation , giving no sign that she was impressed by Pacal 's position . Out of the corner of his eye , Akbal saw that the others were all watching him now , but he resisted the urge to sneak a glance in Zac K uk 's direction and kept his eyes on Muan Kal 's face.  | " My mother has gone to the ancestors , my lady . She was the Lady Ik Caan of the Sky Clan , the niece of our late ruler , Cauac Caan . " Muan Kal pursed her lips thoughtfully , looking from Akbal to her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before she could ask another question , though , she was distracted by the sudden movement of Zac Kuk , who had turned to whisper something to the men behind her . " Do not be rude , Zac Kuk , " Batz Mac said sternly . " If you have a question concerning our guest , you should ask it aloud . " Zac Kuk smiled at her father and shrugged innocently , apparently unembarrassedby his reprimand . " I merely wondered if the Jaguar Paw is not the clan of the Featherless Dancer , " she said simply , glancing from her father to Akbal , as if it made no difference who answered . " I do not know whom you mean , " Akbal confessed , and Zac Kuk turned once more to the men behind her . It was the diplomat from Tikal who spoke , smiling at Zac Kuk before turning to Akbal , whom he regarded with illdisguisedcontempt . " Perhaps you have not heard the recent news from Tikal , " he said disdainfully . " Balam Xoc , the Living Ancestor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high priest on the charge of deviating from the ceremonies . He had refused to wear feathers at the Tun-End Ceremony , claiming they had not been worn by our ancestors . " Several people around the circle laughed in astonishment , then hastily clapped their hands over their mouths when they saw how Akbal 's face had paled . " He is my grandfather , " Akbal said tightly , staring back at the diplomat with hard eyes . He felt suddenly exposed , conspicuous among the much shorter men on either side ; a " heron among frogs , " as Batz Mac had said jokingly , earlier in the evening . Now it seemed not humorous , but painfully accurate . Chan Mac , who was sitting directly across from Akbal , suddenly turned in his seat and looked up at the diplomat . " My friend has not heard this news . Nor have I. What was the result of this hearing ? " " I do not know , " the man admitted . " That is , the high priest has not yet announced his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defiant , claiming that he had been inspired by a vision . " " So he has not been punished in any way , then ? " Chan Mac inquiredpointedly . " He has not been reprimanded publicly or removed from his office ? " " He has not been touched , " the man conceded in a low voice . " Then we must assume , must we not , " Chan Mac pressed him , " that theexplanation he gave for his deviation was acceptable to the high priest ? Or atleast not deserving of condemnation ? " " I do not know what to assume , " the man said sullenly . " Then you should not have spoken , " Chan Mac snapped , and turned away from the man in disgust . He looked across at his father , who was shaking his head , saddened by the uncongenial turn the conversation had taken . Akbal sat stiffly upright beside him , his eyes hooded and his mouth drawn into a taut line , obviously not about to go on explaining his ancestry after the rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispering urgently to the Tikal diplomat and his companion , trying to persuade them not to leave in anger . Then a deep voice rose above the whispers of the women , and Kinich Kakmoo appeared at the head of the circle , accompanied by two older men wearing the distinctive red headwrap of the royal family . " Where is my friend Chan Mac ? " Kinich demanded gruffly . " I have come to meet his wife and family . " There was a moment of stunned silence while the people around the circle stared at the warrior , whose glittering teeth were exposed in a ferocious grin . Chan Mac rose to his feet and bowed gracefully in Kinich 's direction , spreadinghis hands in welcome . " May I introduce the Nacom Kinich Kakmoo , the man who led the warriorsof Tikal and Yaxchilan to victory over the Macaws . " " We are deeply honored , " Batz Mac asserted , bowing as far as his belly would allow in a sitting position . The others around the circle did likewise , each bowing a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No doubt you are all familiar with my companions , " Kinich said when he had heard every name . He gestured toward the men beside him , then toward Akbal . " Except for you , my brother . Yet these are our father 's cousins , the sons of the Lady Box Ek . " As he rose from his place , Akbal had the satisfaction of seeing genuine surprise on Zac Kuk 's face , and seeing the Tikal lord look away when she turned in his direction . He went up to the two men and bowed deeply before them . Then he straightened up , raising himself to his full height , his youthful face suffused with the solemn glow of vindication . " I bring you the humble greetings of your mother , my lords , " he said in a firm , clear voice . " And the greetings of her brothers , the Master of Craftsman Cab Coh , and Balam Xoc , the Living Ancestor of the Jaguar Paw Clan . " " You need not be so formal , " Kinich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveyed the greetings of our family , and told them of their mother 's health . They wish to speak to you about a commission . " " Come , sit with us , " Batz Mac interrupted , dispatching one of his wife 's servants for more balche and cacao and waving to his sons to make room around the circle . When everyone had finally been reseated , the Tikal diplomat and his companion had disappeared , and Zac Kuk and her mother were sitting across the circle next to Chan Mac , listening while Akbal conversed with his relatives . The two men wished to commission a painted bowl to commemorate their mother 's seventieth year , which would be completed in the year to come . They seemed to have heard a great deal about Akbal 's vase , and not only from Kinich ; apparently , the members of the Ektun delegation to Yaxchilan had been talking about it ever since their return . The men also knew of Akbal 's other work and spoke flatteringly of its quality , claiming to own several pieces themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Akbal murmured , keenly aware of the attention of the women across from him . " I would be most honored to paint this gift for you . But I will not listen to any talk of payment ; you must let me make this my gift to you . " The men insisted they could not hear of such a thing , citing their greater age and ability to pay , and claiming that Cab Coh whom they both knew  --  would feel they had taken advantage of his young kinsman . But Akbal was steadfast.  | " I am Cab Coh 's assistant and have the authority to accept commissions on my own . Besides , my lords , you must remember that it was to help raise my sister and me that the Lady Box Ek left her family here to return to Tikal . She was your gift to me , once . " The men were too affected by the sentiment to argue the point any longer , and they raised their bowls of balche in an emotional toast , pledging their gratitude and friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they also made Akbal promise that he would visit their homes and meet their families during his stay in Ektun . After they were gone , Akbal took another sip of balche to fortify himself before meeting the inquisitive gaze of Muan Kal . Chan Mac and Zac Kuk had moved a little aside and were having what appeared to be a rather heated conversation , and though Akbal was tempted to try to overhear , he knew he should not let anything distract him from what Muan Kal had to say . He felt he owed it to Chan Mac to make a good impression upon his mother , and the balche had long since broken down the restraints of shyness . He even felt slightly belligerent over the way he had been treated earlier , and he did not attempt to hide this from Muan Kal when he looked across at her and made a brief bow , inviting her to speak . " You must forgive me , my son , " she said quickly , as if she had had the words prepared for some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make the proper connections . I did not understand that you were the Tikal Painter . " " Perhaps you had been led to expect someone older , " Akbal suggested . " Your son and I were the youngest by far of the emissaries sent to Shield Jaguar . " " Perhaps , " Muan Kal allowed . " I have surely heard the highest praise for your skill . You must be offered many commissions . " " I receive my share , " Akbal said modestly . " I am surprised that you have not been asked to join the artists of the royal court , " Muan Kal observed shrewdly . " I have . I chose instead to work within my own clan , which allows me the freedom to accept the commissions I find most worthwhile . " " But are not the best commissions those that are offered by the ruler ? " " Often that is true , " Akbal admitted . " I am available , though , should the ruler desire my services . " " No doubt he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you performedfor him in Yaxchilan . My relatives among the Sky Clan have told me of the deep friendship that exists between Caan Ac and Shield Jaguar . " Akbal looked at her sharply , searching for signs that she was being sarcastic . But she seemed completely sincere , and he understood that at least some of the members of the Tikal delegation had discovered an explanation for the concession Caan Ac had made . " It was my privilege to serve them both , " he said simply , hoping to put an end to this line of questioning . He was tired of being examined by this woman , who seemed always to be searching for flaws . And he 's guest . The balche had enough of a hold upon him to make him want to say so , and perhaps Muan Kal sensed this , for she chose not to pursue the subject.  |p114Akbal  relaxed and reached for his balche bowl , then drew his hand back when he realized that Chan Mac and his sister had finished their conversation and were waiting to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seen earlier , her lips clamped together petulantly and her eyes narrowed almost to a squint . Spots of high color gathered on her cheekbones , making the rest of her face appear pale . " My brother has said that I must apologize to you , " she murmured in a toneless voice . " It was thoughtless of me to raise an issue that might be embarrassing to you . " Akbal looked back at her , remembering the smiles she had bestowed so easily on others , including the diplomat from Tikal . Now she would not even meet his eyes , and the reluctance of her apology was all too obvious . He felt a strong surge of dislike and had to restrain himself from responding sharply . " I was embarrassed only because of my ignorance , " he replied , in what he thought was an even tone . " But I respect my grandfather 's wisdom , and I do not like to hear him belittled . Especially not when he is correct . I have seen for myself , in the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Akbal realized too late that his voice had risen , taking on a tone that was almost scolding . It was what he should have said to the Tikal diplomat earlier , but he had not had the presence of mind . Or the balche to loosen his tongue . Zac Kuk was quivering where she sat , her eyes wide with anger and humiliation . Akbal immediately regretted what he had done , but he did not know how to back down without seeming foolish . " He can not accept an apology he has not heard , my sister , " Chan Mac prompted sharply , and Zac Kuk 's head jerked involuntarily . Tears suddenly appeared at the corners of her eyes , hanging tremulously on the ends of her luxuriant lashes . " Forgive me , " she blurted in a strangled voice , bowing low to hide her face from him . The blood rushed to Akbal 's face , and he spread his hands helplessly . " Yes , please ... do not ... " Her head still bowed , Zac Kuk was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry gesture of consent . " You must excuse my daughter , " Muan Kal said , as Zac Kuk rose and hurried off with her face still averted , trailed out of the room by two of the servants . " I did not mean to humiliate her , " Akbal said weakly . " She has too much pride , " Muan Kal asserted indignantly . " She can never apologize to anyone . " Akbal stared at the doorway through which Zac Kuk had disappeared , then around at the rest of the circle , who seemed not to have noticed the incident , or were pretending they had not . Catching his brother 's eye , Kinich raised his balche bowl in a salute from the other end of the circle . Akbal immediately did likewise , glad for the excuse to drink some more , and to try to wash away the memory of the tears he had caused . PULLING the curtain roughly aside , Chan Mac let the morning sunlight flow into the bachelor 's room , which was at the eastern end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over him and tried feebly to turn onto his other side . " Arise , Akbal , " Chan Mac said cheerfully , " it is late . I have already been to the palace to make my report to the ruler . He is sending someone to see you. , , " Water , " Akbal whispered , as Chan Mac knelt beside him and put down the tray he was carrying . He offered Akbal a steaming bowl , lowering his voice to a more compassionate level . " Drink some of this instead ; it will calm your stomach and soothe your throat . Water would only make you drunk again . " Akbal sat up groggily and took the bowl , which gave off a sharp , musty odor , the smell of bark and roots . The first taste made him grimace horribly , and Chan Mac laughed . " It is my wife 's preparation , and you will thank her for it if you can find the courage to drink it down . Or did you vomit out all your courage last night ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Akbal vowed hoarsely , and forced himself to empty the bowl , shivering with every swallow . " It made you bold enough last night , " Chan Mac observed drily . " My mother was very impressed with your poise in answering her questions . She sometimes has an unnerving effect on young men . " Akbal belched and shrugged , frowning as if the memory hurt his head . " I did not come here as a suitor , so I did not feel defensive . It is a good thing , too , for I doubt that your sister will ever speak to me again . " " She is not speaking to me today , " Chan Mac said easily . " But she will get over it . Come , let me show you where to wash . You have to prepare yourself for Zotz Mac 's representative . " Handing him a towel and a piece of soaproot from the tray , he led the way out into the sunlight , which was already hot . The rain had stopped sometime during the night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off wisps of steam in the glaring light . Akbal followed along obediently as Chan Mac left the terrace and passed through a small grove of copal trees . A descending series of V-shaped slashes had been cut into the trunk of each tree , and the thick white gum from which incense was made oozed slowly downwardfrom V to V. The resinous aroma of the gum filled Akbal 's nostrils and nearly made him gag , so he was relieved when they came out into the open again , onto a small , rounded bluff overlooking a ravine . In the center of the bluff was a shallow pool , a natural depression in the rocky ground that had been deepened to collect the rainwater . Spike-leaved yucca plants had been planted around the pool to provide a measure of privacy , and the pool itself was lapping over its edges from yesterday 's rainfall . Akbal quickly stripped off his loincloth and lowered himself into the water , lying on his back in order to submerge his entire body . Then a hand came down on the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up spitting and squawking . " I thought that would awaken some energy in you , " Chan Mac said in a satisfied voice , laughing when Akbal splashed water at him in retaliation . Then he sat beside the pool while Akbal washed , telling his friend about his interview with the ruler. ' lott Mac was with the delegation in Yuxchilan , " he explained , " so he hadp116seen your vase and heard all about your work with the other painters . I naturally embellished upon your achievements , and he asked me to extend his congratulations , noting that you are related to his own family . " Akbal dunked himself for one last time and stepped out of the pool , reaching for the towel Chan Mac held out to him . " Why is he sending someone to see me ? " " He had questions I could not answer on your behalf . He was puzzled by all the drawings you made in Yaxchilan . He wanted to know why you were so curious about the monuments , and I could not tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Akbal sat down on the towel , spreading his wet hair over his shoulders to dry in the sunlight . " I was not asked for a reason in Yaxchilan , " he said , showing some reluctance to explain . " If you do not wish to tell me  --  " " No ! I do , " Akbal corrected himself hastily . " But you must tell me if I should reveal this to the representative . " " I would want you to speak honestly to him . Unless you were acting under an order of secrecy ... ? " Akbal shook his head in negation . " I acted on my own , " he declared , then paused and searched Chan Mac 's face , as if afraid he might find some hint of scorn there . " There is a stone , in Tikal , " he said softly . " I hope to carve it someday , in honor of my clan . " " Yourself ' ? " Chan Mac asked incredulously . " You hope to carve it yourself ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chan Mac laid a reassuring hand on Akbal 's arm , his eyes slitted in a smile of delight . " Forgive me , my friend . Just when I think I have taken your measure , you prove to me that you are much larger than I will ever know . Ah , and my mother said to me , He seems very generous , but not truly ambitious .. " " Then you do not find it a peculiar ambition ? " " Mysterious , perhaps , " Chan Mac allowed . " But there have been stone carvers who attained high rank in Ektun , and not all so long ago . In Palenque , the home of my wife 's family , the sculptors were of such importance that they constituted a clan of their own . Besides , I do not doubt your ability to master whatever craft you turn your hand to . " " Should I tell this to the representative , then ? " " By all means . Only do not ask him if he finds it peculiar , " Chan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Painter , and let him draw his own conclusions . You are not the suitor of his favor , either . " Akbal winced at the reference to Zac Kuk and looked away for a moment , as if pursuing a thought he did not wish to share . But then he shrugged , picked up his loincloth , and began to dress himself for the interview . THE HOUSES of Batz Mac and his sons lay to the east of one of the ceremonial plazas , clustered on a narrow spit of land between a tree-filled ravine and a wider valley carved out by a tributary of the river . Stands of cedar , yaxche ,  |p117and  breadnut trees cast their shade over the long , rectangular buildings surrounding the single courtyard , which was wider at one end than the other . All of the buildings had thin walls and many doorways , and all except the family shrine  --  which had a flat masonry roof  --  had steeply pitched , thatched roofs . The family gardens lay outside the confines of the buildings , but the barrennessof the interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrubs planted in large pots , and small trees growing out of earthfilledwooden boxes . One corner of the courtyard had been turned into an artificial grove , and it was here , in the lower branches of a fig tree , that Zac Kuk kept her collection of pet birds . These included a toucan , a pair of scarlet macaws , and several parrots of various sizes and colors . Sitting in the top of the tree , and tied to the trunk by means of a long rope attached to his collar , was a spider monkey . When Akbal and Chan Mac entered the courtyard at its opposite corner , Zac Kuk was engaged in feeding her birds , attended by two elderly female servants , a small boy holding a basket of fruit , and three smiling young men , one of whom was the diplomat from Tikal . Following Zac Kuk 's example , the men were taking turns in offering bits of fruit to the birds , laughing at one another 's gingerly approaches to the loudly squawking pets . A pair of domesticatedturkeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feed that was being dropped , and the monkey hung down by his long slender tail , chattering at the people below . Akbal and Chan Mac stood watching this noisy scene for several moments before one of the young men noticed them and hailed Chan Mac , bowing to him across the courtyard . The second young man did likewise , but the Tikal diplomat pretended not to see them , and Zac Kuk lifted her chin and very deliberately turned her face away , showing them her back . Chan Mac seemed unaffected by the snub , laughing as he pointed out the monkey to Akbal and told him how Zac Kuk had found it as a baby and had given it the name Chuen . Akbal nodded without hearing a word , his eyes fixed on the back of Zac Kuk 's head . He was as much amazed by the pain of her rejection as he was hurt by it ; he had known she would turn away from him , after all . Yet her face  --  what he had seen of it  --  had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her sudden turn had left him stunned and bereft , as if he had been robbed of his sight , or of his reason for seeing . He could not bring himself to focus on anything else ; not the birds , not the monkey , not the other men , the suitors . He felt weak-kneed and nauseous , and swore to himself that he would never drink balche again . More people had suddenly appeared out of the doorways of the surrounding buildings , and a boy ran past them without stopping and entered the room belonging to Batz Mac . A few moments later , Batz Mac came out of the room in a state of great agitation , adjusting the apron of his loincloth beneath the swaying girth of his belly as he ambled up to his son . Akbal came out of his daze to see people beginning to line up around him and Chan Mac , and Muan Kal hurrying toward them across the courtyard . " You did not tell me , " Batz Mac said accusingly . " You said a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high priest . " " Ah Kin Tzab ? " Chan Mac said in surprise , widening his eyes at Akbal . " I was not told to expect a representative of his rank . "  | " For whom has he come ? " Muan Kal interrupted breathlessly , taking her place next to her husband . Batz Mac ignored her , waving to the latecomers to take their places in the ranks of the household . Then a small , stooped man in a white robe hobbled into the courtyard , accompanied by three solicitous apprentice priests . He was considerably older than Akbal 's grandfather , his leathery face creased with deep age lines , his hair white where it showed above his headwrap . He stopped in front of the group and raised his hand in blessing over their bowed heads . " Greetings , my children , " Ah Kin Tzab said , in a dry , slightly abrasive voice that hissed through the empty gaps in his teeth . " You must forgive the unexpectednature of this visit . I asked the ruler to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing Batz Mac the privilege of introducing him , then stepped forward to bow to the high priest , who studied him with an interest that seemed friendly . " I was told that you were very tall , and very young . Yes , and I can see a resemblance to the Lady Box Ek . Come , my son , I must speak with you privately ... " Batz Mac immediately jumped out to lead the way , and Akbal fell in a step behind the high priest , trying to match the old man 's shuffling gait without appearing to tower over him . As they passed the rows of reverent faces , Akbal realized that no one would turn away from him now , and he lifted his head with a renewed sense of self-importance . But then he saw Zac Kuk just ahead , her eyes lowered respectfully as Ah Kin Tzab drew even with her place in line . There was no guile in her face , and none of the frivolousness that had so offended him the night before . As Akbal 's shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide , unblinking eyes , and any thought of trying to impress her vanished from his mind . In that brief moment , which seemed to stretch on and on , he put his heart into his eyes and appealed to her to forgive him , to see that he was not a man who wished to hurt or humiliate her . Then he was past , having seen only her eyes , which had taken in his appeal with only the slightest indication of surprise . He wished immediately that he had shown more expression , perhaps even risked a smile . No one else would have seen it ; it would have been for her alone . On the other hand , perhaps she would have found a smile inappropriate , and him arrogant for attempting one under these circumstances . Perhaps he should not have looked at her at all . Unable to gauge the impression he had made , Akbal sighed in frustration , so loudly that both Batz Mac and Ah Kin Tzab looked back at him in surprise . " This will not be such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured him as Batz Mac ushered them into a small , empty room off the courtyard . Ah Kin Tzab gestured to Akbal to seat himself and turned to say a few words to Batz Mac , promising to visit with him after his business here was completed . Batz Mac went away smiling , and the old man sat down across from Akbal , who had managed to regain his composure . " I feel that I know you very well , Akbal Balam , " the high priest said without preliminaries . " I have heard about you from many different people , including some of the Yaxchilani priests . I know your family in Tikal as well . So I truly do not need to examine your character . If you wish , I will show you the monuments under my control , though I do not have the power to give you the freedom you were granted by Shield Jaguar . "  |p119Akbal  blinked , unprepared for such an easy acceptance . " I have done nothing to deserve this honor , my father , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust . " Ah Kin Tzab looked back at him steadily , his thin lips curling into a knowing smile . " You are wondering why I asked to see you if I did not need to question you . First I must know that I can trust your silence . You must promise me that you will repeat what I say to no one else , except your grandfather . " " You know my grandfather ? " Akbal blurted in surprise . " I met him once , several years ago . But first swear to me , Akbal , because it is of your grandfather that I wish to speak . " " You have my word , " Akbal said gravely . " By the blood of my ancestors , I swear I will speak of this to no one but him . " " Good , " Ah Kin Tzab said briskly . " I have heard that you defended your grandfather 's decision to wear no feathers at the Tun-End Ceremony . You have seen the proof he claims to have for this ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Akbal confessed , " and I can not speak to how it was reached . But I discovered , when I was repainting the books of our clan , that our ancestors wore no feathers on the monuments of the last cycle . I told this to my grandfather , though he appeared to know already . " " It is no wonder Ah Kin Cuy has not moved against him , " the high priest said thoughtfully , rubbing his narrow chin . " Tell me , Akbal : Did you see your grandfather dance at the ceremony before this one ? " " Yes . It was unlike anything I had seen before ; it made me proud to carry the blood of the Jaguar Paw . " " Did he seem greatly changed afterward ? " " Yes , " Akbal said without hesitation . " We have all been affected by the change in him . " " And is it true , as I have heard , that he has seized control of your clan 's affairs , and has used his power to defy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some would see it , " Akbal admitted reluctantly . " He has refused to accept any new promises until old debts have been paid . Even from Caan Ac himself . But he has not done this on his own ; he has had the support of our clan council . " " Not of your father , surely , " Ah Kin Tzab said shrewdly . " But no matter . One last thing : Do you feel , when you are near him , that he is a holy man ? A man with a vision ? " Akbal reflected for a moment , his brow furrowed with the effort of rememberingand judging what he had felt . He recalled the way Balam Xoc had spoken to him about his stone and , later , about the Zuyhua and the Cauac Shield people . He had spoken of the future , surely , but also of the past , as if in some way the two were indistinguishable to him . Akbal spread his hands in a gesture of humility . " I know only what the priests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is not enough for me to judge his holiness . But I feel his influence upon my life as I never did before . Is it not because of him that I am speaking to you ? " The high priest smiled in response , showing the gaps in his teeth . " Indeed it is . You must tell him that his actions are being watched here with great interest . We are aware of'fikal 's recent misfortunes , and of the conces/sions Caan Ac was forced to make to Shield Jaguar . We do not gloat over these things as some do ; we gain no strength from Tikal 's weakness . You have been to Yaxchilan , so you understand my meaning . " Akbal nodded cautiously , making sure he memorized every word . " No doubt you have already learned that the Moon Clan is very powerful , both here and in Yaxchilan , " Ah Kin Tzab continued . " They have aspirations toward placing one of their own on the throne of Ektun when next it becomes empty , and their candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , and I will support the man most fit to be ruler . But this must be our decision . We do not require the intervention of Shield Jaguar and Caan Ac , acting on behalf of their Moon Clan relations . " Akbal raised his eyebrows at this revelation , and Ah Kin Tzab shook a finger at him sternly to remind him of his oath . " I tell you this only for his benefit , so that he will know my interest is not idle curiosity . Tikal 's dependency is dangerous to others besides yourselves . I do not wish to see all of our young men wasting their lives in battles with the Macaws . " " I will tell my grandfather , " Akbal promised after a respectful pause , and the high priest nodded that he was satisfied . " I will go now , and tell your hosts of my decision , and of my liking for you . Perhaps Zac Kuk can still be persuaded that you are a worthy suitor . " Akbal 's mouth dropped open , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are closely related , " he explained , " and intensely interested in one another 's business . Everyone is aware of the daughters who are available for marriage , for the blood of the wife is as important here as that of the husband . It is a remarkable thing when a suitor reduces one of these women to tears . " " It was not my intention to humiliate her , " Akbal protested defensively , but the priest held up a hand and wearily waved away his alibi . " Nevertheless , it was your deed , " Ah Kin Tzab chided him . " And perhaps you should not be so quick to disown it . I am told that Zac Kuk acted badly , and that you were defending your grandfather when you spoke to her so sharply . There are those who think you acted quite correctly . " " But , " Akbal blurted , then could not go on , embarrassed by his desperate need to apologize . " But Zac Kuk is not one of them , " the high priest finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that we have not been fair to you , my son . You have been here less than a day and have had no time to consider your intentions . I will suggest to Batz Mac and his son that you be allowed a few days to adjust to Ektun before undertaking any further social obligations . Perhaps you will find a way to resolve this matter if left to your-self . " " You are kind to me , Father , " Akbal said gratefully . " There are many things I need to think about . " " You may begin now , " Ah Kin Tzab said , struggling to his feet and gesturingto Akbal to stay where he was . " I will send for you when you have rested sufficiently . " Akbal bowed deeply , and the high priest raised a hand over him in blessing . " May the spirits of your ancestors he with you , Akbal natant . May theyp121guide you and show you the way that is both correct and manly , the way that will bring honor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coh outside the craft house when the bearers from Yaxchilan arrived . There were two of them , broad-backed men with sinewy necks and shoulders . Each had a large , square , leather-wrapped bundle attached to the tumpline around his head , and their legs were spattered with mud from the journey . They approached Cab Coh with weary deference , one of them gesturing to the packs on their backs . " These belong to the Tikal Painter . " " Who would that be ? " Cab Coh demanded , waving a hand at the artisans working in the long building behind him . " I have many painters here . " " He means Akbal , Grandfather , " Kanan Naab suggested quietly , and both men nodded in confirmation . Cab Coh frowned and pulled on his ear , as if to chastise himself for not remembering . " Of course , " he murmured , though Kanan Naab knew that the designation meant nothing to him . Once he had reconciled himself to Akbal 's absence , he had avoided all further knowledge of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for secrecy had given him a convenient excuse for not asking , but he truly did not want to know . Anything to which Balam Xoc had given his blessing was bound to be tinged with controversy , and Cab Coh found it easier to appear old and absentminded than to involve himself in matters that might distress him . " Perhaps the bundles should be opened , " Kanan Naab prompted , as Cab Coh continued to ignore the sweating men . He frowned again , but let go of his ear . " No , they are Akbal 's property , " he decided . " If you would , my daughter , show these men to your brother 's room . His belongings will be safe there . " Kanan Naab nodded compliantly and led the men across the open area of the lower plaza , toward the bridge and stairs that climbed to the plaza above . Kanan Naab 's bench on the middle landing was occupied by a pair of young priests who were staying in her grandfather 's house , and they bowed to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearers close behind . The houses of Nohoch Ich and Cab Coh were to her right as she came into the upper plaza , and there were small groups of men and women waiting outside of both buildings , conversing quietly in the shade of the overhanging thatch . Kanan Naab nodded or waved to those who recognized her , then turned left and headed toward her father 's house . There were people sitting in the doorways of Balam Xoc 's house , just to the east , but the house of Pacal appeared deserted , two of its three doorways covered by curtains . Kanan Naab felt a pang of guilt every time she was confronted by this contrast , because although she lived in her father 's house , she was not cut off from the rest of the family the way he was . On the contrary , she had become the daughter of the house , and had made herself indispensable to Box Ek and the wives of Cab Coh and Nohoch Ich as they struggled to meetp122the demands of all the guests and visitors drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the need to expand , and to suggest that additional servants be hired , knowing intuitively that the clan had the means for this . She could feel the vitality that Balam Xoc had awakened in his people , and she assumed from this alone that they must be more prosperous , as indeed they were . Unlike the older women , she never doubted the value of this prosperity , or questioned its impact upon their lives , and this freed her to act with the authority and foresight that were needed . As she skirted the front steps of her father 's house , Kanan Naab comforted herself with the thought that its air of abandonment was deceptive . The curtains had been drawn at the request of her stepmother , Ixchel , who was suffering through the early months of her first pregnancy , after years of praying for a child . In time , Kanan Naab hoped , even the house of Pacal would show signs of new life and growth , and would share in the rebirth of the clan . Akbal had the bachelor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same room that Kinich Kakmoo had occupied before his marriage . Pulling aside the curtain that covered the single doorway , Kanan Naab instructed the bearers to deposit their loads on the dusty floor , waiting outside while they did so . Then she thanked them and pointed toward the open-sided cookhouse that stood behind her father 's house . " Tell the women that the Lady Kanan Naab has sent you to them . They will see to your hunger and thirst , and give you provisions for your journey back to Yaxchilan . " The two men murmured their thanks and went off , and Kanan Naab let the curtain fall back into place . Then she changed her mind and entered the room , a place forbidden to women when its occupant was present . But Akbal might not return for another month or more , and it seemed irresponsible to store the bundles without examining their condition . And indeed , a cursory examination of the tightly bound packs revealed traces of green mold growing in the seams of the leather wrapping . Once , Kanan Naab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking someone else 's permission . But she had too many other responsibilities now to waste time indulging her misgivings , especially when Cab Coh had dispensed with his by delegating this chore to her . Glancing around the sparsely furnished room , she spied a flint knife among the clutter of drinking bowls and carrying baskets in the corner . The knife was chipped and dulled from use , but it was sufficient to saw through the fiber ropes holding the bundles together . As she had suspected , the interior wrappings were heavilyspotted with mold , and there were incipient growths on the wooden binders of the drawings and the pieces of reed matting used to cushion the folded paper screens . Despite the need to air the drawings before they were ruined , Kanan Naab hesitated before actually opening one of them up , feeling that this would be a serious intrusion into Akbal 's affairs . He was a man now , and had gone to Yaxchilan as an emissary of the ruler . Perhaps these drawings were supposed to be kept secret , like the vase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep if these were not aired , she told herself finally , and opened the screen to its full length on top of the bundle . What she saw took her breath away , and made her stand back from the drawing . Then she slipped her handsp123under the stiff , two-foot screen and very slowly carried it into the light from the doorway . The drawing was so complicated , and so exquisitely detailed , that she could not grasp all of its elements at once , and was forced to examine it a little at a time . A woman wearing a feathered headdress and a long robe decorated with Kan crosses knelt in the righthand corner of the scene , holding a bowl in one hand while extending her other hand gracefully , her gaze fixed upward . Curling up from another bowl in front of the woman was the plated , looping body of a two-headed serpent , whose upper jaws gaped widely , reaching all the way to the single row of glyphs along the upper border . Emerging from the serpent 's mouth were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaded pectoral and a tall , spotted headdress . He looked down upon the kneeling woman , pointing at her with the short , sharply tipped spear he grasped in his hands . As soon as the full composition of the scene became clear to her , Kanan Naab realized that what was being depicted was the experience of a vision , the visitation of an ancestor . It could be nothing else , yet it was a woman who appeared to be the recipient of the vision . A shiver went through Kanan Naab 's body , and she was seized by the sudden conviction that she had been meant to see this drawing . Why else had it been the first to come to hand if not as a message to her , a glimpse of possibility ? And had she not heard her grandfathersay , only the night before , that he had seen a two-headed serpent before his first vision came to him ? Could such things be the result of mere coinci-dence ? Forgetting her earlier hesitation , she propped the screen up on its edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next drawing in the stack was similar in style to the first and portrayed a standing lord who held a flaming staff over the head of another kneeling woman . The woman was holding one end of a piece of rope up to her lips , the other end coiling into a woven basket in front of her . Only after she had carried the screen over to the doorway and examined it closely in the light did Kanan Naab see that the rope in the woman 's hands was studded with sharp thorns . Shuddering , she lifted a hand to her own mouth , feeling the moist , tender flesh of her lips and tongue . She knew that the priests and clan elders sometimes pierced their tongues and earlobes in acts of penance . But this was a woman , and not only that , a woman of high rank . What kind of place had Akbal gone to , she wondered in horror ; what kind of people practiced this form of bloodletting , and so openly ? Her certainty that she was meant to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong desire to flee this room immediately . She wanted to be sitting on her bench , alone , smelling the flowers and allowing her fears to melt away in the quiet . But the priests might still be there , or someone else who would want to know why she was upset . Kanan Naab realized how long it had been since anyone had seen in her face that she was troubled , or asked her to explain why . It had once been a frequent occurrence , a reflex she evoked even in strangers . This is no way for the granddaughter of Balam Xoc to act , she told herself ; he did not flee from what was shown to him . Summoning her resolve , she stood the screen up beside the first drawing and went back to unpack the rest . She did so as methodically as possible , opening and setting the drawings down inp124one motion , so that she would not be able to dwell on what she saw . But as she gradually filled up the floor space immediately around her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she could not avoid the images that leaped out at her eye : the bulbous noses and pouting lips of the lords and ladies ; the thick-thighed warriors who exchanged staffs or brandished Cauac scepters at one another ; a woman in a beautifully embroidered robe presenting the head of a jaguar to a gesturing lord ; a warrior hidden behind a Sun mask , threatening his captives ; still another woman with a rope to her lips , flanked by a seated man holding a long , sharpened piece of bone next to his thigh . By the time the last of the screens had been set out to dry and she had worked her way back to the doorway , she was exhausted . She sat down with her back against the doorframe and breathed deeply , trying to get the odors of mildew and painted lime paper out of her lungs and nostrils . The images of Yaxchilan , however , could not be banished from her mind so easily . She would have to tell her grandfather what she had done , and hope that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen . Even if he reprimanded her , she hoped he would explain . She had to know more about these women with their baskets , and bowls , and thorn-studded ropes . She had to know if visions required the shedding of blood . " Lady Kanan Naab ? " a voice called softly , outside the room . " Are you there ? " Kanan Naab rose wearily to her feet and stepped to the edge of the doorway . She had already recognized the voice as belonging to Yaxal Can , a young priest from the Serpent Clan who had done some service for her grandfather and had then developed an interest in her . Kanan Naab had so far done everything possible to discourage his interest , but at the moment she was glad that he had found her . " Come in , " she said , beckoning to him . " There is something you must see . " Yaxal Can was a short man , only a little taller than Kanan Naab herself , so he was forced to look up at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head at her offer . " It would not be proper . We are alone here . " Kanan Naab made an exasperated noise and stepped down to stand beside him . " Then look for yourself . I will wait here . " Yaxal Can vacillated for a moment , looking from her to the room in perplexity . He had already been told by Box Ek , in front of everyone , that Kanan Naab was " difficult " and " perverse , " and he was no doubt considering the wisdom of an outright refusal . Kanan Naab drew herself up and gave him her most challenging look , letting him know what such a denial would cost him in her eyes . She was slightly surprised at how much it pleased her when he nodded instead and went into the room without another word . He remained inside for a long time , and Kanan Naab could see him lifting one screen after another , holding them up to the light so that he could read the rows of tiny glyphs . Kanan Naab became aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required her attention , but she could not leave until she had heard Yaxal Can 's opinion . She had to restrain herself from interrupting him when he paused in the doorway to examine the first twop125drawings she had seen , but she managed to keep her silence until he stepped down beside her . " They are very well drawn , " he commented in a neutral tone . " How did they get here from Yaxchilan ? " " Two bearers brought them today . They were drawn by my brother Akbal . But what do they mean , Yaxal ? Where could he have copied them ? " " Come , " the young man said curtly . " We must not stand here like this . I will escort you to your father 's house . " " Perhaps you believe I should not have seen these things , " Kanan Naab suggested , making no attempt to move . " Perhaps you will think it proper to tell me nothing . " " I will tell you nothing under circumstances that might disgrace us both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow me to escort you from this place , I will tell you whatever I can . " " Do you promise ? " Kanan Naab demanded eagerly , but Yaxal had turned and started off , and she had to hurry to catch up , nearly tripping over her long skirt . Yaxal paused to let her regain her breath , his dark eyes softening as he looked at her . He had very clear eyes , she noticed for the first time . Serious eyes . " Yes , I promise that I will tell you , " he said earnestly . " I have vows that I must obey , but I would speak forever of anything else , if it allowed me the pleasure of your company . " Kanan Naab felt the heat rise to her face , and she quickly ducked her head and began walking again . Yaxal smiled to himself as he sprang to accompany her , but he said nothing more , waiting patiently for her curiosity to return . EktunTHOUGH HE SLEPT often and deeply during the first day and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little rest during the hours he was awake . He could think of nothing but Zac Kuk , and being away from her only heightened his obsession without bringing him any closer to resolving his feelings . She appeared in his dreams , which he could never remember clearly later , but which left him feeling aroused and feverish with longing for a long time afterward . He tried to draw a portrait of the face that hovered constantly on the edge of his consciousness , but a satisfying likeness eluded him completely , and he gave up when he caught himself on the verge of breaking his brushes in frustration . Finally it became so unbearable that he dressed himself and went to the courtyard , determined to find her and make her forgive him . He had no idea what he was going to say , hoping somehow that desperation would supply him with the right words to make her bend , and accept his apologies , and let him look upon her again . He was ready to be humiliated  --  to humiliate himself  --  if that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got there . Zac Kuk 's birds perched somnolently in the shade of their tree , appearing to have already been well fed . Akbal stood uncertainly for a few moments , feeling foolish and exposed . Thenp126a twig fell at his feet , and he glanced up to see the spider monkey hanging by its tail from a high branch directly above him . But the monkey was paying no attention to him . It had a polished piece of mirror stone cupped in the long fingers of one hand , and it was staring intently at its own reflection . He was staring , Akbal realized abruptly , noticing the monkey 's erected penis , which hung down behind his legs like a stiff pink pod . Akbal felt a painful shock of recognition , reminded of how he had been staring at his own reflection in the bathing pool , where he had gone to cool the lingering ardor of his dreams . His scalp prickled with shame , yet he also felt intensely relieved that he had not come upon Zac Kuk in his present state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , grateful to escape unseen , with what little remained of his dignity . KINICH FOUND his brother out on the bluff behind Batz Mac 's house . Akbal was sitting with his back to the pool , staring down into the ravine below . He took his eyes away for only a moment as Kinich quietly took a seat beside him , then continued his staring . Kinich looked in the same direction , searching for the object of his brother 's rapt attention . But there was nothing to be seen except jungle . The lush green banks of vegetation seemed bleached and indistinctin the bright sunlight , leaves and branches blending together behind a wavering film of heat and vapor . Tiny birds flitted in and out of the cloud of foliage without causing a ripple , their brief calls lost in the constant , vibrating trill of the locusts . " What do you see ? " Kinich asked finally , unable to locate anything of significance in the scene . " Just the shadows and shades of color , " Akbal said in a dreamy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They form shapes and patterns of their own . " Then he let his shoulders slump and rotated his head on his neck before turning to face Kinich , who was examining him skeptically . " Forgive me , my brother , " Akbal said in a normal voice . " It is a technique that Cab Coh once tried to teach me , a way of looking without trying to see . I was never successful at it , because either I would get impatient or my mind would wander . But I have found it useful , these last days , because I have wanted my thoughts to wander . " " You have , " Kinich echoed doubtfully . " And where have they taken you ? " " Many places . Back to Yaxchilan , and the things I learned there . And to Tikal , both the Tikal we know and the one that existed in the time of our ancestors . I have also returned to my childhood , to the time when our mother was still alive . " Kinich grunted , deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What can you remember of that ? You were , what  --  six when she died ? " " Six , " Akbal agreed . " But I was remembering a time when I could not have been more than three or four , because Kanan Naab was still an infant . I remember our mother taking the two of us to visit Grandfather , who was always sitting in a darkened room by himself . He was so silent , and so sad , that I was frightened of him at first . But Mother would pretend that nothing was wrong and would give him Kanan Naab to hold , and of course she would start to cry . Then Balam Xoc would have to rock her and sing songs to distractp127her attention , and soon he would forget about being sad and would play with me , as well . " " Yes , I remember that , " Kinich said slowly . " She took me , once , but I was too restless . Grandfather had lost his wife and his eldest son within the same year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid that he might follow them to the Underworld , so strong was his sorrow . " " Yet Mother cured him , " Akbal said with quiet pride . " Before she was taken herself , only a few years later . " " You do not have to remind me , " Kinich said irritably . " Why do you want to dwell on these morbid thoughts ? " " Because I have forgotten them for too long . It was after Mother died that Grandfather became the Living Ancestor , and all but disappeared from our lives . It was then , as well , that I became the Painter . " " We were all affected by her death , " Kinich assured him . " Why does this seem like such a revelation to you ? " " Because I have just begun to realize how much Grandfather has changed , " Akbal explained , undaunted by his brother 's growing impatience . " He is no longer a man who would grieve in darkness , needing women and children to comfort him . He comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are . Has he not touched your life , Kinich ? " Kinich grunted uncomfortably and frowned . " I can not forget how he touched our father 's life . And he has persuaded the clan not to supply the ruler with the full quota of warriors he requested . I do not find his touch as pleasant as you do . " " It is no longer merely a matter of our own family , " Akbal told him gravely . " You have heard that he danced without feathers at the last ceremony , and that he was summoned by the high priest ? " " I pay no attention to rumors , " Kinich said stubbornly . " He was bound to bring trouble upon himself with the things he has been saying . " " He has claimed that he was given a vision , and I believe that he was . I have seen for myself that what he is saying is true . " " What do you know of visions ? " Kinich demanded . " You are a painter , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Yaxchilan , " Akbal said calmly , " and to a certain Tikal warrior , who did not feel the Yaxchilanis were worthy of his ruler 's respect and confidence . I saw for the first time how Tikal was regarded from the outside , and it did not make me confident about our city 's future . " " And you think that Balam Xoc 's antics will remedy the situation ? " " I think he has seen the source of our problem , " Akbal insisted . " I think he means to lead us back to the ways of our true ancestors . " Unable to sit still any longer , Kinich got up and strode out to the end of the bluff and back , clenching and unclenching his blunt , battle-scarred hands . He stood looming over Akbal , huffing audibly through his nose . " Is it so easy for you to disown the ruler ? " he inquired angrily . " We also carry the blood of the Sky Clan in our veins , no matter what Balam Xoc says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking up , " and neither would I. But the Sky Clan people were foreigners to Tikal , and their rites were different from our own . Why should we adopt the rites of the Zuyhua when we did not adopt their weapons ' ? "  | " Foreigners ! " Kinich spat , stamping his foot in disgust . " I do not know what has come over you , Akbal , to make you believe such nonsense . Perhaps you have softened your brain with too much staring at nothing . " Akbal also rose and stood face to face with Kinich , forcing his brother to look up at him . " You are older than I am , Kinich , " he said in a low voice , " and braver . But you are wrong to mock our grandfather 's wisdom . He is showing us the way to regain the dignity we have lost . " Kinich abruptly turned away , then spun back and grabbed Akbal roughly by the arm . " I have lost none of my dignity , Little Brother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so . " Akbal tried to jerk his arm away , but Kinich held him fast , crushing down with his fingers . Akbal 's knees buckled , but he refused to cry out , gritting his teeth against the pain . Then Kinich remembered himself and abruptly let him go . " I came here to tell you that your relatives still await your visit , " the warrior said in a husky voice . " But I can see that you have your own sense of obligation now . Do what you will , then ! " Turning on his heel , Kinich stalked off , leaving Akbal to stare after him , rubbing uselessly at his arm , alone once more with his thoughts . AHKINTZAB had begun his tour in the southernmost plaza of the city , where the oldest Ektun monuments stood before temples long in disuse . The high priest was no lonely , garrulous caretaker like those in Yaxchilan , and he had used these ancient stones to test the depth and sincerity of Akbal 's interest , making him absorb a wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he allow Akbal to make more than brief charcoal sketches of the monuments and temples they visited . In some places , he would not permit him to draw at all . Yet the old man 's health required that he rest frequently , so they would settle themselves in one of the clan houses , where he would allow Akbal to paint more elaborate and detailed copies of the things he had sketched . Ah Kin Tzab sat beside him while he worked , as much to judge and criticize as to assist , for it was important to him that Akbal have a coherent understanding of what he drew , and that his representations be accurate . Akbal submitted to this discipline without complaint , grateful for the chance to dwell on something other than his longing for Zac Kuk . And the quality of the Ektun sculpture was superb , much more graceful than anything he had seen elsewhere . Here , too , there were warriors , women , and captives on the monuments , in a great variety of poses . Yet the sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was nothing similar to the bloodletting scenes and visionary rites depicted on the Yaxchilan lintels . Instead there were scenes of lords scattering grain in divinationand crowned figures seated serenely within niches , carved in such deep relief that the head and upper body stood almost free of the background . The monuments had been erected at five-tun intervals , marking the Hotun-  --  d and commemorating the various rites and duties performed by the ruler in power.  |p129When  one ruler died , a new series of monuments would be begun for his successor , often in conjunction with a different temple in another part of the city . By slow degrees , Akbal and the high priest worked their way north , climbingseveral levels to the temple plaza currently in use . Four carved monuments stood in a row in front of the main temple pyramid , which had been built against the side of the hill behind it . Two more monuments flanked the broad staircase leading to the elaborately stuccoed shrine above , and the only monumentso far erected by the present ruler , Zotz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the shrine . Akbal sketched this last monument late in the afternoon , with the sun shining down upon his back . He was tired and hungry and dizzy from having endured the day 's heat , but he stayed in front of the towering stone slab for as long as Ah Kin Tzab would allow , and he prevailed upon the priest to sit with him while he made a true copy afterward . " The resemblance to Zotz Mac is quite remarkable , " Akbal said admiringly , adding a layer of shadow to the outline of the figure to indicate the depth of the relief . When Ah Kin Tzab did not respond , Akbal hastily went on , fearing that he was losing the old man 's attention . " It will be time soon , will it not , for him to record his achievements as a warchief ? " The high priest 's head came up with surprising quickness , his narrowed eyes showing that he did not consider this a matter for casual questions . Akbal began to apologize , but the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glancing around at the entrances to the room . " That is another reason I am concerned about Tikal 's dependency , " he confided in a low voice . " Zotz Mac has so far resisted Shield Jaguar 's desire to have us join Yaxchilan in a full-fledged campaign against the Macaws . But he is a brave man , and he will want to test himself against an enemy , as is required of the ruler . I do not wish , however , to see him driven beyond the bounds of what is necessary and useful in this regard . You have seen how much attention Shield Jaguar pays to the sculpture of his city , Akbal . I can assure you that he pays as little attention to the administration of his city 's resources . He believes that he can always take what he needs in conquest . I have lived too long and seen too much to allow my people to entertain such a dangerous delusion . " A serving woman came in bearing a tray of food and drink , and they fell silent as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ah Kin Tzab gestured brusquely at Akbal 's painting . " Put that away for now , " he commanded . " I will help you with the glyphs later . Now we must eat and talk of other things . Like the commissions you have been accepting in such abundance . Why have you taken on all this work , when you have this stone of yours to carve ? Or have you reconsidered your grandfather 's commission ? " Akbal smiled tolerantly , reconciled to the fact that nothing he did in this city was a secret for long . " Reassessed , perhaps , " he allowed , gesturing toward the painting spread out to dry beside him . " Before I came here , I did not know that carvings like these even existed . It could he years before I might be ready to carve something as fine . "  | " It is good to see that you have not lost all of your humility , " Ah Kin Tzab said drily . " But perhaps you have another motive , as well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to establish a household of your own . " " Perhaps , " Akbal admitted . " If you are referring to the daughter of Batz Mac , however , I have not spoken to either her or her father . " " She continues to shun you ? " the priest asked , and Akbal gave him a sardonic look . " Am Ito pretend , Father , that you do not know ? She is cordial to me now , at least . She has decided to blame Chan Mac , rather than herself or me . " Ah Kin Tzab examined him silently , his deep-set eyes glinting with shrewd amusement . " I admire the way you have regained your composure , Akbal , but perhaps you have done so too thoroughly . A lack of emotion is seldom an advantage to a suitor . I must impress upon you that Zac Kuk has more influence over the choice of her husband than would a daughter of Tikal . And her mother has as much power as Batz Mac , for she carries the blood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am aware of this . But there are already enough who will laugh with her , and chatter like one of her birds . I would happily have done so myself , once , but I can not do so now . It would not be true to the kind of life I have to offer her . I am the grandson of Balam Xoc , and he has made me part of something much larger than myself , perhaps even larger than my clan or my city . Zac Kuk must understand this , as well . " " She is not as frivolous as she appears , " Ah Kin Tzab warned . " So you must be careful of what you reveal . Anything that passes to her mother will go directly to the Moon Clan . " " I have not forgotten my oath , " Akbal assured him . " But I am also praying that she will not hear me frivolously . " " She knows that you spend time with me , just as she knows that I do not give my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your time , Father , and I know how it adds to my status in your city . But there is one other favor I would ask of you . " Ah Kin Tzab raised his eyebrows in mock indignation . " You do not linger over your gratitude , Akbal Balam . What is it , then ? " " Could you see that the Lady Muan Kal hears of my commissions , if she has not already ? " Akbal asked . The high priest smiled and gestured to the bowls in front of them . " Eat , Suitor , " he said gruffly . " Your presumption reassures me ... " HAVING STAYED up late into the night talking to Chan Mac , Akbal was slow in rising the next morning , and by the time he had bathed and dressed himself , the bright sunlight with which the day had begun had been obscured by a fast-advancing bank of clouds . The sky was growing progressively dark and ominous , and the warm air was so dense with humidity that Akhal could see his breath in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thunder could be heard in the distance , giving promise of a serious storm . Akhal was remindedthat the rainy season should begin in earnest any day now , whichp131reminded him in turn that his time in Ektun was growing short . The Tikal delegation could not remain here for very much longer and expect to use the trails that led eastward through the jungle . He still had not had a chance to explain himself to Zac Kuk , though he had felt he was making headway the night before , until the Lady Muan Kal had joined the conversation . He had been telling Zac Kuk , Chan Mac , and Chan Mac 's wife , Kutz , about his memory of his mother , hoping to lead gently into the subject of his grandfather . Zac Kuk had seemed genuinely sympathetic , on the verge of finally shedding her wariness toward him . But then her mother had appeared , and Akbal had seen Zac Kuk 's attention become guarded and reluctant , her interest in him receding steadily as Muan Kal led him off on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Akbal later that Muan Kal had recently become his active supporter , which had been enough in itself to stir Zac Kuk 's resistance , since she and her mother seldom agreed on the subject of what was good for her . Chan Mac had suggested that he seek out Zac Kuk on his own and speak to her directly , pointing out that the Tikal diplomat and most of the other suitors were engaged in the final round of trade negotiations with the Tikal delegation and would not be around to get in his way . Akbal was determined to give this a try after he had eaten , but his plans changed abruptly when he entered the courtyard and found the entire household in an uproar . Zac Kuk was standing beneath the fig tree in the corner , waving her arms and shouting at the servants , who were scurrying frantically from house to house , as if searching for something . There was a protracted roll of thunder as Akbal crossed the courtyard , and the parrots on the branches behind Zac Kuk squawked harshly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commotion . Zac Kuk herself began shouting at him before he could ask what was wrong . " Chuen has escaped ! " she cried , holding up the free end of the rope . " You must help me find him ! He will be eaten by the snakes and jaguars ! " " Which way might he have gone ? " Akbal asked , and Zac Kuk immediately turned and started for the gap between the buildings at the eastern end of the courtyard . Akbal hurried after her , glancing up at the sky , which was rapidly turning the color of pitch . " There is a storm coming , my lady , " he said as he overtook her and they left the courtyard together . " Perhaps you should get a cloak and hat . " " There is no time , " Zac Kuk insisted , leading him past the freshly planted family garden and onto a narrow path that disappeared into a stand of breadnuttrees . She did not pause to scan the branches overhead , continuing up over a ridge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built up over the low plain on either side , which was thickly carpeted with sawgrass and the fresh green stalks of new reeds . The open water of a swamp was visible off to the left , but the plain on the right quickly gave way to a high , dense thicket of berry bushes . Zac Kuk stopped abruptly and pointed at the thicket . " Look there , " she commanded breathlessly . " He is very fond of berries . " Akbal had taken two steps off of the path when a loud crack of thunder in the near distance made him stop and look up at the sky . As he did so , he felt his sandaled feet sink into the soft ground and water squish up between his toes . Looking a few feet farther ahead , he saw that what looked like solidp132ground was really a tangle of vines and water lilies floating on the surface of an unseen swamp . He realized at the same time that it was too early in the season for there to be berries on the bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw his suspicions confirmed in her eyes as he stepped back onto the path and faced her , shaking his head slowly . " No , my lady . Unless you have lost a crocodile instead of a monkey , he has not gone this way . " Zac Kuk 's eyes widened with anger , and she confronted him with her fists wedged against her hips . " Even in my distress , you taunt me ! You are the most arrogant young man I have ever met . " " Then we are well matched , my lady . I came to help you find Chuen . But if you would prefer that I jump into this swamp instead . . . ? " He looked at her inquiringly , showing his willingness to jump . " Do what you wish , " Zac Kuk snapped , turning away from him and continuingalong the path , which could be seen to follow a curving line across the plain before climbing toward a group of heavily forested hills . Akbal trotted after her , again looking up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in sporadic bursts . Zac Kuk was no longer pretending to search , seeming to have her eyes fixed on some destination in the hills ahead . The sky was now so dark that Akbal lost all hope of reaching the cover of the trees in time , and then he could hear the rain advancing upon them , making a sound louder than the thunder , as if the earth were being pelted with a shower of heavy stones . Zac Kuk tried to stop when she saw the rain sweeping toward them in a solid grey sheet , and she skidded on the muddy path and nearly lost her balance . Akbal caught her by the elbows from behind and turned her into him , pulling her against his chest and bending his head over hers in an effort to shelter her from the rain . Then the water hit them , cascading down in a torrent so fierce and overwhelming that it robbed them of breath and sensation and drove them to their knees in the mud .. . Akbal was aware at first only that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , leaving him in a numbed state of shock . Then he became aware of his arms wrapped tightly around Zac Kuk 's back , and of hers around him , and of the warm , pliable body pressed fully against his own . The thin layer of sodden cloth between them seemed to have melted into his own skin , and he could feel the imprint of her breasts upon his chest so clearly that he could have drawn them . A flash of heat coursed through him , and blood rushed to his loins , stiffening the tangled folds of his loincloth . He was afraid that Zac Kuk would feel the rising of his desire , yet more afraid to move and risk her slipping from his embrace . The mere thought made him tighten his hold around her back , and his breath caught in his throat when he felt her squeeze him in return , molding their bodies together . The rain was still falling steadily , but neither of them noticed the water sliding off of their slick , warm skin . Finally they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only their knees touching . Zac Kuk 's long black hair had come completely uncoiled and hung plastered against her neck and shoulders ; her shift clung to thep133contours of her body , the outlines of her nipples and the points of her pelvis clearly visible through the cloth . Akbal felt similarly naked , his soaking loinclothoutrageously distended , standing up like a staff between his thighs . Yet he felt no shame or embarrassment as he watched Zac Kuk 's eyes travel over his body . Though utterly disheveled , she seemed more beautiful to him than ever , the alertness of her gaze accentuated by her wet lashes , which surrounded her eyes like black spikes . There was no amusement or scorn in her expression as she slowly raised her eyes to his face , opening herself fully to his inspection . As their eyes met , Akbal felt himself being drawn into another kind of embrace , a joining of spirits that made his heart swell with emotion . He realized suddenly that the smile he had yearned for so passionately meant little compared with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eagerness and her fear , and trusting him with both . Swallowing heavily , Akbal reached out with one long arm and laid his hand on her cheek , staring raptly until Zac Kuk smiled and lowered her eyes in modesty . Rising to his feet , Akbal helped her up , and steadied her while she removed her sandals , which would be useless in the mud . He took them from her and removed his own , tying them all together by the straps . " Let us go find Chuen , " he suggested , and Zac Kuk gave him a small , fleeting smile , as if surrendering a secret , and started up the slippery path toward the hills . Soon they were under the cover of the tall trees , and the footing improved , allowing them to climb the slope without sliding or grabbing for branches . Akbal walked by Zac Kuk 's side whenever the trail was wide enough , saying nothing but letting his eyes rest on her face , as if to absorb every feature into his memory . Twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical laugh drift back to him as he picked himself up off the ground and went after her . The trail brought them finally into a clearing in the trees , and Akbal could see the sky overhead , with breaks beginning to appear in the clouds . In the center of the clearing was a broad , deep pool , fed at its far end by a stream that tumbled down from a cave in the rocky hillside above . The water fell from ledge to ledge in white skeins , splashing noisily into the pool below , and flowering vines hung down on both sides of the waterfall , their leafy tendrils curling up just above the surface of the pool . Log benches were set at intervals among the banks of ferns surrounding the water , and huddled on a branch above one of these was the forlorn figure of Chuen , his black hair matted against his spindly body , his long arms wrapped nearly twice around himself . He chattered excitedly and jumped down into Zac Kuk 's arms , trailing the long rope that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the monkey cuddled against Zac Kuk 's breast , swiveling his furry head to stare at Akbal with big black eyes . When Zac Kuk also looked up at him , Akbal reached out and touched the rope attached to Chuen 's collar . " I am flattered , my lady , " he said , and Zac Kuk shrugged dismissively , shifting the monkey in her arms . " You are still an arrogant young man . " " Could I hope to he worthy in your eyes if I were not worthy in my own ? " Akbal asked mildly . " Perhaps if I were truly arrogant , I would not care so much about your opinion of mc . But I do care , Zac Kuk , as deeply as your mother cares about my ancestry and prospects . "  | " Why should you care about my opinion ? " she replied with exaggerated weariness . " You have already won over my mother and father and brother . " " I am not asking any of them to live with me in Tikal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my connections to the Sky Clan , and by the reputation I earned in Yaxchilan . She thinks that these things will assure my future success in Tikal . But it is not as simple as that . " Zac Kuk squinted at him curiously , absentmindedly stroking Chuen 's head . " Because of your grandfather ? " she asked finally , and Akbal nodded , pleased by the thoughtfulness of her tone . " Primarily because of my grandfather , but also because of the relations that exist between our clan and that of the ruler . Only my father , and perhaps my brother , Kinich Kakmoo , truly enjoy Caan Ac 's favor . " " But you are the Tikal Painter , " Zac Kuk protested in disbelief . " Surely , you must be his favorite as well . " " Because of how I pleased Shield Jaguar ? " Akbal suggested ruefully . " That was not Caan Ac 's true intention in sending me to Yaxchilan , despite what your mother wishes to believe . I do not expect to be received with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is possible that before very long , the people of my clan will not be welcome in the ruler 's court . " " You have not told any of this to my mother , " Zac Kuk said , more incredulousthan accusing . " No , " Akbal admitted in a low voice . " But you may tell her if you wish . I do not know that this will happen , and I pray that it might never occur . But my grandfather 's challenge to the ruler is a serious one , and it will not be ignored forever . " " Why do you tell me this ? " Zac Kuk demanded , bewildered and angry . " If my mother were to hear any of it , she would never allow me to marry you . " Akbal blinked , his eyes clouded with pain at the possibility . His voice quavered when he could bring himself to speak . " Then I will have hurt only myself . But I could not have you come to Tikal believing that all is peaceful there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is here . I could not bear to see you weep again , or have you think me cruel and deceitful . I would rather suffer the consequences of my honesty here , and leave you free to choose a more suitable man . " Akbal choked on the last words and barely got them out , too miserable to appreciate his own nobility . He had sincerely wanted to give her an honest choice , but he had not meant to paint such a bleak picture of his prospects in Tikal . He should have told her of the holiness of his grandfather 's task , and of his belief that it would lead the Jaguar Paw Clan to greatness . He should have told her of the good things her life would hold , and of how she would be loved and respected . He should have begged her to trust him and be his wife . Zac Kuk regarded him skeptically for a moment , then put the reluctant Chuen back up on his branch and walked slowly to the edge of the pool , gazing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sunlight illuminated the waterfall , creating tiny rainbows in the spray . Akbal came up beside her , his muscles clenched against the anxious trembling in his limbs . But when Zac Kuk finally looked up at him , her eyes were wide and warm , and spoke only of the embrace they had shared on the path.  | " I am pleased that you honor me with the truth , " she said quietly . " But is it not too late for me to choose another ? " Nearly sobbing with relief , Akbal let his joy burst free in a smile that seemed to lift him off the ground . He took Zac Kuk 's hand and pressed it against his chest . " With all my heart , I pray that it is , " he whispered fervently . " For surely , it is too late for me ... "  |p139THE  MEETING of the Jaguar Paw Clan Council had been called at the request of Pacal Balam , who carried a message and an invitation from the ruler . The message concerned the promotion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invitation was to the feast Caan Ac was holding in honor of his new warchief , who would return the next day with the rest of the Tikal delegation . The ruler was certain , Pacal said , that the lords of the Jaguar Paw Clan would wish to be present at this feast , to share in the glory of their brave kinsman . A few voices were raised in approbation when Pacal had completed his presentation , but most of the men in the chamber waited silently for the response of the Living Ancestor . Balam Xoc stared back at his son for a moment , then reared up on his haunches and grunted rudely , a loud , guttural sound that echoed off the vaulted ceiling and seemed to flatten the men 's ears against their heads . " You are pleased by your son 's sudden rise , Pacal ? " he inquired drily . " Should I be sad ? " Pacal retorted evenly . " He is the first nacom from our clan in many years , and the youngest ever to hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will receive little respect from the other nacoms . But you know this . You know that Caan Ac only uses him to divert attention from the concessions he made to Shield Jaguar . " " Perhaps I am not as skeptical of the ruler 's motives as you are , " Pacal said coolly , looking around at the other men . " I would still ask the council if Kinich Kakmoo will receive our respect . "  | " Tell me first of your other son , " Balam Xoc insisted . " What is planned for the Tikal Painter ? Is he also invited to his brother 's feast ? " " He does not have sufficient rank ... " " Why should that matter for a brother ? Especially one who served the ruler so well in Yaxchilan . Is he not also owed some respect ? " " I will speak to him myself , " Pacal said tightly . " He understood the nature of his task when he accepted it . " " Did he truly ? Perhaps you would explain to the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruler needed it performed . Like me , they have no doubt heard many false rumors concerning Akbal 's conduct in Yaxchilan . They should know whether he has earned the ruler 's ingratitude . " " I can not concern myself with rumors , " Pacal replied in an exasperated tone . " I requested this meeting to inform you of the high honor being extended to Kinich Kakmoo , and to solicit your attendance at his feast . I am not at liberty to discuss these other matters before the council . " Balam Xoc glanced up and down the line of seated men and bared his teeth in a sardonic smile . " Perhaps I must tell them myself , then . Unless I am the only one who thinks these matters worthy of discussion . . . ? " " I have not heard these rumors , " Cab Coh interjected with seeming innocence , " but I must know what my assistant has done . " " I am also interested , Pacal , " Nohoch Ich agreed gravely . " I have heard contradictory things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others claim that he deliberately sought to embarrass the ruler . The latter is a serious charge . " " Well ? " Balam Xoc demanded , but Pacal merely bowed , indicating his inability to reply . " I have said all that I may on this subject . I will leave you to decide for yourselves if you will accept the ruler 's invitation . " Pacal turned abruptly and left the chamber , causing the torches to flicker with the wind of his departure . There was a long silence after he had gone , and then Nohoch gestured for Balam Xoc to speak . " The men of whom we speak are my grandsons , " Balam Xoc told them bluntly , " but that has no bearing on how they must be judged . One is to be made a nacom and feasted by the ruler ; the other is to be scorned and slandered , his service unrewarded . To which should we give our respect and support , then : the one who is honored above his deserts , or the one who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common experience in our dealings with the ruler and the Sky Clan ? " Balam Xoc let the question hang in the air while he scanned the heavily shadowed faces at the ends of the room . " I , too , will leave the decision to each of you , " he continued . " You may accept the ruler 's invitation if you see fit , or you may attend the feast I will hold in my own house in honor of Akbal Balam . The choice is yours to make freely . But first I must tell you what Pacal would not . I must tell you of the concessions Caan Ac made to Shield Jaguar , and of the part Akbal was made to play in this . I must tell you how he came to he known in Yaxchilan as the Tikal Painter ... "  |p141AKBAL  SAT alone in the room that had been given to him , a back room away from the celebrating going on out in the plaza . He had just succeeded in shutting out the muffled sounds of laughter and singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , soft and near , calling to him from the other side of the curtained doorway . He recognized the voice of Porn Ix and called to his aunt to enter , averting his eyes from the light that flooded in at the parting of the curtain . " Will you not join us , Akbal ? " Porn Ix asked , blinking as she located Akbal on the floor , sitting cross-legged among his packs . She glanced past him , surveying the emptiness of the dimly lit room with genuine dismay . " There are not so many warriors now , " she added encouragingly , " and it is quieter . " " You are kind to think of me , my lady , " Akbal said politely . " But I would prefer to be alone . " Porn Ix nodded but did not turn to go , taking a moment to rearrange the folds of her long skirt as a pretext to sitting down across from him . She was his father 's older sister and bore a marked resemblance to Pacal , though her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grey . Akbal did not know her well , for she had married into a prominent Uaxactun family before he was even born , and had made only infrequent visits to Tikal in the years since , even though the two cities were a half-day 's walk apart . In the brief conversation they had had earlier , she had spoken of Balam Xoc with both skepticism and concern , as if her father 's recent notoriety had to be a symptom of imbalance or advancing age . " I asked Kinich what had come between the two of you , " she ventured now , " but he would not say . I think it is sad that you will not join in the celebration of his success . " " I celebrated with him in Yaxchilan , " Akbal told her , betraying a trace of wistfulness that seemed to offend him and made him harden his voice . " But I would not inflict my company upon him here . He is the favorite of the delegation , and walks at their head . I walk alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Porn Ix pointed out gently , " and he holds a much higher rank than you do . " " Of course , " Akbal said sourly . " But I was also praised by Shield Jaguar , and given the run of his city . And in Ektun , my sponsor was the high priest himself , Ah Kin Tzab . It is only among the ruler 's delegation that I am treated with disdain . We were barely out of sight of Ektun when I was ordered to the rear of the column , just ahead of the commoners . " Porn Ix paused judiciously before replying , as if to allow his bitterness to pass . " Perhaps the favor you won in Yaxchilan was itself a cause for resentment , " she suggested , and Akbal looked at her sharply , alert to the implications of her remark . He seemed about to defend himself , then changed his mind . " No doubt . I do not know what has been said about me , and I do not wish to learn . I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Porn Ix straightened up abruptly , her eyes bright with hurt and anger . " Are we not your people ? " she demanded sternly . " My husband 's family hasp142been affiliated with the Jaguar Paw Clan since the beginning of our cities , by friendship as well as by blood . " " I did not mean to insult you , my lady , " Akbal apologized . " But I have spoken to many members of your family , and you are the only one even to mention Balam Xoc to me . I heard more about him in Ektun . " The anger faded from Pom Ix 's eyes , and she let out a long breath , a gesture of tacit agreement . There was a new frankness in her voice when she spoke again . " I have known my father far longer than you , Akbal , but I can not make sense of what I hear about him lately . He was never a man to stir up trouble or draw attention to himself , never . Nor did he have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lived in his house . He was a supervisor of building projects , and contented with his work . It was only after my mother and brother died that Box Ek suggested it to him , as a way to divert him from his grief . Perhaps no one has ever told you these things , but they are true . " " It was grief for my mother , as well , " Akbal reminded her . " I can only tell you that he has changed ; he is no longer the man any of us knew . You must go to Tikal and see for yourself . " " I would like to , " Pom Ix confessed , then sighed and shrugged to show her misgivings . " I must tell you , though , that my husband and the other men here are not convinced of his wisdom . They know that the Jaguar Paw Clan has prospered because of what my father has done , but they do not believe that anyone can defy the ruler of Tikal with impunity . Not for long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Akbal demanded , " and ignore the visions they have sent him ? " Pom Ix gave him a searching glance but did not respond , and Akbal could feel her withdraw from him , seeing him as the young nephew she hardly knew , an impetuous youth whose opinion could not be weighed against that of her husband and the older men . He straightened his back and bowed to her stiffly . " You must return to your other guests , my lady . I am grateful for your concern , but perhaps you can understand now why it is better for me to remain here . " " Yes , " Porn Ix agreed reluctantly , and rose to her feet , gathering her skirt around her . " I will see you in the morning , before you leave , " she added , somewhat sadly , and disappeared through the curtain , again exposing him to the light and noise of his brother 's success . Akbal blew air through his nostrils and shivered violently , releasing the tight grip he had been keeping on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spoken to Porn Ix , but it had not been easy for him to speak to her at all . His pain was too close to the surface , a fresh , naked wound that throbbed at even the most sympathetic touch . He had come close , at every juncture in the conversation , to saying something worse . He looked around at his packs , patting the leather pouch that held his commissions and the trade agreements he had made with the other painters , trying to distract himself with the evidence of his success . But it was no use : He could not shut out the sounds of the celebration now , the dim laughter that drifted to his ears like an echo of his own humiliation . Two warriors  --  Kinich 's men  --  had come for him once the delegation was well out upon the trail , saying only that he was in the wrong place , before marching him and his porter back to the end of the line , past all the lifted eyebrows and sneering faces .. .  |p143Chan  Mac had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen his vase . And he had himself warned Zac Kuk , at the risk of losing her . Yet he had prepared himself for ingratitude , not outright contempt , and he had been taken by surprise by the fury of his own response , the burning sense of outrage that made him want to fight with the warriors instead of going quietly . It was the utter gratuitousness of the act that infuriated and consumed him . It was not enough for the ruler simply to disown his representative ; he had to be publicly scorned as well , and made to bear the blame for the ruler 's decisions . Akbal rose and snuffed out the torch on the wall , stumbling over one of his packs as he found his way back to his sleeping mat . He had little hope of sleeping tonight , with the anger and pain still churning so strongly inside him , and the noise of the celebration assaulting him from without . He lay down and closed his eyes anyway , trying to conjure up the image of his grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pain . TikalTHE TUN COUNT Priest Nohoch Ich hurried through the predawn darkness , followed closely by a young apprentice whose arms were filled with writing materials and ritual implements . Nohoch himself carried a ladle of smoking copal incense and a painted wooden staff  --  a sighting staff  --  to which a pair of crossed sticks had been tied , forming a V-shaped sight . His haste and the unevenness of the path put him in danger of spilling the incense from the shallow , curving ladle , but he could see the sky beginning to lighten ahead , and he dared not be late on a day as cloudy as this . The Sun might show himself for only an instant , or not at all , but Nohoch had to be sure he had seen everything he could . The viewing platform that belonged to the Tun Count Order lay to the east of the Tikal marketplace , on a flat , treeless ridge overlooking a narrow ravine . The plastered surface of the platform was still wet from last night 's rain , and the ravine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks in vaporous waves . Arriving out of breath , Nohoch saw that he was not as late as he had feared , and he took a few moments to recover while his assistant searched for a dry place to set down his books and implements . Beyond the ravine , the ground had been cleared down to low bush for a considerable distance , affordingan observer on the platform an unimpeded view of the low hills that formed the eastern horizon . In the center of the cleared space , some three hundred feet from the platform , a notched staff identical to the one Nohoch held had been planted upright in the ground , providing a permanent foresight for the observation of the Sun 's rising . When his breathing had returned to normal , Nohoch handed his own staff to his assistant and waved the smoking ladle over it , and then over himself and the young man , purifying all of them and consecrating them to their tasks . Then he faced east and bowed low , offering a prayer of welcome to Kin , the great fiery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Kin , whose very name was the word for " day . " The apprentice took a seat behind him and began to prepare his paints andp144brushes , and Nohoch held his sighting staff in both hands while he examined the shallow horizontal groove that ran from one end of the long platform to the other , functioning as the observer 's baseline . The painted mark of yesterday'ssighting was still visible despite the effects of the rain , and Nohoch planted his staff just to the right of the mark , only two fingers ' distance to the south . The Sun was approaching his time of standing still , when he would achieve his most northerly point of rising , and his position along the horizon changed only slightly from day to day . It was a delicate task to measure this change accurately , especially with the sky so cloudy , and Nohoch squinted with concentration as he peered through the V-shaped notch of his staff , sighting in on the staff in the distance . His eyes felt heavy and swollen , reminding him of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , forcing him to straighten up and clamp a hand over his mouth to prevent an unseemly sound from escaping his lips . Nohoch did not turn to look at the apprentice , but he knew that the young man could not have missed his display of weariness , and had no doubt been shocked by it . Nohoch was beyond being shocked at himself , and he did not bother to attempt a justification , using the energy it would have taken to make sure that he had not inadvertently moved his staff . Today I yawn , tomorrow I sleep , he thought numbly , certain that he could not hold off disgrace forever . He had not had a full night 's sleep in two months , since the day he and Balam Xoc had gone before the high priest . That was when the testing of his strength had truly begun , a test that had brought him to his present , enervated state , poised stubbornly on the brink of collapse . Stooping behind his staff , Nohoch repressed a sigh of despair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had become more distinctive with the growing of the light . In the first days after the revelation of Balam Xoc 's vision , when it had seemed that the attention of the whole city was focused upon the Jaguar Paw Clan , Nohoch had taken refuge in his priestly duties . He had found them a welcome respite from the demands being made upon him as the head of the clan council , tasks that could be accomplished in a quiet , orderly fashion , with predictable and verifiable results . He would return to the crowded chaos of the clan house feeling refreshed and renewed from a night spent beneath the stars , his sense of order restored by a successful calculation of their movements and influences . But then the harassment had begun , and he had found himself assigned to more than his usual share of late-night vigils and predawn risings , and to tasks that seemed designed to try his patience and use up his strength . Though none of his superiors would acknowledge it , they were clearly under pressure from the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the only way he could . Nohoch was outraged by this , and he had vowed that he would never complain or give in , no matter what was done to him . But the satisfaction he had always taken in his work as a priest was gone , destroyed as much by his resentment as by his fatigue . He could only go through the motions now , worn down to the point where his conduct had actually begun to deserve the scrutiny it received . " My lord ... ? " the apprentice prompted expectantly , and Nohoch hastily returned his attention to the task at hand , feeling a sickening surge of panic at the realization of how far his mind had wandered . He grasped the staffp145tightly in both hands , struggling to calm the fearful beating of his heart as he funneled his gaze into the invisible line connecting the two sights . Shifting his stance by degrees , he gradually brought both sights into conjunction , centering on the orange crescent that had just appeared above the distant hills , a bright sliver of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , 0 Kin , he prayed desperately . Show me your face , Great Spirit , show me that I have not offended you with my weariness and negligence . The crescent wavered and disappeared for a moment , crossed by a scudding cloud . Then a broad shaft of yellow light suddenly broke over the crest of the hills , dazzling Nohoch 's eyes in momentary defiance of the clouds . His heart lifted , and he nearly cried out in gratitude , refraining only out of fear that he would dislodge his sighting staff . Then the Sun was gone , hidden by the clouds , though not before Nohoch had noted the precise points at which the crescent had intersected with the horizon . " Mark , " he commanded confidently , and the apprentice knelt beside him and carefully painted a circular mark around the bottom of his sighting staff . Nohoch lifted the staff and held it high over his head in a prolonged , heartfelt salute to the Sun . Then he sat with the apprentice and showed him where to paint in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , which had been prepared beforehand . When this had been done , Nohoch took the brush from the young man and painted in the proper glyphs indicating the date , the age of the Moon , and the count within the lunar calendar . He did this meticulously , without haste , experiencing a deep sense of finality and completion . " In another thirteen days , Kin will reach his place of rest , " he announced when he was through . " Then he will begin his journey back into the southern half of the sky . " The apprentice nodded respectfully , then tilted his head to the right , making a covert gesture toward the southern end of the platform . " I did not wish to disturb you before , my lord , " he said softly . " But that old man has been watching us for some time . " Nohoch 's first thought was that someone had been sent to spy on him , and he turned to look with a mixture of anger and trepidation , wondering if his yawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the platform was Balam Xoc . " Grandfather , " Nohoch said in surprise and relief , rising to his feet and gesturing for Balam Xoc to join him . " That should be dry enough by now , " he said to the apprentice . " You may leave me now . " The young man collected his materials and left the platform , bowing politely to Balam Xoc as he passed . Nohoch also bowed , even though Balam Xoc gestured that it was not necessary . " I woke thinking of you , and could not return to sleep , " the old man said in greeting . " Perhaps it is time we spoke . " Nohoch sighed audibly and let his shoulders slump . He knew that he should be more astonished than he was , but all he could feel was relieved and comforted , as if someone had found him alone in the dark and cold and had quietly put a blanket over his shoulders . It was Balam Xoc 's presence that made him feel this , however ; his eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen my fatigue , then ? " he suggested quietly , and the eyesp146flickered up to his face , no doubt seeing the lines of strain and the dark circles that Nohoch knew surrounded his own eyes . " I have seen the unnecessary hardships to which you have been subjected , " Balam Xoc replied . " I have wondered why you did not lodge a protest on your own behalf , since you clearly do not deserve such punishment . " " It is the high priest 's doing , " Nohoch explained , spreading his hands wide in a helpless gesture . Balam Xoc 's face , which had displayed little sympathy to begin with , hardened perceptibly . " Of course it is . But Ah Kin Cuy is from the Order of Katun Priests . Who is he to interfere with your duties ? The katun priests are little more than self-important soothsayers , and I know that the Tun Count priests share my disdain for them . " Nohoch was speechless with surprise , until he remembered all the people who came to sit with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others obviously willing to share their deepest secrets with the Living Ancestor . " The katun priests are still very powerful , " he managed finally . " It would be unwise for us to venture such an opinion openly , and risk antagonizing them . " " Yet you would allow them to antagonize you ? Dignity does not always reside in silence , Nohoch . Your anger must tell you this . " Nohoch did not ask how Balam Xoc knew of his anger , assuming that it must be as apparent to him as his fatigue . Was there anything that was not apparent to him ? " What would you suggest I do , Grandfather ? " he asked humbly . " Defend yourself . You have the right to expect your superiors to protect you from such harassment . " " Yes , " Nohoch agreed ruefully . " But I do not expect them to defy the high priest on my account . " " Then you must request a reduction in your duties , " Balam Xoc told him bluntly , " or accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nohoch sighed again , and looked at his feet . " Such a request would entail a loss of rank , " he said in a plaintive voice . " And a surrender of the revenues that feed my family . " " Has your rank protected you ? " Balam Xoc demanded . " You are being treated like the lowliest of apprentices , yet you cling to your rank as if it will save you . As for the other , you know as well as I that the clan can easily make up the difference , and would be honored to do so . Your own people , at least , have not forgotten your worth . " " I will have to consider  --  " Nohoch began , but Balam Xoc cut him off impatiently . " You were fortunate today , Nohoch . Kin smiled upon you , despite your weariness and inattention . Was this not a sign , a message to you ? Will you wait for disgrace to overtake you , or will you free yourself now , while your heart and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do you pressure me , Grandfather ? " Nohoch protested . " These are not matters to be decided in haste . " " You have equivocated long enough , " Balam Xoc assured him drily . " Now you must choose . You can not he what you were , Nohoch ; the priesthood is no longer a sanctuary for you , a place where you can hide behind hooks andp147numbers . You must take back your life , or leave it to those who do not respect its value . " Nohoch looked down at the painted staff in his hands , then away toward the distant hills , which were lit from behind by an orange glow . " Must I resign from my order ? " he asked finally , meeting the old man 's insistent gaze . Balam Xoc shook his head in denial . " By no means . I have no quarrel with the Tun Count priests , nor they with me . The keeping of time has been a sacred task since our beginnings as a people , and I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon your knowledge , Nohoch , and follow after me like a pilgrim . I expect you only to change , as you must , to meet the needs of our people . " " I will speak to the head of my order , then , " Nohoch murmured wearily . " I can not pretend that I am not tired and angry , and close to the end of my usefulness as a priest . As you say , it is better that I remove myself now , before I am driven out completely . " " I will leave you to your farewells , then , " Balam Xoc said succinctly , and turned away without another word . Nohoch watched him go in silence , too drained to know if the lightness in his limbs was due to relief or incipient regret . Not bothering to find a dry spot , he sat down on the platform and balanced his staff across his knees , and stared for a long time at the hidden face of the Sun . THE AIR was warm and thick with humidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to fall before the Tikal delegation was put in order and led out of Uaxactun . The honor guard of warriors , in full-feathered battle dress , were at the front of the column , with Kinich Kakmoo prominent among them , wearing the clipped headdress of scarlet macaw feathers and the knotted chest protector that Shield Jaguar had given him . Behind the warriors came the heads of the delegation and their wives , their necks and arms encircled by strings and bracelets of jade and polished shell , their elegant heads wrapped with lengths of extravagantly colored cloth . Some were accompanied by servantsholding palm-leaf umbrellas , while the most important among them were carried in cloth-covered litters . The rest of the delegation followed in an order determined by rank and function , the priests forming a somber group between the high-ranking diplomatsand the merchant chiefs , the latter recognizable by their black staves and articles of foreign dress . Akbal was the very last of those of noble blood . His position was not really so different from the one he had occupied on the journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his companions then  --  maintained a careful distance from him and his porter , making clear their unwillingness to have him in their midst . The Tikal Painter walks alone , Akbal thought , experiencing a surge of residual bitterness . His eyes felt hollow and wild after a night without sleep , yet there was an energy flowing frantically just beneath his skin , a nervous pulsation that made his hands tremble and sweat . Out of impulses he had not paused to identify , he had dressed himself in the same loincloth and net headwrap he had worn during his interview with Shield Jaguar , yet he had also put on his headband , tumpline , and pack . After considerable coaxing , he hadp148pried enough bundles loose from his porter 's load to fill the pack , justifying what was essentially a gesture of contempt , a deliberate and spiteful withholdingof his nobility , and thus his respect . The porter clearly thought that he had taken leave of his senses , and in his present state , Akbal had little inclination to correct the man 's impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since he had been made to bear so much . After passing through the outskirts of Uaxactun , the trail narrowed and plunged into the shadowy depths of the forest that provided the city with its timber and firewood . The smell of wet earth and rotting vegetation was very strong , and lingering sheets of fog broke and disintegrated before the marching figures . Though the rain could barely penetrate the leafy canopy overhead , the trail was predictably soft in this season , and was quickly churned into mud by the heavy tread of the warriors and litter bearers ahead . Akbal and his porter clung to the grassy edges of the path , risking the danger of snakes for the sake of some solid ground that did not suck at their bare feet and make the loads upon their backs even heavier . Woodcutters stopped their work to watch the procession pass , standing conspicuously in clearings of their own creation , dwarfed by the great cedar or mahogany they had felled . Then the long , straggling line came out into the open again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wilting the once-stiff cone of his headwrap . Maize fields spread out on both sides of the trail , the rich , reddish soil half-hidden beneath a layer of cinders , the young stalks of maize thrusting up in long rows , seeming extraordinarily green against the background of blackened soil and charred stumps . Akbal could not tell if these fields belonged to Uaxactun or Tikal , but they had obviously profited from a good early season . He realized that he had given no thought to this season 's crops , having been away during the time he would ordinarily have been listening to his father 's worries and complaints about seed deficits , insect infestations , and the perennial shortage of workmen . It was startling to come upon all this new growth without the seasonal warning of his father 's anxiety . The fields gave way to low , swampy ground , then to another stretch of forest , the delegation alternately stringing out and bunching up as those in the lead periodically paused to change litter bearers or negotiate a particularly treacherous piece of the trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed Tikal 's northern border appeared ahead , standing out from the surroundingforest by virtue of the deep moats that flanked the wall on both sides . Erected during the troubled times of the last Katun ii Ahau , thirteen katuns in the past , the earthworks were greatly eroded , held together by the tenaciouslytangled roots of the trees that grew along the top . Still , they were an impressive sight , rising twenty feet high and extending in both directions for as far as the eye could see , a standing testament to an external threat long since forgotten . Shortly after passing through the gap in the earthworks , the procession stalled again , then stopped altogether for reasons that no one bothered to explain to the muddy marchers in the rear . Akbal lowered his pack onto a flat rock beside the trail and eased the band of his tumpline off over his headwrap , rubbing at the indentations in his forehead . Clusters of thatched-roof houses were visible among the ubiquitous stands of breadnut trees , and gradually people began to come out along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were mostly women and children , and very poor , judging by the worn drabness of their clothing . They stared at the members of the delegation as if they had never seen such fantastic beings before , bowing automatically whenever any of the lords deigned to glance in their direction . For his part , Akbal could not help but stare back at them , stricken by the sight of the bony , underfed bodies of the children , and by the glazed , listless expressions on the faces of their mothers . Many of the younger children , especially those just beyond the age of weaning , cried continuously , raising a noise that contrasted eerily with the stolid silence of the women . Resisting the urge to cover his ears , he watched as a tiny , naked boy squatted in the weeds beside the trail , emitting a high , piercing whine along with a sputtering stream of liquid excrement . These are the people who have borne the weight of Katun ii Ahau most heavily , Akbal realized , tearing his eyes away when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bad crops of the past three seasons had no doubt left them to subsist on breadnuts and the produce from their tiny garden plots , which were wedged in around and between the houses , wherever the ground was high enough . And even though it was their husbands and fathers who tended the fields outside the earthworks , Akbal knew that they were likely to see little of the maize and beans they harvested for the ruler . The needs of the city would have to be met first , and the seed deficits made up , before anything would be distributed to them . Akbal had often heard his father complain of the difficulty of accomplishing these basically contradictory tasks , especially with maize in high demand as a trade item . He could not recall , though , ever hearing his father mention these people , or worry over their needs . What I have to bear is very little , he thought humbly as he shouldered his pack and rejoined the march . The little boy 's whine seemed to have lodged inside his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With a delayed jolt of recognition , he realized that he had seen faces like theirs before , and quite recently . The captives on the monuments of Yaxchilan and Ektun had worn the same abject , defeated expressions , the look of those who endure without hope . Yet these were captives who had been taken without a fight , and their subjugation had gone unrecorded , except in the misery written upon their faces . Akbal did not wonder , as the wails of the children receded behind him , that it had been the poor people of the clan who had responded most powerfullyto Balam Xoc 's defiant message . The clustered houses within sight of the trail grew larger and more elaborate as the procession continued south , and the people who came out to greet them were better dressed and less solemn in their curiosity . They called to members of the delegation by name , and several times the cry of " Kinich Kakmoo ! " drifted back to Akbal 's ears , followed by the sounds of cheering and applause . Young boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widened and became firm underfoot , the earth covered by a hard-packed layer of limestone marl . Akbal was suddenly aware of the reddish mud caked onto his legs and feet , soil that was not being washed away by the misty rain , which had finally succeeded in flattening his headwrap against the back of his head . He made no attempts to improve his appearance , though , during the long wait that ensued once the column had reached the northern ceremonial centerp150of the city . The vanity had been shocked out of him , and he had fallen into an obsessively observant state , taking new impressions of the Tikal that had been so familiar for so long . The complex of temples and palaces that surroundedhim where he stood had been built during the long reign of the previous ruler , Cauac Caan , and its centerpiece was the Katun Enclosure that had been erected in honor of the sixteenth katun of the cycle , Katun 2 Ahau . Like all the other Katun Enclosures in the city , its layout mirrored that of the Plaza of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western ends of the broad plaza , a nine-doorwayed building to the south , and an ancestral shrine  --  here only a small rectangular structure  --  to the north . Yet unlike the Great Plaza , which had been continually rebuilt during Tikal 's long history , this Enclosure had been abandoned after its twenty-tun period had expired . The white paint on the pyramids had chipped and faded , exposing the yellow stone beneath , and grass had grown up between the stones that floored the plaza . Akbal thought again of Yaxchilan and Ektun , where the ceremonial center had been relocated several times , leaving sections of both cities looking nearly as desolate as the Katun Enclosure before him . It is a foreign practice , he decided , recalling that his grandfather had said the same of the katun rites themselves . The leaders of the delegation had returned from the Sky Clan temple , where they had made an offering , and when the march was resumed , Akbal found that the entire procession was visible ahead of him , moving down the long , straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plaza of the Ancestors . The causeway was thirty feet wide and was flanked on both sides by waist-high parapets , its plastered surface raised well above the swampy ground over which it passed . It descended southward on a gradual decline , angling slightly westward at its midpoint . Off to his right , at a distance from the causeway , Akbal could see the twin pyramids of the Katun Enclosure dedicated by Cacao Moon to the fifteenth katun , Katun 4 Ahau . It had also been abandoned after use , and was in an even more advanced state of ruin than its successor to the north . It was soon obscured from Akbal 's view by a group of large buildings that stood between it and the causeway , and he turned his attention to the left , where an immense stairway led down to the Katun Enclosure currently under construction . He had heard his father complaining for some time that the Enclosure was behind schedule , and he could see at a glance that this was true . Both pyramids were still in the early stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone , and the nine-doorwayed building to the south was lacking its vaulted roof . Only the rectangular structure to the north , where the ruler 's monument would stand , had been completed , though Akbal knew that the monument itself had yet to be carved . Gangs of workmen labored on both pyramids , ignoring the rain , but they seemed too few to possibly complete the task in time . With the end of Katun ii Ahau less than four tuns away , the ruler would have to commit a great many more men to this project  --  and soon  --  if he hoped to fulfill his vow to Buluc Ahau . The procession had halted again , met at its head by a greeting party of dignitaries . But Akbal was too involved in his own discoveries to pay any heed to the speeches being exchanged ahead . fie had looked beyond the constructionsite to the Katun Enclosure presently in use , which had been dedicatedp151by Caan Ac only sixteen tuns before . Its twin pyramids were immense , perhaps twice as large as any of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they , too , would be abandoned upon completion of the new Enclosure , which had obviously been conceived on the same enormous scale . Akbal swept his eyes back to the right , and the three aligned Katun Enclosures  --  oneabandoned , one in the process of being built , one soon to be abandoned  --  suddenly coalesced into a single image of vanity and waste . He understood all at once , in a way that words alone could never have taught him , the truth of his grandfather 's contention : that the observance of the katun rites was leading Tikal to its ruin . Caan Ac had no choice but to finish the next Enclosure , no matter what it cost , no matter where else the workmen might be needed . To do otherwise would be to abandon the responsibility he had assumed for the success of the crops , which was the basis for his claim to power . So the construction would go forward , and the rites to insure fertility would be performed , even at the expense of the preparation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a gamble that substituted prayer for prudence , putting both the ruler and the people  --  his captives  --  completely at the mercy of the spirit of the katun . Can we trust our fate to the whims of Buluc Ahau , Akbal wondered , turning his eyes ahead as the procession again began to move , carrying him away from the Katun Enclosures . But he knew the answer to his own question ; he had seen it in the faces of the poor , and heard it in the weanling 's whine of pain and hunger . Is the ruler more powerful than his prophecy ? he thought , recalling a question he had heard attributed to his grandfather . It seemed to him now to be a question that contained its own answer . The crowd accompanying the column down the causeway had grown considerablyin both size and enthusiasm , and more people were waiting in the East Plaza , many of them foreign merchants who had strolled over from the marketplace , drawn by the noise and festive behavior of the crowd . Akbal was offended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears to it , withdrawing once more into himself . The celebrants and curiosity seekers fell away as the delegationleft the East Plaza and descended the stairs in the direction of the Plaza of the Ancestors . Now their path was lined by priests and dignitaries , who escorted them in silence onto the plastered flagstones of the plaza itself . Akbal experienced a familiar pressure upon his skin , a distinct heaviness in the atmosphere that had nothing to do with the rain . He had always felt he was being watched here , even to his innermost thoughts and feelings , and he identified the source of this sensation as the deep , abiding presence of the ancestors , those who had recognized the power and holiness of this place and had built their temples around it . And had continued to build their temples around it , Akbal thought , taking a fiercely proprietary pride in the fact that grass would never be allowed to grow in this plaza . Surrounded by a second honor guard of warriors , the members of the delegation were arrayed in even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which stood on the east side of the plaza . The towering pyramid rose in nine steep levels to the squat , single-doored shrine at the top , which was surmounted in turn by an ornate , two-story roof comb bearing the seated figure of the late ruler . There were two uncarved monuments at the base of the temple stairs , and Caan Ac stood upon the stone pedestal in front of the northernp152monument , wearing a jaguar-skin kilt and a feathered headdress so tall it was held upright by a frame attached to his back . The feathers were wilting in the rain , and the ruler 's wet tunic clung to the contours of his stomach , emphasizinghis girth . Akbal thought that he looked absurd rather than magnificent , but he was still too affected by where he was to allow himself to entertain disrespectful thoughts . After the delegation had bowed to the ruler and had received the blessing of the high priest , Caan Ac delivered a lengthy speech of greeting , praising them as a group and welcoming them back to their city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . " Kinich Kakmoo Balam , come forward , " he commanded in his highpitched voice . " From this day forth , you shall bear the title of nacom , warchief of Tikal . " The front ranks of the delegation parted slightly , and Kinich stepped out of their midst to stand proudly before the ruler , the scarlet feathers of his headdress waving soddenly above his head . One of the other nacoms attached a train of precious blue-green quetzal feathers to the warrior 's broad back , and a second warchief presented him with a long ceremonial spear bearing a leaf-shaped point of greyish-pink flint . Then the ruler invited him to stand upon the pedestal next to his own , and the assembled crowd expressed their approval with a low , concerted murmuring . You have rewarded the right brother , Akbal thought , feeling a surge of his earlier resentment . He scanned the lines of dignitaries on both sides of the pedestals , picking out his father and his father 's assistant , Chac Mut , the high priest of the clan , Tzec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paw leaders . Perhaps there were others from the clan who were hidden from his gaze , but if so , he was just as glad he did not have to see them . He took solace in the fact that at least Balam Xoc had not chosen to attend , a solace no less comforting for being predictable . As the ruler began to call forward the individual members of the delegation to convey his thanks , Akbal 's resentment cooled and hardened , taking the form of a bitter expectancy . You are a coward , Caan Ac , he thought coldly , as the ranking delegates left their places to receive the ruler 's personal greetings . Among them was Kuch Caan , the Tikal diplomat who had been courting Zac Kuk , which allowed Akbal a brief , gloating moment of scorn as he stood in the rain , waiting to be passed over . After the lords had returned to their places , Caan Ac recognized the lesser members of the group according to the functions they had performed , singling out the heads of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the collective contributions of their men . The painters , however , received no mention at all , as if even a passing reference might give rise to unpleasant associations . You are a coward , Caan Ac , Akbal repeated to himself , and I will never serve you again . When Caan Ac had finally finished speaking , the feast in honor of Kinich Kakmoo was announced , and the ruler led his new nacom off in the midst of an eager crowd of Tikal lords . The commoners and those without the rank to merit an invitation to the feast slowly began to disperse , and Akhal turned to his bearer , who had already begun to struggle into his tumplinc . Akhal started to assist him , then saw his father approaching through the thinning crowd andp153told the man to put down his pack and wait . He went forward with great ambivalence , almost wishing that his father had not stayed behind to speak to him . " Welcome home , my son , " Pacal said quietly , and Akbal examined his father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own face was coming more and more to look the same . His father 's eyes , though , were those of a steward rather than an artist , and they gave back nothing more than they were meant to . Akbal bowed , annoyed by the lack of emotion displayed there , as if this were a homecoming like any other . He held the bow for an extra moment , trying to allow his annoyance to pass . " You have gained weight , " Pacal added awkwardly , when it became clear that Akbal was not going to reply to his greeting . " I was well fed in Yaxchilan and Ektun . And well treated . " Pacal glanced past him , as if to be sure the bearer was out of earshot , then stepped closer and laid his hands on Akbal 's shoulders . " I want you to know , my son , that I am grateful to you , and proud of the way you performed in Yaxchilan . You have done our city a great service . Someday , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for the ruler to say this to you himself . " " Perhaps you do not need to , " Akbal said curtly , stiffening in his father 's grasp . " Perhaps I understand all too well . " Pacal let his hands drop from Akbal 's shoulders and stood back to study his son 's face . His expression was one of concern , but Akbal could see a weighing of strategies in the flickering of his eyes . " You have a right to be angry with me , " he confessed finally , lowering his eyes and his voice . " It was I who involved you in this , as a favor to the ruler . I can only promise that I will never allow you to be used in such a manner again . " " You will not allow ! " Akbal blurted in outraged disbelief , then bit his lip before anything more rude could escape his tongue . He turned to stare at the clan temples massed upon the northern platform , breathing deeply as he struggled for control . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been lost upon his father , whose face was tense and uncertain . " You owe me no apologies , Father , " Akbal said tightly . " I did not suffer in my time away from here . I became the Tikal Painter , and I made many friends for myself and my clan . I even found the woman I intend to marry . I do not think of myself as a man who has been used , despite the ruler 's ingratitude . That is only a reflection upon him . " " You have matured greatly , " Pacal allowed , choosing to overlook the bitternessin his son 's voice . " We must speak later about this woman . " " It is the custom . " The indifference of Akbal 's reply was deliberate and cruel , but his father heard him impassively , nodding once as he glanced around the plaza , which was nearly deserted . " I am expected at the ruler 's feast . Your grandfather is holding a feast in your honor at his house . I believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greet you . " Akhal 's eyebrows lifted in surprise , freeing a drop of water that ran unnoticeddown the long bridge of his nose.  | " Were they not invited to the feast for Kinich ? " " I invited them all myself . But your grandfather has convinced the majority that the Tikal Painter is more worthy of their respect . " " But he could not convince you , " Akbal said in a flat voice , making it a statement rather than a question . " Perhaps you did not truly mean the things you said to me earlier . " " Do not taunt me , Akbal ! " Pacal flared angrily . " My position is more complicated than you know , or than your grandfather is willing to believe . " " I can see that , " Akbal retorted . " It can not be easy to serve a man who is loyal only to himself . " As Pacal 's eyes narrowed , and he opened his mouth to speak , Akbal straightened his shoulders , expecting to be reprimanded for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then his father thought better of it and terminated the conversation with an abrupt bow . Turning away , he gestured for his assistant , Chac Mut , to join him and started off across the plaza , following in the path the ruler and Kinich Kakmoo had taken earlier . Akbal watched him go in silence , disappointed that his father did not have the courage to separate himself from the ruler , or to demand his son 's respect . He knew then that his own path would take him in another direction , and ever farther from his father 's approval . To become a man , he thought ruefully , gazing at the great temples that surrounded the plaza , perhaps even a man of Tikal . KANAN NAAB had recognized the change in her brother at first glance , as surely as she would had his hair turned white or his complexion darkened . It showed in the way he responded to the people who came out of the craft house to greet him as he came up the trail with his porter behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with mud and disheveled by the rain , his headwrap fallen around his ears and his face tautly distorted beneath the band of his tumpline . It was a situation that might have embarrassed anyone , and Kanan Naab knew her brother to be only slightly more at ease with people than she was herself . Yet Akbal had smiled at them with complete self-possession , striding up to bow before Cab Coh and take the old man 's extended hand . Then he had allowed his gaze to fall over all of them , without staring at any one among them , and had spoken in a clear , quiet voice : " Greetings , my people . It is a great pleasure to be among you again . " Kanan Naab had been as touched by his obvious sincerity as were the others , and had not minded that his personal greeting to her was gracious but brief , cut off by the press of all those who wanted Akbal 's attention . She had stayed as close to him as possible as the group began to move toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted the compliments being showered upon him . He was not unfamiliar with praise , she had noted , and did not shy away from the title of Tikal Painter . His speech had also become more polished , and he had picked up some gestures that were new to her and seemed slightly extravagant in their courtliness . My brother has learned how to present himself , she had decided , though she remained uncertain as to the depth and significance of this change.  |p155Then  Akbal had gone off to his room to dispose of his packs and change into dry clothing , and Kanan Naab had been forced to go back to her duties . So many people had decided to attend Balam Xoc 's feast that the houses of Cab Coh and Nohoch Ich had also been pressed into service , and mats were being laid down in the craft house to accommodate the additional guests . Kanan Naab had taken many of the preparations upon herself , and she scurried from one cookhouse to the next , sending servants for more food and trying to put everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new prosperity of the clan , and make all those who came to the feast glad that they had chosen to honor him . Akbal himself was to meet privately with Balam Xoc and the members of the clan council before the feast began , and as soon as she could free herself , Kanan Naab went quietly to the back entrance of her grandfather'shouse . There was no one in the darkened back room , and she moved quickly across the floor , toward the voices on the other side of the curtained inner doorway . Only when she had reached the curtain did she stop to reflect on the propriety of what she was doing , and she turned instinctively to leave . But the sound of her brother 's voice drew her back , and when she looked through the crack between the curtain and the doorframe and saw him sitting next to Balam Xoc and Cab Coh , all thoughts of leaving vanished . Though she could not see them , she sensed that the part of the room that was beyond the range of her vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the wall behind the place where Akbal sat . He had a bundle of painted sticks open on the floor in front of him , and he gestured toward it with one arm , his other arm clamped securely over the leather pouch at his side . Kanan Naab 's ears pricked up at the word Zuyhua , but otherwise she had come in at the end of the conversation , and could not make sense of what Akbal was saying . The men in the room seemed to find it significant , however , and murmured deeply when he was through . " And what is in your pouch , my son ? " Balam Xoc asked when the room was again silent . " It must be very precious , since you hold it so closely to your heart . " " I made friends in these cities , " Akbal said with visible pride . He removed a handful of rolled deerhide sheets from the pouch and passed them across to Cab Coh . " These are trade agreements I have made with men I know in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the river . They require only your consent , Grandfather , to be made final . " Cab Coh unrolled one of the documents and scanned it briefly , squinting his watery eyes to make out the glyphs and the columns of bars and dots representingamounts . Grunting softly , as if favorably impressed , he handed the limp leather sheet to Balam Xoc . " I will examine them more carefully later , " Cab Coh said . " But the terms appear quite fair . How were you able to obtain them ? " " These are the men who painted with me in Yaxchilan , as I told you earlier , " Akbal explained , reaching into the pouch and producing another sheaf of the flattened leather rolls . He kept one aside for himself and placed the rest in a small pile in front of Cab Coh . " I have also accepted a number of commissions of my own . I think you will find that the payment is sufficient to more than compensate for my time . "  |p156As  Cab Coh opened the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had draped the first document over his knee without looking at it . His eyes were gleaming , and he looked as if he wanted to laugh . He poked mischievouslyat the sheet in Cab Coh 's hands . " Well , my brother , " he demanded in a teasing voice , " does your assistant know how to barter for his services ? " " Can this be true , Akbal ? " Cab Coh inquired , blinking in bewilderment . " I know this man , and I would not have suspected that he was capable of bartering so poorly on his own behalf . " " He bartered more shrewdly than some others , " Akbal said with a trace of annoyance . " Those are the kinds of fees my work commands in Ektun . The same fees the Sky Clan merchants have been obtaining for some time , " he added pointedly . " I think it is time we had a new accounting with them . " Cab Coh was rendered speechless by the suggestion , but Balam Xoc broke in sharply , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sky Clan has been cheating us ? " " There is the proof , " Akbal replied , gesturing toward the stack of commissions . " Even with the cost of hiring our own porters , our profits would be greater than they are now . " Balam Xoc sat back and looked expectantly at his brother , who was still recovering from his shock . The document in Cab Coh 's hands began to shake , and his face slowly darkened with anger . " I will speak to the merchants tomorrow , " he vowed in a seething voice , displaying a fury so palpable , and so uncharacteristic , that Akbal and the men behind him recoiled in surprise . Even at a distance , concealed behind the curtain , Kanan Naab could feel the force of his anger . Balam Xoc , however , appeared delighted at seeing his mild-mannered brother so riled , and he extendeda hand toward the roll still in Akbal 's lap . " You have yet another surprise for us ? " he inquired knowingly , and Akbal cradled the roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kanan Naab 's mind that this was truly the document he had carried next to his heart . " I must present this to my father , " he said softly , frowning unconsciously , to himself . But then he looked around at the other men and smiled the same smile he had displayed outside the craft house . " It is a message from the Lord Batz Mac , of the Turtleshell Clan of Ektun . It concerns the matter of my marriage to his daughter , Zac Kuk . " Kanan Naab clapped a hand over her mouth to stifle an exclamation of surprise , but it would have been lost in the outburst of congratulations from the men anyway . " Who is this woman 's mother ? " a voice near at hand demanded , and Akbal laughed aloud , as if amused by the question . " She is the Lady Muan Kal . Of the Moon Clan . " " They are closely allied with the Sky Clan , " Cab Coh pointed out quietly , looking to Balam Xoc with concern . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Zac Kuk knows that it is the Jaguar Paw Clan to which she comes , " Akbal assured them firmly . " She knows how much it means to me that I am the grandson of the Living Ancestor . " Akbal 's voice had grown husky as he spoke , and he suddenly bowed top157Balam Xoc , crossing both arms over his chest and almost touching his foreheadto the floor . Kanan Naab drew a long , tremulous breath , intensely moved by her brother 's gesture . He has joined us , she thought ; he has accepted grandfather 's visions as his own , though he was not even here to hear of it . All of the changes she had perceived earlier , so startling in themselves , no longer seemed mysterious to her . He had become a Jaguar Paw , in spirit as well as blood . " You are old enough to take a wife , " Balam Xoc said simply , accepting the bow without comment . " And the wealth you have brought to the clan should help to raise a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , my brother ? " " Indeed , " Cab Coh said agreeably . " Perhaps it will even keep him here long enough to make me believe I have an assistant . " The men laughed loudly and began to call for balche , and Kanan Naab chose the moment to make her escape , heading quickly for the back door . I must tell Box Ek , she thought eagerly , then realized that she would have to explain how she had come by her knowledge . She hesitated briefly , then smiled to herself and went on toward Box Ek 's room . In return for news of Akbal 's marriage , she was certain , Box Ek would find a way to forgive her for her spying . AKBAL WAS at first too preoccupied with being the guest of honor , and too happy to be among his own people , to notice that they were not all his people . But gradually , as he went from his grandfather 's house to that of Cab Coh , and then to that of Nohoch Ich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced began to make a distinct impression upon him . Some were clan relations from distant parts of Tikal : cousins , uncles , and in-laws with whom he had never had the chance to meet . But there were many others who belonged to different clans altogether , including some from cities as far away as Pusilha and Copan . Akbal found himself becoming self-conscious in his storytelling , reluctant to speak of " foreign " ways in front of those who might be considered foreigners themselves . It soon became apparent , though , that none of these newcomers acted like strangers . Nor were they regarded as such by the other members of Akbal 's family , who often referred to their places of origin only as an afterthought . They were not at all reticent in approaching Akbal or questioning him about his experiences , seeming quite familiar with his background and accomplishments . How long have I been gone ? Akbal wondered , beginning to feel that he was the true stranger here . " The Jaguar Paw House has attracted many guests , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention of the rest of the companyhad been diverted by the appearance of servants bearing bowls of fruit . Nohoch took a slice of pineapple from the bowl offered to him and looked around the circle of faces for a moment , as if trying to see them through Akbal 's eyes . " ' I'hcy are not guests , " he replied finally , giving Akbal a significant glance . " They are followers . " " Ah , " Akhal murmured thoughtfully . he returned the priest 's gaze , trying to weigh the meaning the tcrm had for him . He had received part of hisp158education in the glyphs from Nohoch , and had always called him Uncle , but little in the way of intimacy had ever existed between them . This was partially due to Pacal 's open dislike for his cousin , though Akbal himself had always felt that Nohoch was rather aloof and remote , a priest in every way . " Much has changed while you were away , " Nohoch added . " No doubt you have heard of your grandfather 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told in Ektun . I was also told that he was called before the high priest , and that he claimed to have been given a vision . " " I was there when he revealed this to Ah Kin Cuy , " Nohoch averred . " It was an old woman , a Spirit Woman , who came to him in his confinement . She told him that he must be a compelling example to the young , and show them the power that lies in the old ways . " Akbal 's eyes widened in recognition . " He has already been that to me . The longer I was away , the more I felt his influence . " " That was clear in your presentation to the council , " Nohoch told him . " You were most impressive , Akbal . There was no one who did not think he had chosen to honor the right brother , after hearing of your accomplish-ments . " Akbal nodded mutely , warmed by the older man 's praise and encouraged by his frankness . " Are you also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite tone , and Nohoch stared at him for a moment before answering . " My vows would not permit such a thing . Nor does your grandfather wish me to follow him like a pilgrim . I do not think that he desires our devotion , Akbal ; only that we change , and take back our lives from the ruler . " " The ruler has made that easy for some of us , " Akbal said with a trace of residual bitterness . Then he gave Nohoch a swift , questioning glance . " In Uaxactun , though , there are many who doubt the wisdom of challenging the ruler 's power . " " They are here , too , " Nohoch admitted . " Not all changes are pleasant , or easy to accept . Yet on the whole , the clan has prospered . You are not the only one to bring us trade agreements : many of our guests ' also do so , and they bring us gifts and offerings as well . " Akbal cocked his head curiously , hearing the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like my father 's , he thought in wonder , recalling all the times he had heard his father deride Nohoch 's competence in this area . Yet Nohoch 's eyes met Akbal 's steadily , with none of the calculation of a royal steward . " I saw my father in the plaza today , " Akbal said impulsively , then paused before adding , " along with your son , Chac Mut . They followed the ruler to my brother 's feast . " " It is Chac Mut 's duty to obey your father . And your father 's to obey the ruler . " " I can not respect him for that any longer , " Akbal blurted . " He is the servant of our enemy . " " That is a harsh judgment , " Nohoch said gently . " I would hope to be regarded with more compassion by my own son . " Akbal swallowed thickly and shrugged , though not with indifference.  | " As you said , Uncle , not all changes are pleasant . " Nohoch nodded ruefully and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Akbal 's feelings . He took a sip of cacao from the cup in front of him and glanced around the room , remembering his duties as host . Then he looked back at Akbal and spoke in a more casual tone : " The drawings you made in Yaxchilan are most interesting . We must discussthem some time . " " I was not aware that so many people had seen them , " Akbal said in a bemused tone . " I do not even know who unpacked and aired them for me . " Nohoch smiled thinly . " It was your sister . She has been to see me about them several times , asking questions I could not answer . She does the same with your grandfather and the young priest from the Serpent Clan , Yaxal Can . Have you met him yet ? " " He also asked me about the drawings . He seems rather stiff and solemn , " Akbal added , then smiled self-deprecatingly . " But perhaps that is how all suitors seem . " " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a novice within the Tun Count Order and is very earnest about his work . Very ambitious , since it does not come easily to him . He was clearly disappointed when I told him that I had requested a reduction in my duties for the order , and had accepted a loss of rank . " " I see , " Akbal said shrewdly . " Do you think that this will affect his interest in Kanan Naab ? " " His interest is tested often enough already , " Nohoch assured him with a laugh . " Your sister is no longer a woman that any of us can choose to ignore . Her curiosity has become ferocious , and your grandfather indulges her completely . Yaxal has a hard time of it , for he is not a follower , either . " " Perhaps she will change him , " Akbal suggested , and Nohoch laughed again . He shook his head wryly , as if laughing at himself as well . " No doubt she will , " he said succinctly , spreading his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the custom , now ... " BALAM xoc stood among the breadnut trees behind his house , relieving himself of all the balche and cacao he had consumed during the feast . The leaves overhead rustled softly in the breeze that had finally carried off the rain , and a brilliant half-moon split the shadows with shafts of bright bluish light . From behind him he could hear the sounds of the servants cleaning up in the cookhouse : sounds of water being dumped and bowls scraped , accompanied by the grunts and murmurs of weary workers . Less clearly , he could hear voices off to his left , which told him that Kanan Naab had found Akbal and had brought him to the stone . Retying his loincloth , Balam Xoc headed toward the voices , following a mon-spotted path through the trees . He emerged into the open a few paces from the stone and its surrounding shelter , which cast a solid black shadow in the moonlight . Akbal had one hand on one of the shelter 's support poles and was reaching up with the other to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder to Kanan Naab . Seeing Balam Xoc , he immediatelyp160fell silent , and both he and his sister turned to bow as their grandfather came forward . " Thank you , my daughter , " Balam Xoc said to Kanan Naab , who made another brief bow . " I did not have to search far , Grandfather , " she explained . " He had already come here on his own . " Kanan Naab exchanged a glance with her brother and took a step backward , expecting to be dismissed . " Stay , my daughter , " Balam Xoc commanded . " I wish to speak to both of you . " Kanan Naab stepped forward without hesitation , drawing a disconcerted nod from Akbal , who had also obviously expected this to be a private conversation . " I know there are things you have saved to tell me , " Balam Xoc said , lifting his chin in Akbal 's direction , " but there will be time for us to talk later . Surely , you will not forget what you have learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Akbal admitted , nodding in apology to his sister . Balam Xoc stared at them in the moonlight : the tall , slender young man with the string of polished grey shells around his neck  --  a gift from Zac Kuk  --  and the marks of the tumpline still visible upon his forehead ; and the young woman who came barely to his shoulder , her blunt features enlivened by an animation reminiscent of her mother , her eyes glowing with the devotion she always showed toward her grandfather . Balam Xoc stared at them and felt nothing , except a muted , impersonal satisfaction at their openness to him . " The feast tonight was a great success , " he said at last . " I must thank both of you for that . You , my daughter , for seeing that our relatives and guests were well fed and sent away happy . And you , Akbal , for providing us with the opportunity to come together as a clan . I did not know , when I chose to make you a symbol , that you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Akbal queried , frowning uncertainly . " Yes . A symbol of our independence from the ruler 's favor . A symbol that his scorn and neglect can not harm us , but only serves to make us stronger . You were the living proof of that when you came before the clan council with your commissions and your advice for Cab Coh . " " Indeed , " Kanan Naab murmured , lowering her eyes in embarrassment when Akbal gave her a surprised glance . Balam Xoc squinted at her knowingly but went on without comment : " You know that I have a special regard for the two of you . But it is not , as you may think , because you are my grandchildren . Kinich Kakmoo is also my grandchild , and my feelings toward him are no different than they are toward you . " Balam Xoc paused and looked at each of them in turn , emphasizinghis seriousness . " That is because I no longer experience the emotions that once governed my life , and tied me to other people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has breathed her coldness into my lungs and heart , so that all I can feel is the strength of my purpose . I no longer look to other people for friendship , or approval , or affection . I see in them only what must be changed : the fear or selfishness or confusion that clouds their judgment and prevents them from laying claim to their lives . " Akbal and Kanan Naab stared at him with wide eyes , seeming incapable ofp161expression . The wind ruffled the thatch on the shelter 's roof , producing a ragged , scratching sound . " I regard you as special , " Balam Xoc continued , " because I see no sign of these impediments in your characters . You are curious and eager , and do not need to be pushed to change . You require only the opportunity to recognize and pursue your own ambitions , and I have tried to provide this for you . Yet in doing so , I have given rise to another possible impediment . That is your attachment to me . " Kanan Naab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sidelong glance at her brother . Akbal wet his lips , blinking as if the moonlight had become too bright for him . Balam Xoc stood silently , allowing them to dwell upon the uneasiness his words had aroused . " The high priest has made me famous , " he said finally , with a sardonic smile . " Perhaps even more famous than the Tikal Painter- . This has drawn people to the clan from a wide area , and many of them have chosen to stay and attach themselves to us . Some are learned men who wish to discuss my views with me , and some are seekers who come to sit in silence with the holy man . All of them , even the skeptics , want my attention and approval ; they would like me to notice them and dote upon them like grandchildren . " I do not say this to mock them , " Balam Xoc added swiftly , holding up a hand to Kanan Naab , who was looking at him dazedly , " but only because their need is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their energy and devotion , and they can not find it in the places where they live . I am willing to share the cause of our clan with any who are willing to take it up , so I indulge their need to be close to me , and give them my time . " But there is yet another group of people who come to me , most often on the days when I am sitting as the Living Ancestor . They are poor people , without the means to spend more than a few hours away from their work . They are not drawn to me by my fame , or the need for a cause . Their cause is simply to keep themselves and their families alive ; they are unable to seek anything greater . Some of these have told me that I appeared to them in their dreams and made them believe there was hope for the future . Their faces make me believe them , though I do not have the power to travel in my dreams . Others claim that their lives have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or which they have clearly misunderstood . I believe them , as well , even when my reason tells me they are mistaken . I know that this is the work of the Spirit Woman , and not my influence at all , and I try to tell them that . But few of them can hear me , and fewer still can accept that I have no powers beyond my message . They would rather believe me uncanny , and give their lives to me , than have them for themselves . It is what they are used to , however much they have been betrayed in the past . " Balam Xoc paused and raised his hands at his sides , palms up , urging them to understand him correctly . " So perhaps you see how much work lies ahead . This is only the beginning : Many more will come to our side before the katun is completed , and still others will rise up to resist us . I may never have the chance to speak to you like this again , my children , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or abandoning my concern for your welfare . But I can not allow you to join those who look to me for solace and direction . You arc capable of providing thesep162things for yourselves , and you must do so . The spirit of the Jaguar Paw is within each of you ; it is a memory in your blood . You have only to let yourselves remember , and you will know how to live your lives . " Balam Xoc stopped talking abruptly and crossed his arms in front of his chest , patiently awaiting their reply . His tone had never varied during the course of his entire speech , and his face was similarly calm and composed . Akbal and Kanan Naab looked at each other intently , as if to confirm that they were both here , and awake . Kanan Naab gave a deferential nod , urging her brother to speak . " We will honor your words , Grandfather , " Akbal promised , drawing anothernod from Kanan Naab . " We will serve the cause of our people in any way we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There must be others besides myself who know how to act on behalf of themselves and the clan . " Balam Xoc gestured toward the shelter . " I have already given you the stone , Akbal . Do not let your work and your family distract you from it totally ; let it teach you the things you need to know . And share your knowledge with your sister , so that the two of you may help each other . The truth is your stone , my daughter , " he said to Kanan Naab , " and you have my permission to seek it , and let it make its mark upon you . " The moon had sunk to the level of the trees , slanting its light across their upper bodies , so that the two young people bowed into shadow as Balam Xoc raised a hand over them in blessing . " Let us go to our rest , my children , " he said quietly , pointing the way back to the houses . " Let us renew ourselves for the tasks we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alkalche east of the city when the messenger came , telling him that his wife 's labor had begun . Accepting the congratulatory smile of his assistant , Chac Mut , with a brief nod , Pacal cast a proprietary glance over his surroundings . He was standing on one of the raised fields built up over the swamp , in the middle of a long row of maize plants whose tasseled heads rose a full foot above his own and whose ripening ears were bending double from their own weight . The bushy cotton plants on more distant fields seemed equally healthy , and the sprawling foliage of the manioc and macal was a luxuriant dark green . The fish that lived in the well-dredged canals were spawning , and a crowd of women and children had come out of the nearby houses to gather the fish eggs with reed scoops and spear the slow-moving fish . " Tell my wife that I am coming to her , " Pacal said to the messenger , and the boy darted off , picking his path between the tall plants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord , " Chac Mut offered in a relaxed tone , revealing how easy he expected the task to be . Pacal nodded tolerantly , acknowledging the confidence that both of them felt about this crop , even though neither would speak of it aloud . The ruler had made a maximum commitment of men and resources at the beginning of the season , even sending his warriors out into the fields , and the weather had been almost extravagantly cooperative . Every available piece of land , including plots that were due to lie fallow , had been planted , mostly in maize and cotton , and the gamble seemed to be paying off handsomely . The shortness of the fallow hadp166led to some severe infestations of maize borers , but the extra fields under cultivation more than made up for the few that had to be burned off because of insects . The winds had been mostly gentle , and it seemed inconceivable that the bad luck of the previous year would be repeated . It seemed more likely that the ruler 's prayers and penance would hold off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would redeem him from his troubles . " It is in your hands , then , " Pacal said absently , and headed for the shore at a leisurely pace , luxuriating in the circumstances that allowed him to leave his work in the middle of the morning , in a season usually so tense and hectic . It was a good sign , and it made him feel strongly , as he walked toward his home , that this was a good day for a birthing . UPON ENTERING her uncle 's house , Kanan Naab paused only long enough to let her eyes adjust to the dimness , then went directly to the small circle of men seated in the corner . She bowed to Nohoch Ich and the other older men and waited silently to be recognized . When Nohoch finally asked what she desired , she looked straight at Yaxal Can  --  who was sitting next to her uncle  --  and asked to know the number and sign of the day . Yaxal hesitated , pursing his lips in disapproval . He did not like the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did have her grandfather 's permission , and this seemed a particularly trivial request . But Nohoch signaled brusquely for him to supply the information , knowing that Yaxal had been on duty that morning , and would already have consulted the tzolkin , the Book of Day Signs . " It is the day Nine Oc , my lady , " the young man explained , " the eighth day of the month Xul . It is an auspicious number , a good day for undertaking new projects . " " I have not heard you ask the day 's sign for a long time , my daughter , " Nohoch said in an innocent tone . " I thought that you had shed your concern for such things . " " I do not ask for myself , " Kanan Naab told him , with an archness meant for Yaxal . " The Lady Ixchel has begun her labor , and it is important for her to know this . I do not know why . " " Well , do not let us keep you , " Nohoch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must you not ? " Kanan Naab blushed but managed to smile at her uncle . She knew that he was really teasing Yaxal for his stiffness , and she liked him for it . She glanced at Yaxal , who was regarding her solemnly , with the absence of expression that was his way of showing his disappointment in her . She felt her irritation like a prickling dryness on her tongue , and had to prevent herself from making a spiteful face at him . " Yes , I must , " she said swiftly , bowing to the men as she rose to her feet . " Thank you , young man , " she added for Yaxal 's benefit , making only the briefest of bows before turning her back and walking purposefully from the room . DucKING his head under the low doorway of the craft house , Akbal stepped snit onto the plaza and paused to stretch his body , kneading the stained fingersp167of his painting hand . Automatically , his mind began to catalogue all the things he had to do next : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on his house , another porter still had to be hired to transport his commissioned work to Ektun , and he had promised Cab Coh that he would inspect the set of bowls they had just received from the potters .. . No , Akbal decided rebelliously , I must have a few moments to myself first . He had been painting all morning without a rest , finishing the last pieces for Ektun , and he knew that he would have to return to the craft house once he had gotten his other chores out of the way . He had never worked this hard in his life , except perhaps for the days he had spent training the painters in Yaxchilan . That feat now seemed to him to have been merely practice , his training for the life his talent and ambitions had brought him . He was proud of his discipline , which made him feel mature and responsible , a man worthy of a wife and a house of his own . But there were other times  --  like this one  --  when he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less the time to think them , and he began to yearn for the lost freedom of his boyhood . Taking a quick glance around , he saw Cab Coh descending the stairs from the upper plaza and immediately started off in the opposite direction , hoping to get away before his master could accost him with more chores . There was now a second house on the north side of the plaza , beside that of Kinich Kakmoo , and Akbal gazed upon it with undiminished satisfaction as he hurriedpast . It was the same size and rectangular shape as his brother 's , raised upon a platform three steps above the level of the plaza . But instead of the usual three doorways in front , it had five , in the style of the airy Ektun houses to which Zac Kuk was accustomed . It was still only half plastered and lacked a roof , but Akbal expected to have the men to raise and thatch the roof once the harvest had been completed . Akbal slowed his pace a bit when he was safely around the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cookhouse would stand and the fig tree that he and Kal Cuc had prepared as a perch for Zac Kuk 's pet birds . Akbal smiled to himself at the memory of the boy 's hunterly disdain for the very notion of pets , even though Kal Cuc looked after the family 's flock of domesticated turkeys . He had made it clear to Akbal that he would be willing to tolerate Chuen only because there was not much meat on a spider monkey . Perhaps he is too much of a hunter to consider the alternative I have to offer , Akbal thought , as he came out of the trees and saw Kal Cuc sitting in front of the stone , in the shade of its sheltering roof . Akbal was not surprised to find him here , for he did so frequently , and he had almost come to consider the boy a kind of accessory to the stone , like the shelter itself . It was Kanan Naab  --  herself a frequent visitor to the stone  --  who had made him consider the significance of finding Kal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulate the proposal he was about to make . Kal Cuc was sitting facing the stone , with the Zuyhua weapon and his quiver of short spears across his bony knees . The throwing stick had been Akbal 's gift to him for having rebuilt the shelter in Akhal 's absence , and Kal Cuc had fashioned his own short spears so as not to lose the originals . He did not jump up at Akhal 's approach , a sign of how comfortable he had become in the young man 's presence . Or perhaps , Akbal thought as he squatted beside him , how couufurtablr they both were in the presence of the stone.  | " You have been practicing ? " Akbal asked casually , nodding toward the weapon . Kal Cuc shrugged wearily . " There has been no time today . I have been fetching wood and water for my grandmother and the other midwives . " Akbal started guiltily and looked back toward his father 's house , reminded of another obligation . " The Lady Ixchel has not borne her child yet , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , " Kal Cuc replied without enthusiasm . " I will have to go for more wood in a moment . " " How is your skill with the weapon ? " Akbal inquired , allowing himself to relax . Kal Cuc 's narrow face brightened a bit at the question , and he pursed his lips judiciously , as if striving to make his response sound professional . " I am very good with it in the open , where there is room to throw , and nothing between me and my target . The alkalches are the best places to use it . I almost got a heron the other day , but a reed deflected my throw . " Kal Cuc paused and swallowed , letting Akbal know that he did not wish to hurt his feelings . " It is not so useful in hunting in the forest , though . In fact , it is no good at all where the jungle is thick . " " I will tell this to my brother , the nacom , before he goes off to fight the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he grew more serious . " But I want to talk to you about something more important . It has occurred to me that you are almost twelve , the age of apprenticeship , and that you have no sponsor within the clan . " Kal Cuc lowered his eyes and nodded tentatively , then peered up at Akbal with a wary expectancy . " I would like to know if you have your heart set upon becoming a hunter , " Akbal said in a neutral tone . " It is possible that such a thing could be arranged with some of our clanspeople who live on the outskirts of the city . " " Ah ! " Kal Cuc blurted , then lapsed into a thoughtful silence , glancing once at the stone . " My grandmother would be alone if I left her , " he decided glumly . " She is old , and depends on my help . " " Many of us depend on your help , " Akbal told him in a reassuring tone . " I have another suggestion , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I recently spoke to some people from the Flint Clan , the stone carvers who taught me what little I know of that craft . They have been gifted with more daughters than sons , and have begun to look outside their own family for apprentices . " The boy looked again at the stone , then back at Akbal , unable , in his surprise , to do more than stare . " They do not live far from here , " Akbal continued , " so you would not have to leave your grandmother or this House . I know that you are good with your hands , and there is always work for skilled carvers . The clan would be grateful to hire a carver who is one of our own , rather than contracting with outsiders . " Kal Cuc cast a third glance at the stone , making Akbal realize how right Kanan Naab had been . He had decided beforehand to phrase his proposal in practical terms , remembering Kal Cuc 's initial skepticism at the value Akbal himself put on the stone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more practical person than he was himself . Kanan Naab had insisted that the boy 's fascination with the stone was as personally compelling , and as inexplicit/ble , as Akbal 's own , and would matter more to him than any promise of future employment . " I will also need help myself one day , " Akbal suggested , " whenever I am finally ready to put my mark upon this stone . You could do much to help me prepare it in the meantime , when you have time away from your apprentice-ship . " " You would let me assist you ? " Kal Cuc managed , his excitement struggling with his disbelief . Akbal smiled broadly , as much in recognition of his sister 's perspicacity as in confirmation of the boy 's hopes . " I will depend upon it . " Kal Cuc was suddenly all gratitude , bowing and murmuring his thanks over and over again , despite Akbal 's pleased demurrals . A broad shadow fell over them , and this time Kal Cuc jumped hastily to his feet , clutching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not slow to follow when he saw that their visitor was Kinich Kakmoo . Kal Cuc bowed to the warchief , who cast a significant glance at the Zuyhua weapon , and then at Akbal himself . Akbal signaled with his eyes that the boy could go , and Kal Cuc dashed off , leaving the two brothers alone in front of the stone . They faced each other in silence , having shared no words in the seven months since their return to Tikal ; indeed , having not spoken since their argument in Ektun . Kinich spent most of his time in the company of the ruler and the other warchiefs , or away on maneuvers with his warriors . Despite his prestige , he was no more comfortable around the Jaguar Paw House than was their father , and he had not forgiven those who had chosen to spurn his feast . He seemed both older and thinner to Akbal , as if his broad , Sky Clan features had begun to set in hard lines . " So that is what you think of my gift , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction Kal Cuc had gone . Akbal drew himself up defensively , preparing a retort on the free nature of gifts . But Kinich 's breathing whistled harshly through his broken nose , a sign of his nervousness , and there had been no real edge to the accusation . " He treasures it , and has learned to throw with it , " Akbal explained . " He tells me that it is useless for fighting in the jungle , though . " Kinich narrowed his eyes for a moment , then laughed loudly . " Yes ! " he exclaimed with apparent pleasure . " I will remember that . A good nacom learns from even the humblest warrior . " Akbal nodded cautiously , waiting to learn what had brought his brother here . Nothing had changed within the family ; if anything , the lines had been drawn more sharply , and they were still on opposite sides . Kinich seemed to acknowledge this by refusing to meet Akbal 's eyes fully , glancing instead at his headwrap , his paint-stained hands , and once  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am told that Ixchel 's labor has begun , " the warrior said finally . " My wife is one of those who attend her . It seems proper that we should both be there for the birth of our father 's child . Do you not agree ? " " It is most proper , " Akbal agreed without hesitation , though it was for Ixchel 's sake , and not their father 's , that he had intended to look in on her . " It is also proper for brothers to mend their differences , " Kinich said in the same stiff tone , " and be friends . "  |p170Akbal  could see the effort this attempt at reconciliation was costing his brother , but the memory of Kinich twisting his arm and threatening him was still too powerful to allow him to reply immediately . And he had to wonder what his friendship could be worth to Kinich , who was now on equal terms with the most important men in the city . Unless , Akbal thought with a flash of insight , my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship and gratitude mean to men like the ruler .. . " I am willing to forget the past , " Akbal proposed , and Kinich responded almost too quickly , obviously relieved that an apology was not being demanded of him . " And I , as well . I can tell you truthfully that I have never held any grudge toward you on account of the feast . " Hearing the slight emphasis Kinich put on " you , " Akbal understood that his brother 's tolerance did not extend to Balam Xoc or the clan members who had followed him in this instance . The depth of his loyalty to his grandfather made Akbal hesitate , wondering if this reconciliation did not constitute a betrayal of the people who had honored him instead of Kinich . But then he remembered Balam Xoc urging him to be independent , and to follow what was in his heart and blood . Brothers should be friends , even if their differences had to be overlooked rather than resolved ; the clan could not be hurt by a compassionateresponse to his brother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Akbal said sincerely . " Let us go to see Ixchel . " Kinich 's face softened for just a moment , before he huffed through his nose and regained his solemn warrior 's demeanor . " I am ready . . . Brother , " he said self-consciously , and the two of them turned and marched off  --  in step  --  toward their father 's house . AT THE DOORWAY to her stepmother 's room , Kanan Naab was met by Kinich Kakmoo 's wife , May , who gripped her arm and whispered to her in a strained voice . " You must find a way to calm her , Kanan Naab . She is fighting against the pains and will not move her muscles in time with them . " Kanan Naab murmured reassuringly and released herself from May 's grasp , entering the dimly lit room , which was warm and smoky from the charcoal braziers in the corners . Ixchel squatted naked against the far wall , her back against the stone bench , her arms held by women who squatted on both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathed in sweat , and a thin stream of blood trickled from her vagina , onto the soft , cloth-covered mats beneath her . Walking around the midwives who knelt in front of Ixchel , Kanan Naab relieved Kal Cuc 's grandmother , who rose gratefully from Ixchel 's side , gruntingwith the effort of straightening her aged limbs . Ixchel quivered in Kanan Naab 's hands , and every contraction struck her tensed body with a concerted jolt that made her roll her eyes and cry out incoherently . Kanan Naab spoke to her softly for several moments before she was certain Ixchel knew who she was . " It is the day Nine Oc , Ixchel , " she said in a very clear voice . " Nine Oc. "  |p171Ixchel  jerked her head toward Kanan Naab , almost pulling free from the woman on her other side . " Nine Oc ! " she exclaimed hoarsely , staring at Kanan Naab with wild eyes . " Do you remember  --  ? " The contraction occurred in midsentence , and her whole body arched with it , too suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their approval , encouraging Kanan Naab with their eyes . " Take shallow breaths , " Kanan Naab instructed the gasping woman , but Ixchel seemed only intent on regaining her ability to speak . " Do you remember , Kanan Naab ? " she managed between gasps . " The night your grandfather came ? The night we wore flowers in our hair ? " " I remember , " Kanan Naab assured her , holding tight as another contraction , more powerful than the last , surged through Ixchel 's body . " That was Nine Oc . . . too , " Ixchel hissed , her eyes opening and closing spasmodically . " Your father . . . that night ... " " Do not speak . Breathe , " Kanan Naab urged , though she understood now why the day sign had been so important to Ixchel . The same sign and number would reoccur in combination only after a full cycle of the tzolkin  --  two hundred and sixty days  --  had been completed , a period quite close in duration to the normal term of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby had been conceived on the night of Balam Xoc 's visit , the last day Nine Oc , and that it had chosen the same day to come forth into the world . The significance that this information had for Ixchel was manifest in a sudden relaxation of all her resistance to the contractions , which were now beginning to come in fast succession . Ixchel strained back against the bench behind her , pushing out from her middle with all her strength , so that Kanan Naab and the woman on the other side had to strain themselves to hold on to her sweat-slippery arms . The head of the child , matted with black hair , appeared between her legs , and the midwives moved in to massage Ixchel 's abdomen and draw the child forth . Ixchel 's nails dug into Kanan Naab 's arm , pulling her close , so that their heads were almost touching . Ixchel 's eyes were closed , but she was murmuring to herself , blowing the words out between deep , groaning gasps for breath . It was , Kanan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the child being born : " A Jaguar Paw child . . . for you , Grandfather , a Jaguar Paw child . . . for you ... " PACAL SAT close to his wife upon the bench , warming one of her hands in his own . But most of his attention was upon his new son , whose red , wrinkled face was visible among the bundled cloths that Box Ek , a proud grandaunt , was holding across her lap . May was sitting on the other side of Box Ek , and Kinich was kneeling in front of the bench to examine his half brother ; Akbal stood at a slight distance , easily able to see over the heads of the women crowding in around the baby . Pacal felt a tug on his hands and inclined his head so that Ixchel could whisper in his ear . " Do you remember , my husband , the night your father came to eat with us ? The night you stayed up late with him , but then came to me afterward , seeming far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her face , which wore a dreamy smile over the lines and hollows of her fatigue , giving her the appearance of extreme intoxication . He saw that her memory of that night was a happy one , and he automatically concealed the ambivalence his own memories aroused in him . " You were very beautiful that night , " he said soothingly . " But why do you remember it now ? " " It was the night our child was conceived , " Ixchel told him in a thrilled whisper . " It was under the sign Nine Oc , the same sign that ruled over his birth today . " " That is indeed marvelous , " Pacal said , trying to keep the skepticism out of his voice . It would be cruel , given her present state , to point out that she could not possibly be certain of such a thing . His ardor had been unusual that night , buoyed by the false euphoria of having obtained the use of Akbal , but it could not have been the only time they lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child for five years , after all . But he did not say any of this to Ixchel , simply patting her hand and smiling to humor the rapt conviction in her eyes . He looked up as Kanan Naab appeared at Ixchel 's side with a red flower in her hand . The two women smiled at each other without speaking , ignoring Pacal 's presence entirely , and then Kanan Naab reached forward to fix the flower into the coils of her stepmother'shair . " He is coming , " Kanan Naab said softly , exchanging a meaningful glance with Ixchel . " Who is coming ? " Pacal demanded more loudly than he had intended , unaccountably irritated by his daughter 's gesture . Kanan Naab stared back at him for a moment , then at Kinich , who had risen to his feet beside her . " Grandfather , " she replied firmly , in the sudden silence following Pacal 's outburst . Kinich shifted uneasily and glanced at the doorway , as if contemplatingan escape . But it was too late , for Balam Xoc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a path for him , bowing low to the Living Ancestor . " Greetings , my sister , " he said to Box Ek , ignoring the weighty presence of Kinich , who took a few steps to the side , away from him . Box Ek proudly offered up the bundle in her lap , and Balam Xoc lifted the child against his chest , looking tenderly at the tiny clenched face . " He is a boy child , " Box Ek reported , " and healthy in all his parts . " " You have brought us a great gift , my daughter , " Balam Xoc said to Ixchel . " We are all proud of your courage . " Ixchel shyly lowered her eyes , clasping her hands in front of her body . " I am but a poor woman from Nohmul , Grandfather , and I have little courage . But I am certain of one thing : This is a Jaguar Paw child , a gift of the spirit you have brought to your people . " " The spirit lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xoc told her gently , placing the baby in her arms , " for you have joined yourself to us . I accept your son , and yours , Pacal , " he added to his son , " in the name of the Jaguar Protector , and of the Spirit Woman who watches over our clan . " " I want to name him Bolon Oc , after the sign of this day , " Ixchel blurted suddenly , lifting her eyes to Balam Xoc , and then turning the same imploring look upon her husband . Pacal was momentarily nonplussed , then angry at thisp173usurpation of his prerogative as a father . He had already decided to name a male child Chac Balam , after his older brother , who had died , and it had never even occurred to him to consult with Ixchel . Now he was being asked to do so in public ! " Does this name have a special significance for you , my daughter ? " Balam Xoc asked in an interested tone , and Pacal could feel his wife turn expectantly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he stubbornly refused to meet her gaze , glancing instead at Kinich , whose narrowed eyes shared his anger and sent him support . " Yes , " Ixchel said timidly , and paused for a long moment before going on in a quick , flat voice : " He was conceived under this sign . And it is the sign under which he has been born . " The women in the room collectively caught their breath , then broke out in appreciative murmurs . " What do you say to this , my son ? " Balam Xoc inquired of Pacal . " Do you choose to honor your wife 's wish ? " Pacal looked around at his other children , seeing encouragement in Kanan Naab 's eyes and judgment in Akbal 's ; Kinich had bared his glittering teeth , urging him silently to refuse . All of the other women in the room wore expressions similar to that of Kanan Naab , instinctively taking the side of the new mother . Finally , he looked at Ixchel , expecting her to shrink from him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there was no guilt in the dark eyes that stared back into his ; only a puzzled kind of disappointment , as if his attitude were utterly incomprehensible to her . As it would have to be , Pacal thought sadly , since she did not know that the night she rememberedso fondly had cost him the respect of another of his sons . Now this son , too , would go to Balam Xoc , who had used what he had learned that night to betray Pacal before the clan council . But Ixchel could not know this , either , though she had suffered from her husband 's increasing isolation within the clan . Pacal was struck by guilt of his own , which made it impossible to bear the disappointment in Ixchel 's eyes . " Let him be called Bolon Oc Balam , then , " he said , in a voice that caught in his throat before bursting free , a voice that was trying to make resignation sound decisive . Kinich made a disgusted noise and stalked out of the room ; beyond where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which remained judgmental , as if he saw his father 's capitulation for what it was . But Ixchel had thrust the baby into his arms and was pressing her lips against his cheek in gratitude , and the other women were smiling and congratulating him , calling out the new child 's name . The warm little bundle in Pacal 's arms squirmed and let out a small cry , and Pacal instinctively pressed the child against his heart . " Welcome , my son , " he said dazedly , clutching the bundle to him as if afraid it might disappear . " Welcome to the home of your people , Bolon Oc Balam . " WHEN ' t Hl , TIME of the harvest finally arrived , late in the month of Yaxkin , the sun shone brightly over Tikal , upon fields that had suffered no damage from wind or rain . Every available man , woman , and child had turned out for the task , along with a large part of the army , and still the cutting and gatheringp174went on for over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's long history , larger than any that could be recalled from the records or the memories of the elders . Rows of loosely thatched huts had to be built in a field near the marketplace to house the surplus maize , and the royal storehouses were overflowing with baskets of beans , squash , and manioc , as well as thick bundles of raw cotton and sheaves of fragrant mai , the smoking leaf . There were feasts in even the poorest of houses , and the clan priests presided over elaborate ceremonies of thanksgiving , the first to be held in almost four years . With the same suddenness , the ruler 's stewards once more found themselves the dispensers of plenty rather than the defenders of shortage , and were reminded of the pleasure they had once taken in their work . A respectful equanimity supplanted the acrimony that had characterized their dealings with the heads of the clans , and the merchants from other cities now approachedthem with a kind of awe , as if they , too , had forgotten how truly powerful Tikal was . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sense of vindication was so overwhelming that they impulsively went ahead with long-deferred purchases and improvements to their homes , before the royal revenues had even begun to be counted . Pacal , however , was not one of those who indulged in such optimistic gestures . Three more growing seasons remained within Katun ii Ahau , and there was always the chance that they would be as bad as the three previous to this one . The Katun Enclosure would have to be completed during this same period of time , as well , which would mean far fewer men for everything else that needed to be done . Pacal did not share his father 's militant concern for the future , but he had been affected by it , and he felt strongly that the affairs of the city had reached a critical juncture . This crop had been a great gift , and they could not afford to squander the advantage it had given them . They dared not squander it , if they hoped to have any future at all . Important decisions  --  crucial ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made very soon , and rumors had already begun to circulate among the lords in the palace . The one most frequently repeated was that the ruler was planning a major military campaign , to be waged in concert with Yaxchilan . Another , which was actually discussed more thoroughly by the other stewards , was that the stewardship itself was to undergo some sort of reorganization . Caan Ac himself was being extremely closemouthed , apparently waiting for the scheduledstewards ' council to reveal his intentions fully . After consulting with all of his sources , Pacal came to the conclusion that no one had been entrusted with more than rumors , and that Caan Ac was making no effort to secretly win allies or arrange for a consensus . He was acting alone again , on his own counsel , as he had in the case of the burial vase . He intends to buy our acquiescence , Pacal reasoned , and given the wealth presentlyat his disposal , plus the possibility of some new titles to be distributed among the stewards , it seemed likely that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacal decided abruptly that he could not wait until the council meeting to know what those ends were , or to exert whatever influence he could upon them . He had been left out of last year 's negotiations , and then had been called upon to make them work , at a high personal cost to himself . For the sake of his own self-respect , if not the respect of his family , he could not allow himself to support a policy again in which he had had nop175say , or which he could not adequately defend . Allowing himself no time for second thoughts , he sent a message to the ruler asking , as a " personal favor , " for a private interview . Caan Ac summoned him later that same afternoon , receiving him on the long terrace that overlooked the ravine behind the ruler 's palace . A single line of breadnut trees shaded the southern edge of the terrace , and between their evenly spaced trunks Pacal could see the still waters of the palace reservoir , tinted a deep crimson by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canopied throne had been set up in the shade of the trees , facing the western horizon , which was dominated by the immense funerary temple of his father , Cauac Caan . The tall roof comb of the temple 's shrine jutted blackly against the side of the sun 's red face , which was sinking slowly toward the horizon , to the left of the pyramid itself . Crossing his chest , Pacal bowed low before the ruler , whose eyes were protected from the sun 's glare by a thick fringe of knotted threads hanging from the front edge of the canopy . He gestured for Pacal to sit facing him and waved away the guards who had accompanied him across the terrace . Caan Ac had recently celebrated his fifty-fifth year of life , ten more than Pacal , and the hair that showed beneath his elaborate headwrap was mostly grey . He sat , as always , with his stubby legs dangling down in front of his throne . " This must be important to you , Pacal . It has not been that long since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most important , my lord . I did not think it could wait until the council meeting , when I would have to clamor for your attention . " " You have my attention , " Caan Ac replied smoothly . " What is it you wish to say ? Or is it something you wish to know ? " " It is both , my lord , " Pacal admitted . " The palace is alive with rumors , and it is difficult to know what to believe , or how to prepare myself for the meeting . " " Do you suffer more from not knowing than the other stewards ? " Caan Ac demanded sarcastically . " Or would you use your favor to buy an advantage over them ? " Pacal simply stared at him , surprised by the cynicism of the ruler 's response , and by how deeply it offended him . He was not ordinarily a man who was easily offended , especially by the accusation of personal interest . But it had never seemed so unfair , so undeserved , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I seek an advantage , my lord ? " he asked in return . " My clan rejects everything I bring to them . I have only you , and our city , to serve . And yes , my lord , I suffer from being kept in ignorance . We all do . You did not used to be so secretive with us . " Caan Ac grunted and looked away toward the reservoir , watching the swallows and purple martins that swooped gracefully above the gleaming red surface of the water . From somewhere farther off in the ravine , the hooting of a wood owl mingled and overlapped with the guttural hut-hut of a motmot . " You are not one who has complained to me before , " Caan Ac allowed finally , turning back to Pacal , " so I must regard what you say with serious concern . What rumors have you heard ? " " I have heard that a military campaign is being planned . " " That is true . Shield Jaguar is organizing a campaign against the Macaws ,  |p176and  Zotz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the rulers of Yaxche , Bonampak , Acantun , and Lacanha . Should Tikal not have a share of the glory ? It would help to reassure those who depend upon us for protection , and to test the fitness of our warriors . " " The cost of such an expedition would be great , " Pacal ventured , but Caan Ac shook off the objection with an impatient jerk of his head . " The cost will be repaid many times over by the lands and goods that our warriors take in conquest . Have you forgotten how easily your son and his men put the Macaws to flight ? We must not retreat into ourselves , Pacal , now that we have the means to enlarge our prestige ! That is why I keep my plans to myself , so that they will not be picked at and diminished by men without courage or imagination . " " I have no desire to diminish our prestige , Lord , " Pacal said quietly , " but my sense of duty compels me to consider all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enclosure must be completed , and we are far behind schedule . And if we divert our workmen to that , how will we manage the next crop ? We had use of the army this season , and we took a great risk in choosing to expand the size of the planting . We are fortunate that we have the means to replenish our stores of seed , but new land will have to be cleared for burning if we are to avoid a serious problem with insects , and the reservoirs and raised fields should not go another season without repair . The rains were gentle as well as timely this year , and did little of the damage they have often done in the past . Can we hope to be so lucky again ? " " The rains are my responsibility , " Caan Ac said , pointing a blunt finger at his own chest . " As to the problem of workmen , we will hire those we need from the clans , and from Uaxactun and the other nearby cities . They have all seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we can pay , even if we only give them a small amount in advance . We can also promise them a bonus for their trust , to be paid later out of the loot brought back by the warriors . Those who will not trust us , " Caan Ac added pointedly , " we will pay in full . But I expect this only from your own clan and a few others . " Pacal nodded absently , knowing that it would be more than just a few , given the growth of Balam Xoc 's influence . And if word got out that one clan was being paid in full , the others might reconsider their trust in bonuses . But this was a minor flaw , compared with some of the others Pacal had already perceivedin the ruler 's plan . Especially vexing was the utter impossibility of estimating the value of what the warriors might bring back ; that alone made all the figures Pacal had been compiling in his head seem vaporous and unreliable . He suddenly felt very tired , and offered his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little hope of being heeded . " If we did not have to hire so many workmen , though , " he suggested , " we would be free to use our surplus for trade . We could renew our ties with the cities to the east and south : with Holmul , Nakum , and Yaxha , and with Pusilha and Copan . We would not have to accept whatever Yaxchilan chose to offer . I have heard that they have an abundance of cacao again this year , and no intention of lowering their terms . " " But we have maize , and cotton , " Caan Ac said with annoyance , " anti both are more valuable in the west . You try my patience with this quibbling , Pacal . You know that my grandfather , Cacao Moon , returned to Tikal from Actin/tun , with the backing of Shield Jaguar the Elder . Would you have me tamper with our most important alliance for the sake of a few ears of maize ? I am the Sky Clan ruler , and I will rule this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Pacal bowed in compliance , though the gesture , to himself , was truly one of resignation . He could no longer recall what he had hoped to accomplish with this interview , beyond some dim desire to prove his own influence . Perhaps his motives had been more personal than he had realized ; perhaps he had come here to test the suspicions his father had planted in his mind . " Do not look so forlorn , Pacal , " Caan Ac scolded him . " I value your advice , and surely there is maize enough to trade with these other cities . But you will not have to concern yourself with such matters in the future . I have already decided to make you the chief steward of crops . It would have been a surprise for you , had you been willing to wait until the stewards ' council . " " Chief steward ? " Pacal said blankly , and Caan Ac 's fleshy face broadened into a self-satisfied smile . " You heard no rumors of that ? It is a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stewards , one each for crops , construction , administration , trade , and procurement for the army . Each will have the authority to appoint their own subordinates from among the ranks of the stewards , and each will be responsible only to me and the council of chief stewards . So you see , I wish to give you the power to deal with the very problems of which you have spoken . Unless , of course , you would prefer to play a lesser role in the management of our city . . . ? " Despite the knowledge that his hesitation alone could cost him the promotion , Pacal could not bring himself to respond immediately . He had a brief , irrational urge to consult with his father , which so flustered him that he grew angry with himself . Was this not proof of his influence and his value to the ruler ? Should he refuse the power being offered him and allow it to fall to another , perhaps one less able than himself ? Pacal looked up and saw the ruler standing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world for a few moments , locked in a fierce , silent argument with himself . Caan Ac raised him to his feet and turned him toward the west , where the sun was falling beneath the horizon in a molten red mass . The great temple of Cauac Caan stood entirely in shadow , a black hulk that seemed to have shouldered the sun aside . " You see the tomb my father built for himself , " Caan Ac said , in a voice that mingled pride and envy . " Four times the size of any other in Tikal , larger than any temple built by other men , anywhere . It is a monument that will keep the memory of Cauac Caan alive in the minds of his people forever . Will there be such a monument to mark the memory of my reign ? We both know that such a thing is impossible . It is our misfortune to live in another time , one that constrains the display of our greatness ... " Caan Ac 's voice had fallen to a low , grating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted his arms toward the sky , as if to embrace the sun 's dying splendor . " But that does not prevent us from exercising our greatness , and leaving our legacy in the hearts of men ! That is why I must insist on boldness , Pacal . We may die at any time ; let us not be forgotten while we live ! " The ruler 's shout echoed over the terrace , bringing the guards around itsp178perimeter to renewed attention . The sun was now only a curving red line clinging tenuously to the darkening horizon , and night was falling swiftly . Caan Ac seized Pacal 's arm and shook him roughly . " Do not fail me now , Pacal ! Let it be said of us that we were the men who brought our people safely through Katun Eleven Ahau . Let that be our glory , and our monument ! " The sun suddenly winked out , and darkness descended around them , so that Pacal could barely make out the face so close to his own . But the ruler had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , though more with the sheer force of his emotion . " Yes , my lord , " Pacal heard himself say , and felt the hands disappear from around his arm , leaving damp prints upon his skin . The ruler patted him once on the shoulder , then started off across the terrace , drawing his guards to him . " Yes , " Pacal repeated softly , in a whisper that echoed only in his own ears , which trapped the sound , making it seem inevitable . IN THE MONTH of Mol , Batz Mac brought his wife and family to Tikal for the wedding of Akbal and Zac Kuk . They made the first part of the journey by canoe , using the chain of small rivers that flowed from east to west and were still navigable after the good season of rain . After resting for a night in Uaxactun , where their clan had relatives , they continued south on the same trail that Akbal had used on his return , passing the stubbled maize fields where flocks of wild turkeys and currasows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance to the northern ceremonial center of the city , they were met by young Kal Cuc , who had been given the honor of guiding them to the Jaguar Paw House . Skirting the Katun Enclosures to the north , they passed several impressive housing clusters  --  one large enough to resemble a ceremonialcenter  --  before joining up with a trail that curved around the edges of an extensive alkalche . Walking at the side of her mother , Zac Kuk pretended to herself that the open water of the swamp was a river , simply to make the landscape seem more familiar . She had been well aware that Tikal was a much larger city than Ektun , but the sheer extent of the settlement had been beyond the reach of her imagination , and was still a source of astonishment . They had been walking for the better part of the morning , past houses that only grew larger and more densely clustered , toward ever more impressive plazas and ceremonial centers . There seemed no end to it , and no boundaries  --  like the hills that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Zac Kuk had the dim sense , having glimpsed the towering temple pyramids that lay farther south , that they were bypassing the actual center of the city , but she felt no regret about what she might be missing . She was already intimidated enough by her surroundings , and it was not a feeling to which she was accustomed , or one she enjoyed . Hearing a familiar squawk , she glanced back over her shoulder , past the relatives and servants immediately behind her , to the porters who carried her birds in shrouded cages upon their heads . The procession , some thirty-five people in all , had seemed impressive to her when they had set out from Ektun , but they had attracted little notice within the precincts of Tikal , and had in fact been passed several times by larger groups , including many people betterp179dressed than herself . This intimidated her perhaps more than anything else , and made her feel vaguely ashamed of her pets , which suddenly seemed like a child 's playthings , brought to comfort the child against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muan Kal exclaimed beside her . " Look how many houses they have ! And the size of the family shrine ! " But Zac Kuk did not want to look , and cast only a passing glance at the thatched-roof houses clustered among the surrounding breadnut trees , with the tall , red roof comb of the shrine thrusting up out of their midst . Instead , she looked between the men in front of her , training her eyes on the crowd of people waiting for them at the head of the trail . As they drew closer , she saw that there were actually two crowds : one composed of Akbal and the members of his immediate family , and another , much larger , which stood at a respectful distance behind the first group . Zac Kuk could not see enough of this latter group to ascertain who they were , though there were clearly too many of them to assume that they were simply the household servants . Then the men in front of her stopped , and the view between them was filled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Batz Mac . Zac Kuk 's breath came more rapidly , and her stomach tightened with excitement , though to her already daunted eye , even his face did not seem truly familiar . His features appeared to have grown thinner and more sharply defined , making him look older and more mature . " I regret that my father can not be here to greet you , my lord , " Akbal said courteously , " but his duties as the chief steward will keep him away until the time of the wedding . May I present to you my grandfather , Balam Xoc , the Living Ancestor of our clan ... " Zac Kuk craned forward so eagerly that her mother put a hand on her arm to restrain her and remind her of the proper decorum . Zac Kuk obeyed reluctantly , having obtained only a brief glimpse of the old man who had appeared at Akbal 's side . Is that him ? she wondered , experiencing a moment of disappointment that was actually a kind of relief to her . She had expected a much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gestures and all-seeing eyes . This man seemed no different from her own grandfathers , except that age had not yet made him bend or shake . " This is a joyful occasion for both our families , Batz Mac , " she heard the old man say , " so let us not stand on ceremony . Let us mingle freely , like the friends we should be . " " I would be honored to call you friend , Balam Xoc , " her father replied , and Zac Kuk envisioned the two of them clasping hands , though her view of the scene was obscured . The men ahead of her immediately broke rank , her brother , Chan Mac , going directly to Akbal , and the two sons of Box Ekwhohad come as much to celebrate their mother 's seventieth birthday as the wedding  --  stooping to embrace a tiny , shriveled woman who leaned on a polished wooden stick . Zac Kuk felt a sharp pang of jealousy at the undisguisedpleasure Akbal and Chan Mac were taking in seeing each other again , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagerness , looked up over her brother 's head and sought her out in the crowd . She lowered her eyes with the proper show of modesty , though not before she had noted how much younger his smile made him look.  |p180Her  father was bringing Balam Xoc and another , older man over to greet her and Muan Kal , and in the brief instant before she bowed with her mother , Zac Kuk 's attention was distracted by a sudden wave of movement in the background , as if the second crowd had surged forward in unison . Indeed , when she looked up again , she found that the other people had closed in behind Balam Xoc in a solid wall , close enough for her to see that they were definitely not servants . Some even seemed to be foreign lords and priests , and others wore clothing too eccentric for servants . " Welcome to the Jaguar Paw House , my lady , " Balam Xoc was saying to Muan Kal . " I hope that the journey from Ektun was not a hardship for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited Tikal , my lord , " Muan Kal said graciously . " It has only grown more impressive . " " It has grown , certainly , " Balam Xoc allowed , in a dry voice that sounded almost sarcastic to Zac Kuk 's attentive ears . But his weathered brown face did not smile , and the eyes that looked at Muan Kal were steady and without hidden meaning . He gestured toward the old man beside him . " May I present my younger brother , the Master of Craftsmen Cab Coh ... " Muan Kal hesitated for just a moment before bowing , and Zac Kuk knew that her mother was also having trouble believing what she had heard . Cab Coh 's whole body shook slightly as he bowed , and his watery eyes blinked constantly , making his smile of greeting seem as much baffled as kindly . He looked to be at least ten years older than his brother , certainly no younger . " This is my youngest daughter , Zac Kuk , " Batz Mac said in a proud voice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , before demurely raising her head to meet Balam Xoc 's eyes . Having prepared herself for this meeting , she looked back at him gravely , trying to show that she was intelligent and discreet , a woman worthy of his house . She was aware of all the staring eyes behind Balam Xoc , though she did not feel that their attention was directed at her . " You are as beautiful as Akbal has led me to believe , my child , " Balam Xoc said , in the same dry , vaguely sarcastic tone he had used earlier . " I had not expected someone so solemn , though . " Batz Mac laughed loudly at Balam Xoc 's perceptiveness , and after an obligatory , embarrassed duck of her head , Zac Kuk responded to the old man 's teasing with her most dazzling smile . But while Cab Coh 's bleary eyes widened in pleasure , Balam Xoc 's expression barely changed , and the smile that crept onto his face did so belatedly , as if without his conscious intent . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coh said with gentle enthusiasm , giving Batz Mac a congratulatory nod . " Yes , it is far from solemn , " Balam Xoc observed , and though Zac Kuk kept the smile on her face , she had to struggle to repress a shudder of foreboding . She was certain she had never met a man so utterly without warmth or affection , so beyond the reach of her smile . She had no idea how to impress such a man , and it was him , she knew , that she most needed to impress . To her surprise , though , he held out his hand to her , asking her to accompany him . " Before you go to dress for the ceremony , " he suggested , " allow me to show you the home my grandson has prepared for you . It will perhaps make you feel more welcome than I am able to . "  |p181Zac  Kuk glanced at her mother and father , who smilingly gave their consent to this unusual proposal , which had seemed to contain a note of apology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had upon her . She reached out compliantly , barely grazing Balam Xoc 's leathery hand before he turned to let her walk beside him . The crowd behind him parted automatically to make way for him , revealing how closely they had followed his every word and gesture . But Balam Xoc paid them no heed , not even bothering to explain their presenceas he led her through their midst . He spoke only to her , in a normal tone . " This is the craft house , where Akbal and the other craftsmen work under the direction of my brother , " he explained as they passed a long , thatched-roof building with many open doorways , a building that reminded her of Ektun . She could feel the crowd falling in behind her , but she tried to pay them no mind , emulating Balam Xoc 's casual disregard with great difficulty . They came around the corner of the craft house and entered a plaza somewhat larger than that of her father 's house , though she could see a still-larger plaza set well above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . Balam Xoc stopped her in front of the first house on the north side of the plaza , though his gesture also included the house that stood beside it , just to the east . " Akbal has built next door to his brother , Kinich Kakmoo , " Balam Xoc said , and Zac Kuk nodded tentatively , looking from one house to the other . " I was introduced to Kinich Kakmoo in Ektun , " she replied , for lack of anything better to say . She was not sure what she was supposed to be seeing in the two houses , and she was distracted by her awareness of the people spilling into the plaza behind her . But Balam Xoc seemed to be waiting for her response , so she made another effort , wondering if he expected her to comment on the relative freshness of the paint and thatch , which seemed a trivial difference to her . Then she suddenly noticed the two extra doorways that Akbal had built into the front of his house , and the contrast with the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh ! " she exclaimed , amazed that she could have missed it . " It is like an Ektun house , " she added hastily , embarrassed by her slowness in perceiving the difference . " That was his intention , " Balam Xoc said in a deliberately mild tone , as if he had witnessed her embarrassment but saw no reason for it . He seemed not to care how swiftly she had grasped his point , as long as she had . Zac Kuk realized that he was not only lacking in warmth but also in scorn and impatience , the emotions that led one to judge and condescend . She found this strangely reassuring , and did not hesitate to accompany him up the steps and into the central room of the three on this side of the house . The room drew light from three of the wide doorways , and while basically long and narrow in shape , it seemed very spacious beneath the steeply pitched roof . This time Zac Kuk did not fail to see the surprise that awaited her , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room . There , on the long section of wall between the doorways to the back rooms , Akbal had painted a portrait of the city of Ektun , as if seen from a high hill on the opposite side of the river . At the bottom , just above the bench against the wall , was the river itself , a powerful green swirl that licked at the black rocks that gave Ektun its name . Yellowish cliffs rose to the next level of the painting , where the various ceremonial centers were depicted in discrete segments , rising likep182a staircase from right to left , as did the city itself . Behind were the familiar green hills , jutting up into a blue sky dotted with puffs of white cloud , the sky going all the way up to the top of the wall . Zac Kuk did not know where Akbal had found such a vantage point , or if this view existed only in his imagination , but she had no doubt that she was looking at her home . It felt as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temples and monuments  --  and of one particular hill  --  were undeniably accurate . Zac Kuk turned to look at Balam Xoc , making no effort to hide the tears in her eyes . " I have no gift for him that is equal to this . " " I doubt that he would agree . Your happiness here is very important to him . " " I see that , " Zac Kuk breathed , looking again at the mural . " He warned me that it would not be easy . " " It should not be hard for you , my daughter . Surely , you have a smile for adversity , as well . " " I do not know , " Zac Kuk confessed , hiding her face when new tears sprang from her eyes . " Then you will learn , " Balam Xoc said simply . " But come : Compose yourself . You will not want the others to see you weeping . " Dabbing at her eyes with the edge of her shawl , Zac Kuk cast an anxious glance through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Who are they , Grandfather ? " she asked in a pleading voice , unable to feign indifference to them any longer . Balam Xoc 's response was immediate , showingthat he was not as unaware of their existence as he had seemed . " They are the people who have been drawn to me by the Spirit Woman . And by their own need for direction and purpose . There are many such people in the world , my daughter , though I do not think that you are one of them . " " No ? " Zac Kuk echoed doubtfully . " Do you not have your life to live ? " Balam Xoc retorted . " Is it not your own ? " " Yes , " Zac Kuk said without thinking . " Mine and my husband 's , " she added belatedly , for the sake of propriety . " He will not take it from you , " Balam Xoc told her . " And you have too much pride to give it to him . No , my child , save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving off her protest . " It is not a judgment from which you should flee . You will need your pride to make a place for yourself here . Perhaps not in the heart of your husband , but among these other people , yes , you will need it . " " I have always been told that I was too proud , " Zac Kuk admitted in a puzzled voice , but Balam Xoc merely shrugged . " Those words were meant for a girl . The pride required of a woman is a very different thing . That , you will learn as well . " Gesturing brusquely for her to accompany him , Balam Xoc turned and started out through the doorway , and Zac Kuk moved quickly to his side , pausing only to wipe the last traces of tears from her cheeks , so that no one would mistake her for a wet-eyed girl . BECAUSE the weather was good , and because so many people wished to be included as observers , the ceremony was conducted outside , on the steps inp183front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the color of the sky spirits  --  was held over the heads of the wedding couple , who were flanked by Batz Mac and Muan Kal on one side and by Pacal and Ixchel on the other . They made their vows before Nohoch Ich , who had painted his face and upper body a bright blue for the occasion , and had wrapped his hair in a turban of blue cloth . He waved a ladle of smoking copal incense over them , chanting a prayer to the ancestors , and to the spirits who brought children . Standing only a few paces away , next to Kinich Kakmoo , Chan Mac looked on with an expression of wistful pride upon his round face . He thought that Zac Kuk , his favorite sister , had never looked more radiant than at this moment , with her black hair gleaming in the sunlight and her eyes wide upon the priest before her . And his friend , Akbal , his long , cloth-wrapped head nearly touching the canopy , looking as intense and concentrated as he did with a brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have seemed a handsome couple , and Chan Mac was one who had glimpsed the depths of their beauty . For all his admiration , though , he could not deny the sense of loss he had begun to feel , almost immediately upon his arrival at the Jaguar Paw House . He had been impressed but not truly surprised by how much Akbal seemed to have matured since they had last spoken , some months before . That was to be expected , given the responsibilities Akbal had taken on , and his natural earnestness in carrying them out . He had also grown in sophistication , apparentlyfrom his contact with the pilgrims and learned men who came to visit his grandfather . What surprised Chan Mac was his realization of how much he had missed Akbal 's company . It had come to him during their first moments of greeting , when they were both spilling out their pleasure at being together again , and suddenly Akbal had looked past him , searching for Zac Kuk and smiling when he found her . That was also to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's blushing apologies . But what he had truly felt in that moment was abandoned , and while he had quickly realized the childishness of such a response , and had put a laugh upon his lips , he had still experienced the impact of the emotion like a bodily shock . He would , after all , be leaving here in a few days , and he could not expect many visits from his brother-in-law once Zac Kuk started having children . Nor did his own duties often bring him to Tikal . So there was abandonment , or at least separation , in the future . The strength of his feelings made Chan Mac wonder , as he watched the ceremony , if Akbal represented something more than just a friend . Why was it such a pleasure to watch him grow and discover his powers ? Chan Mac had two younger brothers , several half-grown nephews , and two young men who had been his proteges in the art of diplomacy . But he had never felt a comparableinterest in their growth . Was it the specialness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it have more to do with the point at which he entered my life ? It occurred to him for the first time that the reason he saw great things in Akbal was because he had ceased to expect them of himself . Perhaps I am the protege , he thought ruefully . " Yon are troubled , my friend , " Kinich Kakmoo whispered in his ear , and Chan Mac came out of his thoughts to see that the ceremony was almost over . His mother was presenting the marriage bundle to Pacal on behalf of her daughter , and smiles were spreading over the faces of the onlookers , in ant ici/ration of the celebration and feast shortly to follow . Chan Mac gave Kinich self-deprecating smile . " No , I am merely feeling envious of the new groom . " Kinich snuffled in repressing his laughter , raising his eyebrows in a leering ; clink , the conspiracy of husbands . Kinich was twenty-four , two years younger than Chan Mac , but he had been married nearly as long . " Your sister is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be grateful for the day he met you , my friend . " Chan Mac glanced at him sharply , but the look was lost in a sudden ommotion , as the crowd around and behind them let out exultant cries and vent forward to congratulate the members of the wedding party . The two men eld back , lingering together outside the circle of well-wishers around Akbal end Zac Kuk . " You will be staying for the feast ? " Chan Mac asked casually , deciding that Kinich had offered the compliment without thinking , and probably did not recall the circumstances under which he and Akbal had met . Kinich looked lown at the plastered surface of the plaza , scuffing at it with one sandaled foot . " For a while , " he said with a shrug . " There are few here , beyond yourself , vith whom I would care to spend time . " " But I thought that you and Akbal had resolved your disagreement , " Chan Vlac said in surprise . " We have . But this is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ' acorn of Tikal . " Chan Mac stared at him with sympathy , but knew better than to speak it cloud . Kinich would not want his pity , and it would not be right for Chan Mac , stranger , to take his side in a clan matter . " I will be glad to get out into the field again , anyway , " Kinich continued rufliy , as if impatient with his own complaining . " There is little pleasure in being a warchief in the palace . They think I should be content to parade my nen through villages and hunting camps , for the benefit of nervous farmers . - luh ! The Macaws will be better company . At least they want to fight ! " Chan Mac did not have to ask who " they " were , guessing that Kinich meant he higher-ranking warchiefs or the ruler 's administrators . He had seen for himself how ambitious young men were tamed by their elders , who let them near out their ambition in trivial tasks . Like being made to paint a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac reflected biterly , beginning to understand , finally , why he had been so drawn to Akbalin Yaxchilan . " Do you ever feel , Kinich , " he asked suddenly , " that you have reached the place where your success should be , but you still can not put your hands on it ? " Kinich drew a long , snuffling breath , his eyes wide with recognition . " Yes . " " Does it make you feel old , and envious of those whose success still seemsto be ahead of them ? " " It makes me angry , " Kinich said emphatically . " It makes me want to leave his place , and go somewhere where bravery is still appreciated ! " " I had not thought of that , " Chan Mac admitted in a chastened tone , as if truck by the idea.  | " But where is there to go ? " Kinich went on , oblivious of his friend 's musing reply . " I will fight beside the Yaxchilanis , but I do not respect them enough to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the place where I should raise my children . " " Yes , " Chan Mac agreed absently . " But if you feel thwarted here ? " " Ah , it is not as bad as that , " Kinich scoffed , finding his own arguments persuasive as his anger departed . " It is mostly my grandfather who thwarts me , and he can not have that many years left to him . I will yet have the respect I am due . But come , my friend , " he said with renewed heartiness , " let us find some balche to drink . It was rude of me to burden you with my problems . " " Not at all , " Chan Mac assured him , with a sincerity he did not have to feign . He was tempted to thank Kinich for his advice , but he knew that the gesture would only confound him . I can explain later , Chan Mac told himself , after I have met the grandfather , this man Balam Xoc , and have heard his vision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been laid out at the four corners of the upper plaza , and here the guests gathered to fill their gourds with cacao or balche or fruit juice , and to tear pieces off the haunches of venison and whole turkeys that had been roasted on spits . There were also fresh greens and ripe red tomatoes , baskets of avocados , sapotes , and papayas , and thick , juicy slices of pineapple and watermelon . But more than anything else , there was maize : maize of many different colors , ground and cooked in every conceivable fashion : spiced with chilies and sweetened with honey and vanilla , mixed in stews with meat or fish , rolled and baked into cakes , and even whipped together with cacao and water to form a thick , nourishing drink . Maize , the first food of the ancestors , and now the symbol of the recent harvest , and Tikal 's return to . prosperity . Akbal and Zac Kuk ate only sparingly , from each other 's hands , as prescribed by tradition . They preferred to spend their time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new freedom to touch one another , and hold hands , and stare into each other 's eyes . When the torches were lit , as much to keep off insects as to provide light , they got up and joined the other married couples in the center of the plaza , and began to dance . Here again , they made a striking pair : Zac Kuk trim and graceful in her wedding dress of yellow and white , moving lightly to the rapid pulse of the drums , while Akbal did a long-legged prance beside her , substituting enthusiasm for grace . Batz Mac , who was quite a good dancer despite his girth , teased his new son-in-law as they passed in line , reminding him with a laugh of the " heron among frogs . " Between dances , they circulated among the guests , trailed by servants who gathered in the gifts they were given . Some of the gifts were as small as the feathered charms meant to insure many children , but others were quite costly , like the necklace of orange shell beads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ha to hang around her neck . Even Akbal did not know all of the people who pressed gifts upon them , yet he thanked each of them graciously , asking even the commoners their names and the places from which they came . Dizzied by all the names and faces , Zac Kuk quickly decided that her hushand'scourtesy was excessive , and contented herself with remembering onlyp186the names of those important enough to merit recollection . She recognized these as much by their ability to return her smile as by their dress , though she dutifully smiled at all who came before her . All except one , that is . The man who thrust himself into their path just as they were returning to the dance made her clutch at Akbal 's arm , her mouth working soundlessly . He might once have been muscular , but all the flesh had been melted from his body , so that his ribs and collarbone stood out like plates beneath the taut covering of his skin . He wore his greasy hair loose upon his shoulders , carrying his head cocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other eye glared at Akbal with unknown intent , but so fiercely that Zac Kuk gripped Akbal 's arm more tightly , surprised that he had not adopted a more defensive stance himself . But Akbal merely stretched out a hand to accept the gift the man was silently holding out to him . " That is for the grandson of Balam Xoc , " the man said , in a voice so harsh it seemed almost a snarl . In Akbal 's open palm , he had deposited a single stone , slightly rounded and half the length of a finger , which shone faintly in the torchlight . Akbal stared at it for a moment , then closed his fingers around it and looked back at the man . " What is your name ? " he asked , holding his fist out in front of him , as if weighing the stone inside . " Hok , " the man said from deep in his throat . He pointed a bony finger at Akbal 's fist . " That belonged to my father , in Quirigua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad manners , and was beginning to grow impatient with Akbal 's prolonged consideration of what seemed to her an absurd gift . She did not want to be rude herself , but it occurred to her that perhaps Akbal was simply perplexed by this deranged man , and needed her help . " I have relatives in Quirigua , " she put in politely . " What is your clan ? " The man turned his glaring eye briefly upon her , turning his whole body to do so . Then he shifted his attention back to Akbal , aggressively expectant . " I have no clan , " he muttered defiantly . " Except that of Balam Xoc ... " " That is my clan , and that of my wife , " Akbal said in a warning tone , aware that Zac Kuk was regarding him with equal expectancy , and with real anger at the way she had been rebuffed . He inclined his head in her direction , hooding his eyes slightly , as if asking her to be tolerant . Then he opened the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupped loosely in his long fingers . " There is spirit in this stone , and warmth . You should not give away an inheritance such as this . " " I can not use it ! " the man shouted raggedly , tossing his head with a grimace that revealed the pale immobility of his other eye . He was breathing heavily , the tendons standing out on his neck like cords . " You have eyes , " he said in a low , sullen voice , " you are the Painter . You must have it . " " I am grateful , then , " Akbal replied , letting his hand fall to his side . " You must come to me , Hok , if there is ever a favor I can do for you . " The man gave a desultory shrug , his glaring eye dimmed by the curtain of hair fallen across his face . Then he turned abruptly and disappeared into the crowd . " He did not deserve your politeness , my husband , " Zac Kuk said tightly ,  |p187her  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's departure . " He was taunting you ! " " I do not think so , " Akbal said quietly . " I doubt that he knows another way to act . " He showed her the stone in his hand . " This is a polishing stone , used for rubbing pottery after it has been painted . They are usually kept within the families of painters and handed down from father to son , or mother to daugh-ter . " " Then you were not only pretending to admire it ? " " Such stones are rare and have properties of their own , though I am told that they come to acquire the qualities of their owners over time . I could feel the spirit of the man who used this last , and he was not at all like the man we saw . I do not know what has happened to Hok , but he is right . This stone is useless to him , though not only because of his eyesight . " Zac Kuk squinted at him , puzzled by all this talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew . " Surely , you will not use it ? " " I would dishonor his father 's spirit if I did not , " Akbal told her firmly . " I would be wasting his inheritance a second time . I think Hok meant for me to save what he could not . " " But , " Zac Kuk began , then gave up with a sigh . " I do not have any experience with such people . He frightened me . " " I am sorry , " Akbal said soothingly , putting an arm around her shoulders for comfort . " You must be given some time to accustom yourself to Grandfather'sfollowers . I am sure they are as confusing to you as the women of Ektun were to me . " Zac Kuk smiled and leaned against his chest , ignoring the beckoning gesturesof the dancers , who had gone on without them . " We will see about that , " she murmured suggestively , and Akbal laughed aloud , before leading her back into the crowd , to begin the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAN MAC had only just joined the circle of men when Balam Xoc drew him into the conversation , asking him his opinion of the campaign being planned against the Macaws . Taking a puff on the long cigar in his hand , Chan Mac glanced around at the faces of his listeners , noting some uneasiness on those of his father and the priest , Nohoch Ich . Across from him , Pacal raised a cup of balche to his lips , his face streaked with sweat , though the night had cooled . " The ruler of our city , Zotz Mac , feels the need to prove himself in the field , " Chan Mac said in a neutral tone , unable to read the expression on Balam Xoc 's face but already aware of his attitude toward warfare . " And the Macaws , in their raids , have come closer to lands under our protection . It is necessary to put a limit upon their encroachments . " " Do you think they will soon be a threat to Tikal ? " Balam Xoc asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke . " That is most unlikely , my lord , " he said tactfully . " We expect to drive them back to their own lands , which lie far to the north of us . " " Ah ! " Ilalam Xoc exclaimed , as if he had been enlightened . lie looked over at Pacal . " Perhaps it is some other people , then , " he said pointedly , " who arep188making our allies so nervous . Perhaps they will not be reassured at all , if we send our army off after the Macaws . " Pacal refilled his cup from a nearby gourd , staring at an invisible spot in the center of the circle . Chan Mac felt an immediate pang of guilt , realizing that Balam Xoc was using him to taunt his son . Nor was he through , turning back to Chan Mac with the same blank expression on his lined face . " But the spoils will be great , will they not ? " he inquired . " Surely , Zotz Mac does not do this only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons my son has stated , " Batz Mac interjected stiffly . " We are on friendly terms with many of the people who have suffered at the hands of the Macaws . We would not add to their suffering by looting . " " Forgive me , my friend , " Balam Xoc apologized hastily . " I did not mean to imply that you would . I am only repeating what has been said by those who advocate the campaign here . " Again , Balam Xoc looked at his son , and this time Pacal met his gaze , his eyes bloodshot but hot with anger . Then he looked away and made a disgusted sound in his throat , knocking over his cup as he rose unsteadily to his feet and stalked out of the room . Balam Xoc watched him go in silence , merely nodding when Nohoch Ich and several of the other men also excused themselves , though with much more politeness . Chan Mac exchanged a glance with his father , who could barely conceal his discomfort and regret at having been party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions , Batz Mac , " Balam Xoc said in an unaccusatoryvoice , looking over at the two of them . " But if your own son expressed foolish beliefs , and repeated them to others as if they were the truth , would you not correct him ? " " Not in public , " Batz Mac said bluntly , without hesitation . " And not withoutrespect for his feelings as a man , no matter what I might feel about his beliefs . " " You are fortunate , Chan Mac , " Balam Xoc told the younger man . " I do not have your father 's compassion and restraint . I respect only the truth . " Had it been offered as a boast , Chan Mac would have found the statement enormously offensive , an insult to his father 's respect for the truth . But Balam Xoc had put it forth as a simple fact , as if acknowledging a limitation he had perceived in himself , though without much regret . " I am a diplomat , my lord , " Chan Mac said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to express the same truth . " " And as many ways to deny it , " Balam Xoc replied . " Often it is impossible to distinguish them . That is why men have always sought to communicate with the spirits of the ancestors , to learn the truths that can not be denied . " " But any truth may be denied , " Chan Mac contended , leaning forward with his elbows on his thighs , " if it is inconvenient or dangerous to those who hold power . " " Perhaps . But it can not be suppressed , as long as it continues to describe the world in which men live . They will always find it again , in the midst of their pain and disillusionment . " " As you have , my lord ? " Chan Mac suggested , drawing an anxious glance from his father , who felt that the question verged on rudeness , seeming bothp189skeptical and overly inquisitive . But Chan Mac was staring intently at Balam Xoc , and did not even notice his father 's concern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balam Xoc admitted freely . " I hid from the things that might trouble my heart and mind . That was the truth I learned in my first vision : that we can not hide from our responsibilities any longer , pretending to go about our duties like good men . We can not speak diplomatically to those who would lead us to our destruction . Do you not agree , Chan Mac ? " Chan Mac caught himself on the verge of voicing an emphatic yes , as Kinich had earlier , but such an easy acquiescence to the reasoning of another went against all his training , so he merely nodded instead . He looked down at the cold cigar in his hand , and then at his father , hesitant about the announcement he wished to make . " Was it you , my lord , " he said to Balam Xoc , " who sent Akbal to Yaxchi-lan ? " " It was his father , and the ruler . I merely gave my consent . " Chan Mac nodded again , then sighed , aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well , " he asked quietly , " to visit with you , afterI have come to live in Tikal ? " " My son ! " Batz Mac cried out in disbelief . " You have said nothing of this to me ! Forgive me , Balam Xoc , " he said to their host , " but I must remind my son of his prospects . You have worked hard , Chan , and the post you have waited for will soon be open . " " There is already a post open in the embassy here . It was offered to me before I left Ektun . " " I remember , " Batz Mac assured him , " but you gave me no indication then that you planned to accept it . You seemed still intent upon the post in Copan . What has happened to change your thinking ? " " I became aware of what my waiting has cost me . I no longer looked forward to a challenge , but only to what I thought was due me . " Chan Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was comfortable with my duties , and felt responsible for little else . " " But you would be responsible for a great deal in Copan ! " Batz Mac protested . " It is a higher post than you would occupy here , and the ambassador is closer to retirement . Consider your career , my son , and the effect on your family . It is not wise to change your life on an impulse . " " Perhaps it is necessary , " Chan Mac said stubbornly , though he laid a comforting hand on his father 's arm . " And I have friends here , Father , and a sister . It is a future that excites me , as Copan no longer does . " Batz Mac let his shoulders slump and hung his head , spreading his chins upon his chest . Chan Mac appealed with his eyes to Balam Xoc , who was regarding them with his usual lack of expression . He nodded to Chan Mac , though , with what the younger man understood as sympathy . " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said to Batz Mac . " I am a witness to that fact . Perhaps that will persuade you to visit here more often in the future . " " Perhaps , " Batz Mac said glumly , but raised his head and looked at each of them in turn , lingering on ( ' han Mac 's face . " You are old enough to knowp190what is best for you , my son , " he added in a resigned tone . " I hope you have chosen correctly . " " I have chosen , at least , " Chan Mac murmured , glancing past his father at Balam Xoc . " I will bear the responsibility for that ... " THE WOMEN of the house gathered to dress the bride in a private room at one end of Kinich Kakmoo 's house . They brought bowls of warm water and clean cotton towels to wash her body , as well as pieces of jewelry and articles of clothing and an array of their favorite face paints , scented ointments , and hair colorings . A fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adding the smell of pine resin to the other perfumes in the air , and torches set into niches in the walls cast a bright , yellow light over the smiling faces of the women . For although the dressing was a kind of initiation , a ceremony of acceptance as important in its own way as the one conducted earlier in the day , it was not an occasion that called for solemnity . They were not there to intimidate the new wife but to meet her , and to show her the support they would lend her in the future . By custom , the mother-in-law of the bride should have presided over the gathering . But while Ixchel had played the role during the wedding ceremony , she had neither the age nor the confidence to take charge now . Nor did Kinich 's wife , May , nor Nohoch Ich 's wife , Haleu , and Cab Coh 's wife , Pek , was sick and unable to come . Thus , there was no one to oppose Muan Kal when she arrived with three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing . Kanan Naab had gone to bring Box Ek , and when she parted the curtain and helped the old woman up the last step and into the brightly lit room , she was surprised at the silence that greeted their appearance . Only one voice was speaking , and that belonged to Muan Kal , who stood at the far end of the room with her back to the doorway . She was talking to Zac Kuk and holding up garments for her approval , completely ignoring the women who stood or squatted behind her , listening with sullen impassivity . Box Ek let herself be led to within a few feet of Muan Kal 's back , then stopped to gather her breath . She stood silently , hunched over her walking stick , measuring Muan Kal 's inattention with her mere presence . Kanan Naab saw that the woman 's servants had noticed their entrance , and that Zac Kuk herself , half unrobed , was trying to signal her mother with her eyes . But Muan Kal remained impervious to distraction , commenting on the sheerness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . She had not won many friends for herself already that day , Kanan Naab knew , having observed her generally haughty behavior toward the servants and those below her in rank , and her open distaste for the followers of Balam Xoc . She had asked continually why this or that member of the Sky Clan had not been invited to the feast , pointing out her own relationship to the person in question and seeming not to comprehend the coldness of the replies she received . Kanan Naab had finally begun to feel sorry for her , realizing that Zac Kuk , out of loyalty to Akhal , had not passed along his warnings about the relations between the Tikal clans . Box Ek suddenly rapped her wooden stick on the stone floor , bringing Muan Kal around in a whirl of surprise.  | " You are in the way , Muan Kal , " the old woman said , straining against the stiffness in her neck to look Muan Kal in the face . " Forgive me , my lady , " Muan Kal said in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching . " " We are all watching , " Box Ek said pointedly . " It is the custom here , Muan Kal , for the women of the clan to wash and dress the new wife on her wedding night . It is very similar to what the women of the Turtleshell Clan did for me when I came to Ektun , and what they no doubt did for you when you married Batz Mac . " " The customs of the Moon Clan allowed the mother of the bride to be present , as well , " Muan Kal insisted , not moving out of the way . " My mother helped to dress me . " " You may be present if you wish , " Box Ek told her firmly , " but you do not have the right to exclude the rest of us . " Zac Kuk came to her mother 's side , holding her shift loosely over her breasts . " Perhaps you should leave me , Mother , " she suggested softly . " These women are my people now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The women in the back murmured approvingly and began to move closer , picking up their bowls and jars and implements . Muan Kal 's face quivered , and she appeared about to weep , but Box Ek again rapped her stick on the floor and hobbled forward to take the taller woman 's arm . " This is no time for sadness or regret , " she said commandingly , though it was she who was holding on for support . " Come , my lady , and sit with me , and enjoy this with us . We have no desire to exclude you from our company . " The women closest at hand nodded vigorously in agreement and also came to Muan Kal 's side , guiding her and Box Ek to seats on the bench against the wall . Ixchel sat down beside them to nurse her baby , providing Muan Kal with an immediate distraction from her embarrassment , and a reason for not meetingthe eyes of the other women . Though none of them had forgiven her for her arrogant behavior , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overlook their grievance than to bear the discomfort and bad luck of having driven her away . After seeing that Box Ek was comfortably settled , Kanan Naab joined the group around Zac Kuk , who was in the process of being undressed . Kanan Naab took a seat with the other unmarried women , who had left a circle of space around Zac Kuk and the married women who attended her . These women took turns with one another , so that there were never so many as to make the bride feel crowded , yet always enough to let her feel sheltered in her nakedness . As they laid aside Zac Kuk 's garments and began to wash her limbs with soft sponges , they maintained a continual light patter of conversation , half banter and half compliment . " Such smooth skin ... " " Ah , sixteen . . . life has not touched you yet , my daughter . " " It will soon ! " " Do not mind her , she has been touched too often ... " Zac Kuk smiled shyly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face , refusing to settle for long . This was the moment of trial , Kanan Naab realized with nervous empathy , the moment when you were permitted nop192modesty , and had to stand naked before the women with whom you would live . Yet even the shyness of her stance could not conceal the ripeness of Zac Kuk 's body , which was firm and supple , exuding a provocative kind of grace . Her breasts were taut and dark-nippled above a flat belly and hips that had not spread from childbearing . As she stood half-turned in the hands of the women washing her , her arched back and rounded buttocks forming a single curving line , her smile gradually began to lose its shyness in the awareness of how she was being admired . Now she seemed truly alluring , and while the compliments continued , Kanan Naab saw several of the women purse their lips and exchangeglances . However much they may come to accept her , Kanan Naab thought shrewdly , they will always watch her around their men . " Akbal may still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with mock resignation , " but I doubt that he will ever stare at any of us again . " Zac Kuk lowered her eyes at their laughter , though her pleasure showed through the display of modesty , which did not seem altogether authentic to Kanan Naab . Akbal had told her that the children of Ektun often bathed or swam together in the many pools and rivers near their city , and that sometimes whole families went in together . Kanan Naab guessed that standing naked in front of other people was not as new an experience for Zac Kuk as she pretended , but that she knew better than to seem too bold . Kanan Naab pursed her own lips , grudgingly impressed by her sister-in-law 's composure , which allowed her to feign a shyness that would have been all too natural to Kanan Naab , were she to find herself in the same situation . " Not too dry there , " Haleu instructed the woman drying Zac Kuk 's thighs and pubic area . " A certain slipperiness is desirable . " " Most desirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch you there , my daughter ; let him think he must find his own way in . " " But do not hesitate to help him if he gets lost ! " " If you value your own pleasure , " another woman put in more seriously , " you must say one thing to him , very clearly , at the very beginning : the word slowly ' ... " " If he hears that , he has no passion . " " Haste is not always passion , my lady . Why should he not give you pleasure while having his own ? " Kanan Naab blushed and murmured along with the other young women , unwilling to admit how uneasy this kind of talk made her feel . She knew what men and women did together , and she had touched herself as the woman said , and had learned the pleasure it could bring . But it seemed such a private pleasure , so totally within herself , that she could not conceive of wanting a man to provide it for her . Nor could she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though she had forced herself to envision such a possibility on several occasions . Always , the attempt had left her feeling confused and vulnerable , and more than ever convinced that she was perverse . The women were helping Zac Kuk choose her garments now , and holding up scents to be sniffed , all the while encouraging her to be relaxed and acceptingof the experience to come . Watching Zac Kuk , Kanan Naab had the distinct impression that most of the encouragement was superfluous . She is ready , even eager , to he a wifi+ , Kanan Naah observed wistfully . She has shared something with Akbal beyond sweet words and respectful companionship , somep193glimpse of mutual possibility , perhaps , which pulled them toward a future together . Kanan Naab was not certain why this was so apparent to her , or if she were merely projecting the feeling that had come through so strongly in her conversations with her brother . It did not seem to matter , since it was so undeniable in either case . After much goodnatured discussion , a thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It fell just to her knees and was embroidered with red roses at the hem and neckline . Then the women had Zac Kuk sit while they took out their pots , brushes , and mirrors and began to make up her face , reddening her finely shaped lips and putting a single spot of color on each of her high cheekbones . It was decided unanimously that her wide , thickly lashed eyes needed no improvement , though her eyebrows were darkened slightly with powdered charcoal . As the final touch , the intoxicating scent of wild orchids  --  pressed from the tiny brown flowers that grew in the deep forest  --  was daubed onto the hollows of her throat and along her bare arms . Perhaps the greatest amount of time , though , was spent on her hair , which was loosened from its coils and combed with turtleshell combs until it was smooth and lustrous , falling to the middle of Zac Kuk 's back . Though it would finally be left in this fashion  --  pinned back from her face with carved pieces of bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole range of local hair styles and colorings . Zac Kuk listened attentively , asking questionswith an interest that seemed far more genuine than her earlier modesty . She is not new to this , either , Kanan Naab thought , recalling what Akbal had told her about Zac Kuk 's life in Ektun , where the eligible young women were so much the focus of attention and where so much time was spent on enhancing their beauty . He had tried to make her see that vanity was regarded differently in Ektun , and that Zac Kuk should not be judged by Tikal standards . He had seemed anxious to fend off criticisms of her seriousness in advance , as if perhaps he had had some doubts of his own . Ah , my brother , Kanan Naab reflected ruefully , how little you understand about the interests of women , and the meaning vanity has for them . How little we understand , she accused herself , since she had trusted Akbal 's judgment and had accepted his worries as valid . She had come prepared for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vain , a frivolous girl unworthy of their respect . Muan Kal 's condescending behavior had only seemed to strengthen the possibility , encouraging Kanan Naab 's fantasies of having to come to her sister-in-law 's rescue . In fact , far from needing defense , Zac Kuk had totally captivated her audience , impressing them with the quality of her taste and flattering them with her enthusiasm for what they had to teach her . Kanan Naab fingered the tiny cloth bundle in her lap , feeling an ambivalence that had not been with her when she had gone to her mother 's chest earlier in the evening . She had been possessed by her own generosity then , imagining a dramatic moment in which she would sweep away all the ill feelings Zac Kuk had aroused with a single gesture of acceptance , leaving her sister-in-law overwhelmed with gratitude . Now she saw that such a gesture was not necessary , and might even be interpreted as self-serving . Kanan Naab could not deny the satisfaction she had taken in imagining Zac Kuk as pathetic and in need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to her brother , solidifying the bond that Balam Xoc had created between them . The women had finally finished with Zac Kuk 's hair , leaving its central part  --  an Ektun mannerism  --  out of deference for the bride 's taste , though Zac Kuk had shown her willingness to let them change it . She was now admiring the various pieces of jewelry the women had brought for her to wear , seeming to find each more beautiful than the last . Kanan Naab drew in her breath when Zac Kuk selected a pair of short amber studs for her ears , the gift of Haleu . The piece Kanan Naab had brought , still concealed in her lap , was also amber , and would complement the earplugs nicely . Yet she hesitated to bring it forth , fearing not only that it might be misunderstood , but worse , that Zac Kuk might choose to reject it . " They are all so beautiful , " Zac Kuk said helplessly , spreading her hands wide over the array of necklaces , bracelets , and pins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their choices , and in the midst of responding to their recommendations , Zac Kuk suddenly looked straight at Kanan Naab , lingeringon her face for just an instant before casting a significant glance at the jewelry . Kanan Naab realized that the choice was being offered to her , and that the offer had not been extended out of indecision . Zac Kuk was eminently capable of choosing her own jewelry , but perhaps she was afraid of offending those whose offerings she refused . Or perhaps she wanted Kanan Naab 's gesture of acceptance , even if she did not need it . Without a word , Kanan Naab opened the cloth and placed the necklace on the mat in front of Zac Kuk . It was a slender disc of almost translucent amber , strung on a fine fiber cord of the same yellowish-brown color . Incised in the center of the disc was the T-shaped Ik sign , the sign of the Wind Spirit , as well as the given name of Kanan Naab 's mother . " It is perfect , " Zac Kuk said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the women behind her could tie the cord around her neck . The disc seemed to glow against her reddish-brown skin , the deeply etched Ik sign standing out clearly in its center . " I am grateful , my sister , " Zac Kuk said to Kanan Naab , too moved to put on her customary smile , though all the other women were smiling with satisfaction . It was a moment much like the one Kanan Naab had imagined , though without the taint of superiority implicit in her fantasy , which made it much , much better . She smiled at Zac Kuk with gratitude of her own , feeling that her generosity had been rescued from the motives that had inspired it . " It is my brother 's night to be grateful , " she said quietly , and rose with the others to lead Zac Kuk from the room . IN THE COURSE of his waiting , Akbal had examined everything in the room many times over , each time beginning with the glowing fire in the corner , where Zac Kuk 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would sweep his eyes to the left , over the collection of wedding gifts that lay within the fire 's wavering circle of light : the heavy , three-legged grinding stone , ribbed and shaped like the back of a turtle , with its oblong grinder of the same hard , coarse-grained stone ; the bundled slats and cords of a loom ; wooden storage chests piled high with blankets and clothing ; pottery howlsp195and jars of every size and description , some plain red-ware and others paint ( in gleaming colors . The people of his clan had been extremely generous to hin inspired , no doubt , by the great bounty of the harvest , which had put the whocity into an extravagant mood . What could the women be doing so long ? he wondered impatiently , as h gaze swept past the two curtained doorways that connected this room with tY one in front . He was sitting on the soft cushion of reed mats and cotta blankets that would be their bed , so that he had only to turn his head to s ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The thick roll embroidered cloth held all of the items prescribed by tradition : pieces of jac and shell and eccentrically shaped flint , obsidian bladelets and strips of whil paper , sticky balls of rubber and copal , packets of salt and maize , and a long sharp piece of stingray spine , delicately incised with funerary glyphs . Akb : stared briefly at the stingray spine , remembering the lintels of Yaxchilan an the scenes of ritual bloodletting that had so fascinated Kanan Naab . Thoug he had found the symbolism powerful , he was just as glad that the liter mingling of blood was not a requirement of the marriage customs of Tikal. was enough to honor the tradition in spirit , and leave the actual sheddingblood to the priests and holy men . The firelight suddenly flickered , and then Zac Kuk was beside him , kneelin on the bedding . For a long moment , they could only stare at each other paralyzed by the yearnings they had carried inside themselves for so man months . Finally , Zac Kuk cast a meaningful glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhead from their view . " Perhaps we need a storm , " she suggested , her eyes bright with amusement and Akbal rose to his knees to face her , reaching out to touch the pieces c bone in her hair and the amber disc around her throat . " You were beautiful that day , as well , " he murmured as she came willingl into his arms , enveloping him in a warm cloud of orchid-scented air . All th waiting vanished from his mind , along with the advice of his clansmen and hi own , awkward imaginings of how he must act with his wife . There was n , awkwardness in the way their bodies sought one another , and no calculatioi in the matching of flesh to flesh . They fell together onto the bedding , Zac Kuk ' shift sliding up to her hips as she moved against him , her thighs opening t his searching fingers . " Slowly , my husband , " she whispered , drawing in her breath as he foum the dampness at her center and probed gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register on her face as he continued his patient strok ing . His loincloth had come loose , and it fell away completely as she reaches out to return his caresses , smiling at the way he hardened to her touch Holding his gaze with her own , she let her hands move over his body , blindl ; following the contours of bone and muscle beneath the smooth heat of his skin Only when he lifted the shift off over her head did she turn her eyes away , am then only for an instant before again finding his face in the soft red glow o the fire . " Touch me , " she urged , their faces very close , his hand once again between her legs . " Make me ready for you . " Wetness blossomed around Akhal 's fingers as he slid them between th puckered folds of flesh , feeling her nipples against his chest and the warm rustp196of her breath upon his shoulder . Their murmurings faded into incoherence , punctuated by sudden exclamations of surprise or delight . Akbal blinked deliriously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then freed him as she rolled over onto her knees , tossing her hair onto her back . He rose onto his knees behind her , angling his long torso as he pressed up against her buttocks . He waved stiffly in the air for a moment , until her hand found him and guided him to the opening , which parted grudgingly , resisting his entrance . Slowly , he remembered dimly , hearing cries and moans that were lost in the vibrations spiraling through his body , already trembling on the brink of release . There was a sudden give that made his braced arms quiver , and then he was fully immersed , enfolded , plunging yet held fast . He seemed to be rocking back and forth , though he had no sense of willing the movement , no sense of anything except the great rush of pleasure in his loins . The firelight blurred redly at the edges of his vision , then flared yellow behind his eyes as the liquid burst out of him in long , shuddering spurts , and he heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls of the room . They slowly disentangled themselves and collapsed on the bedding , their breath coming in gasps . They lay curled in each other 's arms , blinking upward into the darkness until stillness finally returned to their bodies . Akbal eased himself away from her and rose up on one elbow , looking at her with an amazement that seemed to defy expression . Clearly visible in the space between them was the proof of her virginity , an indelible track of dark spots upon the white top-covering of the bedding . " I had thought . . . " he said awkwardly . " That is , the men said that the first time is often not the best ... " " Have I given you cause for disagreement ? " Zac Kuk purred , and he laughed aloud . " I would deny it utterly ! They also said that it is sometimes hard for the woman . And painful . " " Some of the women told me this , as well , " Zac Kuk confessed . " But there was so little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pay it any notice . I did not expect it to be difficult . " Akbal laughed again , proudly . Then he grew more serious . " And how have you found the people of my clan ? " " Our clan , " she corrected him gently . " After the warning you gave me in Ektun , I did not know what to expect here . I still do not know what to expect from those you call your grandfather 's followers . But it is not all gloom and suspicion here , as you led me to believe . " " I did not mean to exaggerate , " Akbal apologized . " But there are tensions within the clan , within my own family , that were not visible today . " " Did you think there were none in Ektun ? " Zac Kuk suggested with a trace of asperity , then smiled and put a hand on his chest . " I do not think I will lack for friends here , my husband . You need not have worried on my account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which your people seem to know too little . " " What is that ? " Akbal asked defensively , and Zac Kuk laughed , putting her other hand on his hip and bringing her lips close to his ear . " Pleasure , " she whispered , and moved expertly into his embrace , resuming the task of his enlightenment.
