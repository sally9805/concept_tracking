As the tax-cut drama unfolds in Congress , a pivotal role belongs to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski . It is a rich bit of casting : for the next few weeks , an old-style Chicago ward heeler will be the nation 's premier **27;7119;TOOLONG philosopher . <P> Rostenkowski , 53 , known widely as " Danny , " is a member of an endangered species : a dyed-in-the-polyester Cook County pol trained by late Mayor Richard J. Daley to put party before everything . Rostenkowski learned his lesson well . He once impressed House Democrat Richard Gephardt of Missouri by following up some legislative support he had promised with a simple note : " I keep my word . Dan . " Says Chicago political analyst Don Rose of Rostenkowski : " He is not an ideological politician . He is Mr. Practicality . " <P> Discipline and loyalty have been Mr. Practicality 's watchwords . Born in Chicago in 1928 , he was educated at St. John 's Military Academy in Delafield , Wis. , served in the infantry in Korea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player who was once invited by Connie Mack to try out for the Philadelphia Athletics , Rostenkowski reluctantly obeyed his father , a Chicago alderman , and entered politics instead . <P> He became a committeeman in his father 's ward ( a post he still holds ) , caught Mayor Daley 's eye and , at 24 , became the youngest member of the Illinois House . At 30 , he was elected to the U.S. House , where he has remained for eleven terms- although as a member of the Capitol 's Tuesday-Thursday Club , he spends four days a week on average back home. * His wife and four children have not moved to Washington , and he estimates he has spent only nine weekends there . <P> Not much inclined to author legislation , Rostenkowski over the years has built a reputation on the Hill as likable , earnest , cautious , and absolutely trustworthy . Among the show horses of Congress , he is a workhorse . Rostenkowski was close to his goal of becoming Speaker when the 1968 Democratic Convention intervened . Lyndon Johnson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago 's streets , phoned Rostenkowski from Texas and told him to take charge . Rostenkowski did , but only after snatching the gavel away from embarrassed Majority Leader Carl Albert . Two years later , Albert , then Speaker , vetoed Rostenkowski 's nomination as majority whip . Rostenkowsi 's golf buddy Tip O'Neill of Massachusetts got the nod instead and went on to become Speaker . Last November the whip 's position was again within Rostenkowski 's reach , but O'Neill needed a staunch loyalist to chair Ways and Means . Though a stranger to the fine points of the tax code , Mayor Daley 's man characteristically acquiesced to the wishes of his party . <P> Rostenkowski has thrown himself into the new job , impressing colleagues with his diligence . If he performs well in the tax fight , he could once again have a shot at the Speaker 's role . But considering his distaste for Chicago Mayor Jane Byrne , Rostenkowski may redirect his ambitions . Says Analyst Rose : " Any Chicago politician understands a basic truth , that being Mayor of Chicago is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the House . " <P>
