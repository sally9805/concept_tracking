No hypothetical creatures of physics appeal to the imagination quite as vividly as black holes  --  those insatiable gravitational maws that gobble up everything within reach , not even allowing light to escape . Now it seems more likely than ever that one of these bizarre celestial objects is lurking at the center of the Milky Way galaxy , the island of stars inhabited by the sun and the earth . <P> In a paper published this month in the British journal Nature , six astronomers reported that they had made the most precise measurement yet of an object at the galactic center within Sgr A* , which for two decades has been known to be radiating large amounts of energy . The size and shape of Sgr A* , and its energetic output , says Caltech Astronomer Kwok-yung Lo , are strong evidence that " there may be a black hole in the center of our galaxy " devouring matter at a rapid rate . <P> To make their measurements , the astronomers used radio telescopes , which can peer through the clouds of interstellar dust that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telescopes . Still , the enigmatic source of radiation was an enormous distance away  --  30,000 light-years , or 180 quadrillion miles . The only way to discern its size and shape accurately was to employ a technique called VLBI ( very long baseline interferometry ) . In 1983 the astronomers observed Sgr A* with six giant dish-shaped radio telescopes , one each in Massachusetts , West Virginia and Texas , and three in California . " In effect , the configuration of the telescopes gave us a ' lens ' 3,000 miles in diameter , " explains Astronomer Mark Reid of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge , Mass . <P> After months of painstaking measurements , some of the mystery was stripped from Sgr A* . It proved to be shaped like an ellipsoid no more than 1.9 billion miles long and almost a billion miles wide  --  impressive by earthly standards but diminutive on a galactic scale and in relation to the tremendous amount of energy it emits . Concludes Astronomer Donald Backer of the University of California , Berkeley : " What we observe is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small by stellar dimensions . Yet it 's radiating a lot of luminosity . There are many stellar objects in the galaxy that radiate this amount of energy , but this one is peculiar . None of the others are as compact or as steady . " In other words , it behaves like a black hole . <P> Scientists have suspected since the early 1970s that a black hole might be the source of the intense radiation emanating from the galactic center . They speculate that when the galaxy was young , so much material ( in the form of stars , dust and gas ) collected at its center that it collapsed under the force of its own gravity . Crushing together until all of its mass was concentrated in an incredibly small volume , the matter continued to exert tremendous gravitational force . Like the Cheshire cat in Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland that vanished , leaving only a smile , the great mass of galactic material in effect disappeared . Only its gravity remained , continuing to pull in nearby stars and dust .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
