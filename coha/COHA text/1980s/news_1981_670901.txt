After a month of examining one of the Government ' s largest bureaucracies , Mr. Block said that the deep budget cuts proposed by President Reagan would not hinder American farmers in any painful way , and , in fact , should lead to higher farm profits. // The 45-year-old Mr. Block , who until becoming Agriculture Secretary was raising more than 6 , 000 hogs each year on his 3 , 000-acre holdings in Illinois , is also optimistic about new farm legislation governing a wide range of programs . Current legislation expires Oct. 1 and Mr. Block expects a new bill to be passed by Congress this summer without any major difficulties. // // Cuts in ' Social ' Programs // Discussing the President ' s budget proposals during an interview , Mr. Block said that , although the Administration hoped to reduce next year ' s Agriculture Department spending and lending by more than $6. 5 billion in the 1982 fiscal year , most of these cuts would come in the department ' s " social " programs - food stamps , school lunches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are not planning to loan as much for purchases of land , and the interest rates charged will be higher , much closer to the cost of private money , " Mr. Block said , adding that this would affect Farmers Home Administration loans and cause some hardship for young farmers. // In addition , he said the Reagan cuts would curtail low-interest loans by the Rural Electrification Administration , which operates farmer electrical power cooperatives . Although the effect of budget cutting in this area would not be felt for several years , he said , farmers might ultimately be forced to tap the private market at a much higher interest expense. // But he said the biggest problem American farmers faced now , as they have for the past year , was inflation and the worst of that , for them , was high interest rates . <> <> Spur in Investments Expected // " The Reagan economic plan is to cut Federal spending and this will help cut Federal borrowing and reduce the competition for available loan money , " he said . " We ' d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These , along with the tax cuts and investment credits will spur farmer investments in equipment and machinery. " // As for farm legislation , Mr. Block said the Administration ' s proposals for a new farm law would be ready by the middle of March . He said he expected the biggest change to be in the dairy price support law , which , he said , was now stimulating overproduction and costing the Government nearly $2 billion a year. // Last week Mr. Block asked Congress to eliminate the April 1 adjustment in these dairy price supports . This would yield a budget saving of about $138 million this year. // Mr. Block said he favored a plan to give the Agriculture Secretary more discretion in setting the level of milk supports tied to the rate of production instead of having to set them at 80 percent of parity and adjust them twice yearly . Parity is the 1914-based index that attempts to reflect farmers ' operating and production costs. // Mr. Block said he leaned , at the moment , toward giving the Agriculture Secretary the option of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parity if supports were tied to the level of production . This formula could check the twice-yearly rise in consumer milk prices , he added. // He said he wanted a simpler bill this time , one that would continue the farmer-held grain reserve , but with higher " call " price levels that would allow farmers to keep grain in the reserve until market prices were higher . This , in turn , would enable farmers to wait for higher prices before such grain would have to be removed from the reserve. // " I ' d also press for a modest increase in price-support loan levels , probably in the nature of l0 percent , " he said . This was necessary to combat inflation , but would not push the floor under grain and cotton prices up to current market levels and few farmers would have to use the loan program , he said. // Mr. Block said he believed farmers would see " some increase in net income this year . " In that sense , he said , farmers would contribute to food inflation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " are the inflationary pressures on the costs of fuel , transporation and labor , which are all added on after food leaves the farm . That ' s what we have to control . " <> <> Much More Optimism // Aside from some worry over the weather and continuing concern over high interest rates , American farmers were approaching the new growing season in very good shape , the Agriculture Secretary said. // " I think agriculture is coming in this spring with a much greater feeling of optimism than it had a year ago , " he added . " Last April I had never seen the farm community as depressed " // There are pockets of drought throughout the country , but few of these are as yet damaging winter-planted crops . " I think we will have an excellent wheat crop coming on , " he said . " And certainly none of the other basic crops are lost at this point . If spring grains are timed we ' ll see good yields there too. " // Farmers ' prices for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase had probably been " eaten up " by inflation , he continued . " But the fact that they are higher makes people feel better , " he said . " The livestock industry is on the upswing , although cattle prices are not yet what they should be , and prices for hogs are not as high as predicted in December . But I think those farmers are also fairly optimistic about the future. " //
