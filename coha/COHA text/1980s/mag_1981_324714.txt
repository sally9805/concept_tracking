Brooklyn nurses a baby beluga <P> At birth it weighed 140 lbs . and measured 5 ft. 3 in. from snout to tail . Name : Nyci ( pronounced Nicky ) , an acronym for " New York City 's first . " The big , blubbery infant is a beluga whale , and if it survives , it will be the first of these small , white , toothed marine mammals from the icy waters near the Arctic Circle successfully bred and born in captivity . <P> The birth occurred last month in a 50,000-gal. tank at the New York Aquarium , just off the boardwalk at Brooklyn 's Coney Island . Both parents are performing belugas that regularly entertain visitors with such antics as retrieving objects and bussing their keepers . Because of their intelligence , size and docility , belugas ( their name means white in Russian ) have long been a favorite of aquariums and aquatic shows . At least three other baby belugas have been born in captivity , but none survived longer than a few weeks . <P> Nyci 's parents have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mock bites at the newborn calf , and had to be put in a separate pen . The mother showed no desire to feed her firstborn . Nyci downs two quarts of a formula-milk , heavy cream , casein , Lactaid and vitamins-piped daily into her stomach by keepers who have to swim out after her and pull her to the side of the pool for a feeding . <P> Scientists know almost nothing about raising young belugas-when , for example , to wean the calf and begin giving it a regular diet of mackerel and herring . <P> Aquarium Director George Ruggieri , a marine biologist and Jesuit priest , acknowledges that he and his colleagues will need a lot of help , heavenly and otherwise , to ensure Nyci 's survival .
