Q  --  Are gazanias suitable for a border planting ? Do they bloom all summer ? Please give any other information you can about these plants . A  --  The single , daisy-like flowers of gazanias are ideal for borders that get full sun . With little care , the colorful flowers , which close on cloudy days and at night , will bloom all summer until frost . Once plants are established , they will tolerate dry conditions , heat and humidity , and will require less watering than other plants . All gazanias make good low border or edging plants , with varieties ranging 6 to 12 inches in height . Of special interest this year is Mini-Star Tangerine gazania , a 1985 All-America winner , which grows just 8 inches tall and is a new , rich tangerine-orange color . Other hybrids are available in red , yellow and bronze , as well as in bicolors . These native South African flowers are tender perennials in frost-free areas , but are treated as annuals in our climate . Transplants are generally available at garden centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from seed sown outdoors after frost or sown indoors for earlier blooms . Seeds , including those of Mini-Star Tangerine , can be obtained through most seed catalogues . Q  --  Last fall a friend gave me a large bulb of a " Voodoo lily " from which a thick shoot has begun to grow even though the bulb was not potted . Is this unusual ? A  --  Large bulbs of this odd plant , which is also called sacred Lily of India and Devil ' s Tongue , often begin their growth cycle in late February or March even without benefit of soil . Pot your bulb up promptly and soon it will produce a large , calla-like flower with an unpleasant odor . When weather warms up , place the plant in a sheltered part of the garden and it will develop into an interesting 4- or 5-foot plant with a thick , spotted stem and handsome , fan-like foliage . Botanically the plant is known as Hydrosme rivieri . Q  --  I saved the tubers from last summer ' s tuberous begonias . When should they be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since begonias can not be planted outdoors until after there is no risk of frost ( about mid-May ) , they need not be started indoors until late in March . This will give them sufficient time to develop into sturdy plants . The plants grow rapidly and if started too early they tend to become weak and spindly under most home conditions before they can be moved to the garden . Q  --  What causes buds on hyacinths and tulips that were forced for indoor bloom to wither before they open ? A  --  This is usually due to exposing the plants to too much warmth after they have been taken out of cold storage . They should be grown for a week or so at about 65 degrees , where the light is not too bright , then given warmer temperatures to open their buds . Soil should never be allowed to become totally dry . Q  --  Please list some shrubs and trees that would attract birds to our garden . A  --  Almost all berry or fruiting varieties provide food that will attract birds . Among shrubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spicebush , yews , barberry , honeysuckle , buddleia and multiflora roses . Trees include mountain ash , the hawthorns , mulberry and flowering crabapples . Q  --  What kinds of plants are butterworts ? I am curious about them . A  --  The butterworts ( Pinguicula ) are curious insectivorous plants like the Venus flytraps , and usually are grown in terrariums because they require a mossy , moist environment . Depending on the variety , the tiny flowers , borne on 6- to 12-inch leafless stalks , may be white , purple or yellow . The tops of the basal leaves have a sticky secretion that " catches " small insects such as gnats and mosquitoes . They are grown from seeds or root divisions .
