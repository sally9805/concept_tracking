It was n't until the 17th century that the law recognized that you could assault a person with a weapon called words . Until then only physical blows entitled the victim to a remedy . Concepts of honor and reputation were cher  --  ished long before , but they were supposed to be vindicated by vio  --  lence . Duels on the field of honor , not in the courts , were the forum for satisfaction . Of all the remedies the law has fashioned to redress grievances , the libel law ranks among the noblest . It provides a judicial means to salvage a person 's dig  --  nity , to recapture the esteem in which he has been held by the com  --  community , to restore the victim to his profession and business and to his family and friends . In addition , the libel law provides for a triple-tiered damage structure : actual money loss suffered from loss of job or business or professional activity ; recompense for pain , suffering and humiliation ; and , if the libel was motivated by malice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others from similar misdeeds . Indeed , libel can also be a crime . The effect of in  --  flanunatory words can be so severe that it causes riots . Interestingly enough  --  under the common law and still in many states  --  even truthful words can constitute a crime if they are maliciously de  --  signed to arouse passions which cause violence . Why not ? Much less , such as loud music all night , or sound tracks blaring at un  --  earthly hours , has been held to con  --  stitute criminal nuisance . Despite the philosophers , truth does n't justify everything . It , too , must ac  --  commodate itself to the peace and safety of the community . Here we begin to see the impending clash between the libel laws and free speech , which I shall discuss later . Although libel laws do not dis tinguish between a minor hurt and a serious one , I have always felt that it was good discretion not to launch a suit for every lie uttered . The highest estate which a lawyer can reach is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise adviser . Not every grievance should result in a lawsuit . In a crowded com  --  petitive world , people will step on each other 's toes literally and figuratively . But we ought not to rush into court every time we have been jostled or an angry cussword has been spoken . Legal warfare is expensive and harrowing . It should be resorted to only when there is real damage , not merely high sen  --  sitivity to a slur . The exception , of course , is when an important principle is involved . Then the damage is subtle . It may not injure the individual , but he becomes the vehicle through which the rights of many may be as  --  serted . Sometimes the reputation of the person maligned is so firm that it is impervious to libel . Nevertheless , the target , though unscathed , may recover punitive damages . Most often , however , the griev  --  ance is narrow . It affects one in  --  dividual and no one else . The air is filled with vituperative gossip . Col  --  umnists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tele  --  vision . So in desperation for items , columnists pick up rumors , hear  --  say and even invented " informa  --  tion " cloaked in anonymity ? " What famous Hollywood star has left his home and board because of a redheaded starlet who has a minor part in his new picture ? " I discovered on one occasion that the author of the titillating item had no more idea of the answer than did the reader . This procedure is encouraged because reporters consider their sources to be sacrosanct . Unless there is a state statute which gives the same immunity to a reporter as to a doctor , priest or lawyer , such privilege does not exist . There is much to be said for the protection of newspapermen by means of such laws , because the serious reporter might not be able to obtain infor  --  mation if , later , he could be forced to reveal his source . However , the unwritten law of silence , which has caused reporters to martyr them  --  selves and go to jail rather than speak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always thus ? Every law is like a disc  --  recorded on two sides . The virtuous purpose is stated on one side , but , if we ex  --  amine the platter on the other side , dissonances appear . The libel disc has two sides , too . One , the idealistic judicial tool to avenge in  --  jury to reputation by civilized means , the other the use of such tool to attack for every petty , in  --  consequential slight . As a lawyer , I have been engaged in lengthy court battles of the first genre , but on the other hand , I have probably discouraged and prevented more libel . suits than most lawyers . Let me give several illustrations . Truman Capote , he of the talented pen and gossipy tongue , made dis  --  paraging remarks about the writ  --  ing ability of Jacqueline Susann , the author of Valley of the Dolls , Once Is Not Enough , The Love Machine and Dolores . ( Capote in sists that all artistic writing is gossip , citing War and Peace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on a contrived definition of history as accumu  --  lated gossip . ) Capote 's comments about Susann were made on Johnny Carson 's " Tonight Show , " thus assuring an audience of millions for his contemptuous views . Opinions are not generally subject to libel . They may be wrong , but not untruthful . They express the critic 's frame of mind accurately , and the reader knows that he is receiving an evaluation , not a statement of fact . If , how  --  ever , a critic writes that an actor 's performance was defective because he was drunk , and he was not , that would be libelous  --  indeed , as the law says , libelous per se because the libel demeans one in his profes  --  sional capacity . There is the anec  --  dote of Heywood Broun 's review of a play in which he stated that the star gave the worst performance ever seen in a theater . He was sued for libel . A year later , while the suit was pending , the same actor ap  --  peared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to write anything which would aggra  --  vate the situation . He reconciled his critical integrity with his law  --  yers ' admonition by writing about the star whom he had previously impaled that " his performance was not up to his usual standard . " Although Capote 's less than en  --  thusiastic view about Susann 's ar  --  tistry was not libelous , the battle of words was on . Carson , like any interviewer , was not averse to con  --  troversy and he invited Susann on his program . She was ready . When asked whether she had heard Capote 's comment , she surprised everyone by doing a remarkable takeoff of him . Whatever one might think of her writing , there was no doubt she was a great mimic . Capote lends himself to that art . He is very short , pudgy , puffy , baldly blond and talks in a high-pitched , nasal , slow Southern drawl which outrageously exagger  --  ates his homosexuality . He is like a cartoon of himself . It is only re  --  spect for his fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless , his rolling eyes , giggles , squeaky voice and feminine gestures pro  --  voke stifled laughter even from those most attentive to his views . Susann captured all this per  --  fectly . Despite her large size and dark visage , she shrank to his gnome-like size , and her whining cadences , interrupted by stretched out " w-e-1-1-s , " sent the audience Continued on following page into paroxysms of laughter . It is easy for an imitator to gain recog  --  nition of a subject who has one out  --  standing characteristic . Cartoon  --  ists know this well  --  De Gaulle 's long nose , Roosevelt 's onesided smile , Churchill 's bulldog nose , Nixon 's jowls , Carter 's teeth ( called Chiclets by one comedian ) . But for live imitators , the voice and the musical scale it travels are the trademarks of individuality . They are considered as distinctive as a fingerprint . A gifted mimic can achieve his effect by talking from a dark room . But his virtuosi  --  ty on the stage includes posture , subtle gestures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail . Now it was Capote 's turn . He was invited to occupy the same chair from which she had per  --  formed and give his rebuttal . His was not the skill of imitation . He was an originator , and he must have given much thought to find  --  ing just the right descriptive phrase which would ridicule her and create as much laughter as she had subjected him to . When Car  --  son asked him what he thought of Susann 's views , he raised his voice to its shrillest pitch and declared that he paid no attention to her . " A-n-y way , she looks like a truck driver in drag ! " Words are like chemicals . Some combinations fizzle . Others ex  --  plode . The laughter which burst across the nation drove her and Ir  --  ving Mansfield , her husband and gifted partner in the dissemination of her works , right into my office . They insisted on an immediate suit . I advised them that in my opinion a slander had been commit  --  ted . Aside from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed the animus of the words . What is an innuendo ? It is the law 's device to spell out the in  --  tended vicious meaning of what might otherwise appear to be inno  --  cent . So , for example , if one writes , sarcastically , " Oh , sure , he is an honest man , " one can sue for slan  --  der if spoken , or libel if written , and plead the innuendo that such words meant that he was dishon  --  est . So , the innuendos to be as  --  cribed to " A-n-y way , she looks like a truck driver in drag " were many . One was that she was a lesbian of masculine inclinations , or that she was so unfeminine that she was more like a man who , because of perversity , dressed up as a woman , or that she was as ugly as an un  --  couth truck driver who aberration-ally disguised himself in woman 's clothes  --  all clearly slanderous . I recognized the anguish the words had caused her , her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been made a laughing-stock particularly in those quarters where envy is the by-product of success . We are hero-worshippers , but paradoxically , we like to see the mighty fall . It levels us , creating the illusion that we have risen somewhat , rather than those we looked up to have de  --  scended . That is why we cheer the champion and yet thrill at his defeat . So , although Capote 's comment was in my opinion libelous ( tele  --  vision broadcasts have been held equivalent to written publications and therefore libel rather than slander ) , and although I was not unaware of the hurt and humilia  --  tion they had suffered , I advised against suit . It seemed to me that what was involved was an unfortu  --  nate exchange not worthy of the fees , exhaustion of time in ex  --  tended pretrial depositions , ulti  --  mate lengthy trial and probable ap  --  peals . Furthermore , there would be no actual damage . Was n't she still on the best-seller list ? Did she real  --  ly believe Capote 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw no principle in  --  volved . Also , there had been some provocation , which in law is deemed to ameliorate damages . All this fell on unsympathetic ears . We are blind to what we do not want to see and deaf to what we do not like to hear . They were determined to attack . Fees were of no consequence . She was fabu  --  lously successful . She wanted revenge . She want  --  ed to see the day when " the little worm would squirm under cross-examination . " I was losing the battle of persuasion rapidly . In the course of the friendly argument  --  ment , I learned that they were leaving for Germany to attend a book fair in which her book was fea  --  tured . I seized the opportu  --  nity to gain time . " You are leaving in a few days . A complaint can not be prepared in such a short period . Why do n't you wait until you return ? We 'll con  --  fer again . Perhaps you will view this differently by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the first time , their tense demeanor changed and they smiled . " You are not going to talk us out of this , " Susann said . " We 'll be back , " she announced with Mac  --  Arthur determination . " We expect you to prepare papers . Please , please , we want you to sue the nasty little --  . " She used a heavenly phrase not intended to be angelic . Their visit to the book fair in Frankfurt was a triumph . Her books were featured . She was honored . International recognition is particularly gratifying to an author . It gives the impression of historic appreciation . When she and her husband sat again in my office , she was glowing with pride , and he reflected hers as well as his own . Her description ofher trip set a different stage for the discussion . There was no longer single-minded insistence prompted by desperation . I redoubled my effort to have her drop the matter . By this time , rec  --  ollection of the ridicule to which she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public at large , her increas  --  ing invitations to appear on forums and television interviews , her hus  --  band 's prideful citation of the phenomenal sale of her books , the inescapable jealousy such success produces , including possibly Capote 's ( this pleased her most ) , the protective callus an author must develop against the inevi  --  table blows from critics , an experi  --  ence not unknown to her ( unan  --  imous praise is almost impossible ) , and therefore she ought to rise above the taunt in a television ex  --  change . I felt it was my duty to protect her against an improvident litigation , but if she disagreed I knew there were many able lawyers who would undertake the matter . They insisted that they would only proceed with me , and resignedly , though good-naturedly , the matter was closed . So we thought . But we counted without Capote 's penchant for gossip and pursuit . A short time later , the following appeared in a publication called After Dark : " It was Capote who took advan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at another highly vulnerable ' writer , ' Jac  --  queline Susann . On the ' Tonight Show , ' he told the world that she looked ' like a truck driver in drag . ' " It did n't take long for Miss Susann , who is n't exactly a novice at verbal self-defense , to announce she was suing Capote for a million dollars . " ' Had to drop the whole suit , ' Capote says , chuckling with vic  --  torious pride . ' Had to ! She and her lawyer , the famous Louis Nizer , went to NBC to watch a replay of the program which they watched and watched , and finally , Louis Nizer turned and said , " Jackie , forget it . You do n't have a case . " She went into a rage and screamed , " A case ? Whad  --  dya mean ? It 's right there in living color . Libel if there ever was libel ! " And then Nizer told her that all my attorney would have to do was to get a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parade into court and that would be all . So , no million-dollar suit from Miss Jacqueline Susann . ' " Immediately thereafter , and as surely as inventive venom begets retaliation , I received a brief note from Susann . Dear Louis Now the little ' capon ' has put words in your mouth  --  it 's really wild ! What do you think ? Best , Jackie The restrained tone of this note was undoubtedly due to her belief that she now had an ally . She knew that Capote , by repeating and en  --  larging the libel , and fictitiously drawing me into the suit to confirm him , had made it difficult for me to plead with her to be forgiving . Her previous gesture of forbearance had resulted in a gloating rep  --  etition of the attack on her . I would have to act . She was right . I sent this letter to Capote . My Dear Truman Capote : In the May issue of After Dark you are quoted as describing my re  --  jection of Jacqueline Susann 's re  --  quest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there was an invulnerable defense : our view  --  ing the broadcast at NBC , etc . Every statement attributed to you is incorrect . I did not advise her and her husband that she had no cause of action against you . On the contrary , I thought you had libeled her . I did not view the broadcast . It was not necessary . The reason I persuaded her not to sue was that it is my policy to discourage libel suits unless there is very serious injury to the plain  --  tiff and his or her career , or an im  --  portant principle is involved ( as in the Frank or Reynolds-Pegler case ) . There is always hurt to sensi  --  bility , but not every injury , at least in my judgment , warrants a legal war . I had hoped that my judgment in dissuading a suit would be justi  --  fied by letting the matter die with only the sacrifice of hurt feelings . However , you have chosen to re  --  vive the matter , claiming to know of the confidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  senting completely false reason for your not being sued , and one which incomprehensibly has me confirm  --  ing your libelous statement . Thus you involve me , too . In addition you give further evidence of malice toward Jacqueline Susann . I may have to reconsider my de  --  cision to discourage litigation even though there was a cause of action . My decision may well depend on your reply . In all fairness , I would expect and appreciate a prompt correction of the matter . Sincerely yours , Louis Nizer Truman Capote answered with characteristic verve and wit . He flattered me by saying that he found it impossible not to answer a charming letter from a lawyer even though the burden of the communi  --  cation was to sue him . But the point of the letter , all said in good humor , was that he did not see how he might have libeled Miss Jacqueline Susann . He re  --  marked that in the give-and-take of interview language he had com  --  mented , off the cuff , that she bore a striking resemblance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This he felt was " bitchy , yes ; malicious , no . " He was of the attitude of one professional to another with admiration for what she did in her field of literary endeavor , although he reserved judgment on the virtue of the field itself . He then turned his attention to the fact that Miss Susann had made some remarks about him in West Coast interviews that might be reviewed . She had repeatedly referred to him as a homosexual , which accusation he turned off with the comment , " Big news . " He felt that she had also accused him of sloth and that she suggested that he was green with envy of her energy . This accusation seemed to bother him not at all . That he was unhappy about the quantity of her output compared to his he found totally without merit ; as far as he was concerned she could win the world 's major literary prize and it would not disturb him . Once again he thanked me for such a delightful , scolding letter and pointed out that correspon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might keep his letter for my heirs to sell at some far later date at a literary auction . It was the kind of letter that brightens one 's day , and suddenly , by his magical writing ability and disarming candor , he had removed the heat from the whole situation . Susann was completely appeased by this disarming letter . She had received an apology , been told that he respected her " as a very profes  --  sional person , " had conceded that his comment about her was " bitchy " and confirmed her charge that he was homosexual by chiding her that she had hardly made a new discovery . She laughed about the whole thing and might even have been charmed by his wit . But the real reason known to few , that she now saw the matter in better perspective , was that she had been advised that she had cancer and had only one year to live . If we would sense the immi  --  nence of death one year or 20 , would not most quarrels subside ? Mr. Nizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September issue of the Post .
