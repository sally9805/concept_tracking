NORTHERN IRELAND Without Mercy Death at a disco <P> The Razzmatazz disco in the small village of Ballykelly was no classy night spot . For about $2.50 a head , it offered British soldiers a rare chance to get together with local girls and escape the tense conditions of Northern Ireland . Gathering each week for dancing , the beer-drinking customers of the disco 's Droppin Well bar and the gyrating couples on the dance floor took little account of the dangers of Ulster terrorism . Last week they paid the price . A small bomb , possibly smuggled into the disco in a handbag , exploded , collapsing the heavy concrete-slab roof on 150 revelers inside . <P> The Irish National Liberation Army ( I.N.L.A. ) , a Marxist offshoot of the outlawed I.R.A . with allegedly close ties to Eastern Europe , claimed credit for the blast , one of the worst incidents in the province since the current bombing campaign was launched more than a decade ago. * The result was hardly creditworthy . " It was carnage , " said one rescuer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the local pharmacist : " Bodies were strewn all around , and injured survivors , some with ghastly wounds , staggered about in a state of shock . " Others told of carrying out victims who had lost limbs , while doctors from Londonderry , 14 miles to the northeast , worked frantically to save the most mutilated . The grisly toll : eleven soldiers and five civilians dead and 70 people injured , some seriously . <P> The blast , part of a crescendo of new violence in Ulster , provoked a furious reaction . In Ulster 's recently formed assembly , which is still being boycotted by Roman Catholic parties , the mood among Protestants was grim . " We want to see the men responsible for this evil deed exterminated , " said one . " I do n't care whether they are hanged by the neck , judicially executed or shot against the wall . " Catholics were also outraged . " I rise not simply in anger but also sick to the stomach at this act of barbaric cruelty , " said Oliver Napier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nowhere was the outrage louder than in London . Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons that " this slaughter of innocent people is the product of evil and depraved minds an act of callous and brutal men . " Northern Ireland Secretary of State James Prior , who visited the scene , called it " a massacre without mercy ... one of the most cold-blooded acts of savagery ever carried out in Northern Ireland . " Though the I.N.L.A. apparently receives little aid from North America , a conservative M.P . seized the occasion to denounce the " collection of funds for the I.R.A . " in the U.S.
