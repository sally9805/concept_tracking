Anyone who wanted to buy the toy company Selchow &; Righter in 1984 would have paid an outsize price , like $200 million or so . At that time the company was hotter than hot , thanks to the board game it manufactures , Trivial Pursuit . But last week , when the company finally agreed to be sold , it went for a much smaller price : $75 million . The firm 's acquirer : Coleco , the company that manufactures another smash hit , Cabbage Patch dolls . <P> Selchow 's value has fallen because Trivial Pursuit proved to be a fad . The manufacturer 's annual sales of the game plunged from $400 million two years ago to roughly $50 million now , estimates Paul Valentine , a toy-industry analyst . In contrast , Coleco 's Cabbage Patch annual sales rose 11% last year , to $600 million .
