But while many artists of the last 25 years , from Robert Rauschenberg to Sherrie Levine , have worked in several mediums during their careers , almost all museums and many galleries continue to separate their production according to the traditional categories of painting , sculpture , printmaking , drawing and photography . This is a pity , since it obscures the often complementary concerns of an artist ' s output , and makes assessing its overall message more difficult. // Luckily , there are exceptions to this prevailing tendency . The traveling exhibition " Lucas Samaras : Objects and Subjects , 1969-1986 , " now at the Smithsonian ' s National Museum of American Art , is such an exception . Samaras ' s creations seem intended to defy categorization , ranging as they do from nonfunctional chairs made out of wire coat hangers to color photographs that have been sliced apart and recombined to form panoramas of the artist ' s apartment . Although his last museum show in New York ( in 1984 ) consisted entirely of Polaroid photographs , any attempt to survey the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispense with medium-based categories. // Samaras is an extreme example of the contemporary tendency to play in many fields of expression at once . The exhibition includes his paintings , sculpture , photographs and drawings , as well as installations and objects that combine Surrealist incongruity with kitsch . He seems unable to leave even the most ordinary object alone . A spaghetti strainer from the kitchen is intertwined into one of the coat-hanger chairs ; above it are miniature models of skeletons , the couple from a wedding cake , and a bouquet of artificial flowers . His boxes are encrusted with painted stones and fake jewels . He even adds his hand to his photographs , pushing the colors out of the shapes that contain them , and painting dots on otherwise blank walls. // The riotous multiplicity of means he uses is not inconsequential , nor is it accidental . " For Samaras , to be modern means to be hybrid : to recognize that there is no privileged style or medium among the many that constitute the affluence of modern art , " the critic Donald Kuspit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalogue of the show , which originated at the Denver Museum of Art last spring . Like Chuck Close , David Hockney and other artists of his generation , Samaras has been led by this denial of hierarchies to a long and inspired involvement with photography . But more important , he has been led to the creation of images and objects of great invention. // By starting in 1969 , 10 years after Samaras ' s first show in New York , the exhibition fails to include such evidence of his seminal work as " Room 1 " ( 1964 ) , a gallery installation that duplicated his bedroom down to the bedstead and mattress , and a 1960 painting that is studded with razor blades . But the 200 or so works in the show do provide an ample experience of his sensibility . On display in roughly the order in which they were made are examples of his enigmatic sculptures using the form of a common chair , two room-size environments , acrylic paintings on canvas , drawings in pastel , various series and sizes of Polaroid photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decorative , encrusted boxes that he began making in 1962. // What keeps this concatenation of visual objects from seeming like a monument to artistic vacillation is the strength and intensity of Samaras ' presence in each of them . Whether it is a box faced with silver straight pins , yarn and kitchen knives ( " Box 94 , " 1976 ) , or a Polaroid portrait of a naked man hunched in a chair , in which the artist appears as a kind of spectral presence in the background ( " Sitting 8 x 10 , " 1978 ) , the relationship between the artist and his audience is brought into high relief . This is especially clear in the works that conclude the show : grotesque paintings of skull-like heads , presented in series of from 1 to 12 panels , which bear the titles " The Art Dealers , " " The Art Critics , " " The Artists " and " The Spectators. " // These , and almost all the works in the show , have an obsessive quality that focuses attention on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to suggest that " like all romantic art , Samaras ' art rests on the borderline between sanity and insanity . " The photographs , especially , tread the Freudian territory ; many are self-portraits in which the artist , nude , contorts his face and body to create a threatening , animistic alter ego . Partly self-absorbed acting out and partly a calculated affront to good taste , these pictures seem intent on reducing the gap between the artist and his audience , while at the same time making us keep our distance . One has to fight to keep from being put off by the art , and by the artist. // But however much Samaras ' work seems to be generated by the artist ' s inner necessities , the exhibition helps make clear that it is nonetheless a product of its time . His " Rooms " and " Corridors " date from a period when environments and installations were all the rage ; his first involvement with photography was simultaneous with a growing interest in the medium as an alternative to painting and sculpture ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Decoration painting . While it would be unjust to suggest that the artist merely reacted to these tendencies , it is fair to say that his way of working is not entirely divorced from the reality of contemporary art . One wonders , in this regard , whether some of the most recent work in the show - cast bronze sculpture combining furniture and small figures , and the expressionistic , Munch-like paintings of dealers , critics and artists - isn ' t indicative of a return to the very mediums that 60 ' s artists rebelled against. // Samaras ' work not only abounds in contradictions like those between attraction and repulsion , and compulsion and calculation , it thrives on them . There is the conflict , made literal in his " Boxes , " between openness and closure . His chairs veer between the familiar and the fetishistic ; the sewn fabric " Reconstructions " ( which , of all of the artist ' s work , seem the most like conventional paintings , even though they are not ) combine form and decoration. // He transforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image or object . In the same way , since he always draws directly from his surroundings and the circumstances of his Greek childhood , he manages to contract the traditional separation between the materials of art and the materials of life. // This contraction is , in one sense , a legacy of the 60 ' s , and it is ultimately what gives unity to the various mediums and methods that he practices . But it also accounts in large part for the feeling of dissatisfaction one acquires by the end of the show. // Apart from a few big , ambitious pieces - his mirror-lined " Corridor 2 " ( 1970 ) , the large fabric " Reconstructions " ( 1977-79 ) , and a bronze table on which a Brueghelesque host of figures disport ( " Sculpture Table , " 1981 ) - the work here sounds mostly minor chords . This is not necessarily bad ; the manipulated Polaroid self-portraits called Photo Transformations , done from 1973 to 1976 , are particularly vivid even in their diminutive three-inch-square format , and despite some discoloration since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most vexing is the message of the art , not the objects chosen for exhibition . Because Samaras chooses to circle his theme of self and other in a variety of ways - some of them of his own invention and some adopted from contemporary as well as primitive art - the work lacks a conventional sense of progress . His artistic " development " seems to spiral out from the center , rather than having a clear and linear vector . Certainly one could say the same about other artists - of Picasso , obviously , in painting , and of Harry Callahan in photography . But they circle issues of form , while Samaras ' psyche is in the center of his coil. // The difference is substantial . By combining his art and his life as he does , while refusing to make value judgments about the materials he uses , Samaras confronts us with an esthetic Degree Zero . We expect art to reflect on life from an elevated observation post , to be drawn from life , but not identical with it . But Samaras ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen as major or minor , it is unquestionably troubling . " Lucas Samaras : Objects and Subjects , 1969-1986 " remains at the National Museum of American Art through Oct. 16 , after which it will travel to Atlanta , Miami , Richmond and Boston .
