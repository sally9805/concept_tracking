The people who work at the Angler ' s factory are various and typical . There are third-generation Germans , second-generation Italians and first-generation Chinese and Korean immigrants . They talk about their children , their children ' s children , the weather and the robbery at the house next door . They speak their minds and mind their business and their machines . They work and go home , and eat and sleep , and go to work again , to turn out plastic stationery products in bits and pieces. // Last Friday , when the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that consumer prices had declined for the first time since 1965 , the people at Angler ' s were doing the kinds of things they do every day. // In the sewing room , they were stitching up artists ' portfolios . In the new part of the main factory building , they were putting inserts into clear plastic Valu-files for important documents . In the back , in the old part , two men were working on plastic attache cases , and some women were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorites designed to be slipped into any breast pocket to hold pens and pencils. // Some of the workers make as little as $3. 35 an hour , which is the minimum wage , and some of them make more. // On Monday , they were doing the same things , too . Most of them had not noticed the news of lower prices in the paper . None of them had noticed it in the supermarket . Some of them talked about prices , but it was old news , like talking about a grandchild already in elementary school , or a death that had happened a year up , up , " said Maria D ' Elia , while a brightly colored rendering of the Sacred Heart of Jesus looked down on the machine she runs , turning out plastic folders . " The news comes on and said the prices lower . I said where ? The eggs , $1. 19 , $1. 25 . The milk , $1. 18 . I don ' t eat too much the meat . I used to like the steak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other workbenches , one of the women was saying that she did not eat steak anymore . " I would rather buy a turkey breast and get two days out of it , " she said. // " Now listen , " said her supervisor , " there isn ' t a person in this building wouldn ' t buy themselves a piece of steak if they wanted one . I see people in Waldbaum ' s with food stamps buying steak . People spend money to go to weddings , to the beauty parlor . I was raised one way : You have a roof over your head , you have a clean dress , food in your mouth , that ' s enough. " // " If you need that little bit extra , you just don ' t have it , " said the woman , cowed . " No , " the supervisor said . " But those are the essentials. " // Some people at Angler ' s blame the government , and some people blame the new immigrants , and some people blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a lot of them like him. // His name is Gerson Strassberg , and he thinks the decline in the Consumer Price Index is not terribly meaningful . He thinks inflation is here to stay . He thinks Angler ' s is , too . In the last five years , he expanded and renovated his factory. // In 1965 , the last year that the price index declined , the company had 70 employees . Now it has 240 . The factory is more roomy , and much lighter . The executive offices , once a series of cubbyholes , are spacious and covered with carpet and material simulating wood . In Mr. Strassberg ' s office , there are a bar and imitation Tiffany lamps , amber colored . All discussions of inflationary trends come down to interest rates. // " We owe various banks $4 million , " he said . " At various times last year , we paid as much as 24 percent to the banks . I don ' t understand how those interest rates are expected to bring inflation down , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise prices. " // The venerable Cuffettes , the little plastic cuffs to protect secretarial sleeves , which were one of Angler ' s first products in 1945 , have gone from $3 in 1973 , when the oil embargo sent plastics sky-high , to $5 today. // " When you go back to 1973 and remember that gas was 30 cents a gallon and now it ' s $1. 30 , I don ' t think the average person is going to get excited if it goes to $1. 25 , " Mr. Strassberg said . " But no matter what I spend today , I know I ' m going to look back in 10 years , and it will look like a bargain. " // So that is the sunny side of the street at Angler ' s , which stretches along both sides of 162d Street in Flushing . All discussions of inflationary trends are relative . No one believes that prices are coming down . But Mr. Strassberg is happy because he has his remodeled plant , tastefully beige and brick. // Mrs. D ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it is bad for her heart . And Julia Iglesias , who is a supervisor in the sewing room , says she likes the work . " We are very lucky in this building , " she said . " We get to work a lot of overtime. " // Four years ago , a teamsters union representative spent a lot of time on the street outside Angler ' s during lunch break , trying to organize the workers . An election was held , and the union lost . Now , the representative is back , talking about hard times and low wages . A lot of the people who have been at the factory a while think the union will be voted down again. // " I ' m not starving myself or anything , " said Mrs. Iglesias , ripping a seam out of an ill-constructed Your Excellency Deluxe Presentation Binder . " I ' m just making a living . But that ' s it . You make it and then you spend it . These times , you can ' t do anything more. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
