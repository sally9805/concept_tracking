Mexican and American towns suffer from peso jitters <P> The border of Mexico and the U.S. is going through the most important crisis in the past few decades , " declared Mexican President Jos Lpez Portillo on a visit to Tijuana . If anything , that was an understatement . Last month 's devaluation of the peso created an absolute mess for businesses in both countries . On the Mexican side , supermarket shelves were stripped clean of basic necessities by Americans who found their dollars worth three times as many pesos as they were a year ago . On the American side , merchants whose lifeblood is Mexican patronage were left standing beside silent cash registers . <P> In a frantic attempt to find stopgap solutions , the government of Mexico 's outgoing President threw a one-two punch that has now transformed this confusion into surreal chaos . It issued a vague edict forbidding Americans to take home certain foods from Mexican markets , and it imposed ill-conceived currency restrictions designed to stem the tide of money flowing out of the country . The result : border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The food-export ban was issued because the government believed , with some justification , that Americans were cleaning out Mexican stores of staple foods , many of which are subsidized by the government . By setting the official exchange rate at 70 pesos to the dollar , the August devaluation sent the price of a dozen tortillas down to the equivalent of 27 ( vs. 82 on the U.S. side of the border ) and a pound of sugar to 7 ( vs. 30 ) . These items , along with eggs and meat , were among more than two dozen restricted for export . <P> Mexican customs officials are enforcing the new controls haphazardly at best . Neither shoppers nor officials seem to know how many of which items can be taken across the border , or what is supposed to happen to those caught with too much . " People just do n't know what is going on , " said Alex Harrison , a retired American buying Kahlua liqueur ( not banned ) in Jurez last week . Among the horror stories is the saga of Bob Walz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pickup truck with 250 gal . of diesel fuel in Mexico at 16 a gal . He was arrested at the border for " disrupting the economy of Mexico " and spent five nights in jail . <P> " The list is very confusing , " admits Octavio Muoz Corral , president of the Jurez Chamber of Commerce , who is futilely struggling to persuade Americans to keep buying below the border . Indeed , the uncertainty has been the main factor keeping Americans from shopping for much of anything in Mexico . " The tourists are scared away , " says Salesman Manuel Vasquez , surveying his empty marble-products shop in Jurez , which logically should be packed with Texans seeking more for their dollar . " Our business is off about 50% . Capitalism works . This type of stupid socialism doesn't. "
