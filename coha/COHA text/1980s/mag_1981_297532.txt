America 's atomic program is ailing , but Reagan wants to try to cure it <P> The nuclear industry has had its problems lately , hasn ' t it ? <P> - Robert Szalay , vice president of the Atomic Industrial Forum <P> Among atomic understatements , that one is a classic , ranking perhaps with initial descriptions of the March 1979 accident at Three Mile Island as " a normal aberration . " <P> Even before the near-disaster in Pennsylvania , the growth of nuclear power had been slowing steadily . Since then , it has been stopped cold . The share of the nation 's electricity generated by fissioning atoms has been stuck since the Pennsylvania " event " at 11.4% , nowhere near the exalted levels that had once been expected . <P> Even the current proportion may not be maintained for long . This month the Power Authority of the State of New York has shut down an operating reactor at Indian Point because of cracking and leakage in the plumbing of its steam generator ; the cities of Austin and San Antonio have developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Washington State utility combine is faced with - 'an uncontrollable termination " - that is , complete cancellation-of two reactors under construction . Surveying the ballooning cost of building nuclear plants , Merrill Lynch , the giant investment firm , coldly suggested in March that one of the best ways for utilities to improve their financial position would be to scrap 18 of the 78 reactors for which construction permits have been issued . Since then , three of the projects on the Merrill Lynch hit list have indeed been junked . <P> Now , however , nuclear power advocates have found a powerful champion dedicated to reviving the industry : Ronald Reagan . In a policy statement early this month , Reagan committed his Administration to a program to speed the construction of nuclear plants . Said the President : " One of the best potential sources of new electrical energy supplies is nuclear power . But the Federal Government has created a regulatory climate that is forcing many utilities to rule out nuclear power as a source of new generating capacity . We must remove these unnecessary obstacles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposed by Jimmy Carter in 1977 on reprocessing the uranium in spent fuel rods into plutonium , which is used in atomic bombs . That ban was supposed to help check the spread of nuclear weapons . Lifting it may in the long run help power companies get rid of some of the nuclear garbage piling up outside their plants , but its immediate impact will be small . Only one reprocessing plant now exists in the U.S. , in Barnwell County , S.C. , and it is operating as a research rather than as a commercial facility . <P> Far more important , Reagan ordered the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to speed up procedures for licensing nuclear plants , so that the time from first blueprint to the start of electricity production , which now is as long as 14 years , can be cut to six to eight years . NCR Chairman Nunzio Palladino is thinking of standardizing nuclear-plant designs . Also , Reagan ordered the Administration to work with industry on developing safe methods for the permanent disposal of nuclear wastes . The Government would like to open demonstration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
