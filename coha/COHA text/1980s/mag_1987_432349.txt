 | AIDS fund raisers have never had a season like this one . Socialites and celebrities , ambassadors and activists , politicians and publichealth officials are clamoring to help , attending AIDS benefits and writing checks . Suddenly , charity organizers ca n't find banquet halls big enough for AIDS functions . Ask one actor to appear : five call to say they 're coming . When Chicago held its first big AIDS benefit in September , more than 3,000 people forked over $150-plus for tickets to the star-studded evening . New York society has hosted a whirl of glittering AIDS events : dancing at Lincoln Center , music at Carnegie Hall , an auction at Christie 's . " People who would n't be caught dead at an AIDS benefit a few years ago are now begging to be invited , " says Elizabeth Kummerfeld , a founding director of the American Foundation for AIDS Research ( AmFAR ) , which is funded in part by these events . " AIDS has become the fashionable charity . " That has n't always been the case . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mathilde Krim , a research biologist and a founding chair of AmFAR , hosted a small AIDS fund-raiser at her home in the spring of 1983 . " It was like pulling teeth to get people to come , " recalls Krim . " In those days , people would n't shake hands with someone who had AIDS . Even a cocktail party was considered dangerous . " Krim , together with a handful of doctors , fund raisers and gay activists , set about changing the way AIDS was presented to America . " We needed public relations , " she says . " We had to have credibility ; we had to be seen as a mainstream group and not a gay organization . " A board made up of people with money and prestige would not only bring in more funds , it could go to the public with the message that AIDS was a public-health problem and not a gay disease . From the start , Krim 's line has been that it is a " fluke " that AIDS emerged in the gay community . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says . Krim , whose husband , Arthur Krim , is head of Orion Pictures , began calling friends in high places . She recruited Mary Lasker , a renowned philanthropist , as one of the foundation 's first board members . @# @# Then she began staging benefits ? a fashion show with Pauline Trigere , an evening at the Shubert Theater with Elaine May and Mike Nichols ? that would attract important donors . The night of the Shubert gala , Krim gave a speech warning the wealthy , influential audience that an unchecked AIDS epidemic " could destroy the economy of New York City . " She told them AIDS could devastate the fashion , theater and restaurant trades and that the number of AIDS deaths could be extrapolated to horrendous figures . It was strong stuff . " It was an interesting ploy , " says Larry Kramer , a cofounder of the Gay Men 's Health Crisis ( GMHC ) and author of " The Normal Heart , " a play about AIDS . " She was trying to raise money from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distanced itself from the gay community . " Heterosexual panic : Many people involved in AIDS causes believe AmFAR 's strategy was necessary at the time . Before Rock Hudson died of AIDS in October 1985 , the disease had n't caught the country 's full attention . Elizabeth Taylor had yet to join forces with AmFAR and lend the AIDS cause the allure of her name . " Everyone should 've been interested in AIDS , but it had to become ' chic ' before people could see why they should care , " says Jerry Della Femina , who created a national advertisement for condoms , " I enjoy sex , but I 'm not ready to die for it . " Says Della Femina , " It was an attempt to warn everyone . " But in recent months , AIDS fund raisers and activists have been accused of engineering a heterosexual AIDS panic that is totally disproportionate to the epidemic . In November 's Commentary , Michael A. Fumento writes : " One would never know from all this that the profile of the typical victim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regular sex partner of an i.v . drug user . " Fumento and other conservative critics charge that Krim , along with some scientists and gay activists , exaggerated the heterosexual risk in order to reduce the stigma of the " gay plague " and raise more money for research . " But they are removing the emphasis on how AIDS is actually transmitted , " says Fumento , who is an AIDS analyst for the U.S. government . " A lot of people out there are unnecessarily terrified . Instead of teaching sixth graders about condoms , our effort to control AIDS should emphasize those most at risk . Anything else is a waste , " he says , " and it could be a fatal distraction . " Inevitably , the accusations of AIDS-hyping boil down to how to interpret statistics . How serious is the risk to the general heterosexual population ? No two experts agree . But according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) in Atlanta , only 4 percent of the 48,574 known AIDS cases are attributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some estimates say , that percentage could double , putting it as high as 9 . " There has been a real rise in heterosexual transmission , " says Dr. Jeffrey Laurence , director of AIDS research ? for New York Hospital and Cornell University Medical College . The real number of AIDS cases among those who are n't in any risk group is still very small , probably only 4 in 10,000 , according to Laurence . " But the primary reason people give money to AIDS research is not because of the heterosexual concern , but because people are dying , " says Laurence . Great urgency : The issue of heterosexual AIDS is becoming incendiary as scientists on both sides compete for research dollars . AIDS researchers say their cause has great urgency : AIDS is infectious and deadly . Other scientists worry that funds vital to studying diseases that take a larger toll than AIDS are being siphoned off by the now " fashionable " AIDS virus . " What scientists have learned is that if you can work AIDS into your project , there are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , director of public information for the Cancer Research Institute . Some scientists also feel that because of the flood of new money for AIDS research , the standards for grant proposals are not as high as they should be . " They feel there is some squandering of federal funds , " says O'Donnell-Tormey . Some AIDS fund raisers fear that people are still looking for someone to blame for the AIDS epidemic . " The danger of a backlash has n't passed , " says Krim . " Every community goes through stages in reaction ; that 's why education is so important . " Judy Peabody , a prominent New York socialite , has heard friends protest , " Oh , not another AIDS benefit . " " I tell people it 's for research , or a hospice program , or a residence for homeless people with @# AIDS , " says Peabody , who has been a volunteer at GMHC for the past two years and has solicited money for many AIDS-related projects . " It 's not just another benefit . " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are many small charities , each with its own staff , legal counsel and accounting firm , that take 30 to 50 percent of every dollar just to maintain the organization . " I do n't want to point any accusing fingers , " says Kummerfeld , " but many fund raisers have latched onto AIDS as an easy cause to raise money for . You can get entertainers for free and squeeze the caterers . " Kummerfeld was outraged when an AmFAR benefit held at the Potomac restaurant in Washington , D.C. , in May wound up costing $83 a head . " The outfit that handled that party is very expensive , " says Kummerfeld . " Their livelihood is charity parties . " Short shrift : Despite the rash of AIDS fund-raisers , the money going to AIDS still represents a small fraction of what is being raised for public-health causes . In 1986 only 3 percent of all public-health grants by private foundations were specifically for AIDS programs , according to John Clinton , assistant director of the Foundation Center in New York City , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their supersensitive publicrelations departments , are even more conservative donors . " I went repeatedly to one company , " says Kummerfeld . " But the president was a bachelor , and they were afraid that a donation to an AIDS charity would raise embarrassing questions . " Last Christmas AmFAR sent out 450 letters to untapped corporations . It got just two $1,000 donations . This Christmas AmFAR is doing better . But the $8 million it has spent on research grants so far is a drop in the bucket compared with what Krim would like to see . " The government has given AIDS short shrift , " says Della Femina . " If Nancy Reagan had embraced AIDS as a cause , these people would n't have to scratch for this money . " If AIDS fund raising has earned a glitzy reputation , the behind-the-scenes reality is still grim . " The fact is that AIDS is depressing , " says Peter Glen , a retail consultant who helped organize an AIDS seminar at Carnegie Hall earlier this month . " People are now willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they still do n't want to think about it . " The bottom line , says Glen , is that " they do n't do the hard work , but at least they write checks . I NEWSWEEK : DECEMBER 28 , 1987 55
