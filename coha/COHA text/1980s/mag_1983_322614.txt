Strife be unto him who in enlightened times is fool enough to suggest that women are getting too big for their britches , but evidence abounds . There has now appeared on television The Sins of Dorian Gray , a modernized perversion of Oscar Wilde 's Picture of Dorian Gray , in which the famous senescent canvas became a filmed screen test , and Dorian was played by a woman . A remake of the 1946 movie It 's a Wonderful Life cast Mario Thomas in the role established by Jimmy Stewart and Cloris Leachman as the once male angel . Mary Tyler Moore made her Broadway debut in 1980 with Whose Life Is It Anyway ? in a part originally written for a man . Joan Rivers and Nancy Walker pressed Neil Simon to permit them to play the leads in a female rendering of The Odd Couple . <P> The mind heaves with possibilities : The Sisters Karamazov ? Twelve Angry Ladies ' ? Young Girl with a Cornet ? Mrs. Roberts ? How long before the world is treated to a revival of Moby Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Streep as the passionate yet complex crew ? Or Steven Spielberg 's E.T.T.E. ? Or Richard Attenborough 's epic film biography of the Indian pacifist Blandhi ? <P> Naturally , one is told not to worry about these things . Such transformations do but signify the newly liberated consciousness wherein the contemporary male and female are learning to exchange and fuse their too long separate and restrictive identities . Thus in the past year alone have audiences been instructed and entertained by movies like Victor/Victoria , in which a woman impersonates a man in order to impersonate a woman ; and The World According to Garp , featuring John Lithgow as the transsexual ex-pro-football player with a heart of gold ; and Tootsie , in which Dustin Hoffman , decked out as the soap-opera heroine Dorothy Michaels , both receives and delivers his revelation : " I was a better man as a woman with a woman than I 've ever been as a man with a woman . " That , of course , is the essential message in these bottles : when a man assumes the role of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied by a man , it is the man who gains immeasurably from the virtues thus acquired . <P> The cultural goal of these exchanges would seem to be the creation of an androgynous ideal , a male hero with certain indispensable facets of his masculinity intact but displaying in great and blatant measure the desirable female attributes of gentleness forbearance and sensitivity . This is not at all the menacing androgyny of a Mick Jagger , whose odd dual nature appears to find its roots in the bowels of Greek mythology . Rather , it is represented by a fellow like Alan Alda , a man 's man but wearing pastel sweaters . In fact , this heroic vision was realized long ago ( minus the pastel sweaters ) in such figures as Henry Fonda and the recently usurped Jimmy Stewart . What seems to be sought nowadays is a Californiated version of the former types , men who have achieved their " softness " specifically because of their therapeutic and ennobling association with women .               @ @ @ @ @ @
