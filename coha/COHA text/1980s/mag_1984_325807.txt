Early elections in Israel <P> As voting time drew near , the debate within the Knesset assumed the proportions of melodrama . Would one member return in time from Argentina ? Would former Prime Minister Menachem Begin , who had not been seen in public since he resigned last September , show up to cast the deciding ballot and thus bail out his successor , Yitzhak Shamir ? In the end , it did not matter : the Knesset approved the opposition Labor Party 's call for early elections , 61 to 58 . Though the bill must survive three more votes , the balloting last week all but guaranteed that voters will go to the polls between late May and November , probably in July . For the Likud coalition government of Shamir , which wanted the elections held during the deadline month of November 1985 , the decision was a stinging defeat . <P> The move has been building since the annual inflation rate approached 300% in February . It gathered steam on Monday , when the leader of the tiny Tami Party , whose three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections . The sudden about-face was partly attributed in some quarters to pressure from Nissim Gaon , a Swiss-Jewish multimillionaire and Tami benefactor . After Nigeria failed to pay him hundreds of millions of dollars for a chain of luxury hotels he was building , Gaon reportedly asked Shamir 's government to allow Israeli banks in Switzerland to give him loan guarantees . When Finance Minister Yigal Cohen-Orgad refused , Gaon urged Tami Leader Aharon Abuhatzeira to call for new elections . Gaon , who co-founded the Tami Party in 1981 , vigorously denied any interference . <P> In its nose count of Knesset votes , othe Labor Party assumed that Likud Maverick Dror Zeigerman , on a fact-finding mission to Argentina , would be absent ; if Zeigerman returned and Begin voted , the Likud would be able to defeat the bill . On Wednesday evening , however , word reached Jerusalem that Zeigerman was flying home . As the Knesset prepared to vote , photographers clustered at Ben Gurion International Airport awaiting Flight 332 with Zeigerman aboard , while another clutch of reporters stood vigil outside Begin 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Likud , but Begin never emerged . As it turned out , his presence would not have helped : another Likud member defected and gave Labor its majority . Recent polls indicate that Labor , headed by Shimon Peres , would handily defeat Shamir 's Likud bloc if voting were held now . When the election date is finally set , the campaign promises to be as fierce as any Israel has seen .
