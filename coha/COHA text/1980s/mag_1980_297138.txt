Who promises to cut and slash <P> When David Alan Stockman was asked to become Reagan 's director of the Office of Management and Budget , he accepted with alacrity . It was , after all , a chance to put into practice the budget gospel that he had been preaching during his two terms as a Congressman from southern Michigan : cut , cut and slash , slash . His boss has promised to slice 2% from the $640 billion budget for 1981 ; Stockman may push for more radical surgery . Earlier this year , he advocated abolishing federal revenue sharing with cities and states , paring back federal job programs , freezing Medicaid payments , and reducing appropriations for foreign aid , social science research and mass transit . In addition , he said he would cut the budgets of all regulatory agencies by 20% . <P> A friend says that Stockman , as Reagan 's chief budget cutter , is resigned to being the " most unpopular man in Washington for the next few years . " His manner is sometimes aloof and abrasive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly and wield them to deadly effect during debates . <P> At 34 , Stockman is the youngest Cabinet member named so far . The son of a Michigan farmer , he was an antiwar activist as an undergraduate at Michigan State University , and studied at Harvard Divinity School . A bachelor , he is a workaholic who shuns receptions and cocktail parties . <P> A born-again conservative , he tends to hold fervent and dogmatic views . He once told an interviewer : " At 20 , it sounds great to say that self-interest is the most destructive force in society . Now I believe that self-interest is an inherent part of the human condition and what we need to do is harness it , not abolish it . " He boasts of paying little attention to pressure groups , even among his own constituents . Says he : " I 'm not much of a horse trader or a head counter . I 'm more interested in ideas than votes because we ca n't make rational policy in a country this complex unless we 're guided by ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're guided by pure expediency and political pragmatism . " True to that precept , he was the only Michigan Congressman to vote against federal loan guarantees for Chrysler Corp .
