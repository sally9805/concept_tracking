In the toy and game business , yesterday 's craze is today 's closet stuffer . And no company knows that better than Coleco . Its cuddly Cabbage Patch Kids were once every small child 's dream , but sales peaked in 1985 and have been falling ever since . In 1986 Coleco made a seemingly shrewd move in buying the company that held the license to the popular Trivial Pursuit game , but soon yuppies began to grow tired of asking one another questions like " Who played the Lone Ranger 's faithful Indian companion ? " <P> Now there is big trouble in the Cabbage Patch . Citing a debt load of about $300 million , incurred mostly during years of heady expansion , the firm said last week it would lay off 35% of the managerial staff at its West Hartford , Conn. , headquarters and 50% of its production employees . But as dramatic as those steps were , Wall Street is not sure they will be enough to keep Coleco out of bankruptcy .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
