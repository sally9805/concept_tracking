THE LONELY GUY <P> The idea of mating sitcom material with a surrealist style seems , at first glance , to have about as much promise of permanent delight as a pickup in a singles bar . And by the end of The Lonely Guy , even the film 's best friends may feel that some aesthetic counseling is in order . Yet for a movie that once again takes up a matter made achingly familiar by contemporary song and story - the hardships and confusions of the single life - it offers some curiously arresting visions : the rooftops of New York City crowded with men howling the names of women whose unlisted phone numbers they have lost ; the air around the Manhattan Bridge filled with the falling bodies of suicidal lovers ; a service that rents cardboard cutouts of celebrities to fill up the room when a hopeless bachelor tries to give a party . A pity Director Arthur Hiller could not sustain such a high level of lunacy throughout this adaptation of Bruce Jay Friedman 's pop-classic meditation on how urban realities undermine our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felliniesque might now be accreting to The Lonely Guy . But half the film is merely joky in a flat , familiar way , and Steve Martin in the title role and Charles Grodin as his best friend too consistently play in the depressed-repressed mode . There needs to be some open frenzy in their madness . Still , there is more off-the-wall originality in the film than audiences can find in a dozen typical commercial comedies . It is a one-night stand one might actually remember in years to come . <P> CRACKERS <P> In the 18th century it was considered chic to spend an evening at the local lunatic asylum , laughing at the inmates . In the 20th century you can be asked to leave a dinner party for making a joke about the mentally disturbed or deficient . Perhaps the kindest thing to be said about our century is that it has managed to make this modest improvement in manners . Perhaps the kindest way to describe Crackers is to say that it is informed by the older sensibility . Louis Malle 's remake of the unfunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in translation to contemporary San Francisco , where a dismal group of losers ineptly attempt to rob the safe of a pawnbroker who is , grumpily , the only friend they have . <P> Neither touching nor humorous in their dimness , they can engender only one emotion : disgust . Donald Sutherland , Jack Warden and Wallace Shawn are among those trying to find some overtone or undertone they can resonate to , but the script is so dull and the direction so lacking in dynamics that they are reduced to aimless noodling . The depression they feel in their bereft state will quickly communicate itself to any viewer .
