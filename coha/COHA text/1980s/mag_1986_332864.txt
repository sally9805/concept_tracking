Careful readers of our American Scene section will have noticed that pieces by Gregory Jaynes appear more often than those by anyone else . This week 's story , about a musical recital in the ranching community of Choteau , Mont. , is Associate Editor Jaynes ' 44th for the section . Like many others , the idea came from one of his favorite sources , a reader . A woman from Montana wrote to TIME about a nearby piano teacher with an interesting clientele . <P> Jaynes , 38 , came to TIME in 1983 from the New York Times , where he reported on Africa out of Nairobi and also was a roving national correspondent . He recalls , " In a total of 15 years of daily journalism , I covered everything from coups and killings to a cat caught up a tree . I reached the point where I wanted a note from my doctor saying ' No more hard news for this man ! It 's bad for his heart . ' The opportunity to do American Scene was just the prescription . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain from the press . " <P> To help find them , Jaynes pores over vast quantities of newspapers and periodicals , scooping them up wherever he happens to be . At home in Atlanta , he heads for a local bookstore that carries the city 's largest assortment of out-of-town publications and buys $80 worth at a time . " The clerk is always happy to have me do it , " Jaynes says in characteristic deadpan manner . <P> Story ideas often lead Jaynes down a circuitous path . " I may go into a town to write about a mean billy goat in someone 's yard , " he says , " and end up writing about an old goat at town hall . " Such reflections come naturally to the Alabama-born Jaynes , who remains very much the Southerner . Yet his patchwork-quilt collection of pieces covers every section of the nation . Among the subjects that have piqued his interest are the loon preservationists in New Hampshire , a restaurant in Barrow , Alaska , that is the only place to find Mexican food in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sells live bait through vending machines . <P> Jaynes , who travels one week and writes the next , calculates that he has recorded enough mileage to have circumnavigated the globe nine or ten times . " I was about to say that is too much flying for anyone , " he adds . " But the truth is , I am just about to get on a plane . "
