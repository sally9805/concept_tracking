" All you ' re thinking is you ve got to hold yourself together .. <P> <P> Control . Along with cool charm , good looks and an obsessive desire to walk in her husband 's shadow , control is a buttress of Nancy Reagan 's persona . <P> That willed restraint is visible in hurly-burly crowd scenes , in interviews that usually leave reporters unsatisfied and on the rare occasions when she speaks from a platform . And the control is there just four days after the attempt on her husband 's life as she greets a correspondent in the East Wing sitting room on the second floor of the White House . The chamber has been Reaganized . There are two jars of jelly beans and a dish of bonbons . A pair of massive traditional sofas has come cross country from their former home in Pacific Palisades . <P> The First Lady 's friends say that she feels " guilty " about being * when the slug tore into Reagan 's left side . She has spent the week visiting hospital rooms-the President 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been consoling Sarah Brady , knowing that a slight change in the angle of the gun barrel could have laid Reagan as low as Jim Brady , or worse . <P> But her smile is as warm as the sunshine that engulfs the room . In a beige tweed skirt and tasteful silk blouse , with every dark blond hair in place and her huge hazel eyes clear , Nancy Reagan looks as much like spring as the tulips and hyacinths that festoon the room . And when she starts talking , the control is there . No , she had not worried much about physical assault , not any more . Reagan had been threatened frequently while Governor in Sacramento ; in 1968 a security man shot at someone trying to fire-bomb the Governor 's residence . <P> " It was the tenor of the times , " she says of that period . " But during the past campaign , and certainly since the election , the only thing we felt was such warmth and affection that fear of attack was n't up front Her restraint begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was on the third floor of the mansion , in guest quarters that are still being renovated , when a Secret Service agent told her : " There has been a shooting . The President has not been hit , but he is at the hospital . " She decided to leave immediately , even though , as she recalls it , she was told , " It is such bedlam there , so much confusion , maybe it would be better if you stayed here a while . " <P> <P> When she arrived outside the emergency room she was at first informed , by Mike Deaver , that Reagan had been wounded , but only slightly . Her worry escalated slowly . Moments later , doctors told them that it was more serious than Deaver had thought , and she saw her pale , prostrate husband . <P> What did she feel ? Fear ? Anger ? <P> " There 's an unreal kind of feeling ... It 's hard to describe . There 's an unrealness to it ...

This time she seems as interested in finding the answer as the reporter is . <P> " You 're frightened , sure , " she says finally . " Of course you 're frightened , especially because he was having trouble breathing . But it just seemed so unreal . And I guess you ... must go into a sort of a ... " <P> The thought trails off . She sighs .
