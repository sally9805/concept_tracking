A 4 million-year-old human ancestor is unearthed in Ethiopia <P> Even on its tiptoes , the little creature stood hardly more than 4 ft. tall . Its brain was no larger than a chimpanzee 's . But unlike its apish kin , it had a clearly human characteristic . It could walk upright , probably as well as modern man . Its arms gathered food , warded off foes and perhaps even made primitive tools . Yet the most remarkable thing about this tiny ape-man is its age . It lived some 4 million years ago , in what is now a forbidding corner of Africa called the Afar Triangle . If its discoverers are right , this ancient biped may be man 's oldest direct ancestor , nearly half a million years more ancient than the previous claimant to that evolutionary honor . <P> Word of the discovery came last week from British-born Anthropologist J. Desmond Clark of the University of California at Berkeley . Says he : " I think we 've got something both significant and extremely exciting . " Although paleontologists often scrap as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not disagree with Clark 's assessment . " It 's of tremendous potential , " says Berkeley 's F. Clark Howell , who has spent years fossil hunting in East Africa . Agrees Duke 's Richard Kay : " A blockbuster . " <P> The ape-man 's bones provide impressive new evidence for what was once a radical evolutionary idea : that our primitive ancestors learned to walk upright before they developed large brains . Though it could walk and probably even run on its hind legs , the Afar creature 's cranial capacity was pitifully small , totaling no more than about 400 cc , barely a fourth of the size of the brain of Homo sapiens . The meager skeleton shows no noticeable anatomical variations from the remains of another ancestor , the famed 3.6 million-year-old " Lucy , " who has been regarded until now as man 's oldest direct kin . Such evolutionary stability over some 400,000 years , argues Anthropologist Timothy White , Clark 's Berkeley colleague , must be considered strong support for the emerging view that species change , not gradually , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The history-making fossils were found last fall in the Awash River valley of the Afar desert in north-central Ethiopia , only 45 miles south of Lucy 's burial grounds . Clark 's 15-member expedition is the first scientific team to dig in the remote , fiercely inhospitable valley since the fighting between Ethiopia and Somalia began to ease three years ago . Even so , the scientists took protective measures , hiring Ethiopian game wardens and rifle-bearing Afar tribesmen who also toted knives half the size of machetes . <P> Over a period of ten days , the scientists turned up eight bone fragments from two different individuals . One , discovered last November by White , is the upper part of a left femur , or thighbone , about 6 in. long . A skilled anatomist , White was able to judge not only the was able to judge not only the creature 's height but also its sex and age : male , about 16 or 17 years old . From markings showing where the muscles were attached to the bone , he also determined that this ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
