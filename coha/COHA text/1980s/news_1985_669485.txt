' ' One day there was a whole country filled with men who knew how to carve roasts . The next day the same country was filled with men who couldn ' t carve a roast if a gun was held to their heads . Who taught our fathers ? Why didn ' t our fathers teach us ? ' ' // Mr. Greene is a Chicago-based syndicated columnist who just published his second best seller ( ' ' Cheeseburgers , ' ' Atheneum , $13. 95 ) containing such discourses on what might be called the signs of our phantasmagorical times . He compiled the collection - his seventh book - while doing his Chicago Tribune column ( carried in 200 papers and growing ) , performing regular broadcasts for ' ' ABC News Nightline , ' ' and writing a monthly column , ' ' American Beat , ' ' for Esquire magazine. // He is so curious about such diverse topics - what ' s the Alamo like in the middle of the ' 80s ? What ' s on Richard Nixon ' s mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern Airlines shuttle ? - that he goes to take a look . The surging success of what he writes after he finds out suggests that others want to take a look along with him. // // When Greene started writing his column nearly a decade ago , he made one resolution : Interested in what affects him ' ' viscerally - as a person , not necessarily a journalist ' ' - he says , ' ' I would try to tell the same story in the newspaper that I would want to tell my friends later on. . . . ' ' // One thing that sets Greene apart from other well-known syndicated columnists is that his topics cut a swath across politics , sports , family life , education , and pop culture . In doing so , they explore that gap behind the headlines and in front of statistics and demographic shifts where the true humanness , irony , and humor of America reside . What ' s it like to learn to read for the first time at age 65 ? Is an American Express platinum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you explain Topo Gigio ( the Pillsbury Doughboy-like mouse on the old ' ' Ed Sullivan Show ' ' ) to an 18-year-old ? // More than just a storyteller , Greene likes to ferret out the stories that measure the direction of an entire society . Rather than just telling you that shopping malls are the social epicenters of the ' 80s , he cavorts there with two teen-age boys for an entire day , describing their every encounter . Or he finds an obscure news item and tries to uncover its broader import. // Example : ' ' Sometimes the small news items speak more eloquently of what is going on , ' ' he wrote in one daily offering . ' ' And so it is that the most telling and symbolic story of the year is the mugging of Howdy Doody. ' ' // Now , you might not have been particularly interested in a story about Howdy Doody , but you may , based on that lead sentence , find yourself reading the next line , then the next and the next , until you ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , delighted , you begin to read another . And you find that Greene ' s treatment of such specific topics emphasizes universal concerns : home , love , fame , food , best friends , idols , change. // He often tries to assess that change by asking where we are and where we started . What happened to the old ' ' Dick and Jane ' ' books ? Whatever happened to the Viewmaster , that binocular-like device that showed pictures when you held it up to light ? Where ' s Fess Parker , the actor who played Walt Disney ' s ' ' Davy Crockett ' ' ? ( Answers : Dick and Jane were phased out in the ' 60s by pressure from women ' s and civil rights groups ; Viewmasters are still going strong with the latest 3-D rendition of Michael Jackson ' s ' ' Thriller ' ' ; Fess Parker sells mobile homes. ) // Greene ' s technique often involves asking questions about things he sees , then following up by going beyond where most journalists would stop . Traveling through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they would do to meet members of Motley Crue , the heavy-metal rock band . Listeners were invited to mail entries to the station . Greene called the station , got hold of some entries - and more than just printing them , contacted the respondents. // ' ' I would put together the most outlandish outfit made of nothing but leather straps , chains , and nails , ' ' one 19-year-old girl wrote . ' ' P.S. I would take a hammer so the guys can loosen the nails off my outfit . ' ' ' ' We seem to have come quite a distance from Herman ' s Hermits fan clubs and ' I Want to Hold Your Hand , ' ' ' Greene writes. // He writes in short , simple sentences without embellishment in a ' ' just the facts , ma ' am ' ' style . His conclusions seem non-editorial and don ' t espouse causes . Humor and poignancy are rampant , but they seem inherent in the situations he writes about , not in a stylized or contrived view of them. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things - his mother , his diary , his father ' s baby-shoe bronzing business - without exuding ego . He always manages to touch the human element in a story without waxing sentimental - an elderly couple ' s wedding , a grandmother who ' s joined the Playboy Club - in ways that derive universal import from the particular incident. // Greene is wrapping up what he calls an uneasy stint on the other side of the microphone - answering questions about how he developed his craft and why . The answers come short and staccato-style , like his prose . His shifting manner while answering questions lends credence to his observation that he is not as comfortable talking out loud as he is ' ' writing to discover what he thinks. ' ' // Why should ' ' journalists ' ' and ' ' people ' ' be interested in different things ? // ' ' They shouldn ' t be , but they are , ' ' he says . He grew up in Columbus , Ohio , and has written about his longing to get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his wife now live in downtown Chicago with their two children , but he is on the road constantly in search of material. // ' ' Unfortunately , journalists are interested usually in some canned idea of what a good story is . As a person , viscerally you ' re interested in all kinds of things . You don ' t go around trying to put stuff in little categories. ' ' // He has arrived for the last of a 19-city book tour wearing the same outfit he wore when still a journalism freshman at Northwestern University : blue , pinpoint Oxford cotton shirt , loosened tie , corduroy pants , Weejuns ( he has written about his inability to feel comfortable in anything else ) . // He says there is a reason so many people write about the same things . ' ' It seems like if there ' s a debate about the MX missile in Congress , you ' ll read 30 columns about it in the next two days - because that ' s supposed to be written . But I just don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to just wander around and see things that really hit me first and do that. ' ' // He speaks of innate sensors that tell him what a good story is , something that will ' ' touch people and speak to whatever is going on in our society . ' ' ' ' Keep it simple , ' ' ' ' Tell it like it is , ' ' ' ' No adjectives ' ' - these are other phrases that pepper his conversation . ' ' You ' ll find me in the writing , ' ' he says , pointing to stories that reveal a sensitive and thoughtful inquiry. // And he speaks of growing up in the Midwest , and being based there , as aiding his journalistic development free from the pack. // ' ' Most journalists tend to categorize their interests on Page 1 of the Wall Street Journal , the ( Washington ) Post , and the ( New York ) Times - that it ' s not news if it isn ' t there . I just don ' t agree with that. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
