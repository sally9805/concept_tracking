The British are coming , most by air , a few by sea . So are the Japanese , the French , the Germans , the Italians . Not to mention the Australians , Brazilians , Thais and Taiwanese . As the U.S. dollar lingers near its lowest post-World War II levels against such foreign currencies as the Japanese yen and the West German mark , large crowds of visitors from overseas are streaming onto U.S. shores this year , cameras and shopping lists at the ready . From California 's redwood forests to the South 's Gulf Stream waters , from Malibu to Maine , foreign tongues are echoing through all the familiar U.S. tourist attractions  --  and some of the offbeat haunts as well . <P> So debilitated is the dollar that some Europeans  --  not just the jet-set crowd , mind you  --  are dropping in on New York City just for a weekend , blitzing the stores along Manhattan 's Fifth Avenue and queuing up for Broadway shows . " We 've been to Majorca , Crete and Yugoslavia , " says one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpet fitter from Britain . " But , " he crows , " America is so cheap this year ! " <P> Crowded too . The U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration expects 11.9 million overseas visitors in 1988 , 1.4 million more than last year 's record number of arrivals . The largest contingent will come from Japan , which will send an estimated 2.8 million people , up 32% from 1987 . Next in line are 1.6 million Britons ( an 18% increase ) , 1.1 million West Germans ( 10% ) , 585,000 French ( 8% ) and 350,000 Italians ( 10% ) . The only major countries not participating in the upsurge of tourist traffic to the U.S. are Canada and Mexico . The Canadian dollar has not gained nearly as much ground against the U.S. dollar as the European and Japanese currencies have , and the peso has fallen 45% against the greenback in the past year . <P> As the summer tourism season swings into full gear after the Memorial Day weekend , U.S. hoteliers , theme-park operators , tour organizers and car-rental agencies are bracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will bring plenty of money to spread around . A Government survey done in 1986 , when the dollar was 25% stronger , showed that an overseas traveler spent an average of $1,358 ( $340 on gifts and souvenirs alone ) while in the U.S. This year visitors are expected to inject some $10.7 billion into the U.S. economy . Partly because of this infusion , revenues for the U.S. hotel and motel industry could rise to $54 billion , up 6% from 1987 . <P> The decision to book a trip to the U.S. is a matter of dollars and sense : it is now as cheap for Europeans and Asians to head to America as it is for them to vacation much closer to home . Visiting the sun-splashed beaches of Okinawa costs a Tokyo couple about as much as a hop to Hawaii . For $342 , a Parisian can choose either a 1 1/2-hour flight to Corsica or an eight-hour trip to New York on planes chartered by the French tour operator Nouvelles Frontieres . And now that a pound buys $1.87 ( up from $1.04 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as a Virgin Atlantic Airways offer that takes them to New York on a Thursday , deposits them in a hotel for three nights and gets them back , bleary-eyed , to London 's Gatwick Airport by the following Monday morning  --  all for $690 . A similar jaunt from London to Rome would cost $537  --  but the pound does not go nearly as far in Italy as it does in the U.S.
