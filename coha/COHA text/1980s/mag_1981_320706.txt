Needed : individual awareness of a new sense of nationhood <P> Whatever the institutional mechanics of it , the real renovation of America must begin in Americans ' minds . It must express itself in their civic morale , their sense of individual responsibility for themselves , for the communities and the nation around them . It is not enough to say that the Government has failed , that the System has failed . That accusation subtly absolves individual citizens of blame but also leaves them feeling like abjectly passive victims of immense **26;5061;TOOLONG , multinational corporations . No society can flourish , or even function , if its people do not feel responsible for it any more . <P> America will get better only when Americans are convinced that it is up to them to make it better . For a decade or more Americans have tended to behave like submissive passengers aboard a national vehicle that veered unpredictably across the landscape : a succession of distracted presidential drivers kept coming up with the steering wheel loose in their hands . The great enterprise , the distressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no good end , but in any case , it was beyond their control . <P> Larger and darker forces were at work : <P> inflation , crime , OPEC , the crippling onset of vulnerability and mediocrity , the shame of Watergate , the humiliation of Viet Nam . The grace that historically seemed to have attended American ventures appeared to have been mysteriously withdrawn , and the people fell into an apprehensive gloom , like adolescents suffering the sudden and unexpected disapproval of their fathers : of history . <P> The loss of American self-confidence was especially shocking because previous generations had seemed so powerful and virtuous .

Those luminous people were the Americans , heroic with their sappy " gosh , " their shy Jimmy Stewart goodness . ( " Sentimental ? You bet ! Say , this is a swell country , and ...

The best in people from all over the world is growing here into the first real nation of the world - the American nation . " A few months after the broadcast , the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor , and the People of Light went overseas and saved the world . <P> It has been a while since Americans have felt that way about themselves . All the notorious national wounds left many with a wintry , elegiac view of the country and its future . The nation that was once the world 's most famous optimist began to shuffle around in a bathrobe , feeling mediocre and depleted , listening to threnodies by the Club of Rome .                @ @ @ @ @
