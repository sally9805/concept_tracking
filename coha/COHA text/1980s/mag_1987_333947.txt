History , wrote Gibbon , is little more than a " register of crimes , sorrows and misfortunes . " It is , equally often , a study in black ironies or the fatal mechanisms of tragedy . Sometimes history is even a cautionary tale , an Aesopian fable on the folly of blindness or greed or lust . But history is rarely a fairy tale , a narrative that instructs as well as inspires . Still less often is it a morality play , in which the forces of corruption and redemption , of extravagance and modesty collide in perfect symmetry . <P> In 1986 , however , as all the global village looked on , history turned into a clash of symbols in the Republic of the Philippines , a nation long relegated to its dustier corridors . There in the Southeast Asian archipelago of 56 million people and more than 7,000 islands , life not only imitated art but improved upon it . In a made-for-television drama watched by millions , two veteran rulers , President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda , stumbled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immodesty broader than a scriptwriter 's fancy , their stolen empire . <P> During the final years of his " constitutional authoritarianism , " Marcos had effectively moved his country backward  --  from democracy to autocracy , from prosperity to poverty , from general peace to a widespread Communist insurgency . Treating the national treasury as if it were their personal checking account , the royal couple had looted their land of perhaps $5 billion . " Here in the Philippines , " said Imelda , " we live in a paradise . There are no poor people as there are in other countries . " Even as she spoke , seven in every ten Filipinos were living below the poverty level . <P> The sudden turn of fortune 's wheel came when a confident Marcos , who had never lost a vote in his life , called a snap election . He was thus hoping to satisfy the Reagan Administration 's demands that he become more democratic . But Marcos ' plans for victory were upset by a slight , bespectacled mother of five , who had entered politics only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her application for the presidency , Corazon Aquino had nothing to enter under OCCUPATION but " Housewife . " The last office for which the soft-spoken - widow had been chosen was valedictorian of her sixth-grade class . In fact , her chief , if not her only , political strengths seemed to be her innocence of politics and the moral symbolism of her name . In Spanish , her first name meant " heart " ; in Philippine politics , her second signified " martyred opposition , " in memory of her late husband Benigno ( Ninoy ) Aquino , once Marcos ' chief rival , who was slain on his return from exile in 1983 . Cory Aquino , at 53 , stood in effect on a platform of faith , hope and charity . <P> The outcome of the allegorical battle seemed pre-scripted , if not predestined . Marcos , who had once been an effective and even popular ruler , in recent years had gradually proved brilliant enough to rewrite the rules and brutal enough to enforce them . On election day in February , in full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ripped up ballots , bought others and intimidated voters at gunpoint . As many as 3 million names were simply struck off the voter lists .
