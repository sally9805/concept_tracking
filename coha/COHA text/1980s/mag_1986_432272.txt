 | G asoline quality is changing . ? A characteristic engineers call vapor pressure has been rising for several years . Auto-company experts say this causes vapor lock , fuel foaming , hotstarting problems , unstable idling , and more . ? Alcohol added to gasoline , while defended by some authorities , is condemned by others . They charge it produces drivability problems and , in some cases , possibly damages parts in the fuel system . ? Detergency of at least some gasolines seems to be falling , producing clogged fuel injectors and carburetors . Just how bad is the situation ? It depends on who you ask . The most outspoken representative of the auto industry is Gil Clark , a fuel specialist at Chrysler . " Changes in gasoline quality , " he says , " have never been more significant ? or more troublesome to the motorist ? than they have become in the last three years . " Others have a different opinion : " In general , " counters C. B. Hood , manager of fuels technical services at Mobil Oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . All gasoline is n't the same , but gasoline quality overall is the best it 's ever been , and that 's certainly true so far as our company is concerned . " Where does the truth lie ? As is often the case , the situation is both controversial and complicated . Certainly , most of the gasoline sold today , particularly that blended by the major oil companies , meets industry standards . It 's the standards that need to be changed , counter the autocompany experts . Then there 's the really bad gas ? gas that is improperly and in many cases illegally blended . No one knows how much of it is being sold . This is the stuff that can really get you into trouble . To get at the facts , I interviewed engineers at major auto and oil companies and talked to independent experts . Here 's what I learned . What 's happening and why Gasoline is not a single substance , but a mix of scores of hydrocarbons ? molecules made of hydrogen and carbon . They range from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An ideal fuel is balanced ; it has low vapor pressure ? a high boiling point ? to avoid vapor lock , but enough volatile elements for easy starting . Petroleum companies vary the blend constantly . Winter gasoline , for example , is more volatile than summer gasoline for easier cold-weather starting . Car manufacturers feel that the biggest problem today is volatility 's upward creep , especially in the summer . It would seem to be an easy problem to solve : Simply blend a less volatile mix . In principle , that 's true . But a complex web of economic , legal , political , and engineering considerations are conspiring to push gasoline 's volatility up rather than down . Volatility is measured in terms of vapor pressure . Vapor pressure quantifies a given fuel 's tendency to vaporize ? to turn from a liquid to a gas . It is measured by what engineers call the Reid vapor-pressure ( RVP ) test . One expert who spends a lot of his time studying trends in vapor pressure is Chrysler 's Gil Clark . Clark describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part . He showed me what the RVP test is all about . You start by chilling both a small brass container and a gasoline sample down to about 30 degrees F. " Then you completely fill the chilled chamber with the gasoline , " he says in his soft Texas twang , " and screw it onto the bottom of a brass tube with a pressure gauge at the top . Now you have captured a sample of gasoline in a closed container with a vapor space above the chamber . Next you drop the whole assembly into water at a hundred degrees , and wait fifteen or twenty minutes while it all comes up to temperature . During that time some of the gasoline vaporizes and the pressure in the tube rises . Then you simply read the gauge . " That number ? it used to be about nine in summer and 12 in winter ? has been creeping up . Why is that important ? Clark explains : " You pull off the freeway on a hot day to pick up a loaf of bread on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the five minutes you 're in the store everything under the hood gets a hot soak . You come back , hop in , start the car , and head out . It will start and run across the parking lot , where the fuel demand is low . But the hot gasoline began to boil while you were in the store . It makes so much vapor that the fuel pump is windmilling full of vapor and not delivering enough liquid fuel . When you try to accelerate to reenter the traffic stream , the engine dies lean is starved for fuel . " The opposite can happen . " Some cars now have fuel pumps with sixty to eighty times the pumping capacity needed for constant speed , " adds Clark . " In this situation , hot fuel instead of just vapor will reach the high-temperature environment under the hood and foam just like shaken soda pop . That fuel bubbles out of the bowl vent , falls into the carburetor , and causes the engine to run rich . Fuel foaming is a brand-new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years as fuel volatility has crept upward . " The situation can be serious . Last June , a load of winterized , or high volatility , gas was shipped to Albuquerque , N.M . " Stalled cars were lined up as far as the eye could see , " says Sandy Brady of Albuquerque 's Better Business Bureau . " The worst time often comes on a unusually warm day in spring , " says Robert Everett of GM 's emissions-control staff . " Winter gas is still in the pumps , and @#  | cars are stalled all over the expressways . The problem for us is that those customers do n't recognize the fuel-volatility problem . They blame the car . " And it may even cause unnecessary repairs . " If you spend an hour on the side of the road with your stalled car , " says Clark , " the problem will cure itself as the car cools down , and you 'll eventually be able to start again . But if you 're unlucky enough to get a tow truck in a hurry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanic may want to replace all of the pieces of the fuel system he can see . I heard of one fellow who had his fuel pump replaced seven times when the real problem was the gasoline supply . " Despite such stories , is the problem really serious ? While some auto people claim it is , oil-industry experts take a different point of view . " Late-model cars , " says Hood of Mobil , " are less sensitive to gasoline volatility than their predecessors . Many have fuel pumps in the fuel tank , making them less sensitive to vapor lock . Many individual cars may still be sensitive to vapor lock and other volatil-@# ity problems because of one or more defects such as *4 misrouted fuel line , missing insulation , or a marginal : , defective cooling system . " And Jim Smith , an Amoco Oil Co. product engineer , adds flatly , " The only time customers experience problems with vapor lock is during the summer . And these instances are fairly rare except with temperatures in excess of ninety-five degrees . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental facts : Crude oil does n't contain the various kinds of hydrocarbons in the amounts they 're needed for gasoline . For example , an average barrel of crude yields about 28 percent gasoline . The industry would like and could use 45 to 50 percent . In addition , an engine fuel must have a sufficiently high octane for the engine in which it is to be used . Octane is a measure of a fuel 's ability to burn smoothly and deliver power to the piston , rather than exploding suddenly and causing possibly damaging engine knock . For decades , refiners added a substance called tetraethyl lead to gasoline to improve octane . But during the early 1970s , the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) mandated that lead be removed from gasoline . That made the percentage of gasoline available from a barrel of crude fall further , since it did n't contain enough high-octane ingredients to make the whole mix satisfactory . So refiners turned to a refining technique called reforming ? a process that combines certain light molecules to make more complex high-octane molecules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not free , however : The higher the temperature and the longer it 's held , the higher the octane ? but the lower the yield In fact , some 20 to 30 percent of the original is lost in the form of butane and other less valuable products . That 's why unleaded gasoline costs more than leaded of a gives octane . Octane can also be improved slightly by adding butanes and a few other relatively cheap , light fractions . And ( flat works right in with reforming . " Generally , the things : at manufacture octane also manufacture higher-volat : : . : z components such as butane , " says James De Jovine , manager of testing and refinery technology for Atlantic Richfield Co . " And butane , which has fairly high octane . M cheaper than gasoline . So to raise octane and at the -. , ? . - time make your product as economical as possible . want to use butane to the fullest extent possible . ' . increasing octane also tends to increase volatility. @# material deleted This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis , because adding alcohol not only helped raise octane numbers but helped stretch scarce petroleum reserves . Some marketers add up to 10 percent ethanol , producing gasohol . To encourage this trend , many states and the federal government have enacted tax laws giving gas . ohol special tax breaks . Other marketers add methanol ? so-called wood alcohol , actually made today mostly from natural gas . It also raises octane and burns well in an automobile engine . The problem : " When you add ten percent ethanol to gasoline , " says Clark , " its vapor pressure goes up one-half to one-and-a. half pounds . " Methanol can cause a similar problem : R. H. Thring of the Southwest Research Institute reported in a Society of Automotive Engineers paper that adding even just two percent methanol to gasoline can raise its vapor pressure by more than three pounds ? enough to get a lot of cars into trouble . So , because of the quality of crude oil , blending problems , removal of lead , addition of light elements for octane improvement , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the early ' 70s . How much is it actually up ? Twice a year , in January and July , the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn. takes about 450 gas sampies from several dozen cities across the country , As the accompanying graph shows , pressure has gone from nine to above 10 in the summer , from 12 to above 13 in winter . These levels , oil companies are quick to point out , are within industry standards , set by the American Society for Testing and Materials , a widely respected standards ? setting group including representatives of both oil and auto companies . ASTM standards allow volatilities up to 15 in winter and 11.5 in summer . Thus if all gasoline were at average Ievels , the auto industry could probably live with it . However , some experts claim that many blends now sold are substantially higher . Says Clark : " One night last winter I stopped at the six or seven gas stations between here and my house and got gas samples . When I got home I ran vapor-pressure tests on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side of the coin is that if some gasoline is above average volatility ? a point few deny ? then other gasoline must be below . But the problem is even more complicated . Some auto experts say the numbers , while within standards , are too high , that they should be brought back down to the nine summer and 12 winter of several years ago . So why do n't the oil companies and blenders simply blend gasoline to have lower vapor pressure ? Because the resultant fuel would cost more . Why do n't auto companies make cars more tolerant of high-volatility fuels ? In fact , they have been making cars less sensitive to rising volatility by making changes such as adding more-powerful fuel pumps . But some auto men claim this has backfired . " When the oil companies found out that the new cars were less sensitive , " says Joe Coluccl of General Motors Corp. , " they pushed the volatility up . " Marvin Jackson , an emissions-control engineer at GM , adds : " If we build cars in 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll realize that they can up the volatility again and make more trips to the bank . " The problem is worse in some areas than in others . " The more progressive oil companies have modernized their refineries to take care of the crude they have to work with , " continues Colucci . " But the smaller guys are being pushed for octane . They do n't have the facilities for refining the octane into the gasoline . So they 're more likely to go out into the spot market and buy alcohols and other higher-octane feedstocks that you would n't ordinarily put in gasoline because they push up vapor pressure . " Increasing emissions Another problem : When the EPA set auto emissions standards several years ago , gasoline was running around nine pounds in summer . Now , with averages higher , hydrocarbon emissions are up . A General Motors research team recently checked the emissions of cars across the country . They found that with RVP figures averaging around 10.5 pounds , emissions were up sharply . They also found that reducing pressure from 10.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years ago would reduce hydrocarbon emissions by nine to 25 percent . A GM technical paper points out that gasoline with high pressures overloads the current carbon canisters , which were designed to reduce pollution but were designed for lower pressure fuel . " Our canisters are simply not designed to handle these high-volatility fuels , " says Colucci . ( Another related problem : With high-volatility fuels that overpower the canisters , a certain portion of the fuel pumped into your tank never reaches the engine . It evaporates , and the canister is n't up to stopping it . ) The car makers fear that the EPA will demand expensive fixes to reduce pollution ? fixes the car makers say would n't be needed if gasoline were made with lower vapor pressures . " All the work we 're doing to build emissions controls will go down the drain , " says Jackson . " It 's easy to see a scenario where we get more expensive requirements put on , and the volatility continues to climb . We end up chasing our tail . " Yet more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car manufacturers . Among the others : ? Methanol may damage some parts of the fuel system . " Alcohols are corrosive and react with lead , magnesium , aluminum , and some plastics and elastomers rubbers ' , " says Thring in his SAE paper . He also points out @# @# that such problems are minimal when alcohol concentrations are kept below approximately 10 percent . Chrysler reports that some rubber carbureter - parts have been degraded and recommends that Chrysler car owners m use methanol blends . Atlantic Richfield , on the other hand , has done extensive testing of many different materials and has published scientifi.c papers reporting no significant difference in those materials exposed to Oxinol ? a methanol blend ? ove : those exposed to pure gasoline . ? Water may cause alcohol to separate from gasoline . " Methanol has a : affinity for water , " says Clark . " It may then separate . If that happens , it rusts the inside of the mild-steel fuel lineand fuel tank and corrodes conven tional carburetor and fuel-pump met als . " Atlantic Richfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem with the inclusion of a cosolvent ? a substance called GTBA. ( gasoline-grade tertiary butyl alcohol Atlantic Richfield has also placed great emphasis on dealers thorough : ? cleaning all tanks and eliminating th ' danger of water contamination befor ' . methanol blends are delivered . ( Thy company also claims that GTBA lo ? - ers vapor pressure . ) At the moment , most auto companies approve of the use of ethane blends . But they 're divided on methanol . General Motors , Ford , Toyota Honda , and AMC say up to five percent methanol is OK . Chrysler , Nissan , Mazda , Subaru , VW , and Vol say do n't use it . How clean ? Twenty years ago Mobil Oil Cori : began an ad campaign pushing highdetergency gasoline . It goes on to thiday . However , the emphasis on detergency has not been industry wide . I : fact , there is some evidence that a ' - erage detergency is falling , and that some gas contains no detergent at al : This can be important , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to low detergency . To se , why , visualize a fuel injector 's pint , , valve . It 's built like a garden-hose nozzle . When the pintle is activated . it lifts off the conical seat and produce a cone-shaped spray of fuel . Each time the valve closes , fuel left on the enc. of the valve evaporates . After man : . repeated cycles , there can be a deposit from the evaporating fuel . And the space at the top of the nozzle getsmaller , upsetting the spray pattern .. The result is loss of power , misfiring. surging , and poor drivability . A good detergent can prevent deposits or remove them if they have already begun to form .  | So serious is this problem that GM vice chairman Howard H. Kehrl recently wrote to major oil-company presidents and executives . " It has become increasingly evident that portfuel-injection systems are sensitive to fuel quality , " he said . " Their performance can be seriously impaired by deposits that form at the injector tip and inhibit fuel flow " He said that GM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right back . GM has asked the oil companies to reveal their plans , and some have indicated they will raise detergency . The GM letter implied that the company might recommend such specific brands of gas for GM cars . So just where does detergency stand ? Nobody knows for sure . Fred Ruhland , an account manager at the fuel-products group at Lubrizol , one of the country 's biggest suppliers of additives for both gas and oil , says the picture has changed in recent years . He says the amounts of detergents used are sharply down , but the effect is hard to know because some newer detergent materials are more effective than older ones . " A few companies were using between three hundred and a thousand pounds of detergent per thousand barrels of gasoline in the early seventies , " he says . " Now many of them have come down to between three and five hundred pounds . A growing problem has come about because the majority of the oil companies use a treatment in the range of eight pounds of detergent per thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent ? use no additives at all . " Yet other companies have apparently been actually increasing detergency . For example , Hood of Mobil says : " We 've improved the detergent package to the point where our regular unleaded prevents deposit buildup in carburetors and port fuel injectors , and our new super unleaded can actually clean up dirty fuel injectors . This recent Mobil development has won auto-industry praise , notably by the vice chairman of GM " Adds De Jovine of Atlantic Richfield : " We use more detergent , a higher cost detergent , now than five years ago . " One other important point : The gasoline business ? like all others ? undoubtedly has some dishonest operators . In fact , industry insiders talk about a phenomenon called splash blending . During the day , a tank truck filled with legitimate gasoline pulls into a service station and partly fills the holding tank . That night a truck filled with alcohol or a cheaper but higher volatility gasoline fraction @#  | pulls in and dumps another load . The result , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and headaches ? and maybe extra repair bills ? for the unwary customer . Many problems associated with bad gas undoubtedly come from such practices . Although the people who do such things do n't usually admit it , one interesting case has come to light . Vic Rasheed , executive director of the Service Station Dealers of America , said he heard a blender at a recent trade meeting say : " I just add until they start complaining . " What can you do about it ? First , buy gasoline at stations that have pumps with labels saying the gas contains detergents . Second , avoid buying gas at a station that gives you a tankful of problem fuel . You can also recognize that all gasoline is not alike . If you suspect that car misbehavior may be gasoline related , try another brand of fuel before attempting repairs . And when @# you find a gasoline that works , stick with it . Finally , as with most other products , you 're most likely to get quality from a reputable company with a reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubtedly be made more tolerant of high-vapor-pressure fuels . Fuel systems will be and are being designed to remove materials likely to be damaged by alcohol blends . More cars are appearing each year with fuel injectors . And fuel injectors , though sensitive to fouling , are more resistant to vapor lock and fuel foaming . Fuel pumps are being designed to pump more fuel , reducing vaporlock sensitivity . And anti-foaming devices are also being built into fuel systems . There is also a move toward state regulation . Twenty-eight states have requirements for labeling alcohol content , if any , and a few ? such as California ? actually regulate vapor pressure . Some are urging the EPA to attempt to control emissions by requiring certain levels of detergency. vapor pressure , and other qualities . The EPA reportedly has these matters under study . The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn. has been urging complete disclosure on the label attached to every gas pump . The fact is that both the auto makers and the oil companies are in very competitive businesses . Fuel with good detergency , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a study commissioned by the EPA , Bonner and Moore , Inc. , an oil-industry consulting firm , estimates that vapor-pressure reduction costs 0.6 cent per pound of reduction per gallon of gasoline . A two-pound reduction would cost almost 11/2 cents per gallon . The oil companies , of course , would like to keep prices down . They 'd rather see the automobile companies make the fixes . That would increase the cost of cars , of course . The car companies . on the other hand , would find life easier if average vapor pressure were brought back to the old standard level of about nine . It 's not the first time that similar situations have developed . The truth is that gradually new technologies will evolve that will chip off bits of the problem here and there ; prices will go up a little for fuel and a little for cars : and some new problem will come along to attract our attention . In the meantime , you can be aware of the kinds of problems bad gas can cause and , so armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers who do n't get caught .
