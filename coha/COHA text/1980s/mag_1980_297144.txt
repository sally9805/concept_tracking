New hopes , and old frustrations , as negotiations drag on <P> On the 400th day of captivity for the 52 Americans in Iran , the father of Hostage Kevin Hermening raised the 400th U.S. flag at Hillcrest cemetery in Hermitage , Pa . The flag had once flown over the U.S.S. Arizona , which 39 years ago fell under attack from the Japanese at Pearl Harbor . The 404th day , however , brought new hopes for the hostages ' imminent return-hopes that were lowered almost as soon as the 404th flag was raised . <P> As-Safir , a leftist Beirut newspaper reported to be close to the Tehran regime , quoted an informed Iranian source as saying , " Agreement has been completed between the U.S. and Iran to resolve the hostage issue . They are expected to be freed on the 25th of this month . " Within hours , however , it became evident that the report was false . Behzad Nabavi , head of the Iranian committee that is negotiating with the U.S. , flatly denied the report . He also asserted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands , that of allowing U.S. courts to decide the fate of the late Shah 's fortune , " is absolutely not acceptable . " <P> U.S. officials had hoped that the proposal would be a breakthrough in the negotiations , since they had reportedly already agreed to two other demands , namely a U.S. pledge of noninterference in Iranian affairs and the unfreezing of $13 billion in U.S.-held Iranian assets .

Said one senior White House official : " The real problem is that this issue still requires a political decision in Tehran . The political will to end it all simply has not jelled . " <P> Still , there were indications that at least some answer to the U.S. proposals might be forthcoming . In an interview published at week 's end in a Tehran newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the U.S. might meet his country 's demands . In recent weeks Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini has eased his obdurate attitude on the hostage question . Moderate President Abolhassan Banisadr , who is in favor of the hostages ' release , seems to be gaining in visibility because of his handling of the war with Iraq . Indeed , as the valiant defense of the refinery city of Abadan went into its ninth week , Banisadr 's influence with the military continued to grow .
