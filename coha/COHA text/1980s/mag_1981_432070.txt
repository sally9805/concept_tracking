 | For the first time in three years , Americans can look forward to continued relief from double-digit inflation . That bright prospect is offered by private and government economists as well as those who sell the goods and services that account for the bulk of family spending . The Economic Unit of US.News &; World Report predicts that the prices consumers pay in the last three months of this year will be 9 percent higher than they were in the final quarter of last year . The inflation rate in 1982 should stay below 10 percent a year . Other experts agree . Price increases for 1982 as a whole will be 8.7 percent , according to the average projection of five major forecasting outfits polled by Eggert Economic Enterprises , Inc . Does this mean the back of inflation is broken ? Not necessarily . Prices are still rising at a historically fast rate . Much of this spring 's slowdown in inflation results from " unsustainably low numbers " for food and oil , contends economist Alan Greenspan , president of TownsendGreenspan &; Company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guaranty Trust Company of New York add this warning in the bank 's monthly letter : " The easing of inflation in prospect for the year ahead is primarily a cyclical improvement helped by some good fortune . It should not be interpreted as a signal to relax antiinflation efforts . " What is happening is that a number of favorable factors are coming together . The price of crude oil , which exporting countries were able to raise almost at whim , now appears to be headed lower ? at least in the short run . Supplies of beef and pork are larger than had been expected , keeping rises in retail food prices below what had been predicted . Workers are beginning to turn out more goods per hour worked , a key factor in cutting long-term costs . A stronger dollar in money markets abroad is tending to hold down prices of imports and , indirectly , U.S.-made goods that compete with them . Prices of important raw materials have been sluggish in the face of weakened economies around the world , thus giving Americans a breather on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money are likely to keep consumers from going on a buying binge , thus easing pressure on many prices . For what these trends will mean in the prices that you pay in the months ahead , staff members of USN &; WR talked with authorities in key American industries Food . " Buy now and fill your freezer , " advises Ralph Parlett , economist at the Department of Agriculture . He predicts that the moderate increases in food prices seen so far in 1981 will end in August . The official forecast is for grocery prices to rise at a rate of between 9 and 11 percent this year , rather than between 10 to 15 percent as estimated late last year . Recent rains have reduced drought problems . Most of the price increases will come in the second half of the year as meat supplies fall . Other government predictions : Beef this summer will go up to between $2.50 and $2.55 a pound from an average of $2.34 in the first half . The price of pork products , which has fallen since last autumn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of about $1.45 a pound to between $1.65 and $1.70 . Chicken prices will be relatively stable for the rest of the year because of an expected surge in production . By fall , a dozen grade-A large eggs will cost an estimated 76 to 79 cents in New York , up from 70 cents a year ago . Shoppers will pay about the same as last year for Thanksgiving and Christmas turkeys . Sugar , now about 44 cents a pound , will reverse its present downward trend in the second half , reaching 45 to 48 cents a pound by year-end . Coffee , now selling around $2.56 a pound , will decline even more because of ample world supplies . But it is unlikely to fall below $2 , because of export restrictions by coffee-growing countries . A support bill pending in Congress could increase milk prices starting on October 1 . The cost of eating out will rise 10 percent this year over last , according to Betty Hoyt , economist with the National Restaurant Association . Housing . Prices of new homes are likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in several years , says Robert J. Sheehan , head of economic research for the National Association of Home Builders . He sees the median price of a new home hitting $72,000 in the fourth quarter , up from $66,800 a year earlier . Interest rates on mortgages , now in the range of 15 to 16 percent , are expected to head down slowly ? but not by much . " The best we can expect is around 14 percent by the end of the year , " Tom Parliment , economist with the U.S. League of Savings Associations , predicts . Apartment rents will rise 7 to 71/2  | percent this year over last , Michael Solomon of the National Apartment Association , predicts . He explains : " Rents may start to rise faster relative to the consumer price index as vacancy rates tighten up nationwide . " Furniture prices will show only modest increases for the rest of the year because of stiff competition and the slow sales that stem from a poor housing market , says Michael Sherman , economist for the National Association of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 percent faster than overall inflation , says Tom Daugherty , director of statistics for the Edison Electric Institute . Increased use of coal and nuclear energy instead of oil is keeping down rises in electric bills , Daugherty explains . Declining prices for fuel oil should help , too . Prices of natural gas for homes will continue to rise steadily as a result of phased-in decontrol . The American Gas Association is predicting that home gas bills will increase about 15 percent this year , a little slower than in 1980 . Congressional action speeding decontrol would result in faster increases . Prices of home-heating oil are on the way down as a result of the worldwide glut and falling prices of crude oil . The Economic Unit of this magazine forecasts that oil prices will drop as much as 7 cents a gallon to the range of $1.20 by the start of the next heating season . Shoe , apparel prices will rise modestly . Long-distance interstate phoning has just risen 16 percent . The American Telephone &; Telegraph Company got a rate increase of 724 million dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls are falling 35 percent . Automobiles . By the time all price boosts are added up , autos sold in 1981 will have risen 10 to 11 percent over 1980 sales . The average selling price of a new car will hit $8,320 , estimates Tom Webb , economist at the National Automobile Dealers Association . Industry experts do not look for another major round of rebates , such as those that pared consumers ' costs of American-made cars especially this spring . What 's more , the voluntary quota that Japan imposed on its shipments of autos here under pressure from the U.S. is likely to push prices up . As supplies of popular Japanese cars are restricted , dealers are expected to raise prices . In turn , that will make it easier for U.S. manufacturers to boost their own prices . For used cars , Webb believes that prices will go up about 8 ? percent in 1981 over 1980 to an average of about $3,700 . He expects that prices of used cars will increase faster in this year 's second half ? now beginning ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the basic trend of moderately rising prices for clothing , says Richard Sines , chief economist for the American Apparel Manufacturers Association . A highly competitive domestic industry , growing import penetration and higher productivity all help keep increases in clothing prices below the overall trend of consumer prices . Tom L. Moore , executive director of Menswear Retailers of America , notes that price changes have been " minimal " for men 's clothing this year . He says many men have been buying traditionally styled clothes so they last longer . Shoe prices will continue to increase in the range of 5 to 6 percent the rest of the year , according to Rita Cavanagh , senior economist for the American Footwear Industries Association . Medical care . Over all , health-care costs probably will rise by an average of 10.3 percent in 1981 over 1980 , says Steve Dreyer , an economist at Chase Econometrics . Chase forecasts that drug and medicine costs will go up 9.7 percent , physicians ' fees 10 percent and dentists ' bills 10.2 percent . The cost of a day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13.4 percent from 1980 , the Department of Health and Human Services estimates . Travel . Motorists will see prices at gas pumps falling more the rest of the year . Average price per gallon for all types is expected to drop to as low as $1.30 by the end of 1981 from $1.37 in May . Some U.S. refiners have dropped their wholesale price of gasoline in response to competition and a decline in the U.S. crude-oil price from $36 to $34 a barrel . Traveling by rail will be more expensive , however . Amtrak , the national rail-passenger service , increased fares an average of 10 percent nationwide last April . This summer Amtrak has added a surcharge of 15 percent on tickets of passengers using sleeping accommodations . Another general fare increase is scheduled by Amtrak for October . Air fares , up 20 percent so far in 1981 over 1980 , should increase more slowly in the second half of this year , as a result of increased competition and moderating fuel prices . Higher fares will come mainly on shorter routes , says Barbara L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an airlines consulting service . Price wars will continue in major longhaul markets such as New York ? West Coast runs and transatlantic flights , she says , with cuts of 50 percent for nonbusiness travelers . Major hotel and motel chains raised their room rates 3 to 4 percent in the first half of 1981 . But that 's just a start : A jump of 10 to 11 percent is expected for the whole year by George Novello , hotel expert at E. F. Hutton &; Company . New hotels will tend to have much higher rates than older ones to recoup steeper construction costs . Services .

Total tuition , room and board at four-year private universities this fall will increase to an average of $7,400 , up 10 percent from 1980 . That 's the estimate of Vance Grant , head statistician for the National Center for Education Statistics . The National Football League says that the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $12 . The average last season was $11.25 . Thus , despite the slowdown in inflation generally , you will find it difficult to escape higher prices .
