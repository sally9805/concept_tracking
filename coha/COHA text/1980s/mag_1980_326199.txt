Agee shakes up his company <P> William M. Agee , 42 , of Bendix Corp. , is an unorthodox manager . After becoming chairman of the automotive and aerospace manufacturer in 1977 , he set up a telephone line so that employees could call him directly about complaints . He then abolished the main conference table in the company 's headquarters , arguing that this would enhance conversations among the firm 's officials . Directors at board meetings now sit around the room in comfortable office chairs . He decreed that the best parking space in the company lot be reserved not for himself but for the person who arrived first at work each day . For his part , Agee , who sometimes shuns corporate pinstripes in favor of an open-necked shirt and slacks , pulls up in a new silver Corvette . <P> Now Agee , who at 31 was chief financial officer of Boise Cascade Paper Co. , is shaking up Bendix , which last year ranked 88th on the Fortune 500 list with sales of $3.8 billion and profits of $163 million . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million timber operations as well as $300 million of stock in Asarco , which mines copper and other metals . He wants Bendix to concentrate more on high technology and electronics and less on natural resources . <P> Agee also made some major personnel changes and decentralized the firm 's management by appointing four new operating group heads . In so doing , he unintentionally set off titillating gossip that he was involved in an executive-suite romance . President William Panny and Executive Vice President Jerome Jacobson departed . Jacobson 's replacement as a vice president and chief corporate planner is Mary E. Cunningham , 29 , a striking blond who joined Bendix just 15 months ago as Agee 's executive assistant . A Wellesley College magna cum laude graduate and , like her boss , the holder of a Harvard M.B.A. , she has emerged as the chairman 's top adviser . <P> Bendix rumor mills immediately went into overtime . Cunningham is separated from her New York-based husband , while Agee has just been divorced from his wife of 23 years . <P> Putting a stop to that speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agee last week summoned a meeting of company staff to dispel the rumors that his new vice president had become a most favored employee . " I know it has been buzzing around that Mary Cunningham 's rise in this company is very unusual and that it has something to do with a personal relationship we have , " he said . " It is true that we are very close friends . But that has nothing to do with the way that I and others in this company evaluate her performance . " For her part , Cunningham called the corridor talk sexist . Said she : " Unfortunately , we 're culturally bound by norms that preclude in many minds the existence of someone like myself . " After the conference , company officials said there would be a major announcement by Cunningham and Agee . That sparked further speculation about wedding plans . But then the announcement was canceled without any explanation .
