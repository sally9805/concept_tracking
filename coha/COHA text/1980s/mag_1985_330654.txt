" The first thing is to straighten your spine , " says Allen Ginsberg , as he starts his tai chi chuan , the Chinese exercises he recommends for healthful testicles and liver . With arms extended and hands as graceful as cobra heads , he begins the ritual steps , fluidly shifting his weight from one slippered foot to the other . The martial exercise is based on a subtle principle . " The aggressor is off balance , " Ginsberg explains . " The person who is nonaggressive is in balance . " <P> This is a fetching idea and one that applies to America 's most public poet . Approaching his autumnal years , the man once feared as a weevil in the nation 's moral fiber is in a disarming state of equilibrium . Cultural norms have adjusted in Ginsberg 's favor since 1956 , when he disturbed the peace with Howl . It was a poetic tantrum thrown at the Eisenhower years , at an academic system that rejected his rude unconventionality , at an encompassing conspiracy he imagined had driven his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he cried . " Robot apartments ! invisible suburbs ! skeleton treasuries ! blind capitals ! demonic industries ! spectral nations ! invincible madhouses ! " <P> The bearded rebel from Paterson , N.J. , also flaunted the subjects of drug use and homosexuality with an explicitness that would have unnerved Walt Whitman , the American bard whose confessional style Ginsberg 's most resembles . Yet today , millions of housewives casually tune in to hopheads and gays on The Phil Donahue Show , and Allen Ginsberg is a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters . He is a recipient of fellowships , grants and a National Book Award . He recently returned from a month-long tour of China as guest of the Chinese Writers Association . Once he might have declared the experience groovy . Now he calmly brings the news : " In private the people I spoke with have clear , Mozartian minds . In public they are silent . " <P> Sartorially , Ginsberg meets his fellow citizens halfway : sports jackets , slacks , shirts and ties bought secondhand at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run-down East Village is furnished in Early Struggling Artist : an assortment of old tables and chairs , aging appliances and , for some reason having to do with a previous renovation , a kitchen sink in the living room . The walk-up tenement has no working front bell . To enter , a visitor must call up from the sidewalk and wait for the poet to throw down a key rolled up in a sock . <P> This charming rite may soon end . Real estate speculators have bought the building , says Ginsberg , and are trying to evict its occupants . The neighborhood , a center for low-income artists , is undergoing gentrification . So , perhaps , is Ginsberg . His earlier works were printed by small presses , notably City Lights Books , Lawrence Ferlinghetti 's Beat Generation landmark in San Francisco . Now , for the first time , Ginsberg has an agent and a six-book contract with a major New York publisher .
