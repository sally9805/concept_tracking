 | The New York art world was a cozy place to grow up in the ' 50s . Look at some snapshots from a Helen Frankenthaler scrapbook : the young artist at Eddie Condon 's jazz club with Jackson Pollock , Lee Krasner and the critic Clement Greenberg ; laughing while she hugs a straight-faced David Smith ; in a convertible on a high summer 's day in Provincetown with Robert Motherwell , her husband for 13 years . The New York School was a hothouse for such secondgeneration painters as Frankenthaler , and though that air of youthful camaraderie belongs to a ghostly past , she is still making the huge , beautiful , assured abstractions that were first sparked by Pollock 's drip paintings . " While I acknowledge the changes that go on around me , " she says , " a lot of it is meaningless to me , because I continue to do the work that I do . " On the quiet , sunny Manhattan street where she keeps a studio ? light years away from the hip hurly-burly of the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaken for any well-heeled East Side matron . Arriving at the studio in a crisp , bluestriped shirtwaist and silk scarf , carrying a Chanel handbag and a fragrant bunch of deep-yellow freesia , she talked about the retrospective that opens this week at the Museum of Modern Art , an event she 's greeting with a mixture of " anxiety and joy . " Frankenthaler , arguably the most important painter of her generation , has kept on working with enormous vitality ; one beautiful recent painting , called " The Somnambulist , " mostly dark but shot with green , was hanging above the Mies van der Rohe couch in her studio as she spoke . And though her ' 50s cir- cle is dispersed , she still talks art with a few cronies such as Greenberg , as well as with such newer friends as John Elderfield , the MOMA curator who spent 10 years working on the new Frankenthaler monograph published by Abrams ? a tome so lavish it has the heft of a wallpaper sample book . From the start , Frankenthaler as an artist was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follower , " she has said . In part , wrote the critic Barbara Rose , this stemmed from " her sense of personal security . " The third daughter of a New York State Supreme Court justice , Frankenthaler was raised on Park Avenue in an atmosphere of cultural savvy . When she won a minor prize in a children 's art contest , her doting father bought her a tiny charm shaped like a gold palette at Tiffany 's . Though he died when she was 11 , she went on to the best private schools and had an inheritance to support her when she began her career as a painter after college . At 21 , she met Greenberg , Pollock 's great champion , at an exhibit of Bennington alumnae work , and during their five-year relationship she met most of the major figures in the postwar art world . It was Greenberg who unlocked her studio to show her legendary 1952 painting , " Mountains and Sea , " to Kenneth Noland and Morris Louis ; Louis proclaimed it " a bridge from Pollock to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was spread a carpet of raw canvas on the floor as Pollock had done , but rather than drip thick globs of pigment on it , she thinned the paint to watery fluid and poured it on so that it soaked in , staining the fabric with airy patches of glorious color . In her more recent paintings , color is often layered , but her methods are much the same . The pictures are controlled serendipity ; a collision between her luscious , freely applied color and her extraordinary gift for balance and order . " I never judge a picture unless it 's on the wall , " she says . " I am always adding or subtracting , adding a touch here or there , reworking a spot . I want my pictures to work in every millimeter . " The results have nearly always been unabashedly beautiful ? too beautiful , some critics have charged . Though she came of age in the macho world of action painting , Frankenthaler has never been afraid to talk about beauty . When she answers her critics , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't have to mean a gorgeousness , " she says . " The way I mean it , beauty is when it works , it moves me , it 's undeniable . " Any great picture in history has beauty , Frankenthaler maintains . And the deliberate bows to art history in her work go back at least to 1958 , when she painted " Las Mayas , " a tribute to Goya that you have to see upside down to understand . More recently she painted " For E.M. , " a stunning abstraction that was inspired by a Manet still life and has not been shown in public until now . ( She not only painted the picture but supplied the blurb ; the catalog quotes her as saying , " For E.M . ' is considered and formal , yet the spontaneity shines throughout . " ) A classic modernist , Frankenthaler is n't trendy with the downtown crowd , but history , she knows , will sort out art from fashion . When she speaks of her work she 's not shy about whose shoulders she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are about , she replies , " What can you say any painting is about ? What is Degas about ? What is Titian about ? What they all share is making very beautiful pictures that advance truth , beauty and pleasure . "
