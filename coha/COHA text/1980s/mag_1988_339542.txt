A woman lies in bed listening to Christmas songs , crooning to her husband about their children . Abruptly he leaps from her side , explains that he has hired a hit man to kill her and regrets the action , but that it is too late for her to do anything except flee . This does not make much sense , nor will most of what happens to the woman during the next two hours onstage , yet bolt she does . So begins what seems to be a years-long trek that brings her into contact with tacky game shows , corrupt charities , alcoholic despondency and mass murder-though it may be only a dream or therapeutic fantasy . <P> What matters in this new off-Broadway collaboration by writer Craig Lucas and director Norman Rene ( Three Postcards ) is not the literal truth but the beguilingly hallucinatory fashion in which one vision blends into another . In an age when absurdism is yesteryear 's avant-garde , a handful of American playwrights work this rowdy territory . Only Lucas and Rene understand how to make something beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
