Some people say that sports develop character . Others , more realistically , contend that sports simply reveal character . Nothing reveals character quite like giving a team of major league ballplayers a lot of postseason loot to divide among themselves and their allies . The Basic Agreement between the Players Association and management specifies that 60% of the gate receipts from the first four World Series games and from the first four of each league championship series makes up the players ' pool . Every player on a club 's roster from June 1 to the end of the regular season automatically receives a full share if his team qualifies for the pool . Only these players can attend a shares meeting and vote on who else will get full shares , partial shares and cash grants . // Last year the pool was $11,969,881 . Under baseball 's current allocation system , 36% of that went to the team that won the World Series , the Dodgers ; 27% to the team they beat , the A 's ; 25% was divided between the playoff losers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was divided between the four teams that finished second in each division ; and 2.5% was split four ways among the teams that finished third ( five ways in 1988 , because the Brewers and the Blue Jays tied in the American League East ) . How the Dodgers ' money was allocated was known only to the voting players and the commissioner 's office until the Dodgers beat the A 's 5-2 in Game 5 to win the Series . // As the winners celebrated in the Los Angeles locker room , relief pitcher Jesse Orosco yelled over to Todd Maulding , the Dodgers ' bullpen catcher , " Todd , what 's it feel like to be $108,000 richer ? " That was how Maulding , who makes $22,000 catching and pitching batting practice and warming up pitchers , found out that he had been cut in for a full share  --  worth $108,664.88  --  of the Dodgers ' postseason winnings. // Maulding ran to the dugout to find his wife , Beth , who was waiting for the clubhouse celebration to end . After that , Maulding does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could get drunk without drinking , " he says . " It was like hitting the lottery . " // On the advice of Mike Scioscia and Orel Hershiser , Maulding bought a three-bedroom , three-bathroom house in Rancho Cucamonga , a town 55 miles east of Dodger Stadium . " My wife and I refer to it as the 24-Man House , " says Maulding . " It 's the players ' money . This was a special gift from the players . " // Maulding was the grateful beneficiary of a share-and-share-alike mood when the players voted , but the Dodgers ' current second baseman , former Yankee Willie Randolph , has seen enough shares meetings during his 15-year career to be leery of the process . " You get to see who your friends are really quick , " says Randolph . " A lot of the younger players like to argue back and forth . Sometimes it 's humorous and you have fun with it . And sometimes you look across the room and go , ' Wow ! That 's cold ! ' " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get in Los Angeles at Series time . Guerrero had been with the Dodgers through three quarters of the 1988 season before being traded to St. Louis for pitcher John Tudor . Guerrero was voted a half share . Tudor , who pitched in nine games for the Dodgers , received a three-quarters share . " What ticked me off is they gave John Tudor more than they gave me , " says Guerrero . " A lot of them voted like that just because they 're  --   --  , because they did n't like me. " // O.K. , Pete , but how do you really feel ? " I told the Dodgers if you want your money back , I 'll give it back , " says Guerrero . " I 've got more than all you guys put together . " // The players on teams with a chance to finish third or higher in their division vote on shares in late September or early October and then submit a list to the commissioner 's office before the playoffs begin . The player representative runs the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands ; majority wins . " Actually , you do n't really vote , " says San Diego outfielder Tony Gwynn . " A guy says a name and a couple of guys say , ' Screw him , ' and a couple say , ' No , he deserves it . ' Whoever makes the loudest noise wins . " // " Ninety-five percent of it is cut and dry , " says Dodger player rep Dave Anderson . The tough decisions are what to do with players who were with a team part of the season , either bouncing back and forth between the bigs and the bushes or coming to or leaving the club as part of a trade . Typically , length of service will determine a share . If a rookie is up half the season , he will get a half share . // But as Guererro can attest , not always . In 1982 , Milwaukee acquired pitcher Don Sutton from the Astros in late August for the stretch run . Going into the final series of the regular season , against the Orioles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The players voted him a one-third share , just as they did pitchers Doc Medich and Pete Ladd , who had also joined the club in midseason . Before the final game against Baltimore , a game that would send the winner into the playoffs , several Brewers suggested to player rep Ted Simmons that if Sutton won the game , he should get a full share . Sutton pitched and Milwaukee won 10-2 . Sutton received a full share , much to the surprise of some of his teammates , who were not informed of the last-minute change . Which is to say nothing of how Medich and Ladd presumably felt . // Sutton followed rule No. 1 for getting a big share : It is better to be a one-day wonder in September than Player of the Month in April . " If you were only around in the first half , by September , well , out of sight , out of mind , " says Giants catcher Bob Brenly . " A lot of guys will say , ' To hell with him . ' " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postseason bucks : Play on more than one contender . He was with Toronto for three fifths of the season , was released by the Blue Jays and was picked up by San Francisco for its pennant drive . Brenly will receive partial shares from both teams . // There are no guaranteed rules for getting series shares for those who do n't play . " A player 's contribution to the club can actually be measured , " says Brenly . " It 's hard to measure the effect a clubhouse attendant or a batboy had . " And how many people can play a part in getting a team into the playoffs ? " Well , it seems like everyone , " says Randolph . " Years ago we had one trainer , and that was it . Now you have assistant trainers , strength coaches , conditioning coaches , masseurs , masseuses and everything . " // The Dodgers seem particularly specialized . One year they voted $500 to each of the three pilots who flew the club 's Electra jet . Other examples of postseason money voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1,000 to Kathleen Chapman , the widow of Ray Chapman , the Indians shortstop at the start of the season . Chapman died after being beaned by Yankee pitcher Carl Mays on Aug. 16. // ? The 1980 Phillies gave batboy Mark Andersen a one-eighth share , worth $4,336.63 . Andersen used the money to help pay for college , and he is now Philadelphia 's assistant trainer . // ? Groundskeeper Matty Schwab earned a full share from the 1962 pennant-winning Giants for turning the base paths in Candlestick Park into a quagmire and slowing down Maury Wills and the Dodgers in the three-game playoff that determined the league championship . // ? Robert Scanlon knew how to work both sides of the field . During the 1944 season he was the batboy for both the St. Louis Cardinals and the St. Louis Browns . When those teams met in the World Series , each voted Scanlon a grant of $500. // ? The alltime winner of Series shares  --  nonplayer division  --  almost certainly is the late Pete Sheehy . In the 59 years Sheehy was the clubhouse man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Series . // However , for every person who owes his house or his education to the World Series , there is another loudly declaiming the withered hearts of his teammates . No club has suffered as much damnation for its tightfistedness as the 1932 Cubs . In August of that season , with Chicago trailing St. Louis by six games , the Cubs bought former Yankee shortstop Mark Koenig from the Mission Reds of the Pacific Coast League . Chicago 's regular shortstop , Billy Jurges , had been shot in July in what The Sporting News termed " an episode of unrequited love . " Koenig batted .353 in 33 games and was instrumental in the Cubs overhauling the Cardinals . Chicago voted Koenig a half share . // The Cubs ' Series opponent was the Yankees , who were outraged when they heard of Chicago 's shabby treatment of their former teammate . Maddest of all was Babe Ruth . " Hey , Mark , " Ruth called over to Koenig before Game 1 , " who are those cheapskates you 're with ? " // Ruth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with insults flying back and forth . When the Babe came to bat in the fifth inning of the third game with the score tied 4-4 , the Cubs lined the top step of the dugout to taunt him . With Charlie Root pitching , the count went to 2 and 2 , and the bench jockeys were riding Ruth unmercifully . Ruth held up two fingers , signifying that he had another strike coming . This gesture , coupled with others he made during the at bat , was interpreted by a few at the time , and by many since , to be a brazen prediction by Ruth that he was going to hit the ball over the centerfield fence , which he did . So in part , the carving up of World Series shares contributed to one of baseball 's greatest legends . // In retrospect , the Cubs ' apparent stinginess is understandable . Koenig was with the team less than a third of the season . The Cubs , unlike the Yankees , were not perennial contenders , and the nation , baseball included , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonplayers  --  have been stiffed for reasons far less substantial . Even Koenig 's treatment at the hands of the Cubs does n't look all that bad in light of the fact that the same team gave nothing to Rogers Hornsby , Chicago 's manager for the first two thirds of the season . // " In Kansas City , they were always fighting , " says Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog , who managed the Royals in the late 1970s . " One year the Angels got Tony Solaita from us at the All-Star break , and the players did n't want to give him a share . I said , ' Why not ? ' And they said , ' Because he beat us a game . ' " // In 1985 the Dodgers toyed with the possibility of not giving any money to Steve Howe , the excellent lefthanded reliever who left the team in midseason with a substance abuse problem . Finally , they decided to give him a one-eighth share , but only after asking if they could send the check directly to Howe 's wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones who bust their butts , who hit and pitch and win games , that the money is not only theirs to divvy up but also theirs to keep . The Red Sox practiced some New England frugality in 1986 by scaling back on rewards to part-time players and nonplaying personnel . The grounds crew got nothing at all , and the clubhouse attendants were voted only half shares . " The way I saw it , " says Boston catcher Rich Gedman , the player rep in 1986 , " and the way most of us saw it , was the ball club was making a hell of a lot of money off us . We saw the money as two weeks ' salary for us , and the club should take care of its own people out of its own share . " But some Red Sox players objected to their teammates ' parsimony . Jim Rice , Steve Crawford and Bob Stanley reached into their own pockets to reward some of the overlooked club employees . // A lot of people assume that as salaries have escalated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five thousand dollars mean to a team with as many millionaires as the Dodgers ? " says Los Angeles catcher Rick Dempsey . Says Hall of Fame righthander Don Drysdale , " When we played , World Series checks meant something . Now all they do is screw up your taxes . " // Others think that the inflated playoff payoff has made the players stingier . " It 's different now , " says Oriole manager Frank Robinson . " We 're talking about big , big bucks now . I 've seen it get bitter . I 've seen long arguments . " // Says one member of the 1983 Phillies , who won the pennant that year , " We had guys arguing about every nickel and dime . Guys who were making a half-million dollars were trying to freeze clubhouse guys out of a grand . It was a disgrace . " // " In New York , it was vicious , " says Baltimore coach Elrod Hendricks , a catcher for the Yankees in 1976 and ' 77 . " We 'd bring up someone for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guys who were making the most money  --  Catfish Hunter , Thurman Munson , Graig Nettles , Ken Holtzman  --  would say , ' Screw him . ' I would sit back there and laugh . " // The ' 76 Yankees , the best team money could buy , voted not to give anything to the batboys . When it was announced that their Series opponent , the Reds , had given their batboys quarter shares , each worth $6,591 , the bighearted Yanks gave each of their kids $100. // In all likelihood , the mix of sinners and saints , the openhanded and the tightfisted , has been pretty constant over the years . The World Series might have seen one perfect game , but it is not likely ever to see a perfect shares meeting . " There is no way to do it perfectly , " says Dempsey . " There are not too many accountants playing baseball . "
