Many organizations devoted to the arts  --  and not a few corporations  --  are badly shaken by the transition from a founding father to a new generation of more practical managers . The changeover is always bumpier if the founder 's departure is forced . But rarely is the switch as onerous and nasty , or the repercussions so lingering , as in the boardroom battle that in 1986 ousted William Ball from San Francisco 's American Conservatory Theater . Even today , Ball 's successors seek to justify his removal by selling the theme of " renewal " to a still skeptical public . <P> When Ball founded A.C.T . in 1965 , one aim was to combine a training academy for actors with a professional performing troupe that would also serve as teachers . A second was to provide a major new entrant to the then burgeoning regional-theater movement . Those goals were met : the conservatory today trains 70 actors in an academically accredited , three-year program , and the company won a 1979 Tony Award for regional excellence . But an equal concern for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longevity , and that effort not only eventually doomed his tenure but nearly destroyed what he had built as well . A.C.T . remains burdened with debt , compounded by the prospect of up to $10 million in needed maintenance for its aging theater . Worse , judging by its current offerings , the company is artistically humdrum . <P> Underlying Ball 's embattled tenure was one of the central conflicts in the history of the regional movement . Is a city 's theater the actual building and the bureaucratic institution , and thus a public trust conventionally subject to accountability ? Or is the theater instead the work onstage , which rises or falls according to the individuality and vision of the company 's artistic leader ? Ball , who regarded the ouster of an artist by a board of directors as a kind of theft , stipulated when A.C.T . came to San Francisco that the local board must serve only as fund raisers , with scant say over what plays he chose , what actors he cast , or how he ran things . By the late 1970s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused , and ultimately they quit . <P> After the showdown , local and government support for A.C.T . dropped , and the company built up a $1.5 million deficit . In trying to close the gap , Ball increasingly favored small casts and minimal sets , leading to productions that seemed skimpy in the 1,396-seat Geary Theater , an ornately paneled and columned 1910 landmark where A.C.T . has played for more than two decades . Says Edward Hastings , a director since A.C.T . ' s inception and Ball 's successor as artistic director : " Bill 's obsession with the deficit took over from artistic considerations , and that was not healthy for the company , although there were some wonderful productions right up to the end .
