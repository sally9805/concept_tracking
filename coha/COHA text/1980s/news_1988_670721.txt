Suddenly , on fourth and long , the Senator ' s wife , Claudia , bounced out of the station ' s backdoor and announced a spontaneous schedule change . " Next stop , Archie Moore ' s ! " she said , referring to a popular Irish pub in New Haven famous locally for its Buffalo-style chicken wings. // Such is the spirit of the Weicker campaign these days . Energetic . Confident . Concerned but largely unshaken by a poll released by the University of Connecticut last week that showed that Attorney General Joseph I. Lieberman , a Democrat , had erased a wide gap and drawn even with Mr. Weicker , a Republican seeking a fourth term . <> <> Regains Lead in New Poll // In fact , Mr. Weicker ' s campaign manager , Jay F. Malcynsky , shrugged when he learned that the Senator had regained his lead over Mr. Lieberman , according to a poll released late today by Quinnipiac College in Hamden . Thirty-nine percent of the 621 registered voters polled from Oct. 17 to Oct. 25 said they supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieberman . Twenty-eight percent were undecided . The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points. // " It confirms some of the information we have in house , but the only poll we ' re interested in is on Nov. 8 , " Mr. Malcynsky said. // The Weicker campaign has increased its purchase of television time and , in a direct counterattack to Mr. Lieberman ' s strategy , has begun assailing the Democrat ' s attendance record in his years as a State Senator , his past support of tax increases and his acceptance of fees for speeches and articles he has written , three matters on which the Senator has frequently been criticized by the Attorney General. // This recent strategy change , however , is part of Mr. Weicker ' s media campaign and less noticeable on the road , where passers-by , Democrats as well as Republicans and unaffiliated voters , often greet the highly recognizable 6-foot-6-inch Senator with backslaps , handshakes and unusually heartfelt accolades. // " Senator Weicker - Nobody ' s Man But Your ' s ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from New Haven , as Mr. Weicker walked down Church Street to a Chamber of Commerce luncheon in that city today . " How ' s the campaign going ? You know , I don ' t believe those polls . " <> <> Not Running From Fight // Mr. Weicker does mention his new game plan at some campaign stops . At an 8 : 30 A.M. breakfast of the Bridgeport Business and Industry Association , he recited a litany of state tax increases that Mr. Lieberman , a New Haven resident , had supported while a State Senator . He noted the Democrat ' s previous support for a state income tax , a political anathema in Connecticut , and the challenger ' s 71 percent and 81 percent attendance records during the 1972 and 1973 sessions. // He also responds to Mr. Lieberman ' s campaign tactics whenever prodded by reporters . " I ' m not going to run away from any fight , no matter what shape that fight may take , " he said. // The tone of those remarks , though , make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feels as if he is lowering himself to Mr. Lieberman ' s level by sniping tit for tat over what he sees as dated , anomalous or nonsubstantive issues . " Anyone can play the negative game ; it doesn ' t take a genius to do it , " Mr. Weicker said . " But American politics does suffer when it happens . " <> <> Enthusiastic Campaigner // Rather than focusing on polls and the political horse race or strategies and negative tactics , Mr. Weicker throws himself into small talk-intensive person-to-person campaigning . At 20-minute stops at factory gates , ball-bearing plants , local Republican Party dinners , country fairs and crafts festivals , he hears stories about Social Security death benefits being denied , about the need for more drug-treatment centers. // As Mr. Weicker mingles , his staff often hands out blue rubber jar-grippers emblazoned with the Senator ' s name . " Did you know they are called rubber husbands ? " said Stephanie H. Sanchez , a 21-year-old volunteer from Greenwich. // To be sure , most political candidates say they enjoy shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this may or may not be true for Mr. Weicker , who maintained a smile , a high energy level , a clear focus , a firm handshake and at least the semblance of genuine interest today as he toured a Schick Safety Razor plant in Milford and the Moore Special Tool Company in Bridgeport. // Either way , he seems to do it well . His campaign stops on the day ' s 11-hour , 98-mile tour also included another radio taping in New Haven , an appearance on a radio talk show in New Haven , visits to the Pratt &; Whitney jet engine plant in North Haven and the American Cyanamid plastics plant in Wallingford . " I ' m doing what I have always done , " the Senator said . <> <> ' Nobody Does It Better ' // Other trips have included stops at Stew Leonard ' s dairy store in Norwalk and the Connecticut Packing Company food store in Bloomfield , as well as 7 A.M. arrivals to greet shipyard workers at the Electric Boat shipyard in Groton . He has also played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do it in spades , and nobody does it better , " said Mr. Weicker , who still carries a few specks of political stardust from his days on the Watergate Committee 15 years ago. // Indeed , the brash and burly Senator , a liberal Republican who has mirrored so well what the Almanac of American Politics once called the " taciturn contrariness " of the Connecticut Yankee , can arouse an unusual degree of enthusiasm in this otherwise stoic state. // After finishing a stop this afternoon at the Southern New England Telephone Company ' s headquarters in downtown New Haven , a visit in which he bought an " Alf " doll for charity , Mr. Weicker heard a loud rapping sound . He looked up at the outside of the nine-story building and saw employees , many of them women , pressing their faces up against the windows , tapping the glass and waving , almost as if they had spotted the President. //
