Chicago study renews the debate over boys'and girls'ability <P> It is well known that teen-age boys tend to do better at math than girls , that male high school students are more likely than their female counterparts to tackle advanced math courses like calculus , that virtually all the great mathematicians have been men . But why ? Are women born with less mathematical ability ? Or does society 's sexism slow their progress ? <P> <P> In 1980 two Johns Hopkins University researchers tried to settle the eternal nature/ nurture debate . Julian Stanley - who is well respected for his work with precocious math students of both sexes - and Camilla Benbow had tested 10,000 talented seventh-and eighth-graders between 1972 and 1979 . Using the Scholastic Aptitude Test , in which math questions are meant to measure ability rather than knowledge , they discovered distinct sex differences . While the verbal abilities of the males and females hardly differed , twice as many boys as girls scored over 500 ( on a scale of 200 to 800 ) on mathematical ability ; at the 700 level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : males have inherently superior mathematical reasoning ability . <P> Benbow and Stanley 's findings , which were published in Science , disturbed some men and not a few women . Now there is comfort for those people in a new study from the University of Chicago that suggests math is not , after all , a natural male domain . With Researcher Sharon Senk , Professor Zalman Usiskin , a specialist in high school mathematics curriculums and an author of several math texts , studied 1,366 tenth-graders . They were selected from geometry classes and tested on their ability to solve geometry proofs , a subject requiring both abstract reasoning and spatial ability . Says Usiskin : " If you 're a math whiz or a computer bug , you 're going to pick up equations and formulas that will help you with tests like the SAT . But geometry proof is never learned outside of school . " The conclusion reached by Usiskin and Senk : there are no sex differences in math ability . <P> The results of their study will be presented at this week 's meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a draft that has already been circulated , the Chicago researchers decided to take a few swipes at the recent Johns Hopkins findings . They argued that Benbow and Stanley had measured performance , not ability . Says Usiskin : " To assume that the SAT has no connection with experience is poppycock . " Replies Stanley , who now has 50,000 subjects to bolster his conclusion : " People are so eager not to believe that there is a difference in mathematical reasoning ability between boys and girls that all kinds of people are taking potshots . " <P> The Chicago study , says Stanley , is " irrelevant " because it tests knowledge of mathematics rather than raw ability . He points out that the students were receiving geometry instruction at the time of the test . " What they 've done , " says Stanley , " is to show that when you teach boys and girls together in math classes , the girls learn quite well , and we 've known that for 50 years .
