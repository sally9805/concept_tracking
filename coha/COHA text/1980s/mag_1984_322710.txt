MX survives again , barely <P> Assuming they are finally deployed as scheduled in 1986 , the first MX missiles are to be stored deep in underground silos , a basing mode that was chosen only after more than 30 other methods were considered . Politically , however , the MX ( for missile experimental ) program has long had a more precarious base : on the edge of a cliff . Beset by controversy through four Administrations , the weapon was saved from extinction by a bipartisan presidential commission a year ago and funded by a reluctant Congress , only after strong lobbying by Ronald Reagan . Last week a compromise proposal allowed the missile to escape , just barely , its most serious attack yet in the House . <P> The plan , which was put together by Democrat Les Aspin of Wisconsin , aims a carrot and stick at Moscow : money for the missiles will be held in escrow until next April . If the Soviets agree to resume talks on strategic arms limitations , the MX program will remain on hold . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion that the House Armed Services Committee had requested for 30 missiles was cut to $1.8 billion for 15 . <P> Reagan lobbied strongly for full funding of the MX , arguing that cancellation of the program would reward the Soviets for refusing to resume START talks , which have been inactive since last December . Referring to the MX by the nickname he prefers , the President said , " Without Peacekeeper , the incentive for the Soviets to return to the negotiating table is greatly reduced . " But by the weekend before the vote , Speaker Tip O'Neill , an MX opponent , boasted that he had a solid majority to scuttle the missile . Republican Leader Robert Michel then made a publicized pilgrimage to the White House to deliver the hard facts . <P> Actually , the White House legislative strategy group had already concluded that a compromise would be necessary and had worked behind the scenes with Aspin . After the narrow ( 218 to 212 ) defeat of an amendment that would have killed MX funding entirely , the White House endorsed the Aspin compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was less successful with another item in his $291 billion 1985 military budget . The House defeated , for the third year in a row , Reagan 's attempt to appropriate funds for a new generation of chemical weapons . The Senate Armed Services Committee , however , is expected this week to recommend the funding of 21 missiles and to give the President at least some money for chemical weapons ; the full Senate , in which Republicans have a majority , will probably go along . All of which means further compromises and cliffhangers are likely when House and Senate conferees sit down to work out their differences this summer .
