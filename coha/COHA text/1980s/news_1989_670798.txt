Announcing a 10-point plan to improve operations in the department , Mr. Watkins said what he called " tiger teams " of auditors would look at two other bomb production plants for violations of environmental laws like those said to have occurred at the Rocky Flats plant near Denver . Scores of Federal agents are investigating whether the workers in Colorado secretly dumped and burned radioactive and chemical wastes. // He also said that awards to the contractors who run the plants would be based primarily on environmental performance , not production quotas . The plan includes a public hot line for people to alert the department to problems . <> <> Unusually Blunt Language // In his most comprehensive comments yet on the nation ' s nuclear weapons industry , Mr. Watkins acknowledged , as his predecessor had , that the plants were in disrepair . But he dwelled heavily on the disarray within his department in language that was unusually blunt for a Cabinet secretary. // Alternating frustration with contrition , Mr. Watkins said , " I am certainly not proud or pleased with what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Referring to a production system whose major parts are at least 25 years old , some dating from the development of the atomic bomb , Mr. Watkins said , " The chickens have finally come home to roost , and years of inattention to changing standards and demands regarding to the environment , safety and health are vividly exposed to public examination , in fact , almost daily. " // Mr. Watkins , a retired admiral , said he would like to bring credibility to the department so that when it sought to open a new plant or operate an old one , the public would not feel the department was " jamming something down somebody ' s throat out there. " // But he said his efforts had been slowed because of an insufficient number of technically qualified people on the department ' s staff . And he said he was involving himself in every major decision because of unreliably optimistic information he was receiving. // " When I get the briefing , I only get one side , so I have to dig in myself , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data base coming to me that I need . I have omissions in the data base . So I am making decisions today on a crisis basis , and I don ' t like that . That ' s not my way of doing business. " // As he spoke , an influential environmental group , the Natural Resources Defense Council , released a study showing an even grimmer picture of environmental problems in the bomb plants , with 14 of the 17 major plants found to be in violation of hazardous waste laws. // The council and 20 other environmental groups filed suit today against the Department of Energy , seeking to foster a public debate about the cleanup and rebuilding of the bomb production system , by compelling the Government to prepare an environmental impact statement . <> <> ' We Are Not in Compliance ' // A spokesman for the department , Christina Sankey , said she could not confirm the number of plants with serious pollution problems but agreed , saying " We are not in compliance. " // Mr. Watkins said he was ordering a review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Environmental Policy Act , the law that calls for environmental impact statements , and that he was personally reviewing each decision on whether to order such a statement , which can entail substantial delay in a project. // But he refused to say whether he would order an environmental statement for the overhaul of the whole system of bomb production , a project that would take decades and may cost more than $100 billion . <> <> Rise in Cleanup Budget // He also said his department would get an additional $300 million in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 for cleanup . The Reagan Administration ' s budget called for $1. 8 billion , which was increased by President Bush to $2. 1 billion , and now to $2. 4 billion. // Mr. Watkins said he was surprised to learn last week that his department had ignored recommendations made by the National Academy of Sciences from 1983 to 1987 on the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad , N.M. The opening of the plant , which is meant for disposal of plutonium-contaminated wastes , has been delayed for months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , the department will ask the academy for its endorsement of a plan to open the repository . " They ' re going to tell us , I ' m sure , ' You didn ' t listen to us from ' 83 to ' 87 . ' " Mr. Watkins said. // He said the plant would not open until next year , a delay that create a crisis as wastes continue to pile up at temporary storage sites in Rocky Flats . <> <> ' A Nightmare for Me ' // Mr. Watkins said another waste disposal project , the plan to store highly radioactive wastes from military reactors and civilian ones at Yucca Mountain near Las Vegas , Nev. , had been hamstrung by shortcomings of the Energy Department staff . " It has been a nightmare for me to try to unravel the background sufficient to make some decision , " Mr. Watkins said . " It ' s been very confusing , and each day is revealed some new technical data. " // He said he had found " serious flaws " in the procedures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe to operate. // The department will have " an entirely new management team , " he said , under Victor Stello Jr. , now executive director for operations at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. // " Mr. Stello will assure that conformance to environmental laws and attention to these requirements are developed through a safety-conscious culture that will assure production objectives are met without violation of environmental , safety or health standards , " he said. // The White House has announced that it plans to nominate Mr. Stello as Assistant Secretary for defense programs , but opposition is expected in the Senate because of unorthodox procedures he used at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in approving cash payments to obtain information . The money was paid to a former utility employee who said he had information implicating a commission official in connection with allegations that have not been disclosed. // Mr. Watkins also said he had asked the academy to establish a committee on epidemiologic research to advise the department on ways to study worker health issues . The department plans to create a data base on the health histories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by outside researchers. //
