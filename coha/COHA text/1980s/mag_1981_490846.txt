THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment IF a government official were to announce that increased subsidies to agriculture would now " take the place " of food stamps , someone would be sure to ask what the two things had to do with one another and why it would n't be possible to have both . But when Secretary of State Alexander Haig told reporters at his first press conference since he assumed office that " international terrorism will take the place of human rights in our concern , because it is the ultimate abuse of human rights , " no one thought to ask why the government had to choose between them . Nor did anyone ask how , if international terrorism really was the worst of the human-rights abuses , you could speak of one taking the place of the other . A hint of what the new policy was going to mean in action came during the recent visit to Washington of President Chun Doo Hwan , of South Korea , the general who seized power a few weeks after his predecessor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter had held up important negotiations with South Korea on economic and military matters because of human-rights abuses there , but the Reagan Administration resumed the negotiations , and the State Department announced that hereafter the United States would not " go into the internal state of affairs in the Republic of Korea ; " at the same time , the Department asked Congress to postpone publication of a report on human rights which was said to contain information that would embarrass President Chun . The impression one gained was that the United States was lowering its concern about human rights not in order to fight terrorism better but in order to more firmly cement its ties with repressive right-wing regimes around the world . President Reagan did not do anything to clarify Administration policy when , in an appearance with President Chun at a White House luncheon , he remarked that Korean and American soldiers had fought together in Korea and again in Vietnam , where " the cause was freedom , " leaving one to wonder how there could be a crusade that was for freedom without also being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Vietnam War enjoyed no more freedom than South Korea does now , one has to assume that the freedom President Reagan had in mind was our own  --  a freedom we really do possess but are willing to defend , it seems , by supporting regimes that deny freedom to their own people . ( In his inaugural address , President Reagan , who has taken to claiming that God has a " divine plan " for the United States , said , " God intended for us to be free . " He did not add that God intended South Korea or Vietnam to be free . ) This policy is no novelty of the Reagan Administration  --  it has spanned many Administrations , and was only slightly disturbed by the Carter human-rights policy  --  and its cost to the United States has always been high . When the Soviet Union , a left-wing totalitarian nation , supports another left-wing totalitarian nation somewhere in the world , its action is consistent with its domestic policies and its beliefs . But when the United States , a constitutional democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or human rights , or liberty , or whatever you choose to call it  --  our reason for existing as a nation , and our mission , if we have one , in the world  --  goes unsupported and unspoken for in international affairs . Even though we may extend a network of arms all around the globe , freedom shrinks to a purely domestic matter  --  a sort of luxury , like our large gross national product , and one that is defended , but not enjoyed , by other peoples . Our foreign policy then becomes nothing more than a military shield , containing no reflection of the spirit of our country . One unfortunate consequence of this abdication of our beliefs on the international scene is that American protests against repression by the Soviets of their own people and others lose their force . ( It seems notable that Mr. Haig chose " international terrorism " as his target and did not even mention Soviet violations of human rights . ) But the greatest danger for the United States  --  one that came menacingly to life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually regard our political system , with its inefficient constitutional restraints and its inconvenient individual liberties , as an unnecessary obstacle in our grandiose global struggle for " freedom " ( but not " human rights " ) . There are already a few signs that our love of liberty is being construed as weakness toward our enemies . In a recent editorial , the Wall Street Journal remarked that " in the Carter Administration ' human rights ' were code words for a lurch toward accommodation of the international left . " The international left itself , of course , including , especially , the Soviet Union , regarded Carter 's human-rights program as a disguise for an anti-Soviet lurch toward the right . ( The Soviets were especially angry when Carter sent Andrei Sakharov a letter of support . ) Between these views , the actual substance of human rights gets interpreted out of existence . It is perhaps unsurprising that the Soviet Union and its friends should look upon American devotion to human rights as a cover for something else , but that we , too , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OIL/I . My favorite T adore ca , " V said Mrs. Oscar de la Renta . " It 's a divine dress , " said Mrs. Henry Kissinger . " Will there be caftans ? We do want caftans . " In a crowded showroom high above Seventh Avenue , a group of women sat , like ladies in all opera box plying their lorgnettes , and viewed Oscar de la Renta 's newest summer styles . Earlier , Mrs. de la Renta had greeted the women as they came rippling in on waves of mink and agitated sociability . She had kissed , patted , stroked , and introduced , while they had anxiously searched the backs of little red plush folding chairs for little white handwritten name cards . It was up to others to welcome representatives of the American fashion business ( " We shipped it ! We shipped it already ! " an employee told a buyer ) and to come up with a block of ten seats for representatives of the Japanese fashion business . Then , in quick succession , the models pranced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parakeets , and their earrings tinkled like wind chimes  --  to do their twirl in front of Mrs. de la Renta 's seat . At the center of her group , she sat at the head of the narrow aisle . On either side of its length , the other members of the audience sat , their faces swivelling in unison as models passed to and fro . Costly peasant-style flounces and skirts that ballooned like white swans below jewel-encrusted bodices brushed against the heavy folded coats and notebooks on buyers ' and reporters ' knees . Mrs. de la Rents fired off a stream of comments to her right and left . From time to time , out of excitement , she touched her neighbor 's manicured hand ( framed in the ruffles of Oscar de is Renta 's fall collection ) as it lay resting effortless on a tiny pocketbook . " Matisse , " said Mrs. de la Renta , nodding at a printed dress . " But you knew that , of course . " " I know how we can get that look for half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they sat in the second row and some way down the aisle . " Which do you think will make it to the White House ? " said a store executive to her assistant , where they sat next to the Japanese . Then it was over , and Mrs. de la Renta 's special guests were swept into the elevators along with the departing crowd . " I love you , and thankyou , " they said . " Thankyou , thankyou , thankyou , " she said , on her husband 's behalf . Down on the street , chauffeurs woke with a start and leaped to open doors of limousines , startling a man who had just set up the cardboard boxes for his three-card-monte game . fit the Palladium OUR music-loving friend Louise , who is in her mid-thirties and works for a historical society , owns all the records by Elvis Costello , the English rock star , and she attended his recent concert at the Palladium  --  the Palladium on East Fourteenth Street , not the one on Argyll Street , London . She called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounding more cheerful than she had sounded in months , and went on for several minutes : Well , what can I say ? You really should have come , too . It was the most electric concert I 've been to since I saw Dylan in 1965 , in Austin , Texas , and you know that I 'm not so wild about concerts . It occurred to me afterward that concerts are primarily exercises in adulation , and I guess I just have n't adulated anybody since then except Elvis Costello . Well , any-way , I got a No. 7 bus right away , so I got to Union Square about twenty minutes earlier than I ex-pected . I bet the owners of Liichow 's just hate the Palladium , because , from about Broadway to Third Avenue , Fourteenth Street looked like thugland  --  not serious thugland , I guess , but the vibes sure did n't seem warm and furry to me . Ticket scalpers in black leather , with greasy hair and shades . I heard ticket prices of thirty-five , fifty , and seventy-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But " And this is our breakfast nook , where the dawns come up like thunder . " who can he sure ? For all I know , these guys could have just been tall high-school kids taking a break from working on their science projects . Just the same , I did n't make eye contact with any of them . I went around to the stage door , on Thirteenth Street , to see if there were crowds of groupies and fans , like in " A Hard Day 's Night , " but there was only a line of about forty unglamorous people  --  they looked very bored or burned out  --  waiting to get in on backstage passes . Two beefy guys in sloppy T-shirts were in charge at the door , ordering the people to line up along the wall next to the sky-blue police sawhorses , and the way they spoke to them was sneery and condescending , to say the least . Willie Nelson had it right : " The night life ai n't a good life . " The closest thing to fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car fender . I went back around to the entrance , went in , and climbed four flights to my balcony seat . It was n't the Garden , at least . Nobody seems to realize that the Garden was built for Dr. J. , not Dr. John . No place to hear music . Fortunately , the people sitting around me were n't a hit thuggy . They reminded me of the student types who used to go to the old New Yorker Theatre  --  before it became the New Yorker 1 and 2 . The guy behind me was complaining to his girlfriend about the dilapidated condition of the Palladium . He was right . Tapestrylike wallpaper was ripped and peeling off the balcony walls , and the place could have used a paint job ; it looked generally scuzzy . Then the same guy went on about how beautiful the Beacon Theatre uptown was by contrast , how many concerts he once went to on a single evening several years before  --  it was three , I think : Traffic , Johnny Winter , and Hot Tuna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same age he was . The opening band was n't bad . It was Squeeze , also English , and had a wonderful reedy lead vocalist named Glenn Tilbrook . He bopped around the stage as far as he could without uprooting his guitar cord from its socket , and he kept shaking his cropped blond hair , and looked like somebody 's adorable kid brother . The band 's best number was called " How Long ? , " which got a lot of air play last fall as a disco song recorded by Lipps , Inc . Have you noticed , by the way , how the music on disco stations sounds more like R. &; B , lately ? Well , speaking of R. &; B. , Elvis and the Attractions  --  that 's his hand  --  finally came out , and the place became real tense . It was pretty terrific . Syncopated lights made the cymbals and the flat tops of the keyboards glow pink while the musicians were simultaneously bathed in chartreuse light . Then the colors would reverse or change to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elvis had on a boxy gray " Ocean 's 11 " - looking sports coat , slim black slacks , and horn-rimmed shades . lle looked like Joey Bishop doing an impersonation of Bobby Darin . He still plays a .. fazzmaster , an old Fender solid-body guitar that fell out of fashion years ago  --  and out of production last year . Now , because Elvis plays one , the Jazzrnaster is back in style , and every kid wants a used guitar like his . Elvis was stiff at first , but he eventually loosened up . He reminded me a little of Buddy Holly clips I 've seen . In fact , Elvis 's best songs have always struck me as the sophisticated , sexy , seventies and eighties descendants of Buddy Holly songs . Some people have told me they do n't like his adenoidal baritone , but he sang so expressively I do n't see how anyone would n't have been won over last night . I was on the edge of my seat for an hour and fifteen minutes . I felt like twenty ' again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flings back its blankets and emerges with startling purity and clarity . It returns to itself . It is quiet there , with only a murmur from the sea , and the sand , except for a few bottle tops and plastic combs , is clean . You can actually find unbroken seashells . And you can see the place . You feel you know where you are . One clear morning recently , we took our constitutional at Jones Beach . The air temperature was thirty-one , and low tide was expected at four-twenty-six . Several dozen people were enjoying the brisk , bright weather . At an aluminum picnic table on the Central Mall , a woman with a bottle of tanning lotion was sunning her face , and another woman was busy with a crossword puzzle . A man in a porkpie hat and a trenchcoat was pacing to keep warm as he waited for his cup of coffee to cool . A young man on a bench was playing a complex blues on a harmonica . Excited by the dazzling day and the feeling that the boardwalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did a few little numbers on the Perrier Parcourse Fitness Circuit  --  a series of eighteen fitness stops around the park where you can do Touch Toes , Knee Lifts , Jumping Jacks , Log Hops , and the like . They get progressively more difficult , and we gave up at the Body Curl ( a tricky manipulation on a slant board ) , but nearby a girl in a wheelchair was tilted back , balanced on her back wheels , and spinning for joy . Suddenly , a man saw this sign : NO FRIS BEES BALL PLAYING SKATEBOARDS He shouted , " No Frisbees ? What are they ? Communists ? " Then a man in a beaver hat with earflaps tied in a bow on the top of his head rushed up to a small girl and said breathlessly , " You can get to within ten feet of a seagull  --  I checked . " He clapped his hands . We walked a long way down the beach . It was a day for clear thoughts about space , and about spacing . Out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from each other . The dark islands of gulls looked like whales about to surface . High on the beach , above the tide marks , we found , in a few spots of melting snow , the footprints of Bigfoot , headed straight for the sea . He had been wearing shoes . Steadying ourself , we made a scientific observation : You can tell which way the wind has been blowing by examining the little sweep marks made by bent-over grasses in the sand . ( Northwest . ) Then we noticed a man with a metal detector some yards ahead and another man with a metal detector some yards behind . Almost immediately afterward , we found a 1975 nickel at our feet . Thomas Jefferson had turned green from the sea . We headed back to THE NEW YORKER the boardwalk , and at the Beach Shop we fell into conversation with Lorain Jackowski , who manages the string of fourteen Beach Shops at Jones Beach . The one at the Central Mall is open all year . She was sitting behind an enormous case of extravagantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Jones Beach . Lorain Jackowski is crazy about Jones Beach in the wintertime . She said , " It 's a misconception people have that the park is closed up tight from Labor Day to Memorial Day . We 're open all year . There are days when we have to shovel the snow away from the door , but we have to be here for the one or two people who might show up . I 've been here eleven years , and in all that time there have been only two or three days when no one came . It can be pouring , or a hailstorm  --  you name it . But even if only one person comes in , you feel it 's worthwhile to be here . After all these years , it 's kind of like my home . In the winter , you get the local people  --  some have been coming here regularly for five , ten , twenty years . Some of them come in to warm up and end up staying two or three hours . They pour out their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids , or their husband passed away . A man who just passed away two weeks ago came here every day for twenty years . For years , he brought me lollipops every Friday , red carnations on Saturday , and newspapers on Sunday . It was very quaint . Cute . Regardless of the weather , you knew he 'd be here . Sometimes he 'd make it in just to bring the lollipops . They used to call him the Boardwalk Superintendent . He 'd report on who was smoking pot . Little things , like children playing Frisbee , would annoy him . He took a lot of pride in the beach , and he wanted it to be perfect . Everybody would ask his advice . They 'd say ' What 's the weather ? ' and ' When 's the tide ? ' He would know the answer . We get a lot of people like that down here . Another man , in his eighties , comes down here once a week to jog on the boardwalk . He sometimes hitchhikes fifteen miles to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a ride home once , the weather was so bad . They call him Mr. Jones Beach . He 's a health-food freak , and he brings in freshly baked bread , but you have to eat it right away , because in twenty minutes it 's like a brick . It 's really nice here in the winter  --  really special . You develop friends down here . Some people bought a whale 's tooth from me , and now they come in a lot , and we go out to dinner . I like the hustle and bustle of summer , but I enjoy the people in the winter more . When the kites start flying in the spring , though , they leave . " At the Beach Shop , you can buy a Gayla Baby Bat keel-guided plastic kite , a frog poster , giant sunglasses , and whistle-hammers as well as plastic sharks and rubber lobsters . But the seashells there are like an exotic menu : Sea Pancake , four-ninety-five ; Pelican 's Feet , twenty-five cents ; Donkey Ear Abalone , seventy-five cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cowrie , a dollar ; Endive Murex , two-fifty ; Strawberry Tops , a dollar-fifty . We were hungry . At the Boardwalk Restaurant , after ordering broiled sea trout and Soave Classico Superiore , we gazed out at the ocean , pretending we were seeing the same uncomplicated expanse that Major Thomas Jones must have seen from his whaling station here , circa 1700 . But the tinted window of the restaurant dimmed the view , and the sky was awfully busy . Close to the window , seagulls swirled like snowflakes . Down the beach , a red-and-white kite imitated a tern 's suicidal plunge for a fish . Then a seaplane dashed across the foreground . Far out at sea , a dark island of gulls fluttered aloft for a moment . Two 747s in J.F.K. 's holding pattern were bracketing the sky . And a few clouds trespassed across the sun . The waitress said , " Guess what country you 'd be looking at if you could see that far . " " Spain ? " we ventured . " Nope . Everybody guesses Spain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
