Today the lawyer from Tucson , Ariz. , is one of hundreds in his field , as more and more lawyers spend most of their time representing older people. // " There have always been probate lawyers , estate-planning lawyers and general practitioners who write wills , " said Scott Severns , who practices what the specialists call " elder law " at Severns &; Lewis , an Indianapolis firm . " But now there ' s a recognition that as people live longer , they have a whole new era of legal needs . You don ' t just retire and die . " Nancy M. Coleman , head of the bar group ' s Commission on the Legal Problems of the Elderly , said there was no precise count of lawyers who practiced this new specialty . " But last fall we did a conference , and 500 people showed up , " she said . " Probably a third were private attorneys. " // // Interest in Older Clients // Mr. Bogutz , of Bogutz &; Gordon , has even founded a National Academy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its first conference this weekend at Tucson ' s Westward Look resort. // The legal profession ' s growing interest in older clients goes beyond the general awareness of America ' s aging population. // Experts say older people seek help for problems from age discrimination and guardianship abuse to issues involving home equity conversions , pensions and the right to die. // " Studies have shown that older people who feel they have a legal problem are more likely than younger people to seek out a lawyer , " said Wayne Moore , director of the Legal Counsel for the Elderly at the American Association of Retired Persons . " Now there are more problems and more tools. " // But the need for specialized lawyers is particularly keen among the increased numbers of Americans who are candidates for long-term health care . At nursing homes , such care can cost middle-class clients anywhere from $24 , 000 to $75 , 000 a year . Planning for it requires an understanding of what is available and of the complicated interplay between estate planning and Government benefits like Social Security , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate planning don ' t know benefits , and Legal Services attorneys who know benefits don ' t know estate planning , " Ms. Coleman said . " We need a new type of lawyer , a special type. " // So far , the emerging breed is found mostly at medium-size firms , in part because they can be flexible about staffing and services . " One thing that differentiates us from the usual trusts-and-estates attorneys is that our practice involves a lot of social work , " said Robert M. Freedman of Freedman &; Fish in New York . <> <> Managing Clients ' Assets // Bogutz &; Gordon has four lawyers and 16 other employees , including a psychiatric nurse who evaluates a client ' s needs for services and then follows up on any care . And Mr. Bogutz says much of his work for the elderly , about half of his total caseload , involves day-to-day management of clients ' financial assets . " We have people living at home who can ' t pay their bills on their own , can ' t get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not discuss fees . At Severns &; Lewis , Mr. Severns , 38 years old , and Margaret Lewis , who is 63 but did not graduate from law school until 1985 , are backed up by two legal assistants they consider " crucial " to the firm ' s ability to communicate with clients . Some clients just need to talk and " will call us at the drop of the hat , " Mr. Severns said . " In this kind of practice , you have to have someone to bill at a lower rate . " He and Ms. Lewis usually bill at $95 an hour , what he called " a typical fee for an experienced , small-firm lawyer in Indiana . " Representing older people , he said , is 90 percent of his practice which includes nursing home issues , support work with families of Alzheimer ' s disease victims , and the preparation of pamphlets on legal and financial planning. // Mr. Freedman said he often spoke to unions and medical groups about the legal needs of the elderly in addition to handling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he calls typical Manhattan prices : $150 to $200 an hour . The speeches and meetings " obviously get business , " he said , " but there ' s also a real commitment to getting the information out. " // Mr. Severns and Mr. Bogutz also meet regularly with legal and medical groups . " People who meet clients only in their offices are not going to do well in elder law , " Ms. Coleman said . " You ' ve got to make yourself accessible to older people by going to meetings where they might be . " <> <> Meeting Special Needs // Indeed , accessibility is at the center of the specialty . Lawyers in the field must be prepared to visit clients at home and be sensitive to the disabilities of those who visit the firm . Offices have to be accessible to wheelchairs . Computer printers must produce documents with large type . A firm ' s location should be selected with an eye toward easy parking. // The lawyers must also learn the art of interviewing clients who are hard of hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , avoids sitting in front of open windows and has " conducted entire legal interviews " by passing notes back and forth . Mr. Freedman recalled " conferences where I think I ' ve screamed for an hour and a half . " And all three lawyers say they avoid " leading questions " that result in yes-or-no nods from clients embarrassed about hearing loss. // Such sensitivities are more than just good manners . They are essential to maintaining ethical standards in a field that poses a variety of unusual challenges. // Ms. Coleman says lawyers in the field are often hired by families of older people , and there is confusion about exactly whom the lawyer represents . Similar issues are raised when an elderly client loses mental or physical powers : should the lawyer try to judge the client ' s best interests or do what the client wants ? <> <> Setting Ethical Standards // Mr. Bogutz says one goal of the academy is to set ethical and other standards for the new specialty . And Ms. Coleman says law schools should begin to do their part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 175 accredited institutions have separate courses in elder law , " she said. // Graduates who go into the field will not make Wall Street salaries , but elder-law lawyers say the specialty is lucrative enough . " It ' s not get-rich-quick , " said Mr. Severns . " But we ' re doing fine. " // And the practice offers young lawyers a glimpse of something else . " You get to know the family , the nearby nursing homes , the family ' s other needs , " said Mr. Freedman , whose office is in downtown Manhattan . " My father has a practice in a small town in Massachusetts , and in a lot of ways he relates to clients the same way I relate to mine. " //
