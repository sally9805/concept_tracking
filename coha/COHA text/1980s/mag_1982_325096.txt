A World 's Fair that exudes an air of friendly intimacy <P> Some great international expositions will always be remembered affectionately for their cultural flair and technical innovations . Others , particularly some recent , much ballyhooed U.S. fairs , have left only debts and deserted weed fields . Chances are good , however , that no one will knock the Knoxville fair , which opens this week and closes in October . <P> This hope is based on the ground 's advantageous valley location in the heart of the city , and the decision of smart planners to design the fair as a fair rather than a permanent mausoleum of grandiose ambitions . About half of its buildings are temporary and can be dismantled and their parts sold when the fair closes . Even the trees are planted in wire baskets for possible later transplanting . Yet none of this impermanence detracts from the fun , let alone the ingenious beautification of a site that was a messy , abandoned railroad yard when groundbreaking started a little more than two years ago . <P> The Knoxville International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great and important World 's Fairs . The first of these was held in 1851 in London , where 14,000 exhibitors displayed the wonders of a new industrial age . The greatest wonder of all was the Crystal Palace . Designed by Joseph Paxton , the palace introduced a new prefabricated architecture of glass , iron and wood . <P> The Paris World 's Fair of 1889 produced another herald of modern architectural engineering , Gustave Eiffel 's 1,010-ft. tower . Except for the first Ferris wheel , the World 's Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893 did not really advance structural engineering . But it was a dream of what the American city might be . Designed under the direction of Architect Daniel Burnham and Landscape Architect Frederick Law Olmsted , who also created New York 's Central Park , it helped inspire the monumental heart of Washington , D.C. , as well as public buildings from coast to coast . <P> Later World 's Fairs-St . Louis ( 1904 ) , San Francisco ( 1915 ) , Chicago ( 1933-34 ) , New York ( 1939-40 and 1964-65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and Osaka , Japan ( 1970 ) - never achieved the cultural and architectural importance of those early ones . Both New York fairs were gaudy happenings that turned architecture into a tool of advertising . The 1964-65 New York fair has left bizarre ghosts of its architectural arrogance , such as the Unisphere and the New York State Pavilion . Montreal 's Expo 67 , in contrast , leaves a pleasant memory of some fine buildings and a colorful environment inspired by the most beautiful fair in this century-the Swiss National Exposition at Lausanne in 1964 . Lausanne , a national fair , was an exemplary work of art , excitingly varied and yet harmonious . <P> Knoxville 's energy fair does not pretend to be in the same big league with the so-called universal expositions , which are classified by the Bureau of International Expositions , established in Paris in 1928 . Smaller fairs , such as Knoxville 's or the proposed 1984 fair in New Orleans , are categorized as " specialized " expositions and are devoted to one major theme . Exhibitors usually share large halls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
