Actually , I really did put my feet up at one point , " George Bush said last week by telephone from the White House . " I did it thinking , ' I 'll show ' em I really meant it to be a feet-up meeting . ' So I put my feet up on one of those round sofas that were bolted to the deck of the Gorky . Gorbachev and I were leaning over toward one another . There were no inhibitions . " <P> The President had been a little tentative going into such a highly charged superpower meeting , when the great Malta storm struck . But the outcome reassured the world and seemed to enhance Bush 's presidential stature . His reflections on his eight hours with the Soviet boss came over the telephone line like pages out of a good reporter 's notebook . <P> " Yes , I think I can trust Gorbachev , " Bush said . " I looked him in the eye , I appraised him . He was very determined . Yet there was a twinkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is doing . He has got a political feel . I could tell by the way he was laughing with us . A little wink now and then . He has a wonderful way of communicating with Westerners . I had the feeling that I could bring up any subject at all . <P> " We had quite an animated discussion about Western values vs. democratic values . I thought they were the same thing . But he interpreted our definition of Western values to mean that we were right and he was wrong . Whereas democratic values are what he has been working for . <P> " I told him there was one question that always kept coming up . What would happen if trouble developed inside the Soviet Union and they had to use force to put it down ? I said I always refused to answer such a hypothetical question , but Americans were asking it . He did not give a direct answer , but he strongly implied , ' Look , I 'm going to succeed . ' " <P> The drama of two men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animosity is one of the surprises that history deals up in this strange world . " The changes are so monumental . So different . But it did not seem overwhelming when we sat down . Two reasonable people sat down with their staffs . Even the contentious matters were brought up without rancor . When I first met him in Moscow when I was Vice President and brought up human rights , he grew very heated . This time he talked very rationally , not rancorously . <P> " I had the feeling that the way we clicked off our list of things that we wanted to accomplish did n't exactly disarm him , but it did show him that we were ready to move forward on a lot of things he wanted . He may have been pleased it was n't going to take hours to drag them out of us . <P> " There are always invisible barriers that come from the enormous differences between our societies . I am not naive enough to believe that all the problems will be solved . But I told him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that I never had favored this kind of meeting before but that I had changed my mind . I am going to keep the personal part of this going . I 'll find ways to contact him in a quiet fashion . I can write . I can call now . I 'm not going to become a pen pal , but we can communicate . "
