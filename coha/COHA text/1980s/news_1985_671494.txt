" What I discovered , " he said , " was that between 1955 and 1961 , CBS finished in first place every week , for something like 260 weeks in a row. " // That ' s CBS : while the network disagrees with Mr. Tartikoff ' s research and says there were a few gaps in that winning streak , the fact remains that for most of those six years , and in fact for the greater part of the last 30 years , CBS ' s broad base and unobtrusive manner have kept it ahead with the American audience . It has stayed No. 1 in the ratings for the last six consecutive seasons. // " Since I came here I ' ve only been in first place , " said Harvey Shephard , senior vice president of CBS Entertainment . " It ' s an image you have not only as a network , but I have as a programmer . It ' s important to me to preserve that image of CBS . It was important to William Paley , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It ' s something that ' s important to me . It ' s part of the American ethic. " // With the autumn season a few weeks away , Mr. Shephard said there " is no other way to describe it : there is great tension up here , a sense of challenge and excitement . It is far more exciting to face an opponent who represents a real threat . " The opponent he spoke of was NBC , which , according to some analysts , is for the first time in years in a position to steal first place . <> <> Not After ' Teeny-Boppers ' // CBS remains unshakable , however , in its belief that it knows how to win in television . Its view these days is that it holds the center of the television audience , and its perception of what constitutes the center is markedly different from that of its competitors : NBC and ABC see American television dominated by young viewers ; CBS sees a nation moving toward middle age and older. // " The general population is getting older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of research , " the concentration of affluence within the older age groups is growing and the baby-boom generation is entering its 40 ' s , and they are going toward CBS. " // " I don ' t think at any time will we be going after the teeny-bopper audience in a significant way , " said B. Donald Grant , president of CBS Entertainment . " Our thrust is in the adult audience. " // As a result , CBS has a paucity of youth-oriented programs . Even its new action detective series , " The Equalizer , " has a middle-aged hero. // The rest of the CBS schedule has five hours of new programming , including an entirely rebuilt Wednesday night . It includes " Stir Crazy , " a one-hour program taken from the comedy film that starred Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder ; " Charlie and Company , " with Flip Wilson trying to emulate Bill Cosby ' s success at communicating middle-class values in a changing world , and a comedy anthology program with George Burns as host . They will be followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Friday night , CBS will introduce a new version of " The Twilight Zone , " with a two-story format designed to appeal to younger viewers in the first half-hour and a more sophisticated audience in the second . <> <> Advertisers Unworried // Despite the introduction of new programming , some of which , like the comedy anthology program , is considered risky , there is little worry even in the supremely critical world of advertising . " Because CBS is tried and true , " said Philip Burrell , an executive with the advertising agency Dancer , Fitzerald , Sample , " there ' s not that much to talk about . People will just watch their programs as they have . CBS has almost always done things right , and they haven ' t felt the need to merchandise themselves the way the others do. " // Like the other networks , however , CBS is having to adapt to an entertainment environment . In addition to independent broadcasters , the networks have to compete with cable and , increasingly , video cassettes. // But though cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is growing , network television , which produces 66 hours of advertiser-supported evening entertainment each week , remains the dominant entertainment in American life. // Last year , according to the A. C. Nielsen Company , television was watched by 222 million Americans , 98 percent of the nation . Each household had its set on for an average of 7 hours and 8 minutes a day , and 77 percent of those hours were devoted to programming on the three networks . For providing the programming advertisers believed most people wanted to watch , the networks generated more than $1 billion in profit , the largest share going to CBS . <> <> A Different Audience // CBS acknowledges NBC ' s improved position . " NBC is sort of part of the ' Rocky ' syndrome , " Mr. Shephard said . " It ' s the idea that when a network has been No. 1 as long as CBS has , it ' s - boring already. " // CBS has had to hold on to first place by gearing its programming to an audience that is slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of other the other networks . " We have always gone for a balanced audience , " said Mr. Shephard . " This country is getting older , people are working longer. " // Mr. Poltrack , the CBS research executive , called assertions that NBC has an upscale , geographically more desirable audience " just not true. " // " We are the leader in households in which the income is $40 , 000 and up , " he said . " Our audience is every bit as affluent . And when it comes to the urban-versus-rural skew , our audience doesn ' t skew toward rural areas . It skews toward non-urban areas , including suburban areas. // " The baby-boomers are moving to the older end of the demographics , and the younger viewers that existed are moving into their 30 ' s and 40 ' s . The buying power is shifting to older , and they are purchasing more things. " // Sunday night is the agreed-upon crucial night of the week : both NBC and CBS say that if NBC is going to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ruled the night for years through the staying power of " 60 Minutes , " and last year - with the kind of aggressive scheduling that has kept the network in first place - it added , in sequence , " Murder She Wrote , " with Angela Lansbury as a middle-aged mystery writer who solves murders committed by guest stars , and " Crazy Like a Fox , " with Jack Warden as a middle-aged private detective and John Rubinstein as his son . The network ' s evening is filled out by " Trapper John , M.D. " // NBC is going straight for " Murder She Wrote " and CBS ' s middle-aged audience with Steven Spielberg ' s " Amazing Stories " and the new anthology version of " Alfred Hitchcock Presents. " // ABC , which does not acknowledge Sunday night as crucial to its plans , is continuing " Ripley ' s Believe It or Not " and adding a new program called " McGyver , " about a man who gets out of perilous situations by using homespun science. // In 1955 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attention of the 10 million television sets then in the nation ' s homes , its logo - the black and white wide-open eye - introduced " The Jack Benny Show , " " I Love Lucy , " " General Electric Theater " with host Ronald Reagan , and " The Ed Sullivan Show. " // " That was because William Paley was only interested in programming , " Michael Dann , a former head of programming at CBS who now consults for ABC , said of CBS ' s founder . " To Paley , there was no such thing as worrying about affiliates or sales or the picture . The programming was everything . If the play was right that was all that counted . That was the philosophy of the network. " // " Sometimes people say there was a golden age of television , " said Mr. Grant , of CBS Entertainment . " You should go back and look at some of those programs . There was no golden age . The golden age in television is now . Each year the quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now , and 20 years from now , it will be then. " //
