Judge Anthony Kennedy , the Supreme Court nominee du jour , is , according to Senator Joseph Biden , in the " conservative mainstream . " The New York Times headlined him as a " Conservative Who Has an Open Mind . " Both Republicans and Democrats predict that he will be " easily confirmed . " According to Audrey Feinberg , an attorney who testified before the Judiciary Committee on behalf of Supreme Court Watch , a project of The Nation Institute , Judge Kennedy 's decisions in the civil rights and civil liberties area " raise serious concerns about his commitment to protecting constitutional rights , particularly his discrimination decisions , which reveal insensitivity to women and minorities . " Feinberg pointed out that Judge Kennedy had joined a dissent to a decision denying an airline the right to impose weight requirements on female flight attendants based on a presumed passenger preference for slender women . He joined in an opinion , since vacated by the Supreme Court at the request of the Solicitor General , upholding the firing of a homosexual from his Federal job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has rejected employees ' claims of comparable worth , decided against Mexican-Americans who charged that their city 's at-large council elections abridged their voting rights and denied judicial access to an organization that opposed racial discrimination in housing . Where is it written that during a Republican President 's last year in office , when the High Court is divided 4 to 4 on key civil rights and civil liberties issues , a Democratic Senate ( elected in 1986 ) should grant a presumption in favor of confirming a nominee who , by common consent , will probably tip the balance to the conservative side ? Is this the way to discharge the duty to advise and consent ? JACKSON AND THE LEFT IS JESSE THE GREAT WHITE HOPE ? ANDREW KOPKIND As campaign flaps go this year , Jesse Jackson 's twenty-four-hour misunderstanding with white social democrats last month should rate only an asterisk to a footnote in a scandal-ridden season . - No questions of adultery , bastardy , plagiarism , homosexuality , misappropriation of funds , drug abuse or dirty tricks were raised . In fact , the fuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is curious because it was a media-generated story . What happened , for the record , is that New York Times reporter Michael Oreskes wrote a story , buried deep in the bowels of the paper , that asserted- that Jackson had asked the Democratic Socialists of America  --  identified by Oreskes as " the nation 's leading Socialist organization " ? to withhold its expected endorsement of his candidacy on the eve of D.S.A. 's national convention . Oreskes , a solid city-side reporter who had recently co-written an unsettling pop psychology profile of Jackson in the Sunday New York Times Magazine , never quoted Jackson about D.S.A. but made the most of a conversation with the campaign 's new manager , Gerald Austin . " We want everybody 's help , but we do n't need- everybody endorsing ; " Austin remarked via Oreskes . Appended to the endorsement story ( " Jack-son to Shun Socialist Backing " ) was Oreskes 's short list of Jackson 's betrayals of the left : ( 1 ) Jackson recently refused to repeat a remark he had made at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Puerto Rico with the black struggle against apartheid in South Africa ; ( 2 ) he did not promise immediate deflagging of Kuwaiti tankers ( Continued on Page 790 ) A New Hart Show ast August we reported the results of a Nation/Gallup Gallup poll showing that if Gary Hart re- entered the race for the Democratic presidential nomination he would lead his closest rival by an almost 2-to-1 margin see Victor Navasky , " The Hart Poll , " August 15/22 , 1987 . At that time we wrote that Hart had missed an important opportunity to run a candid , yes , existential campaign . We said if he was prepared to confess all and run not expecting to win , he would be in a position to raise issues never before touched on in a presidential race . In a country where 40 percent of all married people are said to have confessed to infidelity , it did not surprise us that many Democrats did not regard Hart 's interlude with Donna Rice as a disqualification for the presidency . Now that he is back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so he would have to begin by speaking with utter honesty . To as-sist in such an effort , Andrew Kopkind has written a campaign speech for him : My name is Gary Hartpence . I am 50 years old . Like many men and women of my generation , I am an adulterer . Like most of my younger supporters , I have smoked marijuana , listened to raunchy rock lyrics and partied like it was 1999 . None of that is anybody 's business but my own , and I do ' not apologize for it now . I do not consider my behavior sinful in any but a narrow theological or pointless legalistic sense , but I do believe that it raises real questions of morality that I have not yet honestly addressed . Now it is time for a change . I have renewed my campaign for several reasons . In ascending order of importance they are : ( 1 ) to qualify for $900,000 in Federal matching funds already due me as of last May ( so that I may retire past debts ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a campaign I helped design and which still expresses an important part of my identity ; , ( 3 ) to make a bona fide attempt to win the Democratic nomination and the general election eleven months from now ; ( 4 ) to rid electoralpolitics of the hypocrisy , mythomania and cynicism that were my own undoing and substitute a radically different system , based on the inextricable values of personal responsibility and political integrity , which is the legacy of my generation . The history of my presidential campaign  --  from its roots in the antiwar movement of the 1960s until today  --  gives me a unique opportunity to transform politics in 1988 . In every instance it is absolutely crucial to attack the outmoded myths that constrict and deform honest political expression , but at the same time I must be true to those values I would put in their place . I do not espouse them to win ; winning is not the only thing . I urge them because they are true . It is a myth that America 's leaders must conform to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familial devotion . It forces candidates  --  it forced me  --  to lie about our lives , our loves , our beliefs , our strengths and our weaknesses . It makes us schlep our spouses all around the country for the sake of appearances , against their wishes if not their wills . The ideal President is not , as one of my friends once said , a " white Bill Cosby . " There is still time for Americans to learn to distinguish political reality from situation comedy . The tyranny of TV imagery made me ashamed of my unwieldy name , my creeping middle age and my somewhat fissioned home life . It makes Ronald Reagan dye his hair , it makes George Bush pretend to machismo , it makes Michael Dukakis hire P.R . specialists to give him " vision . " Truth is indivisible on the hustings as in the home ; we can not lie about ourselves and tell the truth about our politics . My comrades in the great popular cause that fed the McCarthy and McGovern campaigns used to say that " the personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become a theme of my own campaign in the months to come . Now I must apply the point to my own behavior . I have suggested to you today that I do not consider love or sex outside marriage to be sinful . To take a historical example , I respect Franklin Roosevelt 's long liaison with Lucy Page Mercer and Eleanor Roosevelt 's similar association with Lorena Hickok , and I do not believe that those mythoclastic relationships diminished for a-minute the greatness of their individual leadership . The struggle for personal liberation in the past two decades has given moral legitimacy to such behavior in private life , and only the old myths still drench public life with destructive hypocrisy . But I can not excuse my own relationship with Donna Rice as an exercise in sexual liberation . It was the very opposite of that : a good ol ' boy , sexist power trip that cruelly made a bimbo of a young , vulnerable woman and betrayed the values of sexual equality , openness and commitment that I have honored in all the generational appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not spring break in Fort Lauderdale or bedroom frolics in the Kennedy White House . I should have been different from that . My personal behavior had important political consequences , not in the way the pundits put it but in its implicit denial of the " new values " I have pledged to bring to politics . From now on , I will raise at every opportunity the real moral issues of our time  --  not in the repressive manner of Pat Robertson or Tipper Gore but in consonance with the way people live and the problems they have . Morality can not be considered without politics , and moral judgments have policy implications . We must look at ourselves as we are , not as a fundamentalist preacher wants us to be . Thus we must have legislation that accepts the fact that half of all marriages end in divorce , that women will work in increasing numbers , that domestic violence is the leading cause of injury to young adult women , that society has a responsibility to care for its children , that abortion is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be foisted on the secular community . I will talk about our compromised and corrupt political process in terms that no candidate now dares to use . When we practiced " peace politics " twenty years ago we expressed as best we could the needs and demands of our base . Politics today is about the concessions we make to corporate contributors , to media barons , to the Israel lobby  --  all in the hope that they will pour in dollars and confer endorsements . We can not be true to our principles and cater only to the rich and powerful elites . I said in New Hampshire on December 15 , " Let the people decide . " Our generation will recognize those words as the slogan of the radical student movement of the early 1960s . The allusion was deliberate , and I meant what I said . Christmases Past B uying his Christmas tree , a friend remembered visiting Cairo during the holiday of Korban Biram , which commemorates the commitment that Abraham , the " first Moslem , " made to God by sacrificing a ram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sacred and yet cheerful family holiday . Many streets are strung with colored lights . The children wear new clothes and flourish toy drums or ride a street fair merry-go-round rotated by a donkey . What particularly sparked his memory was the sight of paddle-tailed sheep tethered for sale all around Cairo , and city men in suits and fellaheen in galabias carrying these home on their shoulders , much as he would lug his balsam fir . Christmas trees go back to medieval Germany , not as far as Abraham . But the smell of fir itself sets off reverberations in our friend that he claims predate even the Prophets . Especially when he has been living in the city for a while , sensuous recollections of the woods are thrown into the front of his mind  --  not only places where he has summered happily but murkier hints of whole eons spent on all fours . In fact he was n't really carrying this tree . He was walking gingerly , steering the butt of it with one hand , watching for traffic , while his wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hernia operation , necessitated ( his doctor said ) because people now walk on two legs instead of four and our bodies have n't finished adjusting to the physics of this change . But he remembered the joy of Cairo strung with lights , and the cymbals of the hawkers for the merry-go-round  --  then cutting his own fir or pine , other winters , out in the country , with his parents and grandparents , now dead , along . Hefting it home had much enhanced their sense of family pride . In Egypt government agricultural experts complain that because people insist on carrying away the very best livestock for Korban Biram feasts , the quality of the nation 's herds is depleted . Economy comes second during a holiday . Most of us do n't calculate our bank balance with any nicety until January .

Dozens of Palestinians have been killed or wounded in shootings arising from a wave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No end was in sight as this issue went to press , and nobody seemed to be in a mood to talk  --  except with bullets or stones . Amos Kenan offers these observatiohs on the developing conflict . A t Tel Aviv University , in the mathematics department , there are more Arab than Jewish students . In the general population , sixteen Jewish and seventeen Arab students per 1,000 go on to higher education . Professor Moshe Many , president of Tel Aviv University , said on television a year ago that education-wise , the Palestinians have become our Jews , and we Jews have become their Palestinians . Why do Israeli Arabs fill the universities ? Because , they have no right to serve in the Israeli Defense Force . At the age of 21 , when an average Israeli Jew , ' after three years in the army , becomes a student , his Arab counterpart , deprived of equality , assumes superiority , having already earned his B.A. While riots are today swamping the occupied territories , cities and refugee camps from Nablus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of the Israeli-Palestinian paradox . The facts and scenes of recent riots are public knowledge . Youngsters and children throw stones and Molotov cocktails at Israeli cars and people . Jewish families have been burned to death . Jews were slain in the markets of Gaza and other Arab towns . Burning tires are a ' daily sight . Pocketknives have become the most efficient weapon of Palestinian resistance , or terrorism , depending on which side is talking . One of the most recent victims of a pocket , knife was an Israeli reserve soldier , in his forties , a sworn peacenik and member of a peacenik kibbutz . Ironic . As was the slaughter in Larnaka , Cyprus , of an active member of Peace Now by Force 17 , a guerrilla unit directed by AI Fatah . Then came the Israeli reprisals . Soldiers shot and killed demonstrators , some of " them schoolchildren , college students , women . Curfews , arrests , torture , deportation , sus- pects ' houses blown up and so on . All those facts , sights , are fixtures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The message is : violence . Palestinian violence : Will it drive Israelis into the sea ? Or will it force Israel to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization on the subjects of legitimate rights , statehood  --  in the West Bank and Gaza  --  and peace ? There is no clear , straightforward Palestinian answer and choice , no Palestinian consensus . The clause concerning the annihilation of Israel remains in the Palestinian covenant . Israeli violence : Will it drive all the Palestinians into the desert ? Or will it convince them , once and for all , that Israel , a Jewish state by definition , will occupy forever the entire territory of Palestine and so they had better give up any further struggle . As for statehood  --  let them declare the Kingdom of Jordan a Palestinian republic . Nonviolence : It is supported by a tiny minority on each side . Regarding the events in Gaza , Israelis speak in three official languages and use three kinds of semantics : ? Shamir language , which says , No partition of Eretz Israel . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then there is Shamir semantics : It 's only a tiny group of agitators . The Arabs are forced by terrorist intimidation and encouraged by Jewish defeatists , like Peres . ? Peres language , which says , It 's because of the political dead end imposed by Shamir . Let 's go to an international conference and talk peace with the P.L.O . excluded . Meanwhile , let 's not settle in the very heart of the Palestinian population . And Peres-Rabin semantics : Awaiting a political solution , we punish only the guilty . As for personal punishment , we are more decisive and effective than Shamir 's people . We blew up more houses than they did , deported more agitators . All we want to do is maintain order and prevent riots , while waiting for a political opening . ? Military authorities language and semantics : We shoot only when our lives are in danger . We are not political . We assure the security of Israel and the Israeli-ruled territories . Psychological effects : Right-wingers demand the death penalty for murderers ? Arab murderers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot to death an Arab schoolgirl ? Or the Jewish underground members who murdered Arab students and maimed Arab mayors ? Will Israel become racist ; meting out the death penalty only to Arab killers ? A sad example was provided recently when a military court acquitted a soldier who shot and killed an Arab , saying he acted - " automatically . " The current round of violence was sparked when an Israeli Army truck struck and killed four Arabs near Gaza . Immediately , the rumor spread that this was intended as revenge for the earlier killing of a Jew in Gaza 's main square . The rumor was believed , and brought immediate riot . A few months earlier , an Arab taxi driver had run over a few Israeli soldiers and was then shot to death . It was first claimed that the driver had acted intentionally . Further investigation proved this assumption wrong . Nonviolence : Mubarak Awad , head of the Palestinian Center for the Study of Nonviolence in Jerusalem , is stillthreatened with deportation . Ironically , Israeli violence against Palestinian nonviolence has fomented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon among-Palestinians , in spite of Awad 's efforts . Now , it 's even less so . Conclusion ? None . Things could be better only because they can not be worse . Or ca n't they ? It is not impossible that , as a result of despair and a dead end on both sides , a further war will wipe out the whole population of the region . The weapons for such a slaughter now exist . Amos KENAN Amos Kenan is an Israeli novelist and a columnist for Yediot Aharonot . I 'm still trying to absorb the news from Tibet that a couple of Chinese soldiers there tried to rip a Sergeant Bilko T-shirt off a British tourist because they mistook Bilko for the Dalai Lama . It may be too much for me . Let 's leave aside for a moment the ? possibility that the late Phil Silvers , the ALA old Borscht Belt comic who played the conniving Sergeant Bilko in the 1950s sitcom , was what they call in the trade a Buddhist demigod look-alike . Let 's leave aside the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told by the Chinese ' occupation force to forget about the Dalai Lama , would show their defiance not by chanting the Dalai Lama 's name or by praying publicly for his return but by putting his face on a T-shirt , as if he were Sting or Oliver North . Before we get to any of that , you have to wonder why a British tourist was wearing a Sergeant Bilko T-shirt in the first place . When was the last time you saw a Sergeant Bilko T-shirt on the beach at Biloxi or Lake Okoboji ? At first I thought the offending shirt might be part of the European rage for whatever it is that Asian manufacturers think American teen-agers wear  --  those weird sweatshirts that have emblazoned on them things like " U.S.A. Basketball Team Person " or " Akron Club of Surfers . " Maybe , I figured , some smoothies from Taiwan fobbed off a load of Phil Silvers T-shirts on the English with assurances that he 's the latest heartthrob in the Hollywood brat pack . Not so . According to one newspaper that reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ended its American network run in 1959 , has been in late-night reruns on British television and Silvers has become a sort of posthumous cult figure throughout Great Britain . This brings up a phenomenon I had never considered : the staying power of sitcom reruns . These things have the half-life of strontium 90 or a plastic shampoo bottle ; they last just short of forever . It occurred to me that this phenomenon is probably repeated all over the world . Sitcoms you forgot about a long time ago are running in countries you 've barely heard of . For all we know , people in Rwanda are boring one another silly with jokes from The Beverly Hillbillies . Settlers on the Australian outback may think of the United States basically as the home of Ozzie Nelson . - So it 's perfectly natural for a British subject to be wearing a Sergeant Bilko T-shirt . It 's understandable that the Chinese soldiers do n't know who Bilko is , because they 're from , say , Nanking , where all you can get at 3 or 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Beaver and 1969 episodes of The Newlywed Game . It 's also understandable that the Chinese soldiers do n't know precisely what the Dalai Lama looks like . He 's banned in China , after all , so they 've never seen a picture of him . If my experience in the Army is any guide , the only description they have of him wag furnished by the sergeant who makes announcements at reveille formation every morning  --  a description that probably does n't go beyond " there 's this bald guy who looks dangerous . " To Chinese soldiers , apparently , all bald guys look alike . Once I realized that , I realized that Mayor Edward Koch , who made a good-will trip to China a few years ago , was lucky to complete his visit without getting tossed in the slammer by mistake . No wonder Dean Rusk would n't go to China . Could that be why Gorbachev has that little mark on his head  --  to distinguish himself from Phil Silvers ? Of course not . I 'm getting confused . Being Phil Silvers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dalai Lama that wo n't do . But does that mean that someone who walked into Phil Silvers 's old neighborhood in Brooklyn wearing a Dalai Lama T-shirt would risk having it ripped off ? Probably . They might also take his shoes , but that does n't have anything to do with which sitcom reruns they 're , watching . Which is a good point : Which sitcom reruns are they watching in Tibet ? Could the Dalai Lama actually sneak back into his country and rally his people against the Chinese if he was willing to disguise himself as Desi Arnaz ? I 'm just trying to imagine the Dalai Lama doing a Cuban accent . It 's not a combination that was meant to be . None of this was meant to be . Somehow I 've accepted the fact of Tibet being occupied by . the Chinese , but I have trouble accepting the prospect of Tibet being invaded by The Brady , Bunch . I do n't think I can absorb any of this . Ever .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
