Most of the remaining growth was in the South Atlantic states , the Southwest and the Rocky Mountain states . The estimates show the nation has gained about 11 million people in the five-year period and now has a population of about 237 million , a growth rate of about 1 percent a year. // Population losses were most severe in the farm belt of the Middle West , because of the depressed agricultural economy , and in some old industrial cities that have not recovered from plant closings. // The Middle Atlantic region , composed of New York , New Jersey and Pennsylvania , showed a marked improvement from the 1970 ' s . New York , which lost 683 , 000 people in the 1970 ' s , showed a gain of 119 , 000 people since 1980 , to 17. 7 million , virtually all outside New York City , which remained static . Both New Jersey and Pennsylvania had larger gains than in the last decade . New Jersey gained 145 , 000 people over the five-year period , for a total population of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a total population of 11. 9 million. // // Continuing Shift of Power // If the regional shifts of the past five years continued for the remainder of the decade - with Northern states making only marginal gains and those in the West and South growing above the national average - there would be a continuing shift of political power away from the old Industrial and Farm Belts to the growing Sun Belt states , in both Congressional seats and votes in the Electoral College , where Presidential elections are decided. // The Northeast and Middle West lost 17 seats in the House of Representatives to the South and West as a result of reapportionment after the 1980 census. // In every region , the greatest growth appears to be taking place in areas around the big-city suburbs and in small metropolitan areas , although in Florida , Texas and California even many of the once-remote rural places are filling in , said John D. Kasarda , chairman of the sociology department of the University of North Carolina , who has written extensively on population movements. // " What we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is continued deconcentration of the population , with people moving from the cities and old suburbs into the outer suburbs and exurban areas , " he said . " And it is a pattern that is likely to continue due to the penchant of Americans for deconcentrated living . " <> <> Losses in Some Big Cities // At the same time , however , he said a number of old cities like New York had checked their losses by adding to their base as centers of finance , culture and tourism. // Of the big cities , Detroit , Cleveland , Baltimore , Philadelphia , Boston , Seattle and Milwaukee were still losing population , though at a lesser rate than they did from 1970 to 1980 . New York and Chicago , each of which lost 10 percent of their residents in the 1970 ' s , now have about the same number of people that they did in 1980 . Most cities in the Southwest are continuing to grow. // Once every 10 years , the Census Bureau conducts a count of residents of every community in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities , counties and states . The middle-decade estimates now available include Census Bureau calculations through 1984 and estimates to Jan. 1 , 1985 , made by Donnelley Marketing Information Services of Dun &; Bradstreet , which uses Census Bureau methods and some of its own. // Joseph W. Duncan , economist and chief statistician for Dun &; Bradstreet and former director of the Office of Federal Statistical Policy and Standards in Washington , said his company ' s estimates have conformed closely with those of the Census Bureau in the past. // " All are subject to error , " he said , " but there is no question about the accuracy of the trends they show . " The Big Three Probably the most impressive showing of the new estimates is the continued ability of Texas , California and Florida to draw Americans from other regions to settle within their borders . All have minority populations with higher birth rates than the national average that boost their numbers somewhat , but their populations are swelled largely by immigrants from other states and abroad. // Florida , which grew by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 million , is experiencing one of the biggest development booms in its history , based on continued growth of its retirement communities , international trade and finance in Miami , establishment of high-technology industries in the Tampa and Orlando areas and the spread of recreational areas along the Gulf Coast. // None of Florida ' s 67 counties has experienced a population loss since 1980 , and 51 of them grew by more than 10 percent . Growth rates in excess of 30 percent , six times the national average , were common. // Growth in Texas , which has fewer natural amenities and which has suffered a decline in its petroleum industry , was even more impressive , thanks to gains in other industries , including electronics . Texas added 2. 2 million people , for a growth rate of 15. 2 percent , highest of any state with a population of more than one million . It now has 16. 4 million people , and if the 1980-85 growth patterns continue for the rest of this decade it will surpass New York as the nation ' s second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have lost population , but the growth has been spread over large areas : in its cities , suburbs and the wide open spaces in between , from the Rio Grande to the Oklahoma border . <> <> Rapid Growth in California // California , which now receives more foreign immigrants than any other state and continues to draw Americans from other states , also added more than two million people since 1980 - due to an influx of Asians and growth in the military industry - for a total population of almost 26 million . Because of the millions already there , its growth rate was less than 10 percent , meaning that it is continuing to grow at about the same rate it did in the 1970 ' s . The state has grown so rapidly - in 1950 it had only 10. 5 million people - that one of every nine Americans is now a Californian. // As in Florida and Texas , the growth was pervasive , with 33 of its 58 counties registering increases above 10 percent and none losing population . <> <> Exurban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreading out in every region into new areas of low density . This can be seen in the development that is taking place around large metropolitan areas - 60 miles in all directions from New York , for example - and in small metropolitan areas that do not have large cities . It is confirmed by the census estimates. // The fastest growing counties of 100 , 000 or more people include the follwing peripheral counties : Big Bend and Montgomery around Houston ; Denton and Collin around Dallas ; Gwinett and Cobb around Atlanta ; Arapohoe and Boulder around Denver ; St. Tammany east of New Orleans ; Pascos north of Tampa and St. Petersburg , Fla . ; Lake east of Orlando , Fla . ; Prince William , Va. , and Howard , Md. , around Washington ; Kitsap near Seattle ; San Joaquin east of San Francisco ; Cleveland near Oklahoma City ; Davis north of Salt Lake City , and Dakota south of Minneapolis-St . Paul . All these counties had growth rates above 13 percent in the five-year period. // Most of these counties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are providing new jobs as well as places to live . Their expressways in the areas of new growth are so crowded that they are pressing Washington and their state capitals for new construction money. // St. Charles County , Mo. , on the outer ring of the St. Louis metropolitan area , provides an example of the latest surge of development around the larger population centers . <> <> Psychological Barrier Falls // St. Charles County is beyond the heavy layers of suburbs that surround the old city , beyond the airport , beyond the Interstate 270 beltway and beyond the Missouri River , which in the past had served as a practical and psychological barrier between the St. Louis area and the farmland beyond. // Since 1980 , the city of St. Louis lost another 6 percent of its population , leaving it with about 426 , 000 , half of what it was in 1950 . St. Louis County , which contains most of the suburbs , but not the city of St. Louis , grew less than 1 percent in the past five years , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly to St. Charles , which gained almost 14 percent , to 164 , 000 people , and to other peripheral counties. // St. Charles County is becoming increasingly independent . General Motors has a new plant in the town of Wentzville , 40 miles from St. Louis , and industrial parks are springing up throughout the county . It has become so independent that its city of 40 , 000 , also named St. Charles , was recently defined by the Federal Government as a central city along with St. Louis , a classification that entitles it to more Federal aid and confirms the growing independence of a piece of the over a broad matrix of exclusive housing developments , old towns and villages and new subdivisions of all sizes , interspersed with shopping malls , forests and farms . Many residents say they like it that way . <> <> ' We Like It Here ' // Anthony Martin , a young machinist laid off because of plant reductions in Peoria , was on his way to Texas to look for work when he stopped in St. Louis to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the aircraft contractor . He now lives with his wife and son in an old subdivision that reminds him of the small town in Illinois in which he grew up. // Mr. Martin drives to one of a number of satellite parking lots in the county and boards a McDonnell van that takes him to the plant in another suburb within 30 minutes. // The Martins told of how they like the area as they offered a visitor coffee in their home , which looks out over wooded hills beyond the houses . " It is really a family place , " said Mrs. Martin , noting the emphasis on organized sports for those of all ages and outdoor recreation in a riverside wildlife preserve. // They go to St. Louis or its big suburbs occasionally for sporting and cultural events and to visit the zoo , " but never to shop , " Mrs. Martin said. // The small metropolitan areas removed from large cities are much the same . Those that are growing the fastest , according to the estimates of the counties in which they are located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fla . ; Midland and Tyler , Tex . ; Lafayette , La . ; Bakersfield , Calif . ; Fort Collins , Colo . ; Lawton , Okla . ; Billings , Mont. , and Portsmouth , N.H. , among many others . <> <> The Regions // Only one state , Michigan , was reported to have undergone a substantial loss in population since 1980 . It showed a decline of almost 3 percent , or 250 , 000 people , with the industrial counties in the Detroit area suffering the heaviest losses . Wayne County alone dropped by more than 7 percent , to 2. 3 million , as the area failed to make a complete recovery from decline of the automobile industry and closure of other industrial plants early in the decade. // The picture was equally bleak , however , in parts of the Farm Belt . In Iowa , for example , 77 of the state ' s 99 counties lost population . Similar losses were experienced in the farming areas of Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , Missouri , Minnesota , South Dakota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decline of old industries , left the Middle West , except for Minnesota and North Dakota , with only marginal overall growth. // Elsewhere in the North , New England grew at a slightly slower rate than it had in the 1970 ' s , a growth of 1. 6 percent for the five-year period , compared with 4. 2 percent for the previous decade . <> <> South Atlantic Increases // None of the South Atlantic states were growing at the rapid rate they did in the 1970 ' s but Georgia , South Carolina , North Carolina and Virginia , in addition to Florida , were all growing at rates considerbly above the national average . To the East , the states of Kentucky , Tennessee , Alabama and Mississippi all showed a sharp drop from their growth rates of the 1970 ' s , due in part to the depressed farm economy and their failure to attract as many industrial plants as in the past. // Across the Mississippi River , however , the picture changed markedly , with the exception of Arkansas . From Louisiana across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates averaged above 12 percent . Only in the Northwest , which was hurt by a depressed lumber industry in the early part of the decade , was there a slowdown . Oregon , Washington and Idaho were growing at only a fraction of the rate they did in the 1970 ' s. //
