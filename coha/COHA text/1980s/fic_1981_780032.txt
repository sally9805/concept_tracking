 | THE thin Frenchman , whose name was LaPlante , in the next two days explained certain things that Mary had already partially deduced . LaPlante was the one who had been throttled by the big British soldier . His windpipe was bruised and he was low in vigor and spirits , and so he stayed in the vicinity of the prisoners , talking with them as much as his tender voicebox and limited mastery of their language would allow . He was a trader , he said , not a military man , and one who is a trader values information as much as he values goods . Thus he explained his penchant for talking and listening . As he understood it , Mary Ingles had been spared the gauntlet for one or both of two reasons : the death of the girl had satisfied the chief ; and Mary was highly esteemed by the warrior chieftain who had brought her here . His name , LaPlante told her , was Captain Wildcat . He was a very much favored chieftain of the Shawnee warrior sept , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and children had been moved temporarily into a roomy open-sided hut near the center of the village . The men had been taken somewhere else . By pointing at the torn rags of clothing and making sewing motions , Mary had suggested to Captain Wildcat that her sewing basket should be returned to her , and she had assumed the duty of repairing the women 's clothes while their wounds were being nursed . While she sewed , LaPlante came by frequently to linger and attempt conversation . He watched her sew when he was not ogling Bettie 's nudity.  | The gauntlet , he told her , was a manner of trial , an initiation , for the prisoners , preliminary to their adoption by families of the tribe . " You , Madame , " he said , " you are , ah , you are deja preuve . . . how does one say . . . worth-ee . M'sieu Wildcat say thees . " Mary glanced into the hut . Bettie sat there , in profile . She had slept on her stomach or remained sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bear to rest on her back , even though the squaw came in and refreshed the ointment on her back several times a day . The squaw had also taken over the care of Bettie 's arm , which was healing very slowly . Bettie had not met Mary 's eyes since the day of the gauntlet , and had said nothing to her . " I sh'ld rather been whipped by these people , than accused by my own , " Mary murmured , talking more to herself than to the Frenchman . " Eh bien , " LaPlante said , then leaned close with an earnest look on his face . He was watching as she put the finishing touches on Bettie 's dress . " Madame , I will say now , I propose to do commerce with you . " She looked at him suspiciously . " I do n't get your drift a-tall , sir . " " We will do , how you say , partners . Ecoutez , Madame : Goulart and I , we ' ave , ah , ah . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . of good cloth , with a . . . a . . . " He squinted with his effort to find the word . " Un moment , " he said , raising a forefinger and getting to his feet . He disappeared . Mary shook her head and continued sewing . She stole a glance at Bettie , catching her glowering in her direction . What the devil d'ye suppose is in her mind now ? she thought . Likely condemning me now for trafficking with enemies . . . Far up the street , she heard Tommy yelp in delight . He and Georgie had been taken into the company of a group of little Indian boys of the village , six of them about their own age who belonged to three tribal families , and had been playing for hours with them . To the delight of the village bucks , Tommy and Georgie were holding their own in the running and throwing games they had learned on the trail . They could be distinguished at a distance by their whiteness . Like the Indian boys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary , along with the dress of old Ghetel , waiting to be repaired .  | Mary was not sure now that the old woman 's name was Ghetel . Each time she would address her as Ghetel , the old woman would raise her hand and say , " Nah , nab ! Not Ghetel , Ghetel ! " She would display her front teeth and press her tongue tip against her palate as she said it , and would point at her mouth with a gnarled forefinger . " Ghetel , " Mary would say . " Ghetel ! " " Ghetel . " " Ach . Ghetel , " the old woman would shrug , and then Mary would shrug and return to her sewing . Now a shadow fell over Mary and when she looked up LaPlante and the other Frenchman , Goulart , stood before her . They each held one end of a bolt of checked cloth . " Thees , " said LaPlante . Behind the two traders stood a dozen or more Indians , men and women and girls who were admiring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LaPlante turned down a corner of the fabric for Mary to rub between her fingers . It was a soft and strong flannel , very luxurious to the touch . The checks were bright blue and a clean , clear white . " But what 's this t'do with me ? " Mary asked . " Would sew shirt , eh ? Make shirt . We would sell shirt to them . " He inclined his head toward the gathering Indians , whose desire for the bright cloth was evident . " Very good , ah , price . For you , for us . " Mary continued to look from LaPlante to Goulart and back , saying nothing . She had been too long and too recently involved in the survival of herself and her family to think yet about business . " They say you are fine squaw , " said Goulart , who was easier to understand than LaPlante . " A squaw is very useful . If useful , she is important . Alors , to have importance is to be treated well . It can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had read her mind about the matter of surviving and had connected it for her to the matter of business . The future of the captives was still an unknown . " Very well , then , " she said in a low voice , that Bettie might not hear . " We are in business . " When Mary worked with needle and thread and shears , her thoughts would flow through her like a song that changed but never ended . She thought much about Draper 's Meadows , because most of  | the sewing she had ever done she had done there . And she thought much about Will , because most of her sewing had been for Will . She wondered often what William would say about this business she was in , and what he would say about her partnership with the Frenchmen . They are only traders , she thought . They 're not the kind of Frenchmen who bring Indians to kill us . Will 's a most practical man , she thought . He does what 's best for everybody and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not ever made an enemy as I know of . Even when he was constable at Roanoke . Now Johnny , he 's a different sort . A hotspur , and will let a grudge color his judgment . I 'm more like Will , she thought . That 's a reason we 're married good . Married , she thought . The sun-flecked white and blue of the flannel she was working on filled her vision . I wonder how Will Ingles would look in a blue and white checked shirt , she thought . Pretty fancy ! She smiled down at the cloth . She remembered him as he looked when he would raise his arms to pull on a gray homespun shirt . She remembered his powerful thick trunk , thin white skin over hard muscle , and the reddishbrown hair all down the front of him . She remembered how his belly button would look , winking out through that belly-hair for a moment before the shirt would come down and hide it . She remembered how his hairy belly felt against the skin of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole weight would settle on her and the bigger caress would start inside her . Her loins remembered William and suddenly she was desolate and empty and bittersweet inside , and the blue and white pattern of the cloth shimmered and blurred . She had to stop sewing for a minute . After a few days the Frenchmen began taking Mary each morning to their trading post , near the center of the village . The post was another open-sided shelter , facing the street . In corners of the building there were several barrels and kegs , some metal cooking pots and kettles , boxes of knives and steel tomahawks and axes , a few mus-  | kets , a stack of gray woolen blankets and assortments of buttons , colorful glass beads and mirrors . There was also a great musky pile of pliant , well-cured deerskins and buffalo hides . The Frenchmen had built a long puncheon table and placed it across the open front of the hut , to conduct their trade over , and Mary could lay the cloth down on this table to cut it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun bringing her to the trading post . She would come over with the baby on her back , and while she was not sewing shirts she would nurse the baby . LaPlante had an Indian squaw , a girl of perhaps eighteen years , plump and pretty and easily incited to fits of strange , tearful giggling . Her name was **29;1092;TOOLONG , but she was called simply the Otter Girl . She had had LaPlante 's baby a few weeks ago but the little half-breed had been feeble and had died . She was morose . She was a Chahlagawtha Shawnee whom LaPlante had married in a bigger Shawnee town many miles north where the Chahlagawtha sept lived . The Otter Girl at once fell in love with the baby white girl and wanted to know her name . Soon she was taking care of the little girl , fulfilling her own frustrated motherly instincts , cooing to her and fondling her while Mary worked , and calling her Bay-tee Ali-no . Mary listened while she worked , and learned everything she could learn about where she was and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Wildcat , she learned , was from the Kispokothas , who were in charge of things pertaining to war in the Shawnee nation . This village in which they were now sojourning was called Lower Shawnee Town , and the river on whose bank it stood was called Scioto-cepe , the Scioto River . Because of its location near the O-y-o River and its importance as a trading center , Lower Shawnee Town was inhabited by Shawnees of all the five septs , but it was predominantly a Maykujay Shawnee town ; the old white-haired chief was a Maykujay . The Maykujays , Mary learned , were healers and seers and makers of magic . Mary learned that the Shawnees as a nation were newcomers to the valley of the O-y o . Years before , she learned , they had been driven from their ancestral lands in Virginia and Carolina by the Cherokee and Choctaw nations . They had gone northward then into lands on the upper O-y-o . They had lived there a few years until Englishmen  | came in and settled and drove out the game and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . They had become allied with the Frenchmen against the Englishmen , they said , because they were tired of being pushed back from one place to another and did not intend to give up these lands of the O-y-o valley . Mary did her best to learn these strange names and facts , because she sensed that she and her family were not through being moved around and imperiled , and that anything she might learn about places and about the feelings of the Indians might be useful in keeping them alive . She sewed and listened to the Otter Girl chortling to the baby and repeated the names over and over in her mind . She was surprised at the variety and complexity of the Indians ' civilization . The people seemed generally happy , always busy . In reality , Mary had to admit , their life seemed easier and more diverse than the hard , spare life in the white settlements . Otter Girl was beginning to absorb little Bettie Elenor into her own existence the same way the bucks had absorbed Tommy and Georgie into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river of her dreams and fears , she would become aware now and then of Otter Girl 's melodious voice softly murmuring endearments and lullabys to the baby , and she would look up from her needlework and see the baby 's ivory-white skin against the flushed-umber skin of Otter Girl 's torso , held close and lovingly against the squaw 's swollen , dark-nippled breasts . Mary was both comforted and disturbed by this bond she saw developing before her own eyes . That the infant was being showered with caresses and gentle voice-music that she herself could not give it during the work hours was a very good thing ; she could tell that the baby would grow secure and quiet under such care . It was a far cry from the harsh and miserable circumstance of its birth in the woods . But sometimes Mary 's own breast would ache for the baby Otter Girl was holding . And then late one somnolent afternoon , when sunlight through the trees was dappling that tender scene , making trembling blue shadows on their velvet skin , Mary looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart plummet to the pit of her stomach : Little Bettie Elenor was puckering and rounding her miniature  | red mouth ; Otter Girl shifted the infant slightly on her arm and with her other hand cupped her breast and pressed its turgid nipple against the seeking mouth . The baby attached itself instantly to this offering , drawing and smacking with relish , and Otter Girl 's eyes glittered and her face melted into blissful repose . The white face and the brown breast . And yet , Mary knew , they were now one . The Shawnee milk nourishing the English child . Something between sadness and outrage told her to jump up and seize the baby from the squaw 's embrace . But stronger than that was the realization that she could not bear to separate them at such a moment . For a while she tried to sew through a blue and white shimmer of tears . But gradually it became easier to bear . Y 've known this would come to happen , she told herself . It 'll be best f'r us all , finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Bet ever saw it . The first shirt Mary finished was for a buck who was the son of the village chief . He bartered for it with narrow bracelets that looked like pewter . Mary watched the transaction . The Indian wanted to give the Frenchmen one bracelet for the shirt . Goulart insisted on three bracelets . After a great deal of arm-waving by Goulart and solemn head-shaking by the Indian , Goulart took two bracelets and gave the Indian his shirt . The Indian broke into a broad smile then , slipped a long , slim pole in one sleeve of the shirt and out the other and then , yipping with delight , trotted down the street waving the shirt like a banner , showing off his rare new possession . " Tres bien , " Goulart said , grinning to LaPlante . He bent to show the bracelets to Mary , then gave one of them to LaPlante . " Argent , " he said . " What ? " Mary asked . " Argent , " said LaPlante . " Ah , silvair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shawnee find silvair in the earth , " Goulart said . " Only their chiefs know the place . " Mary thought about that . " Then you trade for silver , do ye ? "  | " Pas beaucoup . A little . Most they pay in furs . But not thees , ahm , season . " Mary thought some more . " Is a checked shirt really worth two silver bracelets ? " she said . The Frenchmen looked at each other and grinned . They began chuckling , low in their throats . " A shirt , " said Goulart then , " is worth what one will pay for a shirt . That , Madame , ees commerce . " She thought some more . " Would the Shawnee pay two bracelets for just the cloth ? " Goulart shrugged . " Peut-etre . . . Non . No . Maybe one . " " Then , " she said , " I reckon y 'll be a-payin ' me one of those bracelets for making the shirt ? " " Heu ! " LaPlante exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' commerce ! " Mary looked at them through hard-edged eyelids . " And why 's it not , pray ? " Goulart thought awhile . " Because , Madame , because you have no use for silvair here . And you will be here . Toujours . " " What is that , ' too-zhoo ? ' " " That , Madame , is always . ' " Dogs barked somewhere . A whiff of roasting meat drifted in . A fly came and walked on Mary 's arm . She could hear the voices of Indian children at play . For a few moments she had been wondering if she might make enough as a shirtmaker to buy freedom for herself and her family . The possibility had gleamed like a thin beam of sunlight through a chink in a wall . " Then tell me this , " she said after a while . " What am I to be paid for the shirts I make ? " LaPlante and Goulart glanced at each other . Though they did not look alike  --  Goulart being stocky with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary thought they seemed to be twins in their avaricious souls . " We have talk on thees , " said Goulart . " We assure you , you will be pay well . " " But yes , " exclaimed LaPlante . " I sh'ld think so , " said Mary . " Otherwise , I sh'ld have no reason  | to sew shirts , should I ? " They nodded , a little abashed . " Then what , " she said , " is my wage ? " " With each ten shirts you do , " said Goulart , " we pay you one fine wool blanket . " Mary 's mouth dropped open , then she set her jaw . " Nay , " she said . " I 'll not sew for that ! " " It is late in summer , " Goulart said in a tone less friendly . " When the cold wind comes and the trees are naked , you and your children will count a blanket good pay . " " Silvair not keeps one warm , " LaPlante said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ten shirts , " she said . " Four . " " Four ! Sacre ! Non ! Eight , then . " " Six . " They looked at each other . They looked at the Indians who were gathering outside the hut to gaze at the cloth . Just then the chiefs i son trotted by with a big smile on his face , his new shirt fluttering like a flag from the pole over his shoulder . They shrugged . " Eh bien . Six . " Goulart wanted to see the gold wedding band on Mary 's finger . It was only a narrow little band . " I am remarkable that the Indians did not take this from you , " Goulart said . " I 'm glad they did n't try , " she said . " It wo n't come over the knuckle any more . " " Sometime if that ees so , they will cut off the finger . " She shivered . " Well , then I 'm glad Cap'n Wildcat got no such an idee . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Nay . ' Two n't come off . " " We could get it off with bear fat . " " Nay , " she said , more stern-voiced now . " I mean ' two n't come off because I wo n't let it come off . " Goulart drew the corner of his mouth back and glanced at the ground . " Eh bien , " he said . She began to wonder then whether Goulart was a man who might cut off a woman 's ring finger . She decided he could bear watching .  | He was a merchant , and therefore gold would mean more to him , she decided , than to an Indian . Each new purchaser of a Mary Ingles checked shirt would parade proudly through the village exhibiting it . Mary became very industrious in the shirt-making business , working usually from dawn to dusk through the long August days , stopping only to commune several times a day with her children , talking to them about their father to keep them thinking of him . By the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for herself and Bettie Elenor , and one to be shared by Tommy and Georgie . Then she started on a third halfdozen of the garments , with which she would secure a blanket for Bettie Draper . The Frenchmen were delighted with the arrangement . They were disposing of their cloth at a wonderful profit in silver and hides and war booty . Bettie became less sullen when she saw the practical yield of Mary 's activity . Already there had been two unseasonably cool nights , one of them dank and rainy , to impress on her the providence of Mary 's business . One afternoon when she was sewing in the shade , Captain Wildcat 's voice came through the murmur of town sounds . He was nearby , and she looked up quickly for him . He was standing in the street outside the trading post , talking to Goulart . He had come to buy a shirt , and with him was one of his warriors who also wanted one of the prestigious garments . While Wildcat talked with Goulart about the price of shirts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was strange how he looked at her now . She had never seen fear in his face and never had expected to , but now what was in his face looked a little like fear , or timidity at least . No one else had ever looked at her quite that way  --  except Will . She had gone to the mountains very young , and she had never been courted by anyone but Will because there had been no-one else at Draper 's Meadows to court her. - Will had looked at her with just such timidity during the days when he was getting ready to ask for her hand . She had realized then that he had looked fearful because he had been afraid she might refuse him . It had been the only time she  | had ever realized that a woman could have any kind of power over a man . Timidity , she remembered , had looked odd on Will Ingles because he was a fearless man . Timidity now looked odd on Captain Wildcat , and for the same reason . He looked like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage who dealt in lives and deaths and would be chief . Mary almost smiled at this , but it was too serious in its consequences . She was in no position to make light of his yearnings . Wildcat was naked except for his breechclout and moccasins and jewelry . Even his sinewy , shapely muscled legs were hairless . They were oiled against insects and they gleamed with reflected sunlight , as hard and smooth as cast iron . Even I got hairier legs than that man , she thought . Wildcat and his warrior had brought familiar things to barter for the shirts , and the sight of these made her jaw clench . The warrior had brought her own pewter tea kettle , one of her wedding gifts from her mother . A tea kettle was not enough for a fine and prestigious shirt , in Goulart 's estimation , and so the Indian also produced a bullet-mold , which she recognized as Will 's . Damn you , she thought , looking at the warrior 's face . This was the Indian who had held the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the massacre . Mary had a notion that she might barter separately and directly with the Frenchman to get the tea kettle back in her own possession but decided she would not , because the need for blankets was more urgent . Wildcat had brought Colonel Patton 's huge broadsword to exchange for a blue and white shirt . Its blade was brown with rust now and tarnished with the blood it had spilled on that day . The beheading of Phil Barger flashed in Mary 's mind , and she turned away and would not look at the weapon again . A shadow came across her sewing . " Coat must . . . hold Wildcat good , " she heard the chieftain say . He had completed the purchase arrangements and now stood inside the hut , towering over her , feet wide apart in that stance men take to make themselves look brave , looking down at her , expressionless . He was standing under the highest part of the roof , at its front edge , but his head was almost touching it .  | " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand this . " What you do ? " he responded . Neither was understanding the other 's words , and the resolution in Wildcat 's face was beginning to crumble into confusion . " What did you say about a coat ? " she asked him . " This , " he said , pointing to the flannel , " you make . . . " He then drew the fingertips of both his hands from his shoulders down to his hips . " . . . be like Wildcat . " " Fit , " interjected Goulart from one side . " He mean it have to fit him trey bien . " " Oh , he 's a dandy , is ' e now ? Eh , well . " She put off her lap the garment she had been sewing , gathered her legs under her and stood up . Under the low , slanting roof she had to stand very close to him , and , as if afraid of her nearness , he stepped backward , bumping the table . It was an unusually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his embarrassment . She picked up a piece of ribbon she had been using as a measuring tape . She advanced on him and he leaned backward against the table . Goulart had gone out into the street and was showing the long sword to bystanders . Otter Girl sat back in the shadows , nursing the white baby and covertly admiring Wildcat . " Hold y'rself still , " Mary told him , and raised the ribbon to his left shoulder with one hand . He shied from it . " Be still , " she said . She knew he understood that ; he had said it to her so often . Then she stretched the ribbon down along his arm to his wrist , and at that point pinched the ribbon and then marked it with a bit of chalk from her sewing basket . She saw that gooseflesh had risen on his brawny brown arm where she had touched him . He had a good , clean , musky smell . " Now be still again , " she said . She stretched the tape across his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and his little dark brown nipples stood hard as if he were cold . " Gettin ' stirred , are ye , chief ? " she muttered with a nasty little half-smile , and he responded : " What you said ? " " Never mind , chief . " She wanted to laugh ; the urge was for a laughter of bitterness and mockery . He could see that she was about to laugh at him , and the look  | that flashed through his dark eyes at the moment she glanced up was a desperate , angry , insulted look . He was not a man to be mocked . She knew that , and she knew that she had fared so well in captivity because she had never annoyed him . The way he felt about her ? whatever strange way that might be  --  could still determine her fate ; she knew that quite well . And so , thankful that Bettie was not here to see this , she suddenly stared into Wildcat 's eyes with a serious intensity , which she meant only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It transformed him . The timidity , the hurt , vanished from his countenance and now his face was hawkishly earnest ; his irises suddenly went deep and limpid , as if a reptile had opened the protective veil over its eyes . " Hear , " he said in a voice low and intense . " White mo-ther is good blood . Children good blood . Come with Wildcat to Kispoko Town . " He pointed northward , up the river . To Mary , farther up the river meant farther from Draper 's Meadows . That alone was enough to make her shake her head . Wildcat 's eyelids hardened ; his nostrils flared . Then he softened his glare and grasped her upper right arm firmly . She looked down at his hand and kept looking at it . She did not like to be touched by this man . It unsettled her . " Wildcat will be , " he said , and then his next words shocked her like a blow : " . . . the father of your sons . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought after the flash of indignation had cooled down inside her , leaving her weary and almost ready to agree to anything that would mean security for her children and herself . Aye , one could go along with such an offer , I reckon , as there 's no other choice to speak of but slavery or maybe death . There 'd be no shame in it really , now would there ? Captives often became squaws ; she 'd heard of many . And this Captain Wildcat was no ordinary repulsive Indian to her ; he was noble enough , for what he was , and he would be important in his tribe , and she and her children , she felt confident , would be well honored and cared for if she agreed to his desires . Oh , not to worry about one 's fate day by day , she thought with a  | heavy longing . Just to give up . One could be comfortable . One could .. . He was still holding her upper arm , firmly but not hurtingly ; she was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensed Otter Girl 's attention behind her . But the girl could not understand their words . Mary brought her left hand up slowly across her bosom now , the ribbon still pinched between thumb and forefinger , to put her hand on the hard , hairless brown wrist of the hand that held her . And as she brought her hand up , the sunlight reflecting from the bright outdoors glinted on the little gold band on her finger . She took a deep breath . She put the heel of her hand on his wrist and shoved his hand away , still not looking at his face , just at her own hand now . Bright yellow light flooded her eyes . His dark silhouette had vanished from between her and the sunbeaten street . He was gone . She stood looking at the ribbon for minutes . The sounds of the town , the voices , the barking dogs , which she had not been hearing for all those minutes , began filling her ears gradually as if she were approaching the village from a silent place out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the ribbon with her other hand and held the ribbon horizontally in front of her . His shoulders are this wide , she thought . During that week several war parties came in with white prisoners . Mary saw the wretches from a distance as they were led to the stakes . And each following day she would find herself alone in the trading post when the town 's whole population would gather on the far side of the council lodge for the formation of the gauntlet . She would sew diligently , concentrating on her work , sometimes humming songs aloud to shut out the excited murmuring and wailing of the distant crowd and , especially , the chilling screams of its victims . The people of the Shawnee Town seemed never to tire of this cruel entertainment ; only the feeble and sick excused themselves from it . Captives who had come earlier and had already endured the gauntlet were kept away from it . The Shawnees were skillful , Mary noted , at keeping their white captives separated in small groups . Even though  | she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the town , she never came within speaking distance of any whites other than Bettie and the old widow and the children . On two separate days she saw Henry Lenard at the far end of the street with the other white men who had been in the same circle of captives a week before . They were carrying rails , burdened as heavily as slaves . As the village population swelled with the influx of war parties and prisoners , there was a detectable stir of anticipation . Long councils were held almost every day in the central lodge . LaPlante and Goulart would come from those councils full of vivid war stories they had heard . Men , some red , a few white , and some who could have been either , rode into the town on lathered horses and went directly to the lodge . Mary guessed they were couriers bringing war news . Parties of warriors would ride or strut up the streets , some of them with bound wounds , bringing no prisoners but displaying grisly scalps at the top of long poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the town bucks exhibiting her checked shirts . " Bettie , " she exclaimed one evening . " That Otter Girl today went to stand in the line to whip prisoners .

How can . . . how can the same person . . . " Bettie 's eyes grew dark , veiled . " You saw ' em slaughter my baby , " she said . " Likewise I wonder how can you traffic with ' em . An ' let y'r newborn suckle at a heathen 's teat . " It was as hurtful as a slap , coming just now . Mary lifted her chin and hardened her heart . " Bet , I advise ye , but f'r my prudent conduct , y 'd likely be dead now . " " Would I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a snot-sniveler ! " When she was making Captain Wildcat 's shirt , she was full of curious , shape-shifting daydreams . Plying her needle in tight stitches along a shoulder seam , she had a sense of the hard , manly shoulder that would eventually be clothed by this work . But the shoulder in the daydreams was not always brown and hairless ; some-  | times it would be fair and freckled and hairy : Will 's shoulder , somewhere at the end of a long river journey . She would try to remember landmarks along the rivers . She would try to make a map in her head , a map of a river twisting and rushing down through the dark mountains ; and at the far end of that river map , she would see the inside log walls of her cabin , with the coats and pans and gun hanging from pegs where they had always been , and the old clock ticking ; she could remember all the marks of the broad-ax upon those hewn walls , and the marks of the toothchisel on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would remind herself sometimes ; it 's not there anymore . I looked back and saw it burning down . But she could not remember that burning very well ; she would see vaguely , for an instant , the shake roof falling in with a roar of colorless flame in the sunlight , but that vision would go away and she would see , as she ' had seen so often from underneath , the pole rafters above the bed , the shingles becoming distinct in the morning light , or flickering with hearthglow at night , and the house existed complete and intact in her mind , every log and beam and peg and stone of it , more real and more significant now even than when she had lived in it and touched it with her hands and swept it with a rush-broom . It was as if she had brought the real house with her in her head , and if she could go there she could set it right back down where the charred chimney must now be standing , and it would be instantly complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door with his tools on his shoulder , his big frame for a moment a silhouette in the sunny rectangle of doorway . . . And then the silhouette in her mind 's eye would become Captain Wildcat standing before her under the low roof of the trading post a few days ago with his hand on her upper arm , making his proposal to her . She would look up from the blue and white cloth then , thinking that he would be standing there , but he would not be . It would instead be Goulart standing there in her light , scratching his armpit or groin , watching his partner sew the wonderful shirts , his eyes agleam with profits . Wildcat had not come back since she had pushed his hand away , and she felt vulnerable , as if a protective wall had been torn down between her and the mass of nameless , ruddy , cruel Shawnee faces .  | Sometimes her daydreams would go up a river in the opposite direction : up this Scioto-cepe to Kispoko Town , and there she would imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boughs and hides and blankets under one sloping wall , a fire-ring of blackened stones in the center of the dirt floor , herself and Tommy and Georgie and Bettie Elenor all living under his roof . His squaw , she would think , putting it in words . My children his children . Ingles blood Indian blood . Nay ! she would think , her heart thumping and her face flushed with anger and embarrassment : Nay . I 'm Will 's , that 's whose I am , and that 's whose I 'll ever be ! But even at that , when she would feel the first hint of autumnal coolness in the dawns of late summer , and think how far north they had been brought from Draper 's Meadows , she might envision again that warm pallet , those fur robes , that fire-ring ; unlike Draper 's Meadows , it was a place possible to get to , and , despite herself , she would watch the street for Captain Wildcat and listen for his voice . He 's offered me protection and I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of herself for that . But she knew that it was still in his power to take her without her consent . Sometimes it seemed that she was counting on him to do that . " Tell Wildcat I 've done his shirt , " she said to Goulart one afternoon , folding up the biggest and best one she 'd yet made . " Tell him he can come and get it now . " Goulart went away , and she sat waiting , her heartbeat racing . Goulart came back alone and took the shirt from her . " He tell me to bring it to heem . " She felt so alone and vulnerable now she could hardly bear it . She took Bettie Elenor abruptly from Otter Girl 's breast and put her to her own . Otter Girl 's eyes glittered with tears of hurt , but Mary ignored them . Squaw , she thought contemptuously at her . Then she sat the rest of the afternoon , not sewing , the baby at her breast as a soft armor against loneliness , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye . Her body could remember the tickle of his hair and his weight upon her and the sour smell of his work-sweat and the breath-taking entry of his rigid flesh into her moist , wanting flesh ; her body could  | still remember all this . But every day it was harder to see his face in her daydreams . Then there was a long day of councils and drums . The Frenchmen came back from the council lodge late that day glowing with excitement and talking sonorously to each other with much waving of arms and gesturing of hands . They drank from cups of rum and discoursed for a long time while Mary sewed . After a while , she began to think she was hearing a familiar name , and she interrupted : " Are you saying Washington ' ? " They turned and looked at her curiously , then LaPlante replied : " Yes . That was the name . " " What of Washington ? " " Eh , " Goulart said . " A chief of this town named Red Hawk . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he aimed onzeah , eleven  --  times at the Virginia colonel , Washington , most clearly , but his bullets do not kill him . Red Hawk says then he does not shoot at him again as the Great Spirit must protect thees Washington . Red Hawk says he believes this because his gun never misses its mark before . " The story made Mary shiver with awe . She envisioned the battle in her mind , and it was very clear , because she could remember the face of the young colonel . " Eh , bien , " Goulart was saying . " Few of your Anglais were so protected . For every Indian or French soldier who fell , twenty of your Anglais . A thousand of your officers and soldiers were shot , madame . Sucre ! Quelle victoire ! " Mary felt a cold sweat . Surely , she thought , these are only Indian boasts and can not be true . Surely . The next day began with drums . Mary was lying on her blanket in the open hut with the baby at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something unexpected was happening , and her heart sped up as if to match the drumbeat . There had been some security in the routine pattern of the days at the trading post , and any disruption , like this drumming , could suddenly throw her fully back into the anxiety of peril .  | The drums stopped within five minutes , but by then the whole population of the town was moving up the streets toward the center of the town . " What d'ye suppose ? " Bettie asked , up on one elbow nearby . Tommy and Georgie were sitting up , too ; Tommy was yawning and Georgie was rubbing his fists in his eyes . " Nothing to do with us , pray , " said Mary . But the public gatherings in the Shawnee Town always seemed to have something to do with the prisoners , and she had little hope that they would be ignored today . Then , when Captain Wildcat and another warrior chieftain  --  both in their new checked shirts  --  arrived at the lean-to , she was sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , drawing his palm toward his chest . " All come , " he said . " All . " Blinking and rumpled , they emerged from the hut , their hearts racing at that pace which an early-morning fright can induce . Mary looked for a hint of something personal in Wildcat 's eye , but his eye was now again like the veiled eye of a reptile . " Blankets , " Wildcat said , again with that summoning motion . Mary stooped into the hut to gather and fold the two blankets she and the two boys had been sleeping on . Her sense of dread was heightened somehow by this . The blankets were their only possessions and they were being told to bring them . " This too ? " Mary said , holding up her sewing basket . Wildcat nodded . Mary slipped the little basket between the folds of her blanket and put the baby girl in her carrier . She slipped her arms through the straps and picked up the blankets and came out into the open with the others . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky . Ghetel squinted up malevolently . The chieftains led them toward the council lodge . Mary held Georgie 's hand and Bettie led Tommy . They moved along with the crowd of townspeople . They are n't carrying clubs and switches , Mary thought . Thank the Lord for that . But notions of other tortures she had heard about through the years  --  rape , burning at the stake , death by slicing , dismemberment , disembowelment  --  kept crowding her mind and she had to fight them down with a wordless , constant prayer of faith . They were taken into the council lodge . It was the most spacious  | room Mary had ever been in , even bigger than the livery barn in Philadelphia where her parents had taken her once . It was at least ninety feet long and fifty feet wide . Its roof was held up by an ingenious framework of upright tree trunks overlaid with horizontal poles . Pale skylight filtered down into the smoky gloom through a series of smokeholes in the roof . The floor was smooth-packed , swept earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Indian flesh was dense . They were herded into the center of the floor , where some two dozen white people , men and women and children , stood . The skylight made their faces whiter , their eye sockets and cheeks more hollow . The men 's hands were tied behind their backs . Henry Lenard raised his head in greeting when he saw Mary and her party . The captives were surrounded by a circle of sitting chiefs and chieftains , behind whom a large part of the town 's population stood . Smoking pipes lay on blankets before the sitting chiefs , and a thin wraith of smoke curled up from a single clay bowl of embers toward the hole in the ceiling . Mary felt as if some ceremony had been going on before they were brought in . They stood amid the hum of voices for a few minutes , until another group of prisoners  --  three men , one of them with a head wound bound in a bloody rag  --  was brought in . Then the whitehaired chief rose in an easy motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and raised his right hand . The room grew still , and he began speaking . His voice was deep and loud , very resonant in the cavernous lodge . Then he stopped talking and stretched his hand toward one of the young warrior chieftains , and sat down . As the chieftain rose and stepped forward , Mary saw LaPlante and Goulart standing near one of the upright columns , looking on . The chieftain walked among the prisoners . He stopped first behind the sturdy man who had tried to strangle LaPlante at the gauntlet . He grabbed the prisoner by his bound wrists and the hair on the crown of his head , and forced him to walk to one of the columns . Warriors turned the man 's back to the column , kicked his feet out from under him , and then quickly wrapped a leather thong around his neck and around the post , so that he now sat unable to move , unable even to slump forward . He grimaced against the  | tightness of his bonds , and Mary saw that his front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen him . The chieftain talked briefly over him , turning to look down and spit on him twice . Then all the chiefs and chieftains grunted something in response . The chief snapped out a brief statement and some warriors came forth with a bowl and swabs . They cut the big white man 's clothing off and quickly painted his chest and face black with a fluid from the bowl . Then the chieftain selected from among the prisoners the foreign man who had curled up whimpering at the head of the gauntlet , and tied him to another of the uprights . After a few more minutes of discussion among the chiefs , he too was painted black . He sat looking skyward and sobbing , and it was that sight that made Mary suspect that the black paint signified death . It seemed that they were going to kill one because he was too brave , and the other because he was not brave enough . Mary tousled the hair of Georgie , who was beginning to quake leaning against her leg . She stole a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had probably not yet guessed the meaning of the black paint . Then she glanced at Captain Wildcat , but he was not looking in her direction . Finally she took a sidelong look in the direction of the Frenchmen . LaPlante was looking elsewhere , but Goulart caught her glance , and one of his eyes began twitching as if with a tic . It might have been a tic , from stress . Or it might have been a wink of reassurance . Mary could only pray that she had become too valuable a business asset to be painted black . But by that token , what 's to become o ' poor Bet , she thought . She 's o ' no earthly use to ' em . . . The chieftain then went to the third foreign man who had run the gauntlet that day , and pulled him out to stand before the chiefs . The chieftain talked briefly , got noises of assent from them and then had warriors take the man out of the council lodge . Next , the little foreign girl was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of a middle-aged Indian man who led her out of the lodge . Ghetel was the next one to be pointed out . As she stepped out before the chiefs a murmur of good humor went up in the big room .  | The chieftain spoke , then the chief spoke again , and then another of the elder chiefs stood up and talked , looking at the old woman from time to time . Then he sat down , and a buzz of cheerful voices followed . The old woman was led , looking bewildered , out of the lodge . Having thus disposed of all his captives , that chieftain resumed his seat in the square , and the chief turned to his left to address another of the warrior chieftains . This one rose and went among the captives , sorted out three , one at a time , and they too were taken out of the lodge . To Mary the process seemed like cutting horses out of a herd for sale . This business continued for more than an hour , and the dwindling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodge , awaiting fates they could not understand . No more were tied up and painted black , and the two who had been remained lashed to the posts . The soldier glared defiantly around , watching everything , his pale eyes stark and ferocious in contrast to the blackened face . The other kept his eyes closed and muttered constantly to himself . At last Wildcat got up , and by this time the only prisoners left standing in the arena were those from Draper 's Meadows : Mary , with her baby on her back , Bettie , Tommy and Georgie , and Henry Lenard . Mary looked down at Georgie . The boy was gazing at Wildcat with the kind of wide-eyed admiration and trust he had always beamed upon his own father . She glanced back and down at Tommy , who was gazing likewise . She heard Henry clear his throat nearby . Wildcat went to Henry first . He pointed at him and began to speak . Today Captain Wildcat was the finest sort of Indian . There was nothing human about him today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a war chief of tomorrow , standing straight as a plank , glowing in a beautiful new blue and white shirt , slicked raven hair gleaming in the skylight from the smokehole above , filling the air with thundering words , with well-timed pauses , with graceful sweeps and powerful thrusts of his hands . Mary wondered what there would be about the culling of a slaveherd that would require such epic eloquence . And the worst of it was that , for the first time , his oratory seemed  | never to refer to her . Not once had he glanced her way . Two warriors came to the center of the room and accompanied Henry away . He did not look back . Then Wildcat stood by Bettie . He talked for a minute about her , then pointed to a round-faced Indian man of about fifty . The chief nodded and said , " Oui-sah . " That , Mary remembered , meant " good . " It was the only word she had understood through this whole transaction . Wildcat grasped Bettie 's left arm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the round-faced man . " Go . Him . " Bettie 's eyes widened , faltered , searched Mary 's face . They glittered with sudden tears while her mouth seemed to try to form a question . Mary suddenly had the awful notion that she and Bettie would never see each other again . And Bettie 's stricken expression seemed to say that she understood that too . At once they lurched toward each other and embraced . Neither was able to get a word out past the little strangling noises in the top of her throat . Then Bettie was pulled away . She went away into the gloom , an indistinct shape veiled by a sudden flow of hot tears . Tommy and Georgie were both piping questions Mary was too stunned to hear . Mary raised her arm and put her face against the upper sleeve of her dress to dry the tears and mucus that had so suddenly poured from her eyes and nose . Above her own snuffling she could hear Wildcat talking . When she had gotten herself under control , LaPlante was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying . " Pas de rien , Madame . You will be , ah , with us . In the store . Our , ah , partner . We ' ave , arranged so . " Anger and disgust brought her voice back to her . " Bought me , " she snapped . " Ehhhh . . . " LaPlante shrugged . But his eyes fell . Then he looked at her again with a blazing smile . " So come , eh ? We make shirts , eh ? " He grasped her upper arm and , with a bow to Wildcat and the chiefs , started to lead her out of the square . She understood , rationally , that once again she had been exceedingly lucky , that she had survived this latest perilous reckoning probably better than anybody . She was not to be put to death ; she  | was not to be taken away to still another unknown place ; she had not been given in concubinage to some savage stranger . But even this kind of fortune was not enough to outweigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sold like a slave . And a part of the insult , it shocked her to realize  --  she rushed to put it out of her mind  --  was that it was Wildcat , her protector and advocate in this alien world , this man who had spared her the running of the gauntlet , this man who had looked at her one sungilded evening on the O-y-o River with some deep personal thoughtfulness , this man who once had looked at her with admiration , even tenderness , and had said she was oui-sah , good ; this man who once had held her arm and offered her a proposal ; it was this man who had now simply sold her off , as if she were of no importance to him . He did not want her if she did not want him . And she was immediately ashamed of herself for having felt hurt by it . She lifted her chin and looked coldly at Wildcat 's eyes . He stood between Tommy and Georgie . He held each by one hand . His chiseled face gleamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes was hidden in shadow . For just an instant they held each other 's gaze , hers indignant , his inscrutable , and she reached slowly toward her sons . " Come , " she said to them , still staring at Wildcat 's face . " No , " Wildcat said quietly . She squinted up at him . " What ? " " No , " he repeated . She looked down , confused , her hands still reaching for her sons ' . Wildcat turned his head and spoke three syllables over his shoulder . A brave appeared behind him and took the boys by their arms and hauled them back out of the circle . Mary 's eyes went rapidly from them to Wildcat 's impassive face , then back to them , then returned to his face , confused and beseeching . " Will be Kispokotha Shawnees , " Wildcat said . " I take . " LaPlante and Goulart were standing behind Mary . They saw her begin to shake and crouch . She was either going to scream or get sick or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for herself , or them , with an outburst in the great council lodge . So LaPlante nodded to Goulart , and Goulart nodded to LaPlante , and each grabbed her under an arm . LaPlante clapped his hand over her  | mouth . They carried her swiftly , her toes just brushing the dirt floor , out of the lodge and into the misty rain . They did not have to fight her . She had fainted . They rushed down the street toward their trading post with her limp body between them . From the rig on her back came the thin , purling wail of her baby , Bettie Elenor , whom Wildcat had not wanted . The baby had been jostled awake and was hungry . They gave her to Otter Girl when they got to the trading hut . Otter Girl stuck a ruddy nipple in her mouth and smiled down at her , and the two Frenchmen sat on the floor flanking their unconscious partner , the shirtmaker , ready to do whatever they might have to do to deal with her when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her vision . She saw everything in clear , hard outline now , no longer through a mist of hope , trust or sentiment . Her heart was as small and cold and heavy as a bullet . When Wildcat had taken her children away from her to Kispoko town , he at last had made her invulnerable . Two days after the council in the great lodge , the Indians took the two black-painted prisoners to a clearing north of the town and tied them standing to posts . The men were naked and had been scrubbed by squaws with sand and gravel in a creek until their hides were pink . They had been purified for the ritual of dying . Their wrists had been bound behind them , then attached by five-foot tethers which allowed them to walk around the posts . Around each post the town squaws had built perimeters of kindling wood , stacked waist high . They had also sharpened thirty or forty slender fifteen-foot poles , then laid them on the ground , radiating out like wheel spokes , their pointed ends in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the clearing , along with townspeople , to witness the executions . The sun had come out . It drew at the moisture left by two days of rain and the air was thick and humid . Mary 's dress was sweat-soaked and stuck to her skin . Sweat ran in tiny courses down the dark and gleaming back of a brave who stood in front of Mary . She was determined not to watch what was to happen at the stakes . Although they would not let her leave , she intended to look at the back of the Indian , not at the condemned prisoners . They could not  | make her look . She had seen enough , in the massacre , at the gauntlet and at the prisoner market , to convince her that she had descended into hell . Somehow , without dying , she had come to hell . These Shawnee Indians were demons , and she had been fooled several times by their few little gestures of patience and good humor . But she could not understand what sins she was suffering for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor broken a commandment . She had never been proud nor gluttonous nor envious beyond those little degrees an ordinary person falls to day by day . Squaws were carrying torches out to ignite the circles of firewood now . The crowd was silent , waiting . No . Those two are truly in hell , she thought . I must be instead in purgatory . She had heard purgatory mentioned in preachments and had never understood it , but now she seemed to understand it . And she had never thought hell and purgatory could be in the same place , but it seemed they were here . Watching the sweat stream down the Indian 's back , she heard the kindling begin to crackle . Here and there in the crowd , voices whooped , male and female . The big soldier 's voice burst forth with a powerful string of oaths , against bloody heathens , against greasy squaws ; then the oaths stopped and were followed by a quavering bellow of agony . Mary smelled woodsmoke and felt the heat from the flames even here . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a hot day for such a hot spectacle . The Indian 's back was not blocking Mary 's view now , and for an instant she saw the soldier writhing against the pole , trying to press back against it to get as far as possible away from the perimeter of fire . His eyes were squeezed tightly shut ; his teeth were bared in a grimace . The flames were scarcely visible in the bright sunlight ; the firewood was turning black , and the naked man 's figure was distorted by the updraft of heated air . Gray smoke piled into bright sky . Mary shut her eyes and shrank backward into the crowd . Then she had to open them again because of waves of vertigo that made her fear she would fall . The kindling had already fallen to gray and pink coals , still sending up a shimmering curtain of hot air . The soldier was on his hands and knees now , making a wet , grunting noise as he tried to cough out his scorched lungs . His hair was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . The Indians were all yelling now , and squaws were stooping to pick up the long poles . Holding them by the outer ends , they began jabbing at the man 's blisters with the smouldering points of the poles . Mary turned and wove among the spectators to get out of the circle , closing her throat to keep from gushing vomit . The Indians were now too absorbed to heed her . She found her way back to the trading post . There was no one in the town . Off in the distance the blended voices of the crowd made a low hum , and now and then a high shriek would come to her . Probably they were at work on the second man by now . Mary put Bettie Elenor to her breast now and sat rocking to and fro on her haunches , scarcely conscious of what she was doing . Flies buzzed . The baby sucked and swallowed , sucked and swallowed . Mary ran the thoughts of hell and purgatory through her mind again and again . Finally she decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust . The reality was that she was here on this earth and her husband was on this same earth , four or five hundred miles away across a mountain range , at the far end of a wilderness river , and that the only thing to be done if she were to continue het-life as a real human being was to go there , where her husband was , to get there somehow or perish in the attempt . Wildcat was gone out of her life now , and she did not have to worry any more about pleasing him or displeasing him . She did not have to worry any more about whether she was going to be his squaw . She did not have to bother her head any more with the delicate and unspeakable doubt about whether she would have liked being his squaw . He had given her but one chance to accept him and had been too proud to claim her after she had refused . He had simply taken her sons from her , getting in that way the precious Ingles blood he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a bean-pod . She had been such a fool to care what he wanted or did , she thought now , such a fool , and in a way it seemed to her that she had been unfaithful to Will by even considering Wildcat 's desires . She had really never needed Wildcat anyway ; she had only thought she had , she rationalized now . Through her own industry  | and her own character , she could have become important enough here in Shawnee Town to be her own protector . I could do that yet , she thought . But I 'm not going to . I 'm no Shawnee , nor ever will be . I 'm Mrs. William Ingles . I turned aside from ' ee in my heart , William Ingles , just a wee mite aside  --  not so 's y 'd ever known it anyways , but a wee mite ? but I 'll make it up to ye , William , I swear I 'll do that . I 'll come home . I 'll come home , and you and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ones , and we 'll make a new house like our old one , but with two doors ' stead o ' one , and I 'll work ' longside o ' ye in the grain , as I always did , and someday we 'll buy us some good checked flannel and I 'll make ' ee a fine shirt to wear . I 'll come home , Will . I 'm no Shawnee squaw nor French merchant . I 'm Mrs. William Ingles . She began reviewing landmarks in her memory , trying to fix them again , as one tries to remember a waking dream before it fades . I must think of them every day , she advised herself . If they jumble together in my head I 'll have no chance at all . Her heartbeat began to accelerate . I could walk away from here now , she thought . She looked around the trading hut . There were tomahawks and blankets here . There was corn and dried meat . There were moccasins and hides . And there were no two sons or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only things to detain her were the hazards of getting away from the Shawnee town undetected , and getting across the O-y-o , and then those hundreds of unmarked miles to go . . . But how does one cross such a river ? she wondered . Sure there 'd be a canoe unguarded somewhere . But what about food ? What one can carry , long 's it lasts . Then , why , it 'll be fall soon : Nuts and berries , persimmons and paw paws , and game , if I could steal a gun , and then , well , we 'd just have to see . . . But ... She looked down on Bettie Elenor 's head , at the whorl of dark silky hair on the soft skull , and felt the hungry pull at her nipple . She thought of the countless miles of stony river banks and creekbeds , and of the coming cold of autumn .  | A babe would starve as I starved , and freeze as I froze , she thought . She realized that of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape , this delicate and helpless life was the greatest . Surely it would die on the trail . Even more surely than I would die on the trail , she thought . Her vision was clear , free of hope . Her heart was like a bullet . She erased the name Bettie Elenor . The baby at her breast had to become an object to her . Just an object . Her soul was still a huge gaping wound where her sons had been , as if a keen-edged knife had cut away a living part of her . She must see to it now that this infant , this tiny stranger who had joined her in the forest and ridden ever since on her back facing away from her , should not become such a part of her in this hazardous episode that its loss could break her spirit . She returned to her contemplation of the tomahawks and blankets and provisions . Her body was feeling the pull of the long homeward river valleys . She was ready to rise , fill her arms and simply walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and freedom , or to death . " Eh ! La voila ! " It was LaPlante . He and Goulart had returned , with the Otter Girl following them . There would be no walking away from the Shawnee town today . She had sat too long pondering it . Mary reckoned by her calendar of knots that it was midSeptember when Goulart announced the salt-making expedition . She would be in the party , he said . Her heart began thudding . A salt-making expedition might well provide the opportunity to escape . But she hid her eagerness and said nothing . " You . Me . LaPlante and his squaw . The old woman . And men from this town , twelve or twenty I would say , for the canoes and to escort us , " Goulart said , stroking his beard and squinting into the treetops with the effort of speaking English . He was squatting on the earth beside her on his thick haunches as she sewed a final shirt from the exhausted supply of blue and white checked cloth . Mary was beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming familiar and proprietary toward her , as if he were beginning to consider her his squaw now that Wildcat was gone . He had not touched her , nor said anything ungentlemanly , but she had caught him contemplating her with a certain confident satisfaction showing in his face , and he would refer often , as he had just now , to you and me , as if they belonged together . After the division of the prisoners Mary had been moved from the hut she had shared with Bettie to the trading post , where she and Otter Girl and the two Frenchmen slept under the same roof . Goulart continued to call her Madame , and she had suggested several times that he should address her as Mrs. Ingles . Goulart was a virile man of big appetites , for whom it obviously was not easy to be patient , and sometimes she imagined she could smell his desire even through the sourness of his heavy , unwashed body and the leggings and loincloth he never changed , or that she could feel it emanating like heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he would make some sort of advance . If he did , she had sworn to herself , she would kill him . He wore a sheath knife between his shoulder blades on a thong that passed under his left arm and over his right shoulder . She had seen him practice drawing it in idle moments . Acting as if he were merely scratching his scalp or tugging his earlobe , he would , quick as a striking snake , whip his right hand forward ; the long knife would be in it . If he ever tries to embrace me , she had vowed , I will get that knife off his back and stick it between his ribs . She had never contemplated killing before , except in that longago moment when the Indians killed Bettie 's baby , but the abrupt and brutal events of the last two months had built up in her a readiness to strike back quickly at the next person who should try to encroach on her life . They had left her nothing but her own body and soul . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old woman ? " she asked , returning to what he had said . " Oui . Madam Stumf . The great horse . " He snickered . " She is still in this town ? " " Oui . She works like two men . Who would give away such a one ? " Give away , she thought . Selling and trading us like cattle . But a salt-making party ! Not only a better chance to escape , she thought , but the salt lick is much closer to home ! She reviewed her  | memory of the trek down , and recalled that they had reached the salt lick after less than two weeks ' travel from Draper 's Meadows . Dear Lord , she thought , her heart beginning to fill up with hope again , they 'll be taking us halfway home ! If I can escape from them there , why , I can make it home , I know I can ! Mary watched the little whirlpools the paddles made alongside the canoe as the four vessels moved gracefully down the limpid green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrier on her lap , shadows of overhanging sycamore and willow leaves gliding silently over her eyelids . Mary felt as if the quick high pounding of her own heart might awaken the baby . She was going home ! The Indians and the Frenchmen did not know it but they were helping her start her journey home ! She had to lower her face from time to time to hide her sly smile . If they saw her eagerness , surely they would become suspicious of her intent . It was a beautiful day : dry air , deep blue sky , profound green shadows under the great trees along the river banks . Patches of foliage were already yellowing or reddening in some places and their reflections mottled the blue-green surface of the river . Tassels of Indian maize and leaves of tobacco glowed yellow-green in the clearings . The paddles dipped and dribbled . Clouds of birds rose and settled along the shores as the canoes bore down on them . The birds seemed as free and cautious as Mary 's own soul now . From time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her mother 's sweet remembered voice . She thought of her mother talking as she always had with Tommy and Georgie , the buzz and lilt of their voices on a summer 's day . And soon she found herself singing , voicelessly , with her lips only , to the tune of an old favorite ballad of her mother 's : 0 ten times te  --  en times ten a  --  way , But I 'll be home a ? gain . 0 ten times te  --  en times ten a  --  way , I will 0 my Will , 0 my darrr  --  lin ' . . " Ahhh , " Goulart 's voice growled behind her , where he sat wielding a paddle . " La Belle Riviere ! " Mary looked up . There it was now , a broad blue expanse across  | their way , the O-y-o . Her heart leaped again . She saw it as the highway to her freedom . She suppressed a smile , then looked back at him . " What did you say ? " " La Belle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amorous croon . " All Indian names for thees mean ' The Beautiful River . ' Iroquois say ' Oligen-Sipen . ' Delawares say ' Kitono-cepe . ' Wyandottes say ' O-hee-zuh . ' All mean ' The Beautiful River . ' " He looked at her , after the poetic outburst , with such a strange expression , a sort of cow-eyed leer , that she realized he was feeling romantic , and she had to look forward again to keep him from seeing her mirth . But he was right . It was a beautiful river . Its splendor had impressed her even through her terror on the way to the Shawnee town . And now that her heart was full of the promise of escape , this grand stream looked still more benevolent . The shimmering vista widened slowly as the canoes moved down the mouth of the Scioto . Beyond the broad O-y-o , the dark bluffs of the south bank mounted up to loaf-shaped hills of lilac blue . A mere dot on the far shore she made out as the Indian hut where they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canoes sliced into the current of the great stream . The sense of spaciousness was thrilling . A strong , fresh breeze , sweeping up the river from the unknown lands in the west , nudged them as they emerged from the sheltering bluff at the Scioto 's mouth . It whipped her hair about her face . She shifted herself slightly and bent forward to shade the baby 's face from the sun and protect her from the wind , and looked upstream toward the east . Now , ye bloodsoaked heathens , she thought in crafty , silent exultation , just turn left here and head me f'r home ! I sh 'll leave you at th ' salt lick and make my own way thence , thank ' ee kindly . . . The shoreline swung as the canoes began their slow turn . And suddenly the smile froze on Mary 's face , and then melted , and her blood drained out of her head . No . No , wait , now . . . Not that way . . . NOT THAT WAY ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the canoe 's left side with his paddle , looking quizzically at her bewildered expression . " Q'est-que c'est ? "  | It was some time before she could speak . By then the canoes were clearly riding the current downstream toward the west . " I . . . I thought we were going to the salt lick . . . I thought . . . " " Oui . " " But . . . " she moved her lips and found no words . She pointed hack upstream . " Salt . . . " He rested his paddle and pointed downstream . " La bas , " he said . " Much salt . The Lick of the Giant Bones . You will see . Incroyable ! " The statement was nonsense to her . It did not matter . She had been foolish enough to hope again . And now they were not taking her closer to home after all . They were taking her farther away . She sat in the belly of the canoe feeling herself again grow small and hard inside as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark hull that supported her on the surface of the deep eternal water of the great river . After a while she turned halfway to Goulart and asked : " How far ? " He shrugged , looked skyward , translating distances into English in his mind . " Maybe , " he said , " one hundred and fifty , maybe two hundred miles . " He heard her groan . " Have no worry , Madame , " he said . " You are in the care of Goulart . " They went swiftly with the current for four days , and every hour of the passage only tormented Mary , because each league they skimmed over with such ease was a league farther from home . She watched the magnificent wooded bluffs and cane-covered bottomlands glide by and estimated that the canoes were traveling down the river at least three or four times as swiftly as she would be able to walk up its banks . She did not even pretend to join in with the high holiday spirit of the expedition , with Goulart 's clumsy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians ' peaceful good humor . They all seemed to be exhilarated by this effortless float down the beautiful river in the finest weather . But Mary was wrestling with her notions of the possible and the impossible . The summer was drawing to a close . Even if she could somehow manage to escape from this party , and keep herself alive in this steep and tangled wilderness , and find her way back by way of dubious land-  | marks along these rivers , surely such a trek would take as much as two months  --  into the raw and icy weeks of early winter . Her reason told her such a walk would be utterly impossible , even for a strong man , certainly for an unarmed woman . Reason told her that she must stay with the salt party , return with them when they were done , stay in the Shawnee town through the winter , and hope for a chance to escape the next spring . But something as strong as her reason told her that she could not stay with the cruel Shawnees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her existence as a Draper , as the wife of William Ingles . Their family had been devastated and scattered , and unless she and Will could find each other and rebuild the family , there was really no reason to go on living . On the fourth day in the canoes , having traveled generally in a westerly direction , they passed the mouths of three rivers , one pouring into the O-y-o from the north , the next from the south , and the third from the north . " This they call Pio-quo-nee , ' " Goulart said , pointing to the first . " It mean , ah , river of high banks . " Mary made a note of its name and its appearance . She was studying landmarks again . He called the river mouth on the left bank the P-thu-thoi , which Mary remembered was the word for buffalo . And the third river , which they passed in the afternoon , he called La Roque , or stony river . The Indians , he said , called it the Miamizuh . Mary saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further obstacles to any attempt she might make to escape . They were obviously too wide and deep at their mouths to wade . If I was to follow the O-y-o shore , she thought , I sh 'd have to turn up one side of these river mouths and go up that side till I found a shallow place to cross , then come back down t ' other side . That , she realized , would add an inestimable number of miles to a march already impossibly long , and her mind shrank from it . Afternoon shadows were long when the canoes swung close to the left bank and curved into the narrow mouth of a creek . The O-y-o had turned southward during the afternoon , and now the ascent up  | this creek , whose waters had a strange tangy odor , was leading them eastward . The sinking sun at their backs laid a yellow pallor over a strange , desolate landscape before them as they moved up the stream . It was a shallow , swampy valley , the ground on both sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thick scrub . The ground was mucky and full of stagnant puddles . In the shadows , rustlings and splashings told of the flight of many animals . The air grew acrid as the canoes slipped up the sluggish creek . Limbless tree trunks stood rotting at the fringes of the marsh . It looked , Mary thought , like a valley that had sickened and died . About three miles up the valley the paddlers began talking rapidly . The setting sun 's eerie light showed a basin of about ten acres looking more dead and bleached than any landscape Mary had ever seen . The flat ground was chalk-gray , pocked with thousands of hoofprints and footprints , and what appeared to be tree stumps and curved limbs jutted from the low ground . Smelly , murky water oozed up through the morass and dribbled down white rills into the water of the creek . " Voyez ! " cried LaPlante 's voice from another canoe , " the Giant Bones ! " Mary shivered , realizing now that the bleached shapes littering the ground and protruding from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge skulls and ribs , tusks and bones . They were in a vast graveyard of fantastic beasts , beasts even bigger , surely , than the incredible elephant , of which Mary had seen a picture long ago in a bestiary . And now in the leaching twilight she saw that there were , mixed among these gigantic skeleton fragments , the bones and skulls of smaller animals . Near the edge of the creek where the canoes were now being run aground , an elk antler more than four feet long stuck up from the shallows . The Indians quickly set up a camp as the dusk deepened . For Mary and the old woman they made a hasty open-faced shelter by tying buffalo hides to a great curved tusk . Mary lay under the shelter that night nursing her baby , while LaPlante and Goulart sat with the Indians around a roaring bonfire . Goulart was using some enormous skull as a chair . The Frenchmen and the Indians talked long into the night , in  | strange , wondering tones that made her think they were talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they walked . She grew drowsy and pulled her blanket up to cover herself and the infant , and lay there watching the firelight gleam along the arch of the great tusk . She tried to fasten her thoughts to the matter of escape . Instead , her mind roamed back to this strange ghostly place and to the huge animals . Do they still come here ? she wondered . It was curious that she had never heard anyone in her whole lifetime speak of giant animals , except the elephants , which were not on this continent . If they used to come here for the salt , she thought , surely they still do . What would the Indians do if such a beast came walking in during the night , likin ' to crush us underfoot ? she wondered . Maybe that 's why they build such a big fire to sit by , she thought . She went to sleep listening for the tread of gigantic feet , anticipating the trembling of the swampy ground . She awoke once in the night from a dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking and covered with sweat . The roar from her dream was still trailing off through the real night , and she recognized it as the yowl of a wildcat somewhere in the distance . The fire had burned down to red coals . The night air was cold on her sweaty face . A patch of sky sparkled with icy-looking stars . One of the Indian bucks rose from his robe on the ground , stacked more wood on the fire , then lay back down . The wood caught and blazed up with a crackling and fluttering . She smelled its smoke and the rotten smell of the lick and the stale sweat of her own body . She shuddered again . To escape from this circle of firelight into that cold , black , rushing , howling wilderness was unthinkable . At least it was unthinkable in the middle of the night in the middle of a haunted swamp . To LaPlante and Goulart , salt making was business , and so it was obvious that they intended to make much salt . Mary and the widow Stumf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big bone lick and they worked until the sun had set . They scooped out a shallow well at a place where the brine burbled vigorously out of the ground , and here they dipped pails to fill a row of kettles kept  | steaming over hardwood fires on a rise of firmer ground . They also gathered the wood for the fires , and scraped the salt from the bottom of the hot kettles when it was done . A miasma of unseasonal September heat lay over the dismal valley , and Mary found herself constantly sodden with sweat . LaPlante and Goulart occupied themselves with eating and overseeing ; the Indian men usually were out hunting , or sitting in the camp playing a game with toss sticks on a deerhide painted with circles and symbols . Mary gritted her teeth in anger whenever she had to lift a heavy kettle , radiating iron heat , to the tune of the men 's chatter and laughter . Ghetel would see the fury on her face , and would try to mollify her by making comical faces and gestures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though she had worked hard all her adult life as a pioneer wife , had never felt so much like a slave as she did in the operation of this salt factory . Even Otter Girl , who prepared the food and helped tend the fires and the baby , had a leisurely existence compared with that of the two white women . Mary again began to contemplate escape . As she poured brine into a kettle she would see in the steam a scene of poignant beauty : Will and herself , reunited , sitting hand in hand by the willow-shaded spring at Draper 's Meadows . She began to bring up Will 's strong , kindly , bearded face and his broad chest more than ever from her memory into her daydreams . In these long and unclocked hours , everything evoked memories of their life so long ago , so far away . The grainy feel of new-made salt on her hands took her back to the previous autumn , when she and Will had worked shoulder to shoulder , salting a beef for winter . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she could remember it as clearly as if she had stepped back into that season . Johnny Draper had brought the precious salt by horseback over the Blue Ridge to Draper 's Meadows , along with a keg of gunpowder and Bettie his bride . Mary could remember the feel of rubbing the coarse salt into the cold , clammy surfaces of the raw beef , outdoors in the cabin yard on a gray day just a bit above freezing . She could remember the sting of salt in a splinter cut between her thumb and forefinger . She could remember laying the salt-encrusted slabs of meat into a hickory barrel , sprinkling salt over them , then laying on another layer of salted beef , then more salt , until the barrel was nearly full . And she could remember mixing cold springwater with salt into a  | strong brine the next day and pouring it into the barrel until the meat was covered . She remembered Will putting a big , flat , scrubbed piece of creekbed stone on top of the meat in the barrel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barrel with a bigger flat stone to keep raccoons from raiding it , and leaving it all out there in the autumn cold to pickle for a month . And the smell of the hickory smoke here under the salt kettles : It made her remember the little log smokehouse , where Will would then hang up the salt beef with ropes to cold-smoke for three or four days . Oh , all the happy autumn hours and days they had spent , after the harvests , working like one , putting food and firewood by for the winters ! And every fall when they were done , Will would say the same thing : " Mary darlin ' , five cords o ' wood and a heap o ' grain and a good cured beastie do make a man feel rich , 0 yea ! " And when they were in the smokehouse season , Will would always come to bed pungent with hickory smoke . . . Mary shut her eyes and smelled the smoke from the fires under the brine kettles and remembered Will lying next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all the world like a smoked haunch . And she remembered him kissing her in the mornings and rolling onto her for what he called " a bit o ' bawdry " before the children awoke . . . Sometimes just the smell of woodsmoke would make her want Will so badly she 'd get loose in the knees . I wonder how many a woman spends the time I do athinkin ' on her husband . . And the more she dreamed of Will , the greasier and uglier Goulart became , the more repulsive his patient and furtive scrutiny of her seemed . The old woman 's life before her capture had been centered on kitchens . She would tell Mary about the breads and strudels and snickerdoodles she had baked , the souffles , the stews and pot pies , the roast lambs and fowl , the buttermilk pancakes she had made for her big family in the old country . She would describe , in all the detail her poor heavy English could convey , sauces and glazes made of cream and eggs and other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth-watering even in her own guttural  | language simply because of the loving way she spoke the strange words . Sweating over the steamy salt kettles , her rags and wattles gray with ashes , she would create visions of rich and various banquets , then act as if the thought of them were making her faintish , then would knit her brow and complain about the Indian men 's appetite for roast meat . " Uakkkh , " she exploded one afternoon . We must get some good things for a cake , or I die ! " So she harangued the Frenchmen for a few minutes , making them roar with laughter , then came back to Mary . " Come , " she said . " We gather things . " She picked up her blanket and a pail . " To carry , " she said . Mary hoisted the baby onto her back and followed . They wandered out of the valley , onto the wooded slopes . Mary looked back from the brow of a hill and saw the Frenchmen and Indians loafing while Otter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the other slope . There was nothing but forest and meadow . To the west she caught a glimpse of shining water : the 0-y-o . Her heartbeat sped up . It would be so simple to walk away now , she thought . There 's no Shawnee town around us . There are no cornfields and beanfields full of Indians to see me going and raise an alarm . The thought stayed in her mind and grew . Her heart raced . The baby , as if sensing her agitation , began crying . They found a stand of hickory trees . On the ground under them lay hundreds of nuts , their four-sided hulls falling off . Gray squirrels scattered as the women came under the trees to kneel , pry off hulls and toss the hard little yellow-brown nuts onto the blanket . They soon had about five pounds of them . Then they discovered walnuts . They gathered perhaps ten pounds of those , picking up the green balls that had begun to deteriorate and blacken in places and would be easy to hull back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Acorns , " Mary said . " Roast them and they 're wonderful . And I know a way we can make acorn meal in the kettles . " She was growing enthusiastic about their food-gathering now  --  not simply because she desired a variety in the camp menu , as the old woman did , but because she was beginning to see a possibility of staying alive on a long autumn journey through the wilderness .  | The Frenchmen were delighted when Mary and Ghetel staggered back into camp with a pail of wild grapes and a blanket full of nuts , carried like a bag by its corners . They immediately sat down on giant skulls and bones and began cracking hickory nuts with their tomahawks , and picking out the meats with the points of their knives . They went at this with total absorption , munching and exclaiming over the nutmeats , until the Indian men were persuaded to join them . The next day Mary made acorn meal . She shelled a large quantity of the acorns , ground them on a great concave bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she boiled the mass in fresh water and squeezed it out through cloth to leach out the bitterness , and spread it to dry in the sun . That evening Mrs. Stumf used part of the meal to make a delicious pan bread , mixing it with cornmeal and chopped walnut meats and flavoring it with a paste made of the wild grapes . " Ach ! For some sugar or honey , " she groaned as she sampled a crumbly corner of the big cake . " I die for some sweet ! " That was the last she got of her cake . The men devoured it in two minutes . The rest of the evening Mrs. Stumf sulked around the camp with her mouth set tight and a hard edge on her eyelids . In the next two weeks the Frenchmen encouraged Mary and Mrs. Stumf to forage in the countryside and experiment with what they brought in . The women would go out , each carrying a blanket now , and gather all they could carry . The baby cried almost constantly . It seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hush , " Mary said back over her shoulder one day . " Y 're no man , t ' be a-wanting to lay about the camp all the livelong day , good f'r nothin ' ; y 're a woman ! " But the baby still cried . One cloudy evening , foraging on a hillside south of the camp , the women lost their way . They kept getting into thickets they had not encountered on the way out , and were almost frantic by dusk . Suddenly one of the braves appeared before them , so abruptly that Ghetel yelped and dropped her load of edibles . The Indian led them a short mile back to camp . He had come out to look for them when  | they did n't return . He had followed their trail southward out of the camp , then had found them by hearing the baby 's cry . Mary , who was still contemplating escape and had been on the verge of enlisting the old woman to go with her , took note of those facts . Goulart fussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a severe imposition on the men to have to stop their loafing and game playing and nut cracking to go out and search for lost women . The next afternoon , when the kettles were all boiling and the women were about to go into the woods , Goulart came to Mary and handed her a tomahawk . It had a thin hickory handle and a light , sharp steel blade , and a thong looped through a hole in its handle . " Cut a mark on the trees en route , " he said . " Then you find your way back , savez ? " She held the tomahawk and looked at it . Having it in her hand gave her many thoughts . She looked up . " Yes . I 'll do that . " " Goulart does not want to lose Madame , " he said , winking and grinning . He reached around and pinched her haunch . He never suspected how close Mary came that moment to sinking the sharp blade between his eyes . " Ghetel ! " The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rake arrowleaf tubers out of the mud with clawed fingers , turned quickly at the intensity of Mary 's voice . She stood there with muddy water dribbling from her fingers . The chill that went through her was caused not by the cold water she stood in but by the fierce blaze in the eyes of the slender young woman . " Ghetel , listen to me . " " I listen . Wot ? " " I am going to leave . Will you come with me ? " " Hah ! Nah , two more hours daylight . We just started . Help me dig , come . Plenty here . Very good , boiled and salted . " She stooped again . " Ghetel , listen to me ! " " Wot ? I listen ! You go back then . I busy . " " Not back , Ghetel ! Home ! " The old woman straightened up quickly .  | " You said wot ? " " Home . " She pointed eastward . The old woman looked in that direction , then at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " Not too funny , " she said . " No , I mean it . " This time when Ghetel stood up , her face was in a grimace . " You talk mad . Stop this . " " Look . We have blankets . This axe . Shoes . No Indians around . We could go . Just go ! " " Mein Gott ! We would starf ! " " No ! We feed a dozen lazy men on what we find in the woods . " " But they kill meat . This is only added . " " It would feed two of us . " " Mad talk , May-ry Inkles . I dun ' want t ' hear dis . " " I 'll go alone , then . But two of us is better . " " Gott , I dun ' wan ' t ' hear ! " " Do n't holler ! " " Dun ' talk mad , den ! " " I 'm not talkin ' mad ! We could do it ! " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby began to cry . It was upset by their voices . A gust of cool wind blew Mary 's hair across her face and brought a shower of yellow leaves down onto the pond . It was very strange , two white women standing here in the middle of the wilderness shouting at each other while a baby cried . Mary felt how strange it was . Ghetel was grubbing in the mud again , but absently . Her face was still working and she was muttering in her own language . She was thinking about it , Mary knew . She was upset by the notion . " Think of it , Ghetel . You could go home to your kitchen and bake honeycakes . " It was a while before Ghetel said , " I haf no kitchen . No more home . All burn . Ev'rybody dead but me . " " Then come to my family . We have rich land and a good house . " No , we do n't , she reminded herself . It 's all burnt too . But she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us . We have a great , rich house , " she lied . She had threatened to go alone but was deathly  | afraid of that , afraid of the nights , and would say anything to persuade her . The baby was still crying . " Her , " Ghetel said , straightening again and pointing a mucky paw at the baby . " They would hear her and find you . " Mary shook her head . " We 'd be miles a-gone before they knew . We could mark a trail one way and then go back another . I know the way home . By the rivers . " Ghetel was listening in spite of herself , and the admission of an argument was making her angry . Then she shook her head violently . " Nah . The baby would die . She would die first . And then me and then you . " Mary remembered : she had already told herself that . " If we do , we do , " she said . " Better than to live like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I dun ' know . " She blew through her lips like a horse . " No . Maybe . " " Better than this . " " You say so , eh ? " " Aye , I say it . I 'm no slave o ' the heathen , by my Lord God I 'm not ! " She breathed deeply and shivered with the thrill of saying it . " I have to think , " Ghetel said . " Come back to the camp now . We will talk . We will make a plan . " " We canno ' talk there . And there 's not so much time left , " Mary said . " They 'll take us back to the town soon . We could never walk away from there , I 'll vow . " " Such a choice I can only make when I wake up . I would know in the morning . We could each get a blanket . Some food from the camp . A knife , a flint . " " If we took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word suddenly put Mary herself on guard . " Ghetel , if we go to the camp tonight , y 'd not tell ' em what I mean t'do ? " Ghetel 's mouth fell open . She looked as if Mary had slapped her . Then , scowling , she turned abruptly and with a muddy claw pulled open a gap in the back of her tattered dress to expose the ridged welts from her wounds of the gauntlet . Then she drew up into a stance of dignity . " May-ry Inkles , they haf done that to me . " She  | strode out of the border of the pond , her feet sucking mud . She came close to Mary and stared into her eyes with a trembling chin . " Who we haf but each other ? You are all my family now . Gott damns me if I would tell . You hurt me . " Then tears spilled from under her drooping eyelids . Something turned deep inside Mary 's breast and her shrunken heart expanded so suddenly it seemed about to burst . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now she was aware that this was stranger yet : two ragged white women standing beside a pond in the wilderness , hugging and bawling as the infant bawled with them . They stayed apart that evening , with the conspirator 's instinct not to seem conspiratorial . The old woman boiled the arrowleaf tubers and served them with the venison . She had borrowed a knife from LaPlante to trim the tubers before cooking them , and only Mary saw her slip it under the edge of her blanket . I believe , Mary thought , that she 's going to wake up saying yes . Mary was too excited to fall asleep . Her heart pounded interminably as the fires died down and the Indians one by one rolled into their blankets or hides and went to sleep in their lean-tos . LaPlante and Goulart were the last to retire . She heard them mumbling their bon soirs to each other by the last glow of the campfire , then saw them both rise and go their separate ways into the darkness . For a minute then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a puddle nearby . There was a sudden breath of movement directly in front of her ; a dark shape blotted out the starlight and fireglow . Then she smelled the unmistakable rankness of Goulart 's heavy body . He was spreading his blanket inches from where she lay . Without moving , she flared into silent rage . So he had chosen this time and way to move in . Would God I 'd decamped today when I was set to ! she thought . If I have to stick this pig with his own knife I 'll not even get a chance to leave . So it was all up to Goulart now . The cool night creaked with late-season crickets , and Mary lay waiting to do whatever she would have to do .  | Goulart was , to his own mind , an admirably patient gentleman . He believed that for a man of his limited physical attractiveness , patience and plenty of smiling must wear down what a more dashing man might try to break through at once . That had been his experience ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the riverways of New France , his rare successes with white and Creole women had been achieved that way . When they had become familiar with him , they had allowed him to edge closer until , usually , they would permit him . With Indian squaws , of course , it had been a different matter , depending on the cultural traditions of the village chiefs . But Goulart had been even more patient than usual with this fair woman from the Virginia mountains . There was nothing in the least saucy about her , and she had showed no sign yet of needing or wanting any man . Surely she would eventually , he was sure , as she was a woman . He had tired of waiting , though , and tonight he had made his first delicate advance . He had moved his bed next to hers . If she did not wake up tonight and respond , in whatever way , she would find him there in the morning , and would have to get accustomed to sleeping next to him . After that . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his , and if nothing else , why then , when he was disposed to wait no longer , he could simply force his rights . But that was not a good way to start . He rolled off his back and lay on his left side facing her . He thought about laying his right arm over her , and then did that . He thought he felt her stiffen . But she did not move , and her breathing did not change . He considered exploring her bosom . But he was really very tired . And his left hip was bothering him . He was getting old-men 's bones at . an early age . After a while he rolled onto his back and then onto his right side , facing away from her . At last he was snoring . Mary relaxed and went warm with a rush of relief . Thank God the man had not been bolder this night . He 'll not have a second night , little does he know . She guessed this about Goulart : He wanted the Indians to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bedding next to hers so that they would see at daylight  | that he was sleeping beside her . After that they would expect him to sleep with her and it would not matter what she felt about it because she would seem to have allowed it now . Then here is how we sh 'll deal with Mister Goulart 's presumption , she thought . And in the pink-silver light before dawn while the camp was still asleep , Mary silently arose , gathered up her baby and blanket , stepped softly out of the lean-to and over Goulart 's snoring bulk , and went to the high ground near the kettles , spread her blanket there , lay down and covered herself and shut her eyes . Thank God this is the last night I sh 'll have to outwit this swine , she thought . Such could become a very annoying game right soon . She did not go back to sleep after moving her bedding . She had a decision to make .  | T was the most enormous decision she had ever faced in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had to make such a decision . To turn her mind directly to it created a great awful hollowness in her breast . Either of her two alternatives was unthinkable , but she had to choose one . She had to choose one now . She had thought around and around it for weeks , and now there was no more time . She knew that to take the baby with her would be to condemn it to a slow and wretched death . It was not a question of whether or not she could carry the baby . She would gladly have borne its little weight the five or six hundred miles ahead  --  if there were any chance that it might survive . But there was no chance . It would starve while Mary starved . Ghetel had known that too . And if its crying did thwart their escape , she and the baby surely would be put to death together . There was no question about that , either . Only by being left in the camp , in the care of the Otter Girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and care for it . She already adored it with a full motherly passion . She pined for it on the days Mary took it with her on foraging trips , and would rush to take it in her arms on their return . To leave the baby with Otter Girl was the only humane choice . Yet it was as unthinkable as carrying it away to suffering and sure death . How could a mother ever say that she had abandoned her  | infant to savages ? One could relate the circumstances and show why it had been the baby 's only way to live , but the awful fact would remain in anyone 's mind that here was a woman who had left her I infant in the hands of heathens . Her decision was that she would leave the baby here . Give it a chance for life . It could live a tolerable life as an Indian , never having known another kind of life . The Indian squaws , as far as Mary had been able to observe , were as content with their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than some . You are happy or not happy insofar as you belong , she thought . The Shawnees know they belong and to them it is everything . I do not belong to the Indians because I know I do not . This babe would not know such a thing . And so she would leave the baby . She had known , really , for weeks that she would leave it . That was why she had allowed herself recently to think of the baby only as it instead of as she or as Bettie Elenor . Mary had been preparing herself for something like this from the moment of the poor creature 's birth on the forest floor . There was , of course , a possibility that the baby might die even if Mary left it in the camp . If the Indians should guess that she was escaping deliberately , they likely would be angered to dash its brains out or throw it in a kettle of boiling brine . So they must believe I just got lost , she thought . If they think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a panther got me , then they wo n't take it out on the baby . I must make it appear that I did not flee , she thought . That 's the best I can do for this little thing . Nay , it 's the only thing I can do . She looked down at the infant , whose eyes were open now , and had to look away . She could not permit herself to look at its eyes . She bared her breast and gave her nipple to it and the baby shut its eyes and sucked . Mary made her heart small and hard and cold again . At midmorning , while they were gathering firewood , Mary had her opportunity to talk alone with the old widow . Before she could ask , Ghetel answered : " Thank you I did not sleep an hour the night long . I think all  | night . I say , yes , no , yes , no . By the dawn time I am so weary I say , no , no , no ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Comes the sunrise , I look at you , I know you are going to go , and I say , yes . And that is it . Yes ! Might be I hate you for it . But I go . Because I can not eat Shawnee food all the rest of my life . " She grinned . Then the grin melted and her eyes became intense . " And because I can not let May-ry Inkles go out there alone . " Mary told her why the Shawnees must believe they had gotten lost . And she told her of her decision about the baby . She felt as if she were exposing the most awful corner of her soul . She almost hoped the old woman would plead with her to bring the infant along . Then she waited for Ghetel 's response , for an expected repugnance in her expression . The old woman looked at her for a full minute , a succession of feelings reflecting in her face . Finally she put her hand on Mary 's wrist . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even with mine own , I would do this . " " My knife ! " LaPlante exclaimed suddenly . He and Goulart were sitting on mammoth bones next to each other , cracking walnuts with their tomahawks , and when LaPlante had reached for his knife to use as a nutpick he had found the sheath empty . A shiver went down Mary 's back . She remembered that Ghetel had kept and hidden the knife the day before . LaPlante was on his feet , complaining in both French and Shawnee . It was a trivial incident but one that , Mary knew , might rouse suspicions in the camp and prevent them from going out foraging . Her heartbeat quickened and she threw a concealed glance to see what Ghetel was doing . The old woman appeared to be thinking very hard but was remaining calm . What if they find the knife under her blanket ? Mary thought . God , they 'll watch us like buzzards if they do . LaPlante asked something of Otter Girl , and she merely cocked her head and raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp in agitation , looking everywhere , turning things over with his foot . Now he was going toward the lean-to where the old woman 's bedding was .  | " Mister , " Mary called . " Look by the cooking pots yonder . W were there cutting arrowleaf yesterday . Like as not it 's right there on the ground . " " Ah , je me souviens , " he muttered , and went toward the kettles . Goulart went back to his walnuts . Mrs. Stumf was trying to go , as , unobtrusively as her big form would allow , toward her bedding . Sheri ; moved with such exaggerated stealth that anyone seeing her would , have known she was up to something devious , so Mary went to distract Goulart 's attention . He looked up suddenly when he saw the elusive object of his desires approaching him . She smiled . " For a favor , " she said , holding out the tomahawk he had given her for blazing trees . " This is dull . It don ' cut very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walnuts . What say y ' to trade f'r the day ? Why , maybe y ' could sharpen this'n up f'r me while I 'm gone . That 'd be a nice favor . " She tried to keep her voice pleasant but natural and not to glance at Ghetel . Inside she was quaking . A cocky smile slowly established itself on Goulart 's face , which had been sullen ever since he had awakened this morning to find Mary gone from his side . Obviously he now thought Mary was just , being a coquette . " But of course , there Madame ! " he said gallantly , and gave her his tomahawk and took hers . " Oh , thankee . Try that one on a walnut . . . it 's nice and heavy As he bent to place a walnut , Mary saw Ghetel sneaking toward , the cookpots . The old woman dropped the knife on the ash-covered ground , stepped back and then walked about stooping as if searching the ground . " Here , M'shoo ! " Ghetel bellowed gaily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knife up from where she had dropped it and held it up for him . He broke into smiles and went to her and took it , making pleased noises in his sinuses . Mary 's heartbeat slowed and she had to hold her breath to keep from sighing out loud . That was enough . She had a feeling that if they did not leave immediately , something else like this was going to come up and prevent them . " Mrs. Stumf , " she said cheerfully , hoping not too cheerfully , " what say y ' to goin ' after that hickory grove we seen yonder . . . " She pointed southward . " . . and I saw lots of sassa-i 1  | ras . Mr. Goulart gim me a tommyhock sharp enough to cut sassafras oot with ! " " ' Eyyy ! Gut ! " Ghetel exclaimed , perhaps a little too eagerly . " Well , then , let 's be about it , " Mary said . Her voice sounded strained and unnatural to her ; her heartbeat seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she hoped the Indians and Frenchmen would not notice the strain in her voice ; surely they would sense that something was happening . She went , as usual , to roll up her blanket and sling it over her shoulder . Ghetel did the same . LaPlante and Goulart were still whacking away at walnuts , and most of the Indian men were playing their game or maintaining their guns . Now , Mary thought . Just turn your back on it and go . Do n't go look at the baby ; y 'll get all upset and they 'll suspect something . Do n't look at the baby ! But she went to look at the baby . There was no such thing as not going to look at the baby . Fortunately , it was asleep . Its eyes were shut . Otter Girl sat beside it mending a moccasin , chewing the leather to soften it until she could ease the point of a bone needle into it and draw a rawhide thong through . She looked up , a smile of utter contentment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infant , her back to the Otter Girl . She lowered her face as close as she could without touching the baby and awakening it . Just an inch from it . She inhaled the baby smell and suddenly her heart clenched mightily and the baby 's dark little eyelashes and tiny features blurred beyond a flood of tears and Mary 's arms ached to grab up the little living bundle and run with it , run all the way back to Draper 's Meadows without stopping . Her hot tears were dropping on the baby 's forehead and would awaken it ; little frowns were disturbing its face and its little beak of an upper lip sucked in the soft red lower lip . Mary could n't stop herself . She kissed the little mouth and then , with anguish that surely would kill her , she rose to her feet and stumbled , tearblinded , to the edge of the camp , her lungs quaking for release , her throat clamped to hold down the awful wail of despair that was trying to erupt . The old woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her livid , contorted face , was so stricken by its agony that she too had to force back a wail of misery . Oh dear God help me ! Mary 's heart felt the way her loins had felt  | when the baby was being born . But ten times worse . Ten times ten times ten times worse . Oh dear God help me ! HELP ME ! HELP ME ! They were far into the woods before she could see or hear or feel , , anything , and what she became aware of first was the old woman 's , , strong arm across her back helping her along , all but carrying her : ; 1 She stopped her on a slope covered with tan dead leaves amon. gigantic beech and poplar trunks . She knelt and pulled her dow and muffled her face with her blanket and started patting her back. , ; . " Now , " she said . " Dey can not hear you now . Cry up ! Do it ! " It was an hour before Mary could get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as bad as she had been on the day when they had taken Tommy and Georgie away from her . She stood leaning against Ghetel , who was still patting her lightly on the back . " I thought I 'd got myself ready for this , " Mary strangled . " Who could ? " the old woman replied . " We could still go back . " No . Do n't even say it . " They wandered in no particular direction at first , barking tree with the tomahawk to leave a confusing trail . Then they came to a small clear brook and stepped into it barefoot , carrying their shoes , and went westward toward the O-y-o . The water was very cold . After a mile the brook wandered into the salt valley and emptied into the salt creek , some distance below the camp . They waded to its other shore , dresses pulled up waist-high , then walked in the odorous muck at the creek 's edge , the creek water dissolving their footprints as they stepped out of them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the foliage on the slopes nearby was still green , but a dry , yellowing green , and here and there were boughs and crowns of red and purple foliage . " Ach . The riffer . " It opened up before them , ablaze with mirrored afternoon sunlight . The creek deepened and they had to climb out onto its bank to make the last hundred yards to the river . They stood and looked at it for a moment only . Its damp flowed around them on a breeze . " So now ? " Ghetel whispered . Mary looked up the east bank of the O-y-o and dipped her head . Her sight was still fuzzy with tears and her eyes were red . She felt as  | if the first step would take the little strength left in her . " Along ? iere , " she said . " For a long , long way . " She sighed , stooped to put on her shoes , then picked up the blanket and tomahawk and they started walking through the reeds and shrubbery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blades of grass whispered around their ragged skirts and slashed at their bare shins . The reflected sunlight from the river was hot on the left sides of their faces . Huge dragonflies hovered and drifted away . The foliage of cottonwoods and willows and locusts shivered and hushed in the river breeze alongside their way . Birds rose , dipped , shrilled , skimmed close over the water . Mary looked at them now and then and gradually began to think of freedom . Through the deep lonely misery of her soul the thought came to her that for the first time in more than two months she was not a captive of the Indians  --  not a slave . Her legs overcame their heavy reluctance and began to like this walking . She heard the old woman 's heavy breathing and crashing , thumping footsteps behind her , and an occasional Dutchy oath . " Step light , Ghetel . We must go far as we can afore night . " Mary felt a curious , soaring sensation in her breast as she said this . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Will . Just before sunset a towering line of grim clouds crawled up from the southwest . Thunder grumbled , lightning flickered on the horizon , and as the clouds climbed , a blast of damp air shivered the surface of the river and turned the leaves of the forest white side up . Soon the thunderheads dominated the whole sky above the river ; they came gliding across , their undersides lowering and dragging gray veils of rain under them . Birds and insects fell silent . In the moment of stillness as the rainfall came sweeping toward them across the river , Mary heard , or rather , felt , the stroke of a distant gunshot on the charged air . She stopped and raised a hand , and Ghetel almost blundered over her . They stood and listened for a moment , and she thought she detected another , then another , and one or two that were dubious because they were lost in the muttering of thunder . " Eh ? " Ghetel queried.  | " Do n't rightly know , " Mary said . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp . " Not hunting , surely , afore a storm like now . " Were they killing the baby ? Not likely with a lot of gunshots , she decided . " No , I 'd reckon they think we 're lost , and 're tryin ' to signal us the way back . " It seemed the best explanation , and Mary smiled with a cunning satisfaction . And then the sting of blown rain peppered them and hissed up the shore and into the trees . " Ach ! Nab ! " Ghetel complained . " No , it 's good , " Mary exclaimed . " Come . With this , we 'll leave no trail f'r ' em to pick up come morning ! They 'll just think a bear got us , or lightnin ' or sump'n , an ' wo n't even try t ' find us , I 'll wager ! " She was almost running now , feeling free , and cleansed of the degradation of her bondage by this pelting torrent . She could hear Ghetel huffing and slogging along behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The forest and river turned white and the sky cracked open along a tortuous blue-white seam for an instant ; a tree flashed and exploded a few yards ahead and a bolt of noise felled Mary to her knees . The tree smoked and a strange , fresh , ' exhilarating smell came through the air . Mary got to her feet again as the echoes of the bolt dwindled across the river . " Lightnink will ! " the old woman wailed . They were drenched by the time the rain had passed and the thunder bumped away in the east . It was too dark by then to continue safely along the unknown terrain of the shore . The wool of their blankets was heavy with water , and their sodden dresses hung cold on their skin . Mary estimated they had come perhaps five miles since reaching the river . Now that they had stopped in the dripping , dribbling gloom , the warmth of their exertions evaporated at once and their empty stomachs gave them no warmth . Mary remembered then that in the anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a grim and shivery night , and despite their exhaustion they likely would get no sleep at all . They peered and groped until they found a level and relatively well-drained place under a natural bower , where the old leaves of past years had drifted . They stood facing each other and twisted their blankets between them to squeeze out the water , then draped It  | the blankets over themselves and squatted beside each other for a moment . Mary 's teeth chattered and she trembled from end to end . Even the primitive salt camp seemed cozy and luxurious compared with this . " We 've a hard night ahead , I fear . I 'm sorry . We 'll do as best we can , eh ? Come daybreak we 'll find us some nuts or pawpaws or sump'n , eh ? " " Take , " Ghetel said . " Eh ? " The old woman reached for Mary 's hand and put something cold and mushy in it . She explained , " It vaz bread , til the rain . I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass . Mary could taste hickory nuts and acorn meal in it with the corn . It was delicious . She licked her fingers and felt a degree warmer inside . They shook and trembled in their wet blankets for an hour , listening to the flow of the river and the dripping foliage , the whippoorwills and crickets and each other 's sighs . Mary was so wretched she could hardly even think of the absence of her baby . " May-ry , " the old woman croaked . " Aye ? " " Come . " And when they lay body to body , even the damp blankets could not entirely douse the warmth they gave each other , and eventually they slept through a night they had expected to be sleepless.  | SOMETHING was happening . Mary was jolted out of sleep by her own heartbeat , by the sound of rustling in the leaves mere inches from her head . The old widow was moving , rising , cautiously , lifting the blanket . Mary opened her eyes in the green dimness and groped for the tomahawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghetel surged behind her , grunted , dragged the blanket off and scrambled in the leafy thicket . Something scurried away through rustling leaves and the old woman expelled a breathy oath . Heart walloping , Mary turned to see the widow on all fours , staring into the underbrush . The blanket hung from her hips and entangled her feet . Mary had to swallow her heart before she could ask what had happened . " Almost got a meat for breakfast , " sighed the old woman . " Almost in mine hands ! Ach , for a gun ! " " We 'd dare not shoot one if we had it . What kind of animal ? " They were both kneeling on the bottom blanket and the old woman I was extricating herself from the clinging grasp of the other . She did I not know what the animal was called , she said , but her efforts to describe it convinced Mary that she had nearly grabbed either a raccoon or a badger , which had been sniffing curiously at them while they slept . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mary + exclaimed . " Such beasties as them would ' a ' chawed y'r arm up ' fore I could ' a ' put the tommyhawk on ' im ! I swear , Ghetel , that appetitie o ' your'n will be the death of us ! "  | Ghetel seemed to understand now , and perhaps was relieved that the animal had escaped her clutches . " But I do like breakfast , " she growled as they moved out of the thicket to the river bank , their blankets draped over their shoulders like capes . They eventually did find a breakfast . Veering straight north inland to save distance at a place where the river elbowed , they found not only a good fall of hickory nuts , but a pair of paw-paw trees , small but heavily laden . They shook down all the firm yellow-green fruits they could dislodge , and bound them up in a blanket to bring along . On the ground under the trees they found a dozen that had fallen and turned brown with ripeness and gave up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dredged out the soft , sweet yellow pulp with their fingers , moaning with pleasure as they worked it over their tongues and sucked it off the big brown seeds and swallowed it . In a few minutes they were full and sticky , and permeated with the cloying odor of the stuff . They washed their hands and faces at a cold brook and struck out to regain the bank of the O-y-o , bringing the paw-paw aroma with them . The day was overcast and the ground remained soft from the night 's rain . Mary looked over her shoulder constantly as they moved along . Even though she was certain the rain had destroyed their traces near the camp , she knew they were leaving a spoor that would be easy to follow if the Indians had chanced onto it this morning . They rested on a stone ledge at the riverside early in the afternoon , breaking and munching hickory nuts . Mary 's breasts ached for the baby 's lips , and to keep from thinking about it , she talked optimistically about their progress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'd not ha ' got away from the Shawnee town , " she mused aloud . " All those people . And dogs . No dogs at the salt camp , thanks be t ' God . " But the best o n't is , we 're on th ' right side o ' the river . I do n't know how ever we 'd ha ' crossed it , short of stealin ' a canoe . And I f'r one deem the heathens handier at stealin ' than bein ' stole from . " Late that afternoon as they labored eastward along the bank of the O-y-o , Mary recognized on the opposite shore the mouth of the river that Goulart had called . . . she searched her memory for the French  | word , but remembered only that it meant " the stony river " and that the Indians called it the Miami-zuh . She recalled that they had passed it in the afternoon of their last day coming down , and thus reckoned that she and Ghetel had walked some fifteen or twenty miles up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberation . Fifteen or twenty miles , she thought . It sounded good ; they had done well indeed . But then she remembered all the days of coming down on horseback from Draper 's Meadows  --  the month of days ? when they had made perhaps fifteen or twenty miles a day mounted , and then the four swift days by canoe from the Shawnee Town to the salt creek ; and suddenly the distance they had struggled today seemed but a tiny first step on the long way home . Why , they would have to walk this far every day for a month and a half or two months to get home ! And this O-y-o valley , strenuous though it was , was gentle by comparison with the terrain they would meet along the New River through the Alleghenies . But come now , she told herself . Y 'll do no good thinkin ' discouragements o ' this sort ! A day is a day , and y 'll take each as it comes . If't requires two months o ' days , that 's little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ! They were famished by nightfall , and ate three more of the pawpaws apiece . Their blankets had dried during the day , and the evening was mild , so they did not have to huddle together for warmth . Each rolled up in her own blanket  --  redolent of paw-paw now , almost sickeningly so  --  and lay in her private hopes and fears in the creaking , hushing , owl-hooting darkness above the murmuring river , letting the burning aches in her legs and back subside into an aching torpor of the flesh , then into numbness , and slid off into a sleep haunted by space and uncertainty . They foraged for almost an hour the next morning , staying within sight of the river , but found nothing they recognized as edible . They had several pounds of paw-paws left , but by now their senses were so permeated by their over-sweet odor that the thought of eating one was nauseating . Ghetel wanted to range further inland , up the slopes into high ground where nut trees might be found , and Mary had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance  | upriver . Ghetel came along , a bit grimly ; evidently she had meant it when she said she appreciated breakfast . They slogged along through brushy bottomlands , wading small creeks and marshes , climbing slopes on all fours , struggling through brambles that ripped their tattered skirts and drew blood from their legs ; by early afternoon they were gasping for breath and slapping at huge brown flies whose bites were fierce as bee-stings , and were so famished that the paw-paws were delectable again . And suddenly , after perhaps twelve miles , they emerged from a densely wooded downslope to find their way blocked by the mouth of a river that flowed into the O-y-o . Mary remembered this one . The word for buffalo . This was the river Goulart had pointed out to her as the Buffalo River . It was far too wide and apparently too deep to try to cross here . Ghetel 's face drooped in dismay and she sat down abruptly on the ground in a slumping posture of defeat , sweat dripping off the end of her shapeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt . But she had , of course , already considered such detours as this . " Eh , well , " she said with a wan and unconvincing smile , and pointed up the bank of the tributary with her tomahawk , " let 's us jus ' stroll up this side a stretch till we find a fordin ' place . " Mrs. Stumf just sat and gazed , slowly shaking her head . Mary feared that if she sat there musing on it too long , she might consider turning back to the relative comfort and security of the salt camp . So she grabbed her hand and , with false gaiety , tugged at her until the old woman sighed and got to her feet . Mary sang softly as they went along : 0 ten times te  --  en times ten a  --  way , But I 'll be ho  --  ome a  --  gain . . But they spent the rest of that evening and all the next day going up the shore of the tributary , farther and farther from their guideway the O-y-o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five , ten , maybe twenty miles , for all they knew , only for the purpose of returning to a point a stone 's throw away from where they had stood . It was almost as disheartening as going backwards . But there was nothing for it but to do this ; neither of them could swim . They were exhausted , hungry , scratched and bruised when , late  | on their fourth day out of the salt camp , they came to a riffle that indicated a shallows . The branches of trees almost met over the river here , producing such a deep green gloom that they were unwilling to try a crossing before the next morning  --  especially in their spent condition . They piled leaves between two parallel fallen logs and spread their blankets . They went down to the river 's edge and forced themselves to eat the rest of their paw-paws , which by now were so ripe and familiar as to be almost revolting . And the steady diet of paw-paws and more paw-paws and nothing else had given them both a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet away , squatted with the hem of her skirt drawn up around her waist and discharged her bowels into the leaves with a loud gushing , spurting noise and came back with a distasteful expression on her face . A few minutes later Mary felt the call and went away to do the same . She did not like this . It was her experience that the flux had a weakening effect , and they would need all the strength they could maintain . Something with heavy footsteps and deep wet breathing snuffled and grunted around them for almost an hour after midnight , waking them and then leaving them in such a state of fright that they did not sleep again until almost dawn . They were sure it was a bear , and sat up , back to back , Mary gripping the tomahawk , ready to defend themselves blindly in the darkness . When Mary heard Ghetel snore , she at last gave in to her own weariness and they both dozed sitting up until they were awakened by the shrilling of some woodland bird and glimpsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the river . They wanted some strength for their attempt to ford the river , and so occupied themselves with searching for food until the light strengthened , pausing often to spew the scalding , fluid contents of their bowels onto the ground . The memory of their helpless fright during the long night caused Mary to think she should try to fashion some sort of weapons for them . Appreciating the properties of hickory , she found two arrow-straight saplings , about two inches in diameter at their bases , cut them down with the tomahawk , . shaved off the bark , cut them to lengths of about seven feet and then whittled their heavy ends to spear sharpness . This arming somehow heartened them for the crossing of the river .  | Mary led the way into the cold , swift water , feeling the slick , rounded stones with her bare feet , probing ahead for depth and bracing herself against the current with the blunt end of her hickory spear , while the old woman clung desperately to the back of her dress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With every additional inch of depth they reached , her toes ' traction on the slippery stones became more tenuous , and the certainty that they would be simply carried off their feet and swept into the relentless stream to drown became more definite , more dizzying . The river , which she had estimated at fifty feet wide , now seemed as broad as the O-y-o . The flow was generally only thigh-deep , but when she would step into a muck-and-pebble depression and feel the current tugging at her hips and waist , the end of the whole ordeal would seem to lie inches away in the watery void at her left . She seemed to have been looking at the same exposed roots on the far bank for hours when they suddenly were there in her hand and then she was scrambling up the bank with river water dribbling out of her skirt . " Ahhhhh HEEE ! " Ghetel roared with joyous relief . Unseen animals went rustling away across the leafy floor of the woods . They had made it . They were exhausted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other on the back and laughing almost hysterically in their triumph . They subsided eventually , and paused to wring out their skirts and the ends of their blankets , sighing and shuddering . Mary took note of her belt then , and decided she should keep a calendar of the days of their return , as she had of her descent . She counted back . This was the fifth day since their flight from the salt camp , so she tied a triple knot to mark the beginning of their trek and then four more single knots . Ghetel , meanwhile , was expressing her familiar concern : " Hungry , " she said . " I need a breakfast . " So they made a brief excursion up the slopes to look for food , being careful to keep the river in view . Mary was anxious to get back down the east bank of this river and rejoin the O-y-o . She was worried about being out of sight of it . High on the slope , where an old burn-over was covered with scrub and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vines clinging to the small trees as if trying to haul them down and strangle them . The grapes were small , hardly bigger than  | peas , but were in such dense bunches that it was only a few minutes ' work to fill a blanket with them and tie up its corners . Then they picked more and sat on the ground nibbling the powerfully bittersweet grapes off their stems . They chewed up the seeds too , finding the grapes more filling this way . Thus filled , but left strangely half-satisfied for lack of bread or meat , they scrambled back down the slope to the river bottom and followed it northward toward the O-y-o . At midday , the weather close and overcast , when they were perhaps a fourth of the way back down the shore of the tributary , they were dismayed to find still another obstacle before them : a deep , wide creek flowing across their path into the river . Mary sighed . They would have to make a detour from their detour . This was worse even than she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , though they probably had walked sixty or seventy miles , they had progressed no more than thirty miles toward home , because of these necessary digressions from their route . In truth , she thought , because of these damnable side-trips , we 're probably further from home now than when we escaped ! But no . Looking at it that way will only drive you mad . This unexpected creek had added five or six miles to their trek by the time they had made their way up its south bank , crossed it on a fallen ash tree that had bridged it and then hiked and crawled back down its north shore to rejoin the Buffalo River . And thus by nightfall they still had not raised sight of the O-y-o . It was midmorning of their sixth day of freedom before they stood , weary and weakened by their flux , on the banks of the O-y-o again , now above the mouth of the Buffalo River . These last two and a half days , Mary thought , have brought us a hundred yards closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost like a joke . But it was a joke she decided not to tell to Ghetel . The old woman was having enough trouble keeping heart as it was . " Eh , now ! " Mary exclaimed with a dreadful false jollity . " That wee diversion 's done with . Now we 've an easy road ahead f'r a good spell ! "  | ALONG a ridge crest deep in the Tennessee country , four horses picked their way over a stony game trail among dark pine trees . On the lead horse was the half-breed guide , Gander Jack , who was now dressed in the Indian mode . Gander Jack spoke English and Cherokee and frequently in his forty-one years had passed between Roanoke and the Cherokee towns south of the Cumberland . He was one of the few men who knew the way to the towns of the Southern Nations , and so had been hired as a guide at considerable expense by Will Ingles , who rode on the horse immediately behind him . Johnny Draper was on the third horse , leading a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirrors , glass beads , combs and small tools to be used as gifts and ransom . Gander Jack had suggested they bring rum , but Will had been opposed to it ? first because he suspected it was prompted by Jack 's own considerable thirst , and second because he did not believe that rum was conducive to levelheaded dealings with Indians . At length , though , Will had conceded and brought a few gallons of whiskey , which he guarded closely . They reached the end of the ridge and began to descend through a copse of junipers , emerging then on a clear slope overlooking a vast and brilliant stand of mountain ash : a profusion of small yellow leaves and stark red berries . Cedar waxwings , bluejays and finches shot to and fro among the ashes , feasting on the berries . On the  | distant slopes , forests of dark evergreens stood among the fading hardwoods , while shadows of clouds slid slowly up the valleys . The riders converged with a narrow mountain stream about halfway down the slope , a gushing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so steep that the horses all but slid down on their rumps . In half an hour then they rode out onto a gentle , U-shaped valley full of dry grass and pine growing in reddish earth . Here they could ride abreast . They went at a trot for an hour , their eyes shaded by their wide , three-cornered hats . Gander jack wore a yellow bandana circled around his head . His hat hung behind his shoulder on a strap . Jack pointed ahead , and Will noticed a haze of smoke hanging along a wall of dark pines a mile ahead . " Cherokee town there , " Jack said . He reined in his horse ; Will and John did the same , though uncertain why . After a full minute of listening and watching , Jack clucked his tongue and they moved forward again , but at a slow walk . Will had broken out in a sweat in the still heat and ominous quiet . And suddenly , in the corners of his eyes , he detected the movement of figures . Glancing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay across his saddle , he saw that they were flanked by perhaps a dozen warriors on foot , some of them armed with bows and hide shields , others with guns . These were escorting them toward the town . It was eerie how they had materialized out here on this open space . They rode in among pines and the smell of woodsmoke , and found themselves suddenly within a clean , orderly village of remarkably substantial log houses , some bigger than his own home in Draper 's Meadows had been , roofed with split wood . Stick-and-clay chimneys showed that the dwellings even had fireplaces . Handsome , brown-skinned young women , naked from the waist up , working at grain mortars and kettles and looms in the pleasant shade alongside the road , paused and stood up to watch these white men ride in . Children wearing not a stitch paused in their play and looked in awe at what Will presumed were the first white men they had ever seen . A clear stream curved in toward the heart of the town , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impressed by the air of peace and order . He turned to look aside at Johnny , who caught his eye at once and remarked :  | " Nice town , ai n't it ? " Looking back , Will saw now that much of the population had moved in behind them , following quietly and watching with great curiosity . " Chief , " Gander Jack said softly , and Will turned to see a wellformed old man with grizzled hair coming toward them down the sun-flecked street , carrying a long walking staff with white and yellow feathers at its tip . Jack raised his hand to him and reined in . The chief returned the salute , and Jack dismounted , stood before him and offered his hand . They clasped forearms and Jack began talking . The chief nodded , his quick eyes occasionally darting up to look at the white men . " Get down , " Jack said . He do n't like you a-lookin ' down on ' im . " They slid off , eager to please . Will and Johnny and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool structure with a high ceiling , and there they smoked a pipe with the chief and- some leading men of the town . They ate a meal from a large bowl containing beans and squash flavored with strips of a meat they could not identify by taste . Gander Jack was canny enough to wait until they had finished before telling them it was dog . Will felt a twinge of nausea , then put it out of his mind and forgot about it . The Cherokee chief was reserved but hospitable . He listened as Will described , with Jack translating , the massacre at Draper 's Meadows and told of his hope that the hostages might be located in the Shawnee country and ransomed through the offices of the neutral Cherokees . He told of the gifts of great beauty that he could bestow upon both the Shawnees and the Cherokees if his beloved family were returned to him . The chief listened to all this with his eyes hooded , and if his soul was stirred at all by the mention of the presents , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then stood up . " He 's never had a chance to talk directly to Englishmen , " Gander Jack said . " He has a few things on his mind and wants you to listen . " Johnny leaned close to Will , smiling with half his mouth . " What say y ' , Will ? Shall we hear ' im out ? " " Ca n't say as I 've got anything more pressing t'do . Tell him , "  | Will said to Gander Jack , " that we deem ourselves lucky to share his wisdom . " Gander Jack let the chief get a few seconds ' head start talking , then stepped in at his first pause for breath and began translating : " He says he 's seen his cousins the Shawnees two times this year . . and they 've told him what 's in their hearts . . . " The Shawnees took up the tomahawk against the English white men because they 've been drove from place to place by ' em . They used to live a good life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English white men came close and made big farms and killed all the game . . . " Then they had to move west and find new lands , on the O-y-o , because more white English came . . . " He says he understands the hearts o ' the Shawnees . . . that he himself got wary when he saw your white faces come today . . He fears that the Cherokee nation may one day have to fight the white English too , to keep from being driven afore ' em . . . " He says the Shawnees wo n't give up their captives easy . He wants you to understand that they take captives and adopt them into their families to replace people who been killed or died because of the white men coming . .. " 7t , " Ask him if that means they 're likely alive , " said Will . Jack exchanged words with the chief , then told Will : " That 's up to the families . They 're given a captive to replace someone they 've lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torture or kill that prisoner to have revenge . But if they believe that person is of good blood , they 'll adopt him , or her , and give the same comfort and protection they gave their own . " Will and Johnny traded anxious glances . Then Will extended another question that had been bothering him . " Ask him why the Shawnee , if they hate white men so dang much , hire on with the French . They 're just as white as we are . " The chief was not stumped for a second by that question . " He says , " replied Jack , " that the French are different from you . They hunt and trap and fish , just like the Shawnee , and they make small villages like the Indians , and farm only for food to eat themselves . .. He says they do n't try to drive the red man out and destroy his land and kill all the game . He says the French and the Indians can  | live side by side in a land and help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , and that 's why the Shawnees use the help o ' the French . . . " At this point the chief sat down . A buck , at a signal , brought forth the pipe again , with coals to light it , and it was passed around . Then the chief began talking again , this time with a less pontifical demeanor . " He says he 's glad you come to see him . He thinks y 're brave to come here alone and your reasons are kindly . The Cherokee , too , love their families , and would do as you do . . . He says he 'd like to help you ransom your families , and he 'll say good words for you to any Shawnees who come here . But he says it ai n't likely any will . Wait ... " The chief talked again , and waved toward the southwest . He tells me there was a Cherokee named Snake Stick , from a village out yonder , came through here two days back , an ' this ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk with the Shawnees afore winter . He says if Snake Stick ai n't gone yet , y ' might hire him as y'r go-between . " Will 's eyes blazed with eagerness . " How far to this Snake Stick feller ? " " I know where his town is . Five days south an ' west , barrin ' floods or trouble . " Will pondered that a moment . They had ridden two weeks already into this strange country , and considered themselves lucky to have come so far unharmed . Five days deeper into the Cherokee lands would be risky indeed . He turned and glanced at Johnny . " It 's fr Bettie an ' Mary an ' them , " Johnny said . " I ca n't go back knowin ' I had n't done all I could . " " Nor me . " He turned back to their guide . " Will y ' take us there , Jack ? " The half-breed shrugged , a sickly smile on his face . " I take it that means fr a price , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief spoke again . Jack translated : " He says y ' oughter know that Snake Stick might not be inclined to do anythin ' for a white English . He thinks like a Shawnee , talks like a Shawnee . His heart ai n't ' xactly neutral . He goes up t ' visit  | the Shawnee an ' listens to ' em t ' git his blood all hot . Th ' chief warns us we oughter know that . " Will Ingles curved his forefinger over his upper lip and stared at the chief , thinking . Finally he said : " I reckon this ' ere Snake Stick 's like any other man . Like as not he 'd do f'r us  --  f'r a price . Thank our chief here . Tell ' im I have some gifts for ' im , in pay f'r his hospitality . Then we 'll be a-gettin ' on , to go see this Snake Stick . " Gander Jack thought it would be a good idea to give the Cherokee chief and his friends some whiskey in return for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Jack 's own thirst that had prompted the suggestion . And do n't you by God tell ' em we 've got any , either , " Will warned him . " This evenin 's goin ' smooth . No need to waste good liquor makin ' good Cherokees bad . Now hear me , Jack : I 'm a-sleepin ' with these jugs , and with my gun , and if I wake up hearin ' one squeak of a jug-stopper , I 'm shootin ' . D'ye get my drift ? " Nobody came into the hut that night to steal whiskey , but Will might as well have been standing sentry duty ; sleep just would not come , even though he was bone-weary and the pallet was far softer and drier than anything he had slept on for weeks . It might have been the sounds that kept him awake ; it might have been the smells . Now and then he would hear sounds of soft movement go past the hut , like moccasins on soft earth , like legging brushing against legging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the oblong patch of lesser dark that was the doorway of the hut and would put his thumb on the cold flintlock hammer of the rifle , which lay across his waist . He would stare at that blackgray oblong until it swam ; then he would look a little way above it , realizing that he could see it more clearly in the edge of his vision . A child coughing in its sleep somewhere in a nearby shelter made Will jump in his blankets and his heart pound for five minutes . The fact was , though Johnny Draper and Gander Jack had seen not a hint of it , that Will Ingles was scared halfway to death . It had been getting worse night by night during their long ride into the Cherokee country , but he 'd been able to put it down . Now , lying in the dark in the middle of a Cherokee town , he was almost shrieking scared . And the thought of going a week deeper into tribe country ,  | to parley with a nasty young Cherokee instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute he 'd be thinking how scared he was now , and the next he 'd be thinking how scared he was going to be next week . Damnation , it 's awful what a man 's got to go through to keep people believin ' he 's got guts , Will thought . Nobody had ever said Will Ingles did n't have guts . There had been too much evidence over the years that he did have . Anybody could say , and many did , " That Will Ingles , he 's got no fear of man nor devil . " Well , it was true Will Ingles had guts . But there were times , like now , when it seemed the main item in those guts was a white liver . I wonder if Johnny 's scared as I am , he thought . I wonder if he 's asleep or lyin ' there havin ' the gollywobbles like me . You can see it 1 when Gander Jack 's scared . You ca n't ever see such a thing on Johnny . Nor you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bet Johnny is , too . He heard a whisper of a sound outside and his hair stood up . His eyes bulged and he raised his head and spread his ears . It had sounded something like the noise when a man half-whistles . Like a sneak-signal . Like an Indian imitating an owl , maybe . Or maybe like an owl imitating an Indian , he thought , trying to smile it away . He kept his neck craned , listening , till it ached , until his ears were ringing so hard that he could n't have heard a hoot owl on his shoulder . Nothing happened . He let his head back down and stared at the invisible black ceiling , the gray of the smoke-hole in its peak , and he poured cold sweat and listened to his heart clomp around in his chest like a mule on a plank floor . It 's just from bein ' in an Indian town , he thought . A white man do n't belong in an Indian town . Nor does a white woman , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why he was here . in the middle of the night in the middle of an Indian town : because his Mary was somewhere else in the middle of the night in the middle of an Indian town . I mean , he thought , if she 's still alive , that 's likely where she is . He lay now , trying to pick up what she would be thinking . They  | had used to talk fanciful about being able to hear each other 's minds and see through each other 's eyes ; that 's how close they had been . He imagined tier thoughts as hard as he could , and came eventually to the conclusion that she was thinking about him . What if she 's doing this same thing and she hears how scared I am , he thought . I got to stop thinkin ' scared . It would n't do her good to know . That thought reminded him of something awful : It reminded him of the day of the massacre when he had seen her in captivity and had had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart about that , he thought . If she do , how could I ever look in her face again ? Pray God , she do n't know that , he thought . But he was afraid she did . When she started thinking about what he was thinking , she usually knew . She might think I 'm a poltroon , he thought . But by God , it ai n't what a man feels that counts , Mary , it 's what he does . And for you , Mary m'love , what I 'm goin ' to do is go on down and talk to this bad Cherokee Snake Stick . I mean . . . Tears suddenly were running into his ears . I mean , I love ' ee , Mary , more than I love my life . And here in the middle of this Indian town I got no more reason for scare than you do in that Indian town you 're in . I mean , you 're but a woman !  | THE big catfish lay on the silty creek bottom alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in crystal-clear water . It was the biggest catfish Mary had ever seen ; surely it was three feet long . Its gray-green back was so close to the color of the reekbed that she never would have seen it but for the slight motion of its whiskers and the slow undulation of fins and tail as it held itself in place against the current . Mary squatted on the bank above the fish . Moving as stealthily as possible , she braced herself on one knee and raised her sharpened hickory lance over her right shoulder . Ghetel was standing above and behind her , squirming with impatience and whispering what might have been prayers or advice . " Hush ! " Mary whispered . Her hand was trembling , both because of anxiety and because she was shaky from hunger . They had walked three days since their detour around the Buffalo River without finding so much as a blackberry to eat . Ghetel today had resorted to eating grass to keep something in her stomach , but Mary had heard men say that was not a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the hunger had become unbearable in the last two days , she had simply drunk water until her stomach could hold no more . Then she would feel the hunger not in her belly but in the fibers of her limbs . And in her mind . Now she held the tip of the lance , which she had whittled to a narrow , needle-sharp point with the tomahawk , about a foot above the surface of the water and aimed it at a spot just an inch below the  | catfish 's undulating fin . She thought quickly over the things she must and must not do when she struck : she must not hit an inch too high or too low , or the point would slip off the fish 's slippery side . She must strike hard enough that the point would penetrate the fish and not just knock it aside . And , as the point of the lance was not barbed to hold the fish , she must drive it all the way through the creature and pin him to the bottom and hold him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands into the water and get a grip on him . She had never realized until now that hunting was as much a thing of the mind as of the body . And when one was starving , it was hard for the mind to make the body wait until it was all figured out . She gathered the ready strength in her right arm until it felt like the cocked hammer of a gun . This was the first time in her experience that her life had depended on her killing a creature ; always Will or her father had done whatever hunting or slaughtering had been necessary . They , like the Indians , had thought it to be man 's work . Her heart pounded . Now ! Her arm snapped down . The spear shaft swished into the water . It seemed to bend upward under the surface and stuck into the creek bottom . Clouds of roiling silt marked the place where the fish had been . She groaned and the old woman wailed a curse in her language . Because of refraction in the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . The lance had jabbed through the water a good two inches above it . It was a lesson she must remember the next time she had a fish lying under her sight like this . If I ever do , she thought . It had been so perfect . Too perfect . Big fish do n't just lie down where you can reach them every day , she thought . The old woman was stamping along the creek bank , ranting bitterly , yelling that she would do it next time . She would not have missed it , she shouted . Mary stood up weakly , little starlike dots swimming behind her eyes . The dots went away . Water and mud dribbled off the end of her lance . She fixed a hard gaze on Ghetel . The old woman 's tantrum subsided like a pan of boiling milk lifted off the fire .  | " Y'do it next time , then , " Mary muttered . " Tai n't so easy as y 'd think . " On the eleventh day of their freedom they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get around another creek that had barred their progress up the bank of the O-y-o . That evening they found a clump of tall , wilting yellow flowers growing at the edge of a natural meadow . Mary had seen fields of these flowers near the Shawnee town and thus guessed that they were somehow edible . She and Ghetel tried eating the flower heads , then the leaves , but they were unbearably vile-tasting . Then Ghetel grabbed one of the stalks and pulled with all her strength . The flower came out of the ground and they saw that it had a fleshy , knobby root . Mary chopped off sections of this root with the tomahawk and found it to be white and crisp , almost as palatable as a raw potato . They pulled up all the stalks and obtained about a pound of the tubers . They ate them that evening and then lay down on a bed of leaves in the lee of a fallen log . With the awful gnawing gone out of their stomachs for the time being , they had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them awake . Those miseries soon were blanketed by their numbing exhaustion and they were asleep before midnight , under a huge sky full of chilly blue stars . On the twelfth day they had to go around another small tributary . Near this one , shortly before nightfall , they found a large fall of acorns under a chestnut oak . They had no fire nor kettle with which to boil the tannin out of the acorns , and so had to shell them and eat them bitter-raw . The first few tasted good even though bitter ; the rest they had to force themselves to chew and swallow . But again that night they slept with something in their stomachs and awoke with a bit of strength in their limbs to continue with the thirteenth ( lay of their escape . That day , as if thirteen were indeed unlucky , they found absolutely nothing to eat and went to bed groaning with hunger and aching limbs . Mary lay looking up at the stars and listening to the river , and through the rents in her dress she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under her skin klt like wooden furniture covered with cloth . There seemed to be no flesh . Her belly , which had been so swollen and turgid with child at  | the start of this ordeal  --  the massacre at Draper 's Meadows now seemed years past , though it had been only three months  --  now sagged concave between her pelvis and her rib cage , and her breasts were hard and dry . They had stopped making milk . She looked at the stars until her eyes burned , to keep from thinking about the baby . It was not terribly difficult , now that her body was forgetting . It was almost as if there had never been a baby , except when she would envision its eyes and mouth . Mary finally went to sleep lulled by the rhythm of Ghetel 's snores , and dreamed of Tommy and Georgie and her mother . They had been gone two weeks from the salt camp when , toward evening , Mary glanced over the O-y-o and saw a canoe moving northward across it . The canoe was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green water . Mary stopped and the old woman almost stumbled over her . Mary pointed at the faraway moving shape . They watched it head straight for the northern shore and then it disappeared . She recognized the spot then . It was the mouth of the Scioto . Her heart thudded . " Ghetel ! " She found herself whispering . " There ! There w 'd be the Shawnee town ! Up that river there ! " The old woman stared , eyes bulging , mouth hanging slack . " Gott , " she exclaimed , " yesss ! " " Ghetel ! That means . . . that means we 've come along a hundred and fifty miles ! Maybe more like two hundred , countin ' all them go-arounds ! " " So , eh ? " The old woman blew like a winded horse . " I 'm feelink like fife hunder . " They rested lying concealed in high grass overlooking the river and discussed the dangers of being this close to the Shawnee town . They had come up to a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ruddy-gold cross-light of the sunset they could see some of the fields and huts of the town on the far shore , and the haze of smoke from cooking fires . Now and then the bark of a dog or a wisp of human voice would carry to them across the wide river . They would have to move in concealment and as quietly as  | possible , Mary warned . She remembered the little Indian farm on this side of the river where she and her fellow captives had been held in wait for the canoes to come and ferry them across to the Shawnee town in August . Had it had dogs ? She tried to remember . She seemed to remember that there had been a large yellow dog sleeping in the shade of a canoe . If it was a regular ferrying place , of course , there would likely be danger of considerable Indian traffic : war parties , hunting parties . " We ought to lay here the night , " she said , " then head away from the river at sunup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazing wistfully at the smoke across the river . " Dey got food over there , " she said , clutching her belly and rocking . " I could eat a dog or two . Ach . Dog , yet . " Mary 's stomach too was an unrelieved silent scream of hunger . Then she remembered the cornfield at the little Indian homestead . It might not have been harvested yet . The more she thought of corn , the less she wanted to lie here till morning . Sleep would be impossible anyway . She began to grow desperately brave . " Come , " she whispered finally . The sun had descended behind the bluffs downriver and it was twilight when Mary and the old woman crawled through weeds along a pole fence , watching the Indian hut for signs of light or movement , meanwhile making their way toward the cornfield . So far they had not heard a voice nor smelled a wisp of smoke nor seen a spark of fireglow . But Mary remembered the young boys she had seen here and knew that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sliding silent as snakes through the weeds alongside the fence , she and the old woman suddenly froze . Very close ahead they had heard a heavy footfall  --  or , rather , felt it through the soft ground on which they lay  --  and heard a heavy huff of breath like a sigh . As they flattened themselves further in the weeds with slamming heartbeats , they heard two more footfalls , followed by a dull metallic clunk . A large dark shape then moved beyond the screen of weeds not three yards in front of them , causing the metallic sound again . Mary turned her face against the ground and looked up into a dark brown eye , which was looking down at her .  | A horse ! It was a roan horse with a bell on its neck . And at the moment she recognized what it was , the beast saw her in the weeds and shied . It half-reared , sidestepped , bell clanking loudly , then ran thumping and rustling into the scrub . Mary and Ghetel lay with their hearts pounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now expecting the horse 's flight to bring someone out of the hut , which was but a few feet away . For five minutes they waited in the deepening twilight . There was not a sound or movement from the house . In the distance the horse 's bell was still clunk-clunking . " I do wonder , does this place be deserted , " she whispered to Ghetel . " Wait now . " She arose as smoothly as her grinding leg joints would allow , and stood swaying for a moment . Her feet throbbed and stung as she put her weight on them again . She leaned on her hickory stick . When the dizziness was gone she looked over the fence , which was a sort of corral ; two of its poles were down nearby , explaining why the belled horse was wandering about . She could see the entire hut and much of its setting now , and grew more certain that it was deserted . Gathering more daring than she had suspected she had , she crept up to the very wall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went around slowly to the front , raised a hide door-flap , stooped and looked into the dark interior , smelling the musty , smoky closeness inside . She trembled , ready to thrust with the sharp lance if anything moved . Suddenly a twig snapped just behind her and a figure moved with a swish . Mary 's scalp flushed with prickles and , her heart in her mouth , she spun and thrust the hickory lance with all her strength at a hulking human figure that was suddenly there in silhouette against the evening 's hazy red afterglow . " AIIII ! " The point of her spear dug into soft resistance at the moment Mary recognized the cry and the shape as Ghetel 's and a shiver of horror cascaded down her flanks . " Jesus in Heaven ! " the old woman hissed , grabbing the shaft of the spear and yanking it out of the fabric of her dress . The point had missed Ghetel 's neck by an inch and ripped through the right side of her collar .  | Mary was in an uproar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two stood staring at each other for long seconds . " How dare y ' creep up on a body at a time like this ? " Mary finally hissed . " M'Gott ! I fought you would need me ! " The old woman 's voice too was quavering with indignation . They sagged toward each other then with shuddering sighs and hugged each other 's bones for support . The old woman patted Mary 's shoulder , and then the hazards of their situation dawned on them again . They had been loud with their gasps and exclamations . They stooped at the door of the hut peering about in the chilly dusk and listening . On the far shore of the river now , points of campfire light gleamed . A fingernail moon hung above a bluff in the east . Two owls were fluting to each other from different horizons . Mary wondered whether they were real owls . It was black inside the hut . The women had decided it was truly vacant . They felt around for things . They found only a broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and a bed of crushed boughs and leaves near the back wall . In the center of the hut was a circle of river stones around a pile of cold ashes . It was apparent that the Indian family had departed for some time , if not for good . They went out into the cornfield and found to their joy that the ears were nearly ripe but had not been harvested yet . Mary said grace under the slice of moon . " Thankee , Heavenly Lord , for this manna . " For a while then the only sounds were the rustling of cornstalks and the sounds of their gnawing and their little moans of pleasure . Mary soon felt a rising queasiness replacing her terrible emptiness . She swallowed a mouthful of the moist , starchy mass , then warned : " Must n't eat too much at once , Ghetel . Might be we 'll have a late supper too , eh ? " They went down to the river and drank water out of cupped hands , then back to the fence where they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their blankets draped over their shoulders , the night air chilling their ears and scalps , listening to the burbling and stitching of frantic digestion in their distended stomachs . Occasionally they rocked to and fro , for warmth and to help the food work down . After a while Mary realized it would be hours before she would be able to eat again , but the old woman was still thinking of food as she had been for days , and she could not bear to ignore the cornfield before bedtime . She went  | among the stalks and gnawed the kernels off of two more ears before she could admit to herself that she was satiated . " Da'st we sleep ' neath a roof ? " Mary ventured . She was growing drowsy over her full stomach . " I think there be frost a-comin ' on my head . " " 0 for a roof , yah . Why not , eh ? " They went in the hut and spread their blankets on the Indians ' old bed-square , and rolled up in them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had worked a bark shingle of the back wall loose to provide an escape-hole should anyone enter by the front door . It was fearsome to be sleeping in the home of savages who might or might not return , and the possibilities bothered her for an hour even as she grew cozy and less and less inclined to move . She decided to leave that chance in God 's hands , and prayed so . Ghetel was not snoring yet , either , and late in the night Mary heard her chuckle . " What ? " A sigh from the old woman . Then : " Vas I mad w'en you missed the fish ! But vaz I happy this night you do n't spear good ! " They laughed softly , and then they were able to sleep . Mary woke with a gasp , the tense grip of a strong hand on her arm . Ghetel was clutching her , sitting up in her blanket and staring toward the grainy silver predawn light in the doorway . Somewhere out there , dry leaves were rustling loudly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two women freed themselves from their warm blankets and snatched up their spears . In her waking panic , Mary recollected details of their situation ; she remembered the escape door she had made in the back wall . On hands and knees she turned and lifted down the slab of bark and looked out into the nearby cornfield . The noise was coming from there . She could see cornstalks jerking and moving . They dared not try to escape from this side . She watched , frozen , for Indians to emerge from the corn . The first face poked out among the leathery stalks . But it was at knee-height . Then there was another . Mary suddenly went almost silly with mirth . She reached back and grabbed Ghetel 's arm and pulled her down to the opening to show her the intruders . The faces were looking toward the hut . They had comical black  | masks over their eyes , and busy little black noses . Then one of the raccoons rose on its hind legs , reached up with little hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then started eating the tender kernels from the middle of the ear . " Eh ! " Ghetel cried . " It 's our corn ! GET ! " She scrambled to her feet and ran toward the front door with her hickory lance , abandoning all caution . By the time she had plunged into the corn patch , flailing with her stick , the furry little bandits had vanished and Mary was almost helpless with laughter . It seemed the misery of ages dissolved and sloughed off with this release . She was wiping her eyes when Ghetel returned stooping , grumbling , through the door . " Ah , Ghetel ! You and your raccoons ! " In the pink light of dawn they picked as much corn as they could tie up in the blankets , breakfasting on plump ears as they worked . They watched over their shoulders toward the woods and thickets , and kept an eye on the river for canoes . Their laughter might have been heard across the river in this morning stillness . Sounds from the Shawnee town were drifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thump of some tool ; the very distant gunshot of some hunter on the other side of the O-y-o . Mary was anxious to be well out of the vicinity of the town and this camp before broad daylight . They harvested rapidly the ears that the raccoons had not sampled . The little animals had done an amazing amount of sampling .. . " Hush ! " Mary whispered , listening . It was the clunking of the horse 's bell . Mary moved to the corral and saw the roan standing inside , looking at her . The animal appeared quite tame , evidently over its fright of the previous evening . Mary , her heart high with hope , quietly replaced the fallen rails of the corral and then went into the hut and returned with the hide strap . " How 'd y ' like us t ' have a horse ? " she said to Ghetel , who was knotting the corners of a blanket full of corn . " Yah ! For dinner , you say ? " " Nay , for ridin ' ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My feets say so . Ha ! " Having won the horse 's allegiance with a handful of corn and a few syllables of sweet talk , Mary easily got the leather strap tied to  | the thong that supported its bell . The horse was a mare , docile , long in the tooth , and so complacent and easily led that Mary presumed she was accustomed to white people . Probably stolen from whites , she thought . With quick and surprising ingenuity and some strips of leatherwood bark , Ghetel retied the blankets in such a way that they could be slung over the horse 's back with a bulging load of corn hanging at either flank , and by sunup they were ready to continue upriver . They were more cheerful than they had ever seen each other . They were strengthened by a supper and a breakfast of corn . They had enough food to last for several days , and a horse to carry it and themselves . They had already proven themselves by their first hundred and fifty miles , and with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four hundred miles loomed comparatively easy . " You ride first , Mary , " the old woman offered magnanimously . " I lead . " Mary suspected Ghetel was afraid to go first on an untried horse , but of course did not venture that appraisal . " No , " she said . " Till we 're out o ' this vicinity , let 's us stay low . We 'll both walk . " " Ah , yah . " They tried to keep themselves far enough inland that they could not be seen from across the river , but soon found that the cane and undergrowth were impenetrable everywhere but on the Indian trail along the , river bank . So all they could do was stay along the trail most of the time and hope they would not meet any parties of Indians coming down . It was a pleasant morning . Though they were in rags now , the walking and the food in them kept them warm , and the sun was pleasant on their faces when they were out of the shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this gift of Providence , and the little bell on its neck clanked , a sound musical and civilized to their ears after the rushings and roars and deep silences of the wilderness they had heard for so long , after the gunfire and tortured screams and sobbings of grief that had begun their wanderings in this savage purgatory . The bell was a dull bronze , old , and Mary wondered where it had come from . Civilized hands had made it , she was sure ; bells were civilized things . Maybe it was part of the booty  | brought here by raiding Indians . The kind of thing LaPlante and Goulart traded for skins . Aye , it very well might have been through that very trading post sometime , she thought . The blue and white checked pattern of shirt cloth moved in her mind behind her eyes . It seemed ages since she had been engaged in that business . Even that , in a way , seemed like civilization compared with the elemental subsistence of these last weeks . But she smiled to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those Frenchmen any more . She was free . With corn to eat and a companion who , though erratic and difficult , was a companion nonetheless , and with a good horse with a civilized bell . But that bell , she thought suddenly . P'raps for safety it ought to be thrown away . She stopped the horse and reached to untie it . " Vat you do here , eh ? " " Get rid o ' this . Kind o ' noisy f'r sneakin ' by Indians . . . " The old woman grabbed her hands and jerked them down . Mary looked at her in astonishment . " No , " Ghetel said , shaking her head severely . " This bell is good luck . Haf to keep . I had dream , the bell is good luck for us . " " Nonsense . It could be the death of us . . " She reached again ; again Ghetel shoved her hands away , with real roughness . Then the old woman 's face softened and brightened . She held a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . She stooped and gathered a handful of leaves and stuffed them inside the bell , around the clapper . Then , she tore off one of the rag tatters that had once been her dress , and bound up the bell to keep the leaves from falling out . " There , " she said . " So ve keep the bell . Is luck . " Mary shrugged . The little conflict of the moment was gone . And , in truth , she would have hated to throw the civilized little bell away into the wilderness anyway . Ghetel had done well , with her fond little superstition . The horse was proving a great comfort to them . Late in the morning , Mary climbed onto a ledge of limestone and slipped a leg over the animal 's broad back , tentatively , in case the mare was not accustomed to a rider . Gone are the days , she thought , when I could just spring on . The horse turned her ears and quivered her mane and tried to look back , but Ghetel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of her weight onto the horse 's back in the space in front of the bundles of corn . The mare blew softly but stood steady . " Eh , now . Lead on , Ghetel , I think she 's no objection whatever . " Mary was lulled by the motion of the horse 's progress , and realized how weary she was . Her legs tingled and throbbed in waves . Having no underclothing , and scarcely any outer garments , she was directly against the horse 's hide , could feel the friction against the insides of her thighs like a massage soothing away the stress , could feel the animal 's flesh giving slightly over its ribs , could smell the wonderful remembered musk of horse . She went into fits of dozing , or rather trances of oblivion , as she did not close her eyes ; and faces and scenes from Draper 's Meadows  --  the faces of her mother and the boys , Will sitting before the hearth luxuriating while she washed and kneaded his feet after a strenuous day ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at his sleeping profile after love while the pleasure of it in her loins ebbed into the deepest sort of ease  --  such dreams of their old hard but heavenly life drifted like smoke behind her eyes . Will had often said that the kindest thing people could do for each other was tend to each other 's feet at day 's end , and he had " done " her feet almost as often as she had done his ; she could feel now Will 's strong , warm hands kneading her arches almost to the limit of bearability , sometimes making her legs twitch , and his loving fingers flexing her toes , pulling them until their joints popped softly but surprisingly , and then rotating her tense , resisting feet on their ankles until her calves would relax  --  oh what a sweet good man was her Will ! Capable of the biggest and boldest efforts but kindly and attentive to the smallest need , always having time to give to anyone who needed him , however tired he was or how full of tomorrow his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ' y , William Ingles ; oh I vow I 'll reach ' ee . . . Suddenly a bolt of dread snapped her out of this reverie . In her mind she had seen a looming of dark faces . She opened her eyes onto the bright innocent yellow and crimson of autumn foliage , seeing nothing ahead but the horse 's neck and ears and Ghetel 's wild iron-gray hair and the gauntlet-stripe scars on the sagging skin of her back . But the feeling would not leave ; it was the feeling which on that July Sunday morning had made her glance repeatedly at the  | cabin door . She could not ignore it . " Ghetel. ! I 'm a-gettin ' off , " she hissed . The old woman 's face turned to her , reflecting the alarm she had detected in Mary 's voice . She halted the mare and Mary slid off to the ground . The pain of the sudden weight on her half-rested feet and legs almost made her fall . " Listen , " she whispered , " something 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . " At that moment the mare 's ears pricked up and she gave a low nicker , her head turned toward the shadows under a lofty wood . From somewhere in those shadows came the muffled sound of a man 's voice . They listened . A moment later it came again , louder . Mary jabbed with a finger toward a thicket of sycamores and locusts lying down the slope at their left , close to the river bank , and both the women hauled at the neck-halter to bring the animal along . They made a din of rustling and crackling on the leaf-andtwig carpeted floor of the thicket , and had just halted the mare behind a head-high clump of scrub when Mary saw the Indians , a mere fifty feet away . They were afoot , all warriors or hunters , going westward along the trail , toward the Shawnee town . They wore no war paint but carried their muskets at their sides . Several of the braves , in pairs , carried poles across their shoulders and there were dead animals and fowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary counted thirteen men passing , then a brindled pack horse with the whole carcasses of two small deer over its back , then another horse , a large bay , carrying a black bear strapped across it , the bear 's hanging head swaying and bobbing with the horse 's movements . Ghetel watched them and kept crouching lower and lower , as if wishing the earth would swallow and hide her big pink and gray body . Mary watched under the mare 's neck , stroking to keep her from starting or neighing . The hunters took a long time in passing . They were casual and jovial , talking and sometimes grunting out short , coughlike bursts of laughter . The two women remained still for a long time after the sounds of the hunters ' passage had faded . They stood letting their heartbeats and breathing return to normal , watching the trail for any sign that the group might have been only part of a larger body . At last a horsy  | smile spread over Ghetel 's face and she looked at Mary with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , beginning to shake her head , " but I listen to you after now . " " Tell y ' what I fear , " Mary said . " That afore this day 's done , them hunters will look down an ' see our tracks a-comin ' thisaway , an ' send somebody back here t ' see who we be . That 's what I fear as much as meetin ' more savages headlong . " Ghetel considered this , nodding and running her tongue thoughtfully over her back gums with elaborate ruminating movements of her lower jaw . Finally she announced : " Ven I vatch to th ' back , you vatch to th ' front . My turn to ride now , eh ? " " Aye . " " Get me a place to climb up , den . " And when Mary led the mare alongside a fallen log Ghetel could use as a mounting block , the old woman hoisted her broad bony rump onto the horse 's back as if she were getting onto a sidesaddle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised her left leg , instead of her right , and lowered it over the other side so that she was astraddle but backward , looking over the horse 's rump . She turned and looked down at Mary . " Now ve go , " she said , " and I see ' em if they follow . " Mary stared at her for a moment , mouth hanging open , then shook her head . " So be it ! " she laughed . " Hang on ! " And so they continued , up an Indian trail through the blazing fall foliage in the valley of the beautiful river , keeping a vigil fore and aft .  | THEIR great fortune in obtaining the horse seemed also to have extended to the weather . For three days they were blessed with mild , dry , southerly winds , sun-gilded , fleecy clouds cruising across a pearly blue sky . The wind soughed high in the trees above them , sent shivers across the surface of the river and stripped off the first loose leaves of autumn . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; leaves would spill off and whirl away like yellow snowstorms . Deep drifts of ochre and orange and crimson leaves deepened on the forest floor , fragrant and crisp and easy underfoot . Docile wasps and weary flies stitched leisurely through slanting sunbeams . Mary and Ghetel went on through this dry , balmy weather , taking turns riding and leading the mare , wading and limping through the rustling leaves , carrying their homemade lances upraised , like a pair of tatterdemalion remnants of some Amazonian cavalry . Mary sang her little homing ballad often as they went along . Ghetel had abandoned her retrospective mode of riding the first time the mare lunged roughly up a bluff and there was no mane to hang onto . The nights were dry and cool but not cold . Their supply of corn dwindled slowly , more slowly certainly than if they had dared try to kindle a fire to cook it in any manner . Drying on the cob day by day , it made a gritty and starchy meal , almost like eating chalk , so they did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more palatable . The few handfuls of berries , walnuts , wild grapes and persimmons they found each day were a wonderful relief . Because of her lack of molars , Ghetel had to find some way to crack  | and pulverize her corn , and usually smashed it with the blunt side of the tomahawk on a rock until she had a small dirty pile of yellowwhite grit that she could wash down with water . She ingested a fair amount of dirt and stone dust due to this primitive milling process . Mary 's own teeth were beginning to ache and loosen because of their wretched diet , and she would have strange twinges and itches in her gums , and could suck a taste of rot from between her grindingteeth . But at least the corn had bound up their flux , and both privately took satisfaction in the little hard stools they left behind every morning . Mary estimated that they were covering twice as much distance each day as they had before acquiring the wonderful animal , partly because the horse could carry them both across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wade on foot . The mare was a good forder. , not skittish at entering water , and would with good footing make her way across a strong current as high as her withers , with the two women astride her , the water reaching their hips , Mary clutching the mane , Ghetel embracing Mary 's scrawny waist . And when the mare would clamber out on the far bank , both the women would fuss over her , hug her neck , kiss her muzzle , stroke her throatlatch , hand-feed her a little corn and perhaps let her rest and graze if they were in grassy country . Mary had always loved horses , but never had she loved one with the same choking , tear-starting love she felt for this benevolent lovely beast that had appeared in her life when she had so desperately needed it . Sometimes she would look into the deep brown , soft-lashed eyes and would feel a rush of appreciation that felt almost like a prayer . " Ah , God , " she exclaimed once , " would that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communion could devastate her soul , because into that same rich upwelling of emotion the images of her three lost children would rush , as if through a gate suddenly left unguarded . On their third day with the horse , they came to a sandy-bottomed tributary that Mary distinctly remembered from the trip down in the captivity of Captain Wildcat . The Indians had crossed it in a canoe and had secreted the vessel in a canebrake on this shore . " Wait , " she said , and leaving Ghetel with the horse , pushed her  | way into the tall , waving yellow-green stalks , holding her hickory lance in front of her , both to part the reeds and to be ready in case she should come upon a water moccasin  --  or an Indian . She waded through the muck searching for the outline of a canoe . A loud splash a few feet in front of her made her recoil and break out in a cold sweat , and she stood with thudding heart until she decided that she had only startled a sunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud and shimmering vertical lines , her shoes filling with cold water , but found no sign of a canoe . Eh , well , she thought . Likely some outbound party 's left it on t' other shore . As she started to turn back , her eye caught a glistening dark lump in the shallows almost at her feet ; it was pulsating . It was a huge bullfrog , half-submerged , gathering itself to leap away . With a quick , desperate stab of her spear she impaled it . She turned her face from its sudden awful thrashing and squirming and waited until it was still . " May-ry ? May-ry ? " the old woman had begun querying , when Mary emerged from the brake proudly holding up her stick with the limp frog on the end of it . " Look , Ghetel . Look . Our first meat . " They twisted its big legs off and slid the slimy skin off as if pulling off stockings , and hunkered there on the river bank like a pair of aborigines , gnawing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own bone-picking and saw a string of slobber running from Ghetel 's underlip as she threw away her frogleg bones and started examining the rest of the frog . When Ghetel reached for it and began pulling off its tiny little arms , Mary had to look away . Something about the look of Ghetel 's hunger had sent a cold bolt of unnameable horror through her . They went five miles up the west bank of that river , stumbling through ravines and forcing their way through thickets and brambles that cut and lashed their skin and further shredded their rags , before finding a shallows of sand and gravel bottom where they could ride the mare across . Then they returned down the east bank . Here they had to lead the horse and walk through a vast tangle of  | grapevines and thorny locusts . There were a few leathery , hard , wrinkled grapes within reach , but obviously their season was past and they were no pleasure to eat . Nonetheless , the women gathered a few bunches and slipped them into the blanket bundles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come a time when even these would taste good . They were smeared with their own blood when they struggled at last out of the thorn ticket . They rinsed their limbs with river water , dug little black thorn-ends out of their wounds and continued downstream toward the O-y-o . Almost immediately they came to a creek mouth no more than knee-deep but strewn for yards with mossy , flat , sharp-edged rocks the size of dinner plates and tabletops , which tilted and slid and turned under their feet . By the time they had teetered and crashed across these to the other side , their rotten shoes had finished falling apart , and they were forced to abandon them and continue down the shore on bare , bloody feet that felt as if every bone in them had been fractured . They minced and winced at the stabs of twigs and stones in their soles , until their tender feet were at last so full of throbbing pains that new jabs could scarcely be felt . They took turns riding , but it seemed their feet hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they were being walked on . And , even more alarming , the mare herself was limping since the passage over the rocks . Mary examined her and found oozing abrasions , one on the pastern of her left foreleg and one under her right hind fetlock  --  very critical places , Mary knew , which could render her lame and useless if they were unlucky . So the women both dismounted and walked . They stopped for the day at midafternoon when the O-y-o came in view . Here they retied the neck halter into a hobble and set the mare to grazing . Mary limped about for a while looking for comfrey to make dressings for their feet and the mare 's legs , but found none and JI presumed that the season for finding it was now past . With little certainty , then , she decided to dredge up some muck from the river 's edge and put it on the mare 's wounds , feeling that this would at least soothe them . While stooping there she saw a long dark shape lying among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  which closer examination revealed to be a ruined Indian canoe , half-sunk in  | the shallows , with slabs of its bark cover fallen away from its hickory frame . This only reminded her that their entire route followed wellused Indian trails , and that there could be no carelessness or exces sive noise . And though she yearned for the comfort of a campfire , for yl hot water to heal their feet , and she probably could have started one even without flint and steel  --  she had watched squaws at the Shawnee town ignite tinder with an easily made bow-and-drill device  --  it would be foolhardy in the extreme to do it . She packed the cool black muck on the horse 's fetlock and pastern while Ghetel sat nearby , watching with an approving look while mashing corn and wild grapes together on a flat rock with the tomahawk . They added a handful of water to the meal later and made it into a purple paste that , while strange and awful to the palate , was certain to be nourishing , and did extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose to move about their camp , flashes of pain shot up from their battered feet . Mary remembered then the thoughts she had had so recently about Will , about their very personal attention to each other 's feet . She looked at the poor hag beside her , at her wrinkled , scratched skin hanging like wattles off her arms , and suddenly was drawn out of herself by a great tug of pity . " Come , Ghetel , " she said . And then for an hour as the late afternoon sun warmed their faces , they sat at the river 's edge , and Mary kneaded and palpated the old woman 's misshapen feet , those bundles of bones and calluses and knobby joints , with the rich mud , while Ghetel groaned deep with pain and delight . Mary talked of Will as she tended the old woman 's feet , and now and then tears would run off the end of her nose . Ghetel worked on Mary 's feet then , and talked to her about old Holland , whence she had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " and about great kitchens she had known , with copper pots and ladles and sausages hanging from the rafters , and cheeses maturing in cloth , and butter in the churns , and big porcelain ovens fragrant with new bread , until Mary was driven to ex-claim : " Have mercy ! Y 're caressin ' me at one end an ' torturin ' me at t ' other ! " *  | Their feet gave them agony the next morning when they first put their weight on them , but as they limbered with the walking , the pain lessened to a healthy ache and it became apparent that they really were much better . Neither of them rode the horse that morning , but walked and led her and studied her gait . She did not limp , and did not start limping as the day wore on , so they presumed that the mud had done as much good for her as for them . " We like as not can ride ' er tomorrow , " Mary said . They went eastward all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a fall of acorns to supplement their dwindling corn . At midday their course began to veer southeasterly , and Mary went back over her mental library of landscapes . As she recollected , there were still three major river mouths to be crossed before they would reach the great northeasterly curve in the O-y-o 's rivercourse and find the place , that pleasant point , where the waters of the New River flowed into the O-y-o . P'raps seventy or eighty miles to that place , she thought . But it could add up to two hundred if them three rivers ' twixt here and there detour us much . Their good weather gave out at midday . A sudden chill blasted over the river valley , sending millions of leaves spinning away in red and yellow whirlwinds , buffeting the treetops with an intimidating rush and moan . Iron-gray clouds came scudding over low , dragging their dirty-looking skirts over the hilltops , and in five minutes the river was flint-colored and seething with whitecaps . Chilly gusts blew the women 's hair over their faces and flattened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was full of spinning leaves and twigs . Their rags flapped and fluttered around them and they inched along squinting , staying close in the lee of the mare . And soon their skin  --  most of it exposed now by the disintegration of the clothes ? was being pelted by cold , driven raindrops that stung like sleet . The wind increased , so cold and powerful it seemed to suck out their breath . An enormous dead beech tree gave up its foothold on the slope a few yards above them and crashed to the ground , splitting and splintering smaller trees as it bore them to earth . The mare shied , reared and bolted . Mary hung onto its neck bridle through ten awful seconds , her feet hardly touching the ground , until she  | dragged the beast to a nervous , snorting standstill fifty yards father on . Ghetel , emitting little yelps into the wind , came running to catch up , with that strange , arm-pumping trot that had carried her through the gauntlet . Steeling themselves against the wet cold and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , both hanging on to the mare as if they might otherwise be blown aside into the river . Mary , though she had lived close to the edge of the wilderness most of her adult life , had never felt quite this way : like a weightless little speck of chaff lost in a universe of tumultuous elements , shrieking trees and indifferent mountains . But finally , about sunset time , when the wet leaves were cold and limp underfoot and the wet tatters of clothing stuck to the pasty gooseflesh of their skin , a dull rose glow began to burnish the bluffs across the seething river . Great horizontal rents opened in the purple clouds above the western horizon and glowed scarlet like bloody wounds . Soon a slice of setting sun looked through these rents and glinted in every droplet on every twig and every blade of grass . And finally the sun 's entire orb was freed from behind its bars of cloud ; and the storm receding across the river made a vast , bruise-colored backdrop for a perfect rainbow that seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt she was seeing the work of a God whom she had not thought much of for many weeks . She and Ghetel rolled up together in a wet cocoon of wool blankets that night , hugging , skin to skin , and shivered until the feeble furnaces of their hearts warmed their blood . While they slept , bold chipmunks and squirrels crept close and nibbled at the little pile of musty corn they had emptied out of their blankets . Mary rode first the next morning . Ghetel , walking barefooted on sparkling frost , led the horse . The ground was blanketed with wet leaves of every hue from livid crimson to flame-yellow , all their colors intensified by the wet and frost and wan morning sunlight . Ghetel was singing something to herself in Dutch , just above a whisper , her breath and the mare 's breath condensing . Mary had her blanket over her shoulders , Indian-style ; there was little enough corn to tote in one blanket now . They had agreed that the one riding  | would enjoy the blanket , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghetel was warm she did not show it . Her skin was raised in bumps like a plucked turkey 's , and every few seconds a great tremor would shake her from one , end to the other . God , but she is a rugged old thing , Mary thought . But I 'd best trade places with her and give her the blanket right quick or she 's like t ' come down with a grippe ere this day is out . She hugged herself inside the blanket . In just a minute , she thought . Gusty weather came again the next day . Dark clouds sped over the hilltops trailing veils of rain . The wind was so strong that a cloud would pass from horizon to horizon in a minute 's time . Shrubbery shook and rattled as if being slapped to and fro by an invisible giant hand . The air was always full of flying yellow leaves ; what little remained of the foliage clung and clung against the wind but invariably was picked off and swirled away , and the trees were almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their stark , desolate nakedness had a chilling effect on the spirit . Mary pondered on this as she walked along . I do believe the sight o ' them autumn leaves , like the colors o ' flame , kept my poor soul warm just like watchin ' a fire will do f'r a body . . And she found herself thinking as she rode , looking down at Ghetel , who was at that moment walking and leading the mare : If only these blankets was red , a nice hot red instead o ' this cold gray , we 'd be a sight warmer . . . And then she smiled at her fancy . Y 're goin ' a bit daft there , girl . Best y ' get down an ' let of Ghetel sit up here a-rockin ' and a-daydreamin ' a spell . . . That day they came to another river mouth too wide and deep ? and cold  --  to wade across . Ghetel gazed at the far shore and groaned . These detours seemed to frustrate her even more than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know the lay of the land , and every new stream was just another unexpected obstacle , as if God were spitefully throwing down new rivers in their path every day to make their way longer . So they turned and started up this latest river .  | In skirting a marsh in this river 's valley , they found a stand of browning arrowleaf stalks . They tied the horse nearby and spent an hour wading in the cold ooze , feeling with their toes for the tubers , stooping to pull them up when they found some . They gathered five or six pounds of them , put them in the bundle with the musty corn and continued upstream . This river was wide and was running fast with brown water from the recent rains . It appeared they would have a long trek up its banks before finding a place to cross . And all the while they were aware , in the back of their minds , of the O-y-o River , their guide through the wilderness , dropping farther and farther behind them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that evening , encamped under an overhanging ledge with the flooding river roaring noisily a few feet below . The raw tubers had an awful , woody , bitter taste . " If'n we had a pot t ' bile ' em in , " Mary grimaced , " I swear right now I 'd risk buildin ' a fire to do it . " But they were filling . They had traveled perhaps twenty-five miles up this nameless river , when , the next day , Ghetel pointed down and cried , " Look ! a britch ! " At a place where the river thundered down over a kind of rock step , a mass of driftwood had become lodged . It extended all the way across the river , a tangle of bleached logs and limbs and roots , and indeed was like a bridge . The brown water rushed through and under it , but it stayed , a great knot of debris . " We can cross here , neh ? " Ghetel urged with a happy , yellowtoothed grin . But Mary looked at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wait now , " she said . " I 'm getting a bad feeling about this . It do n't look none too sure t ' me , somehow . " Ghetel turned a darkening face on her , then pointed upstream . " Eh , how far you vant to go up dis riffer , eh ? Look ! " Above the driftwood bridge the river was still deep and swift . They might have to go another twenty-five miles before finding a fording place , maybe farther . And that would mean fifty or more back down the other bank to regain the O-y-o . That was an awful prospect .  | And here was this bridge , as if put here by Providence to save them three or four days ' travel . But the bridge nonetheless gave her a premonition of dread . And she was learning to take her premonitions seriously . " Vatch me , " Ghetel was saying . She had gone down to the river 's edge . She reached out , grasped a protruding limb for a handhold , put one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she lifted the other foot off the shore . She stood a moment on the end of the bridge , then began flexing her knees , rocking her weight on the lodgment , testing its solidity . Then she bounced more violently , crying , " Vatch ! Vatch ! It stays ! " Do n't , Mary thought . It seemed too reckless a taunting of Fate . But it held . Ghetel backed onto the shore , grinning . " Easy , " she said . " See ? " " Aye , for us , p'raps . But a horse canno ' walk logs , Ghetel . " " I t'ink she can do . It is like a britch , May-ry . Like a britch . " " I have this feeling .. . " " Go to the deffil wit ' a feelink ! " Ghetel 's face was growing stormy with impatience . " If you don ' come over here , I do it alone ! Yah , ve 'll see ! Who need you and your feelink ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn ! Or I go alone ! " " Then let 's test it all the way across first. , " " Yah ! I do . " The old woman , bent upon showing what a lark it would be , swung lightly up onto the driftwood again . She walked the logs lightly , and found a handhold every yard or so . In two minutes she stood on the opposite shore , holding her arms up gaily and grinning . Then she hopped onto the driftwood again and came back . " You see ? " " But the horse . . . " " It is like a britch . " And so Mary gave in . She and Ghetel combined their strength to pull the horse down to the water 's edge . It did not want to go . It dug its hooves in on the bank and refused to step onto the logs . Mary looked into its panicky brown eyes and her heart squeezed . " Move , beast , " Ghetel panted . It would not .  | " Eh , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You pull , May-ry . I put a stick up dis animal 's hinder and she vill go , ve see . " She got one of the hickory lances and went around behind the mare . Gently at first , then harder as the horse continued to balk , she jabbed at its rump with the point . The abject terror and pain in the mare 's eyes made Mary want to cry . But she talked to it and cajoled and encouraged and pulled at the neck-halter with one hand while hanging onto a limb with another . At last the mare yielded and took a step forward . She got a good footing on the log jam with her forehooves and , finding something under her , resisted a little less . But she was still very skittish . The water roaring underfoot was frightening her and Mary did not blame her . Ghetel roared a curse or command in Dutch and jabbed the hickory point straight into the animal 's anus . With a terrible whinny , the mare gave up the shore and scrambled so suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river . Now Mary inched backward along the logs , reaching back for handholds , pulling at the halter , trying to ignore the rush of the water below , the swaying and trembling of the driftwood jam under the horse 's weight . The animal was surprisingly sure-footed , and was coming along now . Whenever she stopped or threatened to panic , Ghetel would prod her on with the now bloody lance , and she would lunge forward a step . These quick moves were dangerous , but obviously the mare was not going to progress without them . They were midway across the jam now , with a mere fifteen feet to go . Suddenly , both the mare 's forefeet broke through the matted driftwood and into the water . She began neighing pitifully and throwing her head about . Her rump was high ; her chest rested on the logs . She strained with her rear haunches , trying to lift her forelegs up and out . This futile thrashing lasted only seconds . A hind hoof slipped sideways off a log and poked through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other side of the log . A broken limb had penetrated her right side just behind the ribs ; it was impossible to tell how far . The mare was screaming , her  | chest resting on the drift with her legs in the water . The water under the horse was running with red stain . Mary cried encouragements to her , unconscious commands and entreaties , beginning to sob , hauling upward on the halter as if she could extricate the shrieking mare 's legs by sheer force of lifting . Ghetel stood on the logs behind the horse , her ugly face working with disbelief and anguish . She began shouting in Dutch . She dropped her lance and grabbed the horse 's tail and pulled up on it with all her might . The log jam trembled with their exertions and the steady pressure of the river 's flow . Limbs and logs shifted and groaned . " It 's going to break ! " Mary cried . The horse kept throwing its head about and screaming its piteous scream , and trying with futile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wound in her side was torn wider and deeper . And now the old woman was climbing past the horse , motioning frantically at Mary as she came toward her . " Get off ! Get off ! " Mary turned away from the beloved beast and scrambled on all fours to the shore . She stood shaking and crying as Ghetel jumped to the ground beside her . She could n't look at the suffering beast now . She clapped her hands over her ears to shut out its pitiful cries . She looked at the ground and cried helplessly at this latest great loss . Ghetel stood making helpless gestures with her hands and looking back and forth between Mary and the horse . Finally she said , " Wait , " and climbed back onto the logjam and crept toward the animal . The mare suddenly fell still , as if trusting this person to come help her . She kept repeating a low , wet nickering deep in her chest . Ghetel edged alongside her and lifted the blanket-bundle off the mare 's back . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head to untie the halter and bell-rope . She brought these things , all their belongings , ashore . She closed a big hand firmly over Mary 's upper arm and started to propel her downstream away from the dying animal . Suddenly it began shrieking and tossing its head again . " Oh , stop it , stop it ! " Mary sobbed . " I ca n't bear it any more ! " They were a hundred yards down the east bank now but the horse 's cries were still audible over the rush of the river . Mary felt as if she would hear them when she was a hundred miles away .  | About an hour 's walk downstream they stopped to rest . Mary felt ten times as weak as she had felt before . It was as if they had lost not only the horse 's own strength but also an equal amount of strength the horse , had given them just by being . They sat on a black , rotting log . Mary had stopped crying . She sat with her face in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visage to Ghetel . " You are a stupid old woman . " Ghetel winced and glanced down , but then raised her eyes to Mary 's and reached over to pat her on the shoulder , saying : " Eh , now . No . Ve could not do any help . " Mary pulled away from the extended hand . After a moment , she said : " You told me you were going to listen to me when I feel something . " Ghetel nodded . " Yah . " " But you would n't listen . " " Eh , now , May-ry . Forget dis . " Her voice was a little brusque now . She was sorry about the horse and she knew she was responsible and did not care to have the blame for that added to her present miseries . " You said right after I felt them Indians a-comin ' that you 'd listen to me from that time on . . . " Ghetel jumped up and stood before Mary with both fists raised over her head . " Eh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I t'ink I listen to you too much already ! If I did not listen to you I vould be in a varm Indian house ! With a fire and a full belly ! " " Aye , y ' would be , eh ? A belly full o ' squash an ' dog meat , that 's what full of ! " " A belly full , anyway ! My stomach du n't care whether the meat said ' roff , roff ' or ' m0000 ' when it was alive ! " " Do n't it now ? " Mary snapped bitterly . " But it was ' ee cornplainin ' about th ' Indian victuals , not I. ' T was ' ee blatherin ' about all y'r fine kitchens an ' y'r fine Dutchy dinners an ' all . . . " And while Mary was railing on this way , falling back , as she did when upset , into her mother 's brogue , while she was pouring out all this grief and anger over the loss of the horse , the old woman had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down beside her on the log again . And when Mary 's invective had run down and some of the hurt had eased out of her breast , she became aware that her head was leaning on the old woman 's shoulder , and Ghetel was gently stroking down her matted hair and saying , ' A gut girl now . A gut girl . And you 're all I haf in dis vorld , May-ry Inkles . All I haf. "  | THEY ran out of corn . They ate the last of it on the O-y-o River bank at a place where the river course came down from the north and went a long way west . Mary recognized the place , even though the foliage of summer was now gone and the evening sky was full of marching black clouds instead of sunset : It was the place ? where the Indians had stopped to gaze down the broad valley and she had caught Captain Wildcat staring at her in that strange and smug way as if she had been a good possession of his . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about nothing now but that they had eaten the last of their corn . They had detoured around two more rivers and two creeks since the one where they had lost the horse two days before . Now they sat looking down the great , slate-gray river and held their blankets over their heads and clenched tight at their throats to keep them from being blown off by the relentless wind . Finally , unsettled by Ghetel 's dark and lifeless stare , Mary ventured : " I know where we are . " She forced a smile . " We 're just about exactly halfway home , accordin ' to my reckonin ' . " Ghetel said nothing for a while . Then : " Eh . Half . " " Y 'd not 've thought we could come this far , would ' ee ? " " Nor go farder . " " Oh , yes . " She tried to be cheerful . She knew that Ghetel was now blaming her for their unspeakable circumstances , and she could see that the old woman was nurturing that resentment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twinge of hunger she  | felt , and that the resentment would surely only get worse from here on because food was getting to be almost impossible to find , . and within a day or two they would be leaving the relatively easy terrain of the O-y-o valley and turning up into the steep and boulder-strewn valley where the waters of the New River twisted through the towering mountains of the Allegheny range . " I reckon we 've walked all in all about three hundred fifty mile in less'n three weeks , " she went on . " Do n't that make ' ee feel some'at proud ? It does me , I 'll say as much ! " " Eh ! " " Come on , then . There 's still an hour o ' light . Then we 'll find us a nice cozy place out o ' this wind , an ' we 'll get all snug an ' I 'll do the kindness to y'r feet , eh ? What say'ee t ' that ? " She rose , hurting in every joint but making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under her blanket , in her knotted rope belt , hung the tomahawk . Its cold steel head against her naked flank made her shudder . But she did not want Ghetel to carry it . Since the loss of the horse , she had little faith in Ghetel . Ghetel would probably lose it , as she had lost her lance , and as she had lost them the horse . And they could not afford to lose the tomahawk . They simply would be out of all luck if they lost the tomahawk . She reached down . " Up , now , dear , " she said . Reluctantly , the surly old woman took the hand and groaned to her feet . Her gray face under the dark cowl of the blanket was full of hollows now , and in the gloom , with strands of wild , dirty white hair blowing over her face , she looked like a spectre , like a witch . The muffled bell hung on the strap around her neck . Nay , Mary thought . She 's but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it all . A marvel that she can still get up . I 'm a-goin ' back t ' Will . There 's strength fr me in that . But what 's she got t ' look to , other'n a fat hot Dutch supper someday ? " That 's m ' good darlin ' , it is , " Mary encouraged , turning her and starting to lead her up the river bank . " Oh , I d'know what I sh 'd do without ' ee ! " They had not found a bite of anything edible by the next evening and it was then that the old woman started talking about the horse . The sun had at last broken through the cold dark cloud-cover ,  | just in time to glow like a dying campfire between the river bluffs downstream . It reflected in Ghetel 's eyes as she looked back down the river . She suddenly started spewing a stream of Dutch invective so bitter and unexpected that Mary stopped where she was and came back to stand in front of the old woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a madwoman . " What is this ? " Mary demanded . " Dat horse . How vas I so stupid ? " " Nah , nah , Ghetel . It 's a past thing . I 'm sorry too , but we tried and it failed . Do n't blame y'self .. . " The old woman was clenching her fist against her chin and the fist was trembling . " No ! I mean the meat ! The meat . " " What ? What meat ? " " The horse ! The horse ! " Mary blinked and stepped back . " Oh , no . Don ' say " Ve should haf meat ! Dat horse dies . Ve should haf . . . " She made a sudden motion with her fist as if striking the poor beast between the eyes with a tomahawk . Then she turned to Mary with eyes ablaze . " Listen , " she hissed , and her mouth worked into a ghastly smile . " Gif me the ax , and I go back and get us meat . Meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old woman 's arm was tense and trembling . Mary licked her lower lip and tried to figure out how to talk to her . This was a new kind of thing to deal with . " Dear , " she said , in a soothing way as if trying to teach something to a child , " now , we 've come three days a-walkin ' since that sorry day . We 've come along good , an ' I wager we 've done fifty miles . Now , we 're no such fools , you an ' me , as t ' go back fifty miles f'r a poor nag . Th ' buzzards ' as got ' er by now , anyway , if not a panther . . . " " All dat meat ! Gif me the little ax ; I go back . .. " She snatched suddenly at Mary 's blanket , tried to claw it open and get the tomahawk . Her hands were strong and she pulled the blanket away and Mary was swept by the cold wind . She spun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghetel , stopping her . " And besides , " Mary continued , more firmly now , " we loved that horse . She was our friend , give to us by God when we needed ' er . That 's why we never thought t ' eat ' er . Never even thought o n't . . . " Ghetel 's face set in a strange , cunning resignation . Wherever her reason was , she could comprehend that at this moment , Mary was  | armed and she was not . But a shrewd little smile stayed on her face as she seemed to acquiesce . " Now if'n y ' see my way o ' thinkin ' , " Mary went on in a level voice , " kindly hand me back m ' blanket there , dear , as I 'm likin ' t ' freeze . .. " Ghetel gave her the blanket and Mary draped herself in it and smiled as if everything were nice and ordinary , but she stayed on her guard and kept the spear at hand . They found a bower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcropping , and Mary massaged the old woman 's feet for a long time . Then they rolled up in their separate blankets and about an hour later Mary went to sleep waiting for Ghetel to go to sleep . When Mary woke the next morning before dawn , the old woman was gone . She had taken her blanket and the tomahawk and Mary knew she had set out to go back fifty miles to butcher their old friend the horse . Mary knelt in her blanket for a few minutes , trying to figure out what to do . She was furious with the old woman , who had let the misery in herguts overpower the reason in her head and the nobility in her soul . For a moment Mary thought about simply forgetting the crazy hag and pressing on alone toward home . She still had her blanket and her spear . The loss of the tomahawk was a serious matter . But not having the old woman to feed and humor and contend with would give her much greater freedom and probably much less trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes threatening , and could not be depended on to act wisely . But for those very reasons , the old woman would surely get herself lost or killed or would go completely crazy running around in circles desperately seeking food . Mary imagined the old woman attacking a bear or something with the tomahawk to kill it for food and getting killed herself instead ; then she envisioned her getting lost and wandering alone in the forest screaming and mad . And then , having imagined this , there was nothing to do but get up and draw the blanket around herself-and , using her spear as a walking stick , go back down the river and try to find Ghetel while  | there was still a chance of finding her . It was terrible to go back even a step . But the main reason she had to go back was because it was unthinkable to proceed up into the dark mountains and roaring gorges and the cold , howling nights of the approaching winter without a companion . The sun was a white blot trying to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sky over the ridges , when Mary heard a strange moaning and mumbling nearby at her left . She had come perhaps three miles , and before her was the mouth of a creek they had circumvented the day before . Mary paused and held her spear aslant before her , and moved with stealth toward the sound . The leaves crushed loudly under her feet . At the edge of the creek bank she stopped and looked down . In her drab blanket , Ghetel was as colorless as the sere landscape and Mary would hardly have seen her but for the movement of her rocking . The old woman sat on an exposed sycamore root at the creek 's edge , rocking back and forth , groaning and talking to herself . The tomahawk lay on the ground a few feet away . Mary 's pity flooded out to the old wretch . Poor soul , she thought . Jus ' could n't face one o ' these creek walkarounds alone . Mary edged down the creek bank and picked up the tomahawk and put it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned her face to Mary . It was wet with tears and snot and her nose was red . She showed no surprise at the sight of Mary . It was impossible to imagine where her mind was . Mary extended her hand . " Come , dear . Y ' been goin ' the wrong way . " However much or little the old woman comprehended , she apparently had forgotten about or given up hope of finding the horse . More important , she seemed to understand that she must follow Mary . Without Mary , the wilderness was utterly pathless and there was no such thing as direction . Mary was like a compass needle , steadily pointing toward somewhere , and if the old woman had learned anything in her morning alone it was the utter emptiness of having no guide . It was perhaps a worse emptiness than that  | of hunger . And so Ghetel was compliant , and followed Mary , followed her and stayed close , as they continued northward along the winter-gray O-y-o and came at last to the place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary recognized it at once , despite the change the season had wrought . There was that wide river mouth coming down through the narrow but lush bottomland , between those steep and darkflanked mountains . There on the opposite side of the mouth was that spacious grove where they had camped , and where the medicine brave had made the hickory frame to carry the baby girl in . . . She put that thought of the baby out of her mind quickly and led Ghetel southeastward to the place where the Indians had hidden the canoes after coming across . It would be good if we could find a canoe , she thought . It was not that she wanted to cross the river here , particularly ; this side of the valley looked as easy to walk as the far side , and if they could stay on this bank for a while , they would have the river between themselves and the Indian road . But the river was broad and slow here , and going up it in a canoe would be a needed relief from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare feet to rest and heal . Also she knew that a canoe turned upside down on a river bank , with a deep bed of leaves under it , would make a good shelter against cold rains . November , according to her calendar of knots , was but a week or so ahead , and she knew what November could be like in the high and harsh Alleghenies . But here again she found no canoes . If there were any canoes at the mouth of this tributary , they were on the far shore and it was useless to think of them . She came back to the place where Ghetel squatted rocking on her haunches and gazing forlornly across the river mouth . " Eh , now , Ghetel . They 's no canoes here , so it 's time we get on our shanks an ' git . " The old woman shook her head slowly and extended a gnarled hand toward the river . " Vat use ? Ve nefer find a place to cross dis big ' un . " " Ah ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have t ' cross this'n . We go up this'n all th ' way t ' home ! " Ghetel looked up at her as if this were beyond comprehension , or  | was perhaps just a ruse to get her on her feet . " Home , " she said low and flat , as if dismissing the word . " Aye ! Home ! Trust me now , dear . I know the way . " I hope I know the way , she thought , remembering the tortuous route along creeks and over ridges and game trails and under cliffs by which the Indians had brought her down . And interspersed among the memorized landmarks in her mind there were those blank spaces : the hours , sometimes whole days , when she had been so absorbed in grief and the pain of coming childbirth that she had not been able to observe the route at all . But I know the way . Far enough up this river , regardless of the shortcuts th ' savages carried me over , I 'll come to places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fervently believing now that she was telling the truth , " I sure do know the way . Come along . 0 ten times te  --  en times ten a  --  way . . . " And it made her voice sound so good that old Ghetel actually smiled as she unfolded her creaking bones and stood up .  | JOHNNY DRAPER leaned close to Will Ingles and said in his ear : " This ' ere Snake Stick 's sour as gooseberry vinegar . Reckon whiskey 'd sweet ' im up a mite ? " Will looked at Snake Stick . The deep furrows in the Indian 's cheeks ran down beside and then under the downturned corners of his mouth , and there were two deep vertical creases between his brows . A man would have to frown for forty years straight to get such a grouchy set to his face as that , Will thought . " I don ' know , " he murmured to Johnny . " It could just as likely craze ' im an ' make ' im do what he 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other , " Snake Stick warned , his eyes looking even harder . " English talk straight to Snake Stick . " He thumped himself on his massive hard chest . Then he leaned forward , his face lighted from below by the little smokeless council fire . Twenty men of the village sat behind him , making a semicircle in the lodge , looking as if they were competing among themselves to appear as grim as Snake Stick , who now asked : " English say word whiskey ? " " Aye , " Will replied , thinking : Lordy , but they got a keen ear f r that word . " English give Snake Stick whiskey . " The chief seemed to be very intrigued that Will Ingles ' name sounded so much like " English , " and had been addressing him disdainfully as " English " since the white men 's arrival here this afternoon .  | Will nodded and delved into the duffel pouch he carried slung by a strap over his shoulder , and brought out a pewter flask covered in leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snake Stick . He could tell by the way the chief reached for it that he had quite a weakness for it ; the Indian was trying to look casual but his cold eyes were suddenly blazing . He put it to his mouth and sucked hard on it , thus taking a lot of whiskey in what appeared to be a short swig . He might have been fooling his red comrades , but Will Ingles had watched men drink enough to know that Snake Stick had probably diminished the contents by a good third . The chief put the flask down on the floor in front of him and wiped his mouth on the back of his hand . His eyes were watering . He said : " English have more whiskey on horse ? " " That I have . " " Snake Stick could take it from English and English could not do anything to stop him , " the chief said with an arrogant half-smile . " No , " said Will . " Snake Stick could not . " The chief 's eyes narrowed hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red man 's honor will not let him rob a guest . I admire this in the red man . " The chief 's eyes fell and then came back to Will 's . " But English would give Snake Stick much whiskey , for his braves to drink . " With two turns of his head he indicated those who sat around him . " Yes , I 'd do that . . . if Snake Stick would promise to try to help me in this matter with the Shawnee . If not , then no . I 'll give whiskey to a Cherokee who 'll be my friend . " The chief blew a breath so boozy that Will envisioned it bursting into flame over the council fire , then picked up the flask and took another powerful pull . Christ 's good name , Will thought , I better get this heathen 's word in five more minutes , or ' e wo n't be fit to give it . And he was not entirely sure he could hang anything on Snake Stick 's honor anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter man 's word of honor was not as good as that of an amiable man . " English will bring whiskey for my men , " Snake Stick announced . " Gander Jack , " Will said to the guide without looking at him ,  | " would y ' trot out an ' fetch me one o ' them demijohns ? " He felt the guide rise and leave behind him . He heard the shuffling of many moccasins as Jack left , and realized that the darkness in the lodge behind him had been filling with people . People coming in very stealthily . And he knew too that they would not be coming in unless Snake Stick was permitting it . He fought down a shudder . This Cherokee seemed a treacherous wretch indeed , and Will admitted the possibility that he and Johnny , and maybe even Gander Jack , might well be enjoying the final confabulation of their careers . Jack returned with the demijohn . He put it on the ground in front of Will and looked at him with raised eyebrows , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wish this dang Snake Stick did n't hear English , Will thought . I 'd sure like to confer with Jack here an ' see what ' e thinks . Will thumbed the wax off the jug 's neck and pulled the stopper . Snake Stick pointed to the jug and then to Will and Johnny and Jack . Will hoisted the demijohn with both hands and took a pull . Then Johnny took a long , gurgling drink , passed it to Jack and sighed , licking his lips . Jack then came forward and gave it to Snake Stick , who sampled it heartily and passed it to the brave on his right with some Cherokee talk that Will guessed to mean save some for me . The braves passed it around while Snake Stick 's black eyes flashed with volatile thoughts . The Cherokee 's eyelids drooped a little now , making his malevolent gaze look shifty . Will 's doubts about his trustworthiness increased . " English listen : Snake Stick is not happy you come here and ask this thing . " He swiped his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to his Shawnee brothers and speak for English . The Shawnee will say to Snake Stick , ' Why do you talk with English ? ' They will say , ' If you are so near English to talk , you should strike him . ' " " Then I reckon you would answer , Because the Cherokee are not at war with the English . ' " " They are not at this day , " Snake Stick grumbled . " Tomorrow yes . Snake Stick this day is at war with the English in his heart . " Will 's nostrils distended and he said : " I remind you that today I 'm a guest in your lodge , and that y 're a guest in my jug , big feller , an ' I think we 'd do well as each other 's guest not to talk hostile . "  | Will heard Gander Jack take a quick breath behind him , but he had borne about enough of Snake Stick 's insolence and it was hard to remain diplomatic . " If my whiskey makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll just cut Snake Stick off from my whiskey , eh ? " The Indian 's eyes flashed . But he was enough of a chief to understand the protocol of guests and hosts , and so contained himself . Gander Jack looked back and forth between them . He saw that Mr. Ingles had actually gotten away with that bold talk , and he looked at him with considerable respect . Still , the exchange had done anything but put him at ease . This was a formidable white man who could look and talk and act like one of those chiefs in the white man 's Bible , but he was in a place where one could be too formidable for his own good . Will Ingles said now : " Even if you 're at war with English men in your heart , I hope you 're not at war with English women and children . Your Shawnee brothers killed the mother of my woman , and they killed my brother 's baby son . They took away my woman and my sons . I do not care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but sure it 's no brave deed t ' murder and kidnap their women and children . Ask y'r Shawnee brothers if their Great Spirit would smile on them for this . Ask ' em if the Frenchmen are better people than the English if they hire red men to make war on those who can not fight . " Snake Stick had glowered at Will Ingles through this , and now he put his hands on his thighs and took a deep breath and made ready to debate . He was gathering answers from back in his head , where the whiskey was working . " The French men do not fear the Great Spirit . The French men have medicine men of their Great Father . Wear black squawclothes . They forgive the Shawnee for what he must do in war . " " What in blue thunder is he talkin ' about ? " Johnny asked . " Priests , " Will said . " I heard Colonel Washington tell Jim Patton about ' em . The French make odd use of ' em ... " " English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was just a-sayin ' the French make ill use of their Great Spirit , " Will said to Snake Stick . " You 'd do better to stay with your own . " The chief thought on this and chose not to argue it . He picked up the jug and took another deep swig.  | " You drink my whiskey , " Will said , " so I reckon you 're willin ' to talk business with me . " " English talk . " " Good , then . When you go up to your Shawnee brethren , if y ' please , ask after a woman named Mary Ingles  --  Mary Ingles  --  and her two little sons . And a woman named Bettie Draper . Bettie Draper . They were taken from a settlement near the upper Jack , what is it they call the New River ? " " Chi-no-da-ce-pe . " " Chi-no-da-ce-pe , " said Will . " Far up by Blue Ridge . " " Mer English , " the chief said . " Mer English with two sons . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you remember those ? And there was a man took with ' em : Henry Lenard . I would buy him back too . " Snake Stick shook his head . " Not buy English man back . Shawnee at war with English men . " " Ask anyway . Henry Lenard was not a soldier . He was a hunter . " " A hunter can be a soldier . Not sell back . " " Let the Shawnee decide who they 'll sell back . I 'm only askin ' you to carry my offer , " Will said , trying to mask his impatience . " How much is English offer ? " " I 'll show you . " Will leaned forward on his crossed legs and stood up . " Jack , m'lad , help me bring in the packs . " They went out through the crowd of Indians , who parted to let them reach the door . The sky was starry and the air was crisp outside the lodge where the horses were tied . " How 're we doin ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared at first that he 'd thought he 'd mess himself , but getting mad at that goddamned mean Indian had braved him up . He was almost having fun . " If he do n't kill us , we 're doin ' better than I 'd ' a ' thought , " Jack muttered . They unstrapped the packs and carried them into the lodge , and spread their goods out where Snake Stick could see them all . His warriors and chieftains crowded close around and admired the treasures . Their eyes were covetous but their faces remained closed . Will tried to look at the stuff from their point of view . He had invested everything he had in this junk . After a while the chief raised his eyes , and Will was sure he had  | memorized every item , the brown liquor jugs in particular . " How much for Snake Stick to do this ? " he said . Will thought quickly . " All that lays on this blanket , " he said . " Or , all the whiskey in these . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not go to Shawnee . " Again he was taunting . " I have to have faith iri the honor of Snake Stick . And if you betrayed me thataway , all the Cherokee septs would soon know . ' Cause I 'd tell ' em of my disappointment . " " Dead English could tell no stories to Cherokees . " " I am your guest . " " After you leave Snake Stick 's town , you not guest . My braves could silence you . " " I reckon they could . But some of your braves would have to die to silence me . And the rest would know you lacked honor . You could never silence that . " Will was sweating inside his clothes . He knew such talk was dangerous , but he felt that boldness , not timidity , was the only answer to Snake Stick 's taunts , or threats , or whatever they were . He does n't intend to do such a thing anyway , or he 'd be a fool to talk about it , Will thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If Snake Stick take all this to his Shawnee brothers , and they say is not enough for Mer English and Bettie Dra-pah ? " " Then you bring it all back here and send for me , and we 'll talk again . " He was banking on the hope that this Cherokee would be persuasive on his behalf , rather than haul all this up to the O-y-o country and back in vain , or simply do nothing and make himself a rich man . However well or badly Snake Stick might do , Will could see that this transaction would take until next summer at least . His dear ones well might have been killed or lost or ruined by then . They might be lost beyond all findin ' already , he thought . Or changed beyond all redemption . But y ' ca n't let yourself think like that , he told himself . Y ' ca n't do a thing without faith . Even if havin ' faith is just a matter of foolin ' y'rself as long as y'can.  | MARY sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her toes . They were the only colorful things she had seen for two days in the grim and shadowy valley . The colorful toes glowed through her lassitude and held her attention . They were gray-blue with bruises and there was bright red blood oozing out around her toenails . Ghetel 's feet were the same . Now that they had entered this valley , the luxury of walking through the level , grassy , leaf-strewn O-y-o bottomlands was a memory . Here every mile they walked was a gauntlet designed to bruise and abrade their heels and ankles and cut their soles and stave their toe-bones . The bottomlands and creekbeds were littered with boulders and splintered logs , jumbled stones and pebbles , the rock debris and forest trash that had been sliding down the mountainsides since Creation . They had not eaten anything for four days except a handful of acorns they had found under an oak at the top of a bluff they had climbed to shortcut a bend in the river . They had made several such shortcuts . Perhaps they had saved themselves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition it seemed that they had added five vertical miles . They would pull themselves up the steep hillsides by roots and rocks and shrubs , pausing every twenty feet or so to hug the slopes and breathe against the ground until they could raise the strength to go on a few more feet . Then , after resting a few minutes on the ridges with the  | raw wind whipping them , they would start down the opposite slopes , more sliding than walking , slamming into tree trunks and stone outcrops , slashing and bruising their flesh and tearing their dresses . Now even their precious blankets were growing tattered at the edges , and had snag-holes in them . Ghetel had falled into a profound and gloomy silence in these last two days , speaking only to answer direct questions and sometimes not even then . Now Mary looked up from her own pulsating , stinging , aching feet and glanced over at the old woman , who was contemplating her own . Suddenly Ghetel turned her head and caught Mary 's eyes with a malevolent stare and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I listened to you , " she said . Ah , Lord above , Mary thought , give me a little miracle , for I 've got to try to cheer the old thing up yet again . " Aye , dear , " she said , forcing a benign smile . " Y 've listened to me , an ' we 've come more'n three hundred miles with no hurt t ' speak of , eh ? " " I hurt . " " Eh , well . I feel same as you , not m ' very best ever . But I 'm whole , an ' y 're the same . An ' damn'ee , we 're no squaws . Keep in mind , Ghetel m ' darlin ' , we 're free as birds ! " Ghetel looked incredulous at this cheery lecture . Finally she said , indignantly : " Free as birds ? Eheh ! You know how free is a bird ? Alvays a bird goes here for a seed , and he goes dere for a gnat . And dat 's all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets enough . So dere for your freedom of a bird ! Hah ! " Mary was delighted by this outburst . So the old woman 's brain was still alive after all ! She grinned into Ghetel 's wrinkled scowl . " Well , y'see then ! We really are as free as birds , then , ai n't we ? " And Ghetel , after scowling for a moment , actually laughed . It was a little miracle . They had come to recognize hickory , walnut and oak trees from a distance , and would go to them if they were accessible . The season for berries and wild grapes was past , but there were still nuts to be found  --  sometimes .  | Now they were toiling up a steep , rock-studded slope toward a pair of likely looking hickories , a few yards above the river , whose shaggy bark made them conspicuous . Mary had given Ghetel her pointed lance to use as a walking-staff , as the old woman seemed to need its support more than she did . As they climbed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the rustling leaves on the slope . It was a dry morning , without wind for a change , and except for the sounds of their progress and the wet murmur of the river below , a vast silence filled the valley . The winter-stripped trees were stark , and without foliage to screen it , the hard angularity of the terrain was forbidding : mountainsides tilting skyward , V-shaped ravines full of mossy boulders and detritus , huge fallen tree trunks strewn like jackstraws on the slopes and in the gullies or sometimes leaning half-fallen , hung in the branches of other trees . Some of the mountain ridges ended abruptly in sheer gray rock cliffs facing over the river . From some of these rock faces , water seeped and dribbled and darkened the rock , and in places , mountain springs and freshets would simply spew over the ramparts of such cliffs into space , disintegrating to mist before reaching the valley floor . When Mary and Ghetel reached the hickories they found that squirrels had been working there before them . The ground below the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutshells , but most of the nuts were gone and the few that remained were marked by the dark little pinholes that meant worms had already invaded the nutmeats . The two women scratched over the leafy slope for fifteen minutes for a yield of a dozen good nuts . Like most of their recent disappointments , this gave Ghetel an excuse to glower in silent accusation at Mary . They sighed and sat down on a lichen-mottled slab of limestone , to break the nutshells and get to the tiny breakfast within . Mary pulled the tomahawk from her belt and , before she could crack the first nut , Ghetel said : " Gif me the ax . " " Mmm ? Well , wait , I will . . . " " Now . Me first . " Mary shrugged , and started to hand it to her , to humor her as she had done so often recently , when a sudden caution turned in the  | back of her mind . Ghetel already had the hickory spear , and if Mary gave her the tomahawk too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both their weapons . Mary hesitated . She was surprised by the thought , by what seemed an unwarranted suspicion . Surely Ghetel would not hurt her . And yet she could not shake off that strange whisper of dread . " Gif me , " Ghetel said . " Ahm , would y'give me the spear there first ? " Mary asked , as nonchalantly as she could . " W'y vant dat ? " " Because I , uhm , I want t ' poke about in the leaves and see if I can find a few more nuts . This is scarce enough t ' keep a bird alive . " She offered the little bird joke to try to gauge Ghetel 's frame of mind . But the old woman 's eyes only narrowed and she held out her hand for the tomahawk . Mary held out her hand for the spear , and fir a moment they sat there like that , the tentative uneasiness hanging between them , until Mary began to fancy that , even if this dread were only a product of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of having both weapons , even if she had not been thinking of it before . " Give me the stick , please , " Mary said through such a tight throat it almost came out a whisper . She chose to call it the stick , not the spear , lest she betray her fears . " Ach ! Like a child ! " Ghetel sighed , and picked up the stick and extended it to Mary . Point first , Mary noticed . And when she closed her hand around the stick , Ghetel closed her hand around the tomahawk handle . They exchanged them simultaneously . Am I imagining all this ? Mary wondered . If so , then indeed I must seem childish to ' er . And as Ghetel bent over her hickory nuts with the tomahawk , Mary , with the familiar spear shaft in her hand , remembered the strange ghastly feeling she had had watching Ghetel tear off the little arms of the frog . I 'm a-gettin ' too spooky , she thought . I 'm a-gettin ' feelings I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratched among the leaves with the stick , looking for more nuts while keeping Ghetel in the corner of her eye , when she gives me back that tommyhock , I 'm a-gonna  | cut me one o ' these hickory saplin 's hereabout an ' make another spear . The overcast sky that afternoon was swept a shimmering blue by a northerly breeze . The last rags of the sun-washed clouds disappeared up the valley , and the towering landscape , ridge after ridge , brightened from the colors of lead and pig-iron to silver and brass . The leafless trees were engraved in clarity : white and tan limbs , blueblack shadows . Cliff faces a mile away showed their flinty details as if they were close enough to touch . The women were picking their way over the shingle at a river bend , gingerly placing each step of their bleeding feet among the rocks , when they heard a small clatter off to their left toward the river 's edge and looked up and saw the fawn . He was a little white-tail , a few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high on his stilt legs away from them , looking back over his shoulder at them , as much in curiosity as fear . He was out on the end of the shingle , almost at the water 's edge . Both women at once seemed to realize that they had him cornered on the point , being between him and the woods ; they heard each other gasp and whisper and each saw the other turn the point of her spear toward him . Mary could actually feel her little reserves of strength rushing to readiness in her breast and arms . Her hurting feet were nothing now as she turned toward the creature , staring unblinking at him . This was their greatest stroke of fortune yet . A hundred times more wonderful than a cold catfish lying on a creekbed . This creature could feed them red meat for a week or more . His hide could make moccasins . In her mind Mary was already building a fire , risk or no risk , to cook their first meal , to cure the rest of the flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spear-pole with both hands , angling it forward from her right hip . Instinctively , she and Ghetel were moving in concert , slowly closing the space between themselves and the animal , leaving no space for it to flee between them or around them . The fawn stopped at the water 's edge now , and turned its left flank to them , its face toward them as if it were watching one of them with each limpid brown eye . Its glistening black nose trem-  | bled as it tried to identify them by scent . Doubtless they were the first human beings it had ever seen . It still did not seem to have become afraid ; it stretched its neck toward Ghetel , who was now ten feet from it . Mary was closing in on its flank . Another yard , she thought , and I can strike . Her hands were shaking and she was almost nauseated by her desire to feel the lance plunge into that soft hide of brown and black . She heard a clatter of rock behind her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seemed to comprehend its danger . It contracted an inch suddenly as its legs tensed for flight . Mary lunged desperately at the fawn with her spear , falling forward , aware as she fell forward that something big and alive was running past her toward the fawn . Pain slammed through her knees and hip and arms as she fell on the rocky shingle . Hooves were e licking in the stones a few feet away and Ghetel was roaring something , and then the hooves rattled up the shore and away and something hard skittered along the rocks in that direction . Mary opened her eyes and looked back over her shoulder to see the fawn and a doe , its mother , springing like jackrabbits down the shore and t hen out of sight up a wooded slope . Ghetel 's thrown spear slid to a stop among the rocks behind them . Mary put her face against the pebbles and winced and sobbed and waited for the physical pain to go away . She knew from her cold and empty feeling and from Ghetel 's abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be with them much longer than this of the stone bruises . " Ah , Ghetel , this looks t'be a lovely , fat an ' juicy ' un ! " " Eh , May-ry ! And here ! This one makes a feast for a kink ! " Mary was holding up a brown stalk she had pulled from the mud at the water 's edge . Mud-clots and water dribbled from the gray root . Ghetel had just torn some nameless scrub-plant from between two rocks and was brushing dirt off its reddish-brown taproot . They had been acting this way , desperately silly , since their failure to kill the fawn . For a few hours after its escape they had wailed and prayed and fallen into silent rages of frustration . Then , as if freed from any more hope of getting meat to eat , they had been swept with a wave of giddy cheerfulness  --  even Ghetel  --  and had  | returned to foraging for anything that grew within reach , whether they knew it was edible or not . They had stopped at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off handfuls of the buds and eaten them like nuts as they stumbled along . It was like eating wood , though often more bitter . Some of the buds were too hard and fibrous to chew with their loosening teeth , so they would soften a mouthful of them in their saliva until they could chew them apart and swallow them . And they would pretend to each other this way that they were indescribably succulent and delicious . It was a dismal joke , but it was a joke and they would repeat it and repeat it and break out in high , wild laughter , the steep mountainsides echoing the laughter . Then there had come a time when they could not bear to chew another dry , tough bud , and they had remembered arrowleaf tubers . They could not find any arrowleaf stalks along these swift waters , but they began to see every sedge and cattail as a banner signaling the location of some succulent root or tuber below . They began pulling up whatever the ground would let loose of , and chopping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirt off the roots and rhizomes they had gathered , and continue upstream , mincing on their bruised and lacerated feet , making desperately high-spirited remarks about the delicacy of what they were eating . Some of the roots really were not too bad . Some were crisp and could be snapped between the fingers like turnip flesh , and easily chewed , tasteless or bitter or spicy in flavor . Others , no matter how promising their shape or color , were nothing but wood . Some of these woody ones , however , had soft and palatable bark that could be gnawed off before the root was thrown away . And others , they found , had tough and stringy bark that was bitter and inedible , but inside the bark there would be a whitish or yellowish core with the consistency of a potato or onion . The tomahawk was indispensable to the task of digging these and getting to the flesh of them . The women were spending perhaps two hours of every day on their hands and knees , going nowhere , digging and chopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blade grew nicked and blunt and less useful . Mary experimented  | with different kinds of stone and finally learned to identify the kinds that would whet steel . And so she was able to keep an edge on the weapon  --  nay , she thought , it 's no more a weapon , it 's a tool ? despite its rough usage . Every time she would pull up a new root or pull down a withered berry and start to put it in her mouth , she would think fleetingly : pray this'n 's not poisonous . She had heard the menfolk talk about poisonous plants and berries and leaves , and she herself knew precious little about them . She would simply look at one a moment , and if she got no forebodings , she would try to eat it . She had learned to trust her forebodings . And anyhow , she would think , the big poison of all is to have nothin ' , nothin ' , nothin ' whatsoever in th ' belly . Poison or no , this diet included many things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afflicted by a succession of fluxes and blockages , nauseas and intoxications they had never experienced before . One day both of them began vomiting helplessly , spewing up green fluid and undigested plant fiber , until they were empty , then continued to heave up nothing until they were too weak to get to their feet . They hardly slept at all that night , a night of cold moon and shimmering frost on the ground , owl-hoots fluting among the mountaintops , disturbed every few minutes by the sudden explosive spasms of their own retchings . By the next morning they were feverish and yellow-faced and covered with cold sweat , but the spasms had moved deeper , now clutching at their bowels until they would double over in agony and pray to die . By that afternoon they were stopping every few yards to excrete scalding gray waters . Then even that went dry while the need continued . Mary would stop , not hearing Ghetel 's footsteps behind her , and would look back to see the old woman squatting on the trail redfaced , groaning as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not move . Then it would be Mary 's turn to squat and strain without success . And then there came the trouble with seeing . The river would suddenly turn black ; cliffs would turn yellow . Mary would see two Ghetels , Ghetel two Marys . Once a huge blob of darkness with blazing white edges ballooned out of the ground in front of Mary  | and swallowed her with a rush of noise  --  hissing and voices  --  and then left her standing , weaving , in a landscape piercing white and shadowless as if illuminated by lightning . And then these things , or some of these things , would cure themselves , and the women would be lucid and even-tempered again for a while , and would try to determine which of the roots or berries or buds had poisoned them , so that they could avoid them next time . But of course they had no way of knowing , as they had tried anything they could chew and swallow , so they were doomed to be overcome every few days by the same afflictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a resurgence of that brave good humor that had first incited Mary 's admiration on the day of the running of the gauntlet . Mary studied her from time to time and marveled . It 's almost more than I can bear at my age , she thought . And she 's two times my years at least . Once the old woman must have been quite fat . Mary had noticed , when first seeing her at the Shawnee town , that her frame was massive and her flesh was loose as if she had lost perhaps thirty or forty pounds of fat between the time of her capture and the time of her arrival at the Indian village . Now there was nothing massive about her any more . She was burning her flesh up from inside . She was a framework of heavy bones draped with a hide that once had been full and now was empty . Wrinkled folds of flesh hung from her arms like thrums on the sleeve of a hunting coat . Her breasts drooped like empty wallets and the skin of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hose ten sizes too big . Her shanks were covered with running sores . Her nails were split and broken and caked with black dirt . Her unruly white hair was matted with twigs and leaves and filth , and much of it was coming out . There were sores around her ears and scalp where she had scratched constantly at lice , and from the end of her nose there perpetually hung a string of snot . Her eyes were sunk in wrinkled red pouches and her face was cadaverous . Somewhere once quite long ago , Mary had seen a face that looked like this , and she had been trying to remember where , and now suddenly with an awful jolt she remembered : In Philadelphia when she was a little girl , in the cellar of a house nearby , neighbors had discovered the body of a derelict  | woman who had crawled in there and died as much as a month before . Mary , with other children of the neighborhood , had had a horrified glimpse of the corpse as it was brought out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's twin . Yet here was this wretch , looking fully like a cadaver that would not lie down ; here in this roaring huge wilderness , in this valley where surely no white human had ever been before , except Mary and her fellow captives last summer , here was Ghetel , refusing to die yet , sitting here at this moment on a boulder tearing strips of cloth from the rags of her dress to wrap around her feet , still trying to take care of herself . The old muffled horse-bell still hung useless from her neck like a pendant . " Ah , " the old woman said , looking at her new footgear and then turning to smile at Mary . " Now I make a pair for you , eh ? " Mary choked back a sudden swollen ache in her throat , and the old hag-face shimmered beyond a film of tears . " Thankee , yes , Ghetel . Yes , God lov'ee ! " Mary stopped , aghast . She stood there leaning on her spear , an awful panic of confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river mouth . It came out from between two mountains swift and deep , and swirled into the river they had been following . It was not just another river course to be detoured ; worse , it was a river that did not exist among the succession of landmarks in her memory . For days she had been watching the opposite bank for that whitish beach that would be the salt lick where she and Bettie and Henry had camped and worked on the way down . That salt lick was supposed to be her next landmark . She had not noted a river here . " Vat ? " asked Ghetel , who had stopped beside her . I ca n't tell ' er . I must n't tell ' er I think I 've got us lost . She 'd kill me sure . " Vat ? " Ghetel repeated . " Oh , m'dear . Just another tiresome walk-around , is all . " She forced herself to smile . " But we sh 'll make quick work of it , sha n't we ? Sha n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what t ' do aboot rivers in our way , do n't we ? " And so they turned south and west , though the compass in her  | head said south and east . And as they climbed over cold mossy boulders and snarls of driftwood , she ransacked her memory ; she tried to remember where they might have taken a wrong turn ; she tried to keep from lying down and giving up . The dark swift water rushed by , almost beneath their feet . Mary looked down into it with a dreadful longing . She was thinking how simple and quiet it would be , how easy it would be to terminate this infinity of miseries , to find eternal rest from this struggle , to take one step sideways off this rock , into this nameless river .  | AS if reflecting her somber doubt , this canyon blackened as they climbed , crawled and hobbled up its twisting course among the mountains . Much of the rock debris underfoot was black , and there were wide strata of gleaming black rock along the cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright cold weather , deepening the gloom of the valley , dulling the details of the forests . The water looked like ink . Ghetel 's brief period of good humor seemed to be guttering out like a candle under the influence of this hellish gorge and Mary 's own dark preoccupation . They went along in grim , laborious silence , hearing only their rasping breath , the sliding and grinding of shale and rock underfoot , the ominous , hollow rushing of the dark river and the moan of the wind in the trees high on the hillsides . The leaves had fallen out of Ghetel 's beloved bell , and now it clunked dismally as they struggled along . I just do n't remember this black valley , Mary told herself time after time . If I 'd come by it once I 'd not have forgot it . I remember a valley farther up where the stone was blue . But I do n't remember this black valley . I 'm sure I 've never been by this black valley ! She kept watching the opposite shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha ' come to th ' salt spring by now . Surely . If n we were on the proper river . Once her heart leaped when she saw a line of white at the shoreline in a riverbend ahead . There , she thought , wanting to shout it , there 's the salt spring ! But when they drew abreast of it , she saw that it was not a white  | beach , but the swift white water of a riffle . The shores were relentless black and gray . She sank to the ground and re-tied on her feet the strips of cloth , which had grown pitch black . " What a bleedin ' dirty place , " she muttered , looking up at the crumbling black cliff at their backs . " Have y ' ever seen th ' like ? " " Yah . Coal , is all . " " Oh , aye ! But it is , ai n't it ? " She had seen coal in Philadelphia , but only in wagons , on the way to hearths . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can not eat coal , " Ghetel said . " Ghetel , leave me be awhile . I have t ' think . Go look f'r victuals . Something . But leave me be . " Mary sat for a long time on the rock , pondering . She shut her eyes and made herself concentrate . She had never thought this hard . She would concentrate on landmarks and their sequence as she remembered them , and tried to separate from them all the disorientation she had been suffering since entering this valley of coal . She put her mind far back to the day of the massacre at Draper 's Meadows and came day by day through her memory down the New River , the fording places the Indians had used , the burning spring , the salt lick , to the O-y-o , past its tributaries to the Shawnee town , on down to the salt lick of the big bones , and then started back up . She studied on each landmark until her head ached , trying to imagine where she could have made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would think until she was dizzy , then would breathe deep and think some more . And finally , after more than an hour , she opened her eyes . There was only one explanation , and it calmed her and made her peaceful inside : There was no way they could be lost . The river they had been following was the New River . It could not be anything else . This coal river was just another tributary . The only reason she could not remember it was that somehow she had not seen it as the Indians were bringing her down . Somehow she had failed to notice it , and that was why it had appeared so shockingly , so unexpectedly , today , and thrown her into such a whirl of confusion . It was just another tributary that , like the others , they must cross when they could and then descend on the other side to regain the New River .  | She saw Ghetel sitting on a log nearby , rocking back and forth with her arms folded over her belly , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after a fashion , " said Mary . " I too prayed . " " Good . Now let 's us cross this river . " They went in gasping with the shock of the cold , there at the riffle . It was the only shallow place they had seen , and although the water was alarmingly fast , the day was growing old and Mary was very impatient to get across it and back down to what she was now sure was the New River . She was beginning to feel that if she slept a night up in this black valley she would never get her sense of direction straightened out thereafter . The spear-poles helped . With them , they sounded the rocky bottom that they could not see , and they leaned on them when the current pushed hard against their bodies . They prayed all the way across . They got back down to the river mouth before dark . Mary guessed they had walked some eight miles up and eight miles down that gloomy gorge . Those miles , and the strain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that they were forced to sit and rest every ten minutes or so by the day 's end . There was no light left by which to search for food . Their blankets were still damp from the crossing and from two or three brief rain showers that had fallen during their descent through the canyon . The rags on their feet had been worn or torn through by the stony passage of the day . Both women were further weakened by the scouring bowels that had been draining their vigor for days . And now with dusk came a slow , steady rain that promised to continue much of the night . Mary hurt in every joint , and her heart seemed to be fluttering more than beating . A few feet above the river mouth they found the hulk of a great beech tree that had long since fallen . Its center was rotted out , leaving a cavity some three feet wide , floored with the soft punk of decay and drifted leaves . Mary jabbed into the cavity several times with her spear , both fearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lair . Then they dragged themselves in , rolled into
