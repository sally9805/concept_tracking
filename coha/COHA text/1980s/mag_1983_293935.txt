An escapist extravaganza outdazzling Mardi Gras <P> It used to be a children 's romp , before the scares of chocolate-covered razor blades . Long , long before that , it was a religious occasion for their pagan elders , and now it has been taken back by the grownups-masks , costumes , witches , jack-o ' - lanterns and all . Increasingly in the ' 80s , Halloween has become an escapist extravaganza for adults , a trickless treat that more closely resembles Mardi Gras than the candy-and-apple surfeits of yesteryear . This year 's celebration will be the most raucous ever , lasting four or five days in some places , a virtual Halloweek . <P> Customs in costumes are also changing . While traditional devils , ghosts and vampires are still popular , many adult outfits are bewitching in another sense : harem robes , Tarzan loincloths , geisha girls , samurai swordsmen , plus Dolly Parton , Carmen Miranda and Lady Godiva . This year 's revelers will also be garbed as Mr. T , E.T. , gruesome beasts from Return of the Jedi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , schools of fish , brilliantly plumed birds , six-packs of beer , and , if a Denver pair repeats its act , a couple in bed , including the bed . A New York City family will masquerade as Britain 's royal family with a horse-drawn coach . An Atlantan will make the rounds as Hitler in a vintage Mercedes-Benz . A Chicago couple undresses as Adam and Eve , with only a serpent between them . This category does not find favor with the purveyors of costumes and materials , many of whom , like the Atlanta Costume Shop , now do 25% of their annual business at Halloween . Says Chicago Costume Co . Owner Mary Hickey : " In each of the past two years business has been up 25% over the preceding year . " <P> The haunting grounds range from discos and hotel ballrooms to private mansions and clubs , and museums in San Francisco , Coral Gables and Miami .

At 8 p.m. , the height of the parade , a huge spider will wriggle up the Village clock tower . At Area , a trendy nightspot , Owner Shawn Hausman will fill the club with macabre trappings such as a display in which mists rise from a pond awash with skeletons . <P> In Los Angeles , the Bonaventure Hotel 's Fantasia nightclub will award prizes for the ugliest face and scariest screamer .
