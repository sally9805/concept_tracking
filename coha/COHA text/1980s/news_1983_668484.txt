The Democratic Convention ended in acrimony and suspense Saturday night amid allegations that the leadership of the Massachusetts Legislature had sabotaged its final hours to keep delegates from taking up a platform plank supporting rules changes intended to curb the leadership ' s power . The abrupt end to the day-long gathering of 4000 Democratic activists produced the hottest controversy by far of a convention that , a number of participants privately agreed , had been about as exciting as watching the tide go out . Yesterday , however , the charge by Sen. George W. Bachrach ( D- Watertown ) , the sponsor of the rules changes plank , that the leadership had " pulled the plug " on the convention , was heatedly denied by Senate President William M. Bulger ( D-South Boston ) . " Nonsense , " he said in a telephone interview . " There are no secrets at a convention . It is ridiculous to believe that a plot was hatched . " By the end of the day , the matter that was considered major by most people , the presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anyone who has ever been to a convention knows how difficult it is to keep people on the floor , especially late on a Saturday . " Bulger said he and about 50 delegates from his Senate district delegation left the convention early Saturday evening for dinner . There had been allegations that delegates loyal to the legislative leaders were told to leave the floor to create the lack of a quorum which abruptly ended the convention . " Those reservations were made a long time ago for 7 p.m. , " Bulger said . " Usually the business of the convention is just about over by then . There was no attempt to pull anyone , and there are people in that group who would have stayed if I recommended we leave . " Nobody has the kind of control over delegates that has been alleged , and the delegates know that better than anyone , " said Bulger . The convention ended shortly before 9 p.m. , during debate on a proposed platform amendment calling for radical changes in the way the Legislature is run , when an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quorum . The platform amendment proposed by Bachrach paralleled changes he had proposed unsuccessfully in the Legislature . It called for " open and democratic selection of all leadership , committee chairmen and committee assignments in the Legislature . " It also called for limitations on the premium pay awarded to members of the leadership and to committee chairman for creation of a mechanism to force action on legislation bottled up in committee . Once the quorum call Saturday night determined that the number of remaining delegates was well below the minimum for a quorum , the convention had only two options : to vote to adjourn , or , if that motion were defeated , to continue to call for a quorum until enough delegates showed up to resume business . Not only did the rules package die under the adjournment gavel , but so too did platform planks on such national and foreign issues as a nuclear arms freeze and cutting off aid to El Salvador . On Friday night , Congressman Edward Markey and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy had joined forces in a packed meeting room at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeze platform plank . Kennedy said it was necessary to send a message to President Ronald Reagan that the nuclear freeze movement " got its start in Massachussetts and Vermont , not in Moscow and Vladivostok , " but the delegates never got a chance to vote on adding it to the state Democratic party platform . Markey , despite the lack of adoption of the nuclear freeze plank , said , " That was a risk you ran when the presidential poll put pressure on time . " It would have been nice to have the freeze as part of the platform , but I think we accomplished what we wanted and that was to bring the freeze to the presidential campaign . The issue was reflected in all of their addresses . We have their general endorsement now , " said Markey . " Bachrach said of the legislative rules amendment , " It is clear that the ( legislative* leadership knew the convention would support the rules reforms , and they pulled the plug on the convention . " The convention , dominated by supporters of Gov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislature . Bachrach charged , following the adjournment , that the leadership had " pulled " whole delegations loyal to them from the floor , but House Speaker Thomas W. McGee ( D-Lynn ) called the charges ridiculous . McGee , who openly opposed the legislative rules changes proposed by Bachrach both in the Legislature and at the convention , said he too was concerned about the lack of action on foreign policy matters . " Those should have been done hours ago , " he grumbled in dissatisfaction with the convention ' s dragging on into the night with roll call votes . Those votes , which some thought were unnecessary , took at least 45 minutes each but were allowed and sometimes encouraged by convention and state party chairman Sen. Chester Atkins ( D- Concord ) . Atkins , for instance , called for a roll call vote , despite the groans and boos of delegates , on a a platform amendment affirming a woman ' s right to have an abortion , even though a voice vote on the issue appeared to have passed it by an obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is such an important issue that it demands the full consideraton of a roll call vote . " His decision , however , led some delegates to speculate that there had been a " conspiracy to sabotage the convention " in which Atkins was part of a master plan to slow down the proceedings for so long that delegates would leave out of boredom , setting the stage for the quorum call when the Legislative rules amendment finally came up . By that time , only those who had to stay in the Springfield Civic Center and " hard core " delegates were still on the floor . The television cameras had left and so had the national media . A high platform for photographers was empty . When Atkins asked those favoring adjournment to rise , the delegates who stood were joined by the few reporters and policemen who had to stay on duty . " There is talk of plots and ploys . Doesn ' t anybody understand this was Saturday night and most people had to be or wanted to be somewhere else , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
