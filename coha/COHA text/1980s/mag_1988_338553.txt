Hong Kong ran out of patience last week . For 13 years , the British colony has served as a way station for tens of thousands of Vietnamese boat people . But last week , after this year 's flood of newcomers almost doubled the colony 's refugee population , to more than 16,500 people , the government declared that all future arrivals will be detained as illegal immigrants , ineligible for resettlement unless they can prove they are victims of persecution . Only some 10% are expected to be able to do so . Sympathy is in especially short supply for the latest arrivals , most of whom come from northern Viet Nam . <P> As boats filled with refugees arrived in Hong Kong harbor last week , police went aboard to inform the passengers of the new policy . The refugees will be held in detention camps , probably for years , until the Vietnamese government agrees to take them back .
