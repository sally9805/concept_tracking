txt AS A MERCHANT marine officer in World War II , Capt . George D. Butler dodged German submarines on the Murmansk run . He ducked Nazi fighters off Omaha Beach . He survived the Battle of the Atlantic . So apnfronting the economic adversities of the Great Lakes , shipping industry should be no big deal . Yet , Butler believes he is about to embark on the toughest fight of his life ? attempting to ? Vernon Jarrett is on vacation . ' ' establish a successful containerized shipping busi ? ness to Western Europe from the Great Lakes . U be wins his bout , Butler will have helped build a foundation for revitalizing the region 's failing maritime industry . For he will have demonstrated that you ca n't keep a good , energy-efficient trans- ? portation mode down . BUT IF HE falls , it will show that Midwestern ' businessmen have neither the acumen nor the brains to support the nation 's fourth seacoast . The bottom line , of course , is whether Capt . Butler can compete with the tidewater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry through political clout . Tidewater interests have successfully persuaded federal bureaucrats to deny the Great Lakes a fair share of government cargoes that serve to attract ? international shipping to those ? waters . These interests also have successfully blocked efforts to expand the Great Lakes shipping season ' so that the regional mamma industry will have a chance to compete with tidewater ports . As a result , the lakes have been virtually emptied of the overseas vessels that could haul the containerized cargo produced the industrial might of the midwestern heartland . NOW , CAPT . BUTLER intends to act on his own . As president of World Shipping , Ltd. , a Chicago-based firm of steamship agents , Butler has contracted for two freighters flying the Spanish flag to offer a total of four round trips this season between northern Europe and Chicago and Milwaukee . He is calling the service the Rotterdam Express , 16 days from the Great Lakes to Europe . And he is planning to use a unique concept that will combine the shipment of bulk and container cargo on the same ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like chemicals , industrial clay , and possibly grain . Then he will load containers full of lumber and manufactured goods on the decks . The bulk cargo , he explained , will furnish the meat and potatoes revenue for his venture . The deck containers , he hopes , will be sheer gravy . " The other guys lost their shirts because they concentrated only on containers , " Butler said . " We figure the business can be profitable by combining bulk and container cargo . " Look at it this way : When you add containers on deck , above the bulk commodities , you cut down costs to shippers . " The vessels are going to call at Chicago and Milwaukee this year , anyway . They already are ? under contract . So why should n't shippers avail themselves of the opportunity to load containers ? " The two freighters ? the Inma and Lorena ? hope to cut into the container business that now is moving by rail from midwestern locations to Montreal or the tidewater ports for overseas shipment . The last seaborne container @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manchester Liners , Ltd . Manchester Liners pioneered the feeder service to Montreal with the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway more than 20 years ago . But with its decision to abandon the service this year , the future of Chicago 's new $15-million containerized shipping port at the mouth of the Calumet River has been placed in jeopardy . UNDER BUTLER 'S plan , the container-bulk cargo carriers will sail directly to Rotterdam , eliminating the transfer of cargo to ocean-going vessels in Montreal . Each of the 450-foot-long freighters will carry about 6,000 tons of bulk commodities , plus the equivalent of 80 , 20-foot-long containers . The ships will initially offer voyages in May , June , August , and October . " We hope to get Chicago back into a volume container business , " Butler said . " I have a firm conviction that we 're going to make it . " Since Illinois is the largest exporter of all 50 states , producing an estimated $10 billion annually in agricultural and manufactured goods , the potential certainly is there . Now , if only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he faces the toughest fight of his career .
