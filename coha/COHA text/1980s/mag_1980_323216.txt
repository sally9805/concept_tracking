Ghost Sonanta <P> EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF Directed by Jean-Luc Godard Screenplay by Anne-Marie Mieville and Jean-Claude Carrire <P> For two decades , Jean-Luc Godard has been cinema 's master of collage . His films assemble scraps of dust-jacket wisdom , revolutionary rhetoric , sexual aggression , the music and the language of the streets , images from books , TV , magazines and billboards , forming a mosaic that melds the graphic wit of a Braque guitar with the anarchic intensity of a kidnaper 's ransom note . In Every Man for Himself , the first Godard film to be distributed in the U.S. since 1972 , he has tried to make an accessible movie while still speaking in his steely , ironic voice . But Godard will not be compromised . The collagist keeps us at a distance . The movie screen is impenetrable . <P> Until 1960 , film was primarily a representational art . Then Godard and his fellow iconoclasts suspended disbelief like a taut high wire across which his characters danced and ambled , and sometimes fell off . There are " people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Godard ( Jacques Dutronc ) , his co-worker and ex-mistress Denise ( Nathalie Baye ) , and her friend Isabelle ( Isabelle Huppert ) , who works as a prostitute and has a short session with Paul . But they are not " real people . " They are figures in the desolate landscape of Godard 's mind . They have materialized to illustrate his deepest , bleakest conception of man and woman : the childish brute and the soul survivor . <P> What propels virtually every Godard male into treating women as a caveman would a woolly mammoth ? Is it fear or loathing ? Every Man is a catalogue of bestiality . A seedy businessman orchestrates a four-person roundelay of sexual degradation . A man casually asks Paul : Have you ever thought about sodomizing your eleven-year-old daughter ? Later , Paul verbally flogs the girl with sexual epithets.This is man , Godard is saying ; I am man.Give credit where it is due : Godard has no fear of exposing himself on film . " Paul Godard " ( his father 's name ) is an admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serpents slinking out of the eye sockets . <P> The Godard female has often been a prostitute . She expresses his vision of every man-woman relationship , and serves as a metaphor for the personal film maker in a tawdry art-industry . But Isabelle , in Every Man , exists simply to endure : to suffer the indignities of venal clients , and to survive with her mystery intact . She is a modern , unsentimental version of the silent-screen innocent who is noble not because of what she does but because of what men do to her . She is touched - indeed , pawed and probed - but never moved . And that is her revenge on the male of the species . <P> The credits announce that this is " a film composed by Jean-Luc Godard . " Every Man is shaped in the form of a sonata , with thematic variations expressed through recurring images and lines of dialogue . But this is a ghost sonata , and the specter is that of the old ( young ) Godard , the director of Breathless and Weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit . His new film , however confessional , seems clinically detached . Its heartbeat is irregular and indistinct , like signals from a dying star on the other side of the universe.And its message for the human race seems to be : every man for himself , and Godard against all .
