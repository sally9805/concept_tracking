FADE IN : 1 A GOLDEN GLOW dominates the SCREEN . FRAME RIGHT , a stripe of highlights churn in a changing pattern . . . slowly we realize the whole LEFT two-thirds of the FRAME is turning . FOCUS to show an eight-foot bronze cylinder revolving on its axis . As it turns , a steady stream of strange gold letters come into the light and disappear around its edge .

The two men carry a strange steel cage suspended by a staff between their two ponies . The arms of the contraption are twisted in irregular geometric patterns , ominous shapes that carry a mystical meaning . A small brown bird swoops through a diamond-shaped opening in the cage . Instead of exiting through one of the equally large openings on the other side , the bird flaps around wildly inside . For no apparent reason , it 's trapped . The little brown bird flutters around desperately , beating itself hysterically against the bars , until its broken , dead body drops through the opening at the bottom . This is no ordinary cage .

Til tries to think of something to make the game more interesting . He picks through the pile for something special . . . Nothing . He chooses a little pebble and lets go .

Chandler slips the gun into his belt and struts out toward the neighbor 's driveway that runs along the fence . 78 IN THE NEIGHBOR 'S YARD - DAY Chan walks along the eight foot fence into the neighbor 's backyard . He senses something and looks over his shoulder . There 's an entire family standing around their barbecue , watching him suspiciously . Chan turns and slams his palm against the fence and turns with a smile . &nbsp; CHANDLERThis side 's solid . Got ta check the back . 79 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about getting out of this business , Chan hops the neighbor 's small fence into the alley .

She slides across the seat and gets out of the car .

HER POV Eight DRAGONS stand up against the wall looking at her . &nbsp; DRAGONCome on in . The one closest to the door swings it shut . One of the Dragons reaches for her . She twirls backward , her foot makes a SHHHTTTT as it cuts the air and a THWAP as it slams into his face . In a continuous motion , she whirls around again , catches him as he staggers , and he drops to the ground . A couple of guys leap out of the line and circle her . One charges . . .

They rush her simultaneously . She pushes one by her , kicks the second , and grabs the arm of the one with the knife and brings it down on her knee . There is a sickening CRACK , and she finishes him with her elbow . Kee Nang whirls and staggers the final Dragon with a kick to the face . Kee Nang whirls the opposite way .

He smashes through the plasterboard wall and slumps to the floor . The second Dragon charges her and she kicks him in the groin , leaps in the air and double kicks him to the head . He skids down the hall , comes to a stop , and does n't move . 90 BACK TO CHANDLER Chandler is strung by the neck , rotating slowly on his toes . The belt must be drying and getting tighter because he 's turning red and looks nervous . The four Dragons are rifling through the contents of Chan 's pockets and arguing about what to do with the body . &nbsp; DRAGONI do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff him in a garbage bag and dump him off-road in Los Padres . &nbsp; DRAGONWhat if some animal drags him out into a camp sight ? &nbsp; DRAGONSo what ?

Using one of the switchblades , she cuts the ropes around his wrists and reaches up and shears the belt . Chan pulls off the belt and gasps for breath . The four Dragons look over at him . Chan puts out his arms to shield Kee Nang behind him . Kee Nang is a little surprised by the unnecessary chivalry but goes along .  --  58  --  &nbsp; CHANDLER ( to Kee Nang ) Stay behind me .

Chan gives the guy two vicious uppercuts and shoves him off . Chan turns to Kee Nang . &nbsp; CHANDLERYou all right ? She nods and gives him a brave little smile . &nbsp; CHANDLERDo n't worry . &nbsp; KEEI 'm not . The two remaining Dragons rush Chan at once . Chan hits the first with a left , but the second one clips him . He 's staggered and the guy is all over him . The first one comes back in.  --  59  --  Kee Nang checks . . .

He turns quickly with concern in his eyes for Kee Nang . She stands there truly touched by his solicitude . &nbsp; CHANDLER ( breathing hard ) You okay ? She nods in the affirmative . She stands there with a calm appraising look , not a hair out of place . She looks prettier than ever , maybe because she 's just a little flush , maybe because she 's just impressed us a great deal . &nbsp; KEEHow about you ? &nbsp; CHANDLERI 'll live . I do n't want this to turn into a lecture , but I told you to wait in the car .

As Chandler walks over toward the fallen Dragons , he throws Kee Nang a cocky little smile over his shoulder .  --  60  --  &nbsp; CHANDLERI thought you were the one supposed to be protecting me . Chandler yanks the biggest Dragon off the ground . He drags him over to the sink , shoves his head under , and turns on the faucet . The Dragon sputters to consciousness . &nbsp; CHANDLERYou had a girl tattooed with a yellow dragon . What happen to her ? ! &nbsp; DRAGONHuh ? Chandler slams him in the gut and the guy makes a real effort to remember . &nbsp; DRAGON ( gasping for breath ) What girl ? &nbsp; CHANDLER ( shoving the Polaroid in the guy 's face ) This girl !
