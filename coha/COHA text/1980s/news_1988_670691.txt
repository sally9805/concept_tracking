In the twilight of the Reagan Administration , Mr. Crocker , the State Department ' s highest-ranking official on Africa , is winning praise from friends and foes alike for his tenacious pursuit of what has proven to be an elusive goal : the withdrawal of South African and Cuban troops from Angola and independence for Namibia after more than 70 years of South African rule. // This week , negotiators meeting in Brazzaville , Congo , reported some progress in the latest , precarious round of talks among the United States , South Africa , Angola and Cuba toward achieving a timetable for the withdrawal of 47 , 000 or more Cuban troops from Angola . <> <> Accords That Collapsed // But the participants , like most African specialists outside government ranks , are skeptical and quick to recall that the last time when agreement on southern Africa seemed imminent was in the late 1970 ' s , during the Carter Administration . Even a signed agreement might not hold if a new Administration did not move quickly to carry it out or if either South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don ' t think South Africa will give up Namibia unless all of its security terms are achieved , " said Pauline Baker , a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . " It ' s a very fragile house of cards. " // Mr. Crocker himself recently said that the countries involved face " a road of many obstacles " with tough political decisions ahead. // Many of Mr. Crocker ' s critics maintain that if there is movement toward a settlement , it is not because of Administration policy , but in spite of it . Even within the Administration , officials acknowledge that the prospect of a settlement is largely due to outside forces - ones beyond American control . <> <> U.S. Election Breeds Uncertainty // Among these forces are the Soviet Union ' s desire to reduce its entanglements in regional conflicts , a large Cuban buildup in Angola , unfamiliar battlefield losses and white casualties by South Africa , economic pressure on Angola , and a shared war-weariness shaped by the perception that the best chance for a settlement may be with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa Report , the Democratic candidate for President , Gov . Michael S. Dukakis , pledged to reverse current policy on Africa by ending aid to Angolan rebels and recognizing the Luanda Government . And it is unclear whether a Bush Presidency would pursue Mr. Crocker ' s policy with such conviction. // But for Chester Arthur Crocker , a former academic and a direct descendant of the 21st President , a settlement would mean the vindication of a stategy contained in his 1980 article in the journal Foreign Affairs that both helped get him his post as Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs and that became the basis for the Reagan Administration ' s policy in southern Africa. // It was then he first articulated the now-moribund idea of " constructive engagement , " arguing that the confrontational approach of the Carter Administration toward South Africa had cost the United States credibility and influence with the ruling Afrikaners , and that more progress could be made toward reforming the apartheid system if Washington worked with , rather than against , the Pretoria Government. // The strategy had another goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace with its neighbors by pushing for a resolution of the conflict in Namibia . <> <> Confidence Proved Premature // A disciplined , chain-smoking , intensely private man , Mr. Crocker was so sure of an imminent breakthrough in southern Africa after he took over as Assistant Secretary in 1981 that he confidently told African specialists in and out of Government that Namibia could be brought to independence within 18 months , a deadline that he had to extend repeatedly over the next seven years. // Elements of his strategy were vilifed on all sides . Congressional conservatives charged that his pragmatism outran his anti-Communist zeal . Liberals derided him as an apologist for racism in South Africa. // The South Africans expressed doubt about his ability to withstand Congressional pressure to impose sanctions against them . And the black African front-line states accused him siding against them and with Pretoria. // Inside the Administration , he challenged Pentagon and Central Intelligence Agency assessments of the military and political strength of guerrilla movements in southern Africa , and battled ideological conservatives in the White House on the content of President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master of contrived ambiguity , " was the way Theo Ben-Gurirab , foreign affairs spokesman for the rebel South-West Africa People ' s Organization , once described him. // " Chet is sometimes a very lonely man , " said Herman W. Nickel , former United States Ambassador to South Africa and a personal friend. // The low point for Mr. Crocker came in 1986 after Congress overrode President Reagan ' s veto of sanctions against South Africa . Senator Richard G. Lugar , the Indiana Republican who was then chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , asked Secretary of State George P. Shultz to replace Mr. Crocker because he had lost his credibility on Capitol Hill . What was left of the phrase " constructive engagement " disappeared from the Administration ' s vocabulary , although the Administration still defends its underlying tenets. // " Probably his deepest regret is coining the term ' constructive engagement , ' " said a State Department official who has worked closely with Mr. Crocker . " Once he put out the slogan , people were free to define it as they wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <> <> Shultz ' s Full Backing // But Mr. Crocker , who enjoys the confidence of Mr. Shultz , stayed . He never contemplated resigning , according to his wife , Saone Baron Crocker , a lawyer and the daughter of a prominent lawyer in Zimbabwe . A survivor , he has served in his post longer than any of his predecessors , aided by an extraordinary pragmatism and an ability to incorporate policy approaches he disagrees with into his overall strategy. // At a meeting in Cape Town in 1981 , for example , it was Elliott Abrams , as Assistant Secretary of State for human rights , who was responsible for proposing to South African leaders that South Africa withdraw from Namibia in exchange for a Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola . This was put forth in spite of Mr. Crocker ' s reservations , according to officials and former officials in the Reagan Administration familiar with the meeting. // Mr. Crocker argued that such linkage would call into question the legal status of United Nations Security Council Resolution 435 , adopted in 1978 , which calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets out a transitional plan for the territory ' s independence . When he lost the debate , however , he quickly accepted linkage and now touts it as one of the strengths of American policy that has made a southern African settlement closer. // Similarly , Mr. Crocker vacillated at first on whether the United States should supply military aid to Jonas Savimbi ' s rebels in Angola . He argued that such a move would complicate peace efforts by undermining a negotiating structure he had painstakingly built with Angola and South Africa by adding a second objective - national reconciliation in Angola . <> <> Aid Cutoff Ruled Out // But he embraced the idea when it became policy and now defends the Administration ' s promise that aid to the anti-Marxist rebels would not end even in the event of a settlement. // Mr. Crocker ' s critics accuse him of a barely concealed contempt for people he considers ill-informed , and say this has hurt his ability to curry favor with political opponents. // In the Foreign Affairs article , he advised Americans to " do their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babble of voices from South Africa . " In the corridors of the United Nations , African envoys still enjoy recounting an anecdote about the time that he once told a senior black African official who requested American support on a policy that the United States was not engaged in " toilet training. " // Even members of Congress who respect his persistence express exasperation with his reluctance to share information or integrate their views into policy. // " I don ' t want to be the skunk at the garden party , and if he gets an agreement , I ' ll be the first one to give him credit , " said Representative Stephen J. Solarz , Democrat of Brooklyn and a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee . " But he has been unwilling to take Congress into his confidence even in closed sessions , and in any parliamentary system , he would have been obliged as a matter of honor to have resigned a long time ago. " // Still , Mr. Crocker is widely given credit for his emergence as a mediator who has won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old enemies . His boosters hope that if a settlement is reached before the end of the Administration , he will be rewarded with an even more important post , such as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs , if Mr. Bush is elected President. // Mr. Crocker himself is so secretive that even his wife says that she doesn ' t know his intentions . " When I ask him what he ' ll do next , he says , ' In a job like this , you can ' t think about what you ' ll do next , ' " // " He says , ' You have to keep focusing on what you ' re doing now. ' " //
