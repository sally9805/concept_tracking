When Nicholas Daniloff was ensnared four weeks ago in a KGB trap , it was thought the tense game of pawns that ensued would prevent any progress on arms control or toward a Soviet-American summit . Instead , something quite different occurred . Movement on arms control increased , and so did hopes for a year-end meeting between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev . As a result , the dog seemed to wag the tail for a change : the desire to reach an accord on the major issues dividing the superpowers created an eagerness to resolve , as quickly as face-saving maneuvers would allow , the dispute involving the U.S. News &; World Report correspondent and Gennadi Zakharov , the Soviet U.N . employee awaiting trial in New York City on spy charges . <P> From the beginning , the Daniloff affair ( which now encompasses not only the arrest of Zakharov but also Washington 's order to expel 25 Soviet employees from the U.N. ) has been seen as a ready gauge of the desire in Moscow and Washington for progress on larger issues . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way would be found to untangle the affair . That forced both leaders , after months of dithering , to face squarely the question of how badly they really desired to meet again . The answer : badly enough to give their diplomats a go-ahead to negotiate a face-saving compromise . <P> A series of meetings between Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze at the U.N . in New York City uncovered the outlines of a potential bargain : Daniloff would be released quickly and probably without any trial on what the U.S. regards as trumped-up espionage charges against him . Zakharov would be traded later for one or more Soviet dissidents . The expulsion of the 25 Soviets at the U.N . remains a sticking point . <P> The significance of all this activity went far beyond the fates of Daniloff and Zakharov , and even beyond the prospect of another chance for Reagan to sit by a fireplace with Gorbachev . The goal that suddenly seemed in sight was a potentially important breakthrough in arms control . Both sides have been quietly inching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range nuclear forces , one that for the first time would significantly reduce  --  rather than just set a ceiling on  --  the number of nuclear weapons . At the U.N . last week , Reagan and Shevardnadze raised hopes for a quick agreement ; in ( Geneva , Soviet and American negotiators are close to filling in some key numbers . The emerging deal : the Soviets would drop their insistence that any INF accord be linked to ones involving long-range strategic arms and space- based defensive weapons ; INF warheads in Europe would be slashed to a " token " 100 on each side , representing a cut of more than 85% in the number of Soviet SS-20s now threatening U.S. allies . <P> None of this is yet guaranteed . In addition to the remaining complications surrounding Daniloff 's release , there are disputes over details of any INF pact  --  both with Moscow and among the warring factions of the Reagan Administration . The freeing of Daniloff , even if followed by an INF deal , would leave the U.S. and U.S.S.R. still at odds over more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Reagan 's Strategic Defense Initiative ( SDI ) , or Star Wars .
