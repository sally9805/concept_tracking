In the East Everglades , homesteaders and officials square off <P> After he retired from his road-paving business in Miami , Russell Carter , 63 , acted on a lifelong dream . On five acres of sparsely settled land 20 miles west of the city , he set up a rural retreat , built a ranch house , landscaped the plot around it and stocked four new fresh-water ponds with fish . Ever since , Carter has been in deep trouble . <P> So have many of his neighbors . Jo Ann Kirkland , 42 , was arrested and taken away in handcuffs . When a pesky bureaucrat called on Tom Cartier , 41 , a retired nuclear reactor construction worker , he tossed the official into a pond where his pet alligator Pocketbook holes up ( the man was unharmed ) . Vows Cartier : " I wo n't be threatened on my property . " <P> The eye of this Southern squall is a 242-sq. - mi. area at the tip of the Florida peninsula known as the East Everglades . Like Everglades National Park , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with palmettos and sawgrass , marshes and wildlife . And that is the problem . Eager to escape Florida 's crowded , condo-filled coast , the homesteaders have picked one of the state 's most ecologically fragile regions , essential to the environmental well-being of all of South Florida . <P> Much of the peninsula was once a great natural sponge of swamps , marshes and flood land that trapped and filtered fresh water . But to clear the way for development , as well as to control floods , these wetlands have been largely drained away . This has not only threatened the quality of surface water but also cut off its flow into underlying aquifers , the porous rock formations that serve as subterranean reservoirs . <P> Today very little untouched wetland remains , especially in Dade and Broward counties . They get much of their water from a formation called the Biscayne Aquifer , extending from Miami on the east to the Everglades on the west . But heavily populated Miami and its environs draw so much water that the water table is rapidly falling , permitting sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everglades , where the land over the aquifer is still unpaved , can this reservoir be effectively resupplied . To make matters worse , Florida has been suffering through a decade of sparse rainfall , which has dried up many swamps , at least temporarily . This year the drought is so severe that Governor Bob Graham declared South Florida a disaster area and approved plans for $450,000 worth of cloud seeding . <P> In spite of the East Everglades ' ecological importance , government agencies took little notice of the new settlers until a real estate boom was well under way . Now at least 600 people live in the area . Most bought their property before 1978 , when the Environmental Protection Agency began a $1.2 million East Everglades study that became part of a national wetlands preservation program . Many put up dwellings without building permits . Those who dug water holes rarely bothered to tell the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , which supervises wetland areas . When officials finally served summonses and cease-and-desist orders , some were run off at gunpoint .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
