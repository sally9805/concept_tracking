Now that the show has finally been officially unveiled , it ' s easier to see what makes it tick , and perhaps what so many prescient theatergoers sniffed about it in advance . " La Cage aux Folles " is an extravagantly produced , old-fashioned family musical containing likeable characters ( who , whatever their sexual preferences , are people , not cats ) , a sentimental love story , sumptuous sets and costumes - and , that rarity , new songs that can be hummed on the way home. // It also has two stars who act their parts with rare charm and conviction . It ' s particularly moving to watch Mr. Hearn - whose previous Broadway credits include " I Remember Mama , " " A Doll ' s Life " and " Whodunnit " - finally originate a Broadway role that shows off his resources as strongly as did his brief turn as Len Cariou ' s successor in " Sweeney Todd . " An actor of both dynamism and wit , as well as a powerful singer , Mr. Hearn triumphs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less extravagant part , proves a most sensitive foil - far more sensitive than you ' d ever guess from his starring roles on such television series as " Bat Masterston " and " The Name of the Game. " // Given these real virtues and its overall line of attack , " La Cage aux Folles " might be a hit even if its heroes were Internal Revenue agents . We don ' t see many shows in this one ' s anachronistic style anymore , and it ' s a vacuum that was aching to be filled . When an old-fashioned musical arrives on Broadway now , it ' s either an outright revival or a show like " 42d Street " or " My One and Only " that has been built around vintage songs : Whatever their other attractions , such musicals can ' t pack that special thrill that comes when we discover a pretty melody in a theater for the first time . Our new- fashioned musicals , meanwhile , tend to be spectacles built around a somewhat static theatrical idea ( " Cats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dreamgirls , " " Evita " ) or abrasive accounts of contemporary alienation ( " Nine " ) . " La Cage aux Folles " isn ' t better than all these shows , but it isn ' t like them , either . It ' s a throwback to the kind of hit musical that dominated Broadway before rock music was invented , before revivals and revues were ubiquitous , and before innovators like Michael Bennett and Harold Prince opted for building musicals around themes and Brechtian staging techniques instead of storybook plots. // Indeed , " La Cage " is in the exact tradition of " Hello , Dolly ! " and " Mame , " the two hits that its songwriter , Jerry Herman , turned out just before fashions in the musical theater began to change for keeps in the late 1960 ' s . There ' s nothing wrong with that - we can and should have all kinds of good musicals - and it ' s fun to watch the old conventions clicking again , even as they ' re adapted for a new sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headdress under an arch of dazzling lights in " La Cage aux Folles , " you may swear that the clock has turned back 20 years and Carol Channing is once again being welcomed back where she belongs. // What ' s disappointing about " Cage aux Folles " - though by no means fatal - is that the old conventions aren ' t always as well executed as they were in a musical like " Hello , Dolly ! , " and that some of the show ' s crea // tors use them as an excuse to sanitize and even falsify their work ' s content . If the first Broadway musical to see life from a " different angle " ( as one lyric has it ) wants to be square and schmaltzy , that ' s fine - and certainly shrewd . But within that format - especially within so safe a format - there ' s still plenty of room for sophistication and passion . " La Cage aux Folles " could have used more of both , just as it could have used a choreographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Curiously enough , in a group of collaborators that includes Mr. Fierstein and the director Arthur Laurents - both of whom have written reasonably outspoken non-musical plays about homosexuality ( " Torch Song Trilogy " and " The Enclave , " respectively ) - it is Mr. Herman who is the musical ' s most openhearted contributor . To be sure , Mr. Herman is writing the same kind of Tin Pan Alley music ( and at times prefabricated lyrics ) he always has - he has no interest in being fashionable and probably never will be . Yet there is an edge and force to some of his work here that he has only hinted at before ( especially in his score for the unsuccessful " Mack and Mabel " ) . The originality and range of Mr. Herman ' s songs aren ' t enormous , but to see how much he has grown within his range , just compare the heroine ' s defiant but synthetic Act I finale of " Dolly , " " Before the Parade Passes By , " to the equivalent Act I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to homosexual pride called " I Am What I Am , " tumultuously delivered by Mr. Hearn in a manner that recalls Ethel Merman ' s " Rose ' s Turn " in " Gypsy. " // Mr. Herman ' s man-to-man love songs , sung with tender directness by Mr. Barry , also lace their buoyant melodies with feeling . Though " La Cage " contains a few numbers that are well beyond its songwriter ' s reach - a deadly comic piece about " Masculinity " cries out for the devilish lyrics of Stephen Sondheim or Fred Ebb - the soul of this show is always conveyed by the better songs and the stars ' renditions of them. // Mr. Fierstein ' s feeble book , on the other hand , tries to push that soul back into the closet . In the dialogue , Georges and Albin are presented as bland , saccharine saints - so innocent of verbal wit and sexuality that they have no sexual identity : They ' re fatherly monks who might play the nuns of " The Sound of Music " in handball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club are scarcely more racily ( or humorously ) written , even though one of them does brandish a whip . They ' re even more bowdlerized than the striptease dancers that Mr. Laurents created in his book for " Gypsy " almost 25 years ago. // // It ' s hard to explain this cautiousness . While " La Cage aux Folles " may be the first Broadway musical to feature homosexual lovers , homosexuality has been prominent in other Broadway musicals ( including " A Chorus Line " ) , not to mention any number of popular , mainstream Hollywood movies and Broadway plays ( of which Mr. Fierstein ' s is the most recent but far from the only example ) . Yet the caution is so pronounced in " La Cage " that it even extends to the transvestites ' dance numbers , which , the drag costumes aside , are less sexually provocative in their use of androgynous sexuality than , for example , the Bob Fosse choreography for Broadway ' s " Chicago " and the movies " Cabaret " and " All That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the transvestites in " La Cage " occurs not in the show proper at all , but in the curtain call - when an unexpected twist ( not to be divulged here ) forces us , as Mr. Hearn ' s " I Am What I Am " does , to see how much dignity , courage and conviction a drag queen can bring to his illusionary , self-invented feminine identity. // Was everything else toned down in " La Cage " out of a desire to flatter the audience and avoid the slightest risk of offending a single member of it ? It certainly looks that way - especially by the time we meet the bigoted heterosexual villains of the piece , who are so overdrawn that they seem calculated to make even the audience ' s homophobes go home congratulating themselves on how tolerant they are by comparison . One can ' t help wishing that the creators of " La Cage " had given enlightened theatergoers more credit , had challenged the prejudices of the less-enlightened - and had not assumed that the common denominator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor ) is somewhere in the nether reaches of the Nielsen ratings. // One also wishes that a little more time had been spent to perfect a production that is so lavish and high- powered . In addition to the score and star performances , much about " La Cage " is splendid - including the speed and outrageous stunts of Mr. Laurents ' s staging and the shimmering romanticism and ingenuity of David Mitchell ' s sets , Theoni V. Aldredge ' s costumes and Jules Fisher ' s lighting . But why does it take a half-hour for the plot to begin , and why is the story ultimately resolved so confusingly with the sudden use of a character ( a restaurateur ) we ' ve never met before ? Couldn ' t someone have rethought the summer-stock casting of the supporting roles ( Georges and Albin ' s son grins like a gameshow host ) or the overlength of the dance numbers ? And why are there so many American inflections in the acting and lyrics of a production whose every visual flourish successfully transports us to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ' s hard to imagine , though , that too many of the show ' s customers , past and future , will feel that they ' re not getting their money ' s worth from " La Cage aux Folles . " At its best , this musical is splashily enjoyable , and if its less courageous collaborators try too hard to pander to everyone , it is they , not the ticket buyers , who are paying the higher price for that failure of nerve. // //
