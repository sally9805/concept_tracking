Mr. Roe is the only Democratic candidate - and the only nonmillionaire in either party - to turn down public financing . He has no personal wealth to throw into the contest and realizes this will make fund-raising more difficult , but he hopes to make his opponents ' use of public funds in times of tight Federal and state budgets the cutting issue in the campaign. // " We ' re emphasizing the old techniques - get a friend , get a buck , make the system work , " said Bea O ' Rourke , the Roe campaign ' s field director , who is known as " Mother Superior " to her fellow workers . " And I haven ' t had so much fun in years. " // // 3 , 000 Republicans Help // Next door to the campaign ' s state headquarters in Wayne Township , on Route 46 in a former shopping mall , is the Passaic County headquarters . There Grace Gurisic , the county field manager , and her cadre of 175 volunteers reached their goal of getting 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat so they can vote for Mr. Roe. // " Many of these people have never voted in a Democratic primary in their lives , " she said , " but they support the Congressman , so we ' ve asked them to become ' Democrats for a Day for Bob Roe. ' // " When they leave the voting booth , we ' ll have postcards for those who feel uncomfortable about staying in our party to mail in to the Election Board and regain their membership in the Republican Party. " // Mr. Roe , who has been in Congress since 1969 and finished second to Governor Byrne in the 1977 Democratic primary , with 134 , 116 votes , believes he has a base that can best be strengthened by the type of traditional campaign that depends on recognized party officials and workers to carry the message. // In Passaic County , State Senator Frank X. Graves serves as campaign manager ; in Bergen , it is Freeholder Doris Michalik ; in Hudson , Mayor Dennis Collins , who also is a director of the state campaign ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in Camden , Mary Keating Croce , a former State Assemblywoman . Another former member of the Assembly , Rosemarie Totaro of Indian Lake , is a deputy state campaign manager . <> <> Three Essentials Claimed // Daniel Horgan , a former executive director of the Democratic National Committee , is Mr. Roe ' s campaign consultant . " To be effective , " Mr. Horgan said , " a candidate must have three things - credibility , an ability to raise money and a base - and we have all three. " // " Because we ' ve decided not to take public funds , our campaign must be more people-oriented and depend on grass-roots activities to get the message across , " Mr. Horgan continued. // " We ' re spending our time and treasure on party-building , something no one else is doing . We believe it ' s important if we ' re to meet the challenge of a resurgent Republican Party in the general election. " // In his campaign literature and personal appearances , Mr. Roe is emphasizing his experience as Mayor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official and Congressman . He has sponsored public works bills that provided millions of dollars for public projects in the last few years , and this year he became chairman of the House subcommittee on water resources , enabling him to conduct publicized hearings on the current water supply problems in the Northeast . <> <> Environmental Programs Backed // " When I was Commissioner of Community Affairs in Trenton , " Mr. Roe said , " we began the Green Acres program to preserve open space and designed and laid out many of the environmental programs being carried out now . If we are to have economic growth in the future , we must now follow through on programs to guarantee an adequate water supply that were planned when I was in Trenton , and to meet the disposal problems posed by toxic waste and solid waste. // " In a very few years our operating landfills will be closed and we will have to look to other methods of disposal . The technology is available to convert some of our garbage - after removing the metals - into ethyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy. " // But it is on the issue of public financing that Mr. Roe is able to separate himself clearly from the 13 other Democratic candidates . His aides admit it is a calculated gamble , one that forces them to raise $3 for each $1 raised by an opponent , since public financing provides $2 for $1 for qualified candidates , up to a maximum in public funds of $600 , 000. // However , each day of demonstrations by elderly citizens or women ' s groups over the Reagan Administration ' s cutback in Federal aid for programs affecting them gives Mr. Roe something to talk about in front of these groups . <> <> Opponents ' Spending Criticized // In a reference to his opponents , Mr. Roe told a gathering of elderly citizens : " They ' re spending millions of dollars to put their pictures on television , while you ' re paying more for your prescription medicine and waiting for promised transportation aid. // " When you see the signs that say , ' This commercial paid for by friends of , ' remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they ' re being paid by you ! " // The Roe campaign has raised more than $300 , 000 in contributions of all sizes . While most campaigns emphasize the larger gifts - up to the $800 limit on individual gifts - the Roe campaign has appeals that fit every denomination , right down to the " Give a Buck for Bob " slogan. //
