Traveling with the President in the campaign s last hours , TIME Correspondent Christopher Ogden provided the following report on Jimmy Carter 's painful moment of truth : <P> When Jimmy Carter flew back to Washington on Sunday to handle the hostage crisis , he thought he was in good shape in the polls taken daily by his own expert , Pat Caddell . He had gone into the Cleveland debate one to two points ahead of Reagan by Caddell 's soundings , and the trend was in his direction . " It looked good , " said one of the President 's aides . By Friday , however , the debate results seemed to be taking effect . Jody Powell spoke of a " pause in momentum . " Carter had dropped about four points , to one or two behind . But he was still in striking distance . Sunday , new figures had moved the President to five behind . He would have to campaign Monday , and so out he went . <P> The long day was nearly at an end when Carter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday night . Hamilton Jordan was on the phone from Washington with Powell . As the plane came in to land , the connection was broken . On the ground , Carter was rushed into the hangar packed with more than 1,000 cheering supporters and gave one of the best speeches of his campaign . <P> He was exhausted but exhilarated . It was over , and he felt a win was definitely possible . As he leaped off the stage to work the crowd , some junior staffers surprised him by putting on the public address system his 1976 campaign theme song . The tune had not been played since his last campaign . Carter started to choke with emotion when he heard it . <P> In the meantime , Powell was reconnected with Jordan . The President 's chief political strategist had bad news . Caddell had just come over with his latest poll figures . Carter had dropped to ten points behind Reagan . The lead was insurmountable , Caddell had said . Jordan told Powell the election was lost . Powell was profoundly shocked . Carter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the plane for the long flight back to Georgia , Powell readied himself by pouring a stiff drink . He said he needed one to break that kind of news . But before he could collar the President , Carter was back in the staff cabin , talking with Domestic Affairs Adviser Stu Eizenstat and Rick Hertzberg , his chief speechwriter . They had been pleased with the day . The aides agreed that the last appearance had been great . Powell was agonizing . Carter then went back farther in the plane to ask the press pool to come up with him to the front for a chat . That lasted another 45 minutes . Carter still did not know he had lost before the polls even opened . <P> Finally , after they were in the air more than an hour , and Carter had finished a double martini , Powell got the President alone . Calling him " Governor , " as he often does in private , Powell passed on Caddell 's findings . Carter was devastated . He could n't believe it . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said an aide . " They had just never even considered the possibility of losing . "
