Argentina 's messy bankbooks <P> Is Argentina $37 billion or $43 billion in debt ? Last week Argentine leaders were asking that billion-dollar question . Only three weeks after an international rescue squad of public and private lenders had saved Argentina from missing the deadline for a $500 million interest payment , that country 's finances appeared to be a more confusing mess than ever . <P> Buenos Aires conceded last week that it does not even know exactly how much the country owes . Official estimates over the past year have ranged from a low of $37 billion to a high of $43 billion . In an effort to determine the true amount , some 100 civil servants are combing through 6-ft. - high stacks of records at the central bank in Buenos Aires . So cluttered has that building become that the searchers have been forced to expand into new quarters next door . <P> Much of the confusion is due to the military government that ruled Argentina from 1976 until last year . Says Hector Valle , who served on a commission that has been probing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , that the former regime did n't keep any close reckoning of what it spent . " Among the sketchily recorded outlays was an estimated $5 billion used for the 1982 Falklands war . Earlier disbursements of nearly $6 billion may have been lavished on such items as procurement of military hardware and the movement of troops . Adding to the confusion is the fact that Argentines may have quietly shifted up to $20 billion , including sums borrowed from foreign lenders , into bank accounts in the U.S. , Switzerland and elsewhere . <P> American bankers , who believe that Argentina owes around $46 billion , are professing little concern over the country 's bookkeeping mess . " Each bank knows exactly what it is owed , " said one New York moneyman . He added , " You 've got a lot of people doing the job for the first time down there , and it will just take a while to sort out . " Bankers point out that Venezuela ( estimated debt : $34 billion ) also has untidy bookkeeping , but Mexico ( $85 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records . <P> Last week some unexpected details of Argentina 's eleventh-hour rescue became known . It was revealed that officials of the U.S. Federal Reserve assured private lenders that the $100 million they contributed to the bailout would be repaid . The Federal Reserve told banks that Argentina had more than that amount on deposit with it and that those funds would be used to pay off the loan . Given that indirect guarantee , the private banks charged an interest rate that was only one-eighth of a percentage point more than what they charge one another on loans .
