One day in 1985 Mae Roberts of Holladay , Utah , was having trouble opening a plastic two-liter bottle of Diet 7-Up . So she took a wrench to it , as she had many times in the past , but the results were disastrous . The top shot off like a champagne cork and struck her in the left eye , destroying most of the iris . <P> Last week a Salt Lake City jury ordered the Seven-Up Co. and a local bottler to pay $10.5 million in damages to Roberts , 82 , who is legally blind in her injured eye . A lawyer for Seven-Up said the company would appeal because Roberts used the wrench to twist the cap in the wrong direction . <P> Roberts ' attorney , Colin King , told the jury that hundreds of lawsuits have been filed in the past 15 years over eye injuries resulting from exploding soft-drink caps . Some beverage companies , such as Canada Dry and Schweppes , put labels on their products to tell consumers that they should open the bottles carefully . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to point the things away from your face when you open them . "
