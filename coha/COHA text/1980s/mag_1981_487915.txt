Just a few days after the November elections , the Na- tional , Conservative Political Action Committee ( N. C. P . A.0 , commonly known as " Nick-pack " ) held a news conference to announce its hit list for 1982 . It was a brassy , audacious gesture that rubbed the Democrats ' noses in the enormousness of what they had lost on November 4 . That so many people came to listen was testimony not only to the emergence of the New Right as a hot political story but also to N.C.P.A.C. 's sudden prominence on the national political scene . Almost unknown until the 1980 elections , its bitter , and largely negative , campaign  --  that is , one directed against , not for , a specific candidate  --  made it , if not a household word , at least a name not to be taken lightly in the House or in the Senate . In 1980 , N.C.P.A.C. targeted with its dollars President Jimmy Carter and six Democratic Senators ? Birch Bayh of Indiana , Frank Church of Idaho , Alan Cranston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of South Dakota and Thomas Eagleton of Missouri . With the exceptions of Cranston and Eagleton , all were defeated . For 1982 , N.C.P.A.C. has mailed , among others , Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts , Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio , Donald Riegle Jr . of Michigan and Paul Sarbanes of Maryland . The activities of N.C.P.A.C. have been heralded as the opening shots in a new era of the electoral battle : the rise of the ideological political action committee unaffiliated with either of the major parties . Only it is not the PACs that are independent  --  it is their expenditures . An independent political action committee 's expenditures are considered independent because the committee is not aligned with any one candidate or party ; its financial outlays must be made without the candidate 's ( or his authorized committee 's ) knowledge or approval . Beyond this requirement , there is no limit on the amount a PAC can spend on any candidate ; nor do its expenditures count against the $29.4 million limit imposed on Presidential candidates who accept public financing . ' N.C.P.A.C. is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest spender in 1980 . That Jane Stone is the editor of The Congress Watcher , a Public Citizen newspaper . Public Citizen is an organization founded by Ralph Nader. distinction fell to the Congressional Club , a North Carolina-based group whose honorary chairman is Republican Senator Jesse Helms . The Congressional Club spent $4.6 million during the last election , with virtually all the money going to Ronald Reagan 's Presidential campaign . ( It has jaised $2.4 million during the first six months of 1981. ) 4 . C.P.A.C. was the second largest spender , disbursing almost $3.3 million . The total expenditures of independent PACs in the 1980 elections were $16.1 million . That is twenty times the amount recorded in the 1976 elections , when independent campaign spending first came into . wide use . While the most recent reports on PAC spending come from Federal Election Commission ( F.E.C. ) data on PAC contributions to campaign treasuries , this is the first analysis of the money these PACs have spent independently . My analysis of the F.E.C. figures shows that 81 percent  --  or $13.4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980 elections was disbursed by the ideologically conservative PACs . Liberal PACs spent less than 1 percent of the total ; labor PACs , 0.4 percent ; corporate PACs , 0.3 percent ; trade association PACs , 10.4 percent , and individuals , 6.4 percent for the major spenders , see bbx . Independent PACs spent $6 million for Reagan , as compared with $18,500 for Carter . Even though it is unclear what their effect will be on upcoming elections  --  and how much they had to do with the conservative victories of 1980 , for that matter  --  the conservative PACs are here to stay . " History has shown that it is never possible to separate the power of money from the power of politics , " said a lobbyist for the Christian Voice Moral Government Fund . " Election laws just ' do n't work . " But even the most ardent conservative candidates accept the embraces of the New Right PACs somewhat sheepishly . Not that they-are unappreciative of the PACs ' efforts ; they are , hbwever , . reluctant to be too closely identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ label opponents " baby killers . " Consequently , the recipients of conservative PAC money try to downplay its effects . This is exemplified by the remarks of Senator Charles Grassley , who was the beneficiary of the commercials described above in his race against liberal incumbent John Culver in Iowa . N.C.P.A.C. , Grassley told the press after his election , " had a somewhat negative impact " on his election bid because of the " flamboyant " and " negative " campaign the group ran against Culver . To which a spokesman for the Christian Voice Moral Government Fund commented : " That 's O.K. He probably had no other political choice but to berate us . We just wanted him in office , and if deriding us will help him stay in office , that 's O.K. by us . " N.C.P.A.C. 's efforts in the Grassley-Culver race were a textbook case of independent conservative political action committee strategy : hit ' em , hit ' em often and hit ' em anywhere you can . Independent PACs are the shock troops of the New Right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terrence Dolan , the committee 's chairman . " We 're going to beat them and send a shiver down the spines of ... senators and congressmen . " " Images are important , not issues , " Dolan explains . " We start early and use repetition and it 's bound to have an impact . Start with an image like George McGovern does n't represent South Dakota . Keep hitting away . That 's more effective than George McGovern did or did n't do X , Y or Z for South Dakota . " / Dolan said his organization would attack a targeted senator with a barrage of radio commercials running as often as seventy-two times per day and television commercials as frequently as 200 times per week . " By November , " Dolan boasted , " there will be people voting against him without remembering why . " Dolan asserted that these tactics could elect Mickey Mouse to the United States Senate . " We were in the league with N.C.P.A.C. and other groups in using an attack ? philosophy , " said Mark Longabaugh , research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trade associations and other business groups do n't do that as often , because they are more concerned with buying access to candidates . " The independent committees scorn the latter approach . Rather than winning the ears of a hundred candidates , they prefer to defeat a carefully selected half dozen . In 1980 , they concentrated on raced " where we felt we could make a difference , " as a staffer at the National Rifle Association put it . - Such relentless pressure by the PACs can cause a backlash against their own candidates . Many PACs focus on emotional , polarizing issues  --  issues that the candidate might prefer to downplay in the interest of coalition-building . Independent expenditures can also disrupt the efforts of the candidate and his staff to-retain control over the campaign . If you ca n't , by law , even be aware of a PAC 's activities , there is theoretically no way to monitor them . " Independent spending is not a reason for glee by the candidate , " said Mark Green ; an unsuccessful liberal Democratic candidate for Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " an inevitable tension between a campaign staff planning its own strategy and an outside group trying to influence a campaign . Running a campaign is a delicate operation ' , and you select those few things that maximize your assets : and minimize your opponent 's . Quite likely an outside group coming in to do things for your campaign that are out of your jurisdiction would be inconsistent with your strategies and , therefore , counter- , productive . " T n practice , candidates and the independent PACs have found imaginative ? 74.3rs to circumvent the prob- lem . " It was easy for ug to , communicate through the press , " said an official for the Christian Voice Moral Government Fund ) , " We would tell the press what we were going to do and they would print it . If the candidate did n't like it , he could tell the press and chances are they would print it . Then the PAC would find out and change its strategy . " and But how much are all these plans , ads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 1980 elections provided few clear answers . One political observer commented : " N.C.P.A.C. is like a rooster who takes credit for the dawn . There were definitely other forces which led to the defeat of liberal Democratic senators . " A postelection analysis published by Congressional Quarterly came to a similar conclusion : " Republican- officials and many of the candidates who- ousted liberal Democrats said the New Right 's role was minimal , and in some cases , harmful to their campaigns . They attributed the victory to a list of more familiar factors : fresh , but experienced candidates , generous doses of party financing , apopular Presidential candidate atop the ticket and a throwthe-bums-out mood . On one point , the analysts were much in agreement : Whatever role the New Right played was due in large part to the press 's fascination with the phenomenon . " The power of the new independent PACs should noi however , be underestimated . Lance Tarrance , a Houstonl , pollster who was hired by Grassley , discovered a significant N.C.P.A.C. effect very early in the Iowa race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of the blitz , the incumbent was weakened before a challenger had even been chosen . " In 1979 , it was not altogether clear to people where Culver was ideologically , " Tarrance said . " He was seen as slightly liberal . . . . By the summer of 1980 , Culver was perceived to be very , very liberal . That was not the result of Grassley 's campaign . He was busy getting the nomination . " Public-interest groups have challenged - independent spending on the ground that it is a way to skirt the campaign finance laws Common Cause , which helped push through the 1974 election financing law , hasi filed suit against Americans for Change , a conservative group headed by Senator Harrison ( Jack ) Schmitt , a New , Mexico Republican . The suit , which failed in the lower courts , is now pending in the Supreme Court . Common Cause argues that unlimited independent spending will destroy the entire system set up in 1974 to regulate campaign financing and set spending limits . Thus far , the courts have ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1976 , the Supreme Court ruled in Buckley v. Valeo that supporters of Federal candidates may spend unrestricted amounts in elections as long as they do not coordinate their spending with the official campaign . Dissenting , Justice Byron White expressed the fear that independent spending would result in " transparent and widespread invasion of the contributions limit . " As a result of the ' unsuccessful attempts to stop independent spending , many progressive groups have decided that if you ca n't beat them , join them . " Independent spending is effective , deplorable and probably not preventable , " according to Mark Green . " The only constitutional antidote to right-wing spending , however , is left-wing spending . " In this spirit , a number of progressive groups have begun raising money to act as a counterweight to the influx of conservative spending . Groups such as McGovern 's Americans for Common Sense , former lobbyist Victor Kamber 's Pro-PAC , Norman Lear 's People for an American Way , Kennedy 's Fund for a Democratic Majority and Independent Action have set up research operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PACs . " The New Right has demonstrated that there is a market for PAC activity . We will be a small PAC , but hopefully we can work with other- liberal PACs to counter some of the New Right gains in the last election , " noted Wally Chalmers , the executive director of the Fund for a Democratic Majority . " There are many approaches a PAC can use when disbursing its funds . N.C.P.A.C. and the rest showed that there is plenty of room for innovation in spending . " Kamber 's Pro-PAC hopes to be the left 's answer to N.C.P.A.C. It will spend the major part of the money it raises in direct-mail solicitations in carefully chosen races . fai - What will this influx of money do to already high cam- aign costs ? It appears that if the courts do n't step in , there is nowhere to go but up . Only about 110 PACs of the more than 2,000 in existence spent independently in the last election . And only twenty individuals madQuse of this provision in the campaign financing laws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , many more will make use of the loophole . ?
