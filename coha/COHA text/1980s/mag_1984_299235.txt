HURLYBURLY by David Rabe <P> Eddie ( William Hurt ) has a desperate urge to make connections . " I do n't know what pertains to me , " he cries , striving to locate defining links between himself and the world as he feverishly scans the political news in the paper or tries to make sense of the post-Freudian gabble of his friends . Distracted , he abuses emotional ties that are so close at hand he could touch them were he only to reach out . His best friends have simplified these problems : tough Phil ( Harvey Keitel ) makes most of his conjunctions with his fists ; Artie ( Jerry Stiller ) is hooked into the only thing that matters to him , his career , via his answering machine ; Mickey ( Christopher Walken ) simply accepts the ad hoc life . For him all liaisons are intrinsically temporary , and cynicism , laced with drugs , is his sustenance . <P> The four live in Los Angeles and work on the fringe of show business . But David Rabe 's Hurlyburly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great deal more than just another satire of the Southern California lifestyle . Rabe 's characters would essentially be what they are no matter where they lived or worked . As he sees it , there is a limbo of the lost through which American males of a certain age and status almost inevitably must pass these days . Divorced , not loving their abandoned children as much as they loathe their former wives , directing a combination of need and hostility toward the women who drift in and out of their new lives , they are , as Mickey puts it , " involved in a variety of pharmaceutical experiments , " which , as Eddie completes the thought , " test the American dream of oblivion . " Another way of putting it is that their lives are full of incident and devoid of coherence . <P> Artie brings home a girl ( Cynthia Nixon ) as a " care package " for his friends . " She worked the last time I tried her , " he explains . Eddie and Mickey already share a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvelous ironic contrast to her dithering sensibility ) . Phil steals his own child , beats up a bubble dancer ( Judith Ivey ) and finally kills himself . At the end , Eddie is frantically leafing through the dictionary , hoping to find in his pal 's suicide note an anagram that will reveal the meaning in an apparently meaningless act . <P> In the anguish of that search lies the profundity of Rabe 's work . The playwright is functioning here as far more than a realist with an unsurpassed ear for contemporary speech . What he is saying , finally , is that words have begun to fail . The vocabulary in which his people speak , a jargon derived from televised reductions of reality and popularized psychology , leaves them without the tools they need to know their own minds , let alone the complexities of their shared existence . The bitterest of the many laughs Rabe provides derives from his recognition that the relentless articulateness of his people is only a higher form of inarticulateness.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
