The Fall of the House of Usher ' ( 1839 ) , Tales ( 1845 ) '  | The narrator is a boyhood friend of Roderick Usher , the master of the House of Usher and sole male heir of an ancient family , who has lived for years in a remotely situated house with no companion but his sister the lady Madeline ' . A desperate letter from Roderick , admitting his acute mental and bodily disorder , has summoned his friend to the house in the hope that the cheerfulness of that friend 's society will alleviate its owner 's illness . As this paragraph makes plain , no such alleviation is forthcoming , for the narrator is clearly responding to Roderick 's disorder in ways that can only aggravate it . Evidently , he shares the nervous excitement of his hypochondriac friend . In the opening paragraphs of the tale , the most striking characteristic of the prose was its emotional intensity . The narrator approached the House of Usher ( so he tells us ) alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of country ' . He found his friend 's house melancholy ' and responded to his first sight of it with a sense of insufferable gloom ' and with an utter depression of soul ' . Before he entered the house and encountered Roderick Usher , whom he had not seen for years , the narrator felt so unnerved ' by the building and its surroundings that he imagined it to be enveloped by a pestilent and mystic vapor ' that exhaled from the decayed trees , the tarn , and the grey wall of the house . The narrator 's dismissive relegation of his own idea to the status of a dream does not alter the fact that he has anticipated Roderick 's own superstitious belief about the house ? his fear that it is sentient ' and will have a fatal influence on his own life . If this narrator is unreliable , as he plainly seems to be , the reader is not going to escape from his haunted consciousness while the tale is being told . In the passage before us , the narrator says that Roderick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel an intensity of intolerable awe ' at their abstractions . Both in his references to awe ' and in his related admission that he can not find verbal equivalents for his experiences , the narrator may be taken to imply that he has entered the realm of the sublime , though he categorically rejected the term when describing his first mood of utter depression . In his Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful ( 1757 ) , Edmund Burke had not only argued that terror is the source of sublime emotion but had also insisted that the power of the sublime lay in its effectiveness in robbing the mind of its powers of reasoning . Obscurity and vastness belonged to the Burkean sublime because they contributed to the astonishment , or the mixture of fear and wonder , that he considered characteristic of the experience . Yet the truest test of the sublime , according to Burke , was the delightful horror ' caused by the concept  | of infinity , for though we associate power with the idea of infinity we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they do by the idea of eternity . The one pictorial representation of Roderick 's ideas that we are allowed to glimpse shows us a long , smooth vault or tunnel with a suggestion of immense depth underground . We already know that Roderick 's room is immense , badly lit and has windows placed so high above the floor that it is impossible to see out of them . The tunnel he paints seems , then , to be an intensified version of his own viewless room . His painting suggests his introversion , his selfabsorption and his sense of entrapment or premature burial in the depths of his own mind . The lack of any outlet links the vault he has painted with his family name and with his own predicament . Usher ' is close in sound to utter ' , and in the denouement of the tale it will be the superhuman energy of his utterance ' that will compell the ponderous and ebony jaws ' of the door of his room to open and reveal the terrible secret of his sister 's living death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive ( albeit unwittingly ) Roderick buried a part of himself , though that other self came back from the tomb to carry him to death . The Usher family has been famous time out of mind ' , the narrator tells us , for its artistic sensibility and particularly for its passionate devotion to the intricacies of musical science , yet Roderick 's songs are dirges ' and the last waltz of Von Weber ' that provides him with a theme was supposedly written within hours of its composer 's death . His obsession with entrapment ( entombment ) and with death plainly determines his artistic performance . In the poem The Haunted Palace ' , which was first published separately before The House of Usher ' was in print , music is the central metaphor . The palace , like the House of Usher , is the poet 's mind . Before the Fall occasioned by or resulting in the assault of evil things , in robes of sorrow ' on the rule of Thought , the door of the palace ? obviously enough described in terms appropriate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glory of the intellect . While Thought ruled in the radiant place , the spirits round the throne moved musically / To a lute 's welltuned law ' . After the Fall , in contrast , grotesque forms within the palace of the mind move to a discordant melody ' and when they do achieve utterance it is as a hideous throng ' of ( madly ) laughing creatures . We know , from Poe 's introduction to his Poems of 1831 , that he considered the poet 's function to be that of presenting perceptible images . . . with indefinite sensations ' and that music was essential to this purpose because the comprehension of sweet sound is our most  | indefinite conception ' . In one of his Marginalia ' , published in the Democratic Review in 1844 , Poe suggested that music gives us a suggestive and indefinite glimpse ' of the supernal ecstacies ' denied to us while we are mere mortals . In his theory of the essential music of poetry , Poe was thinking in the tradition of the German romantic E. T. A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( published in German in 1813 and thus unavailable as a direct source to Poe , whose German was weak ) had declared that music could open to man a new kingdom beyond the range of mere words and having nothing in common with the world of sensuous reality around him . More than most , Roderick Usher needs to escape from the world of sensuous reality for that world is insufferable to his excited nerves , but music offers him no entry into a new kingdom because it too has been affected by the Fall . Instead of redeeming him , Roderick 's music only expresses his subjection to the realm of the senses . Dominated by a superstitious dread of the very house in which he lives , Roderick feels that his spirit is subject to the mere form and substance of his family mansion ' . A fallen artist , Usher 's experience of the sublime is limited to terror ? he feels nothing of the liberation , of the sense of the kindred infinity of the human soul that , as we have seen , Channing considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sublimity of the natural world . Rockerick 's taste in literature is determined by his obsession with the sentience ' of inorganic matter . The mental existence ' of the invalid has been formed , we are told , by such works as Emanuel Swedenborg 's Heaven and Hell , Robert Fludd 's Chiromancy , and the Inquisitor Nicholas Eymeric of Gironne 's Directorium Inquisitorum , or instructions for examining heretics . When we learn that Roderick 's chief delight ' was the Vigiliae Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiae Maguntinae , or Vigils for the dead according to the use of the second church of Mainz ' , a book so rare that no copy has been traced in America , ' we can only suppose that his interest in ancient rites for the dead is the consequence of a preoccupation with death and a premonition concerning his sister 's fate . Certainly the narrator thinks of the wild ritual of this work ' when he hears of the supposed death of the lady Madeline and of Roderick 's plan to preserve her corpse in the vaults of the house for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer Roderick no more help to transcend his fear and no more opportunity to escape from his mental imprisonment than the other arts can . At the climax of the tale , the gruesome scene in which Madeline escapes from the vault to return to his room and , in another fall ' , bear  | her brother to the floor in death-agonies that unite them , the selffulfilling nature of Roderick 's fear is stressed when we are told that he is a victim to the terrors he had anticipated ' . As we approach that climax , a self-reflexive note enters the fiction as the narrator reads from a book called The Mad Trist of Sir Launcelot Canning . This story , told in the unconvincing medieval ' English of Canning ? a name derived from the fraudulently medieval legends of Thomas Chatterton ? provides a parallel and parodic fiction within the fiction . The all-too-obtrusive synchronization of the climactic events in the two levels of fiction calls attention to the many-layered world of books in which tales beget tales that haunt the palace of thought . Poe allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercised their ingenuity in interpreting her as anything from a vampire to the Apollonian spirit that Roderick , the Dionysian artist , has suppressed in himself . It is characteristic of Poe to encode meanings in his fictions , but it is also his firmly stated principle to make every detail of a tale contribute to the effect ' that the tale was designed to accomplish . In The Fall of the House of Usher ' the mysterious relationship between Roderick and Madeline is plainly part of the effect . Obviously , the failure of Usher to achieve adequate expression for his anguished thoughts is connected with his inability to accept the knowledge of Madeline 's ailment or , possibly , his responsibility for that wasting away of her life . In the apocalyptic conclusion of the story , the destruction of Roderick is followed by the fall of the house as the bloodred moon shines through the fissure that the narrator had barely noticed on his first approach . Falling into fragments , this palace of thought collapses into the deep and silent waters of the tarn . The colour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haunted Palace ' and suggests madness , though ? just before the end ? we have heard Roderick call the narrator Madman ! ' . The conclusion , like the opening , implicates the narrator in the disorder he represents . The Fall of the House of Usher ' was first published in Burton 's Gentleman 's Magazine in September 1839 and took its place the following year in Poe 's Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque . To read this tale in the context of others with related themes that were included in Poe 's first collection of stories is necessarily to notice some clearly marked patterns in his early fiction . Berenice ' , first published in the Southern Literary Messenger in 1835 , is narrated by its own chief actor , Egaeus . Like Roderick , this scion of an ancient and noble family lives in the gloomy family mansion , but he is even more bookish than Usher , for Egaeus was actually born in the mansion 's library , his mother died  | there , and his earliest memories are of the strange volumes his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent in the monastic seclusion of the library : literally and figuratively he has never left the world of books . The woman in his life is a cousin who has grown up in the family mansion with him but , unlike Egaeus , she is light-hearted and feels at home in the outside world . The beautiful and healthy Berenice begins to succumb to a mysterious malady that works a terrible change on her appearance but ? significantly ? makes her more interesting to her cousin than she was when in bloom . Egaeus admits that his brain is a disordered chamber ' , for he finds that he has become obsessively concerned with physical objects dissociated from their meanings : with the typography or margin of a page of text rather than its words ; with the physical decline of Berenice rather than her moral condition and , ultimately , with her teeth , which to him take the place of ideas . ( In the versions of this story published before 1845 , a species of smile ' appears on the livid lips of the already putrescent corpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Southern Literary Messenger that the tale was far too horrible , but the gory ending , in which Egaeus wakes from a dream in his library to find that he has robbed Berenice 's corpse of its teeth , was unchanged in all versions of the tale . Berenice ' is obviously not as successful or interesting a tale as the story of Roderick Usher , but its cruder form calls attention to a concatenation of ideas that was also to be present in Usher ' : intensely bookish seclusion and introversion , melancholy and possible madness of the male ; mysterious physical decline of the female with whom he is most closely connected ; an outrage committed on the woman 's body and presumably caused by the man 's obsession with the problematic relationship between the spirit and the flesh . In Morelia ' , another tale published in the Southern Literary Messenger in 1835 , a variation on the theme of erudition occurs , for here it is the woman who is profoundly learned , but the theme of forbidden knowledge ? of mystical and probably magical writings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in The Fall of the House of Usher ' . Morella , predictably , falls into a physical decline that leads ineluctably towards death , but in dying she cries that she will live again and will regain the love of her husband ? the narrator of the tale ? whose feeling for her has been blighted by his terror of their mutual quest for knowledge . The concluding sections of the story are ritualistic , the language is incantatory . In dying , Morella gives birth to a daughter whose resemblance to her dead mother is such that her father names her Morella and hears a response from  | beyond the grave . Concern with identity , with the principium individuationis ( the essence of the self ) and the possibility of its survival after death , is explicit in this tale , for the learned allusions are to Pythagorian theories of metempsychosis , to Schelling 's theories of identity , to Locke 's conceptions of personal identity , and to Fichte 's wild Pantheism ' . The theme of life after death is also central in Ligeia ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 1838 . Ligeia , like Morella , is a prodigy of learning and leads her idolatrous lover into realms of forbidden knowledge . She resists the relentless malady that draws her towards death , for her esoteric studies have convinced her that the human will can triumph over death . She does die , but only after her supernaturally and strangely beautiful eyes have absorbed the soul of the narrator . When he remarries , he takes his new bride to a fantastic bridal chamber whose decor stridently expresses his obsession with death . Ligeia returns , in the narrator 's opium-stimulated vision , to take momentary possession of the form of the unloved and ailing second wife . In this tale , as in the two previously discussed , the narrator is the lover whose relationship with the ailing woman is so intense that her death threatens his sanity . Ligeia ' ranks with Poe 's greatest tales in achievement , but its success depends upon the reader 's willingness to accept the stylized intensity or extravagance of its plot and its language . Repeated references to opium and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , isolated settings and allusions to the fantastic display ' in the architecture and decoration of the bridal chamber , are clearly intended to avert the bathos that would inevitably result if realistic criteria were brought to bear on this tale . The world of the story is the world of the nameless narrator 's nervously overstimulated imagination . It is a disordered world that at least raises the suspicion of madness . The nervousness of the narrators in each of the four tales discussed would , in twentieth-century terminology , plainly indicate neuroses susceptible of psychoanalytic explanation . A thoroughgoing Freudian interpretation of all Poe 's works has , in fact , been offered by Marie Bonaparte in her Life and Works of Edgar Allan Poe : A Psycho-Analytic Interpretation ( 1949 ) but a less doctrinaire approach to the relationship between the life and the works has to start from the distinction between the narrators and the writer who created them . We may accept Roger Asselineau 's useful  | formulation that Poe was the writer of neuroses ' without assuming that Poe was himself neurotic . When Poe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he did in his review of Hawthorne 's Twicetold Tales in Graham 's magazine in 1842 , he insisted on aesthetic concerns , on the skilful construction of a tale . In Poe 's words , having conceived , with deliberate care , a certain unique or single effect to be wrought out ' , the writer then invents such incidents ? he then combines such events , as may best aid him in establishing this preconceived effect ' . Every word in the tale should , Poe argued , contribute to the one pre-established design ' . By stressing the design of the writer and the effect he deliberately and systematically sets out to achieve , Poe is unmistakably arguing that the writer of fiction is a craftsman whose success as an artist depends on his technical skill . Further , the theory of the short story outlined in Poe 's article diverts attention from any expressive function it may have for the writer , focusing instead on its manipulative effects on the putative reader . In the extended version of his article on Hawthorne that appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the idea ' of the tale , or its thesis ' , but here too he insisted on the essential subordination of every detail of a tale to its single effect ' . When Poe offered illustration of what he meant by the tale of effect , he did so with a shorthand reference to the earlier numbers of Blackwood 's Magazine in which , he said , many fine examples could be found . Since this allusion to Blackwood 's follows a list of points ' that the tale can legitimately treat , and since that list is composed of terror , or passion , or horror , or a multitude of such other points ' , we can legitimately suppose that each of the listed states of feeling constitutes a single effect ' . Earlier , in his apologetic letter to the editor of the Southern Literary Messenger , while admitting that Berenice ' was too horrible , Poe had claimed that the celebrated magazines ? among which he certainly would have ranked Blackwood 's ? owed their fame to articles of a nature similar to his story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Poe went beyond the range of Berenice ' , for he stated that success was produced by the ludicrous heightened into the grotesque : the fearful coloured into the horrible : the witty exaggerated into the burlesque : the singular wrought out into the strange and mystical ' ( L , I. 57 ? 8 ) . Since the purpose of the letter was to persuade the Editor to publish his stories , it is appropriate that Poe extended his account to include comic tales , but the significant pointer to Poe 's own methods is the consistent stress on heightening and exaggeration in all modes of successful tale writing . The consistently anti-didactic emphasis of Poe 's literary theories ,  | whether applied to prose ( as in his animadversions on the allegoric elements in Hawthorne 's tales ) or to poetry ( as in his lecture The Poetic Principle ' in 1848 ? 9 ) , makes it clear that his whole conception of literature was remote from Emerson 's . Assuming that the true function of literature was a religious function and that its value lay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no interest in the fiction written by his contemporaries . Poe , on the other hand , explored even his main ideas through the conventions of popular magazine stories . The point is not that Poe was less serious in his literary endeavours than Emerson was in his , but that the seriousness was of a radically different kind . The tales so far discussed were collected in Poe 's first volume of short stories , Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque , in 1840 , and like all the other tales in that collection they had first appeared in magazines . Poe was concerned to analyse the nature of the successful magazine story because he depended for his own livelihood on his ability to write tales that would be acceptable to the editors , and to the readers , of such periodicals . Poe was a professional writer in a sense that does not apply to Emerson , for he depended absolutely on the income earned by his pen . He had no private income that could be supplemented by earnings on the lyceum circuit . Poe is remembered now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tales of ratiocination , yet , in his contributions to the magazines , comic tales balanced the serious or Arabesque ' tales in bulk . Among the tales of his 1840 collection belonging to the categories of the ludicrous heightened into the grotesque ' and the witty exaggerated into the " burlesque ' were How to Write a Blackwood Article ' and the story within that story called A Predicament ' , originally published as one in the Baltimore American Museum in 1838 . In Poe 's burlesque , an apprentice fiction writer called Signora Psyche Zenobia relates her exquisite feelings while the minute hand of a huge clock severs her trapped neck . While ridiculing the crass sensationalism of the tale of extreme terror , Poe makes allusion to the sort of magazine material that he himself used . Mr Blackwood recommends to Signora Zenobia tales of burial alive , of entrapment ( in a boiler and a belfry ) that had actually appeared in British magazines after 1820 and had interested Poe sufficiently for him to use variations on these themes . Even the preposterously literal application of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Psyche Zenobia can be related to Poe 's brilliant use of the same metaphor in The Pit and the Pendulum ' ( 1842 ) , where the pendulum used by the Inquisition as an instrument of torture is also an emblem of  | man 's subjection to time . A parodic treatment of a fictional theme did not , for Poe , preclude a serious reworking of theme and effect . Poe 's first published tale , Metzengerstein ' , appeared in the Philadelphia Saturday Courier in 1832 . Subtitled , at its second publication , a tale in imitation of the German ' it makes use of the brand of terror ' that Horace Walpole had made famous in his Castle of Otranto ( 1764 ) ? the first Gothic novel in English ? substituting a gigantic horse for the enormous suit of armour that does the work of destruction in Walpole 's book . Other conventions with which Poe works in this tale include a remote and ancient castle whose lord is the melancholy heir to an ancient family . In Metzengerstein ' , the Baron who gives the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vices to him is so casual that the tale resists a solemn reading . In one brief paragraph he is credited with shameful debaucheries , flagrant treacheries ? unheard of atrocities ' ; he also has the remorseless fangs of a petty Caligula ' . In versions of the tale published before 1850 , some motivation for all this evil was provided by the early death of the Baron 's beautiful mother , but the characterization is so mechanical that the writer seems only partially engaged with his materials . Yet even here , where there are unmistakably parodic intentions , some Poe scholars have argued for a deeply serious moral interpretation of the tale . That they have done so is a tribute to the strengths of Poe 's writing in the concluding section of the story , when the fiery character of the demonic horse that embodies the spirit of the Baron 's dead rival works the destruction of Metzengerstein . Even in this tale , parody modulates into something more complex when the animal is used to express or suggest passion . The literary convention that Poe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its aspects , if unworthy in others . In his preface to Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque Poe claimed that the terror in his tales was not of Germany , but of the soul ' . By this he presumably meant that the psychological interest of his fictions was not dependent on the conventions of horror-Gothic ( he called it pseudohorror ' ) that had come to be associated with German literature . Yet , since terror was the theme in so many of his tales , subtlety of emotion or action was not likely to be among their characteristics ; extravagance in both areas was , in fact , virtually prescribed by the effect they sought . When extreme situations and heighted sensations are the staple of literary art , as in the horror-Gothic of Matthew Lewis or of Charles Robert Maturin , then there is a tendency to self-parody that makes the seriousness of the story problematic . More obviously than in the tales , this is true in Poe 's case of his novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym ( 1838 ) .  | Poe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' can not be taken to decide the question of its seriousness , and may be obscurantist , but the proliferation of horrors in the story does disconcert most readers , for the mere swift succession of shocking incidents seems guaranteed to weaken the effect of any one of them . The title-page lists mutiny , atrocious butchery , shipwreck , horrible sufferings , massacre and incredible adventures and discoveries south of the eighty-fourth parallel ' among the attractions within . Having narrowly escaped death by shipwreck , Arthur Gordon Pym and his young friend Augustus go to sea again and narrowly escape death at the hands of mutineers . Surviving the mutiny , they are reduced to cannibalism by the famine that follows the wreck of the second ship . When rescue seems imminent , and the Dutch sailor on the approaching rescue-ship smiles encouragement , Pym gives thanks to God , only to find that the smile is that of a putrescent corpse whose teeth have no flesh around them , whose eyes are gone , and whose flesh is being devoured by a bird . The theme of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of his friend , follows that of entombment . Pym was entombed in the hold of the ship in which he hoped for adventure . It is as if M. G. Lewis 's The Monk ( 1796 ) had been converted into a sea-story , for with the live burial and the rotting flesh goes an emphatic concern with deceptive appearances that manifests itself in a series of related incidents . First Pym deceives his father and grandfather in order to stow away on the ship and thus deceive Augustus 's father , who is the captain . Deception in the boys ' world of adventure is followed by adult deception in the murderous form of a mutiny , and this will be followed , when Pym has found a new ship to sail in , by the deceptive friendliness of the natives of Tsalal that preludes their massacre of the white crew . In the second chapter , Arthur Gordon Pym , whose name plainly echoes Edgar Allan Poe 's , and whose grandfather made a fortune in the Edgartown bank , tells us that he is melancholic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famine ; of death or captivity among barbarian hordes ; of a life-time dragged out in sorrow and tears , upon some gray and desolate rock , in an ocean unapproachable and unknown ' . These are not just visions , they are also desires ' , for Pym 's impulse from the start is self-destructive . But , as in the tales already discussed , the self-destructive impulse of the protagonists or narrators is inseparable from their desire for new knowledge . The quest for knowledge intensifies once Pym is rescued from the wreck of the Grampus and aboard the Jane Guy , for he urges the reluctant captain of his new ship to press on to the extreme south to solve the mysteries of the Antarctic  | continent . The voyage ends in disaster for captain and crew , but Pym survives to confront the mysteries of the chasms of the island of Tsalal , and to feel pride in opening the eyes of science to secrets hitherto sealed . For Pym 's new knowledge ' Poe drew on the theories of John Cleves Symmes , whose notion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been given considerable publicity in the United States in the 1820s . Since the Antarctic was still a mysterious and uncharted part of the globe in the 1830s , it was a fitting zone for Pym 's quest . The first instalment of the story appeared in the Southern Literary Messenger in 1837 , together with Poe 's review of Washington Irving 's Astoria , an account of Hunt 's expedition from the Missouri to the mouth of the Columbia . Poe found Irving 's book more intensely exciting than any other travelogue and wrote admiringly of the vast series of adventures encountered ' on the expedition . With an even vaster series of adventures , Poe may have intended to make his own travelogue still more exciting , but the effect of his method is to give his story an allegoric force it would lack if it were more plausible . Pym 's irresistible desire to know and his self-fulfilling visions of self-destruction have a significance that does not depend on the repeated horrors of the story . When the novel was published in 1838 , the narrative was preceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr Poe ' had presented a version of the early adventures of Pym , under the garb of fiction ' in the Southern Literary Messenger in the previous year . In fact , the Messenger had carried only two instalments of the narrative when Poe left the magazine and the serialization stopped . According to Pym 's ' preface to the novel , the readers of the Messenger had insisted on treating the fictional ' version as the truth and had thus encouraged him to publish his story in his own words , knowing that he had little to fear on the score of popular incredulity ' . This double bluff or variation on the theme of fiction and credulity was developed in an end-note to the narrative in which the late sudden and distressing death of Mr Pym ' is given as the cause for the loss of the final chapters . Pym survived his plunge into the Symmesian gulf to return to the States and tell his story to Mr Poe ' , but , so the anonymous writer of the note tells us , the few remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perished . Mr Poe ' declined the task of completing the story , since he disbelieved the entire truth of the latter portions of the narration ' , according to the writer of the note , who thus shows himself to be more credulous than Mr Poe ' . More credulous and , by his own account , more perceptive , for he offers an interpretation of the hieroglyphics in the chasms of Tsalal that escaped the attention of Mr Poe ' . But if the knowledge  | towards which Pym 's quest was directed is provided in an anonymous postscript to the narrative , unauthorized by Mr Poe ' or Pym , that knowledge itself is hardly conclusive , for it turns out to be no more than a possible connection between an Ethiopian verbal root meaning to be shady ' , an Egyptian word meaning the region of the south ' , the fact ' that the natives of Tsalal knew nothing of the colour white and were terrified of it , and an Arabic verbal root meaning to be white ' . Thus an end-note to a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfidy and butchery tempts its readers to interpret it as a fable of black insurrection in the Southern States to whose peculiar institution ' its author ? as we know from external evidence ? gave his sympathies . Edgar Allan Poe the man approved of slavery and detested Northern abolitionists , but The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym is a work whose narrative technique makes definite interpretation a hoax the reader practises on himself . If reading Poe 's novel is problematic because of the profligacy of its horrors and the sheer quantity of its adventures , his two related sea tales offer superb examples of narrative economy . MS Found in a Bottle ' is one of Poe 's earliest tales ? it was first published in 1833 ? and one of his best . Here the quest theme is so explicit that the sceptical , unsuperstitious , materialistic narrator finds himself unconsciously daubing the word DISCOVERY ' on a sail that lies near him on the mystery ship that destroyed the prosaic vessel in which he had sailed . Horror and astonishment give way to feelings for which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the region of the sublime where conceptions are indefinite ' and where a new sense ? a new entity ' is added to the soul . Combining Symmes 's theories of holes at the poles with the legend of the Flying Dutchman , Poe 's story takes his narrator out of the world of clock-time by first enveloping him in eternal night and then casting him on a ship that is lost in aeons of time . The immensely aged captain , a hoary and awe-inspiring figure who combines Coleridge 's Ancient Mariner with suggestions of Columbus , steers by antique and mouldering scientific instruments , his cabin littered with obsolete and longforgotten charts ' . On deck are strewn mathematical instruments that are also obsolete , for all human measurements and all human knowledge have lost their relevance on this quest voyage on the oceans of eternity . As the ship is swept southwards through stupendous ramparts of ice towards a gigantic whirlpool , the narrator 's horror is such that no reader can ? he presumes ? conceive it . But , in this archetypal Poesque narrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these awful regions ' even though his knowledge will involve his death . The  | knowledge to which he feels himself hurrying is some exciting knowledge ? some never-to-be imparted secret , whose attainment is destruction ' . Like all Poe 's questing narrators , he welcomes his own annihilation , but the literary record he leaves behind him can take its readers only to the brink of the precipice , the edge of the whirlpool , for beyond that lies the ineffable . The words of the manuscript take us to the limits of language . There was to be one survivor , however , in A Descent into the Maelstrom ' ( 1841 ) . The inner narrator of this tale is atypical in that he did not seek confrontation with the ultimate mysteries and had no day-dreams of self-destruction . Caught in the maelstrom by a mere mechanical failure in measuring time ( his watch stopped ) , he experiences a crescendo of horrors as he nears the jaws of the gulf . Yet this narrator , too , loses his terror in a positive wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renounced all hope of self-preservation , for the vast power of the whirlpool becomes to him a wonderful ' manifestation of God 's power ' that makes his own life seem trivial . In this tale , release from the desire to save the self becomes the means of saving the self , for the practical reason is freed and can provide an escape by observation . The narrator is saved because he notices that cylindrical objects are most resistant to the pull of the vortex and therefore leaves the apparent safety of his boat for the flimsier protection of a mere cask . Later he learns the law ' that explains this phenomenon and his escape . Poe helpfully supplies a learned reference to Archimedes ' work De Incidentibus in Fluido ' , but the reference is fictional , it does not ? as it seems to do ? validate the narrator 's marvellous escape in terms of an extra-fictional authority . Thus there is an element of hoax in the explanation ' of the escape . The tale is an unqualified success , its effect ' is perfectly achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has almost seen God 's face and lived is limited by the fact that he descended only half the distance between the surface and the bottom of the gulf . Thus he came close enough to the awful and destructive power he names God for the experience to turn his hair white , but remaining in the realm of reason , and narrative , he could not reach the ineffable depth that is itself an annihilation of language . In some of his most successful tales of the 1840s Poe returns to the theme of the self-destructive impulse that had sent Arthur Gordon Pym on his travels , but in these later fictions uses the structure of the murder story . In The Imp of the Perverse ' ( 1845 ) a rather perfunctory confession of murder is appended to an essay on the psychological forces that make men seek their own destruction . Delivered as part of the narrator 's  | account of his own experience , this essay on the spirit of perversity acts as a summary of many of Poe 's fictional situations , for it vividly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through states of horror to reach a condition in which he acutely desires to plunge to annihilation . Rejecting any attempt to explain such a radical , primitive impulse ' in terms of the current theories of phrenology or in terms of any rational theory , Poe 's narrator uses the analogy of the Arabian Nights genie to suggest the demonic force at work here : the genie is , then , the imp ' . But to talk of imps or genies is to explain nothing , and the point is made implicitly in the paragraph that rejects any motive . The impulse that impells us contains the imp ' in it ! The lexical play contains no rationale ; it merely shows that there is a devil in the language . The Black Cat ' ( 1843 ) is one of the rare Poe tales in which the setting is a normal house , inhabited by a once happily married couple , rather than a decaying castle owned by a hypochondriac recluse whose sanity is in doubt . But the normal relationship between narrator and wife ended long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale is the Fiend Intemperance that turned the gentle , affectionate narrator into a cruel , murderous demon . With its spirit of perversity conventionalized as the spirits in the bottle ( of gin ) , this tale is even trite in its motivation until it is redeemed , as Metzengerstein ' had been , by the totemic force of an animal : here the black cat that gives a vivid embodiment to the narrator 's guilt . The murder of his loving wife while he is in a demoniacal rage moves the narrator less than his subjection to a diabolical reincarnation of a cat he has tortured and killed . Both killings , however , plainly serve the need to destroy himself that informs the narrator-murderer 's subsequent actions . In Poe the murderer-victim relationship is frequently complicated by suggestions that the murderer identifies with the victim ; that the agent projects himself into the situation of his victim and thus inflicts his cruelties on himself . In The Tell-Tale Heart ' , another tale first published in 1843 , the murderer 's heart and that of his victim beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination ? as both listen to the ticking ( of the deathwatch beetles ) in the wall . At once a sensational tale of utmost terror and an allegory of man 's subjection to time , this tale illustrates the difficulty of categorizing Poe 's fictions . Cruelty , as we have seen , is an ingredient of some of Poe 's humorous tales , even if neutralized by absurdities like those of The Scythe of Time ' . Even the trivial anecdote Why the Little Frenchman Wears His Hand in a Sling ' ( 1837 ? 9 ) depends for its point on the physical cruelty , as well as the verbal battery , that Sir Pathrick O'Grandison offers to the  | little Mounseer Frog . Equally crude in its verbal fun and equally dependent on physical cruelty for its anecdotal point is the extravaganza Never Bet the Devil Your Head ' ( 1841 ) , but a more interesting tale of physical dismemberment is The Man That Was Used Up ' ( 1839 ) , for this grotesque story touches on many of Poe 's perennial concerns . Brevet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkably fine-looking man whose magnificent physique and military reputation combine to dazzle the naive narrator of the tale until he visits the General in his dressing-room and finds the real man to be no more than a trunk , whose every limb and organ has had to be artificially supplied to make good the depredations of the Bugaboo and Kickapoo Indians he fought . The point of this unsubtly ironic tale is that , before the revelation , the General has waxed eloquent on the wonders of the age , its railways , steamboats , and other truly useful mechanical contrivances ' . General Smith expressed a confidence and a pride that was shared by millions of Americans when he boasted of the technological wonders of the age . In doing so , he identified progress ' ? one of the sacred words of the period ? with material progress . When Poe reduces this fine figure of a man to a mere bundle lying helpless on the floor of its room , he expresses his contempt for what he considers a callow and unworthy conception of human development . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of the age ' as that was expressed by faith in progress . Some Words with a Mummy ' ( 1845 ) ridicules American pride in such achievements as the Bowling-Green Fountain in New York and the Capitol at Washington , DC , by contrasting them with the glories of ancient Egypt . Every invention of which the nineteenth century is proud was , so the revivified ancient Egyptian claims , anticipated by his civilization , while the Great Movement or Progress ' that the Transcendentalist Dial magazine supposedly advocates is dismissed by the Egyptian with a reference to the nuisance such movements caused in his day , though they never progressed . American pride in democracy recalls , to the ancient Egyptian , the bragging of thirteen Egyptian provinces that boasted prodigiously of their democratic political system and instituted the intolerable despotism of Mob . Almost the same point is made in Mellonta Tauta ' ( 1849 ) , when the wise man of the year 2848 looks back on the absurdities of the ancient Amriccan ' notions of democratic rule , rating it no higher than a community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Una ' ( 1841 ) the tone is solemn , for Monos speaks with the wisdom of one who has passed beyond earthly life , and the verdict on nineteenth-century confidence in the advances of  | practical science is unambiguous . Looking down and back on the era of belief in the progress of civilization , Monos states that the supposed improvements brought about by science were actually part of a backward movement , a retrogradation in the true utility ' , though only the poets were able to perceive this truth . In those days , when utilitarian philosophy dominated , only the poetic intellect was able to grasp the meaning of the mystic parable ' of the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge and to realize that man 's soul was not yet ready for knowledge . The fruits of the forbidden tree are , of course , death . Monos 's colloquy tells of the apocalyptic end of the world . In the era of imagined progress , the knowledge on which men prided themselves was their power over nature , yet this produced the hideous ugliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taste . Taste , as we know from The Poetic Principle ' , was the poetic faculty and concerned itself with the beautiful . In The Colloquy ' , as in his Sonnet ? To Science ' , the scientific and the poetic world-views are antipathetic , and to the former belongs the idea of egalitarian democracy as well as confidence in progress . In a review of poetical works by Joseph Rodman Drake and FitzGreene Halleck , written in 1836 , Poe stated that poetry had never been defined adequately and perhaps never could be , yet he went on to offer his suggestions for a definition : If , indeed , there be any one circle of thought distinctly and palpably marked out from amid the jarring and tumultuous chaos of human intelligence , it is that evergreen and radiant Paradise which the true poet knows , and knows alone , as the limited realm of his authority ? as the circumscribed Eden of his dreams . Earlier , while discussing The Fall of the House of Usher ' , we noted Poe 's belief that music gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Putting these two statements beside Poe 's assertion , in The Poetic Principle ' , that poetry and music seek the Beauty above ' when the artist is inspired ' by an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave ' , we can see that he consistently defines the realm of poetry in terms of its distance and difference from the waking world of everyday life . The association of the realm of the poem with the realm of the dream is unmistakable in Poe 's thought , from the two poems on dreams in his 1827 volume of verse to the end of his career . In his penetrating essay , The House of Poe ' , Richard Wilbur has argued that the motifs of enclosure or circumscription ' ( Wilbur 's italics ) that recur in tale after tale suggest the exclusion of the outer or real ' world and the  | isolation of the poetic soul in revery , or dream-waking ' as Poe called it . ' Taking Poe 's fundamental plot to be the effort of the poetic soul to escape from consciousness into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict between the poetic soul and the earthly self to which it is bound ( and , by extension , the actual world in which that self must live ) , Wilbur considers The Fall of the House of Usher ' the archetypal Poe story . This is a helpful comment in that it enables us to take the tale very seriously indeed , though we may not want to agree with Wilbur that Usher ' is not really a horror story but , rather , a triumphant report by the narrator that the poetic soul can shake off the real world and escape to the realm of unfettered vision . Such a reading rewrites the story , changing horror and collapse into putative elevation . Similarly , interpretations of the destruction in Poe 's fictions as a stage in the progress from the discordant life of the actual world to an ideal unity that lies beyond the fragmented self , take us beyond the actual fictions . In Eureka : An Essay on the Material and Spiritual Universe ( 1848 ) Poe announced the great truth that all things and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unity ' and that all aspirations towards perfection were struggles toward the original Unity ' , but to read the tales in the retroactive light of his last great prose poem is to distort the fictions . In Eureka ' , the return to absolute unity from which everything was evoked by the will of God is a subsidence into nothingness that will be followed by a swelling into a new existence as the centripetal and centrifugal movements of the Heart Divine ' prove to be the movements of our own hearts . In the tales , by contrast , Poe 's language can only take us through the process , or rather to the edge , of the subsidence into nothingness . In the Idealism ' chapter of Nature , Emerson quoted lines from The Tempest to illustrate the poet 's power to work a transfiguration ' of material objects . The lines selected show Prospero 's use of music to cure Alonzo and his companions of their frenzy and restore them to reason . Emerson commented : The perception of real affinities between events ( that is to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , enables the poet thus to make free with the most imposing forms and phenomena of the world , and to assert the predominance of the soul . ' Prospero , Emerson 's archetypal poet here , can control the world of matter through his imaginative power to transfigure ' the world of phenomena . In one of Poe 's most effective tales , The Masque of the Red Death ' ( 1842 ) , a prince who is given the name of Prospero encloses himself and a thousand chosen guests in a castellated abbey to keep its inhabitants uncontaminated by the cholera that is raging throughout his kingdom .  | Sealing all the gates to prevent any intrusion or any escape , he confines his guests in a world that is entirely dominated by his fancy . Everything in the confined world of the abbey is a product of Prospero 's imagination , from the colours of the seven rooms , to the colour of the great clock that , like the most westerly room in which it stands , is deep black . While the pestilence ravages the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prince has provided for a masked ball that he has commanded . They stop only when the clock strikes the hours and momentarily interrupts their frenetic movement . The masked figures , like the people of Merry Mount in Hawthorne 's story ( to be discussed in Chapter 5 ) , are dreams ' . They writhe ' to the prince 's music , for they are products of his imagination . But , for all Prospero 's despotic power in his micro-kingdom , the plague enters the abbey and appears at the ball in the mask.of death . When the enraged prince attacks the intruder in the ultimate , black room , he dies . His death is quickly followed by the death of all his dream-figures . The end of the tale is apocalyptic : And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all ' . As Richard Wilbur has argued , this tale can be interpreted as an allegory of the relationship between the circumscribed world of the poet 's imaginative control and the pestilential reality beyond it . The contrast between Poe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art than any disagreement concerning the status of metre in poetry .

The inhabitants of the town were chiefly traders , shipwrights , and sailors ; and since no anchor could be weighed , no sail unfurled , no vessel so much as launched from the stocks , their cheerful industry was at an end . No more are they to lay the keel of the fleet merchantman , or shape the rib symmetrically for its frame , or strengthen the graceful hull by knees of oak , or rig the well proportioned masts , or bend the sails to the yards . The king of that country has changed the busy workshops into scenes of compulsory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , with the keenest eye for forms of beauty and speed , are forced by act of parliament to fold their hands . Want scowled on the laborer , as he sat with his wife and children at his board . The sailor roamed the streets listlessly without hope of employment . The law was executed with a rigor that went beyond the intentions of its authors . Not a scow could be manned by oars to bring an ox , or a sheep , or a bundle of hay from the islands . All water carriage from pier to pier , though but of lumber , or bricks , or lime , was strictly forbidden . The boats between Boston and Charlestown could not ferry a parcel of goods across Charles River ; the fishermen of Marblehead , when from their hard pursuit , they bestowed quintals of dried fish on the poor of Boston , were obliged to transport their offering in wagons by a circuit of thirty miles . The warehouses of the thrifty merchants were at once made valueless ; the costly wharfs , which extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the produce of the tropics and with English fabrics , were become solitary places ; the harbor , which had resounded incessantly with the cheering voices of prosperous commerce , was now disturbed by no sounds but from British vessels of war .  | At Philadelphia , the bells of the churches were muffled and tolled ; the ships in port hoisted their colors at half mast ; and nine-tenths of the houses , except those of the Friends , were shut during the memorable First of June . In Virginia , the population thronged the churches ; Washington attended the service , and strictly kept the fast . No firmer or more touching words were addressed to the sufferers than from Norfolk , which was the largest place of trade in that well-watered and extensive dominion , ' and which , from its deep channel and nearness to the ocean , lay most exposed to ships of war . Our hearts are warmed with affection for you , ' such was its message ; we address the Almighty Ruler to support you in your afflictions . Be assured we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look upon ourselves as bound by the most sacred ties to support you . ' Jefferson , from the foot of the Blue Ridge of the Alleghanies , condemned the act of parliament , which in a moment reduced an ancient and wealthy town from opulence to want , and without a hearing and without discrimination , sacrificed property of the value of millions to revenge ? not repay ? the loss of a few thousands . If the pulse of the people beat calmly under such an experiment by the new and till now unheard of executive power of a British parliament , ' said the young statesman , another and another will be tried , till the measure of despotism be filled up . ' The History of the United States ( 1858 ) The clocks in the Boston belfries strike twelve as this passage opens , and in doing so they announce more than the beginning of the British blockade of Boston harbour in June 1774 . They also mark a stage in the inexorable movement towards American independence that George Bancroft 's history dramatizes . Like many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend a fateful emphasis to the events is too blatant to be completely effective , though it does add a flourish to the opening sentence as it comes to its portentous close : the blockade of the harbor began ' . Hutchinson , the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony , is leaving to carry back to England reports of the colonials ' insubordination , so his departure bodes nothing but ill for the people of Massachusetts . They are described as mainly people who make their living from the sea , as sailors , as skilled craftsmen ( shipwrights ) or as traders . We are thus shown three distinct categories of employment and ? by normal reckoning ? at least two social classes , but Bancroft 's technique  | here is to stress their common interests and to disregard any potential or actual social divisions among his Bostonians . All share a cheerful industry ' , whether they are engaged in the manual work of weighing anchor , unfurling sails , launching the vessels , or in the provision of capital that makes possible the laying down of ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attention then focuses on the physical activities involved in shipbuilding and in sailing . The sentence that evokes the typical work of the shipwrights and sailors is stylized and rhythmic . Laying the keel , shaping the rib , strengthening the hull , rigging the masts , bending the sails , are of course activities that occur at differing stages of the life of the vessel , so that the sentence takes us on a journey in time through the progress of the work , and the verbs of action combine to give an impression of unceasing effort . But it is not just hard work that is being celebrated here , for the nouns are augmented by adjectives that stress the skill and the expertise of the industrious craftsmen and sailors of Boston : the merchantmen are fleet ' , the rib is shaped symetrically ' , the hull is graceful ' and the mast is well-proportioned ' . In this brief passage , then , the industry of the mechanics is more than reported , it is sung ' in a way that is not dissimilar to that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first edition of Leaves of Grass three years before this volume of Bancroft 's History of the United States was published . The men of Boston , we must suppose , do not labour unwillingly or grudgingly ; their cheerful industry ' is such that the harbour resounds with their cheering voices ' until they are forced into idleness . Bancroft takes such trouble to make vivid the happy productivity of the port of Boston before 1 June 1774 , because it is essential to his purpose here and throughout his History to establish a contrast between the values of the colonists and the values of the British monarchy and parliament . Together the latter have converted busy workshops into scenes of enforced inactivity . In Bancroft 's prose the blockaded harbour is an image of idleness and want , with the moral guilt for these evils belonging , not to the American men who are workless , but to their British rulers who have robbed them of their legitimate occupations . The injustice is made more outrageous when we are told , with characteristic Bancroftian superlatives , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keenest eye ' for beauty and speed . The merchants , too , are thrifty , and their commerce is prosperous . To complement the passage on the skills of the craftsmen we have a glowing image of costly wharfs . . . covered with the produce of the tropics and with English fabrics ' before English tyranny empties them  | and turns the noisy , bustling , happy commercial activity to silence . British belligerence , given concrete form in the vessels of war that keep the merchantmen idly imprisoned in the port , converts riches into poverty , takes from skilled artisans the opportunity to use their talents , and ? to cover the whole social spectrum implied in the passage ? adds unnecessarily to the already severe labours of the fishermen of Marblehead by making them bring their fish to Boston by a circuitous land route . Typically , in Bancroft 's prose the fishermen do nothing as banal , if worthy , as give away their fish . Instead they bestow ' on the poor of Boston the offerings ' wrung from the sea by their efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dignity and solemnity of this act of charity and this example of American solidarity . Having established his contrast between British militarism and Bostonian industriousness , and having dramatized the conflict between cheerful vitality and sombre , potentially deadly tyranny , in the next paragraph Bancroft sets out to establish the idea that the colonies were united in their resistance to British repression . Though Massachusetts was destined to play a leading role in the drama , as all his readers already knew , Bancroft wants to show that the spirit of independence was not limited to the Bay State but was shared by colonies as distant and diverse as Pennsylvania and Virginia . Writing when sectional rivalry and animosity was embittering the national life , the historian plainly intends to show that , at the time of the heroic struggle for independence from England , North and South were united in their opposition to the common enemy . They were united , too , in their piety : the first of June being a Fast Day , in Puritan Massachusetts and episcopalian Virginia the churches are well attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminder that that town , like Boston , is a trading centre and depends for its life on sea-borne commerce , draws the links tighter with its expression of sympathy . The religious language in which that message is phrased , calling on the Almighty for support and referring to sacred ties ' , lets the reader know that the colonists were aware of the Providential nature of American history . By presenting the message from Norfolk in direct speech , Bancroft gives immediacy to his story and continues the dramatization begun in the first paragraph when the desolation of the harbour was vividly evoked . His purpose , clearly , is to make the events and the men who took part in them come alive in his prose ; the scholarship on which the narrative is founded is not allowed to come between the reader and emotional involvement in the story . Thus the Norfolk message is not assigned to a particular source but has to be taken as speaking for the  | whole town and , indeed , for all the people of the Old Dominion . Next we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hero whose name stands at the beginning of the paragraph and picks up the theme announced when George Washington 's name was introduced . The great men of the revolutionary period are kept in sight throughout the history . Merely to note that Washington , already a figure of mythic stature in 1858 , attended the Fast Day service on the momentous first of June is to remind us that his role in the coming events was to be decisive . Jefferson , only a young statesman in 1774 , speaks tellingly on the main theme , which he defines as a struggle between despotism and the spirit of independence . This passage is taken from the seventh volume ( 1858 ) of what was to become a ten-volume history of the United States . In his first volume , which appeared in 1834 , Bancroft had introduced and developed the essential themes , one of whose climaxes lies in the story of the blockade of Boston harbour , for the story of Boston is the story of the New England Puritans and had a symbolic value for Bancroft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the revolutionary generation , we can best explore Bancroft 's methods and his meanings by examining the significance he gives to the New England capital in the eighteenth century . In the sixth volume of the History , which was published in 1854 , Bancroft had dealt with a crisis that occurred between October and December 1768 . In the chapter called The King and the British Parliament against the Town of Boston ' ( ch. 38 ) , vocabulary , style and tone combine to make the issue clear-cut : The King set himself , and his Ministry , and Parliament , and all Great Britain , to subdue to his will one stubborn little town on the sterile coast of the Massachusetts Bay . The odds against it were fearful ; but it showed a life inextinguishable , and had been chosen to keep guard over the liberties of mankind ' ( p. 240 ) . The cause for which the town is fighting is dignified and the behaviour of its people made to appear unselfish , disinterested and altruistic when we are told that the liberties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town ' has been chosen ' by what can only be Divine Providence to defend the cause of human freedom and the progress that depends upon that freedom , the contest is not the unequal affair that Bancroft 's emotive language at first seems to make it . Boston , representing all New England , is here God 's chosen instrument , just as the Bay State had been in the Puritan histories , though when Bancroft details its virtues he selects political , not religious , institutions for praise . In elevated language appropriate to the theme , he  | tells us that the old world had not its parallel ' in political equality . The source of all municipal authority was the Town Meeting , attended by the great body ' of its male inhabitants over the age of twenty , where taxes were voted , affairs discussed and decided , and abstract political principles debated in freedom . Since all the children attended good public schools , this political participation was genuinely open to the people as a whole , for good education was the basis of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims that the town of Boston came closer to being a pure democracy ' than any municipality of comparable size ever had . Bancroft 's homage to the citizens of eighteenth-century Boston reveals more about his values than any abstract statement could . He praises them for their intellectual curiosity in the natural sciences as well as in political thought . To avoid any suggestion of anarchic radicalism on their part , they are credited with practical judgment ' ( p. 242 ) . What might have become a realistic admission of their weaknesses is converted by Bancroft 's prose into a strength , when the calculating shrewdness ' and fondness for gain ' of these Yankees are presented as expressions of their adventurous spirit . Hard bargains must be made at someone 's expense , but even when he admits their avidity ' Bancroft adds that it was tempered by a well-considered and continuing liberality ' . In fact , Bancroft 's Bostonians are his archetypal Americans , for nearly every man was struggling to make his own way in the world and his own fortune ' ( p. 242 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not allowed to make them selfish : individually and as a body they were public-spirited ' . In Bancroft 's account of Boston society there are three main divisions ? ministers , merchants and mechanics ? but all are united in their bold speculation on political matters . The evolution of their theory of an independent representative commonwealth is attributed to their powers of analysis and is supposed to have happened spontaneously , without conscious intent . In one of the rhetorical flourishes that shows how close Bancroft 's prose style in the History could come to the style of public oratory , he concludes : While the earth was still wrapt in gloom , they welcomed the daybreak of popular freedom , and like the young eagle in his upward soarings , looked undazzled into the beams of the morning ' ( p. 243 ) . But if they are heroically turned towards the rising sun of liberty for the people , the Bostonians have been providentially chosen because of their Puritan past . In 1834 , the year in which the first volume of Bancroft 's History was published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | million by Bancroft 's calculation , so that one third of the white population of the United States could consider the seventeenth-century emigrants their parents ' ( p. 468 ) . Discussing the origins of Puritanism in England , Bancroft identifies that faith with belief in democracy . Under Henry VIII , the issue was , we are told , popular sovereignty ' ( p. 462 ) . The Reformation in England was one manifestation of the awakening intelligence of a great nation ' that could not be terrified into submission and passivity by the brutal authority of the King . Under Elizabeth , the Puritan clergy became tribunes of the people ' and their pulpits were used to encourage free discussion ( p. 284 ) , so that to them alone can go the credit for tending the flame of liberty . As Bancroft interprets the spirit of the Protestant Reformation , religious and political impulses are fused : The enfranchisement of the mind from religious despotism led directly to inquiries into the nature of civil government ; and the doctrines of popular liberty , which sheltered their infancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short space of two centuries , have infused themselves into the life-blood of every rising state . ( p. 267 ) Here he is talking specifically of New England 's role as the guardian and subsequently the disseminator of the spirit of liberty , but when ( in a later volume ) he traces the impulse that caused the Reformation back to Augustine , Bancroft defines that impulse as one of independence from all earthly rulers and obedience only to God . The truths that would renew humanity ' are rescued from an age of collapse and decay by Augustine , and handed down by generations of monks who remain insulated from the corruption of society , until they help to free mankind from the caste system of the Middle Ages by encouraging the spirit of individuality ( iv . 151 ? 2 ) . In contradistinction to Channing , Bancroft claims that Calvinism brought with it , as well as intelligence and severity of morals , love of freedom ' ( vi . 192 ) . The Protestant Reformation as a whole was the work of men who reverenced and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calvin is Bancroft 's hero because unlike Martin Luther he can be treated as a social revolutionary . In making the seventeenth-century New England Puritans champions of popular liberty ? political and religious ? Bancroft is making them nineteenth-century democrats or , more specifically , Jacksonian Democrats . Those men and women who left England in the 1620s to settle in Massachusetts and subsequently in Connecticut for reasons of conscience did so to escape the intolerable authority of the established  | church in the home country , but they had no intention of allowing religious freedom in New England . Rather they were determined to establish the rule of the Godly , as they understood godliness . By their example they hoped , to be sure , to redeem the corrupted faith of England and of Europe , but tolerance in matters of such vital importance as religious faith was not to them a virtue . When in the first volume of the History he deals with the Puritan persecution of the Quakers in the 1650s , Bancroft does not condone their cruelty , for the Quakers expressed the human aspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and superstition ' ( p. 451 ) much more obviously than did their persecutors . Nevertheless , by stressing the suicidal impulse of the Quakers for martyrdom , Bancroft does his utmost to make his readers understand the Puritans ' behaviour . In any event , freedom is not the only American cause that Bancroft traces back to the Puritan parents ' . Describing the arrival of about a hundred of Endicott 's party at Salem in the Great Migration of 1628 , he stresses the melancholy scene where nature was completely wild and untamed . He has already detailed the sufferings of the Pilgrims who landed on the inhospitable shores of Cape Cod in November 1620 and faced the first terrible winter at Plymouth , so his readers know what miseries the new arrivals will have to endure , but he adds a key phrase when he says that the spirit of enterprise ' triumphed over any fears and doubts they may have felt . The life-giving spirit ' of Puritanism brought with it , so Bancroft argues , as well as courage and intelligence , activity ' and thrift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsumed under that enterprise ' exemplified by Endicott 's followers . Though enterprise is consistently associated with the Puritans in the History , it does not belong exclusively to them . The opening sentence of the first volume tells us that the enterprise of Columbus , the most memorable maritime enterprise in the history of the world , formed between Europe and America the communication which will never cease ' . A few pages later , the achievement of Columbus is attributed to an enterprise that seemed more divine than human ' ( p. 8 ) . The first of the great heroes of Bancroft 's history is credited with a deep religious enthusiasm and a disinterested magnanimity , and the term enterprise ' is thus established as the highest accolade . The term is conspicuously absent in Bancroft 's account of the exploits of the chivalrous Spaniards in America . They are credited with great daring and courage , but their motive is ferocious greed . De Soto 's expedition to Florida in 1539 is no more than a roving expedition of gallant freebooters ' in quest of fortune . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his men are made ferocious by their avarice ' , for even the Spanish religious zeal to convert savages is strangely mixed with the passions of avarice ' ( I. 30 ) . The Spaniards ' dream is of gold , of immense riches to be won by robbing and pillaging the indigenous people of the countries they invade ; they have no respect for hard and systematic work of the kind that the Puritans were to devote themselves to . Before the Puritans , only Captain John Smith , the hero of the story of Virginia , shows the foresight to realize that the future of the colony lies in ' regular industry ' rather than in gold , but we have to wait for the coming of the ' frugal and industrious race ' ( Iv . 149 ) that peopled Massachusetts before we can observe the true working of the spirit of enterprise . Returning to the theme of Columbus 's great enterprise in the fourth volume of the History , Bancroft states that his motive was ' to bring together the ends of the earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. 8 ) . It was for this purpose that God gave Columbus ' the keys that unlock the barriers of the ocean ' . In this last phrase Bancroft is adapting a quotation from a letter written by the explorer himself , but the sentiment is entirely in keeping with the tone in which Bancroft writes of the trade that will develop from the discovery of America . In his belief that commercial activity between nations and the voyaging it entailed not only encouraged friendship but was itself an expression of human brotherhood , Bancroft anticipated Walt Whitman 's ' Passage to India ' ( 1871 ) . Assuming the most elevated of his styles , the historian explains the spirit of commerce : From the dawn of social being , there has appeared a tendency towards commerce and intercourse between the scattered inhabitants of the earth . That mankind have ever earnestly desired this connection , appears from their willing homage to the adventurers and to every people , who have greatly enlarged the boundaries of the world , as known to civilization . ( p. 6 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections between people , Bancroft removes from it any suggestion of rivalry , competition or even profit-making . The prosaic and not necessarily ennobling business of buying and selling is here transformed into an abstract ideal . Appropriately , the passage on Columbus 's motives leads to a statement of Bancroft 's belief in the law of human progress in which he draws on Immanuel Kant 's theory of history : mankind strives for perfection and never reaches the bounds of its capacity for improvement in Bancroft 's version of Kant , but it is the ' reason of the whole '  | rather than the individual soul that makes progress ( p. 8 ) , and commerce is a means of its advancement . Here , as elsewhere in Bancroft 's works , Channing 's perfectionism is combined with a belief in the people ' or the whole ' that is much greater than Channing 's . Commerce , of course , means corporations and companies when on a scale that involves the crossing of oceans . In the progress of humanity from medieval oppression to modern freedom , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the commercial and manufacturing interests ' in their struggle against the militaristic aristocracy ( Ii . 261 ) . But Bancroft is against privilege in commerce as in social life , and argues that the true spirit of enterprise was inhibited by the sort of charter granted to John Cabot , with its monopolistic restriction of trade . Only when the principle of the joint-stock company was applied to navigation could that spirit triumph . Valuing trade as a vehicle of progress and regarding freedom as the ultimate good as Bancroft does , it is inevitable that he writes as the champion of free trade . Colonial resistance to British rule was , as he tells the story , occasioned by the British restriction of colonial trade in the Navigation Acts , and in rejecting the British mercantalist policy Bancroft 's patriots are portrayed as idealists defending principles of freedom rather than businessmen protecting their profits . Writing of George Grenville 's enthusiasm for the Navigation Acts as the palladium of his country 's greatness ' , Bancroft steps in to correct ' the opinion he has recorded and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to its pre-eminence in freedom . Freedom and enterprise ' together bring temporary greatness to Holland ( i. 216 ) , another Protestant nation whose struggle against tyranny earns Bancroft 's respect . But though the Dutch are on the side of progress against the retrograde forces of Catholic Spain , their example will have less consequence for the course of world history than that of Bancroft 's America . At the end of the sixth volume of the History , the intrepid , hardy and industrious population ' of America is seen moving irresistibly westward through the Allegheny Mountains towards the immensely distant Pacific Ocean . The spirit of that people is made vivid in words culled ? as the footnote says ? from letters written in February 1774 , though no specific source is given . Confident that the progress of their nation in the next hundred years will exceed the utmost stretch of their imagination , the westward-moving people foresee as part of the glory of this New World ' a vast growth of trade : A commerce will and must arise , independent of every thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , or of which a European can have an adequate idea ' ( p. 506 ) .  | According to Harvey Wish , in concentrating his interest on heroes , political action and the drama of public events , Bancroft neglects economic factors . ' Certainly Bancroft shows remarkably little awareness of the complexity of economic forces at work within nations , but , as David Levin has pointed out , ' Bancroft saw something of the connection between Protestantism and capitalism that Weber and Tawney were later to demonstrate . Like his contemporaries W. H. Prescott and J. L. Motley , Bancroft 's treatment of that connection served to elevate the economic motive rather than lower the religious one , as Levin helpfully puts it . The elevation ' is achieved , as we have seen , by subsuming economic and religious motives under the general category of the tendency towards freedom and progress . The process involves a reliance on general concepts or abstract ideas for which Bancroft was indebted to German philosophy , and it is time to turn to the influence of Germany on Bancroft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a family less eminent than William Ellery Channing 's but one that had a long history in New England . The first Bancroft to come to Massachusetts had arrived in 1632 , but most of his descendants had remained humble farmers . George Bancroft 's father had worked his way up to become minister of the Old South Church at Worcester , Massachusetts , and had sent his son to Harvard College to train for the ministry . As an unusually promising young student , Bancroft was sent to Germany for advanced study in the classics and in theology after completing his undergraduate study in 1817 and spending one postgraduate year at Harvard . By this time it was already becoming de rigueur at Harvard to send outstanding young scholars to Germany ; George Ticknor , who was to become the first Professor of Modern Languages , and Edward Everett , future President of Harvard , had preceded Bancroft . The choice of German rather than British universities was both a tribute to the high reputation of German scholarship and an indication of the new American resolve to escape from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for Gottingen , Bancroft was warned by his mentors at Harvard against dangerous tendencies towards unorthodoxy in German theological studies , but on his return he was still sufficiently orthodox to prepare himself for the Church and to preach in his father 's pulpit . At Gottingen Bancroft heard Eichhorn lecture on theology and from him learned of the new scientific ' biblical criticism that was  | bringing linguistic and historical skills to bear on scriptural texts . Moving on to Berlin , Bancroft became a friend of the great theologian Schleiermacher , whose ideas on the relationship between God and man anticipated Channing 's and , according to Henry A. Pochmann , influenced the Unitarian . ' But Bancroft did not only study theology in his German years . Arnold Heeren taught history at Gottingen and taught Bancroft the need for a philosophy of universal history ' , though he failed to impart to his American pupil an adequate understanding of the economic interpretation of history that he was pioneering . ' In Berlin , Bancroft may have heard Hegel lecture and he would certainly have found the philosopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hegel 's Philosophy of History expounds his theory of a universal history in which the past tells the story of the inevitable progress of the consciousness of freedom . The usefulness of such ideas to Bancroft is obvious , yet in his works he refers not to Hegel but ( as we have seen ) to Kant , or to Herder , Fichte and Heeren . The most impressive exposition of the belief in the natural ( organic ) progress of the people ( the Volk ) was to be found in Herder 's four-volume Ideas for the Philosophy of History ( 1784-91 ) . There can be no doubt of Bancroft 's debt to this philosopher of history , since he wrote on Herder in the years after his return from Germany in 1822 . A succession of essays and reviews dealing with German thought in the North American Review and the American Quarterly Review were Bancroft 's contribution to the growth of American interest in German philosophical idealism , though they clearly had less impact than Thomas Carlyle 's propagandizing essays on German culture . Even more obviously than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how easily American men of letters in the first half of the nineteenth century moved from one discipline ' , as we would now call it , to another . Before he wrote the first volume of his History , he had published a volume of verse ( in 1823 ) and had established a reputation as a critic and scholar with his essays on German literature . Clearly sharing Channing 's view that literature was nothing less than the expression of a nation 's mind in writing ' , Bancroft recognized no academic boundary-line between philosophy and poetry ; he wrote as confidently on Herder as he did on Mrs Felicia Hemans 's verse . Because of his interest in German idealism and his familiarity with Kant 's writings , Bancroft is sometimes associated with the Transcendental movement in New England . ' Without doubt , Bancroft anticipated Emerson in his interest in German Romantic philosophy , in his belief in the divine potentiality of human nature , and in his belief in  | moral laws that could be intuitively perceived . Indisputable , too , is Bancroft 's personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to be ? however variously ? linked with the New Light philosophy in New England : George Ripley , James Freeman Clarke , John Sullivan Dwight and Margaret Fuller . However , Bancroft is to be distinguished from all of these by his active and continuous engagement in American political life after 1834 , and particularly by his close involvement with Democratic Party politics . According to Arthur Schlesinger , Jr , it was the writing of the History that released Bancroft 's sympathies with Jacksonian democracy . ' By 1836 Bancroft was an important figure in Massachusetts Democratic politics ; in 1838 he was given a political appointment as Collector for Boston , losing that position when the Whig victory of 1840 ousted his party ; in the 1844 Democratic convention he helped to swing the vote to Polk and for the next year and a half became Secretary of the Navy in Polk 's presidential administration , before becoming acting Secretary of War in 1846 and subsequently Minister to England until 1849 . Under President Andrew Johnson , Bancroft was appointed Minister to Prussia in 1866 as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus Bancroft was at the centre of Democratic Party politics in the expansionist years and intimately involved with the war with Mexico that was to disgust the more delicate conscience of the more genuinely Transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau ( see below ) . Bancroft 's Spread-Eagleism ' involved him in no hypocrisy because his belief in human progress was inseparable from his belief in the People ' : a faith that , with him , took a less complex form than it had in the theory of his German mentor , Arnold Heeren . In his 1835 oration The Office of the People ' , Bancroft clearly had Channing 's famous sermon in mind when he wrote : If it be the duty of the individual to strive after perfection like the perfection of God , how much more ought a nation to be the image of Deity ' ( my emphasis ) . In speaking for the spirit in man ' rather than in the privileged few ' , Bancroft is faithful to the sense of Channing 's sermon as that was to be developed in the later lectures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ' rather than the cultivated individual is the best judge of taste , he was adapting the notion of culture to fit his populist leanings . When he goes on to say that individuals are but shadows . . . the race is immortal ' , Bancroft has moved very far indeed from Channing and from anything resembling Transcendentalism . The belief that the movement of the species is upward irresistibly ' is combined in Bancroft 's address with a readiness to accept the loss of the individual that would have seriously disturbed Emerson .  | Almost twenty years later , in an oration entitled The Progress of Mankind ' ( 1854 ) , Bancroft again borrowed from Channing in formulating his central idea that man is capable of progress because he can not separate himself from his inward experience and his yearning after the infinite ' , but here too the insistence that individuals , families , peoples , and the whole human race march in accord ' tends to devalue the individual soul even though the tune all march to is the Divine will ' . Bancroft 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his History as a vote for Jackson . Schlesinger ? a recent apologist for Jacksonian Democracy ? takes Bancroft 's theme to have been the struggle between capital and labour and sees the historian as the champion of the working man . ' But , as we have seen , Bancroft 's commitment to commercial development and the capitalist system on which his ideal free trade ' depended led him to blur any incipient class divisions in his conception of the American Volk . Brownson , as we shall see , had a much clearer vision of the divisive effects of the expanding factory-based economy of the 1830s and 1840s . Bancroft 's reputation as the father of American historians rests on the immense amount of original research he undertook in the course of his busy life , his prodigious labour in archives , his indefatigable work with source materials . His immense popularity with the reading public ( his first volume had reached its fifteenth edition by 1852 ) was due to his ability to infuse life into the historical characters he portrayed and to dramatize vividly the struggle that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rhetorical style that is likely to alienate modern readers , for the declamatory mode was one with which American readers were familiar from their well-loved orators . One of those orators , Edward Everett , had pointed out to Bancroft that the spine of his first edition , with its American eagle surrounded by a circle of thirteen stars , carried a misquotation ( ' Westward the star of empire takes its way ' ) , a corruption of Bishop Berkeley 's line on the course of empire ' . Yet the fifteenth American edition of Volume I still bore the eagle on its cover and the misquotation with it , as did the first edition of Volume X in 1874 . ( English editions tactfully had neither eagle nor slogan on the spine . ) The introduction to Volume I both celebrates American achievements ? justice , inventiveness , prosperity shared by all classes ? and projects a vision of the glorious American future as the course of progress continues : New states are forming in the wilderness ; canals , intersecting our plains and crossing our highlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along  | our watercourses ; the use of steam on our rivers and rail-roads annihilates distance by the acceleration of speed . ' Repeatedly , in the History , Bancroft contrasts the melancholy grandeur ' of the unimproved American wilderness with the harmonious beauty of the scene when improved ' by the abstract force of American ' enterprise ' . Other writers ? among them the historian Francis Parkman were soon to express a clearer vision of the material particularities of that enterprise and industry , and a more ambivalent response to the progress of the civilization that depended on it .

In the slight sketch here attempted , the facts , recorded on the grave pages of our New England annalists , have wrought themselves , almost spontaneously , into a sort of allegory . The masques , mummeries , and festive customs , described in the text , are in accordance with the manners of the age . Authority on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English Sports and Pastimes . Bright were the days at Merry Mount , when the May-Pole was the banner-staff of that gay colony ! They who reared it , should their banner be triumphant , were to pour sunshine over New England 's rugged hills , and scatter flower-seeds throughout the soil . Jollity and gloom were contending for an empire . Midsummer eve had come , bringing deep verdure to the forest , and roses in her lap , of a more vivid hue than the tender buds of Spring . But May , or her mirthful spirit ; dwelt all the year round at Merry Mount , sporting with the Summer months , and revelling with Autumn , and basking in the glow of Winter 's fireside . Through a world of toil and care , she flitted with a dreamlike smile , and came hither to find a home among the lightsome hearts of Merry Mount . Never had the May-Pole been so gaily decked as at sunset on midsummer eve . This venerated emblem was a pine tree , which had preserved the slender grace of youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood monarchs . From its top streamed a silken banner , colored like the rainbow . Down nearly to the ground , the pole was dressed with birchen boughs , and others of the liveliest green , and some with silvery leaves , fastened by ribbons that fluttered in fantastic knots of twenty different colors , but no sad ones . Garden flowers , and blossoms of the wilderness , laughed gladly forth amid the verdure , so fresh and dewy , that they must have grown by magic on that happy pine tree . Where this green and flowery splendor terminated , the shaft  | of the May-Pole was stained with the seven brilliant hues of the banner at its top . On the lowest green bough hung an abundant wreath of roses , some that had been gathered in the sunniest spots of the forest , and others , of still richer blush , which the colonists had reared from English seed . Oh , people of the Golden Age , the chief of your husbandry , was to raise flowers ! But what was the wild throng that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be , that the Fauns and Nymphs , when driven from their classic groves and homes of ancient fable , had sought refuge , as all the persecuted did , in the fresh woods of the West . These were Gothic monsters , though perhaps of Grecian ancestry . On the shoulders of a comely youth , uprose the head and branching antlers of a stag ; a second , human in all other points , had the grim visage of a wolf ; a third , still with the trunk and limbs of a mortal man , showed the beard and horns of a venerable he-goat . There was the likeness of a bear erect , brute in all but his hind legs , which were adorned with pink silk stockings . And here again , almost as wondrous , stood a real bear of the dark forest , lending each of his fore paws to the grasp of a human hand , and as ready for the dance as any in that circle . His inferior nature rose half-way , to meet his companions as they stooped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but distorted or extravagant , with red noses pendulous before their mouths , which seemed of awful depth , and stretched from ear to ear in an eternal fit of laughter . Here might be seen the Salvage Man , well known in heraldry , hairy as a baboon , and girdled with green leaves . By his side , a nobler figure , but still a counterfeit , appeared an Indian hunter , with feathery crest and wampum belt . Many of this strange company wore fools-caps , and had little bells appended to their garments , tinkling with a silvery sound , responsive to the inaudible music of their gleesome spirits . Some youths and maidens were of soberer garb , yet well maintained their places in the irregular throng , by the expression of wild revelry upon their features . Such were the colonists of Merry Mount , as they stood in the broad smile of sunset , round their venerated May-Pole . Had a wanderer , bewildered in the melancholy forest , heard their mirth , and stolen a half-affrighted glance , he might have fancied them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some midway between man and beast , and the others rioting in the flow of tipsey jollity that foreran the change . But a band of Puritans , who watched the scene , invisible themselves , compared the masques to those devils and ruined souls , with whom their superstition peopled the black wilderness .  | Within the ring of monsters , appeared the two airiest forms , that had ever trodden on any more solid footing than a purple and golden cloud . One was a youth , in glistening apparel with a scarf of the rainbow pattern crosswise on his breast . His right hand held a gilded staff , the ensign of high dignity among the revellers , and his left grasped the slender fingers of a fair maiden , not less gaily decorated than himself . Bright roses glowed in contrast with the dark and glossy curls of each , and were scattered round their feet , or had sprung up spontaneously there . Behind this lightsome couple , so close to the May-Pole that its boughs shaded his jovial face , stood the figure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers , in heathen fashion , and wearing a chaplet of the native vine leaves . By the riot of his rolling eye , and the pagan decorations of his holy garb , he seemed the wildest monster there , and the very Comus of the crew . The May-Pole of Merry Mount ' , The Token and Atlantic Souvenir ( 1836 ) and Twice-told Tales ( 1837 , 1842 ) ' Having alerted his readers to the allegorical significance of his tale in his introductory note , Hawthorne sets two abstractions ? jollity and gloom ? in opposition to each other , telling us that these forces or principles were contending for rule in New England when the colony of Merry Mount existed . In metaphoric terms , sunshine and flower-seeds represent jollity , while gloom is embodied in the rugged hills of New England . The emblem of the mirthful spirit ' of May is , of course , the maypole of the gay Merry Mounters . For the opposing emblem we have to wait until the Puritans appear . Then we learn that they danced only round the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first part of the tale , attention is focused on the merriment of the colonists at Mount Wollaston . In their devotion to the spirit of May they are linked with the fertility of the natural world , represented by the green of the forest and the midsummer roses . Yet the positive associations of natural growth and joy are qualified by a false , or forced , note : the mirthful spirit of May dwelt ' all the year round at Merry Mount , we are told . The pun on the word dwelt ' makes Hawthorne 's point succinctly and unobtrusively . For May to dwell ( live ) with its devotees is natural , but for May to remain or linger on Mount Wollaston , prolonging its stay and its spirit through summer , autumn and even winter , is unnatural , even perverse . Mirth that goes on sporting , revelling through the seasons until it basks before the warmth of winter fires , is unseasonable mirth and wilful in its disregard of change .  | In the second paragraph we focus on the maypole itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May Day celebrations , and we notice that the emblematic tree has the characteristics of youth and age : the slender grace of the one and the lofty height of the other . It is , of course , fitting that the tree should be decorated only with gay colours and with both wild and cultivated flowers , but the metaphor that makes the flowers laugh ' amid the green of the pine tree , though it here seems an apt and decorative literary phrase , will become disturbing when the implications of the spirit of mirth are developed . Similarly , the pine tree is , like its devotees , happy ' . The wild roses that hang from the lowest bough of the pine bring with them a suggestion of the sunshine in which they grew , while the cultivated roses are associated with the Old England that , before the rule of the Puritans , was itself merry . At the end of the paragraph , the Merry Mount colonists are , it seems , given their most positive association : they are linked through their cultivation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fall brought the curse of hard toil on him . To the Puritans , the Original Sin that led to the expulsion from Eden had so corrupted human nature that , in post-lapsarian man , the natural was synonymous with the sinful ; unless redeemed by God 's grace , man was doomed to eternal damnation . If the Merry Mount people are indeed living in the Golden Age , before the Fall of Man , they are innocent ' and may well venerate an emblem of the natural order , but the hint of unnaturalness in the opening paragraph is developed in the words fantastic ' and grown by magic ' in the paragraph that follows . The implication ? though slight ? that there might be something forced , or even sinister , in the ornamentation of the pine tree picks up a suggestion of unreality that lurked among the positive associations at the end of the first paragraph . The spirit of May , we were told , flitted with a dreamlike smile ' through the world of toil and care in order to reach Merry Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real world , then the spirit of May , when extended through the year , is dreamlike ' in its merriment . Further , the worship of that spirit is possible only to those who live in a world of fantasy and whose actions are fantastic . When we look closely at the people of the Mount Wollaston community , we see that they are wild ' in the sense that they belong to the wilderness ? to the untamed , uncivilized world beyond the extent of moral laws . Associating the masquers with the fauns and nymphs of classical legend , driven out of Europe by the spread of Christianity , Hawthorne wittily links them with all exiles from Europe who sought freedom in the New World , including the Puritans . But the classical  | association is quickly displaced by that of the Gothic , for the costumes worn by the masquers are grotesque , even monstrous . The mixture of human and animal forms indicates that the Merry Mounters are intimate with nature in a way that the Puritans are not , but the union of man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the human , making it necessary for the man to stoop ' in order to meet the bear . The colonists are pictured in sunlight , but even here the language used has insidious connotations for the broad smile ' of the sunlight links with the mouths stretched from ear to ear in an eternal fit of laughter ' . The vocabulary of merriment used to convey the spirit of Merry Mount has already extended from gaiety and jollity to mirth , sport , revelry , in the first paragraph . Now the gleesome spirits ' of the masqueraders are linked with the tinkling bells of the fool's-caps , with the result that even the laughter of the flowers and the smile of the sun are implicated in the suggestion of fatuity . The costumes of the Merry Mounters are as fantastic as the ornaments of the maypole . The shapes that appear in the masque are counterfeit ' , not real , but mere figments of the imagination . They belong , with the dreamlike ' smile of May , to the world of illusion . At this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the outer scene , for they are not yet visible to the masquers . With them they bring moral judgement on the equivocally natural world of Merry Mount , for to the Puritan imagination the masques are diabolic , while the woods are the home of devils . The Puritan sees the wilderness as black ' , the Devil 's colour , for there is no place in his system of belief for the green ? innocent ? natural world . Since the Fall , any identification of the natural with the good must , in the Puritan view , be illusory , part of a fantasy . The narrator of the tale distances himself from the Puritans , describing their belief in devils as itself a superstition , but by imagining a bewildered wanderer 's feelings in the melancholy ' forest the narrator has , for the moment , adopted the Puritan view . The identification of the Merry Mounters with Comus 's wild rabble is offered as no more than a possible fancy ' of a lost and puzzled traveller ? the narrator does not lend his authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link with the corrupting and debased figure created in Milton 's Comus ; A Masque is enough to counter the earlier connotations of natural innocence at Merry Mount . Milton 's Comus is the enemy of chastity ; his spell has the power to bestialize human beings . The narrator 's judgements and evaluations in this tale are elusive . Associations that at first appear positive are transformed into their opposites by the magic of the prose . The voice that speaks to the reader  | is , we might say , that of a weaver of powerful spells who seems to let us wander , bewildered , in a forest of suggestions . But a pattern begins to emerge clearly when the insinuations of the early paragraphs harden into explicit moral judgements . The pagan dress and the riotous eye of the priest who officiates at the heathen marriage ceremony associate him with Comus , while his advice to the young lovers is patently frivolous . The narrator comments , describing the continual carnival of Merry Mount as one of jest and delusion , trick and fantasy ' . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a look that is pensive ' in spite of all the jollity , the moral is drawn clearly : No sooner had their hearts glowed with real passion , than they were sensible of something vague and unsubstantial in their former pleasures , and felt a dreary presentiment of inevitable change . ' To love truly , the narrator adds , is to subject oneself to earth 's doom of care , and sorrow , and troubled joy ' and to feel that Merry Mount is no real home . The bland vocabulary of pleasure is now replaced by that of complex emotion . From jollity and merriment we have moved to the oxymoron troubled joy ' . Turning from his tableau to provide some historical information about the Mount Wollaston colony , the narrator explains that these refugees from Puritan austerity preserved the ancient ceremonies and customs of Old England . From Hawthorne 's account of them , these rites were plainly pagan . His reading in Joseph Strutt 's The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England , mentioned in the introductory note , had taught Hawthorne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' but though he borrowed details of the decoration of the sacred tree from Strutt 's book , he left it to his readers to draw their own conclusions about the moral effects of an obviously phallic cult . The sexual freedom of Merry Mount receives no explicit comment , but the deliberate frivolity of the elders of the colony does . Any dignity that might accrue to their natural religion is undermined by the verdict pronounced on their wilful devotion to a counterfeit happiness . The aged members of the colony play the fool ' instead of acquiring wisdom . The Puritans , when we meet them , are stern and grim . Their cult of the whipping-post plainly expresses their repression of all natural impulses , including the sexual . With their piety goes cruelty and aggressiveness ; they carry armour with them and use it in their wars of extermination against the Indian . These men of iron ' reject the natural life . Endicott , the Puritan of Puritans , seems made of iron himself and assaults ' the maypole with his sword , destroying its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was opposed to jollity '  | in the first paragraph of the tale , the Puritans reject the fanciful as well as the natural , and personify the sternest cares of life ' . The triumph of the Puritans in the conflict with the people of Merry Mount meant , the narrator has told us , the banishment of sunshine and flowers from New England , and the reign of hard toil in a land of clouded visages ' , sermons and psalms . Until the entrance of Endicott on the scene , the narrative interest of the tale has been concentrated in the evaluation of clusters of opposed ideas . Instead of dramatic action , we have witnessed the interaction of sets of values , so that the story has been static or essayistic . ' With the destruction of the maypole , the oft-told tale of Puritan victory has been told again , and the interest must lie in the fate of the Lord and Lady of the May , the young lovers who have been cast down from the gaiety of their pagan marriage ceremony . Though Endicott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man of iron is sufficiently softened by the sight of true love to spare further punishment . What is more , he actually garlands the lovers with their emblematic roses . Their future must lie in the Puritan fold , for their wild home has been made desolate , yet though they are to be subject to the forces of gloom ' , the narrator concludes his tale with a moral judgement that apparently commits him to the Puritan side in the conflict of values . His earlier apparent neutrality seems superseded when he tells us that the lovers never wasted one regretful thought on the vanities of Merry Mount ' as they went heavenward , supporting each other along the difficult path which it was their lot to tread ' . We can not really suppose that the narrator has aligned himself with the Puritans , for his earlier images of their severity and grimness remain with us , but we must recognize that the deceptively simple antithesis with which the story started has now been replaced by the concept of troubled joy ' and by the association of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Puritan rather than the broad , sunshiny smiles of the masquers of Merry Mount . The May-Pole of Merry Mount ' is a relatively early Hawthorne story ? it was published first in The Token , in 1836 , and then included in the 1837 collection Twice-told Tales ? yet it introduces many of the themes that were to interest Hawthorne throughout his writing career . The contrast between the wild freedom of the forest and the repressive code of Puritan law plays a crucial part in The Scarlet Letter ( 1850 ) . The theory that the innocence of the natural man , though it gives him the youthful spontaneity of the animal , may be incompatible with the full development of his human nature , is a central concern of The Marble Faun ( 1860 ) . Almost all Hawthorne 's fictions deal to some extent with  | the relationship of fancy or imagination , and reality , and many of them use the Puritans to stand for the reality principle . Hawthorne 's perennial theme is the necessity , and the sadness , of human love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their treatment , involving fictional characters of far greater complexity than the Lord and Lady of the May , Hawthorne 's early tale illuminates his major novels . Between 1830 and 1837 he published nine tales based on the history of his region in the seventeenth century , 3 though by the latter year he seems to have felt that his art should relate more obviously to the contemporary world . Writing to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in that year , Hawthorne complained of his lack of literary materials . I have seen so little of the world ' , he wrote , that I have nothing but thin air to concoct my stories of , and it is not easy to give a lifelike semblance to such shadowy stuff . ' This damaging association of his own imaginative world with thin air and shadows , and a sense of isolation from the real world ' , was not confined to the letter to Longfellow . As we shall see , it recurs in many of Hawthorne 's explicit comments on his art and in many of his fictional accounts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrator clearly associated the fantasy world of Mount Wollaston with the realm of art , for he pointed out that many of the refugees from the severity of Puritan rule in England were entertainers , including minstrels and actors . In The Custom House ' section of The Scarlet Letter , Hawthorne imagines the horror his Puritan ancestors would have felt had they known that their family tree would one day produce an idler ' , a mere writer of story books ' . To such men , there was little to choose between being a story-writer and being a fiddler , Hawthorne admits , but he also adds that , however much they would have despised him , strong traits of their nature have intertwined themselves with his own . In his sometimes disparaging comments on his own art , it is as if Hawthorne temporarily allowed the Puritan in himself to speak , making use of that voice to carry on a debate within the self . If the Puritans rejected the arts and destroyed the realms of fancy and dream so closely associated with the imagination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May-Pole ' find a more fitting home with them than with the masquers ? To love truly is to subject oneself to care and sorrow , we were told , but ? as another tale on a related theme makes clear ? care and sorrow without love give the bleakest of all possible worlds . In The Canterbury Pilgrims ' ( 1833 ) , the Shakers replace the Puritans as the representatives of a piety that rejects sexual love . The  | young lovers of this tale are not placed between the forces of mirth and gloom , but they must choose between the safety of the cold , loveless Shaker community and the dangers of the world outside it . They choose the world where human love includes sexuality , and in doing so they choose the possibility of passion and the likelihood of suffering . All the evidence they have warns them that even their love may not survive the frustrations of life in the world of toil and sadness , yet only there can the love they feel flourish . As in The May-Pole of Merry Mount ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the real ' world of human anguish . The Canterbury Pilgrims ' was not published with Twice-told Tales , but another tale with a related theme , The Shaker Bridal ' ( 1838 ) , was collected in the second and enlarged edition of those tales in 1842 . In it we are present at another moment of choice , and here the decision must be made by former lovers who have long since entered a Shaker community , largely because the man has been so disappointed with life that he has lost all hope and all capacity to love . If they accept the offer made to them and take over the leadership of the Shaker settlement at Goshen , Adam and Martha , like all eminent Shakers , will have overcome their natural sympathy with human frailties and affections ' , for the Shakers permit no closer tie than the cold fraternal one of the sect ' . Adam , whose severe aspect and corpse-like rigidity is stressed throughout the sketch , is ready to sacrifice any possibility of renewed love with Martha , but she still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's heart ' that is appalled at his cold resolution . The title of the sketch is heavily ironic , for Martha 's bridegroom is death , while the piety and moral determination of the Shaker sect is consistently associated with the coldness of the tomb . In both sketches , the icy coldness of the Shakers is attributed to their renunciation of the joys as well as the sorrows of earthly life . They are Merry Mounters in reverse , but no more admirable or attractive . Endicott , the iron Puritan of Puritans , seems almost warm-hearted in comparison to the Shakers , yet ? as some of Hawthorne 's best tales illustrate ? the Puritan sense of sin could be totally destructive of human love . Young Goodman Brown , in the tale that takes his name as its title , becomes so obsessed with the sin he senses all around him , even in the Puritan village of Salem , that he wanders in the dark forest of his dreams until , aided by the diabolical guide his fancy offers him , he discovers the forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a witches ' Sabbath . Taught by the Devil that all whom he had thought holy were implicated in the dark mysteries of sin , Young Goodman Brown sees his wife Faith at the evil altar and thus  | loses his Faith ' and his love at once . Throughout the description of Brown 's forest journey , the language of the tale leaves the status of the events in doubt . Everything seems ' or appears ' to the young man , nothing unequivocally is . Though the status of the figures that haunt the forest is in doubt , the effect of his vision on the young man is not . From the night of his dream he becomes a stern , a sad , a darkly meditative , a distrustful , if not a desperate man ' whose love for his wife has turned to distrust and even repugnance . This young Puritan has espoused the cause of gloom ' , the word on which his story ends . Young Goodman Brown ' was first published in the New-England Magazine in 1835 , though it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an Old Manse ( 1846 ) to take its place in a collection of Hawthorne 's works . A tale with a closely related theme that did find its way into the earlier collection was The Minister 's Black Veil ' , subtitled by Hawthorne A Parable ' . The veil of black crepe with which the Reverend Hooper covers his eyes until his dying day is an emblem , the narrator tells us , that probably did not interfere with his sight farther than to give a darkened aspect to all living and inanimate things ' . When challenged by Elizabeth , his betrothed , Hooper will only say that the veil is a type and a symbol ' ; he refuses to be specific about what the veil signifies , though the first sermon he preached after adopting the veil was on the secret sin that would like to hide itself from God . The effect of that sermon was to make his congregation feel guilty , and the effect of his veil is to make him feared or hated . His presence at a marriage ceremony makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . Typically , in this tale Hawthorne is concerned with the effect of the emblem that shadows forth horrors ' and particularly with the effect on the woman who loves Hooper . In separating the minister from the world , as he says it must , the veil cuts him off from woman 's love , for he refuses to allow Elizabeth to see his face . Though she remains devoted to him till his death , we are told that he had no natural connections ' when he came to die , for the veil had isolated him from the human race . In the death-bed scene , the irony that has accompanied every reference to the veil achieves a new prominence : though Hooper 's donning of the veil has been justified , in his terms , by the belief that any mortal ' has secret sin enough to make the symbolic gesture appropriate , when about to die he speaks of the Black Veil he sees on every human face . Sense of one 's own sin , for this minister as for Goodman Brown , means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One further tale develops the theme in a direction that makes it  | central in Hawthorne 's works . In The Man of Adamant ' ( 1837 ) , Richard Digby 's intolerable awareness of human sinfulness has as its corollary a heightened form of the Puritans ' sense that salvation is possible only for the chosen few : Digby believes that he alone is to be saved . Physically removing himself from communion ' with his fellow men out of fear of moral contagion , he retires to a cave in the forest . But the cave is a tomb-like den ' and Digby 's severance of human ties is a choice of death rather than love . The emblematic nature of the cave is not left in doubt , for just as its moisture petrifies the leaves , foliage and shrubs within it , Digby suffers from a disease that is likely to change his fleshly heart to stone ' . To complete the picture of the moral bigot , we see that he rejects the vision of a woman angelic ' in her pity and love for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that converts its message into vengeance instead of mercy . As the allegory takes its course , Digby 's moral and emotional petrification is signified , on the literal level , by the conversion of flesh to stone ; he becomes a man of adamant ' . In the concluding moral , Digby 's horribly lonely sepulchre is said to be inimical not only to human but also to celestial ' sympathies . To break communion with one 's fellow men is to turn one 's higher faculties to stone : Friendship , and Love , and Piety ' are equally petrified in the isolated human heart . Digby , like the Reverend Hooper , lacks charity . In both cases , the lack of charity blinds the pious ' man to the true meaning of Christ . In The Canterbury Pilgrims ' , the young man leaving the Shakers to live and to love in the world outside the commune explains that Father Job , the Shaker elder , has little charity for what he calls the iniquities of the flesh ' and is therefore an awe-inspiring man . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist apart . Those who react with horror to human sexuality , or who are obsessed with guilt at their own sexual impulses , are invariably lacking in charity , and are often capable of great cruelty , even to the extent of having a deadly effect on those who can and do love . But if Hawthorne 's positives are as uncontentious as love and human warmth , and if his ideal is the mutual bond ' of the domestic fire , whose warmth and beauty he celebrates with great tact and self-deprecatory wit in Fire-Worship ' ( 1843 ) , they do not make him a sentimentalist , nor does it mean that he has nothing to offer as a thinker . The avowedly unheroic use to which Hawthorne puts the Promethean gift draws its psychological significance from the most sustained theme in all his writings : that of the difficulty with which human warmth is created and preserved in a world where all life leads to death . The corollary of this theme is a haunting sense of the ease with which  | the reflective man or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love and experiencing its warmth . The Christmas Banquet ' ( 1844 ) was included in Mosses from an Old Manse with a note describing it as one of an unpublished series of Allegories of the Heart ' . This allegory tells of Gervayse Hastings , whose outward life has been perfectly successful , and whose family life has been blessed with a beautiful and affectionate wife and promising children . Yet Hastings is the most wretched of mortals because he is unable to respond to love . His cold abstraction ' chills all who come into contact with him . In a final cri de c , rur , Hastings explains his own misery as ' a chillness ? a want of earnestness ? a feeling as if what should be my heart were a thing of vapor ? a haunting perception of unreality ! ' Since he can not feel , he can not possess either joy or grief , and all the human beings who should have been taken into his heart have been mere shadows to him . Hastings is no Puritan or Shaker bigot whose isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer no motive for his coldness , nor any cause for it . In this he is like the title character in Wakefield ' ( 1835 ) , who for no clear reason casts himself out of the human race by simply leaving his wife and his home after ten years of placid marriage , and plays the voyeur on his wife 's loneliness for twenty further years . Though we are told that ' Wakefield retained his original share of human sympathies through his long , self-imposed exile and was still involved in human interests , the sketch creates a haunting sense of his lasting loneliness in his role of Outcast of the Universe ' . That Hawthorne was fascinated by the lonesome heart ' of the man who can feel nothing acutely is clear from The Old Apple-Dealer ' ( 1843 ) , a sketch of an old man whose whole aspect suggests a moral frost ' . No dark secret is revealed in this ruminative essay on a figure observed only from the outside , but the sketch is a study in the soundless depths of the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examines the Old Apple Dealer 's soul looks on him , he tells us , with a stranger 's eye ' . The voice that speaks in a very early sketch , Sights from a Steeple ' ( 1831 ) , speaks from a great height above the tumult of human life and states that the most desirable mode of existence might be that of a spiritualized Paul Pry , hovering invisible round man and woman , witnessing their deeds , searching into their hearts , borrowing brightness from their felicity , and shade from their sorrow , and retaining no emotion peculiar to himself ' . In this sketch the mood of the artist-voyeur is exultant , but in the later Fragments from the Journal of a Solitary Man ' ( 1837 ) , the artist Oberon feels that he has merely skimmed the surface of life , for the  | meditative man who devotes his talents to writing takes no part in the serious business of life ' . Oberon feels doomed to eternal loneliness and feels his life to have been a mere shadow because he has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the common path and accepting domestic responsibilities . In a nightmare vision he sees himself wandering through the busy , life-filled Broadway but not belonging to it ; to the horror of the crowd , he is walking there in his shroud . Another Oberon sketch , The Devil in Manuscript ' ( 1835 ) , expresses the nausea of the writer who feels that his tales have displaced the real world for him , that his writing has been a dream-activity , and that the shadowy world he has created in his fictions has led him into a terrible solitude . In the letter to Longfellow written in 1837 , Hawthorne wrote for the last ten years I have not lived , but only dreamed about living ' . The ten years were those after Hawthorne had left Bowdoin College , in 1825 , and during which he had lived at home in Salem , with no occupation except that of writing . To Longfellow he wrote that he felt as if he had been carried apart from the main current of life and that he felt it impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snow-Image ( 1851 ) , which took the form of a letter addressed to his friend Horatio Bridge , Hawthorne used strikingly similar phrases to refer to his years of seclusion before Twice-told Tales brought him some fame in 1837 : I sat down by the wayside of life , like a man under enchantment ' , Hawthorne wrote , adding that Bridge 's confidence in his work had alone enabled him to break out of the entangling depths of my obscurity ' . In the same year ( 1851 ) the preface to a new edition of Twice-told Tales referred to the pale tint ' of these literary flowers whose blossoming had taken place in too retired a shade ' . With typical self-deprecation , Hawthorne accuses his fictions of lack of passion and admits that even in what purports to be pictures of actual life , we have allegory , not always so warmly dressed in its habiliments of flesh and blood , as to be taken into the reader 's mind without a shiver ' . In conceding that allegory was colder ' than realistic fiction , Hawthorne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the realistic novel and seemed to prefer it to his own romances ' . We know , for example , that he considered Anthony Trollope 's novels solid and substantial in a way that his own were not and that he pronounced their earthiness exactly to his taste . Even in the Custom-House ' section of The Scarlet Letter , Hawthorne accuses himself of folly in choosing to create the semblance of a world out of airy matter ' when he could have used his thought and imagination to discover the deeper significance of  | the daily life that seemed so dull and commonplace to him . Yet in the same place he states emphatically that the atmosphere of the CustomHouse was so inimical to his imagination that he could create nothing while he actually worked there . The ideal setting for creative imagination , he argues , is the family parlour , when , late at night , it is deserted by all but the writer . The mixture of firelight ( emblem of domestic warmth ) and moonlight ( emblem of the fancy ) makes this a neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the Actual and the Imaginary may meet , and each imbue itself with the nature of the other ' . Hawthorne 's fictional artists seldom manage to combine the warmer light of the domestic fire with the cold spirituality of the moonbeams ' . Hawthorne 's most complex study of the connection between artistic detachment and emotional coldness is Miles Coverdale , the narrator of The Blithedale Romance ( 1852 ) . Coverdale once had sufficient moral enthusiasm to commit himself to joining the idealistic , experimental community at Blithedale , but when he tells his tale he is already a frosty bachelor ' and the perfectionist scheme that caused him to quit his bachelor fireside to share in its Paradisiac vision is long since exploded . When he joined the commune , Coverdale hoped that its influence would inspire him to create true , strong and natural poetry , but he is never able to acknowledge the impulses of his own heart sufficiently to produce inspired art . Obviously attracted to the beautiful Zenobia , this unreliable narrator never admits the force of his interest in her and deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less sexually attractive Priscilla . Coverdale is drawn to Zenobia because to him it is clear that she is a sexually experienced woman : her presence makes the idyllic experiment of Blithedale seem like an illusion , a masquerade , a pastoral , a counterfeit Arcadia ' . Blithedale , then , in Coverdale 's account of it , has some features in common with Merry Mount , though the Blithedalers like to think that they have taken up the high enterprise ' of the Pilgrims and are going on to loftier ideals than their forefathers dreamed of . Yet even while they are building their homes , Coverdale remarks that the soil beneath their feet was fathom deep with the dust of deluded generations ' on whose virginal innocence the world had imposed experience . His thoughts turn half-humorously , but portentously as it turns out , to the need for a cemetery in Arcadia , for Coverdale is always aware of the cold climate of this New England idyll . The artist who lacks emotional conviction is the artist who observes the lives of others from his steeple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intellect ' that made him pry with a speculative interest into people 's passions and impulses ' and he is aware that his heart has lost much of its humanity as a result . But he can not resist the impulse to pry , and he even justifies it to himself , claiming a generous sympathy with those in whose lives he lives vicariously and whose secrets he endeavours to learn . Zenobia , the passionate and proud woman , is destroyed by Hollingsworth , the bigoted reformer , rather than by Coverdale the minor or failed poet , but there can be no doubt that Coverdale fails Zenobia through his faint-heartedness . Coverdale was no Transcendentalist ? in fact he describes himself as a realist ; Hawthorne , as he wrote in his introduction to Rappaccini 's Daughter ' , published in the Democratic Review in 1844 , occupied the middle ground between the Transcendentalists and the general public . In The Old Manse ' introduction to Mosses from an Old Manse ( 1846 ) he wrote with great respect of Emerson as an original thinker , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this sketch he is severe in his judgement of the lunatic fringe of Transcendentalism ? the wild reformers who seem to him stupid . In The Old Manse ' , as in Fire Worship ' , the positive is the hearth of a household fire ' ; against that sacred symbol he sets a comic , but typical , allusion to Eden in the rain . In Blithedale the idea recurs in the coldness of a New England Arcadia in early spring . In both , idealistic fancy seems like fantasy when it is set in a bleak natural environment . If Coverdale is a portrait of the artist with a cold heart , in the same romance Hollingsworth is a portrait of the nineteenth-century man of iron : the inheritor of the bigotry of Puritan idealism . He is , appropriately , described as a polar bear on his first appearance at Blithedale , so cold is he within and without . To Coverdale , Hollingsworth seems not altogether human , because he has given himself up to a dominant purpose . Ironically , that purpose is philanthropic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is prepared to sacrifice individual human beings to an overriding scheme or purpose , even if that is nominally a philanthropic programme , is a steel engine of the Devil 's contrivance ' . Not only does Hollingsworth have iron features ' , he has a brow on which a frown forms an adamantine wrinkle ' . Since his great scheme is to build a reform-house for criminals , and since this project proceeds from his dark vision of human depravity , he is fittingly associated , through Coverdale 's imagery , with Hawthorne 's Man of Adamant ' as well as with his Reverend Hooper . He is also linked with Roderick Elliston , the man who , in one of Hawthorne 's Allegories of the Heart ' , is gnawed by Egotism ; or the Bosom-Serpent ' ; but Hollingsworth  | does not realize , as Elliston did , that he has become a prey to the monster of his own creation . Nor is his bosom-serpent banished by a woman 's love , for he exploits all who love him . Hollingsworth , as a character in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allegorical sketch referred to or Ethan Brand in the tale named after him , yet the moral pattern informing his behaviour is exactly that which determines the form of the two related allegorical sketches . The difference is that , in The Blithedale Romance , Hawthorne has given the abstract principle of egotism a concrete manifestation in terms relevant to the cultural situation of the 1840s . Reformist zeal was a reality in Hawthorne 's New England . He understood it ? typically ? by exploring its relation to the Puritan past . In The House of the Seven Gables ( 1851 ) , Hawthorne had already to some extent tackled contemporary issues in his art , though in his preface he had argued that as a romancer he was free from the obligation to be faithful to the probable and ordinary course of experience . There was , obviously , enough of the Marvellous ' in this romance to justify Hawthorne 's apologia in his preface , but in the character of Holgrave , the young man who at the age of twenty-two has already changed jobs half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his career , we are dealing with a plausible representative of the culture of expansionist ' America . Holgrave is a Northern radical ; to him the past is the corpse of an old giant that must be thrust out of the way if the present generation is to be able to live . Rejecting the rule of dead generations in the system of laws and the inheritance of property , he wants to start life anew , for he has the spirit of hope . To Holgrave , all ancient houses ? both the buildings and the families ? inhibit the possibilities of life for the new generation . All moss-covered buildings represent to him the great burden of the past on all new life , for they are emblematic of time-honoured institutions , but he has particular reason to regard the Pyncheon house as a symbol of a corrupt past , since it was cursed by his ancestor whose life was sacrificed to the greed of a Pyncheon . The founding father of the House of Pyncheon was an iron-hearted Puritan whose family mansion was built on corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puritan line are Judge Jaffrey , the inheritor of the Pyncheon greed and materialism , whose smiling surface conceals the rock of his true nature , and Clifford , his victim , who has in excess the sensibility that the iron men of the family have repressed for generations . For Clifford is another failed artist : he is an aesthete and a man of active fancy , but he lacks all  | strength of will or sense of purpose . Remaining in a state of arrested development as an artist as well as a man , Clifford 's heart lacks warmth . A lover of the beautiful , Clifford has never quaffed the cup of passionate love ' and has consequently remained a child . When restored to the House of the Seven Gables from the prison in which he has unfairly spent the best years of his life , Clifford hates the house as an impediment to human happiness and improvement . Pathetically , he exults in the symbols of nineteenth-century progress , the railroad and electricity , though he needs the shelter of a home more than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holgrave 's radicalism in The House of the Seven Gables reminds us that , in Main Street ' ( 1849 ) , Hawthorne depicted the Quakers in Emersonian terms as the inspired idealists whose life of the spirit was a threat to the civic and religious institutions of New England . In language that seems to echo Emerson 's essays , Hawthorne contrasts the rigidity of traditional ways , descended from the first ? Puritan ? settlers with the fervour of the Quakers who threaten to topple the spire of the meeting-house . Speaking through the showman ' who interprets the Main Street scene , Hawthorne seems to share the conviction that the forces of tradition and conservatism are destructive of both heart and intellect , but even here a balance is maintained as the value of continuity and the gradual accumulation of human associations is also acknowledged . The apparent volte-face at the end of The House of the Seven Gables , when Holgrave renounces his earlier radicalism and under the influence of Phoebe Pyncheon ? the spirit of sunshine and human warmth ? decides to establish his own family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent commitment to the ideal of domestic love . The Pyncheon house has become a symbol of the human heart as the romance has evolved , and though Holgrave will not live in so guiltladen a mansion , his acknowledgement that he must have a house is , at one level , only realism . The message of Earth 's Holocaust ' , one of Hawthorne 's finest sketches , is that the human heart will remain unchanged in its depths in spite of all reforms and all idealistic schemes for change . Nevertheless , we may still feel some unease at Holgrave 's readiness to become the conservative with a house of stone . When we first met him , Holgrave was introduced to us as the artist ' ; we see him at the last as an arriviste . Hawthorne 's ambivalent attitude to the artist informs The Prophetic Pictures ' ( 1837 ) and Fancy 's Show Box ' ( 1837 ) , both of which explore the possibility that the artist should feel guilt for his treatment  | of the human heart . In the former tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme , for his dedication to his art kills his natural human response to the subjects he uses ; he sees the inmost soul of man , but his lack of feeling makes him , in the mechanism of the tale , a possible agent of evil , since ? godlike ? he foresees all . The second sketch draws analogies between plotting a tale and plotting a crime ; both involve dreaming , or exercising the fancy . Even the triumph of the artist over the sceptic and materialist in The Artist of the Beautiful ' ( 1844 ) is qualified by the moral cold ' and emotional isolation of Owen Warland , the devotee of the spirit of beauty ' . Only in Drowne 's Wooden Image ' ( 1846 ) does the warmth of human passion convert the merely wooden ' work of the wood-carver Drowne into great art . When that happens , the art-work itself becomes an expression of human love . Opposed to the Puritan men of iron in The Scarlet Letter stands Hawthorne 's most passionate artist , Hester Prynne.4 Her art is needlework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in in seventeenthcentury Massachusetts , and her only theme is the scarlet A ' she wears on the breast of her gown . Pearl 's clothes , on which she also employs her artistry , are an extension of the A ' , for Pearl is the living hieroglyphic ' in which the secret she and Dimmesdale sought to hide is set before the world . Hester has embroidered the scarlet letter so artistically . . . and with so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance of fancy ' that her work seems to announce not shame but the belief she later makes explicit : that her act of love with Dimmesdale had a consecration of its own ' . Her skill in embroidering the letter is delicate and imaginative ' , and expresses her taste for the gorgeously beautiful ' . Yet Hester is not just a lover of the beautiful : she is a passionate and independent woman who threatens the Puritan system of authority as well as its severe moral code . The glancing reference to Anne Hutchinson in the first chapter of the romance associates Hester 's transgression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the spiritual authority of the New England ministers of the Church . The wildness of Hester 's nature was such , the narrator tells us , that it might have assimilated itself to the forest dwellers to whom Puritan law was alien ? the Indians . In the forest with Dimmesdale , Hester feels the wild , free atmosphere of the lawless and unchristianized region so exhilarating ' that she believes she can throw off the past with the scarlet symbol . In doing this , she escapes from what the narrator calls the dungeon ' of her own heart , and as a consequence her youth and her rich beauty return to her . The nature of the forest sympathizes  | with Hester and with Dimmesdale , for it is heathen nature , unsubdued by law . Forest and ocean are appropriate regions for the rejection of the symbol of her shame , for both are beyond the control of human law , but if Hester could ever be associated with the ethos of Merry Mount , her experience in the forest makes it clear that she could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hester 's freedom from the symbolic A ' is brief because Pearl , who is herself as wild as the sea-breeze , a law unto herself , a child of the forest , an elf , a fairy rather than a human being , insists that her mother continue to wear the emblematic letter . Psychologically this is plausible , for Pearl can not recognize her mother without the ornament she has always worn in the child 's memories of her . Morally this is appropriate , for since Pearl is the scarlet letter endowed with life ? the fruit of the deed signified by the A ' ? Hester can not both reject the symbol and keep Pearl . Though she is the pearl of great price ' for which her mother has sold all that she had , Pearl is not fully human until she has been recognized by her father and until she has experienced sorrow . When Dimmesdale acknowledges his child , Pearl can love him and share his grief . She at once learns something that the inhabitants of Merry Mount could never learn : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At Merry Mount , funerals were conducted with the jollity that characterized all life there . For that reason , in The May-Pole of Merry Mount ' the world of art was the world of the dream and was itself chimerical . In The Scarlet Letter the artist survives in a world of care , and sorrow , and troubled joy ' , and makes art out of sadness .

Brownson ( 1803-76 ) No one can observe the signs of the times with much care , without perceiving that a crisis as to the relation of wealth and labor is approaching . It is useless to shut our eyes to the fact , and like the ostrich fancy ourselves secure because we have so concealed our heads that we see not the danger . We or our children will have to meet this crisis . The old war between the King and the Barons is well nigh ended , and so is that between the Barons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital . The business man has become the peer of my Lord . And now commences the new struggle between the operative and his employer , between wealth and labor . Every day does this struggle extend further and wax stronger and fiercer ; what or when the end will be God only knows . In this coming contest there is a deeper question at issue than is commonly imagined ; a question which is but remotely touched in your controversies about United States Banks and Sub Treasuries , chartered Banking and free Banking , free trade and corporations , although these controversies may be paving the way for it to come up . We have discovered no presentiment of it in any king 's or queen 's speech , nor in any president 's message . It is embraced in no popular political creed of the day , whether christened Whig or Tory , Juste-milieu or Democratic . No popular senator , or deputy , or peer seems to have any glimpse of it ; but it is working in the hearts of the million , is struggling to shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in thunder tones . Well will it be for him , who , on that day , shall be found ready to answer it . What we would ask is , throughout the Christian world , the actual condition of the laboring classes , viewed simply and exclusively in their capacity of laborers ? They constitute at least a moiety of the human race . We exclude the nobility , we exclude also the middle class , and include only actual laborers , who are laborers and not proprietors , owners of none of the funds of production , neither houses , shops , nor  | lands , nor implements of labor , being therefore solely dependent on their hands . We have no means of ascertaining their precise proportion to the whole number of the race ; but we think we may estimate them at one half . In any contest they will be as two to one , because the large class of proprietors who are not employers , but laborers on their own lands or in their own shops will make common cause with them . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to allege that these alone perform all that is necessary to the production of wealth . We are not ignorant of the fact , that the merchant , who is literally the common carrier and exchange dealer , performs a useful service , and is therefore entitled to a portion of the proceeds of labor . But make all necessary deductions on his account , and then ask what portion of the remainder is retained , either in kind or in its equivalent , in the hands of the original producer , the workingman ? All over the world this fact stares us in the face , the workingman is poor and depressed , while a large portion of the non-workingmen , in the sense we now use the term , are wealthy . It maybe laid down as a general rule , with but few exceptions , that men are rewarded in an inverse ratio to the amount of actual service they perform . Under every government on earth the largest salaries are annexed to those offices , which demand of their incumbents the least amount of actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect harmony with the whole system of repartition of the fruits of industry , which obtains in every department of society . Now here is the system which prevails , and here is its result . The whole class of simple laborers are poor , and in general unable to procure anything beyond the bare necessaries of life . In regard to labor two systems obtain ; one that of slave labor , the other that of free labor . Of the two , the first is , in our judgment , except so far as the feelings are concerned , decidedly the least oppressive . If the slave has never been a free man , we think , as a general rule , his sufferings are less than those of the free laborer at wages . As to actual freedom one has just about as much as the other . The laborer at wages has all the disadvantages of freedom and none of its blessings , while the slave , if denied the blessings , is freed from the disadvantages . We are no advocates of slavery , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ; but we say frankly that , if there must always be a laboring population distinct from proprietors and employers , we regard the slave system as decidedly preferable to the system at wages . It is no pleasant thing to go days without food , to lie idle for weeks , seeking work and finding none , to rise in the morning with a wife and children you love , and know not where to procure them a breakfast , and to see  | constantly before you no brighter prospect than the almshouse . Yet these are no unfrequent incidents in the lives of our laboring population . Even in seasons of general prosperity , when there was only the ordinary cry of hard times , ' we have seen hundreds of people in a no sic very populous village , in a wealthy portion of our common country , suffering for the want of the necessaries of life , willing to work , and yet finding no work to do . Many and many is the application of a poor man for work , merely for his food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of , for the applicants are poor ; they fill no conspicuous place in society , and they have no biographers . But their wrongs are chronicled in heaven . It is said there is no want in this country . There may be less than in some other countries . But death by actual starvation in this country is , we apprehend , no uncommon occurrence . The sufferings of a quiet , unassuming but useful class of females in our cities , in general sempstresses , too proud to beg or to apply to the alms-house , are not easily told . They are industrious ; they do all that they can find to do ; but yet the little there is for them to do , and the miserable pittance they receive for it , is hardly sufficient to keep soul and body together . And yet there is a man who employs them to make shirts , trousers , &c.,; and grows rich on their labors . He is one of our respectable citizens , perhaps is praised in the newspapers for his liberal donations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern of morality , and is honored as a worthy Christian . And why should he not be , since our Christian community is made up of such as he , and since our clergy would not dare question his piety , lest they should incur the reproach of infidelity , and lose their standing , and their salaries ? Nay , since our clergy are raised up , educated , fashioned , and sustained by such as he ? Not a few of our churches rest on Mammon for their foundation . The basement is a trader 's shop . The Laboring Classes ' ( 1840 ) ' In the first sentence of the extract , Brownson asserts that to observe the signs of the times ' carefully is to perceive that a crisis in the relations between the classes is approaching . The prose does more than convey the writer 's opinion here : it also enforces his theory by means of its lexical strategy . To see the signs is necessarily to accept the writer 's interpretation of them , for they exist as signs only if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the signs is to accept Brownson 's interpretation of their significance , not to see them is merely to prove oneself  | ( in the logic of the sentence ) unobservant , for the words are telling us that the signs in question are the signs of the times . To read the sentence is thus to enter an enclosed system of thought that is structured by the peremptory judgements of the writer , yet the following sentence asserts that the approaching crisis is a fact ; not to see it is to be worse than unobservant , for it is deliberately to bury one 's head , ostrich-fashion . The series of related words used to express the meaning of the crisis moves from danger , to war , and on to struggle . In doing so it associates the hypothetical class conflict with the historical strife between royalty and nobility . In an earlier part of his article , which begins as a review of Carlyle 's Chartism , Brownson had already asserted that war was the only means by which a fairer distribution of wealth could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American society . The implication of the final sentence is that the struggle is growing wider and fiercer even as one reads . So grave is the situation that the writer can not predict its final outcome . Since God only knows ' how or when the inevitable struggle will end , we may be sure that it will be great and terrible . Brownson 's strategy in the second paragraph is a development of that adopted in the first . The party-political issues of the day are alluded to and dismissed as trivial when compared to the profounder concerns that make the coming contest ' inevitable . 1840 , the year in which Brownson 's two-part article The Laboring Classes ' appeared in his Boston Quarterly Review , was the year of a presidential election that seemed to him crucial for the future of American democracy . After years of holding aloof from both major parties , Brownson had decided that the Democrats were at last becoming truly the party of liberty and humanity . He had allowed George Bancroft , a leading member of the Massachusetts Democratic Party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buren re-elected as president . Once convinced that the party was no longer corrupt , Brownson was able to support its cause with enthusiasm , for his belief that the banks were allied with the business classes against the working people coincided with Democratic Party policy . Brownson had attacked the banks in an article , The Sub-Treasury Bill ' , in 1838 , but he now appeals over the heads of all politicians of whatever party or persuasion to the hearts of the million ' . At the end of the second paragraph there is a shift of register as Brownson assumes the role of the Old Testament prophet . The promise that the social question will be asked in thunder tones ' is followed by the biblical echoes of the words Well will it be for him who , on that day , shall be found ready to answer it . ' The day is the Day of Doom ; Brownson 's vision is apocalyptic.  | With another sudden shift of tone and style , Brownson drops his thundering prophecy to ask a direct question in plain language . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes in the Christian world . Before attempting to answer his own question , he offers an analysis of the structure of society that seems logical and unimpassioned . Defining the labouring classes as those who have no property or capital and must therefore depend for their livelihood on the wages they receive , Brownson argues that the labourer is the original producer ' of the proceeds ' of industry , even though he makes use of his employer 's capital and property . In formulating his general rule that rewards are distributed in inverse ratio to the amount of actual service performed , Brownson adopts the language and the stance of the political economist who examines economic facts with detachment . By admitting that merchants perform a service and so deserve a portion of the proceeds , and by including the mental with the manual in his category of actual labor ' , Brownson clearly intends to be rational and fair , but the paragraph ends with a severe indictment of the system that leaves the whole class of simple laborers ' so poor that they must live at subsistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow his logic wherever it will lead him , without regard to his readers ' sense of propriety . When he argues that the system of free labour is more oppressive than that of slave labour , he adduces the favourite argument of Southern apologists for slavery . As late as 1856 , Abraham Lincoln found himself obliged to refute similar arguments in favour of the extension of slavery ( see p. 235 ) . In 1840 Brownson obviously knew that Northern readers of the Boston Quarterly Review who opposed slavery would be shocked by his argument , but the key to his strategy lies in the phrase actual freedom ' , which relates to his announced intention of enquiring into the actual condition ' of the labouring classes . By asserting that the labourer for wages has all the disadvantages of freedom from which the slave is protected , Brownson challenges the unreflecting use of the word freedom ' as a slogan . Justifiable pride in America 's progress towards political freedom could go with complacency about social injustice and economic servitude , so he believed . Freedom is Brownson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his writings up to 1844 , but where George Bancroft had seen the triumph of the mercantile classes as a stage in the great march towards liberty , Brownson sees the middle classes , not the aristocractic , as the enemies of the proletariat . When he writes of the actual condition of the workers , Brownson  | constructs a sentence on a series of infinitives : to go days without food , to lie idle for weeks . . . to rise in the morning with a wife and children you love , and know not where to procure them a breakfast ' . The grammatical form bypasses the question of evidence , for the proposition we are asked to accept is self-evident : we can not disagree that it is no pleasant thing ' to experience the deprivations listed . But if the judgement seems mild , the rhetorical strategy is forceful , for the actuality of the labouring man 's frustration and suffering is assumed in the syntax . To be sure , the general propositions are followed by personal witness when Brownson assumes the role of historian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a place in the official histories , but if the chronicle of their wrongs is kept in heaven , in writing his articles he is acting as God 's agent . Though The Laboring Classes ' contains a bitter attack on the organized priesthood ? the hireling clergy ? as an ally of the rich in their enslavement of the poor , the rejection of all institutionalized religion goes with a high regard for the value of immediate religious experience . Accepting no religious authority , every man should speak out of his own full heart ' . Here Brownson is speaking out of his full heart and preaching a lay sermon . A Universalist minister himself from 1826 to 1830 , Brownson had joined the Unitarian Church in 1832 and had been invited to come to Boston as an independent preacher because his earlier association with the Working Men 's Party suggested that he would preach effectively to the labouring classes . In his 1840 articles , however , he preached to the middle class and shocked some of its members , among them Channing , who believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits that conditions in America are less severe than they are in many European countries , he does assert that death by starvation is no uncommon occurrence ' in his own land . The Panic of 1837 , in which hundreds of banks had failed and factories closed , had in fact brought misery to precisely the wage-dependent class with which the article is concerned , and had visibly affected the deserving poor who sought work . The rhetoric used to rouse our sympathy for the industrious poor is conventional enough , with its miserable pittance ' that is hardly sufficient to keep soul and body together ' , but once launched on his most subversive theme , the complicity of Christian society in social injustice , Brownson 's indignation produces language that is not hackneyed . His method is dramatic and his style denunciatory : there is a man who grows rich while the poor starve to increase his wealth . The present tense and the verbs in the singular make vivid the presence of exploiting hypocrisy among the respectable class of readers . In extending his attack  | to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed at length later in his article . Here he is content with a brief but bitter comment on the triumph of material over spiritual values . To accuse the rich employer would be to risk the charge of infidelity because the faith has become worship of mammon . If the priest loses his standing he will assuredly lose his salary , for he is himself an employee of the rich man . In the paragraph that follows the extract , Brownson takes his readers on a journey through the manufacturing villages of New England and takes Lowell as an example of the wage slavery that he considers no better than the chattel slavery of the South . By making Lowell his example of Northern industrial slavery , Brownson was deliberately challenging the pieties of Whig industrial paternalism , for Lowell had been planned as a showpiece of enlightened management . ' By the standards of the day , Lowell offered its employees something of the care that was lacking in the factory system as a whole . Housing , a hospital , a school , subsidized churches and even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lowell company , but in providing a total environment the mill-owners exercised complete control over the lives of their workers . With dividends at an average 12 per cent , investors did much better than employees , for by hiring women the company was able to pay lower wages than were paid to men by British employers at this time . The limits of paternalistic benevolence were plainly revealed in the employers ' resistance to demands for a ten-hour day and in the occasional enforcement of increased working rates . In treating the Lowell model ' as an example of wage-slavery , Brownson was insisting that any system based on the separation of labour from property was a form of wage-slavery . In attacking the Lowell system , Brownson incidentally offended the mill-hands , for his words on the factory girls seemed to suggest that they were morally degenerate . Rebuked in the pages of the Lowell Offering , Brownson replied with a letter to the factory girls in the pages of his own Boston Quarterly Review , assuring them that he had intended no defamation of their morals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the injustices they suffered ( BQR , iv . 261 ) . The misunderstanding in itself is instructive , for it indicates the weakness of Brownson 's rhetoric when he indulged his righteous indignation . But if the offence caused to the workers was the effect of a lack of control in Brownson 's prose , the outrages offered to the bourgeoisie in other parts of his article were anything but inadvertent . A reference early in the essay to the French Revolution as a glorious uprising of the people in behalf of their imprescriptible , and inalienable rights ' was calculated to offend all but the  | most radical American readers . It earned Brownson the title of the American Robespierre and led John Quincy Adams , the former president , to class him with the Marat-Democrats ' . Yet this was a mild assault on middle-class sensibility compared to the one prepared in the closing section , where Brownson argued that abolition of hereditary monarchy and nobility must be followed by abolition of hereditary property if social justice were ever to be achieved . The only effective way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove the economic privilege enshrined in the right to bequeath and inherit wealth . As long as there were gross inequalities in men 's fortunes when they began life , political equality would be meaningless . Moreover , since the rich would never consent to this disinheritance , force would have to be used . In his final paragraph , Brownson anticipated ' contumely and abuse ' for daring to broach such a subject and offered himself as a willing martyr , ready to die on the scaffold , for the cause of God and man . In his view , God 's cause was the cause of social justice . An article that began as a literary book review thus developed into a prophecy of doom , a socio-economic analysis of contemporary American society , an impassioned denunciation of the priesthood and all institutionalized churches as allies of the rich and exploitative classes , a challenge to the sacred institution of hereditary property , and a heroic assumption of the martyr 's role . Without impugning Brownson 's sincerity , we have to respond to his article as a literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roles and styles in order to have the maximum effect on his readers . Arthur Schlesinger , Jr , the most appreciative critic of the article , not only argues that it is probably the best study of society written by an American before the Civil War , but also claims a high place for it in revolutionary literature whether as analysis or polemic . " Since the two modes would normally be considered incompatible , Schlesinger 's appraisal is a tribute to Brownson 's skill in the use of his literary personae . In part , Brownson was following the example of the man whose book he was reviewing , for Carlyle himself adopted the roles of analyst , prophet and sage , but it is also true that for Brownson the review article was a form as free as the lyceum lecture was for Emerson . In the pages of the Boston Quarterly Review , Brownson discussed politics , philosophy , theology , literature and the relations of all these to man in society . In so doing , he conducted his own education in public , explored his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the judgements in The Laboring Classes ' sound peremptory , that is evidence of Brownson 's logical absolutism ? his thoroughgoing trust in the processes of logical thought ? but his  | motive for founding his own review was , as he was later to write in The Convert ( 1857 ) , not propaganda but enquiry . According to this later testimony , when he edited and wrote most of the articles for the Boston Quarterly Review he had no set views to promulgate . He plainly did have an intense need to explore ideas . The circulation of the Boston Quarterly Review was never large . In the four years of its existence its subscribers probably never numbered more than a thousand , but its influence was enough to cause the Democratic Party embarrassment in states as far away as Virginia . So unhelpful were Brownson 's radical reviews in The Laboring Classes ' to the campaign to re-elect Van Buren that George Bancroft felt the need to disown his friend 's opinions and stated in private that the Democrats were no more responsible for Brownson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , The Laboring Classes ' was more radical than almost anything else that Brownson wrote , but more important than any particular article was the mere existence of his review , for the Boston Quarterly was in itself a very interesting sign of the times . Brownson 's friend George Ripley , a Boston Unitarian Minister before he initiated the communitarian experiment at Brook Farm , wrote in the Transcendentalist magazine Dial to say that the Boston Quarterly was the best indication of the culture of philosophy ' in America . ' On reading the first number of the review , Henry David Thoreau wrote to tell Brownson that he was glad to find American thoughts ' expressed in it . He also made a comment that more than any other indicates the significance of Brownson 's review and of its editor 's career : I like the spirit of independence which distinguishes In the course of his attack on the priesthood in The Laboring Classes ' , Brownson defined the true mission of Christ on earth as a solemn summons . . . of the human race to freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main charge against the clergy was collusion with the rich , but he saw this as just one aspect of their enslavement of the free soul ' of man and their attempt to smother his etherial fire ' . As we have seen , when Brownson came to review Emerson 's Essays in 1841 , he picked out Self-Reliance ' as the one that offered the most important lesson for Americans ( BQR , Iv . 305 ) . This is hardly surprising , for freedom of thought was the cause to which he devoted himself with most energy in the years before his conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1844 . All the particular ideas that Brownson endorsed in those years related to , or were posited on , his belief in intellectual self-reliance . As far back as 1828 , when the radical Fanny Wright began to print some of Brownson 's articles in her Free Enquirer , it was his rejection of dogma and his  | uninhibited pursuit of free intellectual enquiry that earned him the respect of the celebrated champion of free thought . ' Just over ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the second volume of the Boston Quarterly Review ( 1839 ) , Brownson interpreted his whole life to that date in terms of liberty : I sucked in democracy with my mother 's milk ; I imbibed a feeling and a love of independence as I roamed over the Green Hills ' ( of Vermont ) . Since those childhood years , he added , he had always been found on the side of freedom in its widest signification ' ( BQR , II . 516 ) . Brownson 's defence of freedom of thought was not conducted only in the pages of his review . In May 1836 he preached at the Lyceum Hall , Boston , a sermon entitled The Wants of the Times ' , and so impressed the English reformer Harriet Martineau that she published his address as an appendix to her Society in America ( 1837 ) . In the sermon Brownson argued that to question , to reason , to think for oneself was to be a true Christian , not an infidel , and he claimed that the spirit of freedom was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own creed Brownson put free , unlimited inquiry , perfect liberty to enjoy and express one 's own honest convictions ' . In the New Church of which he dreamed , unlimited freedom of the mind ' would be acknowledged ; there would be no interdict on thought . 1836 was the year in which Emerson made his contribution to the Newness ' with the publication of Nature . Brownson 's declaration of intellectual independence came in his New Views of Christianity , Society , and the Church , which also appeared in that year . He had just founded the Society for Christian Union and Progress in Boston and regarded his book as an explanation of the principles of the society . In it he argued that all modern philosophy was founded upon the absolute freedom and independence of the individual reason ' , for the tendency of history since Luther 's time had been toward the most unlimited freedom of thought and conscience ' ( W , Iv . 20 ) . Inseparable from Brownson 's concern with freedom was his belief that humanity is engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stated as a law of human nature in Brownson 's book , plainly indicates the influence of William Ellery Channing , whom Brownson took to exemplify a distinctively American combination of intellectual freedom and faith in ideas ( p. 45 ) . The mission of the age , as Brownson saw it , was the reconciliation of spirit and matter , God and man ; this could only be achieved when the Augustinian tradition that , according to Brownson , demeaned human nature had been replaced by one that dignified man . Channing had  | offered an alternative to the doctrine of human depravity . From Channing , Brownson took over the doctrine of the at-onement ' of God and man , making it the essence of true Christianity . Six years after the publication of New Views , he published an article , The Church of the Future ' , in which he re-examined his first book and reaffirmed his belief in the potentiality of human nature . The incarnation of Christ still seemed to the Brownson of this 1842 article to proclaim the divinity of man , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of woman , and had thus become concreted in his works , a living God ' . Thus , though God was distinguishable from man , he was not separable from him ( W , Iv . 62 ) . Brownson 's belief in human progress was an expression of the spirit of the age that linked him with both Channing and Bancroft . The idea that humanity eternally aspires . It ever sees before it new heights to be scaled ' , and can never remain satisfied with what it has achieved because the ideal always hovers before it , was a Romantic commonplace by the time that Brownson expressed it in The Church of the Future ' in the Boston Quarterly Review . In one of the few articles contributed to the Review by writers other than its editor , On the Progress of Civilization ' , George Bancroft proclaimed his belief in the irresistible tendency of the human race to advancement ( BQR , I. 406 ) . Yet where Bancroft was satisfied to let the Democratic Party carry on the great cause of progress , Brownson believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergy to the cause of the common people . His anger with the hireling priests in The Laboring Classes ' was the reverse side of his hope for social reform through a clergy devoted to social justice . In his article The Education of the People ' in the Unitarian Christian Examiner in 1836 , Brownson argued that the priests had too long neglected the social mission of Christianity and had thus failed to play their part in the progress of the people ( vol. xx . 153-69 ) . In Charles Elwood , or The Infidel Converted , an autobiographical novel published in 1840 , Brownson 's central character makes a religion of social reform when he sees the plight of the poor . Developing the same trend of thought in The Laboring Classes ' , Brownson defined genuine Christianity as the religion that seeks to establish the kingdom of God on the earth instead of awaiting its fulfilment in heaven . Where Channing remained content with a somewhat imprecise belief that a higher form of Christianity would come in a socialist direction ' , 9 Brownson , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quarterly Review in October 1840 , left no doubt that it was the Christian 's duty to work for reform . The at-onement ' of God and man , the development of man 's divine  | potentiality that Channing hoped to realize through the spread of selfculture , was simply not to be achieved without social progress . As Brownson put it in his first Laboring Classes ' article , Self-culture is a good thing , but it can not abolish inequality . . . as constituting in itself a remedy for the vices of the social state , we have no faith in it ' ( BQR , III . 375 ) . By 1842 Brownson had a new enthusiasm and a new means of conceiving the union of God and man . In July of that year he reviewed Pierre Leroux 's De l'Humanite ( 1840 ) and once more triumphantly identified Christianity as the religion of humanity . Taking over Leroux 's doctrine that God and man were united in the life of Christ , Brownson combined a recognition of Christ 's mediatorial life ' with a claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteenth century was the French socialist Saint-Simon , whose theories he had used in his Laboring Classes ' analysis of society . Saint-Simon and his followers had understood better than any other Christians the social character of the new covenant God had made with man through Christ and had , in Brownson 's view , rightly made social progress their ideal . There is , however , an insistence on the role of religion in this review of ' Leroux 's Humanity ' that was obscured by the denunciation of the priesthood in The Laboring Classes ' . By 1842 Brownson was ready to admit the hopelessness of all efforts at reform that were not sustained by religion . Humanity , he now argued , could not be satisfied with intellectual speculation : it demanded a practical philosophy , and that meant a religion . In an open letter to Channing , The Mediatorial Life of Christ ' , published in June 1842 , Brownson fully explored the implications of Leroux 's ideas and went on to look closely at Channing 's conception of likeness ' as a familial relationship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Channing from any responsibility for the extravagancies of ego-theism that had shown themselves in Transcendentalism , Brownson now firmly denied that man was naturally divine . The divinity of man was , he asserted , not natural but superinduced upon his nature ' ( W , iv . 151 ) ; consequently , the child ? father likeness ' posited in Channing 's sermon could be misleading . Indeed , Brownson now argued that human nature was depraved before the divine was ' superinduced ' upon it , for experience plainly showed that man was by nature sinful . If this seemed closer to Calvinism than to the liberal Unitarianism of Channing , Brownson also announced his new belief that the life of Christ offered a mediation ' between man and God that was profoundly unlike the Calvinist notion of divine grace . Following  | Leroux , Brownson now claimed that man could achieve communion with God through Christ , for the life of Christ had given man access to God . The significant difference from Channing 's conception of human nature lay in Brownson 's acknowledgement that man could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finite could not communicate directly with the infinite . Brownson 's theological ideas were not separable from his social and political theories . The implications of his new conception of man 's relationship to God and his new awareness of human sinfulness were soon making themselves clear in his essays on the state of the nation . The defeat of the Democrats in the 1840 election meant that Brownson could no longer afford to maintain the Boston Quarterly Review , for he lost the political appointment as steward of the Chelsea Marine Hospital that Bancroft had found for him in 1838 , and with it went the income that had supported him . Accepting an offer from John L. O'Sullivan , Brownson next began to write as a contributing editor of the Democratic Review , and almost immediately began to shock and offend O'Sullivan 's readers . An article entitled Democracy and Liberty ' in the April 1843 issue of the Democratic Review caused O'Sullivan such embarrassment that he was obliged to add an editorial disclaimer to it . The Whig victory in the election had occasioned a revolution in Brownson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his article with the announcement that , since the election , he had lost all confidence in the intelligence of the people ' . A people so gullible that they could be swayed by the demagogic devices of the Whigs deserved only contempt , in Brownson 's opinion , and although he still claimed to be the champion of their cause , he announced that the doctrine of the virtue and intelligence of the people was mere humbug . The people , he went on , were not competent to govern themselves . Though the great goal was still freedom , an irrational enthusiasm for liberty was the great danger to liberty itself . Brownson 's new slogan was LIBERTY ONLY IN AND THROUGH ORDER ' , for it now seemed to him that Liberty without the guaranties of authority , would be the worst of tyrannies ' ( W , xv . 281 ) . The authority in which Brownson was now ready to put his trust was that of a constitutional party ' rather than a revolutionary party , as he made clear in a follow-up article , Popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic Review . The danger from the mob , stirred up by demagogues , was so great that a constitution was no defence against tyranny unless there were some power to guarantee the constitution . Brownson 's solution was one he found in the theories of John C. Calhoun , a Southern champion of states rights , for in the system of  | concurring majorities ' there seemed to be the only safeguard against the tyranny of popular rule . In fact , while writing for the Democratic Review , Brownson was secretly campaigning to get Calhoun the Democratic nomination in 1844 . Brownson 's volte-face on the subject of authority did not mean that he had thrown in his lot with the privileged classes , at least in his view of it . His articles for O'Sullivan 's Review continued to denounce the American system ' of protective tariffs as a means of enslaving the workers . Defending himself against the charge of apostasy , Brownson maintained that he no more trusted the virtue and intelligence of the mercantile and manufacturing employers than he did that of the proletarians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published in July 1843 , he reminded the readers of the Democratic Review of the starvation wages paid to labourers in America and of the need for bread and soup societies in Boston . He also reiterated his charge that the vicious ' injustice in distribution of the products of labour was the cause of surpluses and the unemployment they brought with them . Yet even here he stated plainly that Americans must be conservative , and study to preserve the order established by the wisdom of their fathers ' ( W , Iv . 432 ) . In countries where there was no hope of social progress through the machinery of government , violent revolution was inevitable , but it was not the best way of achieving the advancement of humanity , and in America it was not necessary . Renouncing all specific reforms , Brownson was now ready to substitute for them a vague call to the leaders of industry and finance to act altruistically . In the summer of 1843 Brownson prepared a series of articles under the title The Origin and Ground of Government ' for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's magazine could bear , for subscriptions were being cancelled as a direct result of Brownson 's articles . In the course of these long , rambling essays Brownson totally renounced any faith in popular sovereignty , arguing that the good man , and hence the good citizen , needed a sense of a power above him that he is bound to obey ' . Such a sense of a power higher and greater than that of the self was the origin of man 's feeling of LOYALTY ? he gave the word capitals ? and loyalty was the sum and substance of all virtue ' ( W , xv . 308 ) . Brownson 's devotion to the principle of intellectual and political independence here underwent a notable metamorphosis , for he defined civil and political liberty as freedom from all obligation to obey any commands but those of the legitimate sovereign ' ( p. 309 ) . Struggling to reach an adequate idea of true sovereignty , Brownson was clear enough about his rejection of  | self-reliance , Freedom from all but self-imposed restraints now seemed to him mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democracy and Liberty ' , Brownson had described the conduct of the individual who goes to jail rather than pay his taxes as merely anarchic ( W , xv . 276 ) . Three years later , his earlier admirer , Henry David Thoreau , would do exactly what Brownson now deplored . In 1843 the exemplary refusal to pay taxes was that of Amos Bronson Alcott , no less a champion of intellectual independence than Thoreau , if considerably less toughminded . Brownson 's political theorizing now put him worlds away from any of the Concord Transcendentalists . His reiterated conviction that some higher power , some greater authority , than the individual conscience was needed is in itself testimony to the strain imposed by the attempt to lead a life of intellectual self-reliance . To O'Sullivan 's relief , Brownson 's association with the Democratic Review came to an end with the publication of his articles on the theory of government . In January 1844 Brownson launched a new magazine with the title Brownson 's Quarterly Review and quickly set about reversing most of the theories he had expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave up his Society for Christian Union and Progress . In May he left the Unitarian Church and began to receive instruction in the Roman Catholic faith . On 19 October 1844 Brownson was received into the Church of Rome . An article in the April 1844 issue of his new Review carried the title No Church , No Reform ' and stated plainly that the fundamental vice of all modern schemes of reform ' is the false assumption that man is sufficient for his own redemption ' . With his new sense of man 's limitations went a revised conception of man 's capacity for progress . It now seemed to Brownson that man was progressive only by virtue of a wisdom and a power not his own ' . Talk of the divinity of man was , by the same token , mere prattle or Babel language , for man is divine only by the inflowings of divine efficacy ab extra ' ( W , iv . 507-9 ) . The insistence on a spiritual power beyond and above man parallels Brownson 's growing conviction that the individual must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political realm . The two strands of his thinking come together in an article entitled Come-outerism : or the Radical Tendency of the Day ' in the July 1844 issue of his Review . Designating the revolutionary spirit satanic ' , Brownson consigns Socialists and Associationists ( Robert Owen , Fourier , Saint-Simon ) and literary Romantics ( Byron , Shelley , Hugo , George Sand , Carlyle and even Balzac ) to the realms of the damned . The satanic spirit of come-outerism ' reveals itself , according to this article , in its assumption that the individual is his own judge ' .  | In America it is the result of the belief that government derives its power from the consent of the governed , for when such a belief is added to the Quaker doctrine of the Inner Light , the individual is credited with an authority that is mistakenly taken to be divine ( W , iv . 547 ? 57 ) . While the watchword of the young radical is Liberty ' , when he becomes the mature conservative his slogan will be Order ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms here , but the case is obviously his own . In Come-outerism ' , Brownson 's views are consistent with his Laboring Classes ' article in one respect : he treats the triumph of business interests under the Whig administration as part of the gradual but relentless subjection of the mass of the workers . In 1844 Brownson still considered reform to be the duty of all true Christians , though he was careful to add that reform must be achieved by conservative , not revolutionary , methods . Just two years later , in the article ' Schiller 's Aesthetic Theory ' , Brownson follows the implications of his new view of man further . Making a categorical distinction between man 's real good ; and his'external condition ' , he renounces all interest in reforms that aim to improve man 's condition in the world . The mistake of all socialists , he asserts , is to believe that man 's true good can be realized here on earth . To do so is to substitute love of man for love of God ; it is part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( W , xix. 127 ) . To treat Brownson as a radical democrat until 1844 , and to argue that his conversion to Roman Catholicism marks a complete break with his earlier intellectual life , is to simplify . In his Contradiction and Dilemma : Orestes Brownson and the American Idea , Leonard Gilhooley offers the most thorough study of Brownson 's writings up to 1859 and argues persuasively that there were conservative secondary emphases ' in Brownson 's thought as it was expressed in some of his earliest articles for the Boston Quarterly Review . In the first number of that Review ( January 1838 ) , and in the first article , Democracy ' , Brownson warned against the dangers of seeking progress by means of revolution and argued in favour of reform from within the established political system . The American people , he asserted , were not revolutionists but conservatives ; in America , to be a conservative was to be a democrat . Summing up his own position , he wrote : We would think with the radical , but often act with the conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this article , too , he rejected the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people because he saw in it the danger of tyranny . Absolute rule of the majority led to demagoguery and corruption , he argued , and this was before the fateful  | Whig victory in the 1840 election . But while acknowledging this important qualification of Brownson 's earlier enthusiasm for social change , we must also take note of the fact that his fear of absolute majority rule is occasioned by his jealous concern with individual liberty . In 1838 what he feared most was the disenfranchisement of the individual , and it must surely have been this element of Brownson 's thought that made Thoreau respond so warmly to the first issue of the Boston Quarterly Review . In Leonard Gilhooley 's apt formulation , the problem of tension between order and liberty would plague Brownson all his life ' .10 This was not merely Brownson 's problem , but the problem of his generation of American intellectuals . The very issue of his Review that carried his thoughts on democracy contained an article entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lockean epistemology and claimed that Reason is the true light , and it enlighteneth every man who cometh into the world . ' Spontaneous reason , he argued , was natural to all men ; consequently the true philosopher reverenced human nature and found in all men the elements of truth and virtue that were part of his own conscience ( W , t. 10 ? 18 ) . Dressing the theory of the Scottish Common Sense philosophers in the language of Coleridgean Reason , Brownson was here coming close to the New England Transcendentalists . In January 1839 Brownson reviewed Andrews Norton 's Evidence of the Genuineness of the Four Gospels ( 1838 ) , and gave his verdict on the doctrine that all God 's revelations to man had been made in the miracles recorded in the Bible , i.e. that God spoke to man only through certain authorized messengers . Such a doctrine , said Brownson , denied man all inherent power of attaining to truth and consequently destroyed all free action of the mind , all independent thought , all progress , and all living faith ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and vouch for the divinity of God , Norton 's doctrine was also politically unsound , for in rejecting the inner light ' in all men , Norton was undermining democratic faith in the ability of all men to act as their reason dictated , and thus to seek truth . In 1842 , when he reviewed his own Charles Elwood , Brownson took the word intuition ' ? the key term in the Transcendentalists ' rejection of Lockean empiricism ? and gave it a significant new interpretation . He defined it as looking on to ideas that were objects or realities ' rather than looking in , or looking within the self for truths . Absolute ideas are objective to the whole me ' and are therefore not me , existing out of the me , and independent of it ' , he now argued ( W , Iv . 336 ? 46 ) . Nothing could reveal more clearly his essential predicament . Wanting ?  | needing ? to maintain the independence of the self , he at the same time felt the necessity of looking beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The article Schmucker 's Psychology ' in the Democratic Review in this same year states that religion is always authoritative , always legislative ; it imposes the law ' ( W , t. 21 ) . By 1849 , in the article Authority and Liberty ' , he defined Christianity as an authoritative religion , an external revelation from God , given by the Supreme Lawgiver , and binding upon all men ( Essays and Reviews , p. 276 ) . By this time , the Church that represented the divine authority was , of course , the Roman Catholic Church ; the Reformation now seemed to Brownson to have meant the substitution of human sovereignty for the divine . In the preface to The Convert ( 1857 ) , he wrote : I . . . consider submission to the teaching of the church the noblest exercise I can make of my reason and free will ' ( W , v. 2 ) . The Convert , as its title suggests , tells the story of Brownson 's intellectual career from his youthful dismay at the God of terror preached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Roman Catholic Church . A complementary way of reviewing his career as a thinker is to glance at his changing attitudes to George Bancroft 's History of the United States . When he reviewed the early volumes in his Boston Quarterly in 1841 , Brownson thought the History a marvellous production ' because it expressed a profound belief in human progress and was given unity by Bancroft 's recognition that the idea of America was the idea of liberty , and the mission of America was the realization of that idea . At this stage , Brownson 's only reservation was a feeling that Bancroft 's trust in the collective will of the people made him careless of the dangers to individual liberty . Eleven years later , reviewing Bancroft 's History up to volume four ( 1852 ) , Brownson rejected the view of the American past it embodied as totally false , claiming that Bancroft 's theological , ethical and political theories had corrupted every aspect of his narrative . Bancroft 's great heresy , according to the Brownson of 1852 , was his belief that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that God speaks only in and through popular instincts and tendencies ' ( W , xtx. 388 ) . In this worship of humanity , Bancroft revealed his allegiance to the dominant idolatry or superstition of the age ' ( p. 411 ) . The story does not end here , for the Civil War stirred Brownson to a passionate intellectual defence of the Union and a rejection of his own earlier belief in states rights . Dedicating his The American Republic ( 1865 ) to Bancroft , as a sort of public atonement ' , Brownson now defined the mission of America as that of realizing the dialectic of authority and liberty ' .  | ' While still maintaining that loyalty is the highest of human emotions , Brownson here resolves his own difficulties concerning the nature of authority by arguing that civil rulers hold their authority from God ' yet through the people ' ( W , xvni. 68 ) . Though he did not waver in his faith as a Catholic , Brownson 's dedication to the idea of America led him to believe that sovereignty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Thus the man who had excoriated the Whig Party as the party of privilege in the 1840 election , when Abraham Lincoln had campaigned wholeheartedly for the Whigs and for Harrison , found in the Union a fusion of the secular and the sacred that Lincoln himself , for all his totally contrasting intellectual background , had discovered in the years leading to the Civil War .

Passing here and there a few scattered cabins , deserted or burnt to the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than twenty miles from their point of departure . Here , as at Carlisle , was gathered a starving multitude , who had fled from the knife and the tomahawk . Beyond lay a solitude whence every settler had fled . They reached Fort Loudon , on the declivity of Cove Mountain , and climbed the wood-encumbered defiles beyond . Far on their right stretched the green ridges of the Tuscarora ; and , in front , mountain beyond mountain was piled against the sky . Over rocky heights and through deep valleys , they reached at length Fort Littleton , a provincial post , in which , with incredible perversity , the government of Pennsylvania had refused to place a garrison . Not far distant was the feeble little post of the Juniata , empty like the other ; for the two or three men who held it had been withdrawn by Ourry . On the twentyfifth of July , they reached Bedford , hemmed in by encircling mountains . It was the frontier village and the centre of a scattered border population , the whole of which was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighboring woods were full of prowling savages . Ourry reported that for several weeks nothing had been heard from the westward , every messenger having been killed and the communication completely cut off . By the last intelligence Fort Pitt had been surrounded by Indians , and daily threatened with a general attack . At Bedford , Bouquet had the good fortune to engage thirty backwoodsmen to accompany him . He lay encamped three days to rest men and animals , and then , leaving his invalids to garrison the fort , put out again into the sea of savage verdure that stretched beyond . The troops and convoy defiled along the road made by General Forbes in 1758 , if the name of road can be given to a rugged track , hewn out by axemen through forests and swamps and up the steep acclivities of rugged  | mountains ; shut in between impervious walls of trunks , boughs , and matted thickets , and overarched by a canopy of restless leaves . With difficulty and toil , the wagons dragged slowly on , by hill and hollow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stumps . Nature had formed the country for a war of ambuscades and surprises , and no pains were spared to guard against them . A band of backwoodsmen led the way , followed closely by the pioneers ; the wagons and the cattle were in the centre , guarded by the regulars ; and a rear guard of backwoodsmen closed the line of march . Frontier riflemen scoured the woods far in front and on either flank , and made surprise impossible . Thus they toiled heavily on till the main ridge of the Alleghanies , a mighty wall of green , rose up before them ; and they began their zigzag progress up the woody heights amid the sweltering heats of July . The tongues of the panting oxen hung lolling from their jaws ; while the pine-trees , scorching in the hot sun , diffused their resinous odors through the sultry air . At length from the windy summit the Highland soldiers could gaze around upon a boundless panorama of forest-covered mountains , wilder than their own native hills . Descending from the Alleghanies , they entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but beset with constantly increasing dangers . On the second of August , they reached Fort Ligonier , about fifty miles from Bedford , and a hundred and fifty from Carlisle . The Indians who were about the place vanished at their approach ; but the garrison could furnish no intelligence of the motions and designs of the enemy , having been completely blockaded for weeks ... . On the morning of the fifth , the tents were struck at an early hour , and the troops began their march through a country broken with hills and deep hollows , covered with the tall , dense forest , which spread for countless leagues around . By one o'clock , they had advanced seventeen miles ; and the guides assured them that they were within half a mile of Bushy Run , their proposed resting-place . The tired soldiers were pressing forward with renewed alacrity , when suddenly the report of rifles from the front sent a thrill along the ranks ; and , as they listened , the firing thickened into a fierce , sharp rattle ; while shouts and whoops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance guard was hotly engaged . The two foremost companies were at once ordered forward to support it ; but , far from abating , the fire grew so rapid and furious as to argue the presence of an enemy at once numerous and resolute . At this , the convoy was halted , the troops formed into line , and a general charge ordered . Bearing down through the forest with fixed bayonets , they drove the yelping assailants before them , and swept  | the ground clear . But at the very moment of success , a fresh burst of whoops and firing was heard from either flank ; while a confused noise from the rear showed that the convoy was attacked . The Conspiracy of Pontiac ( 1851 ; rev. 1870 ) ' Colonel Bouquet 's little army ' is moving along the Cumberland Valley in July 1763 to repulse the hitherto victorious Indians who , under their bold leader Pontiac , have attacked and besieged the lonely English outpost of Fort Pitt , two hundred miles west of the main line of settlements , have captured most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have terrorized the frontiers of Pennsylvania , Maryland and Virginia . The panic-stricken frontiersmen have poured into the town of Carlisle , leaving behind them their burned farms and crops with , in many cases , the bodies of relatives slaughtered by Indian raiding parties . Bouquet 's force , consisting of less than five hundred men , is marching into a vast wilderness inhabited now only by their savage enemies . The immense mountain ranges that confront the advancing troops and hem in the outlying settlement of Bedford seem in this extract to offer resistance to the westward movement of the white men and to threaten those whites who dare to enter their precincts . The forests not only shelter and conceal the savage enemy , they encumber ' the defiles through which the army must pick its laborious way as it struggles over rocky heights and through deep valleys ' . The woods , like the mountains , seem almost to be malevolent in their resistance . With the settlers turned into terrified refugees , and the messengers of the English all intercepted by the Indians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . White expansion on the western frontiers has been checked ; the mountains and forests have been returned to the red men . In the second paragraph , the phrase sea of savage verdure ' develops the implication that the forest and the Indian are one in their resistance to the troops . The word savage ' derives , as Francis Parkman and Henry David Thoreau both knew , from the Latin silva ( ' woods ' ) ; it contains in its etymology a key to the significance of the American Indian for both writers . In the earliest version of this passage , published in the first edition of The Conspiracy of Pontiac in 1851 , Parkman had written that the whole country lay buried in foliage ' and that the unbroken forest , like a vast garment , invested the whole ' . In the revisions for the text of the 1870 edition quoted here , Parkman has not merely replaced some  | cliched phrases , he has expressed a deeper awareness of his own theme . The fact that the road on which the army travelled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forbes 's expedition five years earlier is not mentioned in the first version of this passage . Its inclusion accentuates the violent effort needed to make even a rugged track ' through the forests , whose tree-trunks , boughs and matted thickets continue to resist the progress of the forces of civilization . Three pairs of nouns , one abstract ( ' difficulty and toil ' ) and two concrete ( hill and hollow . . . brook and quagmire ' ) , represent the accumulating obstacles and lead to the triple resistance of roots , rocks , and stumps ' . Consonants cluster and impede forward movement of the prose as the unyielding terrain opposes the convoy . When we are told : Nature had formed the country for a war of ambuscades and surprises ' ( for Indian warfare , in fact ) , we are ready to take the implication that nature is as purposively malevolent as the Indian . The mighty wall of green ' formed by the main ridge of the Alleghenies opposes the westward advance of Bouquet 's army just as it has resisted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This green ' is no emblem of pastoral innocence , for we already know that the woods are full of prowling savages ' ? men who are as predatory , in the mind of the English , as the wild beasts who hunt in the wilderness . Bouquet 's march was an historical fact , not a literary invention . Parkman is drawing on source materials for his information , but his conception of the historian 's role , like Bancroft 's , involved breathing life into his materials , so the vivid sensory details he provides in the lolling tongues of the oxen and the strong resinous smell of the pine trees in the intense heat are , in his view , legitimate means of recreating the past . Here , as throughout The Conspiracy of Pontiac , Parkman 's endeavour is to make his readers feel what his historical characters felt , to make them experience the moments of drama . In that endeavour , Parkman was able to employ what his best critic has aptly called his uncanny sympathy with all forms of physical movement ' , 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of national and racial conflict . The actual Highland soldiers of the 42nd Regiment who marched with Bouquet can hardly be supposed to have thought of boundless panoramas ' , but we can feel with them the relief of the windy summit ' after the suffocatingly sultry air ' of the forest . As the troops march through the tall dense forest , which spread for countless leagues around ' , they are attacked by the Indians who have been lying in ambush close to a small stream called Bushy Run . In his account of the battle that follows , according to Parkman one of the  | most fiercely fought encounters ever to take place between Indians and white men , we are to some extent detached observers , watching the English regulars charge with the bayonet to drive the Indians from the concealed positions from which they have been harassing the regulars with accurate rifle-fire ; but we are taken closer to the wounded soldiers in the surrounded camp , as they lie on the ground enduring agonies of thirst ' and anticipating a horrible fate if their comrades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the British defensive perimeter is weakening and the troops , maddened by the torments of thirst ' , know themselves in danger of being overrun and annihilated , the full terror of the predicament is brought home by a description , not of the soldiers ' feelings , but of the frantic behaviour of the horses in the camp , maddened by the bullets and the war-whoops of the Indians . The day is saved and the Indians routed only by the skill of Colonel Bouquet , who feigns a retreat , lures the Indians to the attack and , with a cunning that rivals that of his enemy , launches a countercharge by men hidden on the Indians ' flank . The men who charge are the Highlanders , who fall on their enemy with the bayonet and with yells as wild as their the Indians ' own ' . Earlier in the volume , in an account of the British attack on Ticonderoga in 1758 , Parkman wrote of the Highlanders screaming with rage ' as they hewed at the branches of trees impeding their charge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 123 ) . To Parkman , the Highlanders ' blood-lust is one of many indications that the line between savagery and civilization is a shifting one . In the battle of Bushy Run , the British win by excelling the Indians in both cunning and ferocity . When he began to work on the book that became The Conspiracy of Pontiac , Parkman 's intention was , as he wrote in a letter to a friend in 1845 , to make something like a biography ' of the famous Ottawa chief ' ( L , i. 31 ) . He was interested , he said , in every aspect of the Indian War of 1763-4 , but especially in Pontiac . However , finding that little information about the chief 's life was available , Parkman decided to give a detailed account of the causes , progress and results of the war chiefly with the view of exhibiting the traits of the Indian character ' . Four years later , Parkman wrote to another friend to say that he had been interested for some time in writing a general history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his researches to the uprising of the northern tribes against the English after the collapse of the French in  | Canada . Here , too , he states that the events of the war afford an admirable opportunity of representing Indian manners and character ' ( L , i. 62 ) . The book Parkman actually wrote is less about the Indian character than about Indian violence and treachery , as the white man saw them . In fact , the violence in The Conspiracy is not limited to the pitched battles between Indians and English and the devastating Indian raids on forts and settlements , for in an early chapter , The Collision of the Rival Colonies , 1700-55 ' , Parkman anticipates some of his later works on the conflict between France and England in the New World , and tells the gory tale of General Braddock 's disastrous defeat by French and Indian forces at Fort du Quesne in 1755 , the fierce fighting at Lake George , at Ticonderoga , and the great battle of Quebec in 1759 . In terms of the Indian conspiracy , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British garrison of Michillimackinac in June 1763 , for this episode demonstrates both Indian guile ( the troops are massacred as they watch a supposedly friendly game of lacrosse ) and Indian brutality ( most of the garrison are butchered and scalped , and the warriors drink the blood of their victims ) . But this climax occurs at the end of the first volume of the two-volume edition ; in the second volume the violence is not always initiated by the Indians and , as we shall see , the savages are not always red men . In the preface to the first edition of The Conspiracy , Parkman stated that he aimed to portray the American forest and the American Indian at the period when both received their final doom ' . The way in which this identification of the forest with the Indian affected the narrative has already been glanced at , but to understand its full significance for Parkman we have to turn to his opening chapter , Indian Tribes East of the Mississippi ' . It begins with the statement : The Indian is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wastes and solitudes of nature are his congenial home . ' It goes on , drawing on H. R. Schoolcraft 's Oneota , J. G. E. Heckewelder 's History of the Indian Nations , J. F. Lafitau 's Mceurs des sauvages ameriquains , the Relations of several French Jesuit missionaries to the Canadian Indians in the seventeenth century , and other authorities on the subject , to give a brief account of Indian life and Indian beliefs . Pouring scorn on rhapsodic and sentimental versions of the Indian character , Parkman prides himself on a realistic estimate of the limitations of the red man and points to the strange mixture of invincible pride and abject beggary that characterize his dealings with the white man . In its main conclusions , Parkman 's judgement follows the common savagist ' prejudices of his age , deciding that the Indian is  | doomed to extinction because his fixed and rigid quality ' makes it impossible for him to learn the arts of civilization . One manifestation of Indian inflexibility that Parkman 's authorities had noted was the resistance to Christianity : the refusal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of the numerous deities of traditional Indian religion . Sharing the dismissive attitude of his contemporaries , Parkman asserts that the religious belief of all the hunting tribes of America is a cloudy bewilderment , where we seek in vain for system or coherency ' ( i. 39 ) , while their understanding of moral good and evil are perplexed and shadowy ' . But he does recognize that to the Indian mind , all nature was instinct with deity . A spirit was embodied in every mountain , lake , and cataract ; every bird , beast , or reptile , every tree , shrub , or grassblade , was endued with mystic influence . ' To Parkman , this is ' untutored pantheism ' and no more than an arrested stage of religious development , but its implications for the Indian 's relationship with nature emerge in important ways throughout the book . By the time he wrote The Jesuits in North America ( 1867 ) , Parkman knew more about the Iroquois than he had when working on The Conspiracy . In the later work he stresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the natural world , for he finds in that awareness the explanation of the Indian 's need to propitiate the spirit of any animal he must kill for food . In The Conspiracy , turning from his survey of the bloody conflict between France and England in the New World between 1700 and 1755 , Parkman describes The Wilderness and Its Tenants at the Close of the French War , 1755 ? 1763 ' ( ch. v ) . Here the initial assertion that the Indian is the true child of the forest and the desert ' and is at home in the wilderness returns in a striking form . A vivid passage shows us the nursling of civilization ' , the citybred white man , hopelessly lost in the labyrinth of the forest , wandering bewildered and amazed ' until he dies of hunger and despair . In the forest the civilized man is helpless as an infant ' ( i. 159 ) and the places on the scale of maturity are dramatically reversed . The white backwoodsman , having learned from the Indian , can eventually excel him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that subtlety of sense , more akin to the instinct of brutes than to human reason ' that enables the red man to read the meaning of the great world of nature ' ( i. 159-60 ) . The pejorative implications of this judgement are consistent with Bancroft 's account of the Indian in his chapter The Aborigines East of the Mississippi ' in the third volume of his History ( 1839 ) . Bancroft had moved from a recognition that the Indian saw spirits in every concrete particular of the natural world to the conclusion  | that he lacked the power to conceive an absolute substance ' or a self-existent ' deity . The Indian 's deficiency , as Bancroft understood it , was a lack of imagination and a lack of the faculty of abstraction to lift himself out of the dominion of his immediate experience ' ( III . 285 , 302 ) . Thus the red man was , like the animals , the prisoner of his senses and was so close to nature that we may call them savage , just as we call fruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time , more generous to the Indian than Parkman , insisting that he was also a man , with sufficient moral sense to feel keenly the abuse of his white dispossessor , but though he could explain the Indian 's wildness , Bancroft could not project his own imagination into the Indian 's relationship with nature as Parkman , for all his prejudices and limitations , so feelingly could . Parkman 's prejudices were those of the highly privileged nursling of civilization ' who belonged to the Brahmin caste of early nineteenthcentury Boston . Born in 1823 , son of the Reverend Dr Francis Parkman , who was a disciple of William Ellery Channing and minister of the New North Church in Boston , he was , in the words of his biographer , born to the purple and with a golden spoon in his mouth ' .3 He was born , in fact , in the family home on Beacon Hill , the most socially desirable area of Boston , and was to live there all his life . But the young Francis Parkman reacted against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took no interest in the familyendowed chair at the Divinity School . Parkman first experienced the thrill of contact with the wilderness as a boy , between the ages of eight and thirteen , while holidaying at Five Mile Woods ( later Middlesex Fells ) at Medford , a wilderness only eight miles from the heart of Boston . In 1841 , while a freshman at Harvard , he took a vacation trip to the White Mountains and indulged his desire for adventure by climbing a dangerous avalanche ravine and then exploring the deep forest of what was still the sparsely settled New Hampshire frontier around Lake Umbagog . As early as his sophomore year , Parkman knew what his lifelong interest as an historian would be , for in April 1842 he wrote to Jared Sparks , McLean Professor of History at Harvard , asking for information about the military operations around Lake George at the time of the Seven Years War . In the same year , unable to carry out a proposed visit to Mount Katandin in the Maine wilderness , he visited Lake George , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's interest had been stimulated by reading Fenimore Cooper 's Last of the  | Mohicans , but he typically sought firsthand experience of the wilds and personal contact with the past . While on this excursion he had the good fortune to meet a certain Captain Patchin , a veteran of the Indian campaigns near Fort Stanwix , and so could gather information from a participant in the story he was determined to tell . These early trips taught Parkman what he was to know of forest and river travel . He depended on them for his understanding of the great explorers La Salle and Champlain in the histories he was to write , for he always liked to work from his own experience when he attempted to recreate the past . His fascination with the wild began , in Parkman 's own account , when he was no more than fifteen or sixteen . Writing about his own past in a letter of 1864 and talking of himself in the third person , Parkman told a friend that at an early age he was seized by a passion for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the literary pursuits to which he was also addicted ' ( L , I. 176 ) . The word addicted ' is , of course , revealing ; even more so is the statement in the same letter that the passion for the woods was still , in 1864 , but half gratified ' . In his own words , Parkman 's thoughts were always in the forests , whose features , not unmixed with softer images , possessed his waking and sleeping dreams , filling him with vague cravings impossible to satisfy ' ( p. 177 ) . Characteristically , he follows this admission with an account of the damage he had done to his health by reckless disregard for it on his excursions into the forest and then goes on to recommend the strenuous life as a remedy for the pallid and emasculate scholarship of which New England has had too many examples ' . When we find Parkman advising hours in the saddle and on the hunt as a tonic for the pale student ' , it is not difficult to see why Theodore Roosevelt dedicated The Winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Always contemptuous of mental and spiritual culture that went with physical weakness , and always a believer in the virtues of physical toughness and courage , after 1846 Parkman was plagued by psychosomatic maladies that made him an invalid and thus denied him the life of heroic action he desired . Unable to take part in either the Mexican War or the Civil War , he could give expression to his yearning for adventure only in his writings . His illness first took the form of a weakness of the eyes that confined him to a darkened room and made reading and writing virtually impossible for long periods . This impediment to his studies was not all he had to endure , for with the condition of his eyes went a mental disorder that Parkman described as a strange undefined torture ' . Both conditions seem to have been aggravated by his passion for his historical studies , though Parkman believed that his  | nervous system had been abnormal from birth . To complete his misery , he was crippled by water on the knee and confined to indoor life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the winter of 1845 ? 6 while he worked with furious intensity on the history of Pontiac 's conspiracy . It was partly with the intention of resting his eyes that he embarked on the great adventure of his life : his Oregon Trail excursion in the spring and summer of 1846 , a trip that had its climax in some weeks spent with a wandering band of completely untamed Oglala Sioux who had had scarcely any contact with the white man . His prime motive in making the expedition , as he recalled it in his autobiographical letter of 1864 , was to gain an inside view of Indian life ' because the knowledge was essential for his literary plans . In the autobiographical letter , more than in the book that resulted from the expedition , Parkman stressed his physical infirmity at the time ? reeling in the saddle with weakness and pain ' , he made the arduous journey over hundreds of miles of rough country in search of the Sioux , and when he had found them he had to conceal his weakness or risk provoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , he found the rigours of the buffalo hunt a tonic ' and exerted himself even more than was necessary to earn the respect of the Indians . His policy and his creed was , as the letter makes plain , to combat his physical ailments by forcing himself to violent and dangerous effort . In his words , to tame the devil , it is best to take him by the horns ' . The original subtitle of the book that became The Oregon Trail was A Summer 's Journey Out of Bounds ' .4 Nothing could more clearly point to Parkman 's motivation . In language uncannily close to Thoreau 's account of extra-vagance ' ( see pp. 145 , 149 ) , this scion of Brahminical stock reveals his own intense need to go beyond the bounds of the culture in which he firmly and consistently believes with his conscious mind . The most obvious means of escaping the physical confines of Bostonian culture was to go West . The most vivid contrast to the spiritual culture of the Reverend Dr Channing , whose disregard of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was provided by the wild life of the completely uncivilized tribe . The great Sioux warrior Mahto-Tatonka , whom Parkman met at the Oglala camp , was limbed like an Apollo in bronze ' and rode in triumph , his head-dress crested with eagle 's feathers , his round white shield hanging at his breast , his quiver at his back , tall lance in his hand , with the scalplocks of his enemies fluttering from the shaft . Balancing with graceful buoyancy to the free movements of his war horse ' , he seemed to  | Parkman to be as gorgeous as a champion in panoply ' as he rode within the great ring of lodges , watched by the whole admiring village , and sang his song to the Great Spirit before leaving on the war path . To see the Indian as a Greek god in physique and a medieval champion in military prowess is , of course , to dignify him as much as any Romantic could , but Parkman undercuts his own description in the interests of realism : Yet , after all , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sun before our tent , kicking his heels in the air and cracking jokes with his brother . Does he look like a hero ? ' Repeatedly in The Oregon Trail , Parkman paints the Indian in scenes that are striking and picturesque beyond description ' , giving his readers glimpses of the savage multitude , the armed warriors , the naked children , the gaily apparelled girls ' moving impetuously through the mountains , or the warriors sitting on horseback , savage figures , with quivers at their backs , and guns , lances , or tomahawks in their hands . . . motionless as statues , their arms crossed on their breasts and their eyes fixed in a steady unwavering gaze ' on the white men . Selfconsciously stressing the aesthetic qualities of such scenes , he invokes the spirit of the favourite painter of the Gothic novelists , Salvator , or the most distinguished writer of historical romances , Sir Walter Scott , as appropriate to his sublime and noble subjects . But just as he both celebrated and demeaned the leading warrior of the tribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life the boredom , emptiness , futility of their daily round , and insists on the squalid confusion of their life in camp . The old Sioux women are . ' hideous ' ; round the blazing camp-fire flit withered , witch-like hags ' . Even the warriors behave like ungoverned children inflamed with the fiercest passions of men ' when they are sold whisky by the white emigrants who pass them en route for Oregon . When he came to write of The Jesuits in North America ( 1867 ) , Parkman portrayed with feeling the predicament of the cultivated missionary Le Jeune amid the hardship , famine , filth , wickedness ' of a Huron camp ; clearly , he was again drawing on his own memories . The hunting life , as Parkman knew , could reduce the tribe that followed it to the misery and degradation ' he described in The Jesuits . In his explicit judgements on the Plains Indians in The Oregon Trail , Parkman writes with the condescension and contempt of a highly civilized white man who regards the savages as the living representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all , his book would be no more than a rather clumsily wrought and self-consciously literary ' travelogue , with the fortuitous historical interest lent by the fact that its writer took part , more or less as a tourist , in the great westward migration to  | Oregon in the 1840s . But the main interest of The Oregon Trail lies less in its evocations of the sublime scenery of the Rocky Mountains and the occasional glamour of the Indians of the high plains than in the curiously indefinite narrative stance of the author . Angrily rebuffing the crude inquisitiveness of the proletarian emigrants he meets on his journey , the I ' of the book does not announce his real motive for the trip until he is a third of the way through his story ; and even then his language is ambiguous . Hearing of a projected Sioux war-party against the Snake tribe , he says I was greatly rejoiced to hear of it . I had come into the country chiefly with a view of observing the Indian character . To accomplish my purpose it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become , as it were , one of them . ' The unashamed delight at the prospect of Indian warfare casts an interesting light on the narrator 's role as amateur ethnographer . More significant still is the phrase become , as it were , one of them ' . Of course no Bostonian of the Brahmin caste could seriously propose to become one of the savages any more than he could identify with the coarse , uncultivated white emigrants who were about to sweep the Sioux to extinction , yet he does become one of them ' as he experiences the thrill of the buffalo hunt , and thus , as his letter of 1864 has it , feels the tonic ' that revives his failing health and spirits . The joy and exhilaration of the chase is ultimately the joy of the kill , with the added grace that it is a socially sanctioned death-dealing . Parkman did not kill buffalo for food or materials as the Sioux did ; he killed for pleasure , and in this , as in his ' motormindednessi5 and part of his style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hemingway 's career and some characteristics of his writings . The chapter entitled The Hunting Camp ' ( ch. 15 ) is one of the most exciting in Parkman 's book . At the end of the preceding chapter , the narrator tells that , ill as he was , there was something very animating in the prospect of the general hunt ' the next day . When the hunt begins , Parkman leaves camp with a philosophic resolution ' to remain a spectator , because neither he nor his horse are fit for such sport ' ; but amid the furious movement of the hunt he finds it impossible to sit still , so he drives his exhausted mount to within yards of a desperate buffalo and shoots it in the neck . Returning to the lodge of his Indian host , he falls asleep as quickly as his savage friend who is smeared to the elbows with blood . When he eats the rich , juicy hump-ribs of a slain buffalo cow , against all medical experience ' he finds that this solid fare agrees with him admirably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never would in conscious thought .  | Less dramatic but no less revealing than The Hunting Camp ' is an incident recorded at the end of A Mountain Hunt ' ( ch. 18 ) . Climbing a mountain alone , Parkman comes , unobserved , across the Indian MeneSeela seated alone , immovable as a statue , among the rocks and trees ' . Without announcing his presence , Parkman observes the old Indian for a long time , deciding that he was engaged in an act of worship , or prayer , or communion of some kind with a supernatural being ' . Knowing that to the Indian all nature is instinct with mystic influence ' , Parkman longs to penetrate his thoughts ' , but has to rest content with speculation . Perhaps Mene-Seela finds his guardian spirit in the old pinetree at which he stares , for to the Indian it is usually embodied in the form of some living thing : a bear , a wolf , an eagle or a serpent ' . The white man can not penetrate this mystery , but when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to climb and feels a strange strength and elasticity of limb ' . Earlier in the narrative , Parkman has written of his desire to penetrate ' the hidden recesses ' of the Black Mountains in a sentence whose syntax could make those recesses belong to the minds of the Indians ' as well as the mountains . Earlier , too , he has noted the wonderfully cheering and exhilarating effect ' of the proximity of mountains and rushing streams . In this curiously voyeuristic episode in A Mountain Hunt ' , we must surely credit Parkman with an awareness that he is here , as in an earlier chapter with an apt title , Hunting Indians ' to bring back a spiritual bounty that his system of conscious values can not acknowledge . The true child of the forest and the desert ' described in the first chapter of The Conspiracy of Pontiac has a mind imbued with the spirit of the wilderness ' . That spirit gives to the Indian an unruly pride and untamed freedom ' that are in harmony with the lonely mountains , cataracts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of freedom the mainspring of the Indian character , Parkman is following an already well-established nineteenth-century tradition . De Tocqueville , in a chapter on the coloured races in Democracy in America ( vol. ' , ch. 18 ) , had contrasted the submissive self-abnegation of the Negro slave with the spirit of utter defiance of white civilization shown by the Indian , who loved his savage life and maintained it as the distinguishing mark of his race . Bancroft , the propagandist for White Anglo-Saxon Protestant liberty , noted in his History ( vol. ttt , p. 275 ) , that The wild man hates restraint , and loves to do what is right in his own eyes ' , but  | saw no generic link between white liberty and savage rejection of all law . Parkman 's Indian abhors restraint , and owns no other authority than his own capricious will ' ( i. 2 ) . His spirit of freedom is devalued by repeated association with childishness and with instinctual animal behaviour , for Parkman intends to follow Bancroft in the firm demarcation of savage and civilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he finds it in the materials of his history and in himself . In the first chapter of The Conspiracy , the blood-besmeared ' Iroquois roam like wolves ' among the burning settlements of French Canada . Later , as Pontiac and his braves attempt to enter Fort Pitt as friends and then to butcher the garrison , their eyes are like those of rattlesnakes ' ( . 225 ) ; when captured , a savage is no more entitled to quarter than an entrapped wolf ' . David Levin and Harvey Wish both argue that Parkman is writing of the Indian in the manner of the Puritan historian when he uses this bestial imagery , ' but no Puritan historian had anything like Parkman 's sympathetic response to the wild . When Parkman says that the great mass of Indians who joined Pontiac 's conspiracy turned against their enemies with as little reason or forecast as a panther when he leaps at the throat of the hunter ' ( i. 185 ) , he is emphasizing his view that the Indians were driven to desperation by the ceaseless encroachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , he is giving a specific application to his theory of the Indian : spontaneous , acting on instinct and without reflection , the savage is a wild animal , acting in perfect freedom of impulse . Writing of the Canadian fur-trade in the second chapter of The Conspiracy , Parkman explains that it produced a class of restless bushrangers more akin to Indians than to white men ' ( p. 49 ) . He goes on : Those who had once felt the fascination of the forest were unfitted ever after for a life of quiet labor ; and with this spirit the whole colony of French Canada was infected . ' The pejorative connotations of unfitted ' and infected ' are obvious ? as always the verdict is a harsh one ? but the passage shows some understanding of the infection ' , for Parkman , as we have seen , had felt the fascination . Of the hunters , traders and scouts who ranged the woods beyond the borders of the English settlements in the 1760s , Parkman writes that they formed a connecting link between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' are still to be found in the 1850s , he adds , for the lonely trapper ' climbs the perilous defiles of the Rocky Mountains ' in Parkman 's imagination even as he writes . The trapper 's life is rigorous and dangerous , yet his wild , hard life has resistless charms ' ( i. 159 ) .  | One of the most vividly imagined scenes in The Conspiracy is the return , in November 1764 , of the prisoners captured by the Delawares and Shawanoes . In a note , Parkman first tells the story of Mary Jemison , a white woman captured by the Senecas and twice married to members of the tribe , who hid in the woods to avoid being returned to civilization and never lost her attachment to the Indian life ' ( It . 233 ) , though she lived to an advanced age . He goes on to tell of the many returned prisoners who bitterly resented being forced to abandon the wild license of the forest for the irksome restraints of society ' . Their recalcitrance , he explains , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound and healthful mind ' has felt civilization to be flat and stale ' when it has experienced the reckless independence , the haughty self-reliance , the sense of irresponsible freedom , which the forest life engenders ' ( It . 237 ) . After such freedom , the pleasures of civilized life are insipid , its pursuits wearisome , its conventionalities , duties , and mutual dependence alike tedious and disgusting ' . Though Parkman is speaking on behalf of the entrapped wanderer ' , there can be no doubt that such a wanderer is entrapped in Parkman 's self . His path ' , we are told , was choked with difficulties , but his body and soul were hardened to meet them ; it was beset with dangers , but these were the very spice of his life , gladdening his heart with exulting self-confidence , and sending the blood through his veins with a livelier current ' ( p. 238 ) . What can this be but a vicarious portrait of the historian of the wilderness ? It is followed by a passage , in deplorably overblown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert , mountain and storm to the grand and heroic ' spirit in man . Yet Parkrnan saw himself as the historian of progress ' in Bancroft 's sense of the term . As the defeated and doomed Pontiac skirts Lake Erie ( It . 300 ) , our attention is turned from the bleak wilderness to the amazing scene that will shortly appear when commerce works its transformation . Cities and townships will fill the empty waste , and sails will cover the formerly empty waters . When Pontiac is murdered after the failure of his conspiracy , a great city ( St Louis ) rises over his unmarked grave and the race whom he hated with such burning rancor trample in 1851 and thereafter with unceasing footsteps ' over that grave ( p. 313 ) . Commercial development and great cities are , to the nineteenth-century American historian , indisputably signs of a desired march of human progress , yet when Parkman earlier turned his gaze from the beautiful , unspoiled landscape around Fort Pitt in 1759 to the city that grew from its ruins , he saw warehouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black volumes of smoke ' ( II . 3 ) . As a young man on his  | 1841 expedition to the White Mountains and Lake Winnepesaukee , Parkman had deplored the ugliness of a disgusting little manufacturing village ' ( J , t. 9 ) . In his La Salle and the Discovery of the Great West ( 1878 ; first published as The Discovery of the Great West in 1869 , then revised and retitled ) Parkman noted that the Indian paintings on the rocks above Alton had been replaced by an advertisement for Plantation Bitters when he visited the spot in 1867 . He also recorded , in the same book , that the great natural beauty of Minneapolis had been spoiled utterly by two banks and an opera house , while St Anthony had been ruined by a university and a huge spa . Opera houses and universities ? if not banks ? should have set the seal of civilization on the former wilderness ; in Parkman 's view they destroyed what he most admired : the natural sublime . Parkman 's introduction to his Pioneers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next book after The Conspiracy , begins as if to follow the Bancroft pattern . New England stands for liberty and the spirit of reform ; New France represents the spirit of absolutism and is the champion of Roman Catholic reaction against human progress . With the political freedom nurtured in New England goes the material progress that , as in Bancroft 's History , depends on freedom ; in the English settlements every man can advance his fortunes by industry . But even in this opening statement Parkman begins to move away from the scheme of values he has inherited from his eminent predecessor , for he admits that the material progress of New England culture brings with it social conformism , that it is essentially unheroic , and that it produces no great personalities . Reactionary though it is , French culture in the New World gives full scope to the heroic spirit in its aristocracy and produces great men of the stature of Champlain . Soon we find that the bigotry and tyranny of the Roman Catholic Church are represented by Spain rather than France , and attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Philip II is the ultimate example of repressiveness ; Spain 's military leaders in Florida ? and the men who serve them ? are , like the savage ' Duke of Alba , crueller and more ferocious than the natives . Early in Pioneers of France Parkman writes of the effect of the wilderness on the French settlers in Florida , explaining a murder that took place at Port Royal in 1562 as a consequence of the awakening of the dormant savage in the breast of the civilized white man . This isolated murder soon pales in significance when followed by the Spaniards ' massacre of two hundred French Huguenot prisoners . The savage soldiery ' of Spain are like wolves ' in their lust for slaughter and so excel  | the Indians in ferocity that the French survivors prefer to entrust their lives to the natives rather than put themselves at the mercy of these white butchers . The story of the massacre is one of the most gruesome in all of Parkman 's histories of battle and conflict ; it is equalled only by an episode in The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The White Savage ' . That savage is a white man who has lived for some years among the Indians , having been captured by them , and has married a squaw by whom he has had several children . Wishing to return to the settlements and ingratiate himself with the whites , David Owens murders and scalps his Indian wife and half-breed children , intending to collect the bounties offered for them . Labelling this as devilish work ' , Parkman takes the opportunity to comment on the white barbarians ' who outdo the Indian in savagery . Owens 's coldblooded brutality is not to be understood as a unique aberration of the white psyche , for the Governor of Pennsylvania is himself implicated in the deed : he has proclaimed a bounty on every scalp of an Indian , male or female , over the age of ten . When the Paxton Men ' slaughter unarmed Conestoga Indians in Lancaster Jail , littering the ground with the mangled bodies of men , women and children , the spirit of the frontier has manifested itself in all classes , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record it until 1869 , the message left by French deserters from one of La Salle 's expeditions in the 1680s , Nous sommes tous sauvages ' , could serve as an epigraph for all his stories of New World savagery . Curiously , it was anticipated in one of his first published works : a story called The ScalpHunter ' published in the Knickerbocker magazine in April 1845 . In this early Semi-Historical Sketch ' as he called it , Parkman tells of an old human bloodhound ' , a white backwoodsman , who pursues an Indian with a reckless determination that can only be explained by the tenpound bounty on Indian scalps . In the tale , the Indian is the hunted game ' that must flee like a frightened deer ' from the white hunter . He is saved by the spirit of the White Mountains , a malignant spirit ' in Indian legend , but one that greets with death the first white man to enter the Crawford Notch , who plunges down the avalanche slope that Parkman had himself only just managed to scale on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should destroy the intrusive and destructive white man in Parkman 's early fiction is surely appropriate . The Indian , as the historian was later to say , was the true child ' of the forest and of the wilderness . But Nature was not benevolent even to her own children , as Parkman knew well , for his own experience of the wilderness taught him how precarious was man 's hold on  | life in his savage state . When he came , in The Jesuits in North America , to describe the winters on the Great Lakes , he portrayed dead Nature ' as sheeted in funereal white ' and the forests as silent as the grave ' ( p. 112 ) . Where the white man would perish , the Indian manages to survive ? but barely . Nature is hostile to white advance , but is clearly not protective of the red man . Parkman 's delight in the wildness of unimproved nature is a response to its sublimity , not its humanity ' in the Emersonian sense . Watching the cannibal warfare of some little fishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parkman decided that life is incessant war ' whatever the soft-hearted philanthropists ' would like to make of it ( Oregon Trail , ch. 19 ) . In such passages Parkman anticipates the naturalist writers of the 1890s , but , unlike them , he at the same time thought he believed in the high culture of Beacon Hill . Parkman 's official ' identification with the forces of progress and civilization in their encroachment on the wild is plainly stated in his preface to the first edition of The Conspiracy . When he began his researches , so he tells us , the field of history was uncultured and unreclaimed ' , so that the work he had to do was like that of the border settler , who , before he builds his rugged dwelling , must fell the foresttrees , burn the undergrowth , clear the ground , and hew the fallen trunks to due proportion ' ( p. xii ) . In the same preface Parkman explains that he was aided in the field-work necessary for his history by the strong natural taste ' that led him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. x ) . With such a natural taste ' the historian could hardly avoid ambivalent feelings about his function as tamer of the historical wilderness ; his allegiance to the civilization that resulted from the settlement of the wild was , as we have seen , less complete than his explicit ideas would lead us to suppose . At the end of his career , working on the last pages of his Half-Century of Conflict in 1890 , Parkman wrote in a room kept for him in the Wentworth mansion , a colonial house belonging to his son-in-law . On the wall of his work-room ( as Wilbur Jacobs tells us ) ' hung the fringed leather shirt and powder horn that he had used on his 1846 trip to the Oglala Sioux . With him , too , was the saddle he had mounted on his prairie horses on that adventurous expedition . To the end , Parkman indulged ' ( the word is his ) a taste for the wild that after 1846 could find expression only in his writings .
