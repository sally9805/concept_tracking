Additional material published Nov. 16 , 1988 : Corrections and clarifications . A story in the Nov. 15 Tribune on local reaction to Table proposed changes in Israel ' s Law of Return incorrectly quoted Rabbi Herman Schaalman as saying the proposed changes would cast in doubt " conversions by traditional rabbis . " Rabbi Schaalman said the changes would affect " nontraditional <> rabbis . " The Tribune regrets the error . Chicago ' s Jewish leaders are vehemently denouncing a demand by ultra- Orthodox Israeli politicians that would deny recognition to the predominant branches of Judaism in the United States . The demand , if it becomes Israeli law , would directly affect only a handful of people . But it has such symbolic importance that some people believe it could reduce State of Israel bond sales and private donations , which make up more than $500 million of Israel ' s $24 billion budget . The deal agreed to Sunday by Israel ' s ruling Likud Party would change the nation ' s Law of Return , which now guarantees automatic Israeli citizenship to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gain the support of two small religious parties , which it needed to form a governing coalition . Under the proposed change , only those Jews who had been converted by an Orthodox rabbi would receive automatic citizenship . Those converted by Conservative or Reform rabbis would have to go through the lengthy citizenship process required of non-Jews . According to Moshe Fox , spokesman for the Israeli consulate in Chicago , the proposal would have affected fewer than a dozen of the 3 , 634 Americans who became Israeli citizens in 1986 , the last year for which figures were available . But Chicago Jewish leaders say the plan is still a serious affront to the Conservative and Reform branches of Judaism , which represent more than two- thirds of American Jews . " We take this threat very seriously , " said Sylvia Neil , director of the Chicago office of the American Jewish Congress . " It ' s antithetical to all of Jewish belief and all of Jewish history to try to divide Jews in this way . " Reform Rabbi Herman Schaalman , who heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law would extend far beyond the comparatively few Jewish converts who want to become Israeli citizens . Because Orthodox Jews say the religion is passed through the mother , the children of an " improperly " converted woman could have their Jewishness called into question , he said . " Once all conversions by traditional rabbis are cast in doubt , then the children of those converts , by the tens of thousands , would suffer a similar reduction in status , " Rabbi Schaalman said . Jonathan Levine , Midwest regional director of the larger American Jewish Committee , said , " For the government of Israel to invalidate the Jewish denominations that the great majority of Jews in the U.S. support has come close to causing a schism in the Jewish community . " It would be a terrible shame for them to change the Law of Return . It is so shortsighted . It can bring permanent damage to Jewish unity merely for political expediency . " Levine said it was conceivable that American Jews might cut back on their generous contributions to the Israeli government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the feelings are stronger than even the Israelis know , " he said . The concern of the Chicago Jewish leaders is shared by those around the nation . On Saturday , 27 national Jewish organizations issued a statement saying the change in the Law of Return " would inflict enormous damage , actual and symbolic , " on Jews around the world . " I can ' t remember the last time that many Jewish organizations signed a statement on anything , " said Michael Lieberman , Midwest civil rights director of the Anti-Defamation League of B ' Nai B ' rith , one of the groups that issued the statement . " There ' s no question that this change could have a catastrophic impact on Israel ' s relations with the Diaspora ( Jews living outside Israel ) , " he said . Lieberman said the fate of the measure depends on whether Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir enforces party discipline on members of the Likud bloc when the amendment is called for a vote in parliament . " It ' s just like President Reagan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country but didn ' t really try to push any of it through Congress , " Lieberman said . " Shamir can ramrod the measure through , or he can tell his members to vote their consciences , in which case it will probably fail . " " It ' s too early to panic , " said Sol Goldstein , president of the Zionist Organization of Chicago . " I think everything will be ironed out . The unity of the Jewish people will be saved.
