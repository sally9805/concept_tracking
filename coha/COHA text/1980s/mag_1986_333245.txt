' NIGHT , MOTHER <P> The structure of Marsha Norman 's Pulitzer-prizewinning play was pure melodrama . An unhappy fortyish woman announces to her mother that she intends to take her own life that evening ; the older woman tries many stratagems to avert the plan but fails in all of them . Improbable as this plot was , it permitted Norman to explore with sensitivity a dramatically less riveting , emotionally more subtle matter : an archetypally vexatious mother-daughter relationship . In adapting play to screen , Norman and Director Tom Moore have been somewhat undone by their new medium 's imperatives . The realism of camera close-ups turns probability into utter implausibility . And the casting of Anne Bancroft and Sissy Spacek , who can not help projecting intelligence and the will to prevail , is inimical to the story 's cause . Still , the painful honesty of the play 's psychological observations survives and remains worthy of attention . <P> OTELLO <P> Why bother to film Verdi 's Otello if you are going to omit its most famous aria , the haunting Willow Song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeffirelli never quite answers that question . The flamboyant Italian 's 1983 cinematic version of La Traviata widened the opera 's scope with tender reminiscences only implied in the libretto . In Otello , however , flashbacks to the Moor 's slave childhood are maudlin , and Zeffirelli 's camera , jumping edgily from storm to massed choruses to brawls and bedrooms , tires the mind . As Otello , Tenor Placido Domingo is in robust voice , and Bass Justino Diaz makes a splendidly vile Iago . Yet Zeffirelli 's presumption in heavily editing Verdi 's taut masterpiece serves neither movie audiences nor opera lovers well , and the patina of homoeroticism that suffuses the film contradicts the heterosexual spirit of both libretto and score . No wonder he cut Desdemona 's big number . <P> SHE 'S GOT TA HAVE IT <P> This comedy of manners deserves plenty of goodwill . It was made in twelve days by 29-year-old Writer-Director-Editor Spike Lee . It displays the sumptuous camerawork of Ernest Dickerson . And it tries  --  how hard it tries  --  for something fresh . Nola Darling ( Tracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libido of her own , much to the exasperation of three swains . Seems like Woody Allen territory , with two important exceptions : the characters and creative team are black , and just about everyone is straining as hard for effect as Nola is for the perfect orgasm . If the film were as good as its intentions , She 's Got ta Have It might have earned the critical and popular praise lavished on it .
