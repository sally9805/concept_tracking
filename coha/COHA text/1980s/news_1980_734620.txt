txt All top officials of Nigeria 's state-owned oil company have been suspended in the aftermath of a multibillion-dollar scandal that has shaken black Africa 's most powerful nation . Sources close to developments said Nigeria 's new civilian president , Shehu Shagari , engineered the suspensions and personally took over the running of the company , Nigerian National Petroleum Corp .. or NNPC . Nigeria produces around 2.2 million barrels a day of a high-quality crude oil that is preferred by petroleum refiners for processing into gasoline and other light fuels . It is America 's second-largest crude-oil supplier after Saudi Arabia . Oil observers said , however , that they do n't expect the latest development in the Nigerian scandal to have any immediate impact on the U.S. oil companies operating there or on oil supplies coming to the U.S. from Nigeria . Although a reason was n't given , the suspensions are understood to stem from a recent audit of NNPC by a Nigerian affiliate of Coopers &; Lybrand International , the accounting concern . The audit showed that revenues of several billion dollars  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on NNPC 's books through the end of 1977 . Audit Ordered by Military The apparently missing billions had come to light . ironically , because the military auiiiuriiirn running Nigeria had wanted to present a tidy operation to the incoming civilian government last year and had ordered audits of all major governmental agencies . The audit of NNPC had showed that the books had been kept on a cash basis and that records did n't exist of substantial transactions known to have taken place between the company and several big foreign oil concerns . Last September , F.R.A. Marinho , then chairman of NNPC , ordered his own investigation into the matter once the results of the Coopers &; Lybrand audit came to his attention . Subsequently , however . Mr. Marinho was removed as chairman and named managing director of NNPC . Yesterday , he was suspended from that position , too . Among the others ordered out of their positions at least temporarily by Nigeria 's president were the members of NNPC 's board of directors as well as the company 's new chairman , A.F. Hart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries . The Nigerian president " got the right guys , " a crude-oil trader who buys and sells Nigerian crudes said . " A lot of those people got rich . " Payments Never Received Some oil traders said that as far back as 1973 , cargoes of crude oil purchased in Nigeria by certain trading companies had departed the African nation without proper credit credentials and that the government had never received payment for the crude oil . " You can imagine who got paid , " one source said . In recent months , industry sources said , would-be purchasers of Nigerian oil were being asked to pay premiums above the official prices on new contracts . As of April 1 , Nigeria raised its official prices 51 cents a barrel to bring its top price to $34.72 a barrel to match the top price charged by Libya . Nigeria traditionally patterns its oil prices after those of Libya . Also , last month most major contract purchasers of Nigerian crude were advised that their shares would be reduced as of April 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this oil , estimated to total 225,000 barrels a day , to new purchasers willing to pay premiums of $1.50 to $2.50 a barrel . But sources said yesterday the cuts in supplies to several major purchasers .
