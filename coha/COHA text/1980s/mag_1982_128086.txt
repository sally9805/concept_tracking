It 's Monday , Sept. 27 . The scene is an office in the CBS building in New York City , where the network 's NFL announcers have gathered to learn their assignments for the following Sunday . As a CBS executive goes down the line , handing out slips , anticipation turns to disbelief . " Wisconsin-Oshkosh at Wisconsin-Stout ? " says Tim Ryan in bewilderment after reading his slip . " Where is this Stout ? " // " There is n't any Stout , " says a voice from the back of the room . " That 's supposed to be a college . The name of the town is Menomonie. " // " Anybody know what a Millsap is ? " says Tom Brookshier . " First they separate me from Pat Summer all , then they give me West Georgia versus Millsaps in Jackson , Mississippi . You think they 're trying to tell me something ? " // Suddenly John Madden breaks into the room , waving his arms . " As I was saying , " he shouts , " this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in Springfield , Ohio . My train only goes to Toledo , but on this map here , it 's two inches to Springfield . So if I catch the train from Grand Central tomorrow .... " // Should the history of Division III football ever be recorded , let it be noted that Ryan found Stout , Brookshier learned to love Millsaps , and Madden drove those final two inches to Springfield . And at the University of San Diego-Occidental game in Los Angeles , Dick Stockton did n't fall from his open-air broadcast scaffold at the 50-yard line onto Occidental 's dirt running track . As our semifactual opening scene suggests  --  most of the words were spoken , but not in one room  --  some at CBS were skeptical about the network 's decision to air a slate of Division III games in place of NFL reruns on Sunday . They need n't have been . These games caught the spirit of American football Saturdays in a most unusual way . Midway through West Georgia 's 41-6 victory over Millsaps , Brookshier put it well . Noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that more than 3% of Millsaps ' student enrollment of 1,205 is on the football team , he said , " This is the way college football was meant to be played . " // According to its $131.75 million contract with the NCAA , CBS had to show four Division III games this season . When , where or how did n't matter . In fact , CBS planned to air the games " point-to-point , " or only to the towns where the schools are located and the immediate surrounding areas . But faced with the NFL strike and scrambling for substitute programming , CBS decided to fulfill its commitment in one afternoon . The result ? A Division III TV blitz in every region of the country . Fleeting fame for the likes of Steve Varga , the son of a Yugoslavian immigrant , whose fourth-quarter field goal gave Baldwin-Wallace a 16-14 win over Wittenberg . A glimpse of Lamar West of West Georgia , a 5 ' 8 " , 155-pound kickoff-return man who scored touchdowns of 92 and 91 yards . Afterward , West said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could see me because I 'm so small . " In short , the day was a moment in the sun for the unsung . " CBS asked us for our highlight films , " said Wisconsin-Oshkosh Sports Information Director Scott Berchtold . " We do n't even have highlight films . Sometimes we 're lucky to have game films . " // That CBS carried the Division III games says more about power politics in sports television than the network 's commitment to the football have-nots . When the NFL went down , CBS wanted to fill its pro football slots with Division I-A games . The NCAA said O.K. , but the other college football broadcasters  --  WTBS , Ted Turner 's SuperStation , and ABC  --  would n't allow CBS to broadcast extra games without extracting several pounds of teleflesh . Turner was n't even disposed to let CBS move a Division I-A game from Saturday to Sunday without the network making what it considered unreasonable concessions . For example , he wanted CBS to promise not to schedule college telecasts opposite the proposed NFL Players Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // CBS said no to Turner 's demands , leaving itself only with Division III , which accounts for 193 of the 506 football-playing schools in the NCAA but only .4% of this season 's television revenues . So impoverished is Millsaps ' football program that the $15,000 it got for appearing on CBS was equal to three-fifths of the college 's athletic budget . By contrast , a Division I-A university receives $600,000 for a regional TV appearance . // Once it settled on Division III , CBS had to choose the best matchups and persuade the home teams to switch their games to Sunday . Wittenberg , Millsaps and Occidental , which beat San Diego 34-20 , agreed to the move before the first $1,000 bill fluttered to the ground . But No. 1-ranked Widener ( playing Muhlenberg ) , Bowdoin ( playing Amherst ) and Wesleyan ( playing Tufts ) declined . Wisconsin-Stout became the final piece of the regional TV mosaic . Said Stout Athletic Director Warren Bowlus , " When we heard we had a chance to be on , it did n't take long to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying to convince Jim Flood Oshkosh 's athletic director that I was n't kidding . " Stout defeated Oshkosh 23-15. // For the announcers and the crews , solving logistical problems was no mean feat . As viewers learned , Division III stadiums are small . Brookshier had a hard time even finding Millsaps ' Alumni Field in Jackson . First he went to 62,500-seat Memorial Stadium , where Mississippi State plays . Then he stumbled onto Newell Field , a 10,000-seat high school facility . Both stadiums dwarf Alumni Field , which can seat 1,800 if all the fans sit with their legs together . At Occidental 's Patterson Field , 2,500 sardines sat on one side of the field , forcing the cameramen and announcers to set up in front of unfinished stands on the other side . " I 've seen stadiums in western Pennsylvania that were bigger than this , " said Stockton before the game . " The press box they have looks like a mummy 's tomb . It seats about four . Five players on the Occidental team live under the stadium . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the starting quarterback 's and the wide receiver's. " // Nor could the announcers prepare for the games with the normal 100,000 pages of statistics they are accustomed to getting from the NFL . Occidental Sports Information Director Gary Etcheverry was too busy to run the mimeo machine during the game anyway , seeing as how he 's also the team 's defensive coordinator . " I know the media expect stats at the end of each quarter , " said Etcheverry . " We normally do n't have them until Monday . " // Finally , there was the matter of prestige . Upon arriving in Springfield , Summerall called a friend in New York City , who asked him which game he was working on Sunday . " I told him Baldwin-Wallace and Wittenberg , " said Summerall , " and he said , ' Baldwin , Wallace and Wittenberg ? I thought there were only two teams playing . ' " // " Most Division III players lack size , " said Stockton , assessing the quality of the football he had broadcast . " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 40 would be , and the overall ability is lacking . But these kids want to play . " Added Madden , " I volunteered for this . This is important ; it 's good . With all the money talks and strike talks , this is refreshing . "
