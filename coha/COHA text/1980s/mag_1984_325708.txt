Machel looks west-and south We are Marxists , but riot in the religious sense of the word , " an adviser to Mozambique 's President conceded last year . That may be putting it mildly . Last October , during a fence-mending 18-day tour of Western Europe , President Samora Machel , 50 , was presented with a medal from Queen Elizabeth , and persuaded the British government to waive his country 's payment of a $30 million debt . In Portugal , Mozambique 's longtime colonial master and Machel 's bitter foe during a ten-year struggle for independence , the former guerrilla commander declared that the two countries were bound " in a friendship of steel . " Upon returning home , he gave his blessing to the accreditation of an American ambassador less than three years after expelling four U.S. diplomats on charges of spying . And last week in their capital city of Maputo , which has been blasted three times by South African raids , Mozambique officials began formal talks with their counterparts from South Africa . <P> The series of meetings between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ideological choice . With a per capita gross national product of $140 ( compared with around $14,000 in the U.S. ) , Mozambique remains one of the world 's poorest nations . Ongoing problems of mismanagement , corruption , lack of skilled workers and faulty agricultural planning have been compounded by the worst drought in 50 years . Over the past six months as many as 100,000 have died of starvation ; 4 million of the country 's 12.5 million people still do not have enough to eat . When food aid is sent from abroad , it is frequently blocked by the 10,000-member Mozambique National Resistance ( M.N.R. ) movement . The insurgents , reportedly backed by South Africa , have been devastating towns and terrifying citizens in nearly all of Mozambique 's ten provinces for five years . <P> Machel , who became last year the first African President to visit Soviet Leader Yuri Andropov , has not received a great deal of assistance lately from Moscow , which is still furious with him for his peace-seeking European safari . The Soviet Union did , to be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 1978 and 1982 . In return , however , it appropriated the country 's lucrative fishing industry , along with the income it produced . <P> That leaves South Africa as the source not only of Mozambique 's political unease but also of its potential economic stability . <P> Mozambique still receives most of its consumer goods and industrial supplies from its hated neighbor to the south . Though the number of Mozambicans working in South Africa 's mines has fallen by 65% since 1975 , some 50,000 are still laboring there , bringing in $70 million every year . <P> In addition , more than half of the goods passing through the port of Maputo come from the white-ruled republic . Another way for Mozambique to rake in South African rands would be by reopening its doors to tourism , a subject discussed in Pretoria and Maputo last week . Since Mozambique won independence in 1975 , wealthy South Africans have been denied access to its big-game hunting , deep-sea fishing and summer houses overlooking the sea .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
