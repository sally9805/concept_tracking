Every 15 or 20 years someone with a note pad and pencil arrives in Sauk Centre , Minn. , and asks cosmic questions : How 's it goin ' ? What 's the mood ? Whither America ? These visitations have been going on since 1920 , when a native son named Sinclair Lewis published a best-selling satire called Main Street about a town he dubbed Gopher Prairie , which no one ever seriously doubted was inspired by Sauk Centre . Gopher Prairie was drawn as smug , suspicious and stuck in its ways , and that was a liberating vision for a newly urban America about to plunge into the jazz age . Main Street became a metaphor for a certain kind of narrow-minded , self-satisfied , credulous America ; Lewis ' Babbitt and Elmer Gantry completed the picture . In 1930 , when Lewis became the first American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature , Sauk Centre 's role as national small-town bellwether was set for good . <P> This year is the 100th anniversary of Lewis ' birth . A postage stamp will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be a production of Thornton Wilder 's Our Town . The summer will see the annual Sinclair Lewis Days road race , beauty pageant and parade . The Sinclair Lewis Eagles Aerie and Auxiliary 3847 are selling popcorn at birthday events , and the Centennial Committee is offering souvenir T shirts , mugs and tractor hats . As Richard Lingeman writes in Small Town America : Lewis certainly would have " appreciated the transubstantiation of his indictment of Main Street into positive thinking .

No one ever made a metaphor out of neighboring Long Prairie or Gutches Grove or Alexandria . <P> Sauk Centre has 3,709 people , a number that has not changed much in 100 years .

Sauk Centre is flat and prairie plain . Despite the scattering of dairy farms and silos and little groves of trees , the landscape rolls open as the ocean right up to the edge of town . Winter lasts about eight months , and at 7:30 on Feb. 7 , the birthday morning , the view from a frost-coated Palmer House window was of what a local writer , Chuck Rathe , calls glittering bitterness  --  a sub-zero refraction of sunrise on salt and ice and frost , sparkling through clouds of steam and smoke , the air itself turned to veils . The cold and the seeping , whistling presence they call " that wind ! " are eerie and somehow ominous . <P> Grade-school children decorated place mats for the official birthday dinner . One contributor had drawn the yellow line down the middle of Main Street in an oblique , Miro-like style , an imaginative effort to contain its unwieldy width , its absence of definition by such amenities as regular curbs , trees or design coherence .
