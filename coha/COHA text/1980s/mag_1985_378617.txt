After more than a year of steadily worsening reports from famine-stricken Africa , there is finally a glimmer of good news . In preparation for the opening of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization 's ( FAO ) biannual conference in Rome last week , Director-General Edouard Saouma announced that Africa 's best rains in years were producing record harvests in some areas . As a result , only five of the 21 African countries that needed emergency food aid this year  --  Angola , Botswana , Ethiopia , Mozambique and Sudan  --  remain on the list , and in 1986 Africa will need less than half the 7 million tons of food aid it required this year . Still , Saouma was quick to warn that the crisis was not over . " The rains have recovered , " he said . " Africa has not . " <P> Among the problems that continue to bedevil Africa are war , inadequate transportation , and shortages of seed , fertilizer and plow animals . Says Robert McCloskey , external-affairs counselor for Catholic Relief Services : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The harvest is better , but the number of people in need will remain high . " Another problem is that little has been done to make African agriculture more resilient . Few of the drought-prone countries have grain reserves , and a lack of rain next year could easily wipe out this year 's gains . " The emphasis is still on feeding the person , not helping him to produce , " says Saouma . <P> Sudan is a typical example of the good and bad news . The Sudanese needed 1.4 million tons of food aid this year , but a bumper harvest in the country 's fertile east has halved the requirements for 1986 . In the country 's inaccessible western provinces of Darfur and Kordofan , however , famine still afflicts hundreds of thousands . Farm families ate their seed and slaughtered their oxen just to stay alive . When the rains came , they had nothing to plant . Because roads in the area were washed out by the summer rains , relief groups had to organize costly flights to reach the famine victims . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Botswana , all the countries faced with continuing food emergencies are racked by civil wars . In Ethiopia , fighting between rebels and government forces in the northern provinces of Tigre and Eritrea has severely limited farming . Catholic Relief Services estimates that 5 million to 6 million Ethiopians still need food aid , and many of them are in unreachable war zones . But transportation in the rest of Ethiopia should improve in December with the arrival of 250 trucks donated by U.S. AID , the Live Aid Foundation and the Band Aid Trust . <P> None of this assistance , however , will be sufficient unless agricultural production can at least keep up with Africa 's 3% annual population growth rate . If long-term food production and population trends in Africa continue , says Mostafa Tolba , chief of the U.N . Environment Program , the continent 's population will double to 1 billion by the year 2007 , requiring imports of 203 million tons of food a year .                   @ @
