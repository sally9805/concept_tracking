LAS VEGAS , Nev.  --  Golden Nugget Inc. ' s chairman Stephen A. Wynn likes to boast that executives of the hotel and gambling concern are top-flight gamblers . " Nobody works for me who can ' t shoot craps , " Mr. Wynn says . And late last week , Mr. Wynn took one of the biggest dice rolls of his career with Golden Nugget ' s offer to buy nearly 25% of Hilton Hotels Corp. for $72 a share , as a possible first step in acquiring the entire company . Mr. Wynn is talking about raising $1. 78 billion to take over a company that has more than twice the revenue of Golden Nugget and that is openly hostile to his overtures . If this weren ' t daunting enough , the game plan Mr. Wynn initially laid out seems already to be going awry . The 25% chunk of Hilton , about 6. 8 million shares , is part of the estate of the hotel chain ' s founder , Conrad N. Hilton , who died in 1979 . Ownership of that stock is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barron Hilton , son of the founder and currently chairman , president and chief executive officer of Hilton Hotels . In announcing his offer last week , Mr. Wynn said he hoped to enlist the support of James E. Bates , executor of the estate . Last week , a Hilton spokesman said Mr. Bates had sent Mr. Wynn a letter rejecting the offer as " inadequate . " Golden Nugget yesterday said it received Mr. Bates ' s letter indicating that the offer is inadequate . A spokesman said Golden Nugget is " exploring some other avenues " to obtain the estate ' s shares . " We don ' t have a specific plan formulated , " said Bruce Levin , a Golden Nugget vice president . " We ' re hoping Mr. Bates will reconsider , though there ' s no indication that he will . " Also yesterday , Hilton said that the Internal Revenue Service has decided to issue a tentative ruling that would , in effect , support Barron Hilton ' s claim to his father ' s stock  --  a development Mr. Hilton said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares . Hilton said it also had raised its bank credit line to $600 million from $250 million in an apparent step to bolster its takeover defenses . Despite the obstacles , nobody is yet counting out the 43-year-old Mr. Wynn , who built his own and his company ' s fortunes through a series of audacious moves . At age 25 , for example , he parlayed $10 , 000 of his own money and $25 , 000 from his parents ' legal bingo parlor into 3% of the Frontier Hotel &; Casino , which was subsequently purchased by billionaire Howard Hughes . From the Hughes transaction , Mr. Wynn met his longtime mentor and adviser , powerful Las Vegas banker E. Parry Thomas . At Mr. Thomas ' s urging , Mr. Wynn used his Frontier profit to buy into several ventures , including a liquor distributorship and real estate . Among his purchases was a lot adjacent to Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas Strip , where Mr. Wynn envisioned building his own casino . Caesars bought the lot from Mr. Wynn for about $2 million , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the proceeds , he bought his controlling interest in Golden Nugget , which was then a dingy , lackluster , single-casino operation . In 1979 , with the help of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . , Golden Nugget pulled together a debt-and-equity financing package that allowed the company to build its Atlantic City hotel-casino at a cost that was more than twice the company ' s assets at that time . " No one said we could make that deal , either , " Mr. Wynn says . More recently , Mr. Wynn has guided Golden Nugget through a number of profitable investment ventures , including the purchase of a nearly 5% interest in MCA Inc . , Universal City , Calif . That purchase set off a steady stream of rumors that Golden Nugget was going to try to take over MCA , an entertainment business . The normally voluble Mr. Wynn insisted his company was merely a passive investor , but declined to elaborate . Golden Nugget ultimately sold the stock for a profit that wasn ' t disclosed . Mr. Wynn runs the Golden Nugget casinos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " smooth and easy . It ' s ' show biz . ' " That includes acting as the straight man for Frank Sinatra on television commercials plugging Golden Nugget casinos . Mr. Wynn acknowledges that his flamboyant style and public image cause some people to dismiss or underestimate his business acumen . " It ' s one thing to be colorful , which suits the business we happen to be in , " he says . " But I don ' t think it ' s wise to confuse that with a man ' s determination in an area where he makes his livelihood . Every day of my life isn ' t Saturday night , " he says . Indeed , some observers suspect that Mr. Wynn ' s play toward Hilton may be a ploy to help him secure a smaller but still tantalizing prize : Hilton ' s new Atlantic City casino , for which the company is running into difficulties in trying to get a license from state gambling regulators . Does Mr. Wynn hope to force Hilton into selling its casino as the price for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come on , let ' s not discuss Atlantic City , " he says .
