KALGOORLIE , Australia  --  In most elections , voters go to the polls . But in Kalgoorlie , Australia ' s rugged West and the biggest electoral district in the democratic world , the polls often come to the voters . So , of course , do the politicians , though the trek is by no means easy  --  as Old Gummy will attest . Kalgoorlie ' s 891 , 000 square miles run the length of the country from the tropical coast of the Timor Sea in the north to the chilly waters of the Great Australian Bight in the south . In a region that ' s roughly the size of Western Europe , give or take Scandinavia , many of the 70 , 000 voters are so isolated that in Saturday ' s Parliamentary election , ballot boxes will have to be brought in by plane . " There ' s one voting district in Canada that ' s almost as big , but where they have ice and snow , I ' ve got deserts , " says Graeme Campbell , the 47-year-old Australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reelection as Kalgoorlie ' s member of Parliament . " The size stems from this quaint view we have that all votes should be equal . " By law , all Australian voting districts must contain about 70 , 000 voters . In the cities , that number lives in a radius of a few miles . But Mr. Campbell ' s district is so sparsely settled that the average voter has 11 square miles of elbow room . Politicians everywhere complain about the rigors of campaigning , but consider Mr. Campbell ' s plight . In a recent week , he covered 6 , 000 miles to visit seven towns . For all his traveling , he is remarkably accident-prone . In a recent three-town whistle-stop tour , he left his luggage behind in Perth , ran out of gas in Port Hedland and lost his airline ticket to Kununurra . Mr. Campbell , who won the seat of Kalgoorlie for the Labor Party in 1980 , has an unusual background for a politician . His Old Gummy nickname comes from the time he blew his teeth out while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was solid limestone country , " he explains , " and you needed gelignite to blast holes for the fence posts . It was late in the day and I used a tatty old bit of fuse . The bloody thing went off while I was standing there looking at it . " A high-school dropout , Mr. Campbell once caught animals in the wild for zoos . He can still describe the technique for wrestling a seven-foot-tall kangaroo into a rice sack . After the government banned animal catching , Mr. Campbell and his brother opened up a grazing property on the virgin scrub of the Nullarbor Plain . There he met his future wife , a young French tourist who was exploring the outback and took on a job in the wool shed . " At the end of the shearing season I owed her so much money I had to marry her , " he says . The couple settled in Kalgoorlie , the gold-mining town from which the electorate takes its name , and Mr. Campbell went into the milk-distribution business . His varied background makes him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s north , the cattle ranchers of the center and the tuna catchers of the south . As their member of Parliament , Mr. Campbell must try to solve his constituents ' problems . " You get a lot of bother with bodies , " Mr. Campbell says , " especially among Aborigines . " If an Aborigine dies away from his traditional lands , the body must be brought back . Difficulties crop up in communities that aren ' t served by rail or air . " I ' ve had to organize friends to drive bodies back in their cars , " Mr. Campbell says . One of the advantages of Kalgoorlie is that events in the district tend to be somewhat more colorful than the round of debutante balls and business luncheons that confronts most campaigning politicians . Take the Black Rock Stakes , which grew out of a wager between two iron-ore miners in the town of Goldsworthy in 1971 . Over a few beers in the mine ' s pub , each miner bet the other that he couldn ' t push a wheelbarrow full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles away . The bet burgeoned into an annual event , with miners traveling from as far away as Broken Hill in New South Wales to compete . The race is usually followed by an all-night party at the finish line . " If you ' re smart you go to bed , get up in the morning and say , ' Great night , mate , great night , ' " he says . " Most of them ' ll have been too drunk to remember if you were there or not . " It would take a 6% swing against the Labor government for Mr. Campbell to loose Kalgoorlie . He isn ' t particularly worried . He has picked out a patch of ground near Marble Bar , Australia ' s hottest town , which he thinks is likely to provide the next big gold strike . " If I lose the election I ' ll go prospecting , " he says . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal                 @ @ @ @
