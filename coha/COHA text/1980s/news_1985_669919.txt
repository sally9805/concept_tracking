" After the days of luxury , we have become A lamb in the midst of the jungle . Like a gang , the wolves of the market Swirl around us. "  --  Manei Saeed al Otaiba , Oil Minister , United Arab Emirates , During OPEC ' s meeting last month . GENEVA , Switzerland  --  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has lost another round in the world-wide struggle over oil prices . The winners are the burgeoning free market in petroleum and oil consumers around the world . Half to two-thirds of the oil sold globally every day is transferred at free-market prices that are at least $2 to $3 a barrel below OPEC ' s official benchmark price , estimates Michel D. Marks , the chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange . And OPEC ' s share of the oil being sold in the non-Communist world has plunged to about one-third of the total volume from its 1979 high of about two-thirds . " OPEC has lost control because it sells a minor share of world oil . Prices are set in free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Marks , whose commodities exchange is handling increasing volumes of speculative oil contracts every month . In OPEC ' s heyday , the oil ministers of its 13 member countries met twice a year for a day or so , dictated world oil prices and went home . Now , under pressure from the world oil markets , they are hurling accusations at each other and have been breaking agreements as fast as they make them . In two weeks , they plan to hold their eighth meeting in 25 months in another desperate attempt to stem the price slide . It won ' t be easy . Today ' s average price on the spot market has already dropped to between $26 and $27 a barrel from the high of about $36 a barrel in 1980 . And on Dec. 30 , the day after OPEC ' s latest crisis meeting , Ahmad Zaki Yamani , Saudi Arabia ' s oil minister , dropped the first hint of a new price cut by OPEC itself . Sitting with a small group of reporters in his suite atop the Intercontinental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Yamani answered a question in words that may seem bland but to oil experts amount to the dropping of a bomb . No , he said casually , he wasn ' t particularly attached any longer to the notion of keeping oil prices pegged to the $29-a-barrel OPEC benchmark price . He added , in his soft , measured way : " I am very flexible . " That remark , couched in the technicalities of price differentials between light and heavy crude oils , carried a clear message : The cartel ' s most powerful oil minister and its chief tactician was conceding that , a decade after seizing control of global oil markets , OPEC can ' t set prices any longer . The late-January meeting is going to be especially difficult for OPEC because Iran and Algeria , longtime political foes of Saudi Arabia , are saying they will oppose any price cuts that Mr. Yamani may propose . So , oil experts expect another outbreak of bickering by OPEC ministers as oil prices continue drifting down . For oil-product consumers around the world , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in inflation-adjusted energy prices are pleasant thoughts . As the disinflationary effects ripple through the world ' s economies , interest rates may tend to ease and business investment and economic growth to strengthen . Third World debtor countries , such as Brazil , that import oil may get relief on two fronts : lower oil bills and lower interest payments on their debts . But for big debtor nations that also are oil exporters , such as Mexico and Nigeria , OPEC ' s woes increase their financial problems . As a result , the international banking system may come under further strain . Facing such pressures , Mr. Yamani was proposing , in his Geneva hotel suite , a deal that seemed singularly forlorn . The oil minister of OPEC ' s leading producer wanted to negotiate a gentle slide in oil prices  --  with the help of Western governments , particularly Britain and Norway , which have become major oil producers and thus OPEC competitors . And he had a bargaining chip : the threat of a price war in which everyone loses , the threat of turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on everybody ' s head . Talking to the group of reporters , he invoked images of bank failures , of thousands of oil-related businesses collapsing , of countries unable to pay for imports , of oil exploration slowing drastically as oil became too cheap for investors to finance drilling costs . But however Mr. Yamani tries to moderate the oil-price slide , most analysts are betting that the current downtrend will take prices this year as low as $25 a barrel  --  a quote actually registered on the spot markets during the first week of January . A few analysts are even talking of $20-a-barrel oil . Analysts note a variety of forces depressing oil prices . The conservation measures gradually instituted in the wake of the first oil-price " shocks " are really beginning to bite . Moreover , new oil discoveries are being made all the time , and oil producers that weren ' t in the business 10 years ago are jostling for more of the OPEC ' s shrinking market share . Oil now is being exported by , among others , Russia , China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as Britain and Norway . The British and Norwegian North Sea fields alone are producing 3. 5 million barrels a day , more than most OPEC countries do . Altogether , non-OPEC countries account for 67% of the whole world ' s immediately available oil , according to an estimate by Petroleum Intelligence Weekly , a newsletter based in New York . Mr. al Otaiba , the UAE ' s poetry-prone oil minister , calculates that last year alone , non-OPEC production rose one million barrels a day . In the next six months , he predicts , it will increase another 600 , 000 barrels a day . But the worst damage to OPEC has been self-inflicted . As cartels go , OPEC has been a miserable flop . Squeezed by falling demand and hard-pressed for cash , OPEC members began breaking ranks three years ago . Iran , Ecuador , the UAE , Qatar and Algeria , among others , instituted their own under-the-table discounts to sell oil below OPEC-mandated prices . Even Saudi Arabia , which has broken OPEC ' s rules the least , dumped 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barter deal with Boeing to buy 10 747 airliners . The Saudis didn ' t want to dip into their financial reserves for the money ; but because they discounted oil in a glutted market , prices were depressed last summer and nearly collapsed . Nigeria , saddled with $22 billion in foreign debts and 100 million mouths to feed , has increasingly been turning into OPEC ' s maverick ever since February 1983 . Last October , the African nation officially abandoned the cartel ' s pricing structure , by cutting its prices $2 a barrel below OPEC prices on comparable crudes . And now , despite OPEC warnings of a price war , first Norway and then Britain have moved to sell all their oil at spot-market prices in December and January . The prices have been about $2 a barrel below the official North Sea quote of $28. 65 a barrel . To reverse the downtrend , OPEC has been hoping for a tough winter . After an unusually warm December , a severe cold snap in Western Europe early this month has bolstered prices a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most analysts expect a major price crunch this spring , when demand for OPEC oil may fall even below the current output ceiling , set at a total of 16 million barrels a day for all 13 OPEC members . Such a crisis would test the cartel to the limit . Although Nigeria ' s financial troubles give OPEC its most pressing headaches , all cartel members , rich and poor , have been hurt by lower revenues since 1981 , when oil buyers ' conservation programs began to depress the market . A distillation of information available from OPEC , the International Monetary Fund , oil companies and trade newsletters indicates that Saudi Arabia ' s oil income , for instance , plunged from $113 billion in 1981 to about $47 billion in 1983 . Over the same period , Indonesia ' s oil income plummeted from $14. 3 billion to $10. 9 billion and Venezuela ' s from $17. 4 billion to $13. 5 billion . Altogether , OPEC ' s oil income dropped from $247. 6 billion in 1981 to $154 billion in 1983 , and the 1984 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides losing revenues , Saudi Arabia has lost substantial shares of its production and of the market . Since 1983 , the nation has undertaken the role of OPEC ' s " swing producer , " reducing output when world demand for OPEC oil drops . The agreement to play that role was premised , however , on a willingness of other OPEC members to stick to production quotas . Instead , the other 12 members have overproduced at Saudi Arabia ' s expense . Although the Saudi quota under the OPEC agreements is about five million barrels a day , Mr. Yamani complained in Geneva that his country ' s production hasn ' t exceeded 3. 5 million barrels a day since last October and may have dropped to 3. 2 million barrels a day last month . Despite the drop in Saudi production , some oil executives argue that Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies in the Persian Gulf , including Kuwait , Qatar and the UAE , can still stabilize oil prices , if they want to , because they are OPEC ' s richest members and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They hold the key , " said Marc Rich , the fugitive oil trader who runs his global commodity network from Zug , Switzerland . " Although cartels historically have never succeeded , OPEC has held longer and better than others . With discipline , the Persian Gulf producers can still pull it together , " Mr. Rich said in a telephone interview . But with the oil glut undermining Saudi influence over prices , other observers think that the Saudis ' concern over losing markets to competitors casts doubt on their willingness to keep shoring up prices with production cutbacks . " Alone , the Saudis haven ' t the clout to control the market , " an Algerian OPEC official says . " They need support inside OPEC and from non-OPEC producers , too . " With little support forthcoming , most Saudi and industry sources say Saudi Arabia has nearly reached the limits of its patience and is ready to use what Saudis call " shock therapy " : a price war that would shock everyone , from Britain and Norway to OPEC members , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied in earnest , by all accounts , in Riyadh , the Saudi capital . It is time , Mr. Yamani said in Geneva , for Britain and Norway to realize " that this is serious . If we start a price war  --  and we have every intention of doing so if we have to  --  the revenues of the U.K. , for example , will drop sharply . If there is a price war , there will be real chaos in the market . . . . We will not create a stable lower price for oil . We will just go up and down and hit whatever floor we want to hit . " Such a policy would be risky . " We know the damage of the upward jump in oil prices , " Sir Peter Walters , the chairman of British Petroleum , said in an interview last summer when oil prices nearly collapsed . " A sudden , precipitous drop could be bad , too . . . . What guarantee do we have to hold the price at $25 a barrel or at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they do nothing , their own position as oil exporters and their revenues would continue to erode . If , on the other hand , they do provoke a price war , they run a major risk of having Saudi Arabia  --  a country heavily dependent on good will  --  antagonize its more powerful neighbors and an array of other groups . " Politically , I don ' t think they can do that , " says Thomas McHale , a senior economist with Drexel Burnham Lambert and a frequent visitor to Saudi Arabia . " There are a lot of vested interests  --  the banks that know Saudi Arabia , oil companies , friendly oil producers who ' d go bankrupt , like Mexico and Indonesia  --  who will rush to stop the Saudis from doing it . " The Saudis are more likely to show their impatience with OPEC in another way . One observer suggests that Mr. Yamani , by distancing himself now from the responsibility for defending the OPEC benchmark price , will let prices fall by default . During the December meeting , Mr. Yamani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disintegrating . " We are sick and dying , " he told his colleagues . Instead of celebrating OPEC ' s 25th anniversary this year , he sarcastically suggested , the cartel should " suspend " itself for a couple of years .
