The cast , which includes Carole Shelley , who won a Tony for " The Elephant Man , " Alyson Reed , Paula Laurence , Rebecca Luker , Reed Jones , John Remme and Robert Cook , will be joined by a full orchestra and chorus. // The production opens the fifth season of a musical theater troupe whose glowing , meticulous concert revivals of vintage Broadway shows have drawn a growing , and enthusiastic following . Since the company ' s 1981 debut in the Sigmund Romberg-Oscar Hammerstein 2d hit-filled 1928 score of " The New Moon , " it has presented concert productions of such Broadway classics as " Eileen , " " The Firefly , " " Rosalie , " " One Touch of Venus , " " Sweethearts , " " Roberta , " " Leave It to Jane , " " Music in the Air , " " Sweet Adeline " as well as a tribute to " George White ' s Scandals. " // The New Amsterdam Theater Company is the brainchild of its 29-year-old artistic director , Bill Tynes , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California in 1977 to be an actor and musician and ended up a producer. // " I was a fan of vintage musicals from the age of 10 when I began collecting 12-inch 78 rpm records of light-opera favorites recorded by Victor in the teens and 20 ' s , " Mr. Tynes recalled the other day . " By the time I was a freshman in college , I was regularly staging community productions of musicals in Orange County . I founded the company specifically to help preserve our rich musical theater heritage. " // Officially , the troupe was born at a 1981 benefit cocktail party in the Algonquin Hotel . Some 150 guests , including many Broadway actors and actresses , raised $5 , 000 to produce " The New Moon . " Its success prompted the Town Hall Foundation to approach the company about putting on a " Great American Musicals " series . Since then , costs have risen to $35 , 000 for two performances of a concert musical . But the company ' s subscription audience has blossomed proportionately - from 250 to nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen for many different reasons , but the bottom line is finally the score , " said Mr. Tynes . " Often the shows have wonderful scores , but their books would not hold up to a full production . ' Jubilee ' is an exception . It plays beautifully . I defy you to find a better book for a show produced on Broadway during the last 10 years . " <> <> Inspired by Royal Family // " Jubilee " was written by Cole Porter and Moss Hart during a world cruise in 1934-35 , with the music for " Begin the Beguine " said to have been inspired by music heard on the island of Kalabahi in the Dutch East Indies. // Its story , inspired by the English royal family ' s silver jubilee , tells of another royal family , in an unnamed kingdom , who go incognito among the people after being threatened with insurrection . The experience gives the royal family an opportunity to pursue its fantasies , and Porter and Hart used the notion to poke fun at a number of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dare , a Noel Coward type , who is the author of " Scheme for Dying , " among other plays . The queen takes swimming lessons from her idol , Charles Rausmiller , who is based on Johnny Weissmuller . The king , who does rope tricks , becomes the protege of a society matron , Eva Standing , based on Elsa Maxwell , while the prince rushes off to pursue a nightclub singer. // It hasn ' t been difficult for Mr. Tynes to persuade an impressive roster of Broadway veterans to perform in the New Amsterdam restorations . " Everybody is paid on a ' favored nations ' arrangement , " he said . " That means everybody gets the same salary and equal billing . It ' s also attractive to performers because each show involves a commitment of only a week to 10 days . And it is not every day that a singer gets to perform unmiked with a 20- to 25-piece orchestra in a hall with great acoustics. " // One of the problems of presenting faithful restorations of vintage shows is locating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a throwaway entertainment , and there was little attempt to preserve it , " Mr. Tynes said . " The attitude was analogous to the way movie studios allowed their silent film libraries to rot after the talkies came in . It is only very recently that a historical awareness has taken root . The revival of ' On Your Toes , ' done with its original orchestrations , rather than contemporized , opened a lot of people ' s eyes . " <> <> ' Revenge With Music ' Next // " Jubilee " is the first of three shows the New Amsterdam company will offer this season . In mid-April , it will present " Revenge With Music " ( 1934 ) , the first book musical by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz , and based on the same Pedro de Alarcon novel that inspired Manuel de Falla ' s ballet " The Three-Cornered Hat . " The score ' s most famous tune is " You and the Night and the Music . " May will bring Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart ' s " I Married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker who vows he will only marry an angel . Unforeseen complications arise when a real angel ( originally played by Vera Zorina ) arrives to gratify his fantasy . The show ' s most enduring standard is " Spring Is Here . " The revival will re-create the music from the show ' s acclaimed honeymoon ballet , choreographed by George Balanchine for Miss Zorina. " // Mr. Tynes hopes that the New Amsterdam Theater Company can soon augment concert restorations with theatrical revivals . Three of his dream projects are a re-creation of the original production of " Show Boat " and the 1919 and 1927 " Ziegfeld Follies " in the grand manner . " I certainly did not pick the right business to become rich in , " Mr. Tynes said . " In order to do this , you really have to have Broadway history in your blood. " // Show times for " Jubilee " are Sunday at 4 P.M. and Monday at 8 P.M. Tickets are $14 and $20 , and may be obtained at the Town Hall box office , 123 West 43d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number is 757-0262 .
