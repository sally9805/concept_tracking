George Bush 's march across the Continent last week threw into sharp relief two major and intersecting historic trends . His foray into Poland and Hungary highlighted how Eastern Europe , at least in part , is tumbling toward greater independence from its Soviet overlords . His attendance at the Paris summit of industrialized nations at week 's end illustrated , less intentionally , how Western Europe similarly continues to become more independent of the U.S. And Bush 's skimpy aid offerings in Warsaw and Budapest showed that as the waning of the cold war hastens these shifts in Europe 's tectonic plates , the U.S. is likely to find it both necessary and wise to let its allies take the lead in managing Western responses to changes in Eastern Europe . <P> The most important aspect of Bush 's visit was its symbolism . " The Iron Curtain has begun to part , " the President declared in an eloquent speech at the Karl Marx University in Budapest . In front of Gdansk 's Lenin shipyard , he told cheering Poles , " America stands with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Poland and Hungary , he avoided baiting the Soviet Union , a sensible strategy for dealing with a bear that for the moment seems unusually amiable . <P> He was less lavish , however , with his finances . In Poland he pledged $100 million in economic aid and an added $15 million for controlling pollution in Cracow ; he also pledged support for a move to reschedule some of the nation 's foreign debt . In Hungary he offered $25 million in economic aid , $5 million for an environmental center , a $1.5 million a year Peace Corps project to help teach English , and the end of trade restrictions . <P> Such gifts seemed rather paltry , less than Lyndon Johnson might have dropped on some backwater congressional district during a quickie campaign stop . The $115 million offered to Poland , for example , would barely dent a decimal point in that nation 's $39 billion foreign debt . Some of his European hosts were disappointed . Solidarity leader Lech Walesa pressed the case for $10 billion in assistance , and Communist Party leader Wojciech Jaruzelski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major rescheduling of Poland 's debt . Hungarian banker and businessman Sandor Demjan , in a gesture that was at once magnanimous and a bit slighting ( as well as rather amazing ) , told the New York Times that he would match the $25 million in direct U.S. economic aid . The $145 million in Bush 's gift bag for easing Poland and Hungary away from Communism was dwarfed last week by the $70 billion the Air Force requested for the Stealth bomber program and by the $43 billion for the Third World that Japan offered at the Paris summit . <P> American officials , however , argue that massive handouts would be unproductive . During the past two decades , the regimes in Poland and Hungary entrenched themselves by using foreign loans to subsidize cheap consumer goods rather than upgrade industries . " The last thing the West should do is to forgive us our debts , " says a senior Hungarian diplomat . " It would just relieve the pressure for reforms , so it would be money down the drain again .
