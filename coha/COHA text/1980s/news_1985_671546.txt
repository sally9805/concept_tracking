In this place , on the western edge of the Ogaden region , which the sun has turned into a desert of dull brown , wind-blown dust , it is difficult to find the skeletal children like those who died by the thousands in feeding camps in the last year . Nor does a visitor see the old people who hobbled for miles searching for food and water , or the young whose youth was stolen by starvation . At the moment , thousands of tons of bulgur wheat , powdered milk and cooking oil are being delivered all over the country and distributed to millions of Ethiopians. // Nonetheless , Ethiopian officials , United Nations representatives and private relief officials say this country will require as much food as it received in 1985 if widespread starvation is to be averted . What worries them now is that only one-third of the estimated 1. 2 million tons of needed food has been committed so far , that by the United States. // // U.N. Sounds Alarm // Reports from two United Nations agencies in recent days have also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were plagued by drought and hunger in 1984 and earlier this year . They say many thousands of Africans may die of starvation or related diseases next year if aid efforts prove inadequate . Page A4 . At a makeshift food distribution center here , a young nomad woman stood watching a nurse weigh her child inside a canvas tent . Outside , hundreds of other women , all with small children , waited under the hot sun . Like many other Issa-speaking nomads whose way of life has been all but erased , the young woman had come here for food to feed her family. // " We had 500 sheep and goats and 40 camels , " said the young woman , Esino Guelle , her head bound in the traditional thick folds of a black gauzelike cloth . " They are all gone . But I have 10 goats. " // Erik Moller , the head of the United Nations World Food Program ' s Africa task force , said : " Ethiopia unfortunately is a country that is facing a crisis in 1986 . It is essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are going to have a big problem. " // Indeed , some experts say that only the locus of the drought has shifted. // " Historically , drought and famine in Ethiopia move from the north to the south and east , " said Frederick Cuny , the chairman of Intertect , a disaster-assessment consulting concern based in Dallas . " That ' s what we ' re seeing here . The famine is moving south and eastward . The drought is moving into the traditional food-producing areas . " Francis X. Carlin , the head of Catholic Relief Services in Ethiopia , one of the largest private distributors of food here , said : " The pledges from the donor community have not been forthcoming . What hasn ' t been ordered now isn ' t going to arrive until at least June . We ' re already looking at flashpoints in April . If you don ' t respond to a rapidly deteriorating situation , people start dying. " // Nowhere do prospects look bleaker than here in Harerge . Momino Fara , a 60-year-old Issa nomad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut fashioned from grass mats and sticks - on the edge of this village . Through an interpreter , she explained in a careful , almost cryptic way why she can no longer move about as she had done for her entire life. // " All the animals died because of the drought , " she said as she moved away a dead bramble that formed the gate to her tukul . " We are here because of the drought . For three years ' duration , there was a drought . We don ' t have any sheep or goats , and we can ' t do anything now even if the rains come . " <> <> Nomads Are Gathering // Aydara is now a collection of mud-walled , grass-roofed huts on the south side of the food distribution center operated by the Lutheran World Federation . To the north , like birds gathering before a storm , the huts of nomads are being set down in greater and greater numbers. // " Totally at this time , 1. 2 million people in Harerge are affected , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Relief and Rehabilitation Commission . " Productivity will be 45 percent lower than usual . The region is not self-sufficient . Unless we get enough rainfall for the next year , the number of beneficiaries will increase. " // The Ethiopian Government has just completed its projection of how large the country ' s harvest will be next year , and of how much food will be needed to feed its people . The picture is bleak. // " This year ' s crop production is expected to be far below the food requirement of the population in most of the regions of the country , " said the latest " Early Warning System Report " issued by the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission . " The devastating effect of the 1984 drought on the pastoral population of the country was so immense that recovery is not foreseen in the near future . In fact , in some areas it is expected to worsen since the rainfall has not improved even this year. " #5. 8 Million Will Need Aid The Government estimates that 5. 8 million people will need food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort of food aid this year - or they will starve . To feed that many people , the commission said 1. 158 million metric tons of food will be needed , only slightly less than the amount provided Ethiopia by foreign donors in 1985 . But much more food was needed this year than the country received , officials said. // The Government has not tried to calculate the number of people who died from starvation and disease in the last 18 months , but estimates by relief organizations range from several hundred thousand to more than one million. // This month , in the highlands of Harerge and in the west and north of Ethiopia , there is the green of crops maturing . It is a sight largely unfamiliar but one that is , according to many experts , dangerously deceptive. // " We ' ve accepted that through ' 86 we ' re still in an emergency relief phase , " said James R. Cheek , the United States Ambassador to Ethiopia . " This year , we saved people ' s lives , restored nutrition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weren ' t able to get people back in time to get crops in . We got some back , but we didn ' t get them back with enough tools. // " The rains weren ' t that good , " the Ambassador continued . " The area under cultivation is less , and in the areas under cultivation , there wasn ' t the right seed or enough seed or there weren ' t enough oxen to plow deep enough . They ' ll bring in a harvest this year , but instead of having grain for a year , they ' ll only have enough for four or five months . " <> <> ' It ' s a Green Famine ' // Mr. Cuny of Intertect said : " It ' s a green famine . There ' s sorghum in the fields , but there ' s no seed on it . The maize is withered. " // The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has estimated that the harvest next year will fall 13 to 15 percent below a " normal " year , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1983 . That would mean a shortfall of 800 , 000 to 900 , 000 tons in 1986. // But as the Ethiopian Relief Commission noted in its recent analysis of the food organization ' s report , the production shortfall constitutes only a portion of the country ' s overall food deficit . " We also have about 1. 2 million pastoral people who don ' t produce crops but are expected to need grain assistance in 1986 , " the commission ' s report said. // For people like Esino Guelle and Momino Faro , food aid means two 50-pound sacks of bulgur wheat , 9 pounds of dried milk powder and a gallon of cooking oil every month . They , and millions of other Ethiopians , will die unless they continue to receive this food. // " There is this thing called donor fatigue , " Mr. Carlin said , " where people are tired of looking at hungry faces . The world community is looking for a short fix . Short fixes are just that , a patch-up job . In one year ' s time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition they were in 1984 , we ' ve done a tremendous job . But if we don ' t continue , you ' re just setting up to be back in the same situation we were last year . " <> <> Once Had Trees and Grass // There used to be trees and grass here in Harerge , people say . They say it was a place where animals grazed in the lowlands , where corn and sorghum flourished in the highlands . Today , highlanders and lowlanders alike flood the food distribution centers , where white 50-pound sacks of bulgur wheat are piled like pillows in newly built warehouses . Only seven months ago in Aydara , 70 percent of the children brought here by their mothers were clinically malnourished . Today , fewer than 20 percent are malnourished , and each month the condition of the children improves. // But it is clear from the growing number of people drifting into food centers in Harerge that without a continuous flow of food the situation will deteriorate rapidly. // " We have to have food from the distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Momino Fara . " We don ' t know what will happen . We expect everything from God. " //
