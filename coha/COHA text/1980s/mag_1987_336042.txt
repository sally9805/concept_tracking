One evening soon someone is going to go out in his backyard and grill a steak over charcoal made from the blackjack oak Ray Tune cut this morning in the Ozarks . <P> Ray is a woodcutter who lives near West Plains , Mo . He is 58 years old . He is 6 ft. 1 in. tall , a handsome man with a weathered face and a small mustache . He is in physical trim that a weight lifter would envy . Ray cuts wood every day , stacking six tons on his truck and unloading it inside one of the kilns at Craig 's Industries in Mountain View , Mo. , before the sun gets too high . He figures he lifts 24,000 lbs . a day . <P> When Ray began work , there was a half-moon in the dark sky , circled with a ring of moisture giving promise of the humidity to come . The whippoorwills were still calling , although a yellow-billed cuckoo was sleepily experimenting with his daytime songs . <P> Ray was in the woods with his one-ton Ford flatbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw , an 18-in. , yellow Swedish-made Pioneer , a thermos of water and another one of coffee . He was cutting wood on a ranch where loggers had taken the big timber . He had bought what they had left , tops from big trees and an occasional standing tree . He commenced work in a clearing the loggers had left surrounded by woods that cut off the breeze . <P> He cut several trees quickly and efficiently , not bothering with the notches a lesser woodcutter would have to use to direct their fall . He dropped each tree precisely where he wanted it , blocked up on underbrush , the butt end hinged by a sliver of the tree 's outer edge . He cut the heavier ends to 16-in. lengths to make them easier to load . Branches and tops were cut longer . He spent no more than ten minutes on a tree and walked surely through the brush with his chain saw running . <P> He stopped for a cigarette and coffee . Has he ever had any bad accidents ? " Well , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ear twice . And once a branch snapped back and threw the chain saw out of his hands , one of which was laid open ; at the same time , he twisted to avoid the running chain and hurt his back badly . He wrapped up his hand in a handkerchief and loaded the truck , but he could n't unload it because his back hurt too much . " Saw a doctor after I 'd put up with it for a week , and he popped my back into place so 's I was able to unload it . " Has he ever had back trouble since ? " No , never . " <P> Ray started to load what he had cut . He had put stakes in the truck bed to hold the wood in place , and he built up the load in one corner to 4 ft. high . He tossed in 100-pounders or more not quite as effortlessly as matchsticks ( he grinned after he chunked in a particularly big one , saying " Whew " in mock theatrics ) , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
