They did it with all the magic that carried them to 116 victories during the season and beyond , and that revived their fortunes after they had lost the first two games of the Series . And they shook Shea Stadium with roaring cheers , but with no postgame disorder , from the 55 , 032 people who watched the Mets bring down the curtain on one of the most successful seasons in baseball history. // They won their championship in the seventh game of the 83d Series and the 175th game of their baseball year , and they won it by sweeping the final two games with rousing rallies in late innings . They were two runs down in the 10th inning Saturday night , and scored three and won . They were three runs down to Bruce Hurst , the Red Sox ' starting pitcher , last night , but stormed back with three runs in the sixth and three more in the seventh , and won it all. // So , after finishing in second place for two years , the Mets fulfilled the mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominate " the big leagues. // After they had done exactly that last night , Johnson said : // " This is what it ' s all about , what we set out to accomplish . It wasn ' t easy . We went up against a formidable opponent . I ' m just happy the bad guys won . I ' m proud of those guys . It couldn ' t be any sweeter than it is . " <> <> ' We Were Destined to Win ' // " We were destined to win , " said Ron Darling , the Mets ' pitcher who threw two home-run pitches to the Red Sox in the second inning . " We were destined to win after finishing second the last two years . Somehow , some way , we got it done. " // " We had to win four out of five going to Boston one week ago , " said Keith Hernandez , who ignited the Mets ' comeback with a two-run single in the sixth inning . " But the ability to bounce back from adversity marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this club. " // " It is unbelievable , " said Roger McDowell , who became the winning pitcher even though he endured one damaging inning . " I have no idea how we kept rallying in the playoff and in the last two games here. " // Ray Knight , the Mets ' 33-year-old retread at third base who seemed to have no job or future last spring , was voted the most valuable player in the Series . He hit two singles and a home run last night , and ended the Series with nine hits in 23 times at bat for a . 391 batting average . He reflected on his own soaring fortunes , and said : // No Serious Intrusions But the passion was kept in check last night after Jesse Orosco struck out Marty Barrett to end the Series . Police officers appeared on the dugout roofs , the mounted police took up stations along the foul lines and the crowd stood and cheered . But it made no serious attempt to intrude , as many did last month when the Mets won the Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overrun and torn. // There was heavy intrigue as the game began . McNamara switched pitchers , as he said he would do late Sunday night . He bypassed Dennis ( Oil Can ) Boyd , who was knocked around for four runs in the first inning by the Mets in the third game . And he started Hurst , his left-handed ace who had beaten the Mets in the first and fifth games . Johnson countered by starting his right-handed hitting platoon , and even benched Len Dykstra , his leadoff " rabbit . " <> <> Bad Start for Mets // But , with all the platooning , the Mets got into urgent straits before the game was an inning and a half old , and they did it in a bizarre sequence. // Dwight Evans led off the second inning for the Red Sox , nearly struck out on a foul tip that eluded Gary Carter and then hit Darling ' s 3-and-2 pitch deep into the bleacher seats in left-center field for a home run . And the Red Sox had the lead. // Next came Rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base , where it skittered along the box-seat railing and caused a remarkable chain reaction . About a dozen fans leaned over the railing as the ball skimmed past and the railing gave way , dumping them onto the dirt track . The game was halted for almost five minutes while the ground crew repaired the railing. // Darling , who had tossed lightly during the wait , then delivered to Gedman , who nailed the first pitch to the fence in right-center . Darryl Strawberry ran back , leaped and got his glove on the ball over the fence . But he couldn ' t hold it , and the ball plunked over the fence for a home run and a 2-0 lead. // There was more . Darling then walked Dave Henderson , and got Spike Owen on a pop fly to the shortstop . Then Hurst dropped a bunt a few yards toward third base , right through the charging Knight . But Darling recovered the ball and made a strong throw to Tim Teufel at first base for the out . However , the bunt got Henderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boggs hit a ground single through the middle , and the Mets suddenly were three runs down . <> <> Barrett Ties Record // Before Darling got the side out , Barrett outran a bunt single and shared a piece of World Series history . It was his 13th hit , tying him with Bobby Richardson of the 1964 Yanlees and Lou Brock of the 1968 St. Louis Cardinals for most hits in a seven-game Series. // Darling , the 26-year-old history major from Yale , stayed until the fourth inning , when he was replaced by the left-handed Sid Fernandez . That proved to be a milestone for the Mets as their bullpen gave up no more runs until the eighth inning , and by then the game had turned toward the Mets . Fernandez led the way with two-plus innings of nearly perfect baseball . <> <> Hurst Protects Lead // Hurst protected his lead with another superb performance , including 11 batters in a row after a second-inning single by Knight . Then , with one down in the sixth and time slipping , the Mets took their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left field . Mookie Wilson lined the next pitch to left for a single , Mazzilli stopping at second . Teufel walked on five pitches , and the bases wee loaded with Hernandez swinging. // Hernandez , who played a starring role for the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1982 Series , remembered that he had sensed big things taking shape. // " I told my brother in the morning : ' I ' m swinging good . If I come up with people on base , I ' ll be a big part of this. ' " // And he was . He took a strike , then lined a long single to leftcenter , two runs scored and the Mets were suddenly only one away. // Then came Gary Carter , who looped a pop fly into short right field . Hernandez held at first and watched Evans sprint in for the ball , then saw him dive for it . Evans couldn ' t hold it , but he did get up and fire the ball to second , where Hernandez was tagged out . But Teufel meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game and back in the Series . <> <> Hurst Chased // One inning later , Hurst was gone ; one inning later , the tie was gone . In one more memorable rally , the Mets shot into the lead in the seventh. // The new Boston pitcher was Calvin Schiraldi , traded by the Mets to the Red Sox last winter . The first man he faced was Knight , who drove a soaring home run into the bleachers in left-center , and the Mets seized the lead. // Dykstra pinch-hit and singled to right . Then Schiraldi threw a wild pitch instead of a pitchout . When Rafael Santana bounced a single over first , Dykstra crossed and the Mets led by two. // Finally , with Joe Sambito pitching for the Red Sox , a bunt and a pair of walks gave Hernandez another shot . He lifted a sacrifice fly to center , and the Mets led by three. // But this was no night for the faint of heart . In the top of the eighth , the Red Sox came roaring back with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourth and final pitcher for the Mets and retired six straight batters . Then Darryl Strawberry unfurled a home run in the home half of the eighth , and the Mets soared to their championship. //
