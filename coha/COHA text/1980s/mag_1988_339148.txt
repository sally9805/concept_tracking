I saw in their eyes something I was to see over and over in every part of the nation  --  a burning desire to go , to move , to get under way , anyplace , away from any Here . . . Nearly every American hungers to move . <P>  --  John Steinbeck , Travels with Charley <P> Remember when getting there was half the fun ? When driving was a breeze and flying was a cinch ? No longer . Gridlock has gripped America , threatening to transform its highways and flyways into snarled barriers to progress . After returning from their summer jaunts , many travelers are looking back in anger at odysseys through potholed streets , jam-packed freeways , bottlenecked bridges and overstuffed airports . Now they face another season of grinding commutes : in many U.S. cities , the rush hour has grown into a hellish crush that lasts virtually from sunup till sundown . For U.S. businesses , the meter is running . Companies are losing money as employees fritter away their hours in a transportation standstill . Messengers fail to deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections and are unable to show up for the big pitch . Even expensive private jets get caught in holding patterns , leaving subordinates in limbo while their bosses circle overhead . <P> The congestion , which is certain to grow worse in the coming decade , is hampering Americans ' cherished mobility and changing the way they travel and do business . Instead of boasting I Get Around , the tune they are wailing nowadays is Do n't Get Around Much Anymore . Consider : <P>  --  The Detroit Tigers baseball team lost an important asset last week when its newly hired outfielder , Fred Lynn , failed to qualify for postseason play . Reason : he got caught in a traffic jam . Lynn was playing in Anaheim , Calif. , for the Baltimore Orioles when he accepted Detroit 's offer late Wednesday afternoon . But to qualify for the playoffs under league rules , he had to join the team , then in Chicago , by midnight . The Tigers chartered a jet for Lynn at Ontario ( Calif . ) International Airport , but rush-hour congestion reportedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That proved a costly delay : Lynn 's plane did not reach Chicago airspace until 12:10 a.m . <P>  --  The trucks that deliver Dean Foods products in the Chicago area were getting caught in such relentless traffic tie-ups that the company 's drivers ply the highways in the middle of the night . Many truckers leave for their rounds between 2:30 and 4 a.m . Says Larry Smith , chief of Dean 's trucking subsidiary : " By getting drivers ahead of the traffic , we believe we can reduce our cost and increase our productivity by 50% . " <P>  --  Bridget and Tom Hotchkiss of Evanston , Ill. , who returned in July from a slow-moving car trip to the Maryland shore with their sons Tommy , 6 , and Patrick , 3 , vow never to do it again . Says Bridget : " Ever since we got home , the boys have been playing a new game . They get out all their big trucks and all their cars . I hear them saying , ' Let 's play Traffic Jam .
