 | Just a few weeks ago Mexico seemed to get the boost it needed . After Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid met with Ronald Reagan in Mexicali , Washington pledged to help its southern neighbor raise the $4 billion in loans that the country said it needed for 1986 . But de la Madrid had based his calculations on the price of oil , Mexico 's main export and primary source of foreign exchange . Since then , OPEC 's production war has sent prices skidding from $22.50 to about $16 per barrel ? making it all but impossible for Mexico to service its $96 billion foreign debt . Mexican negotiators told their U.S. creditors last week that the country may now need an additional $9 billion to keep from defaulting on its loans . But that sum is probably just the opening bid in what promises to be a prolonged round of negotiations . U.S. commercial banks , which hold 26 percent of Mexico 's debt , are reluctant to lend much more money . Mexico and the International Monetary Fund are still far apart on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exchange for new austerity measures . The Mexican government contends it has done everything possible to stabilize the economy and can not afford any further tightening . Amid a series of strikes and popular calls for capping debt payments , Mexican Finance Minister Jesus Silva Herzog predicted last week that the current emergency could make the summer of 1982 ? the last time Mexico defaulted on its loans ? " look like a relatively calm and quiet period " by comparison . Silva Herzog now plans to meet with his American creditors one-on-one in an effort to convince them that Mexico 's economic policies are not to blame for the country 's latest borrowing needs . In fact , while the oil-price decline has helped other debtor countries that import oil , it could cost Mexico $4 billion or more in export earnings this year . Adhering to IMF demands , the Mexican government reduced inflation and cut back on imports in 1984 , but both rose again last year . Many U.S. bankers believe de la Madrid could have done more U.S. officials charge that during the election year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow and imports to rise . Meanwhile , with the peso continuing to slide in value , capital flight has accelerated ; an estimated $5 billion flowed out of the country last year , effectively recycling commercial-bank loans almost as fast as they came in . To combat the problem , lenders argue , Mexico should raise its domestic interest rates to provide a positive return to investors . Preferential rate : If Mexico can come to some agreement with the IMF , the banks may be willing to provide as much as $4 billion in new loans to tide the country over until next year . U.S. lenders are likely to balk at some of the other options now being discussed , such as canceling part of Mexico 's existing debt or giving it new loans at preferential interest rates . Another possibility would be to index payments to oil prices : if prices continued to slip , Mexico 's payments would fall as well . Mexican Foreign Minister Bernardo Sepulveda may angle for such terms when he meets with Secretary of State George Shultz this week . But Shultz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pushing Mexico to loosen up its protectionist policies and encourage more foreign investment to spur economic growth . If oil prices fall much further , such long-term solutions will seem increasingly academic ? and bankers could face a summer even more harrowing than 1982.
