While I was reading this book , my wife casually asked me about it . When I showed her the title , she asked suspiciously if " it was another one of your salacious books ? " And , given the title , which even the author admits to being " lurid , " one might think so . In fact , though , as I self-righteously told my wife , the book is about the sufferings of women 's bodies , or more accurately , the physical trials of women . However , Edward Shorter , professor of history at the University of Toronto , goes beyond merely documenting the sufferings of women in childbirth , underto all those who locate salvation elsewhere . The untroubled elitist , reading What Was Literature ? , is likely ? turning typically to French ? to he troubled by a strong sense of OM lu . What was it ? Then it comes back , All this about a man 's education into the anti-priggish worldly truth ; the love of " lucre , " and the love of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eliot , and the repeated adaptation of D. H. Lawrence 's " dirty little secret " ; the pseudo-confessions , the self-praises , the air of courageous candor along with the unnaming prudence ; the scorn for " the American anti-success story , " and the " realizing how in our world nothing succeeds like failure " : all this , and that one reiterated turn of phrase , snuffed by the hardest of hard noses : " the American dream of ' making it ' , " " the guilt we have long been trained to think of as the inevitable accompaniment of making it , " " aspiring to make it " . ... Of course ! So could it be that in the past Leslie Fiedler has published not only ( as he tells us ) under the name of " John Simon , " but under that of " Norman Podhoretz " ? the sexual assaults of husbands in the bad old pre-industrial days , and in the course of abortions . Shorter 's primary thesis is that women suffered more than men . His second is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor sense of self ; they accepted , until fairly recently in this century , that they were really not important . Third , he argues that it is because women were generally so sickly and so lacking in self-confidence that there was no feminist movement of much significance until the twentieth century . ( Indeed , on page 285 Shorter says that " this book began in an effort to find the origins of modern feminism . " ) And his fourth thesis is that around 1930 women 's health improved greatly . Shorter admits that " the evidence is , thus far , purely circumstantial , but it suggests to me that the first great wave of feminist enthusiasm that is , the achievement of women 's suffrage was made possible by the securing of good health for women . " T 0 MAKE HIS POINT that women suffered more than men , Shorter spends almost the entire book detailing ? and 1 mean detailing ? the myriad infirmities , atrocities , diseases , bloodletting , mutilations , and cruelties to which women have been subjected in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last several hundred years . Much of this , to be sure , is well known , though rarely has it been documented in such excruciating detail . One can here learn about the specific methods of abortion in the eighteenth century , the various ways of removing dead fetuses before Caesarean section was perfected , and the ways of killing fetuses when they could not be born naturally . Since only women give birth to children , it follows that no man can suffer what a woman does . There is only a half-hearted effort to discuss the gender-specific infirmities men suffered in the past ? principally diseases of the prostate gland . They , however , are quickly dismissed , since they did not hit men during the prime of life as women 's ills generally did . No mention is made of wars ; occupational , or industrial hazards ; or other social causes of specifically masculine morbidity or mortality . It is not that I want to award a prize for suffering to males rather than to females , only that I think comparative statements ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sion of suffering or from the different lives of men and women alerts us to the essential nature of this history . It is a medical , rather than a social history . As Shorter himself acknowledges at the outset , the preponderance of his sources are medical reports , largely those of physicians and hospitals . And that explains why the second and third theses are really no more than speculations . He makes no effort to show from historical records that women in the nineteenth and earlier centuries felt inferior because of their ill health ; he simply asserts it . For , in the end , he is not studying the reactions of the sufferers so much as the medical causes of the sufferings . Indeed , as soon as one tries to test in one 's mind his main point that feminism arose as a consequence of better health , doubts begin to surface . Was n't there a rather significant feminist movement in the United States in the nineteenth century , before women 's health improved ? Was n't there one in England and Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American , Australian , or Canadian frontiers too sickly to have a sense of their own worth ? is n't the subordination of women the result of a much more complex history than the physical suffering women endured ? Was suffering all that pervasive among them , or peculiar to them ? Apparently Shorter senses these weaknesses in his thesis , for he is at pains to dispute one familiar piece of evidence against his case , namely , the common view that women live longer than men , and always have . For if women 's sufferings have been as severe as his admittedly anecdotal evidence suggests , how is it that women have managed to live longer than men ? His handling of this apparent anomaly is , I think , a little slippery . First of all , he concedes that " in the past , female life expectancy on the whole ended up slightly higher than male . " That , of course , is also the present pattern , though today it is more than " slightly higher " ; white women in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the average , than white men . Shorter , however , does not want to accept that general advantage for women , for to do so would weaken his case . What he does then is to ask if there were any ages during which female mortality was higher than male . And , of course , there were : the years between ages five and twenty and between 30 and 40 for married women . He contends that these periods of vulnerability for women were more important than the years when males were most vulnerable ? such as soon after birth , or after 35 . He then seeks to account for these periods of greater vulnerability for women by examining the various diseases or conditions that may have put women at greater risk than men . One might think that his point would be that women 's bodies were a part of the cause inasmuch as only women give birth , hut , as he candidly admits , the statistics will not support that simple conclusion . In the end , he has no explanation . He condudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for inexplicable reasons , the greater vulnerability of women than men in certain age groups to disease had come to an end " ( emphasis added ) . All of which brings us back to his fourth thesis that early in the twentieth century women 's health dramatically improved and feminism flourished thereafter . What did this improvement consist of , aside from a lowering of mortality ? Primarily it was the result of easier births for women , and availability of Caesarean sections , and abortions . The year 1930 , in Shorter 's estimation , marks not only the onset of a better deal for women in childbirth , but also a better deal for babies . Shorter argues that doctors first became concerned about the fetus only in the 1920s ( even though he certainly must know that the medical profession was behind the anti-abortion legislation of the nineteenth century ) , What this " discovery " of the fetus meant was that women , who Shorter claims were at that time just on the verge of gaining control over their bodies , lost that control to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother 's life to producing healthy babies . ( Actually , women 's control was still far in the future , since abortion was then illegal . ) To achieve that goal , all phases of preg nancy had to he controlled by the medical profession and births had to take place in hospitals rather than in homes . " In return for surrendering their autonomy , " Shorter concludes , " women today receive pink , brisk babies . Nobody dies . And the ' birth experience ' is valued as a basic part of womanhood , - he says perhaps too emphatically , but largely correct Iv . Now we come to Shorter 's methods of research and analysis . On one level the hook is remarkable for the thoroughness of the research behind it ? some sixty pages of hacknotes in very small print , twenty-eight pages of appendices to support the various tables in the text , historical literature and statistics drawn from many countries and written in at least five languages . Despite the volume and variety of his evidence , however , Shorter fails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again and again he supports a general point either by a report from a single hospital or physician , or by evidence from different countries and at different times , none of which , of course , is standard historical procedure . For example , in trying to show changes in the causes of deaths in childbirth . he constructs a series drawn from Baden , Germany for 1864 to 1866 , New York City , 1930 to 1932 , and the United States in 1976 ! Of course the figures show that there were changes over time , but one must wonder if the conclusion has validity since it is drawn from three different places under quite different circumstances . To assume , as Shorter does , that evidence from any one country can show what was happening in any other country or city , that the different history or circumstances of those various locales had little or no effect upon the women who lived and suffered in them , is to violate traditional methods of historical analysis , Cultural context is fundamental in all social historical explanations or descriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have us , that a Latvian folk saying reveals anything about how the British or Americans felt about women , or sex , or life ? In addition to his overt theses , Shorter also has a covert one . It is that modern feminists have misread the history of women . This point comes through most obviously in the argument that a feminist movement emerged only in the twentieth century , though most of us thought that the beginnings , at least in the U.S. , were early in the nineteenth . Beyond that are Shorter 's several references throughout the book to the ways in which midwives mishandled childbirths and how women lacked any control over childbearing , all in pointed contradiction to some recent feminist assertions . CHORTER 'S revisionist view , as well Li as his method , raises questions . So , even more , does his failure to examine the underlying assumption of his hook , namely , that human values are derived or shaped by material things . Hardly unique with Shorter , this kind of argument is frequently made in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such reasoning goes , that sparked a new conception of the world or of ideas . Shorter puts it this way : " It is impossible that these momentous changes in medical practices have been without impact on the way women view sexuality , the pleasures of raising children , and the nature of their relations with men . " Yet the causal relation may not he that simple . We know , for example , that changes in technology are often not accidental , but frequently arise out of social needs ; they are often the result of changes in social values rather than being themselves the source of those changes . We also know that technical innovations can come forward as accidents , but if the social soil is inhospitable they do not develop further ( as happened with the steam engine in antiquity ) . In sum , rather than seeing the improvement in women 's health as a source of feminism , it seems much more likely that a rising self-awareness among women ? and a new concern among men for women ? caused doctors to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus to alter their behavior . Shorter himself comes close to making this point when he shows that the shift from home to hospital for births resulted largely from women 's recognition that a hospital was safer for them . Certainly there is good reason to believe that the legalization of abortion in the late twentieth century came about not because men wanted it . but because women in a growing woman 's movement insisted upon it . And though today it is common to trace the origins of the so-called sexual revolution to the invention of the Pill , technical control over births is much more likely to be improved because people want to limit fertility rather than the other way around . We know , for instance , that during the nineteenth century when average family size declined by 50 percent in the United States , no new contraceptive devices or information were being disseminated . Rather , the search for better contraceptives was sparked by a shift in values that long preceded the Pill . The point is that medical history can help us to understand how particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much valuable information on that . By itself , however , medical history , insofar as it is a history of techniques , can not persuasively account for social movements , such as the rise of feminism . The connection between material changes and values can not be demonstrated by simply describing the former and assuming their social and psychological impact on human beings ; it must he done by looking into the documents left by those human beings , that is , into those sources that give us Fame , wealth , talent , and glory do n't guarantee happiness . There needs no ghost come from the grave to tell us this , but should anyone have forgotten , this book provides a useful reminder . In my time , a handful of people have appeared on the comedy scene who are without peer . If they cancel on you , you ca n't get someone else just like them . Mike Nichols , Elaine May , Mort Sahl , and Jonathan Winters leap to mind ; people whose brilliance makes them unique . Where Have I Been ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a mysterious and complex man who seems to have been singled out by the gods to set two all-time records , one of dubious and unenviable distinction : to have set the high-water-mark for sustained comic brilliance over a long period of years , and to have ingested enough booze and pills to kill the Lippizaner stallions . The twin mysteries of how anyone gets so talented and how anyone could abuse himself so disastrously remain unsolved . To have combined the two and survived is a miracle . And the medal for Heroic Performance by a Wife goes to Florence Caesar . Many drunks and pill-swallowers can point to a specific moment in their decline when they realize they have hit bottom ? that the choice is either the grave or recovery . So with Sid . Our story opens in a depressing make-shift dressing-room ( far beneath the noble Caesar 's dignity ) in a hotel in Saskatchewan where he is doing the play clues about what was going on in the heads and hearts of the people whose values changed .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
