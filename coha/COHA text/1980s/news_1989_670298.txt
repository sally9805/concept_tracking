TAX-FREE SPINOFFS come under new rules that could inhibit takeovers . The IRS has issued long-awaited final rules for corporate spinoffs of subsidiaries free of tax for both companies and their stockholders . One requirement  --  that holders as a group keep at least a 50% " continuity of interest " in both parent and spun-off unit  --  blocks these rules from being used to avoid tax on other asset distributions . But this new proviso could hinder many friendly and hostile takeovers , says Gilbert Bloom of Peat Marwick Main , CPAs . For example , Bloom says , it no longer will be possible for one holder in a parent to have it buy out the others by spinning off 100% of a subsidiary in a tax-free exchange for all their stock in the parent . The rule also could be used in a takeover defense : A company threatened with hostile takeover could spin off a unit to its holders tax-free  --  noting that the spinoff would become taxable if they sold all their parent-company stock to the raider . The rules apply to spinoffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the nursery , if you want a child-care credit for 1989 . While 1988 returns aren ' t affected , it may be good to look now at new rules , effective in 1989 , for taking dependent-care credits or the income exclusion for care benefits provided by employers . To qualify for either , 1989 returns will have to list all care providers ' names , addresses , and Social Security or employer numbers . One way to get the information is to ask providers to fill out new Form W-10 , which spells out the rules and is available from the IRS . The W-10 is for your records , not part of a return . But if your return gives wrong information , you can avoid losing your tax benefit by showing the form to prove " due diligence " in trying to get correct data . Instead of a W-10 , the IRS also will accept a copy of a provider ' s Social Security card , driver ' s license , letterhead , invoice , W-4 withholding-tax form , or employer statement  --  if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York on sales taxes could set a national standard . Indians on reservations are exempt from states ' sales taxes . But states ' efforts to collect taxes on reservation sales of cigarettes and gasoline to non-Indians have led to many clashes with tribes . Now New York and the Senecas have agreed , subject to legislation , to have the tribe impose taxes on cigarettes and motor fuel in place of state taxes . Seneca taxes would be lower , but would slash non-Indians ' incentives for evasion and block any wholesale flow of untaxed products through the reservation . The 10-year agreement would bring the tribe up to $10 million a year in tax revenue . State and tribe would exchange enforcement data . Seneca President Dennis Lay says the pact " resolves our common concerns while protecting the sovereignty of the Seneca Nation . " The pact , with its " in-lieu tax , " is a breakthrough in state-Indian relations , says Suzan Shown Harjo of the National Congress of American Indians .

The college is to pay $6 , 000 of the annual interest to the couple until they both die or the bond matures . The rest of the interest and , at maturity , the principal are to go to a college endowment fund . The couple asked the IRS whether they could take a charitable-gift deduction , and it replies in private ruling 8851030 . There is a catch in the couple ' s plan : The $6 , 000 annuity would be payable specifically from interest on the bond their gift would buy . Thus , notes the IRS , they would retain an interest in the gift ; that rules out any charitable deduction on their gift-tax return . Still , the IRS adds , they can cure the problem by having the annuity paid from general college funds .
