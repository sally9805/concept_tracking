Fouts , who holds several National Football League passing records , has injuries to his left wrist and right thumb and to the rotator cuff in his right shoulder . He did not play last Sunday , when the Chargers lost to the Denver Broncos , 14-6. // His injuries could not have come at a worse time . The Chargers have fallen to 3-5 after consecutive losses to the New England Patriots and the Denver Broncos , and so many other Chargers are injured that even a healthy Fouts would be hard pressed to bring a victory over the Redskins. // This week the Chargers listed 13 players on their injury report . Among those with the more serious problems are Chuck Muncie , the team ' s best running back , who missed the game against the Broncos because of a groin injury ; James Brooks , the other regular running back , who has a pulled hamstring ; Wes Chandler , the league ' s leading receiver last season , who was hit in his kidney in the game against the Broncos ; Bob Gregor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two games with a sore knee ; Don Macek , the center , who has a sore neck , and Eric Sievers , a reserve tight end who has an injured ankle. // Fouts ' s absence gave Ed Luther , a fourth-year quarterback from San Jose State , the first start of his career against the Broncos . He had only limited success , completing 22 of 48 for 193 yards . Three of his passes were intercepted and none went for touchdowns , and Luther moved the offense only well enough to enable Rolf Benirschke to kick two field goals. // In training camp Luther expected to be the starting quarterback . Fouts and the club were at a standoff in negotiations for a new contract , and it appeared that Fouts would again sit out . Several days after Fouts had signed , Luther expressed ambivalence : He was happy for Fouts and the team , and unhappy for himself . He also indicated that at some point he might have to choose between sitting behind Fouts a few more seasons and joining a team that would use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Right now , " Luther said yesterday from San Diego , " I ' m just thankful for the opportunity to play . I can ' t concern myself about the future . I have the opportunity to play now , and I want to take advantage of it. " // The Redskins would seem to be an ideal team for a quarterback to exploit Despite their 6-2 record , the Redskins are tied with the Giants for the worst-rated pass defense in the league . In each of seven games , the opposing quarterback has thrown for 225 yards or more ; in half the eight games , for 275 or more. // Part of the reason may be that teams have had difficulty running on the Redskins . The Raiders ran for 105 yards against them , but no other team has run for 100 . And , with injuries to Muncie and Brooks , it is not likely the Chargers will , either. // Here is a look at the other games , all Sunday : // Local Teams Dallas Cowboys ( 7-1 ) at Giants ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After their first loss of the season , by 40-38 to the Raiders last Sunday night , the Cowboys play six consecutive games against teams that now have nonwinning records . The Giants have won the last two times these teams met at Giants Stadium , in 1980 and 1981 , and played well earlier this season , when the Cowboys won , 28-13 , at Irving , tex . The Giants need to exploit the Cowboys ' secondary , as the Raiders did for 300 yards. // Jets ( 3-5 ) at San Francisco 49ers ( 6- 2 ) , Channel 4 , 4 P.M. - The 49ers scored 4 touchdowns in the fourth quarter to defeat the Rams last Sunday , 45-35 , and had a season-high 358 passing yards . The Jets have yielded 215 passing yards or more in each of their last three games , all losses . The Jets and the 49ers have met only three times , the last in 1980 , and the 49ers have won each game. // American Conference Houston Oilers ( 0-8 ) at Cleveland Browns ( 4-4 ) - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win any games this season . They had a chance to defeat Kansas City last Sunday , but Florian Kempf missed a 41-yard field goal with 4 seconds left in regulation , and they fell in overtime , 13-10 , their 15th consecutive loss . The Browns lost a 21-14 lead by allowing the Bengals to score twice in the fourth quarter , the second time on the return of an interception of a pass from Brian Sipe . Sipe , who has had 17 passes intercepted , most in the league , has been replaced by Paul McDonald . The Oilers are tied with three teams for the fewest interceptions in the league , 5. // Seattle Seahawks ( 4-4 ) at Los Angeles Raiders ( 6-2 ) - The Raiders made Marc Wilson ' s first start of the season a last-gasp victory over the Cowboys . But it left unsolved one mystery : Why has Marcus Allen been ineffective ? He is averaging 61 rushing yards a game , and Frank Hawkins , who ran for 118 against the Cowboys , is not likely to have that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after trailing by 24- 0 at the half . The Seahawks will need to improve all facets of their offense , especially their running , which produced 57 yards. // Kansas City Chiefs ( 4-4 ) at Denver Broncos ( 5-3 ) - The Broncos are the weakest team in the league with a winning record . Four victories were from teams that have losing records , including the Chargers , who lost to them Sunday , 14-6 . Even so , they have now won all three games with Steve DeBerg at quarterback . The Chiefs drew a bad team , the Oilers , when they needed one the most . With an offense that can do little other than pass , the Chiefs won with good defense and a field goal in overtime , 13- 10. // National Conference Detroit Lions 3-5 ) at Chicago Bears ( 3-5 ) - The Lions played their worst game of the season last Sunday , losing to Washington , 38-17 , with rushing and passing that generated less than 100 yards each . Their defense allowed 28 points in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season in a 7-6 victory over Philadelphia. // Minnesota Vikings ( 6-2 ) at St. Louis Cardinals ( 2-5-1 ) - The Vikings are improving in the one area that could be most bothersome to the Cardinals : defense against the run . In each of the last three games , all victories , the Vikings have reduced rushing yards allowed , to the 87 by Green Bay last Sunday . A key for the Cardinals may be how Neil O ' Donoghue fares on his first field-goal attempt . He missed his last three , all in the overtime period against the Giants , resulting in a 20-20 tie. // Interconference New England Patriots ( 4-4 ) at Atlanta Falcons ( 3-5 ) - The Patriots have won two consecutive games , the second a shocker , 31-0 over the Bills . This could lead one to believe that the Patriots , after one of their best defensive efforts of the season , are a cinch to defeat the Falcons , who overcame a 21-0 Jet lead to win , 27-21. // New Orleans Saints ( 5-3 ) at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saints ' victory over Tampa Bay , 24-21 , is misleading because their defense gave up only 2 touchdown runs and 141 total yards . The Bills have beaten only one team that now has a winning record , Miami , in overtime . Buffalo ' s defense is giving up large amounts of passing yardage , which may place a burden on a sputtering offense. // Tampa Bay Buccaneers ( 0-8 ) at Pittsburgh Steelers ( 6-2 ) - The Buccaneers neither ran nor passed for 100 yards against the Saints , and their line allowed Jack Thompson to be sacked 7 times . The Steelers have one of the best defenses in the league . The Buccaneers did well to limit Ken Stabler ' s passing yardage to 60 . With Cliff Stoudt substituting for the injured Terry Bradshaw , the Steelers have again become a running team , and they are running well. // Baltimore Colts ( 4-4 ) at Philadelphia Eagles ( 4-4 ) - The Eagles ' defense played so well in a 7-6 loss to Chicago that a repeat performance could mean a shutout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of their last three games , and they played poorly last Sunday in losing to Miami , 21-7 , in the mud at Baltimore . Because the Colts are a young , inexperienced team , they can best serve themselves by figuring out what they did earlier in the season , when they won three consecutive gamest . As a safeguard against that , the Eagles need a better game from their line , which must provide more protection for Ron Jaworski and bigger holes for the running backs. // Los Angeles Rams ( 5-3 ) at Miami Dolphins ( 5-3 ) - The Dolphins have improved their run defense to some degree this season , but they may need to make a quantum leap against the Rams . Eric Dickerson finished the first half of the season with 995 yards , putting him in good position to eclipse O. J. Simpson ' s single-season record of 2 , 003. // Green Bay Packers ( 4-4 ) at Cincinnati Bengals ( 2-6 ) - The Packers completed the first half of the season consistent only in their inconsistency . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the opposite the next . If form holds , they will defeat the Bengals . But Cincinnati surprised the Browns last week , 28-21 , by playing outstanding defense , which included scoring the winning touchdown on the return of an interception. // //
