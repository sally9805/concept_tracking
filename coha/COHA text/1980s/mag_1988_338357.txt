From the halls of Montezuma to the beaches of Grenada , the U.S. Marines have depended more on the courage of individual fighting men than on fancy combat gear . But in an era of smart bombs and guided missiles , even the Leathernecks are reaching for high-tech equipment to get the job done . Last week the Corps unveiled a revolutionary " tilt-rotor " aircraft designed to dominate the modern battlefield . Known as the Osprey , it will take off and land vertically like a helicopter but fly as fast as a conventional plane . It will do all this , the Corps proclaims , by tilting its 38-ft. propellers , which point upward during takeoffs and landings and forward in level flight . <P> For all its marvels , the Osprey has at least one drawback : its price , up to $35 million a plane , is two to six times as much as the price of the CH-53 or Black Hawk helicopters that some officials say could do the job .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
