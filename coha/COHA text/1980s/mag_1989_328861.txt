Although elections for the European Parliament may still be more symbolic than substantive , the balloting shattered British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's image of invincibility last week . Her Conservative Party suffered its first national defeat in nearly 15 years , capturing only 34.7% of the vote and losing 13 of its 45 European Parliament seats . By contrast , the left- leaning Labor Party totted up 40.2% , stirring dreams among Laborites of ousting Thatcher from power at home . <P> In West Germany , Chancellor Helmut Kohl 's Christian Democrats received a blow as the new right-wing Republican Party , led by a former sergeant in Hitler 's Waffen-SS , won 7% of the vote by capitalizing on fears of competition from foreign workers . <P> Elections for the Strasbourg-based assembly , once consigned to the status of a European debating society , are fast becoming a bellwether for European politics . Thatcher aides sought to downplay the Tory defeat by arguing that the culprit was domestic discontent with Britain 's 15% interest rates and 8.3% inflation . Even critics within her own party scoffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when Europe is moving toward economic integration in 1992 . Said a Tory backbencher : " She got it drastically wrong . " <P> Across Western Europe , the biggest gains were won by Green parties , which nearly doubled their representation , to 39 delegates . The environmentalists thus hold the balance of power in the 518-seat chamber , ensuring that their issues will be high on the European Community 's agenda . West Germany 's well- established Green contingent will be joined by delegations from other E.C . countries , including France and Italy . In Britain the Greens captured an impressive 15% of the vote but no seats because Britain does not have a proportional-repre sentation system . <P> As E.C . leaders hold their first postelection summit in Madrid this week , the big question is whether Thatcher 's weakened position will cause her to be more conciliatory on two key proposals : a social charter intended to safeguard workers ' rights and , more important , the eventual establishment of a single currency managed by a European central bank . Emboldened by the erosion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to press on toward European unity , whatever her objections .
