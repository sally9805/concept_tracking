The new system represents the biggest change in Medicare since the health insurance program for the elderly was created in 1965. // Hospital officials said it would give them strong new incentives to control costs and to reduce the length of stay for Medicare patients . But they also warned that the new system could make it more difficult for some patients to get medical services. // Erie D. Chapman 3d , president of the 1 , 092-bed Riverside Methodist Hospital in Columbus , Ohio , said : " Hospitals will have an incentive to keep costs down . That economic incentive simply has not been there until now. " // // // Cost at $50 Billion in ' 82 // Medicare costs have increased to $50 billion in 1982 from $7. 5 billion in 1971 , in part because the program has always paid hospitals for all reasonable costs , including room and board . Under the new system , a hospital can keep all the money it saves by holding its costs below the prices fixed by the Federal Government . By the same token , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Medicare patient in excess of the amount set by the Government. // <> <> Hospitals as ' Factories ' // R. Allen Vaughan , director of financial services for the Arizona Hospital Association , said the new payment system was " causing a reaction from the hospitals dissimilar to anything that ' s happened in 20 to 30 years. " // Specifically , he said : " Hospitals are looking at themselves as factories producing product lines . In the past , the system discouraged hospitals from holding down costs . Now they are faced with the same type of marketplace incentive that many other businesses have always faced. " // The new system takes effect when a hospital begins its next fiscal year , on or after Oct. 1 . For now , the system applies only to Medicare , which accounts for 30 percent of all hospital admissions and about 36 percent of hospital revenues . But many hospital administrators , doctors and Government officials believe that a similar system will eventually be adopted for other patients , including those treated in doctors ' offices. // The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rates are set in advance , regardless of how long a patient is hospitalized or how many services are required. // The average length of stay for all hospital patients is 7. 6 days , according to the American Hospital Association . For Medicare patients , who often have multiple illnesses and a slower recovery rate than younger patients , the average length of stay is 10. 3 days , according to the Government. // The new system rewards hospitals that keep detailed , accurate medical records so they can identify the procedures on which they are making or losing money . Joan Sackett , manager of medical records at the 360-bed Scottsdale Memorial Hospital in Arizona , said : " The system dictates that you be computerized . One description of prospective payment might be computers , computers , computers . " <> <> Patients to Be Classified // Each Medicare patient will be classified in one of 467 categories , known as diagnosis-related groups . The 467 groups include , for example , tonsillectomy , heart attack , hypertension , kidney transplant and pneumonia . The Government will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // At first , the rates will combine factors specific to each hospital with the average price for all hospitals in the region . But over three years the individual hospital factor becomes less important as the system moves toward standard rates nationwide , which are scheduled to take effect in October 1986. // Margaret M. Heckler , the Secretary of Health and Human Services , plans to publish the Federal rates Thursday . But Peter J. Schonfeld , executive vice president of the 201-bed Henrotin Hospital , a nonprofit facility in Chicago , said the system was already " creating confusion for financial and program planning. " // " These are the most significant changes in Medicare since its inception , but there ' s been little advance information about the final regulations , " Mr. Schonfeld said . " We ' re trying to make decisions about our services in a logical business fashion , but Medicare hasn ' t given us their share of the information pertinent to the decisions we must make . " <> <> ' System Is Creating Havoc ' James E. Truett , controller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " The new system is creating a great deal of havoc right now . It ' s very difficult to plan . All we have is speculation and rumor as to what we ' re going to be paid for this business. " // Health costs have been rising faster than the Consumer Price Index for more than a decade . Hospital room rates rose 13. 3 percent last year , compared with an increase of 3. 9 percent in the index for all items. // Medicare spending has increased at an annual rate of nearly 18 percent since 1970 . With no change in current law , the Medicare trust fund would run out of money around 1990 , according to Government actuaries. // Medicare protects 26 million people who are 65 years old and older . The cost of the program is expected to rise to $75 billion in 1985 , even with the new method of paying hospitals. // Amid the uncertainty , hospital officials made these observations and predictions about the new system : // // - Robert Sillen , executive director of the Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a " bottom-line financial mentality " would lead some private hospitals to discourage the admission of severely ill patients . Theodore Fourkas , a spokesman for the California Hospital Association , noted that the prospective payment system did not take into account the severity of an illness . Hence , he said , " There will be a financial incentive for hospitals to admit patients who need less care and to turn away the sickest patients. " // // - William A. Bell , general counsel of the Florida Hospital Association , said hospitals would encourage physicians to do more tests on an outpatient basis before admitting people to the hospital . In the past , hospital officials worried about doctors doing too many tests . Now , they said , there will be pressure on the doctors and the hospitals to do too few. // // - Under pressure to shorten hospital stays , hospital administrators said they were making formal arrangements with home care agencies , nursing homes and other institutions to take their convalescent patients . William M. Hermelin of the American Health Care Association , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clearly there is going to be greater demand for our services. " // // - Hospital administrators said they would have to work more closely with physicians to help them control the use of hospital services and the length of time patients spend in the hospital . Administrators said they would not interfere with decisions about the treatment of a patient , which remains the doctor ' s responsibility . But many administrators said they would monitor and supervise the doctors more closely. // Carl H. Iseman , an administrator at the University of Cincinnati Hospital , said , " We will prepare a profile of each physician to compare the costs he incurs in treating his patients with the regional and national norms . " <> <> Focus on Doctor Education // Martin E. Drebin , senior vice president and treasurer of the Evanston Hospital Corporation in Illinois , said : " The focus has to be on educating doctors on the new system . None of us wants hospital management to control doctors ; administrators can ' t second- guess doctors on procedures . You don ' t want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , if the cost continues to exceed payment , the hospital may have to abandon that particular procedure. " // Hospital officials said the economics of the new system would force them to abandon some of their least profitable services . Lawrence S. Goldberg , director of financial analysis for the American Hospital Association , said , " Hospitals will specialize in services and procedures that they can perform most efficiently. " // The 36 general hospitals in Connecticut all begin their fiscal year on Oct. 1 and are hurriedly preparing for the new system . Four states , New York , New Jersey , Maryland and Massachusetts , have received waivers exempting them from the new law because they have their own cost-control systems . But they may not spend any more for Medicare patients than they would have received under the law . <> <> System Based Jersey Experience // Starting in 1980 , New Jersey introduced a prospective payment system . New Jersey ' s experience with standard payments for each case and each type of illness was used by the Federal Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country . However , New Jersey allows more variation in prices among hospitals than the Federal system will allow. // The Federal changes do not affect Medicaid , the medical assistance program for poor people , which is financed jointly by Federal and state governements. // New York State has had a prospective payment system for Blue Cross and Medicaid patients since the mid- 1970 ' s . In January of this year , Medicare patients were brought into the system . The New York State Health Department sets an overall limit on the revenues that a hospital can receive from all sources , including private insurance companies . The state also sets a flat rate for each day that a patient is hospitalized , regardless of the patient ' s illness. // The new Medicare payment system was adopted by Congress last March as an amendment to a bill shoring up the finances of the Social Security System . The debate over Social Security obscured the profound changes in Medicare. // //                 @ @ @ @
