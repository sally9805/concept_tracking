txt Acme-Cleveland Corp . will incur a fisea I fourth-quarter charge of around $5.2 million before taxes for costs or relocating some production from Cleveland to lower-cost plants elsewhere , B. Charles Ames , president and chief executive officer , said . The relocation is part of an effort to reduce the company 's costs and make its machine tools and expendable cutting tools more competitive , Mr. Ames said . Earlier efforts have reduced the company 's breakeven point to about $260 million of annual sales from about $310 million 18 months ago , he said . As a result of the plant relocation charge and a $600,000 charge for the devaluation of the Mexican peso . Acme-Cleveland probably will have a net loss of $2 million to $3 million for the fourth quarter , ending Sept. 30 , Mr. Ames said in an interview .

Ainsworth Jr .. vice president and treasurer . The company has about $40 million currently , but will pre-fund certain pension and insurance obligations for next year before Sept. 30 , he said . Fiscal fourth-quarter sales will drop to $55 million from $91.2 million a year earlier , Mr. Ames estimated .

For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million , down from $400.7 million in fiscal 1981 , Mr. Ames said .
