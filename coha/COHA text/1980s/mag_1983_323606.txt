In SoHo , a trio of rising reputations but uneven talents <P> There were three one-man shows on the itinerary of most gallerygoers in New York City 's SoHo area last month : Robert Longo , David Salle and Grard Garouste . Taken together , they were fairly instructive . Here are three rising , though by no means certified , reputations ; yet their success seems tinged with panic . They are all young ( Longo is 30 , Salle 31 , and Garouste 37 ) and , of course , figurative - the pendulum of taste having now swung so far that it is practically impossible to have a rising reputation if you are a new abstract painter . Each , in his way , is a perfect subject of the " postmodernist " image machine , that powerful contraption which , modeled on corporate p.r . lines , has transformed the very nature of reputation in the art world over the past five years . But how good are they ? <P> Certainly Longo is the best of them . But his ambitious split show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , displays a worrisome unevenness : harshly accurate feeling one moment , bombast the next . Longo 's subject is people under stress ; in his paintings , the lid on the urban pressure cooker is always about to blow . He began to make a reputation two or three years ago with life-size figures of men and women apparently in their late 20s , starkly drawn in graphite on a blank ground , twisting and grimacing and staggering . They were , of course , done from photos ( only the camera can cut movement into such inscrutable , violent morsels ) , and their power lay in their uncertainty : Were the people getting shot , having strokes or dancing at the MuddClub ? <P> Longo is not without entrepreneurial desires . He staged performances , did sculpture and is producing a full-length film , Empire . His art got more ambitious , involving more people both in his pictures and as assistants in the studio . We see the results at Castelli and Metro . They include a large bas-relief in aluminum depicting a horde of struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , flanked by ominous , smooth , black effigies of skyscrapers in perspective that recall the architectural renderings of Hugh Ferriss in the ' 30s . The trouble is that the execution does not carry the theatrical idea . Longo is not much of a modeler ; his striking talent for rendering does not extend into three dimensions , so that on closer inspection the faces and bodies in the sculpture are pedantically inert , like those " solid photography " busts cut with a laser device . <P> On a less operatic scale , however , he is convincing . Perhaps the best work in the show is Pressure , 1982-83 : the white face of a worried , singlet-clad mime in the lower half and , above it , the cold , oppressive ziggurat of an art deco-style New York building . The film noir dramatics of Longo 's work are tuned down , and a subtler pathos comes through , the surprise being that Longo was able to extract it from such obvious cliches as the Urban Clown and the Faceless Skyscraper.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
