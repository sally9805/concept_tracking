The Israelis besiege Beirut to await a truce-or a showdown <P> As U.S. Special Envoy Philip Habib and leaders of Lebanon 's warring factions sought desperately to concoct a truce , the roar of tanks and the thump of artillery fire threatened to make a mockery of their efforts . The 60,000-strong Israeli force , still trying to consolidate its control over southern Lebanon , advanced to the outskirts of Beirut . There the Israelis linked up with Christian Phalangist allies to impose a stranglehold over 6,000 Palestinian guerrillas and 1,500 Syrian soldiers trapped inside the western part of the city . <P> The encirclement began when a tentative cease-fire between the P.L.O . and Israel broke down only nine hours after taking effect .

" <P> The Syrian rebuff effectively ended a tenuous four-day truce between the two armies . Heading north from their fortified positions in Baabda , Israeli armor cut the Beirut-Damascus highway just west of Jamhur , less than a mile from Syrian tank and infantry posts . By seizing Beirut 's surrounding hilltops , the Israelis choked off all main supply and exit routes for the Syrian and Palestinian units remaining in the capital .
