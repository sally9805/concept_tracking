In the lobby of Building No. 391 at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory near San Francisco stands a cast-iron sculpture of Shiva , the multiarmed god whose whirligig dances , according to Hindu tradition , alternately create and destroy all earthly life . Near by is a wood-and-plastic model of Nova , the world 's most powerful laser , which is housed in cavernous quarters the size of a football field . The juxtaposition of the two objects is apt , and for several reasons . Like Shiva , the $176 million laser bristles with its equivalent of arms : ten bright blue tubes , each a conduit for an intense laser beam . And like Shiva , Nova will dance to a schizophrenic tune : it could benefit life  --  and perhaps help to destroy it . <P> After the giant laser is dedicated in a ceremony at Livermore this week , scientists will employ its intense beam of light in an attempt to weld the nuclei of hydrogen atoms , releasing bursts of energy at temperatures exceeding those at the center of the sun . Should they succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward a limitless supply of cheap , clean power . " Once we crack the problem of fusion , " says John Emmett , associate director for lasers at Livermore , " we have an assured source of energy for as long as you want to think about it . It will cease to be a reason for war or an influence on foreign affairs . " <P> As the second step in Nova 's dance , however , weapons designers will put its powerful beams to a less benign purpose : to improve thermonuclear bombs by mimicking certain reactions in the controlled setting of a laboratory . That will save the Pentagon the expense of having to try out every newly designed bomb at an underground test site in Nevada , a procedure that costs about $10 million per explosion . Eventually , Nova could also be used in research for the Star Wars defense program . <P> The awesome might of fusion energy can be explained by Albert Einstein 's famed equation , E = mc 2 . When two nuclei from hydrogen atoms are shoved together to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their individual masses is converted into a tremendous amount of energy . In weapons , that energy is uncontrolled and destructive . To channel it into a usable form , scientists must be able to control the fusion reac- tion and confine it to a chamber , which requires surmounting some formidable physical constraints . The hydrogen nuclei must be crushed together with enough force to overcome their mutually repellent positive electric charges . In H-bombs , that force is supplied by the detonation of a fission bomb , or A-bomb . <P> But A-bombs can not be exploded in power plants , and when Lawrence Livermore scientists begin their experiments six weeks from now , they will use powerful laser beams instead . In Nova , under the guidance of more than 50 computers , a pulse of light is whipped around a master oscillator until all of its wavelengths are identical and in phase . The pulse of pure laser light is then split into ten parts , each of which races down its own 460-ft. - long tube equipped with amplifiers , spatial filters and isolators . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ width of three human hairs , yet is a thousand trillion times brighter than the sunlight that falls on the earth . Together they deliver 100 trillion watts of power , about 200 times the present electricity-generating capacity of the U.S. , albeit only for a billionth of a second .
