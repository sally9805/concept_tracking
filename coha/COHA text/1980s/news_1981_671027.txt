" Listen , " he said over an Italian lunch at Il Nido , " when I get up in the morning I have to decide what I ' m going to have for dinner or I can ' t get through the day . When I get to a hotel that I ' m going to be in for more than a day or two , I go to the kitchen and introduce myself to the chef and then send him a bottle of Scotch or really fine brandy , and I ask him what he ' s got that ' s especially good. // " And when I ' m in Los Angeles , as I am one week of every month , everyone I work with takes care of arranging meetings and business matters and I arrange dinner . Food there is getting better now that they have so many New Yorkers. " // Growing up during the Depression in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn , Mr. King , as Alan Knaiberg , ate plenty of food , albeit hardly the French , Italian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One thing I ' ve never said in my whole life , " he remarked , " is ' Let ' s have dinner at a Japanese restaurant. ' " ) // His parents came from Poland and his mother cooked kosher food . " But my father only observed those rules in the house to please her , " he said . " Outside , he was an elegant eater who picked a lobster apart meticulously . Everything my mother made had to cook for 80 hours , and when she made matzoh balls she didn ' t know fluffy . Everything sank . Some things were good though , and I visited her and my father recently in Florida and she cooked great corned beef and cabbage. // " Her brisket and boiled beef are wonderful , " Mr. King continued . " I make boiled beef the French way or in an Italian bollito misto and it ' s good , but her beef somehow is better . At home we always ate dairy for lunch and meat for dinner . Lunch was a sandwich of egg salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Mr. King began his adventures as an eater at large when he left home at 14 to do singing impressions with the Major Bowes amateur road company . Gradually weight became a problem for him and now , to keep in shape for the camera , he usually skips breakfast and lunch . " Except on the weekends , " he said . " Sunday morning I go to Tabatchnick ' s in Great Neck for belly lox. " // No smoked salmon ? " Smoked salmon is for dinner , " he replied . " Belly lox is for breakfast . Don ' t get that mixed up . My favorite way to spend Saturday is in and out of bed , watching sports on TV and eating . And I always get up to eat at 3 in the morning . I love to eat salami and cheese and I make eggs all kinds of ways. " // During the lunch at Il Nido , Mr. King , who has grown a beard for his role as a Broadway producer in the film " Author , Author , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to lose weight over the next few weeks. // Contemplating the creamy tortellini and spinach ravioli malfati in front of him , he decided that a couple of weeks was a long way off . He said that his new film had two great eating scenes , one gorging in a Chinese restaurant , the other when he is forced to eat health food , a prospect he is not looking forward to. // Just how difficult that scene would be was made clear by his wife , Jeanette . " In the 34 years that we ' ve been married Alan has always been a wonderful normal eater , " she said . " So are our sons . But my daughter , Elainie , and I are nuts about food - macrobiotic vegetarians . Once I had some whey cheese in the refrigerator and Alan went down in the middle of the night and ate some . He came running upstairs screaming that he had been poisoned ! " // Asked if she worried about his health , Mrs. King said no . " His mother is in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' re both fine , " she added . " They never stopped salting anything or cut down on fats . Please God , Alan will do the same. " // A star-struck star , Mr. King observes his own rituals about restaurants he favors . " I always go to Chasen ' s on Sunday night when I ' m in Los Angeles , never any other night , " he said . " That ' s because the first time I went it was Sunday and Clark Gable and Carole Lombard were in the first booth . Who could forget a thing like that ? And in London I always go to the Connaught on Sunday night. " // Recently in Paris , he visited Lasserre , where he felt the service was especially attentive because they thought he was Bob Hope . " And I loved Taillevent even though there ' s lots of nouvelle cuisine there , " he went on . " But they don ' t make it too fancy for me because they know I ' m not a cuisine man . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I admire rose sculptures in museums , I don ' t like them on my plate. " // About restaurants , Mr. King said : " I ' ll sacrifice some cooking skill for a really beautiful place with a friendly staff . That ' s why I love Grenouille , where everyone is lovely and the flowers are so gorgeous . I eat out about four nights a week and one night is always at Grenouille . I like Il Nido too and I also go to ' 21 . ' I check in there every day , and when I ' m eating alone I sometimes go to Pearl ' s or Elaine ' s. " // " Those places are my clubs , " he said . " My people are there . They cook a few things I like , but I really go to see what ' s happening . I hate to eat alone . If I go to Elaine ' s alone she will sit with me or I ' ll meet someone I know . Lutece is fabulous , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go there . I love the Russian Tea Room because lunch there is a Jewish wedding . You can go from one table to another and pick up on the conversation. " // He said he never goes to a restaurant he has not been to before . How does he get there for the first time ? " I never remember , " he replied // He thinks of restaurants as theater . " The greatest one to watch was Henri Soule at Pavillon , " he said . " When I had a date there I used to arrive 15 or 20 minutes early so I could watch him . As a producer I appreciated what he was doing as he walked around that room touching a roll here and there or a flower . Great meals don ' t just happen , you know . Someone has to make them happen , and he was a tyrant , which is what it takes . After all , if I ' m going into battle , I don ' t want Eisenhower for a general . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I learned to cook in self-defense . My wife doesn ' t know what a kitchen is . In the first month of our marriage she broiled lamb chops 26 nights in a row . Then I took over . I used to mind her not caring about food , but no more - as long as I can eat what I want. " // Because he eats in restaurants so often and has a cook in his Kings Point home , Mr. King prepares meals on weekends or for company . " My greatest pleasure is to cook for a sit-down dinner for 10 or 12 people. " he said . " That ' s a challenge because you have to get everything done at the right time . And with me the name of the game is ' I like it hot . ' Let the food cool off in front of me. " // Describing himself as a saute man , Mr. King said : " I like to see all of the ingredients cooking out in the open so I can know what ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick . I ' m a short-order gourmet . I like lots of flame and heat and have a Garland gas stove . Lately I ' m getting interested in roasting - especially chickens like the ones that fantastic chef , Antoine Magnin , does at L ' Ami Louis in Paris . That chicken he does really takes me away . He showed me how he roasts it , then sautes it in butter to get the skin crisp. " // Potatoes made at that old Paris bistro also inspired Mr. King . " I learned how to do them , " he said . " You cut the potatoes and put them in a pan with plenty of chicken fat , oil , garlic , salt and pepper , and roast them in the oven . But I don ' t use olive oil , though I like that too . But olive oil with chicken fat grows hair on your teeth. " // He prefers cooking shrimp , chicken and veal . " And don ' t tell me where to get the best steak , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like knowing who makes the best martinis or who is the best dentist . They may be the best , but who cares ? " // " I don ' t like veal to be too thin , " he went on . " A paillard always dries out . I like it to be between half an inch and threequarters of an inch thick and I know 82 ways to cook it . When I go to La Grenouille , Mme. Masson orders a special thick veal chop for me. " // Having ordered a veal chop a la King in advance , we found it to be a one-and-a-quarter-inch loin chop , sauteed golden brown in butter with cloves of garlic . The pan was deglazed with white wine to produce a silken , sheer golden sauce , and sprigs of fresh thyme and a bay leaf added their perfumes. // " One thing I don ' t like is moderation , " Mr. King said . " I don ' t like a small side salad or a little piece of pastry after a meal . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all by itself . And I don ' t eat ice cream unless I can have a gallon. " // " As life ' s pleasures go , food is second only to sex , " he said , pausing briefly to think it over . " Except for salami and eggs , " he added . " Now that ' s better than sex , but only if the salami is thickly sliced and if you put ketchup on the eggs and have a toasted bialy. " // Asked if he missed any New York restaurants that have closed over the years , Mr. King said that in addition to Pavillon he liked Cafe Chambord , on Third Avenue , and Cafe Chauveron , on 53d Street , both owned by Roger Chauveron. // " But I also miss places around Times Square , " he said . " I miss the cheesecake at the Turf and eating pastrami and talking to Max Asnes at the old Stage Deli. // " And I remember what it felt like to see Jack Dempsey at the table in the window of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damon Runyon at Lindy ' s and Billy Rose at Dinty Moore ' s . I never got over the thrill of finally being able to afford to go to those places . I guess I miss food and history . I guess what I really miss is Broadway . " <> <> Roasted Garlic Potatoes <> <> 6 large old boiling potatoes , peeled and cut in quarters Salted water , for boiling 1 tablespoon rendered chicken fat ( schmaltz ) 1 tablespoon light vegetable oil 1 head of garlic , peeled , with cloves lightly crushed Salt and freshly ground black pepper , to taste. // 1 . Place potatoes in salted water to cover and bring to a boil for two minutes . Drain thoroughly and cool. 2 . Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 3 . Spread film of chicken fat and oil over the bottom of a heavy baking pan in which potatoes fit in a single layer . Add crushed garlic cloves. // 4 . Roast in preheated oven for about 45 minutes or until potatoes are golden brown and tender . Remove garlic cloves if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn potatoes several times during roasting . Add a little more fat or oil if pan seems dry. // 5 . Sprinkle potatoes with salt and pepper and stir to distribute seasonings evenly . Yield : 4 servings . NOTE : Mr. King said that he usually makes these potatoes when he is roasting meat or chicken . As the potatoes begin to brown , he bastes them with the juices that accumulate in the roasting pan . Sometimes he uses lard instead of the chicken fat and oil. //
