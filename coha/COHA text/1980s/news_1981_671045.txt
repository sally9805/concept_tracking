But since Smith College acquired an 86-acre parcel here three years ago to provide a buffer around its small observatory , the land has become the focus of an unusual lawsuit with possible implications for the survival of Smith and other colleges in the state as institutions for women only. // In the dispute , which was argued before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court earlier this month , Whately has charged that Smith should be stripped of its tax-exempt status because it violates the state ' s Equal Rights Amendment by admitting only women as undergraduates . Smith , in turn , has found itself in the awkward position of contending that the state amendment , which bars discrimination on the basis of sex and is similar to the proposed Federal equal rights amendment , should not apply to a private women ' s college. // // Other Schools Concerned // Wellesley College , Mount Holyoke and Wheaton , three of the state ' s prestigious women ' s schools , joined Smith in filing briefs before the state court . They are concerned that the case could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as undermine their unique attraction at a time when college administrators fear the pool of college applicants will soon shrink nationwide. // Under pressure from the women ' s movement and changing social mores , the number of all-male colleges in the United States has declined over the last decade to 13 , seven of them run by the Roman Catholic church . However , 114 colleges still admit only women. // The conflict here arose after Whately , population 1 , 300 , forwarded Smith a $450 tax bill for the scrub land around the observatory , asserting that it was not being used for an educational purpose . Smith refused to pay and also rebuffed a compromise proposal that , in lieu of taxes , it give the town $200 a year for services. // Of the nation ' s colleges , Smith , with an enrollment of 2 , 650 and an endowment of $129 million , has one of the highest ratios of endowment to students . <> <> Suit Called ' Rather Silly ' // One resident , Merit P. White , a laconic white-haired man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinks the town ' s assessors were " rather silly to institute the suit . " For , he recognizes , even if Whately won the court battle , the $450 a year in taxes would not cover its legal costs. // But , said Mr. White , who is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Massachusetts in nearby Amherst , " It also seems ungenerous of Smith not to do anything for the town when it is such a small sum . " Whately plows the road to the college ' s observatory in winter , he pointed out , and , if there was an accident or fire , the college would expect the town ' s volunteer police or fire departments to come to the rescue. // Some other townspeople are wondering why Smith has gone to so much trouble and expense to avoid paying anything to Whately . To argue its case before the state court , Smith hired Robert Meserve , a Boston lawyer widely regarded as the dean of the Massachusetts legal profession . Ann E. Shanahan , a spokesman for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college has spent on legal fees. // Jill Conway , the president of Smith , said the points at issue in the litigation " are important ones for the entire higher educational community. " // " They concern the right of private educational institutions to tax exemption and the right of private educational institutions to set their own admissions policies , " she said . <> <> Smith Won Early Round // But Edward W. Pepyne , the Whately Town Counsel , maintains that Smith should lose its tax exemption just like private clubs that discriminate on the basis of sex. // Mr. Pepyne said he had brought the suit after Smith won a decision from the State Appelate Tax Board that the land around the observatory was being used for education and therefore qualified for tax exemption. // Referring to Smith ' s presentation to the tax board , Mr. Pepyne said , " They argued that they were a trust set up for the purpose of educating young women . " But , he continued , " these days you can ' t talk only about young women or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state E.R.A. " // Smith ' s attorney contended in court that the Equal Rights Amendment did not apply to the college because it was a private rather than a government institution , Mr. Pepyne noted . But , he remarked , " you couldn ' t get out of Northampton alive arguing the E.R.A. has so little meaning . " Smith itself is in Northampton , 10 miles south of Whately. // Mrs. Conway , who was a professor of American history at Harvard University before she came to Smith six years ago , would not comment on the litigation but strongly defended the continued need for women ' s colleges . She contended that in a coeducational school women were less likely to major in the sciences or mathematics and to get fair representation in the leadership of student government or other activities , such as the school newspaper. // In contrast to its refusal to make any financial contributions to Whately , Smith did pay $128 , 000 to Northampton last year as taxes on property that is not considered for educational use , such as the faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sensitive subject in Massachusetts because many communities are suffering from a 1980 state referendum that sharply reduced their revenue from land taxes. // The observatory itself appears to be used infrequently . The 20-foot-high dome over the green-and-white building is covered with a foot of snow , and the 500-foot path leading from the road into the observatory is blocked by snow and fallen pine branches. // Whately ' s battle with Smith is not the first incident in which the town has jousted with outsiders . In the 1960 ' s it fought to stop construction of Interstate 91 , a highway that runs through the town . When Whateley lost , the Government evidently took revenge by not building an exit ramp into the town. // Byron Canney , one of Whately ' s three selectmen , is pessimistic about the state court ' s ruling , which is expected in two to three months . He admits the town may have little legal standing to sue Smith over sex discrimination . Smith ' s attorney has argued that only a man denied admission can do that. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little guy is not going to win , " Mr. Canney said. //
