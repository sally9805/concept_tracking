Around noon on October 28 , 1963 , five people  --  two men , two women and a child  --  sat down to midday dinner in the kitchen of a house they shared on a tobacco farm in the Caney Valley hills of Hawkins County , Tennessee , about 15 miles southwest of Kingsport . They were ( I 'll say ) Homer Mason and his wife , Louise ; the latter 's sister and her husband , Grace and Leroy Smart ; and the Smarts ' son , a boy of three called Buddy . Mason and the two women had spent the morning in the barn stripping and bundling cured tobacco leaves for the market . Smart had had other work to do , and it was he who prepared the meal . It consisted of split-pea soup , spaghetti with meat sauce , sliced tomatoes , sweet milk and corn bread . Mason was the first to finish eating . He told his wife and Mrs. Smart that he would meet them down at the barn . He was going to stop by the cowshed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house and crossed the yard and suddenly began to stagger . He lurched against a tree . The barnyard tilted and the sky reeled . For a moment , Mason clung to the tree , and then it , too , began to shook his head . Something was happening to his eyes . The house was hardly 50 yards away , but he could only just make it out . He seemed to be going blind . So did Mrs. Smart . When Mason stumbled into the kitchen , she was sitting there at the table with her head in her hands and moaning . Her husband stood beside her . Mrs. Mason stood on the other side of the table with Buddy in her arms . He was staring at his mother and whim-pering . Mason dropped into a chair , and Mrs. Smart raised her head . " Homer , I ca n't hardly see , " she said . " I think I 'm going blind . " " Me , too , " Mason said . " And I 'm dizzy , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , and everything was just spinning . I felt like a drunk woman . " " She like to fell , " Smart said . " I had to catch her . " " Same here , " Mason said . " I feel the same way . " " Then it is n't just me , " Mrs. Smart said . " I thought it was just me . Because Leroy feels all right , and so do Louise and Buddy . " " You 'll be all right , honey , " Smart said . " Everything 's going to be all right . " " I do n't feel as good as I did , " Mrs. Mason said , and abruptly sat down . " There 's something funny in my head . I feel kind of goofy . " Mrs. Smart gave a little wail . " Oh , my gosh ! " she said . " I even feel sick to my stomach ! What is it , Homer ? What 's the matter ? " " I do n't know , " Mason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's three of us do n't feel right  --  you and me and Louise . And there was only just the three of us working down in the barn this morning . " He stopped and licked his lips . They felt stiff and cracked , and his mouth was dry . " Maybe we 've got tobacco poisoning , " he said . " We 've all of us got the nicotine stain on our hands . Some of it maybe come off in our food . " " I never heard of tobacco poisoning , " Smart said . " I have , " Mrs. Smart said . " Oh , my gosh , Homer . What are we going to do ? " Mason looked at Smart . He could see him , but his features were out offocus , and there was something moving just above his head . It was like a play of light and shadow  --  or a cloud of smoke . It became a swarm of bees . They swarmed silently around and around and around . " Leroy , " Mason said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor . " The medical needs of Caney Valley residents are served by a middle-aged general practitioner whom I 'll call Francis Craig and a young associate whom I 'll call Henry Rath-bone . These two physicians operate a clinic at Church Hill , a roadside village about midway between Kingsport and the Mason farm , and it was there that Smart drove his wife and son and the Masons . They arrived at the clinic at two o'clock . " I was alone that afternoon , " Dr. Rathbone says . " Dr. Craig was in Kingsport at the hospital  --  the Holston Valley Community Hospital  --  making rounds . Lucy , our nurse , called me on the interoffice phone and said that five people had just come in from Caney Valley . Three of them , she said , were acting very strange . She sounded rather agitated . I was with a patient , but I finished up as quickly as I could . Lucy is n't a flighty girl . I went out to the waiting room  --  and she was entirely correct . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jerking and moaning , and one of the men  --  Mason , it turned out to be  --  was waving his arms and talking a wild blue streak of gibberish . I thought for a minute that he was simply scared . But then 1 looked again . He was peering into space and making grabs at the air , and I realized that scared was n't it at all . He was hallucinating . The other man , the man named Smart , came up and introduced himself and told me what he could about the matter . I gathered that his wife and Mason had been taken right after eating . Then , a little later , Mrs. Mason took sick . Smart and his little boy , however , were perfectly all right . The symptoms , as I made them out , were vertigo , blurred vision , dry mouth , generalized weakness , nausea and  --  in Mason 's case , at any rate  --  hallucinations . Smart added that his wife and the Masons had spent the morning stripping tobacco . He wondered if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him no on that . Tobacco poisoning could only be nicotine poisoning , and that could n't happen from that kind of superficial contact . But they had almost certainly been poisoned . My guess was food poisoning  --  food intoxication . And , to judge from those clearly central-nervous-system symptoms , it was something pretty serious . " Smart helped me get his wife and the Masons into the examining room . Mason really needed help . He could n't even stand alone . We got him stretched out on a cot as comfortable as possible and settled the two women in chairs . The blurred vision they all complained of was easy to understand . They all had widely dilated pupils  --  very glassy-looking . The immediate problem , as far as Mason and Mrs. Smart were concerned , was nausea . They were sick as dogs , and , to make matters worse , they both had an insatiable thirst . I gave them each an intramuscular injection of trimethobenzamide hydrochloride . That seemed to help the nausea a bit , but it was obvious that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so wild it was hard to keep him from falling off the cot . He kept reaching for imaginary doorknobs , as if he wanted to get out of the room . Sometimes he would be fighting off a swarm of bugs . Then at times he seemed to calm down , and he would point across the room or up at the ceiling and say something about all the beautiful flowers . But most of the time , nothing he said made any kind of sense . And Mrs. Smart was almost as bad . She was beginning to hallucinate , too , and raving and thrashing around in her chair . It was unnerving . I really did n't know what to think . Or , rather , there was only one thing I could think of , and that possibility was almost too frightening to contemplate . I mean botulism . Botulism , as you probably know , is the most dangerous of the bacterial food poisonings . It has a mortality rate of about 65 percent . It is also , of course , a pretty rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , it had happened right here in eastern Tennessee  --  in Knoxville  --  only a couple of weeks before . There were seven cases in the outbreak , and two of them were fatal . So botulism was more or less on my mind . I did n't have far to reach . I thought of it the minute I saw those central-nervous-system symptoms . " I do n't mean to say I was certain . Not at all . There were several points that did n't quite fit a diagnosis of botulism . The onset , for one thing , seemed a little too sudden . And the symptoms were not exactly right . The central-nervous-system symptoms that Mrs. Smart and Mason had were much more pronounced  --  more violent  --  than the centralnervous-system symptoms that are classically characteristic of botulism . But they were close enough . They were certainly too close to ignore . Botulism can be treated , you know . There 's an antitoxin , and if it 's given in time , it can make all the difference . Dr. Craig agreed with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts and asked him what he thought , and he was n't for taking any chances , either . He proposed that I call the ambulance service and get them right into the hospital . I was glad to take his advice . " Mason and Mrs. Smart were carried into the emergency room of the Holston Valley Community Hospital in Kingsport at five minutes after four . Mrs. Mason arrived at 4:15 with Smart and his little boy . They were received by Dr. Craig and ( such was his aversion to taking any chances ) three hurriedly recruited consultants  --  a neurosurgeon ; the hospital pathologist , Dr. William Harrison ; and an internist whom I 'll call Richard Johnson . Both Mason and Mrs. Smart were now wildly delirious and almost totally helpless . They were also deeply flushed , dry of mouth and tormented by an unquenchable thirst , and Mason was shaken by frequent muscle spasms . Mrs. Mason , however , was still only weak , dry-mouthed and vertiginous . The emergency-room examination was diagnostically uninstructive . Mason 's pulse rate was 100 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mrs. Smart 's was 88 , or only slightly faster than normal for a woman , and both had a temperature of 99 degrees . Mrs. Mason had no fever , and her pulse rate was normal . All three had widely dilated pupils that reacted sluggishly to light . The results of the other routine tests  --  blood pressure , blood count , urinalysis  --  were normal in all three cases . " I think we were all inclined to accept Dr. Rathbone 's first impres sion , " Dr. Johnson , the internist , says . " The trouble was obviously some kind of poisoning . What kind was hard to say . It looked like botulism , and yet it did n't . Hallucinations and disorientation very seldom occur in botulism , and when they do , they tend to be rather late-developing symptoms . Still , it was n't a possibility that any of us were willing to rule out of the picture entirely . Even a hint of botulism is unsettling . We were standing there in the emergency room and feeling very unsettled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son and came over . He said his little boy was complaining about his eyes . Everything looked funny , Buddy said . That sounded like what had happened to his wife and the others , so he thought we ought to know . Also , Smart said , he was n't feeling too good himself . His eyes were all right , but he had a cramping pain in his stomach , and he was beginning to feel a little nauseated . Well , that decided us . Botulism antitoxin is n't something you can get at any drugstore . Or at any hospital , for that matter . There is n't that much demand for it . The nearest possible source we could think of was the Poison Control Center at the University of Tennessee Memorial Hospital , in Knoxville . Robert Lash , the director of the Center , had laid in a supply of antitoxin during the botulism outbreak they had over there earlier in the month , and maybe some of it was left . I went to the phone and gave Dr. Lash a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had several hundred thousand units on hand . He said he would get it off at once by a special highway-patrol messenger . It was now about a quarter to five . We should have it by seven o'clock . " It took Dr. Lash about ten minutes to arrange with his dispensary and the Tennessee highway patrol for the dispatch of some /I " 500,000 units of polyvalent botulinus antitoxin to the Holston Valley Community Hospital . He then returned to his desk and put in a call to Nashville  --  to Cecil B. Tucker , director of the Division of Preventable Diseases of the Tennessee State Department of Public Health , in the Cordell Hull State Office Building there . Botulism is a communicable disease and , consequently , a notifiable one . In Tennessee , as in all other states , its appearance ( proved or suspected ) must be reported to the state health authorities for prompt investigation . When Dr. Tucker came on the line , Dr. Lash gave him the required report . " I was n't as startled as I might have been by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Botulism was no great novelty in Tennessee that month , you know . My only thought was something like ' Here we go again . ' I thanked him and hung up and put in a call to Kingsport  --  to Dr. Johnson . I wanted a few more facts before sending an investigator up there . But 1 had Dan Jones standing by . Dr. Jones is an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer assigned to us by the U.S. Public Health Service through its Communicable Disease Center , in Atlanta . I got Dr. Johnson , and he described the cases . He gave me the clinical picture and what he could of the epidemiology , and 1 began to have my doubts . It just did n't sound like botulism . But that , of course , was only an opinion . Botulism was still a possibility , so we had to go and see . I told Dr. Johnson that Dr. Jones would be up there in the morning and started to say goodbye:And Dr. Johnson said , ' Wait a minute . ' I waited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , ' he said . ' One of the doctors here has been talking to one of the patients , and he says he just mentioned something about eating Jimson weed . ' I do n't remember what I said to that . Except that I would call him back . " Dr. Jones had heard what I heard . He was listening in on an extension . We lit out down the hall and up the stairs to the chemical lab . That 's where we keep our file on poisons . I pulled out the card on Jimson-weed poisoning , and no wonder I 'd had my doubts . I 'll read you what it says under ' Symptoms and Findings ' : ' Pupils dilated , dry burning sensation of mouth , thirst , difficulty in swallowing , fever , generalized flushing , headache , nausea , excitement , confusion , delirium , rapid pulse and respiration , urinary retention , convulsions . ' It was almost word for word the clinical picture that Dr. Johnson had given me on the two patients more seriously stricken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Johnson on the phone again and told him what we had found . I said it very much looked to me as though Jimsonweed poisoning was the answer to his problem . Dr. Johnson said he thought I was right . They had done some checking themselves , he said , and they had come to that same conclusion . " Jimson weed ( or stinkweed , or thorn apple , or devil's-trumpet ) is a big , hardy , cosmopolitan annual of Asian origin . It is known to science as Datura stra-monium and is a member of the large and generally noxious Solana-ceae , or nightshade , family of plants . Other mem-bers of this family in-clude tobacco , horse nettle , henbane , bella-donna , the petunia , the tomato and the Irish potato . All these plants , including the tomato and the potato , are at least in some respects pernicious . Jimson weed is entirely so . Its leaves , its seeds , its flowers and its roots all contain a toxic alkaloid called hyoscyamine . Hyoscyamine is closely related to atropine and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed throughout most of the United States . It made its first appearance here in the early 17th century , possibly as early as 1607 . Some authorities think it may have been introduced in ballast and other rubbish discharged from the ships that landed Captain John Smith and his fellow Virginia colonists at Jamestown in that year . In any event , it seems reasonably certain that it entered this country there . Early records indicate that the Powhatan Indians of coastal Virginia called it the " white man 's weed . " The white colonists of Virginia and elsewhere , on the other hand , called it " Jamestown weed . " Robert Beverly refers to it as Jamestown weed in his History and Present State of Virginia , of 1705 , and gives a recognizable , if somewhat excessive , depiction of its hallucinatory powers : " This being an early Plant , was gather 'd very young for a boil 'd salad by some of the Soldiers . . . and some of them ate plentifully of it , the Effect of which was a very pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several Days . One would blow a Feather in the Air ; another would dart Straws at it with much Fury ; and another stark naked was sitting up in a Corner , like a Monkey grinning and making Mows at them ; a Fourth would fondly kiss and paw his Companions , and snear in their Faces , with a Countenance more antik than any in a Dutch Droll . In this frantik Condition they were confined , lest they in their Folly should destroy themselves ; though it was observed that all their Actions were full of Innocence and Good Nature . Indeed , they were not very cleanly ; for they would have wallow 'd in their own Excrements , if they had not been prevented . A Thousand such simple Tricks they play 'd , and after Eleven Days , return 'd themselves again , not remembering anything that had pass 'd . The other names by which Jimson weed  --  which is , of course , a corruption of " Jamestown weed " ? is sometimes known are more conventionally descriptive . They call attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plant gives off a fetid smell ; its fruit , or seed pod , is barbed with thorns , like a chestnut bur ; and its poisonous flowers  --  milky white and sometimes streaked with purple  --  are trumpet-shaped . Jimson weed is in every sense a weed . Like beggar's-lice and tumbleweed and the cocklebur , it flourishes almost everywhere and is everywhere detested . It sprouts early ( as Beverly noted ) , it grows fast , and it blooms until late in the fall . Its size , for an annual , is considerable . It often reaches a height of six feet , and it averages around four . Like most other successful weeds , Jimson weed can exist on even the poorest land , but its existence there is no more than dogged survival . It does well only in fertile soil , and when it finds itself so placed , it feeds voraciously  --  as voraciously , and as destructively , as corn or cotton . It is also , however , among the easiest of weeds to control . A couple of swipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed will clear the most firmly established Jimson-weed jungle . Its presence on cropland or in pasture is thus traditionally taken as a sign of indifferent farming . Mark Twain was aware of its reputation , and in Tom Sawyer , he turned it to effective atmospheric use : " She Aunt Polly went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the tomato vines and jimpson ' weeds that constituted the garden . " Livestock are repelled by its smell , which is so rank that only animals addled by hunger are rash enough to ignore it . Jimson-weed poisoning in livestock is almost entirely limited to the ingestion of hay or ensilage accidentally contaminated with Jimson-weed seeds or leaves , and such cases are relatively few . Man is less instinctively prudent . Most people find the smell of Jimson weed distinctive , but it frequently fails to repel them . Jimson-weed poisoning in man , though hardly commonplace , is anything but rare . " During the past five years at the University of Virginia Hospital , which services a large southern rural area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients admitted because of ingestion of a toxic substance , " Joe E. Mitchell and Fred N. Mitchell , both members of the Department of Pediatrics of the University of Virginia School of Medicine , reported to the Journal of Pediatrics in 1955 . " Although distinctly less frequent than kerosene or salicylate intoxication , Datura has had about the same incidence as lead , barbiturates , alcohol , rodenticides and insecticides as a source of poisoning . " Jimson-weed poisoning in children can usually be laid to innocence . The seeds are mistaken for nuts or are used in play as " pills . " Its adult victims are more variously poisoned . Some of them are victims of homespun credulity ( folk medicine recommends a tea of Jimson-weed leaves for the relief of asthma , constipation and certain other ills ) , and some are victims of a credulous sophistication ( the street-corner pharmacopoeia recommends Jimson-weed seeds for a liberating hallucinatory experience ) . A few of them  --  including , as it turned out , Homer Mason and his family  --  are victims of simple ignorance . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room of the Holston Valley Community Hospital that October afternoon in 1963 said " something about eating Jimson weed " was William Harrison , the hospital pathologist , and the patient was Leroy Smart . That was n't , however , exactly what he said . " I 'd been talking to Smart about the meal he had fixed that noon , " Dr. Harrison says . " I wanted to know just what had been eaten and just how it had been prepared . It bothered me . I do n't mean I had any ideas . It was only that Mason and Mrs. Smart had taken sick almost immediately after eating . That was a little suspicious . Either that or a rather odd coincidence . But the trouble was , of course , that ordinary bacterial food poisoning does n't act that way . It does n't come on that fast . It takes hours , and even days . The same is true of most other kinds of food poisoning . About the only poisons that hit in a matter of minutes are chemical poisons , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce are nothing like those we had here . So I was simply floundering . But something I said must have struck a chord in Smart . His whole expression changed . Come to think of it , he said , there was something he had n't thought to mention about that meal  --  something a little unusual . The tomatoes they 'd had were n't ordinary tomatoes . They were grafts . They were grown on a tomato stalk that Mason had grafted onto a Jimson-weed plant . He wondered if that might have had anything to do with the trouble . " That was when I spoke to Dr. Johnson . I knew he was talking to Nashville , and I thought they ought to know . The way he heard it was a little confused . Or maybe I was a little confusing . I probably was . I mean , I knew without any question that Jimson weed was the answer . It answered all our questions  --  the centralnervous-system symptoms , the sudden onset after eating , everything . But the whole thing was so fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be extremely serious . It can be fatal . Still , almost anything is preferable to botulism . And not only that . It relieved our minds about Smart and his little boy . The late onset of their symptoms suggested a mild exposure . The same was largely true in the case of Mrs. Mason . Her symptoms were somewhat delayed , and they were also relatively mild . In fact , in the end we did n't even admit those three to the hospital . It was different , of course , with Mason and Mrs. Smart . They were really sick . They did n't seem to be in critical condition , but they certainly needed hospitalization . We put them to bed and started them on a course of oral pilocarpine , a nerve stimulant that would serve to counteract the action of the toxin on their vision by stimulating the parasympathetic nerves . But that was about all we could do for them . There is no specific treatment for Jimson-weed poisoning . " I had another talk with Smart just before he left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , but I was interested  --  intensely interested . Smart was with his son and Mrs. Mason . Dr. Craig had given her ten milligrams of pilocarpine for symptomatic relief , and she seemed to be in pretty good shape . I was particularly interested in the nature of the tomato graft . Smart could n't help me on that . He said I 'd have to talk to Mason , since Mason did all the gardening . He was able to tell me the why of it , though . It was really a bright idea . Mistaken , to be sure , but most ingenious . Mason wanted a hardy , frost-resistant tomato  --  one that would ripen late in the fall . And he knew that Jimson weed was a hardy , frost-resistant plant that flourished until well into November . So he put the two together . He was right , too . The graft was completely successful . As a matter of fact , Smart said , that tomato they ate at dinner was the very first fruit of the experiment . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a good-sized , good-looking tomato , he said , and it had a good flavor . It tasted like any good home-grown , vine-ripened tomato . He had eaten one slice , and so had his wife and Mrs. Mason . It was possible that his wife 's slice had been one of the big center slices . His own had been an end slice , and Buddy 's had been only a sliver . Mason , on the other hand , had eaten three or four slices . " I looked in on Mason the following morning . He He looked a little surprised . What idea ? The idea of grafting the tomatoes ? Why , that was n't his idea . He got it from a friend  --  a fellow over in the next valley . I 'll give him the name of Clayton . Clayton had been growing tomatoes on Jimson-weed grafts for years . He had always been fooling around with plants . " Well , that was an interesting piece of news . It was flabbergasting . And it raised some flabbergasting questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or had Clayton never been poisoned ? And if he had n't been poisoned , why not ? And so on . It was some little time before we got any answers . By ' we ' I mean the State Health Department , the Hawkins County Health Department and the interested doctors here at the hospital . The first step was one that would have been taken in any case . Somebody from the county went out to Mason 's farm and got a sample Jimson-weed tomato and sent it in to Nashville for analysis . Then Clayton was interviewed . He confirmed what Mason had said . He and his family had been growing and eating Jimson-weed tomatoes for years  --  since 1958 , to be exact . No , he never sold any . There were only enough for home use . They ate them raw , they ate them stewed , and they ate them canned . And without any ill effects . The very idea that they might be poisonous astonished him . He , too , had never heard of Jimson-weed poisoning . As it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crop of Jimson-weed tomatoes , but he was glad to give the investigator a couple for analysis . " We got the report from the laboratory sometime the following week . This report made rather curious reading . It raised as many questions as it answered . It fully confirmed the cause of the Mason family 's outbreak . They were victims of Jimson-weed poisoning . There are no exact data on the toxicity of hyoscyamine , the principal stramonium alwas still sick , still flat on his back , but he seemed to be perfectly rational . Except , I should say , on the subject of his tomatoes . He knew what had happened . Somebody on the staff had already told him the cause of the family outbreak . But he did n't quite believe it . He had never heard of Jimsonweed poisoning . Jimson weed was a weed like any other weed to him . I did n't argue with him . We just talked , and I finally got him around to telling me about his grafting technique . The Jimson-weed plant he had used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . He made the graft at the first fork of a secondary branch , snipping off the branch and inserting the sharpened stem of a tomato plant into the pithy center of the stump . Then he fastened the parts together with a clothespin until the union healed . And that was all there was to it . It was simplicity itself . I was really quite impressed , and I told him so . I asked him how he happened to get the idea . kaloid . It is known , however , that hyoscyamine is somewhat more toxic than atropine , and that as little as two milligrams of atropine will produce such symptoms as rapid pulse , dryness of the mouth , pupil dilation and blurred vision . Well , the Mason tomato yielded 4.2 milligrams of stramonium alkaloid per hundred grams of tomato . That worked out to 6.36 milligrams of alkaloid for the whole tomato . In other words , it was very definitely toxic . But the Clayton tomatoes were di f ferent They averaged just 1,9 milligrams per hundred grams of tomato . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't understand this finding . None of us could understand it . Why should Mason 's Jimsonweed tomatoes be twice as toxic as Clayton 's ? Why should there be any difference at all between the two types ? That was one question . And how was it that the Claytons could eat their tomatoes with impunity ? That was another question . The toxic content of the Clayton tomatoes was n't very high , but it was far from negligible . There must surely have been times when Clayton and his wife each ate a whole tomato , and three milligrams of hyoscyamine is quite enough to cause trouble . " I think I can say that we found the answer to one of those questions . I can also say , I think , that I helped to find it , although I certainly did n't realize it at the time . I picked up a piece of information , but I did n't know what it meant . It had to do with grafting . A few days after the laboratory report came in , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his farm . Both he and Mrs. Smart were home by then and fully recovered , and he took me out and showed me his Jimson-weed tomato plant . It was quite a sight  --  a tomato plant growing out of a big , bushy Jimson weed . I even took some pictures of it . On the way home , I dropped in on Clayton . I introduced myself and told him of my interest in the case , and we discussed it for a while . Then he showed me his Jimson-weed tomato patch . It did n't look much like Mason 's . It seemed to be all tomato plants . They were growing out of Jimson-weed stock , but the Jimson-weed branches were practically bare . Only the tomato plants were lush and leafy . I spoke to Clayton about that , and told him how Mason 's plants looked . Clayton shrugged . This was the way he did it , he said . He liked to keep the Jimson weed pretty well pruned of leaves in order to concentrate the growth in the tomato plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same procedure . " I thought that was an interesting point . As I say , I did n't know what it meant . I did n't know if it had any significance at all . But I passed the information on to Dan Jones at the State Health Department in Nashville . He was handling the case at that end , and he was as fascinated , and as puzzled , by it as I was . And that was as far as my contribution went . Dr. Jones took it from there . I understand he read everything he could find on Jimson weed in the hope of making some sense out of the case . Finally , he wrote to an expert on Datura strarnoniurn  --  a professor of botany at Columbia University named Ray F. Dawson . Dr. Jones and I had both been under the impression that the alkaloid in Jimson weed was produced only in the roots of the plant and then distributed to the stem , the leaves , and the fruit . Dr. Dawson straightened us out on that . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones , Clayton 's pruning trick made a considerable difference . Hyoscyamine is synthesized also in the leaves of a Jimson-weed plant . So Mason could hardly have grown a more toxic tomato if that had been his aim . " The other question is still unanswered . We do n't know how Clayton could have eaten his tomatoes with impunity , and I doubt if we ever will . There are certain facts that may have some bearing on the matter . Different Jimson-weed plants produce different amounts of stramonium alkaloid . It depends on where and how they grow . And people differ somewhat in their sensitivity to the alkaloid . But that kind of clue does n't take us very far . I 'm afraid it does n't take us anywhere at all . "
