Strawberries of such quality are not something one expects to find late in August , when the only ones left in our markets are usually cottony-tasting fruit from California , bred for long-distance travel and not much else . But Mr. Posner , who is a student of pomology at Cornell ' s School of Agriculture and Life Sciences , says he will have his berries from now until the first frost. // The strawberries , which are of a type called " day neutral , " were developed at the United States Department of Agriculture ' s research facility in Beltsville , Md. , in 1981 . The term day neutral means that , unlike regular strawberries , they do not react to the length of day or the amount of light in the atmosphere . The plants bear flowers and fruit at the same time , and continue to bear from early June through the first frost . It is a labor-intensive crop , according to Mr. Posner , who also sells his fruit from a stand next to the clock tower on the Cornell campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must be sprayed with the proper controls . At the Cornell greenhouses , he said , workers continue to develop the strawberries , with the hope that the New York State crop may eventually be able to compete with California ' s. // The 25-year-old Mr. Posner , who is originally from Brooklyn , smiled when asked how he got to be a farmer . " I don ' t know , " he said , confessing that he ' d been up since 1 : 30 that morning to make the trip to the World Trade Center market . He said he had originally studied landscape architecture but switched to agriculture because , he said : " You can eat what you do . It ' s not like a tree , where you have to wait years .

Based on estimated nationwide prices of last June , the study compared the costs of 20 grams of protein , one-third the recommended daily allowance for a man . That amount is provided by an average three-ounce serving of cooked lean meat , poultry or fish. // Three ounces of beef liver costs just 26 cents , the department found , while three ounces of frozen ocean perch fillet costs , on average , 51 cents . The same quantity of frozen haddock fillets comes to 69 cents , while boneless beef round comes to 97 cents . These prices vary from one part of the country to another . Fresh fish , for instance , may be cheaper on either coast than frozen fillets are in the heart of the country. // Other inexpensive sources of protein , such as peanut butter or eggs , may be as good as or better than cheaper cuts of meat . However , the agriculture department noted , the amount of some other protein sources required to produce 20 grams of protein is well over what most people would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half tablespoons of peanut butter , for instance , or four hot dogs or 10 slices of bacon to provide 20 grams of protein .
