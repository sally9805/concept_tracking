It was no more than a year and half ago that the media first set aside the issue of sensitivity and began to fret about the danger of wimpiness . I recall my own first encounter with the problem , when a radio talk show host asked me , in the solemn tones of a newscaster covering an epidemic of wasting disease , " Why are American men turning into wimps ? " Since the show emanated from somewhere like Bozeman , Mont. , rather than Los Angeles , I knew he must be referring to a trend that was already well under way . Indeed , in the weeks that followed I came across dozens of media references to wimps - as disappointing dates , ineffective politicians , health-spa wallflowers - in effect , white-collar trash. // // // All this commentary offered the same explanation for the threatened erosion of American masculinity : American men , once cut from the same mold as Clint Eastwood , had been trying to redo themselves to meet feminist demands for a new , more sensitive and caring male . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become so sensitive and obliging that now not even women could stand their company . A female columnist in one of the high-priced men ' s magazines claimed to long for the crude attentions of a man like L.B.J. A therapist in California announced a new program to help overly softened males get back in touch with their " primal maleness , " as if it were a little animal suffocating in men ' s chests . Male friends who had once taken me aside to inquire anxiously whether they might have been sexists now wanted to know whether I thought they were sissies . As history would have it the 1984 Presidential race coincided with a peak of antiwimp hysteria . We all recall the spectacle of the male candidates variously cussing , arm-wrestling and boasting about their ability to lick all comers in the foreign policy arena . In fact , it was fortunate for all of us that the race ended when it did , before any of them resorted to cruder , though possibly more objective , measures of manhood. // It took me a while to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughhousing . Of course there have been no more " wimps " - or genuinely nice , sensitive men for that matter - in the last couple of years than in the years before . There has been no sudden decline in the incidents of rape or wife-battering , and no documented increase in male participation in housework . All that is happening is that our collective values are shifting away from the liberal , unisex ideals of the 70 ' s toward something more belligerent . The national wimp hunt , I have concluded , is an attempt to press men into line for the post-detente militarism of the 80 ' s - just as the Salem witch hunt was , among other things , a powerful object lesson in why girls should be good. // The truth is , I had never warmed to the more fatuous and self-indulgent products of " men ' s liberation , " if the men ' s liberationists are indeed the prototypical wimps . Like many other women I could not understand why every man who changed a diaper has felt impelled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor is it clear to me why a man should want to get in touch with his feminine side if that means being able to cry : far better , I should think , to have nothing to cry about . Men ' s support groups and conferences also made me uneasy : a careful study of the great religious and military hierarchies would show , I am sure , that men alone , whatever their stated ideals , are in bad company. // But perhaps I am too intolerant . Suppose , say , white Southerners , when first faced with the civil rights movement 30 years ago , had begun to organize consciousness-raising groups and white-lib conferences in order to help themselves cope graciously with change . Imagine their holding workshops on " getting in touch with your Afro-American side , " writing long confessional articles on what it is like to sit in the back of a bus ( or , for that matter , to have to use a bus at all ) , undergoing group therapy to eradicate that deep , subconscious expectation that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brigand or a Jehovah ' s Witness , and so forth . Surely blacks would have been thoroughly disgusted , and rightly so . But would we still be arguing about basics like affirmative action today ? Probably not. // The real problem with men ' s liberation is that it never went far enough : a few men ' s conferences , a dozen or so books on male angst , a few good cries and hugs all around - and then all the good intentions of the 70 ' s seem to have gone into a slow fade . The counterparts of the young middle-class men who once struggled against their sexism and racism - however pompously and noisily - are now straining against the weights in Nautilus machines . Overcoming the ancient grip of sex roles is somehow less urgent to men who can cook their own gourmet meals and who will probably not bother to marry until they find a woman they can effectively " network " with . The only real residue of men ' s liberation may be that it is finally possible for men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress and dine in a fashion that the grizzled old cowboy would have found indecently effete. // // // Yet surely there is plenty more for the men ' s liberationists to work on . Women , for example , are still waiting for the mass arrival of a new man : someone who can perform a simple , menial household chore and manage to keep his mouth shut about it . Someone who will not define ambition , when it occurs in a woman , as " aggression . " Someone who has the inner resources to realize - despite what the men ' s magazines tell him these days - that he is more than just a pretty face and a nice set of pectorals . Someone with tough enough convictions to be able to cross over to the liberal side of a gender gap now and then . If men were to remold themselves along these lines , the gratitude of women would be touching to behold. // With equal urgency , though , men should be rising up in their own self-interest to combat the antiwimp backlash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be outraged by this latest attempt to hector him back to paleolithic styles of masculinity - and he shouldn ' t need a feminist to tell him so . Real men , in my judgment , may eat quiche and wear cologne , but they won ' t stand for wimp-baiting. // //
