William Gaddis is the author of The Recognitions , a massive 30-year-old novel noted for its high style and erudite handling of religion and art . The book has been compared with Joyce 's Ulysses and Gide 's The Counterfeiters and credited with inspiring Thomas Pynchon 's V. Yet as the novel 's reputation grew , its author seemed to vanish . For 20 years Gaddis taught , lived on grants and wrote literature for business and industry : annual reports , speeches for executives , memorandums . In 1975 he reappeared with JR , a lengthy , knowledgeable satire about an eleven-year-old boy who becomes a corporate tycoon . JR won that year 's National Book Award for Fiction , and Gaddis went back to doing whatever it is literary comets do on their elliptical journeys between publication dates . <P> One thing he did was teach a college course on the theme of failure in the American novel . Not so coincidentally , Carpenter 's Gothic is about losers in a competitive society . Gaddis reveals his characters in snatches of dialogue : "  --  Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're taking you to court here , anybody comes to the door do n't open it . Stumpp serving a summons on you some seedy process server comes to the door tell them a mile away , some down at the heels hopeless looking bastard they get seven dollars a summons he has to hand it to you , has to touch you with it , see some burnt out case out here on the doorstep you open it and all he says is Mrs Booth ? hits you with the paper and that 's it , do n't open the door . " <P> The words belong to Paul Booth , a former Army officer fragged by one of his own men in Viet Nam . He is mean-spirited and abusive . His wife Liz is an asthmatic heiress whose money is tied up in a complex trust fund . She is also the captive audience of a talky geologist named McCandless , who has rented his house to the Booths . <P> The eavesdropping reader gets an earful of the couple 's private life . There is much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is something about injuries that Liz suffered in a plane crash and oblique details about an international business deal with geopolitical implications . Booth is in public relations . His clients include the Rev. Elton Ude , founder of the Wayne Fickert Bible College and leader of an evangelical movement in Africa , and a mining company interested in mineral deposits in the area where Ude is harvesting souls . A U.S. Senator is also involved , as is McCandless , who prepared the original geological reports of the site . <P> The action of the novel is restricted to the McCandless house , located in a Hudson River town not far from New York City . The design of the residence is carpenter 's gothic , " a patchwork of conceits , borrowings , deceptions ... a hodgepodge of good intentions like one last ridiculous effort at something worth doing even on this small a scale . " This description is a key to Gaddis ' own architecture : a self-conscious scaling down of his earlier books , in which issues of decline and fraudulence were elaborately developed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
