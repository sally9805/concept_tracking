In this way , the doctors , engineers and technicians on the research team caring for the 61-year-old retired dentist at the University of Utah Medical Center receive the information they need to set the dials to regulate his heartbeat. // Someday , when Dr. Clark is up and about more , he may monitor the screen and adjust the dials himself before he goes to sleep or for a walk , according to Dr. Robert K. Jarvik , 36 , a surgeon and the biomechanic who developed the artificial heart that is keeping Dr. Clark alive. // Adjustments of the heartbeat will not be needed for sudden stresses and brief emotional reactions such as a scare that often make a human heartbeat race . The body can accommodate stresses , as long as they are relatively brief , without any intentional adjustment of the machinery. // However , if Dr. Clark increases physical activity for any extended period of time , if he takes a long walk , for example , then the Jarvik-7 heart may need to be adjusted to pump more blood , and Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The system by which he will be able to monitor his needs was developed by Steve Nielsen , an engineer on the team . He and Larry Hastings , a technician , are at Dr. Clark ' s bedside , monitoring the readouts. // At last report , the monitor showed that each minute Dr. Clark ' s heart was beating 95 times and pumping a total of eight liters of blood through his body , a measure known as the cardiac output. // Those rates have been kept steady in recent days , as the heart team believes it has found the correct setting for Dr. Clark ' s current activity , which varies from long hours of rest to short periods of very mild exercise. // During a typical recent day , the cardiac output varied about two liters . When Dr. Clark slept or rested , it went down about one liter . When he got physical therapy or moved from his bed to a chair , it went up about one liter. // But at all times , the Jarvik-7 heart pumped at a steady rate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drastically every few seconds as the organ responds to a variety of internal stimuli. // As the natural heart rate changes , so does the amount of blood that is pumped through the body . At first thought , it might appear that the amount of blood that flows back to the heart must be equal to the amount that the organ pumps out . But the body ' s physiology is more complex . The fluid carried in the blood can move to muscles and stay there or elsewhere in what are known as the physiological compartments of the body . Also , the kidneys regulate the amount of body fluid by producing more or less urine. // The circulatory system and the rest of the organs are dynamic . By changing their activity from moment to moment , the organ systems keep the body in a steady state , what doctors call homeostasis or a balanced internal milieu. // In the case of the heart , there are various stimuli that regulate it , including nervous system impulses , hormones , the muscular tone of the blood vessels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s law of the heart. // The law is named for Dr. Ernest H. Starling , a British physiologist who said , " The energy of contraction is proportional to the initial length of the cardiac muscle fiber. " // In other words , the heart muscle is capable of contracting more vigorously after it has been stretched . Thus , when more blood flows into the heart , the larger volume stretches the muscle fibers . The organ pumps harder and increases the cardiac output. // The Jarvik-7 heart is made of plastic , not muscle cells . Yet , with the help of the monitoring devices and timely adjustments , the artificial heart can behave like the natural heart and perform somewhat according to Starling ' s law. // This is accomplished by manually adjusting both the pressure and flow of the compressed air powering the Jarvik-7 as well as the time it takes to eject the blood with each beat // There is more than one way to regulate the Jarvik-7 . But the medical team has settled on regulating the heartbeat to as low a rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum amount of blood Dr. Clark ' s artificial heart can pump with each beat , a measure called the stroke volume , is 95 cubic centimeters . The team has set the heart rate so that it pumps a full stroke volume on one beat in five . On the four other beats , it pumps less - about 75 to 80 cubic centimeters of blood . In this way , the artificial heart is allowed to operate at less-than-maximum , safe capacity. // When Dr. Clark rests , there is little variation in his cardiac output . It goes up a little when he exercises because the body requires more oxygen delivery from its blood and in answer to that need more blood is released from tissues , flowing back to the mechanical heart . The heart is then pumping more nearly up to its full capacity with each beat // " Now , if Dr. Clark increases his need , increases his cardiac output , " Dr. Jarvik said in an interview , " we can get to a situation in which he is pumping a full stroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the monitor , we will turn up the heart rate. " // The objective , evidently , is to maintain an adequate flow of blood without overtaxing each stroke of the heart . That happened the other day when the heart was set to beat 90 times a minute . " We turned it up to 95 and that showed us that it was still not reaching the maximum that the heart is capable of pumping , which meant that the heart still had some automatic reserve in it , " Dr. Jarvik said. // Dr. Clark ' s heart monitor plots the average of every 10 beats during the course of an hour . Dr. Jarvik predicted that eventually " very little manual adjustment should be needed " with Dr. Clark ' s artificial heart but that he possibly would need to turn it down when he went to sleep and turn it up when he did his daily chores. // " Or we may find the middle ground where it does not need to be changed , " Dr. Jarvik said . " It depends on what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself to adjust to the artificial heart . Many people have recovered from congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy - the conditions that forced Dr. Clark into this experiment - after their natural hearts healed . However , in those cases the damage to the heart was much milder than in Dr. Clark ' s case . Because the damage stopped , these hearts were much less scarred than Dr. Clark ' s , and the body readjusted as the natural heart healed over several months. // In Dr. Clark ' s case , the implantation of the artificial heart was a sudden event . Although some people have recovered from similar illnesses after heart transplants , Dr. Clark is the first human to receive a permanent artificial heart. // None of Dr. Clark ' s doctors are quite sure how many of the billions of cells in his body will come back to full strength now that he is getting a richer blood supply than he has had in the last several years . Nor do they know how long it will take if the cells recondition themselves. // Those factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clark ' s heart . The Jarvik-7 heart has been implanted into many calves , sheep and goats . If Dr. Clark ' s body responds the way the experimental animals did , then his cardiac output will slowly drop , to perhaps six liters , as his needs after the stresses of surgery decrease . At that level , he might be expected to be able to do a moderate amount of exercise. // The drop in the cardiac output in the weeks after the heart was implanted , beyond the relief from the stresses of surgery , reflects the effects of hormones called catecholamines , as well as " stress and who knows what else , " Dr. Jarvik said. // Because Dr. Clark ' s artificial heart can not respond to nervous system impulses and hormones as the natural heart does , the changes are regulated largely through other tissues in the body. // When Dr. Clark ' s doctors analyze the volumes of data they have collected , they may begin to gain a better understanding of some of those physiological mechanisms. // However , what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that " the artificial heart is responding to the patient rather than the patient responding to the artificial heart.
