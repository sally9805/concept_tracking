Duran quits in the eighth , and Leonard regains his crown <P> For nearly a decade there has been no figure in boxing as fearsome as Roberto Duran , the Panamanian primitive with the famous " hands of stone . " It was not merely his daunting record : 72 victories during a 13-year career ( 55 by knockouts ) , a single loss , championships in both lightweight and welterweight divisions . It was how Duran fought : with a burning-eyed fury that was atavistic , nihilistic , merciless in his rage to win . When he defeated Sugar Ray Leonard last June to strip the Olympic hero of his welterweight crown , Duran at last won recognition as not only the fiercest but perhaps also the finest fighter of his time . <P> So it came as a stunning surprise to the approximately 25,000 fans in New Orleans ' Superdome-and especially to Leonard-when Duran simply quit fighting 2 min. 44 sec. into the eighth round of their 15-round match . Duran first waved a dismissive fist at Leonard , then turned away . Leonard , thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneered at him in contempt throughout the early rounds , closed in with a flurry of punches . Duran turned his back to the blows . Referee Octavio Meyron separated the fighters , then waved them in to fight again . Once more , Duran turned away . " Fight ! " Meyron ordered . Duran finally shook his head : " No ms ! No more ! No more box . " Leonard looked on in disbelief for a long moment , then vaulted across the ring and leaped up on the ropes , hands high in triumph . The World Boxing Council welterweight crown was his once again . <P> What made Roberto pack it in ? One explanation is that he knew he was losing-he trailed on all three judges ' scorecards-and he let his anger and shame get the best of him . After the fight , Duran offered another reason : he had got stomach cramps during the fifth round , and as the fight wore on the cramps spread into his upper body . " I felt I was weakening , " Duran said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anybody . It is an accident . Leonard also was weakening , but I could not pressure him . " <P> Duran 's burning intensity seemed to wane as the match progressed . Leonard , who had wasted his superior speed during their bout last summer by electing to slug toe-to-toe with Duran , wheeled around the ring in high gear this time , sticking the Panamanian with flicking left jabs and evading his head-on charges . By the seventh round , Leonard was so in control of the fight that he turned the tables on Duran and became the taunter . He windmilled his left arm until Duran was mesmerized , then tagged him with his right-a classic sucker punch . Leonard dropped his arms and leaned forward to stick his face out , daring the hardest slugger in the game to hit him . Duran tried , but too many of his punches fell short . Said Leonard : " I saw him slowing down . I noticed his pace change . I looked in his face and I saw the change . The sneer was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornerman , was stunned when his man quit . " I have never seen him throw up his hands and stop , " Arcel said . " I almost fainted when I saw it . I do n't even have a vocabulary to express my amazement . "
