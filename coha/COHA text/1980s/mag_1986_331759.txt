More than two years have passed since a movie of hers was released , but Debra Winger has had no trouble staying in the public eye . The Ohio-born actress made national headlines when she moved into the mansion with Nebraska Governor Bob Kerrey , 42 , whom she had met while making Terms of Endearment . Last week she was in the news again , after marrying Actor Timothy Hutton , to the surprise of almost everyone except , of course , Hutton , plus 25 relatives and close friends who attended the Jewish ceremony at Big Sur , Calif. , overlooking the Pacific . Though Winger , 30 , and Hutton , 25 , had known each other for a couple of years , things got serious four or five months ago . The day after the wedding , the two flew to Charleston , S.C. , where Hutton is beginning a new film , appropriately called Made in Heaven . Winger has also resumed work : she has just completed Legal Eagles with Robert Redford in New York City .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
