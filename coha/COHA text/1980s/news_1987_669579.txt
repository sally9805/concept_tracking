' ' Pershing ' ' and ' ' Broom ' ' are two 17-year-old Polish punk rockers . One cuts her brown hair to resemble a broom . The other , a black-haired girl dressed in a black-leather outfit , does wild dances that her friends say resemble a nuclear missile ready to explode. // // Along with a thousand more Polish teen-agers , the two punks are rocking to the screams of a hard-rock group Siekera at the government-operated Remont Riviera club. // In an eerie echo of America in the 1960s , rock-and-roll is rolling across Eastern Europe , shaking up societies that once prided themselves on the behavior of their young . Polls show that many Eastern European youngsters , such as ' ' Pershing ' ' and ' ' Broom , ' ' are frustrated with school , and jobs , and are fearful of their future . Like their Western counterparts 20 years ago , East European youth are making rock and roll the creed of their generation. // The music presents East European communists with a dilemma . After long years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places such as the Remont Riviera - while worrying whether they can keep the music , and the problems it illustrates to them , within acceptable bounds. // ' ' When I was in Munich and Budapest recently , I visited pop clubs , ' ' says Michal Szymanczak of the Polish Institute of Youth Problems . ' ' In Munich , there were no punks and the music was mellow . In Budapest , the club was filled with punks and the music was alienated and aggressive. ' ' // The Soviet Union is also affected . A film playing to packed houses in Moscow , called ' ' Is it Easy to be Young ? , ' ' profiles young people at a rock concert in Latvia - and finds none of them interested in communism . East European youth organizations confirm this disenchantment with official ideology , reporting declining numbers of young Communist Party members and candidate members. // ' ' Youth here are scared because the economic perspective is bad , ' ' says Gabor Ferencz , a director of the Hungarian Party Youth Union . Waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East bloc countries , forcing youth to live with their parents even after they marry . Says Mr. Ferencz : ' ' The party doesn ' t give convincing answers to these problems. ' ' // Opposition movements do not attract these dissatisfied youngsters , either . In a recent study , researcher Szymanczak divided Polish youth into three categories , pro-party , antiparty , and undecided . ' ' The pro-party group was bigger than the antiparty group , but the vast majority of youth considered themselves undecided , ' ' he says. // ' ' Pershing ' ' and ' ' Broom ' ' seem typical . When asked to list their heros , they name rock-and-roll singer Buddy Holly . What about Lech Walesa , leader of the banned independent trade union Solidarity ? ' ' Politics are nonsense , ' ' they answer , ' ' all politicians want to do is declare war and make people stupid . ' ' They say they want ' ' a way to escape from the drudgery of our daily lives. ' ' // As in the West , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European teen-agers reject their elders ' sexual mores . According to researchers Kurt Starke and Walter Friedrich , the average East German woman loses her virginity at age 16 and changes partners more often than her mother did . Others turn to alcohol and drugs . In Poland , Szymanczak says , ' ' since 1981 , there has been a big rise in both young alcoholics and drug addicts. ' ' // But music represents the most prevalent and public expression of this rebellious , youthful spirit . Grzegorz Brzozowicr , director of the Remont Riviera Club , says ' ' there ' s been an explosion of rock here in the 1980s . ' ' Popular rock records , he says , sell up to 500 , 000 copies , and the Polish rock group Manaam has sold 1. 5 million records - in a country of about 35 million . Manaam and other groups can fill concert halls of 10 , 000 or more people. // After long years of trying to ban rock , authorities now are trying to use rock to their benefit . Gabor Novai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Dolly Roll , ' ' remembers having to listen to the Beatles on jammed broadcasts of Radio Free Europe . But during the last decade , he says , Hungarian radio began playing abundant selections of the American Top 10 . Former East German leader Walter Ulbricht once labeled Western rock ' ' ape culture ; ' ' now the East German government organizes rock concerts . When the breakdance craze came to East Germany , they even sponsored breakdance contests. // Just as the authorities learned to accept Coca-Cola after regarding it as a corrupting Western influence , says guitarist Novai , ' ' they realized rock-and-roll wasn ' t all bad. ' ' // Regimes less liberal than Hungary ' s had no choice but to accept rock . During the 1980s , the hard-line Czechoslovak government tried to keep the lid on the rock explosion , only to be confronted with the emergence of underground rock groups . Last June , the Prague authorities finally succumbed and organized its first major rock festival. // Promoting such festivals helps keep youth in line . After the 1981 declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says rock received an ' ' official green light . ' ' Censorship on lyrics was eased , concerts were promoted , and official radio played the music. // ' ' The authorities decided , ' ' Brzozowicr says , ' ' that it was better to distract young people with rock than politics. ' ' // Admittedly , conflicts still emerge when this desire to distract young people expands into a desire to control the music . After refusing to perform at a meeting of young communists celebrating ' ' Polish-Soviet friendship , ' ' the Polish group Manaam ' s music was banned from the radio and the group prohibited from performing in public for a year. // ' ' The government wanted to tell us what to do , ' ' says Kora Ostrowska , the group ' s lead singer , ' ' but we won ' t put up with any propaganda. ' ' // Musicians who sing overtly anti-communist songs may suffer even worse punishments . Two members of the East German band Rennft Combo were jailed after singing a song criticizing their country ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group Public Enemy went to prison for singing ' ' Russian Nukes are no Nukes ; They are here to caress you. ' ' // Just last week , the leaders of Czechoslovakia ' s celebrated Jazz Section , an independent cultural organization , were sentenced to prison terms . The Jazz Section ' s activities included publishing articles which , while not overtly political , were a channel for intellectual opinion. // ' ' If they had stuck to music , they would have no problems , ' ' insisted a Czechoslovak official . ' ' But they insisted on involving themselves in politics. ' ' // At the Remont Club , these nuances matter little . The tone of the music gets more somber and bitter , the rhythm ever more insistent , the imagery ever more apocalyptic . ' ' War , war is coming , ' ' runs one lyric . ' ' Love , love - it ' s like blood. ' ' // Backstage , lead singer Tomasz Adamski collects his thoughts . Yes , Western music influenced him , hard-rock groups such as Deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble with the censors , not for the political content of his music , but because they considered it ' ' obscene . ' ' For him , music ' ' must be aggressive . ' ' That ' s why he named his group Siekiera - which means ' ' axe. ' ' // ' ' Broom ' ' and ' ' Pershing ' ' approve . ' ' We want to feel the music , ' ' they say . Both criticize some contemporary American popular music as too ' ' sweet. ' ' // Polish rock , they say , is tougher . ' ' It has to be , because our lives here are tougher. ' ' // //
