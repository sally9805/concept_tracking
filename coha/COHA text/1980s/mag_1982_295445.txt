Is Brezhnev ill or on holiday ? <P> <P> Ever since reports circulated late last month that Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev had been hospitalized following a four-day trip to Tashkent , rumors have been rife that he was gravely ill and possibly dying . Soviet officials maintained , however , that Brezhnev , 75 , who has a history of cardiovascular ailments , was simply taking his annual April vacation and resting at his country home outside of Moscow . As of last week Brezhnev had made no public appearances for three weeks , but there were signs that he was carrying on at least some of his official duties . <P> In an interview with Pravda , the Communist Party newspaper , Brezhnev rejected President Reagan 's proposal , made earlier this month , that the two leaders meet informally in New York this June after the disarmament talks at the United Nations General Assembly . Instead , the Soviet President proposed a " well-prepared " summit meeting with Reagan at a neutral site , such as Switzerland or Finland , some time next fall .
