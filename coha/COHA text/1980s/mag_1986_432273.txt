l ' ( 11 ' E . AR SCIENCE CAR TEST # ? Oi Total cars tested to date : 740  | F rom our first day with the Ford Taurus LX , we knew it was an attention getter . Wherever we parked , someone was always admiring it when we returned . And wherever our testers drove it , they were constantly asked , How do you like it ? Is Taurus more than a pretty face ? To find out , we pitted it against a trio of its competitors : Chevrolet Celebrity Eurosport , Dodge Lancer ES , and Audi 5000S . We selected the Audi because many consider it to be a bench mark for high-performance sedans . But our test revealed no performance area in which the Audi was clearly superior . In fact , the performance gap between European and domestic sedans appears to be shrinking , if not disappearing altogether . When we had finished our tests , we came to a split decision over which car was the champion of this group . Surprisingly , the choice was between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ample room for four large adults , Taurus performs well . In our acceleration test , the three-liter V6 and four-speed automatic transaxle powered the sedan to 60 mph in an impressive 11.8 seconds . And at highway speed , the car reflected Ford 's experience building twoton prairie cruisers by whispering along at a quiet 66 dBA as measured on our sound meter . The Taurus also did well in our handling and maneuverability tests , even though it was equipped with Firestone Supreme all-season radials that were never intended to provide ultimate traction on dry pavement . High-speed passes through the handling test were marked by prodigious amounts of fourwheel drift . During several passes the back end swung wide , requiring quick chops of the steering wheel to regain control . The soft springs allow a fair amount of body roll , but the independent front and rear suspensions ( see sidebar ) keep the tires planted firmly on the pavement , even when cornering on rough roads . And in spite of the soft ride , the Ford did n't float or wallow like many domestic sedans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our first stop from 60 mph with cold brakes was an unimpressive 175 feet . And during the 10 stops from 60 mph that we use to warm the brakes before our hot-braking test , pedal pressure rose and the front brake pads started to smoke . The final hot stop was 180 feet , indicating that the brakes did retain what stopping power they had . Still , we expected better braking from a newly designed car . We asked Ford about the brakes . " We have been getting stopping distances of around a hundred forty-eight feet for the Taurus sedan , " said a Ford brake-development engineer . " I would say that the linings could still have been green not broken in . " Brake smoke is usually the burning off of volatile compounds in new brake pads , he said . When this hap-  | pens , the gases keep the pads from firmly contacting the discs , and stopping distances are longer than normal . Our test car had a little over 1,000 miles on it . " You can have a car that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linings , " he said . " Also , the new non-asbestos brake linings take a little bit longer to wear in , though they will also last longer . " In the near future , PS will test a Sable station wagon , which uses the same front brakes as the Taurus . We will make certain that the brake pads are well broken-in , and will report what we find . In day-to-day use the Taurus received only three minor complaints from our testers . The rear suspension rumbles like distant thunder , especially over rough surfaces . The cruise-@# control switches on the steering hub are impossible to see at night . And rain water drips onto the seats ( and passengers ) when the doors ? cut high into the roof ? are opened . Overall , we were impressed with the way Taurus combines a European flair with traditional family-car virtues One thing PS ca n't measure , however . is the car 's long-term reliability . The engine , transmission , chassis , and body structure of Taurus are all new . and clean-sheet cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car test had been a beauty contest , the Chevrolet Celebrity Eurosport would n't even have been a finalist . But its responsive engine , precise suspension , sticky tires , and powerful brakes helped make the boxy sedan the best performer in our group . During our acceleration runs , the 2.8-liter V6 averaged 10.6 seconds from zero to 60 mph . Throttle response was rattlesnake quick , and the fourspeed automatic transaxle shifted through the gears with quiet precision . Handling was also quick and responsive , thanks to the stiff suspension and Goodyear Eagle GT tires that are part of the Eurosport package . Note , however , that the tires on our test car had about half their full tread @#  | depth . When we received it , the Celebrity had 4,700 hard test miles on it , and the tires were well worn . Even on new tires , the Chevy probably would have been the handling champ . But the quick response provided by the short , stiff tread blocks of the worn Eagle GTs no doubt improved the numbers . In the brake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 60 mph . With the brakes hot , stopping distance was almost identical ( 161 feet ) , and fade was minimal . Performance has its price , and in the case of Celebrity the price is its three-box shape and dated interior . Outside , the car is simple and utilitarian . Inside , it looks more like a taxi cab than a European-style sports sedan . And the seat cushions are too flat to hold the driver in place , a serious drawback for a vehicle that generates such high cornering forces . If the Celebrity was the hot rod of the group , we expected the Audi 5000S to reflect European sophistication . Indeed , the 5000S did have that elusive German feel . But our tests revealed the 5000S to be only an average performer . The Audi 's 2.2-liter five-cylinder engine was the smallest of the group , but it hauled the 5000S from zero to 60 mph in 11.8 seconds . And except for a little vibration at idle , the Audi engine was easily as refined as the larger Chevy and Ford V6s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair , but the brakes performed equally well cold and hot , and pedal pressure stayed low . The Audi was also the slowest through our handling and maneuverability tests , although it still earned an excellent rating in both tests . The Audi interior looks Spartan compared with those of its domestic competitors . The controls are easy to use , the seats are supportive , and the driver can see the four analog gauges without peering around the rim of the steering wheel . The blue-andgray striped upholstery of our test car @#  | looked and felt as good as a $500 suit . The fourth car in our group , the Dodge Lancer ES , was far slower than the others . For 1986 , Chrysler offers a 2.5-liter four-cylinder equipped with single-point fuel injection and twin balance shafts . But with its modest 100 horsepower , our test car simply could n't stay with the pack . During hard acceleration , the engine sounded strained , and the shifting of the threespeed automatic transmission was harsh and noisy . Once at cruising speed , however , everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quietest car in our group ( 65 dBA ) . Like the Celebrity , the Lancer was fitted with Eagle GTs , and it waltzed through our handling and maneuverability tests with excellent scores . Cold and hot braking were about average . The interior of the Lancer seems dated , though not as much as that of the Celebrity . The instruments and controls are well placed , but , as in the Chevy , there is an impression of cheapness . The carpeting in the Lancer looks thin , the door panels flex when @# the power windows operate , and the shift lever clunks in its gate . In our group , the Celebrity emerged as the performance champ . But we can assure all those curious onlookers that the Taurus provides a satisfying mix of European and American virtues at a competitive price . Testers ' choices Each of the cars in our group had its own personality . Of the four , I found the Lancer the least appealing . The car needs a V6 . The 2.5 is just not powerful enough , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude for comparison with the two V6s and the Audi five . As for the Audi , its price tag is its greatest liability . With a non-turbo engine , automatic transmission , and all-season tires , it is only an average performer . Yes , it does have that wonderful European feel . But $5,000 worth ? The Celebrity reminded me a bit of a police car ? lots of power , stiff suspension , and plain-Jane trimmings . But if you want performance at a modest price , Celebrity is the choice . Ford has raised the standard for four-door sedans with Taurus . It 's attractive , reasonably fast , handles well , and is comfortable . The possibility of first-year teething problems gives me pause , and I wish the brakes had shown a bit more bite . But for day-today driving , I 'll take Taurus. ? T. W. The automotive equivalent of Clark Kent 's glasses and street clothes , this Chevy 's three-box shape and harvest gold paint hide a terrific performer . Celebrity was best in acceleration , braking , and handling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this vehicle . Ford Taurus lacks the refinement that only time will bring . It is , however , an incredible achievement for Ford in styling , design , and engineering . It appears that Audi has some respectable competition from the American marketplace . The Audi cabin remains a standard of considerate ergonomics and tasteful , purposeful interiors . My prescription for 5000S owners who want better braking and handling is a wider , stickier tire . Nobody wanted to drive the Dodge Lancer home from the test site . I 'm not sure why . Was it the lack of power , the cheapness of the interior materials , or the mechanical noises from the drive train ? The objective numbers Lancer provided in our tests were respectable , but I do n't remember other Lancers I have driven being this rough-edged . Our test car did n't seem representative of the Chrysler H-body family , or of the 2.5-liter four .
