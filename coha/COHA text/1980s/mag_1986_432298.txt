 | The U.S. is now waging the most farreaching war in history against an ever more crafty underworld that is finding new ways to prey on the public . The struggle pits the resources of government at every level against the wily La Cosa Nostra ? " this thing of ours " ? and dozens of other criminal groups that siphon billions of dollars from the legal economy each year . Never before has law enforcement scored such success against what President Reagan calls " an invisible , lawless empire . " Armed with powerful laws and wider use of electronic eavesdropping , the federal government has obtained more than 4,190 organizedcrime indictments in the past year alone . Leaders of four major Mafia " families " in New York are charged with participation in a " commission " that oversees underworld activities nationwide . The heads of 16 of the nation 's 24 Mafia families have been indicted in the past three years . Says President Reagan : " I think that for the first time in our history we finally have the mob on the run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dry up their profits and put their members behind bars where they belong . " Yet law-enforcement officials concede that it is far too early to declare victory over a well entrenched foe . The best and brightest of America 's criminals are as elusive as ever , moving into new enterprises when old operations prove too risky . Colombian cocaine smugglers , " outlaw " motorcycle gangs and secret Chinese societies are expanding , sometimes with Mafia support , to meet the public appetite for drugs , betting and stolen goods . And families within the Mafia , which originated centuries ago as a secret Sicilian society , are becoming more sophisticated . A better-educated third generation turns to lawyers and accountants to build upon a foundation of gambling , drug trafficking and labor racketeering . Among the new enterprises are scams affecting millions of Americans , from credit-card fraud to airline-ticket theft . By all accounts , organized crime remains so pervasive and profitable that , if it were a public company , its revenues would top General Motors on the Fortune 500 . The illicit operations employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than $150 billion each year and rob the Treasury of up to $30 billion in lost tax revenue besides . Meanwhile , the public fascination with " gangsters " goes on , whether it be the folklore of the 1920s or the family feuds played out on city streets . The sidewalk assassination of " Big Paul " Castellano in New York before Christmas gained national attention . " The Godfather " and its sequel netted $117 million in the 1970s . The latest media product ? NBC 's " Mafia Princess " ? was seen in 21 million households on January 19 . Yet people also are reminded that the mob in real life is far more deadly than entertaining . An underworld figure fatally wounded a New York detective on January 21 , emptying a pistol into his face . And hit man Vito Arena calmly recalled in testimony the day he killed his partner , mixed the body with concrete in a metal drum and then went to Chinatown " to eat . " Nationwide crackdown Now , the lawless lifestyle of henchmen like Arena is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , additional resources and years of hard work resulted in 3,530 organized-crime convictions and plea bargains in 1985 . In addition to prison sentences and $15 million in fines , the courts seized $387 million worth of assets and contraband , including narcotics . " This , " says William Weld , U.S. attorney in Boston , " is the golden age of law enforcement . " Seventeen regional organized-crime task forces operate in 26 cities along with a dozen new antidrug task forces with 1,000 investigators and 200 prosecutors . The number of Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel directed against organized crime has jumped 19 percent since Reagan took office . The Reagan administration also vows to im- plement the recommendations of the 18-member President 's Commission on Organized Crime , which is expected to issue its report in early March . By far the most powerful weapon in today 's drive has been prosecutors ' mastery of the 16-year-old RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ( RICO ) . The complicated statute , which authorizes prison sentences of up to 20 years and maximum $25,000 fines , is slapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racketeering " such as extortion , murder and stealing union funds . Reagan has cleared the way for more successful prosecutions under RICO by ending limits on court-ordered wiretaps . A total of 733 federal wiretaps were obtained in the first four years of the Reagan Presidency , compared with 326 during the Carter years . With agents listening in on nearly a million conversations a year , mobsters operate in a climate of constant suspicion . The transmitter secretly installed in the dashboard of a Jaguar owned by Salvatore Avellino , Jr. , chauffeur to Anthony " Tony Ducks " Corallo , enabled U.S. prosecutors to document existence of the " commission " and gather evidence of the Lucchese family 's control over garbage collection on Long Island . Scores of undercover agents are just as effective . An Internal Revenue Service agent who pretended to be corrupt is the key witness in the racketeering trial of Carmine Persico , reputed head of the Colombo family in New York . An undercover agent posing as a well-to-do crook aboard a rented yacht got members of the Gambino family to detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law-enforcement authorities also is speeding convictions , with more than  | 100 cooperative efforts under way nationwide . " For years , " says Thomas Sheer , deputy assistant director of the FBI in New York , " we sat across the table , but no one talked . " Now , with FBI agents and 165 New York detectives working side by side , more than 300 underworld figures have been indicted . There 's more cooperation , too , among government agencies . The Internal Revenue Service now can legally share information , enabling it to weigh in with complicated tax cases in almost two thirds of organized-crime prosecutions . In addition , the United States is working closer than ever with Italy ? destination of about $ 1 billion in Mafia heroin revenue each year , according to federal estimates . Cooperation has reached the point where Tommaso Buscetta , highestranking Sicilian informant ever , is being shared with U.S. authorities in New York who are prosecuting mobsters involved in the " Pizza connection , " a scheme in which defendants allegedly used pizza parlors to " launder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity in the U.S. Inside the family The ability of law enforcement to get large numbers of gang members to violate the traditional code of omertdconspiracy of silence ? is responsible for much of the recent success . Fearing lengthy stays in prison where they could be vulnerable to mobordered murders , many underworld figures are joining a witness-protection effort that costs $19 million a year . Each year , some 300 new informants are entering the program , which already has provided new identities , houses and fake biographies to 1,400 informers since 1970 . To date , Angelo Lonardo , 74-yearold underboss of the Cleveland mob , has been the highest-ranking American  | mobster ever to turn informer . Faced with a life sentence plus 103 years , he bargained for his freedom by providing testimony against underworld associates . Progress also is made on breaking the pipeline the mob uses to launder money from illegal businesses ; 19 major money-laundering operations involving $2.8 billion have been broken since 1980 , leading to 460 convictions and seizure of $116 million in currency and property . Federal currency-reporting regulations also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insight in the Bank of America was slapped with a record $4.75 million fine for failing to report more than 17,000 large cash deposits and transfers over a six-year period . The crackdown began last year when the First National Bank of Boston was fined $500,000 for " willfully and knowingly " failing to report $1.2 billion in cash transactions with nine foreign banks . " By closing off avenues for laundering , we force drug dealers to find other ways to get money out of the country , " says Leon Kellner , the U.S. attorney in South Florida , where much of the laundering of drug profits takes place . Kellner recently convicted a drug operator arrested with $5.5 million in cash aboard a Learjet . Authorities said the operation laundered $150 million in drug money in a two-year period by funneling it through Panama . Changing to survive Confronted with such a wide-ranging assault by law enforcement , organized crime is shifting gears . Some high-risk ventures have been left to others , underwriting the rise of powerful new gangs in the South and West . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocaine trade in Florida , with nationwide cocaine trafficking generating an estimated $40 billion a year in street sales . La Cosa Nostra has left some heroin business to less structured operations run by Mexicans , Chinese , Nigerians and Pakistanis . Industrious La Cosa Nostra families , however , are moving into newer fields . Says Arthur F. Nehrbass , a retired FBI agent in Miami and now commander of Dade County 's Organized Crime Bureau : " If you could predict what will be hot in 1986 , LCN will be in it . " Trade in counterfeit stocks pumped millions into Mafia coffers before backroom procedures in brokerage houses were tightened . Now , testimony from mobsters and talks by USN &; WR reporters with law-enforcement officials reveal a new pattern of marketplace scams touching the lives of millions : Credit cards . Bankers estimate that fraud and counterfeiting of consumer credit cards and bank debit cards are generating upward of $750 million a year for organized crime . Airline tickets .

This gives them access to airline computers . Gasoline scam . An estimated $500 million a year in federal , state and local tax revenue is being lost as a result of underworld gasoline bootlegging in Florida , New York and 15 other states . Toxic waste . Mob-controlled garbage-collection companies , principally in New York , New Jersey , Ohio and Florida , are picking up toxic waste from client firms , mixing it with regular garbage and then dumping the deadly material at unregulated sites . Record industry . Mob-controlled firms are producing albums and moving into record-distribution operations . Tax shelters . Organized crime has invaded Appalachia to take legal control of some mines in order to sell unwary investors fraudulent tax shelters in those mines . Seven states , which are cooperating in " Operation Leviticus , " are investigating instances of the mob 's snapping up financially troubled coal ? properties , " cooking the books " and then selling the mines at inflated prices . The old reliables All this is not to say that La Cosa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucrative moneymaker . The gross of some $40 billion a year provides funds that are readily available for loan sharking , racketeering and payoffs to public officials . Hundreds of millions of dollars are derived from mob-run sports gambling conducted coast to coast with public acquiescence , if not support . Nearly all of the nation 's newspapers with circulations over 175,000 run point spreads on pro-football games . A " street tax " on local bookmaking operations generates additional millions . La Cosa Nostra members also " skim " from the more than $3 billion grossed annually by casinos in Nevada . Five men were convicted on January 21 in Kansas City , Mo. , for skimming more than $2 million from Las Vegas casinos . Illicit drugs ? a $110 billion enterprise ? remain a mother lode of underworld profits , which are staggering . A pound of heroin worth $2,300 in Pakistan is bought by an American importer for $110,000 and sold on the street after being diluted for $1.1 million . In a New York case , 22 men now face charges of smuggling $1.7 billion worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , remains the most pernicious enterprise of all , for it enables organized crime to take control of unions , achieve enormous political clout and infiltrate legitimate businesses . Methods have changed little since the rough-and-tumble days of Prohibition when Chicago 's Al Capone gained control of 91 unions and companies by 1928 . Using extortion and threats , operatives take key union positions . Once inside , mobsters have access to some of the $51 billion in union welfare and pension funds . Before the federal government stepped in , the Central States Pension Fund of the Teamsters , with assets of more than $5.3 billion , was making millions of dollars in loans to mob-controlled real estate .  | Eavesdropping on the mob Tapes give inside look at gangster life What 's it like to be part of the underworld ?

We 'll toss the expletive coin .  | Organized crime also arranges spurious union expenses and creates " ghost " jobs to hide funds that are kicked back to the Mafia . Finally , mob-controlled unions use threats of " labor problems " to exact payoffs from legitimate firms . Underworld influence affects some 4,000 of the nation 's 70,000 union locals , often in crucial industries or regions , according to federal investigators . Four of the nation 's most important unions , according to the FBI , are " substantially influenced and/or controlled by organized crime " : The International Longshoremen 's Association with 65,000 members , the Hotel and Restaurant Employes Union with 327,000 , the Laborers International Union of North America with 383,000 , and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , the largest and one of the nation 's most powerful unions , with 1.9 million members ranging from airline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bastion of Mafia operations according to investigators , illustrates the depth of control . The port has deteriorated as a result of corruption on the waterfront . The construction industry now is so thoroughly infiltrated that federal investigators calculate costs are fully 25 percent higher to cover payoffs for commercial and residential construction . Much of the garment industry also is said to be plagued by mob-controlled operations . Corruption of some moving and storage firms is so deep that the New York FBI headquarters unwittingly overpaid to have furniture moved from one office to another because the contract had been rigged by the mob . Garbage collection costs an extra $50 million a year in New York City to cover payoffs . On Long Island , it is up to 400 percent more expensive , say investigators . Mob control is so widespread that law-enforcement officials have been grappling for five years to end it in the air-freight business at Kennedy International Airport where $50 billion worth of cargo is handled each year . The line of succession La Cosa Nostra is showing every sign of laying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Governor Mario Cuomo condemn public references to the Mafia as an insult to the vast majority of Italian Americans who want nothing to do with the mob . Howard Abadinsky , author of Organized Crime , agrees but says that " there is no difficulty in replenishing crime families . " Men like Ken Eto of Chicago continue to sign on to succeed the estimated 60 percent of the nation 's 2,000 " made " Mafia members who are age 50 or older . On-the-job training leads to promotion : " First they recruit you as a muscle man , then breaking legs or arms and then finally murdering people , " says Eto , under federal protection after testifying against associates . Organized crime , say prosecutors , is laying the foundation in even newer fields including resorts , nursing homes , auto dealerships , meatprocessing operations and restaurants . Investigators see operations surfacing in the Ozarks and extending to the sun belt , including New Mexico .

" Their sons are getting degrees from colleges and are coming back with expertise in law , accounting and business , " explains G. Robert Blakey , a Notre Dame law professor who helped pioneer use of the powerful RICO statute . " Their horizons will be necessarily broader . " As many as 30 corrupt lawyers and perhaps an equal number of accountants are serving the " new mob " in New York and Chicago . With their help , offspring of leaders in La Cosa Nostra expand into legitimate businesses as well as continue links with organized crime . Salvatore and Joseph Bonanno , Jr. , sons of a New York mob chief , were indicted in 1981 in California for using a construction company as part of a scheme to defraud elderly homeowners . Salvatore was convicted last year and is awaiting sentence . Joseph has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of Colombo family underboss John Franzese , spent a year at Hofstra University and became a movie producer . All the while , according to a recent federal indictment , he was becoming involved in sophisticated financial scams , including the defrauding of automobile dealerships and companies such as Mazda , Chevrolet and Mobil Oil Corporation . " Instead of walking into a prospective customer with a black shirt and wide tie , they will be walking in with exquisitely tailored suits and speak as if they graduated from Princeton , " says Raymond Dearie , U.S. attorney in Brooklyn . " But their intent is the same . " Yet many of the Americanized youn- ger leaders share few of the deep personal ties forged by their elders in closely knit ethnic neighborhoods of the 1920s . As a result , they are more willing to talk when squeezed by prosecutors . Notes Ronald Goldstock , director of New York State 's organizedcrime task force and a driving power behind widespread use of RICO : " They lack internal discipline and the ability to maintain secrecy and loyalty as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gang families already disrupted by internal fights . The murder of " Big Paul " Castellano in New York was considered to be another chapter in gang warfare that is feared in Kansas City and New England where new leadership has not yet emerged . Turf battles have surfaced , too , with families in Cleveland and Pittsburgh fighting for control of operations in Youngstown , Ohio . Two dozen murders have taken place in Philadelphia . A plan for victory ? Despite the Mafia 's organizational troubles and the inroads law enforcement has made , no one sees an end to the mob 's influence anytime soon . Before victory can be declared , experts outline three major areas that must be addressed : Labor racketeering . With organized crime holding " monopoly power " in some industries , Judge Irving R. Kaufman , the U.S. appeals-court judge heading the President 's crime commission , argues that only " a coherent federal strategy " can eradicate organized crime 's corruption of business institutions and labor organizations . Targeting underworld leaders " is not sufficient , " adds Edwin Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the commission . " We have to give more thought to a strategy for tracing their assets and forfeiting them . " Strong role for the states . To achieve such a coordinated strategy and to offset loss of federal manpower as a result of expected federal budget cuts , states must step up their own efforts to combat organized crime . Twenty-seven states have no equivalent of the RICO statute , and 19 have no laws allowing wiretapping . Public corruption . To cement public confidence and further cramp organized crime , prosecutors must continue the drive that each year nets more than 900 corrupt public officials across the nation , many for offenses involving organized crime . Some are even more brutal than the Mafia Gangs that rival the mob If authorities hope to crush organized crime , their battle plan had better include strategy against dozens of ethnic gangs and " outlaw " motorcycle clubs . Colombian drug operators , Asian racketeers and gangs such as the Hell 's Angels reap hundreds of millions of dollars annually in illegal profits and often are more violent than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " observes Frank Storey , head of the FBI 's organized-crime section . Symbol of a new threat " We want to move in before they get a foothold . " As many as 20 Colombian cocaine " families " ? many based in Florida ? smuggle in 75 percent of the estimated $40 billion worth of cocaine sold in the U.S. each year . They have virtually no ties with the Mafia establishment that , together with Nigerian and Pakistani racketeers , controls much of the heroin traffic . More established are criminal operations conducted by secret Chinese societies linked to Hong Kong and Taiwan . These networks run illegal gambling casinos in the Chinatowns of New York and San Francisco as well as narcoticssmuggling rings that handle an estimated 20 percent of the $53-billion heroin trade . Arrests of 12 members of the United Bamboo gang in September thwarted plans to import 660 pounds of heroin with a value of $6 billion ? money allegedly intended to finance a gang-run Las Vegas casino . Making inroads chiefly in Hawaii and California is the ruthless Japanese Yakuza crime network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter-inch into the skin and sacrifice parts of fingers for transgressions . Profits from drug smuggling , gun running , prostitution and gambling are funneled into purchases of import-export businesses , real estate and nightclubs in the U.S. , as well as tour agencies catering to the Japanese . Three gang members were arrested in Honolulu in September , charged with soliciting an undercover agent to buy a rocket launcher for a murder , as well as trying to smuggle into Hawaii 52 pounds of methamphetamines and 12 pounds of heroin worth $11.8 million . Also on the rise are Vietnamese gangs preying upon the 742,000 refugees who have settled in the U.S. since Saigon 's fall in 1975 . Frogmen , Thunder Tigers and other gangs allegedly steal refugees ' valuables and " collect " funds from Vietnamese populations in California and Texas for the liberation of the homeland . In 1982 , Vietnamese publisher Nguyen Dam Phong of Houston was murdered for trying to expose the racket . Law-enforcement authorities are worried that Asian mobs and motorcycle gangs are forging links with the Mafia . The three-year federal undercover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 11 states last May and established that millions of dollars in drugs were being distributed through " liaisons with other traditional organized-crime families , " an FBI official said . Violent Israeli extortionists are spreading in California . Russian emigres are involved in fencing operations . And prosecutors in New York recently uncovered a " school for scandal " where Nigerians learn how to commit fraud , including faking credit cards . Hong Kongbased gangs also are exporting their members to the U.S. in advance of China 's retaking control of the British Crown Colony in 1997 . The challenge for law enforcement , according to former Atty . Gen. William French Smith , is to move in before these gangs are " so entrenched that they become all but impossible to root out . "  | New York State Supreme Court Justice William C. Brennan now faces up to 20 years in prison for conviction in December on 26 counts of racketeering , attempted extortion , conspiracy and receiving bribes . Prosecutors said in exchange for $50,000 in bribes funneled through a friend , the judge agreed to aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Experts concede that the most difficult challenge may be ending the cozy relationship between public figures ? Presidents included ? and underworld members . Joseph A. Bevilacqua , chief justice of Rhode Island 's Supreme Court , was censured last summer by state authorities for " bringing his office into serious disrepute " by consorting with men identified as members of organized crime . Former Teamsters chief Jimmy Hoffa , whose union supported Richard Nixon in 1968 , won presidential clemency in 1971 on a sentence for jury tampering . Anthony Scotto , a member of the Gambino family and head of the New York Maritime Port Council , campaigned with Jimmy Carter in 1976 . Nicholas Sands , convicted of racketeering in 1975 , served as a key fund-raiser for Democrat Geraldine Ferraro after she was elected to the House in 1978 . Officials from the Reagan administration also have met with leaders of unions allegedly riddled with underworld influence . Teamsters official Jackie Presser lunched with Reagan during the 1980 campaign . Since 1980 , Presser also has met with Edwin Meese , the former presidential counselor now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The impact of such contacts can lead to an erosion of public confidence and dampen the desire to end racketeering . Organized crime is aware of this and purposefully seeks to cultivate and benefit from political influence . " Government officials reject suggestions of impropriety . Observes Meese : " The fact that people did meet with labor leaders was certainly not designed or intended to in any way interfere with the proper investigation of organized crime . " As such controversy suggests , rooting out organized crime remains an Olympian task . It will take a continued flood of convictions and seizures of mob assets to determine whether 1986 marks the " beginning of the end to organized crime , " says Blakey , the Notre Dame law professor who helped give government the RICO statute . For now , he says , " the jury is still out . "
