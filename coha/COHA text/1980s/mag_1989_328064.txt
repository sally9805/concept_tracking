When so-called round-table talks between the Polish regime and the Solidarity-led opposition began last month , few observers expected a quick breakthrough . At issue was the political price the government would pay to win support for economic austerity measures . Last week , to just about everyone 's surprise , the negotiators disclosed that they had agreed on a thorough reorganization of the political system . The reform would include the creation of a senate to complement the existing lower house , or Sejm , with members chosen in free elections , as well as the institution of a powerful presidency , with the officeholder selected by parliament . Said Jacek Kuron , a leader of the banned Solidarity trade union : " This is a step toward democracy , the like of which has never been taken before under this system . " <P> If the accord is carried out , it will mark the first time a Communist government has voluntarily ceded a major share of power to the opposition . Not only would Solidarity and other opposition groups be free to compete for seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberalized elections to the Sejm in which non-Communists could win up to 35% of the 460 seats . The two chambers would then elect the President . Details of the pact will not be unveiled until April 3 , but both sides have already agreed to June parliamentary elections . <P> Still , the Communists are not about to yield their pre-eminent place . The most likely candidate for the post of President is General Wojciech Jaruzelski , First Secretary of the Communist party . Said government negotiator Janusz Reykowski : " Nowhere do elections contest that system . That would threaten the stability of the state . " <P> The pact could still falter on the question of economic reform . Solidarity wants wages to be indexed to the inflation rate , currently 70% , and price increases for food and other necessities to be introduced gradually . Even so , said Solidarity representative Bronislaw Geremek , " after 45 years in a political desert , we suddenly find ourselves in a completely new situation . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
