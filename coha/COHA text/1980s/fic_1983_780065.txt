 | David tapped at the door of Tanya Rolfe 's cottage . There was a sound of - chair scraping against floor , then a voice , " Come in . " The wrinkled face moved in a smile . " Good morning , David . I 've been expecting you to come by to see me . " " But how ? Today is n't my lesson . " " No . " The dark eyes looked at him keenly . " But most of my boys and girls come when they reach this point . Come and sit with me , David . Have a cup of tea . " She took his firm hand in hers , drew him to a chair , and poured strong tea from a thin old china pot . The odor of sassafras and lemon rose from the cup . It seemed to him as he sipped from it that Tanya Rolfe was like her teapot  --  crazed and fragile with age , but filled with good strong stuff that warmed him . " You are sixteen now . Your Final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tomorrow . " " So soon ? " She sighed deeply , her breath running out in reedy tones . " I thought a month , perhaps , or two . So soon . " A veil seemed to come over her eyes for a moment , a fleeting look of vulnerability . He wondered that he 'd missed it before . How had he missed seeing how fragile she 'd become the last few years ? Her hand on the cup was translucent porcelain , patterned with thin blue veins . In dismay , he realized that he 'd not really  | seen her before . He had n't heard the faint rattle of air as it moved in and out of her lungs . Had n't noticed the swelling of instep and ankle above her tiny feet . Had n't seen the effort in her movements . He clenched his fist , feeling nails bite into his palm . She set down the cup and took his hand in hers , opening it , relaxing the curved fingers . " You want to know what will happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He nodded , string at their twined fingers , at her heavy gold ring . " You 're a highly skilled musician , David . You have technique that can improve with time and maturity . You have talent , too . You 're musical . But you have something more . . . . " She paused , looking through the window at something that lay far beyond the scope of her eyes . " It 's something called The Divine Discontent . ' I think of it as a yearning to move outside of myself  --  to be a part of something more , something greater , and yet to still be uniquely Tanya Rolfe . " It 's the discontent of a sapient wave lapping on a beach , shifting the sands , and knowing that when it is gone , another will wipe out all traces of its path . And it feels rage ? " A touch of passion edged her voice . " Rage . " Then she laughed softly . " Some call it the thumbscratch syndrome . " He looked at her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves , our comings and goings change the face of the earth . But it is n't enough . We feel the need to personally scratch the face of eternity  --  deep enough to leave a scar . Proof , you see , that we 've been here . " " And if I 'm always going to be here ? " " Then , there goes your motivation . Immortality is a sure cure for the thumbscratch syndrome . " But if I did ? " " You 'd still be clever , David . And competent . But you 'd be striking a cooling iron . And after a while , it would n't matter to you . " He nodded , stood , walked to the door , then turned . " Has it always happened like that ? Is it for sure ? " " I ca n't say that the spark must go out . But it always has ,  | David . " Her hand , gentle as a moth , touched his shoulder . " It always has . " He moved up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath come in short gasps . Sunlight , filtering the new leaves of May , dappled the spongy forest floor beneath his feet . He sought a high crest , a place where he could overlook Renascence . He wanted to see it all , for once . If he could see it all , maybe he could make it fit together in his mind . He stepped over a rotting tree trunk in his path and froze . Glittering death coiled by his foot . He heard the warning rattle with only part of his brain . Another part observed , actively orchestrating his fear . . . a rattling maraca : a tom-tom mimicking the beat of his heart . Accelerando . Silence . A silence whimpering in his mind at 44o cycles per second  --  increasing to a scream  --  ten thousand cycles , twenty , more . Pulsating beyond the audible range . Felt . If it struck , if its fangs entered a vein , an artery , he was too far from help . His muscles contracted . He sprang , running through the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running with a tom-tom throbbing against his chest , his throat . Had it struck ? Would he feel it , if it had ? Reason told him he was safe ; fear thrust him ahead . His muscles propelled him on . He ran until his body rebelled and withdrew his strength and his breath . He fell in a heap at the foot of a wide oak , leaning his back against it for support . " Coward , " he said aloud to himself when he had breath . " Coward . " But part of him rankled in defense . What else could he do ? He did n't want to die . He did n't want to die . He made his way back down the mountain to the stream by the clearing . A tall reed-thin boy pressed wet clay in spiraling shapes on a flat stone emerging from the shallow water . He looked up . " Ah , David . Been up the mountain ? " It was more than a casual phrase . Sooner or later , nearly everyone made that trek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like food or water , as if the mountain held answers that the valley could n't . David nodded , . " Been up the mountain , M'Kumbe . " " Does the air breathe softer there ? " The tension in the question revealed itself in the long black fingers kneading the slick clay . He did n't know how to answer . The black eyes looked into his , the fingers moved . " I build my own  --  here . " The lump of clay rose against the pressure of the boy 's hands and grew ridged like a naked spine against the rock . " It rises , it falls . I can be a god to this little mountain . But in the end , it 's only clay . " He brought down his fist , smashing the earthen spine . Then he smoothed it into a flat cake , blending it with pale pink palms and long black fingers , bisecting it with a curving " S. " " Up and down . Yin and yang . " The fingers stopped for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked all morning . " He found her in her cabin , sitting on the old tall stool in front of her desk , writing . " A poem ? " he asked . " A letter . To myself . " She wrote a few moments longer , then laid the pen down and looked up . " It 's a thought-straightener . " Three people told me you wanted to talk to me . " " I do . But right now , let 's walk . " She slipped off the stool and picked up a small split oak basket that sat in the corner of the room . The blackberries are out . " She swept out of the cabin and was halfway over the footbridge before he caught up with her . " What 's wrong ? " " Nothing . " She looked at a point just over his head as if she found it of utmost importance . He took her shoulders , turning her toward him . " What 's wrong , Liss ? " She twisted the little basket from side to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just developed a love for blackberries . " Her chin thrust defiantly , but she avoided his eyes . " I like them so well , in fact , that I 've decided I want to eat them forever . " His hands slowly dropped to his sides . He leaned up  | against the railing of the little bridge , trying to think . Of all the people here , Liss had been the most sure . Her lips turned up at the corners , but her eyes did n't match . " There 's an old saying , David : It 's a woman 's prerogative to change her mind . ' Ever heard it ? " He shook his head . A slight crinkle grew around her eyes . " Technician . " And then the old joke , " I 'm going to have to take you in hand . " They began to walk . They walked for quite a while before they came to a rambling patch of blackberry bushes , before he said , " Why , Liss ? " Her hands flew among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basket and her fingers purple . Without answering , she reached for a cluster deep within a bush and. , with a little cry , drew out her hand , empty . A deep scratch curved across the skin , and tiny drops of blood appeared here and there , merging into a red line . She began to cry , all out of proportion to the hurt , shoulders heaving , little snub nose turning red and snuffly . He watched her , feeling utterly helpless . The basket fell to the ground , spilling berries into the grass , and still she cried , curving her hands into fists . And then , between breathless , racking sobs , she said , " Do n't you know anything ? Do n't you know anything ? " He stood accused , not knowing of what . " Technician . " She drew in a huge snuffling breath . " You 're supposed to comfort me . It says so in all the books . " Dismayed , he reached out awkwardly and patted her head , ruffling her soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . It started halfway between a giggle and a gasp . Then it grew to madhouse proportions , until she had to sit down in the warm new grass . It was infectious and he found himself on the ground beside her , laughing too . Hugging her , laughing , then kissing in a heap of scattered blackberries . And it seemed to him then that maybe they were both crazy , but it did n't matter . Tossing their clothes in a purple-stained tangle , they clung together , rolling on the soft warm ground , pressing to- gether with cool flesh and frantic need . Later , laughing , they ran naked down the path to the lake and plunged into the frigid , heart-stopping water . After they dressed , they walked in the sunlight , briskly at first , trying to warm up . They took the high path back along the broad back of a ridge . Below them , they could see the clearing . In the sharp blue sky , a line grew to the shape of a disc . " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's watch . " The hover stopped its forward surge and dropped gently to the floor of the valley . The doors opened , disgorging a cargo of seven children . " Do you remember the day we came , David ? " He nodded , watching the little group . One boy stood apart from the rest , shoulders back , legs slightly apart , looking braver than he could possibly feel . Another looked around with eyes as big as the landscape he tried to take in . They seemed so little . She echoed his thoughts . " Were we ever that small ? " " I suppose we were . " " It must have been harder for you , " she said . " You were plucked out of a dormitory and brought here . I never lived that way  --  there were just me and my parents . I was used to being alone back at home . But , you know , I think you did better than I did . " She sat down , drawing her arms around her knees . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You found out that you did n't . " He felt an eyebrow raise . She laughed , crinkling her nose at him . " Well , " she said coyly , " sometimes you need people . But most of the time you 're buried in that cabin of yours like an ingrown nail in a toe . " " Is that your poetic opinion ? " " It may not be poetic , but it is decidedly my opinion . I do n't think you know half of what goes on here . " " Such as what ? " Her eyes clouded . " Did you know Tanya Rolfe is dying ? " The words caught him like a fist in the stomach . " How do  | you know ? " But he was remembering how frail she 'd looked that morning , remembering the sound of her breath slipping from her lungs . " I had to rewrite her obituary . " The word puzzled him . " Her death notice . It 's an old custom in journalism  --  the writers still observe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obituary in the communicator in case they die suddenly . Hers was out of date . Her new conserere had to be added to it , and several sonatas . " They told me to do it right away . Anyway , you know how I ca n't seem to keep from meddling . . . " She looked up at him . " One question seemed to bring up another , so I coded the communicator for her medical file . " " Is that why you decided to  --  eat blackberries forever ? " She shook her head . " Not really . " She reached her hand up to him . " Help me up . Walk me back to my cabin and I 'll show you . " He reached out a hand to her and pulled her to her feet . They walked down the curving path , not talking , not feeling the need to talk , until they came to the old footbridge that led to Liss 's cabin . " We did n't get any blackberries , did we ? " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll have a long time for that . " " Will you ? " He pushed open the door to the cabin , striding ahead of her . " I do n't know . " She walked to the tall desk and rummaged through a stack of papers , drawing one out . " Read this . " " Your letter to yourself ? " She shook her head . " A poem . " He read , thrumming the cadences with fingers tapping against his knee . " What do you think ? " she asked when he finished . " Be honest . " " I 'm always honest , " he said . " I know you are . That 's why I wanted you to read it . " " But I 'm not a poet . "  | She sank into a chair next to him and stared at the wide planked floor . He looked at her for a moment , then he said , " It seems to be quite good . Technically , you 've done well and your imagery is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You did n't need to . I can see it in your face . " " I told you I 'm not a poet . " " Neither am I. " She took the paper from him and folded it in half , creasing the edges with a thumbnail . " I 'm a little slow . It took me a long time to find out . But , now that I know , there 's no point in drawing it out , is there ? " He considered his words carefully . Then he said , " You have to give yourself time , Liss . We all do . It does n't come all at once . " " I have decided to give myself time . All the time in the world . " " Are you sure ? " " I 've thought about it a lot . I 'm glib . I 'm clever . I have a knack with words . That does n't make me a poet , David . Not even a fledgling poet . It just is n't there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive I have  --  it still would n't be enough . I could write until this cabin fell away to dust " ? she swept her arm toward the window ? " until these mountains crumbled . And it would n't matter . " Her face twisted . " It 's not easy to finally admit to yourself what should have been obvious . " He pulled her to him awkwardly , cradling her head against his shoulder . " What are you going to do now ? " After a few minutes , she sat up . " I have nearly a month to go before my Final Decision , but that wo n't change anything . " She looked at him sharply . " I can still write , you know . Derivative stuff , non-fiction , so on . I suppose I 'll do that . I 'm basically a compiler anyway . I 'm good at it . Not many people are . She stood up , smoothing her clothes . Then she walked to the tiny dispenser , punched a lever , and extracted two containers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relief . I do n't have to prove  | myself anymore . " She handed him one and drank deeply from the other . " I do n't have to do anything , except be . " He fingered the juice container , wondering what to say to her , saying nothing . She sat down beside him . " It 's funny the way things work out , is n't it ? " Her face moved in a wispy little smile . " I never thought it would turn out that I 'd be the technician . " Liss ate with a good appetite , while David rearranged his food , absently pushing it into ridges and furrows , eating none . She chided him . " You 're as thin as a spar , now . If you fall away any more , the ants will carry you off . " His face quirked into a smile , but he could n't eat . After dinner as the evening sun slipped away in purple shadows , they walked to the open concert hall cantilevered over the lake shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked . He shook his head . " She would n't let me see the score . " He was going to hear Tanya Rolfe 's " Summer Conserere " for the first time that night , and he was acutely aware that it was to be her last work . They took seats near the rear . Beyond the stage , the last colors of evening blazed pink above the mountains at the far edge of the lake . " That was planned , you know , " said Liss admiring the sunset . " The visiographer is Lindner . I think he 's a genius . Nobody else can combine nature and artifice the way he can . " The stage rose silently before them , bearing the conductor and the small orchestra . A hush  --  then a measured chorus of cicadas began , answered by the flickering lights of a hundred fireflies . The chorus increased tenfold , as the tiny fireflies became ten thousand points of light wheeling slowly across the darkening sky in constellations of cold fire . A symphosizer sighed once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a theme uttered by a single soloboe . David felt himself swept away by the music and the subtle changing effects in the sky around him . In turn , he felt love ,  | then grief and a heavy sense of loss , then hope . A throbbing of strings and colors began , so delicate he felt it as pain in the tightness of his throat . Then silence . Black . Night , until a single point of light  --  a shooting star  --  grew to a great ball of fire and a swelling chorus of exultation . He felt tears rise in his eyes and blinked to keep them back . He felt vaguely ashamed of them , and yet they were echoed by bright eyes everywhere in the audience . He joined with the others in applause , rubbing his hands together slowly at first , then more briskly . The leathery rustle of appreciation grew in speed and then the ultimate compliment  --  spontaneously , the audience began the rhythmic , sighing breathing that symbolized an inspired performance , that symbolized the breath of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tanya Rolfe . She came onto the stage on the arm of Lindner , the visiographer , walking slowly with a halting step . She stood with her head flung back as if to take in more air . The rhythmic breathing increased in tempo until David 's fingers tingled and he felt quite giddy . Next to him , Liss sighed , fluttering on the edge of consciousness . Here and there , people in the audience toppled , overcome by the hyperventilation . And still it went on , until Tanya Rolfe signaled to Lindner and the two walked slowly off the stage . He left Liss at the path near her cabin . " You want to be alone ? " He nodded . " I understand . " She kissed him lightly and turned away , then stopped , saying , " David , we 've been friends . That 's important , is n't it ? " She looked at him once again . Will you tell a friend  --  when you decide ? " He kissed her then . They clung together like two lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently pushed him away and , without saying goodbye , walked away toward the little footbridge . He wandered alone for a while , not noticing where he was going until he found himself near Tanya Rolfe 's cabin . A light still shone through the window .  | He tapped lightly on the door , got no answer , tapped again . The door was unlocked , and he pushed it open . Still dressed , she lay on the bed . Her eyes were closed . For a shattering moment , he thought she was dead . Then a thin whistling breath escaped from her lungs . He stood watching her , wanting to wake her , not wanting to . She was like a candle , nearly spent , guttering out with a final glow  --  defying the night . He stood for a long time , looking at the tracks of time on her face and body . The tears he had kept back at the concert rolled down his face . Was it worth it ? " he whispered . Was it worth it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He had until tomorrow morning , then Final Decision . Final . No turning back . No changing his mind from that point on . He walked in the dark for an hour or two , trying to gather himself into one piece and failing . Moonlight glittered on the black lake , and the trees cast shadows of ink . He felt tired and a little disoriented . There was a place up ahead where he could rest . The path curved to the tiny wood building they called the chapel . He pushed the door open and went in . He had never bothered with it before , but he knew that some of the others had . He sat back in the dim room and looked down on a small dark arena . The bench he sat on was made of wood with a hard , curving back . In front of him lay a bank of controls . He pressed one at random . The arena took on a pale blue cast and a three-dimensional hexagram formed . A soft , almost subliminal voice said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a long white flowing beard clutched two stone tablets . David watched awhile , not really listening as the voice purred on , " . . . Thou shalt not kill . " Thou shalt not kill . If he stayed , was n't that what he 'd be doing ? To himself ? A shiver rippled down his back . He pressed the controls .  | A circle moved before him  --  yin and yang  --  as divided as his mind . Another button . A cross  --  with a man pinioned to it . Helpless as a butterfly on a board . Suffering eyes . Another button . A sunflower , yellow petals opening . Another . A serpent coiled itself into a figure eight . Confused , he pressed his hand over the controls to shut it off , but instead , he disengaged the speed . Below him , the scenes changed like shifting crystals in a kaleidoscope . The sunflower melting into a crescent with a star . . . the star flowing into the hexagram . . . unfolding into a cross . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower . All the while , soft voices whispering , " . . . Allah . . . . illusion . . . shalt not kill .... " He ran . He ran until the cool night air swept away the shifting scenes in his head . Back in his cabin with no hope of sleep , he dialed a communicator code . Prints began to tumble out of the machine ? a dozen , two dozen , more . . . . The complete works of Tanya Rolfe . He tuned his cythar and began to play what he could of her music . Sitting cross-legged on the floor , he played , his fingers moving from one set of strings to the other , leaping the ninety-degree angle easily . Only as he played did his mind relax . No thoughts flickered consciously , but the undercurrent sang from the plucked strings . She would n't die , she could n't die , as long as her music played . She would n't die , she could n't die . Only when he stopped did he think of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling away to nothing . Only when he stopped did he think of his music and how it would die while he lived on in smooth-muscled emptiness . He played until his fingers bled , and then he set aside his cythar and fitted his flute together . He fingered through the copies of her music , leaving little smears of blood on the pages . Then he came to the title-page of her last conserere . He read :  | SUMMER CONSERERE by Tanya Rolfe And below that , the dedication : To David Defour , who lives on . Why had n't she told him ? Why had n't she ? He felt a lump grow in his throat that was too hard and dry for tears . He looked at the inscription knowing that the meaning could be taken two ways , knowing also that it could have had only one meaning to Tanya Rolfe . And he knew , too , why she had n't told him . She knew he had to decide for himself . When the night faded to shades of gray , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a small recording device slung on his belt . Exhaustion had brought its own kind of peace . Spent , he sank down at the foot of a wide beech tree near the clearing . The first glow of the new sun began to color the hills . He crushed a blade of grass with his sore fingers , rolling it between them , inhaling its sharp , sweet smell . It was good to be alive . What would it be like to not be ? To not find out what lay beyond the next day ? To not see Thursday ? To never slide down the hills of April ? A rabbit rustled at the edge of the blackberry patch , nibbled tentatively at a blade of grass , thrust cut-velvet ears in his direction . He felt pity for it . It was so small , so ephemeral . Its moments fleeting as he watched . But it had to be what it was . He reached for the panpipes and blew a melody in a minor key to the little creature . It was a theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know just why the theme seemed important to him , but somehow it did . Somehow , it told him of the end of things  --  and of beginnings . The melody hung in the warm sweet air for a moment , and somehow that moment seemed a bit more alive to him . Then the ideas , the variations , came tumbling out of his  | panpipes . He laughed and touched the tiny recorder slung from his hip . And in his mind he could hear the orchestration ? swelling strings , then the theme whispered from a flute , answered by a kleidelphone , echoed by the dark double reeds . Now a muttered tympani , a variation by Weidner horn . It was all there . It was all there because it was his lot to create . And he realized suddenly that he was outrageously hungry . No wonder . It was getting late . It was time for him to tell them he was going to stay at Renascence  --  but only if they 'd give him breakfast .  | Liss had said to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He had taken that thought and turned it over in his mind and accepted it . It was a lie . He knew that now . David began to shake . He tried to control it , but as he tried , the trembling grew worse until it seemed as if his body were trying to fly apart , trying to separate itself from its core of hurt . With a hand that barely obeyed , he threw open the cabin door and rushed out into the dimming light . The mountain wilderness pressed in around him , making him feel vulnerable and utterly alone . It had been a long time since he 'd felt that way about Renascence  --  not since his first days there when the memories of Vesta were fresh . He looked up in the darkening sky . A satellite skimmed faintly overhead . And there , another . For a minute his thoughts shot out of him , projecting him into the sky , far beyond the satellites to the asteroid he 'd once called home . Back to the little boy he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any use . That little boy was gone . Dead . Finished . It was nearly dark . Flicking on the little light he carried on his belt , he walked on along the familiar paths through dark woods . He came to a clearing and began to cut across the grassy meadow . Something moved once in the shadows and was gone . He found the fawn near the soft clay banks of a spring  | run . A bobcat had killed it . The cat 's prints lay deep in the beam of his light . A hemlock branch above the kill bent from the recent weight it had supported . The cat had waited , watching the fawn in the grass at the edge of the clearing . Then it had leaped , landing on the little deer 's spine , paralyzing it with sharp claws . The fawn lay warm beside him , its guts spilling in an obscene heap by his feet . He ran his hand over its head , its ears . He whispered , " Does everything have to die at Renascence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his soul and left it as ruined as the young deer . It was the same fawn he was sure . The one he 'd seen at dawn three weeks ago . Leaving it , he stumbled away toward the spot where he 'd waited alone that morning . He felt a grim satisfaction that the bobcat would go hungry while he was there . It would n't dare come back to its meal while a human was around . He lowered himself to the damp ground , cradling his head in his cupped hands , looking at nothing as the moon rose over the back of the mountain . The ring he wore pressed into his scalp . He raised his hand to his face , trying to see the ring in the dim light . Abruptly , he tugged at it , meaning to pull it off , fling it away , as if the action would undo that morning three weeks ago when they 'd put it on his finger . It was too tight . He would wear it always . He turned his face to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd felt lightheaded and a little shaky when he 'd stood up in the early light three weeks ago . He had narrowed his eyes against the rising sun that reddened the sky over Trey Mountain . The small wooden buildings of Renascence lay in the deep shadow of the hills . He was hungry . He had n't eaten for nearly two days . He wiped the dew from his panpipes onto the rough cloth of his outer shirt and hooked the little instrument to his belt . Across the clearing , a fawn browsing at the new grass on the forest 's edge froze at his movement . He froze too , looking at it , thinking , it 's all right . All right , pretty thing . No one here wants to hurt you .  | They stood for a full minute looking at each other . Then it moved and was gone in the rising mists of a spring that ran from among the roots of a dark hemlock . He made his way toward one of the buildings , feeling the grass give beneath his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad for that ; he was n't ready just yet to talk to anyone . The communicator screen showed him the breakfast choices and he punched up the code for two complete meals . Piling all the food on one tray , he carried it outside to the edge of the lake and walked across the narrow stone bridge to a tiny island near the shore . He sat down leaning his back against a tree , balancing his tray across his knees . He poured great gouts of honey and cream over the bowl of hot oatmeal . Eating too fast for tasting , he tried not to let the thoughts that lay just beneath his mind bubble to the surface ; he allowed himself only one  --  eat now . The mist rose like a thousand smokes from the lake . He pushed his food aside and raised a steaming cup to his lips . In an hour  --  in less than an hour  --  Final Decision . The food lay heavy on his stomach . He would sit there for the hour , he would tell them what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He crumbled a crust of bread between his fingers , mounding it in a heap . Bit by bit , he tossed it into the water . Bream rose to feed . Their hungry mouths sent small ripples through the water . David watched the widening circles as if he were hypnotized until a splash sent its wake toward the little island . It was M'Kumbe . The tall black boy walked naked through the shallows toward a deeper part of the lake . Soon he was swimming , long thin arms pulling his body through the cold water . Early sunlight glinted on his wet skin . The boy swam on , passing close to David 's island , not looking , not speaking . It was a matter of privacy for them both . Both made Final Decision that morning . Across the lake in the dark trees , a wood thrush sang a song of melting sadness . When the hour was up , David walked the short way back to the dining hall and left off his tray . A group of twelve-year- olds pushed past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  older than sixteen . Without speaking , he walked the path along the lake toward the open pavilion . People were waiting for him . There were three of them wearing mole-gray robes brightened with the hoods of their art . Rose pink , for music , fell from the robe of one  --  Tanya Rolfe . She had been his teacher for five years , he thought , and he had seen her nearly every day . But , how different she looked in her robe . So frail . So old now . Delicate as the moth he 'd found in his cabin . It bore rose spots on its soft gray wings . He 'd saved it in a little box for a long time , and then he 'd opened it one day , and as he touched the small creature , it fell away to dust . He looked at the others . A tall man with a gray-black beard showed the gold of science . The last , a dark-eyed woman , wore the white of arts and letters . The three sat together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose from across the water , ruffling his hair , stirring the soft robes of the three . No one spoke . In a minute , M'Kumbe came and stood beside him , and then a girl called Sabra . Dry tear-tracks stained her face . Tanya Rolfe spoke first in a voice as thin and old as cracking parchment . " Once before , you three stood before a committee much like this one . You pledged your changing years to test yourselves . Now , you have come to Final Decision . " She paused to draw a shallow breath through failing lungs . " Today , you must choose your path . There is no turning back . " She looked away then , across the lake as if across a great distance . The tall man began to read from a thin roll of paper : " When death died , when humankind held immortality in its grasp , it exulted . Now was time rolled out forever . Time to contemplate . To sow . To reap . " But , immortality brought another death  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in humankind to reach beyond itself into forever . " And so , humankind had to designate its special children as guardians of the arts . It had to say to them , Be mortal , some of you , so that all our lives may have meaning . ' " You are these children , these guardians . " He paused and  | then he said , " You have come to the day of Final Decision . And so I put the question to you  --  do you choose physical immortality with the full knowledge that it will bring the death of your art ? Or do you deny , knowing that your only immortality will be that of such creative works as live after you ? " The man looked at them , then said , " How do you choose , M'Kumbe Elthree ? " The black boy touched long fingers together , lightly , yet with the tension of steel springs . " I choose  --  I choose to deny ? " " I will read the Charge of Mortality , " said the man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head seemed to hum . The man 's voice ran together in meaningless sounds . And then he heard M'Kumbe say , " I confirm . " " And you , Sabra Beseven ? How do you choose ? " The girl 's voice rose in a shaky soprano , " I choose immortality . " " I will read the Charge of Immortality . After which you must confirm . " The girl nodded . Tears began to course down her face . The man read from the thin paper again . " With the choice of immortality , you , Sabra Beseven , confirm that the application of your art , that of creative thought in the field of science , will no longer be your work . You confirm that any further work in this field will necessarily be confined to the work of technician . You further confirm that the right to reproduce yourself is denied by law and by the immortality process itself unless specifically countermanded by the Ministry of Population . Do you so confirm ? " " I do . " The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose , David Defour ? " He felt giddy , as if he were going to lose his balance . After a few seconds he said , " I choose to deny . " The man nodded almost imperceptibly . " I will read the Charge of Mortality . At that point you must confirm : " With the choice of mortality , you , David Defour , confirm that physical death is a certainty . You confirm that the  | choice of mortality is no guarantee of the success of your art , that of music and composition . You further confirm the right to marry and reproduce yourself if you so choose . " His throat felt dry . He tried to say the final words and with an effort they came out . " I  --  confirm . " His head whirled . The next few minutes blurred forever in his mind . At one point , he knew he reached toward the girl next to him and tried to say , " No . Please do n't cry , " but he had no air , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , he saw the tear-bright eyes of Tanya Rolfe shining from her wrinkled face . Someone took his hand and pressed a ring on his finger . He looked at it . And then , through a trick of light perhaps , a flash from the brilliant sun onto the gold and black of the ring blazed the design into his brain forever  --  a broken symbol of infinity  --  and then the words : " For Art . " He left the pavilion and walked through the woods back to his cabin . He pushed open the door . The room was a confusion of paper , heaps of paper  --  the complete works of Tanya Rolfe . He had dialed them the night before and the communicator had spit them into his room . The scores lay everywhere : on the floor , propped on his music stand , layered in fanning sheets across the communicator bank and the symphosizer keyboard that stood against one wall . One sheet lay on top . It was the title page of Tanya Rolfe 's new conserere , and underneath her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives on . He was exhausted ; he had n't slept . He 'd played her music through the night . Pushing the lever for his bed , he threw himself on it when it unrolled . When he closed his eyes , all he could see was a shining gold ring and a broken lazy figure eight . After a time , he slept . Moth wings brushed across his lips . He stirred . Moth wings brushed his eyes . " Poor David . "  | " What ? " He opened his eyes and looked up . Frank blue eyes stared back . " Oh , Liss , " he said , " what time is it ? " " Time you got up . It 's nearly supper . " She waggled a basket under his nose . " I 've brought us a picnic . " His legs and arms felt heavy  --  as if he 'd been drugged . He rubbed his eyes and then , at the touch of cool metal , pulled his hand away and stared stupidly at the ring he wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the ring for a few moments , then she stood up . " Come on . Let 's eat . You 're much too thin to miss meals . " She reached for his hand and tugged . Protesting , he let himself be led outside . They walked in silence for a while past the cabins toward the lake . When Liss did n't turn off toward the island , he said , " Where are we going ? " " Someplace different . " They walked along the edge of the lake and stood on the grassy earthen dam . In the center , the water plunged over a spillway . Nothing but forest lay below them . " Uncharted territory , so to speak . " Liss had begun to climb down the steep side of the spillway . In a moment , all he could see was the top of her head . He stood watching her as her head poked up over the rocks . " Well , come on . " " Come on , where ? " " To the bottom . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spillway ended and the remains of a natural waterfall course fell on beyond it . It was steep . He hesitated . Liss looked up . " Come on . If I can do it lugging this basket , you can do it empty handed . " Still sleepy , he shook his head in puzzlement and swung a leg down onto the rocks below . Reaching for handholds , he clambered down . Spray from the spillway misted over him . Here and there , moss grew on the rocks , turning to slick jelly under the pressure of his fingers . When he reached the bottom , he looked up . He could n't see the man-made spillway from there , only the water roaring over polished rocks . They were in a narrow gorge . Steep-sided hills rose on either side . At points , the tree branches met  | overhead sending broken sunlight through their leaves to dance on the water below . Liss had moved on , making a path  --  here walking on fairly level ground ; there grabbing a branch to keep from falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They came to a series of flat rocks . Stepping from one to another , she crossed . Water poured between the rocks as the stream continued its downward plunge . She stopped on a wide rock ledge and set down the basket . He followed . She sat on the rock , pulled off her shoes , and plunged her feet into the frigid pool . " How did you find this place ? " he asked . She wiggled her toes in the water . " Most people here go up on the mountain to think . I come down here . Take off your shoes and dunk your toes . It 's good for your brain . " " I can imagine , " he said wryly . " It is . Cools off fevered thoughts and brows . " " Well , in that case , I guess I 'd better . " He pulled off his shoes , laying them next to hers , and thrust his feet into the water . Across the pool the water poured in a steady cascade , spreading its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Along one side , a thicket of pink mountain laurel bloomed . " I think it 's symbolic , " she said . " What is ? " " This place . It 's at the edge . " " The edge ? " " The edge of Renascence . We 're at the boundary here . " She pointed toward the waterfall , " Up there is what we 've known . It 's safe and civilized . But all around us is wilderness ? the unknown , like our future . " He considered this . He said nothing . " I guess you 're not used to symbolic thinking , though . Are you , technician ? " He laughed . It had been a long time since he 'd resented her calling him that , not since they 'd first come to Renascence , not since they were a couple of scared eleven-yearolds . " Not everybody from Vesta is a technician , " he said . She looked at the ring he wore , then looked away , and as  | she looked away the rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . I guess not everybody . " He lay back across the rock , cradled his head in his cupped hands and looked up at the sky . " Do you ever miss living up there in the Belt , Liss ? Do you miss it at all ? " She leaned back , cushioning her head on his shoulder . " I did for a while . I still do  --  some . But I 'll miss Earth worse . I know I will . " He felt his voice grow stilted as he said , " You 're still going then ? You 're sure about your Final Decision ? " " I 'm sure . " " You wo n't miss not having a child ? " " I do n't know . I 've never had one and I do n't miss it now . Since so few immortals are allowed to have one , I guess it wo n't matter . I 'll just keep on taking after-pills , " she said , " and go on like before . " She looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is the way I feel about my parents . I 'm afraid they 'll be disappointed . You never knew yours , David , so maybe you do n't know what I mean , but mine are mortal  --  everything they live for is their art . My mother 's poetry , my father 's painting  --  these things mean everything to them . But , I ca n't live up to them . I 'm a poet without virtue . " " What do you mean ? " " Did n't you ever read Aristotle ? " She peeped at him slyly , little laugh lines forming at the corners of her eyes . He scowled , trying to look stern . She laughed , " Oh , you are still a technician ? " " Well , you ca n't make an L-5 out of an Echo . " She rolled over and looked down at him , wrinkling up her little nose sprinkled with brown-sugar freckles . " Anyway , Aristotle said , The virtue of a knife is to cut . ' So , it follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She looked away for a moment , serious now . " If what I produce is n't poetry , then that makes me a poet without virtue . That 's why I 'm leaving , David . " He did n't answer ; he was looking at her nose . It seemed to him that it was the most delicious-looking nose in all creation . He reached up and took gentle hold of her ears , pulled  | her down to him and then he kissed that nose and the lips underneath . Somehow , he could n't stop . His hand slid down her throat and rested on her breast . They had made love before , casually , or out of a strong physical need , or even to comfort one another , but it was different now . She was leaving in a few weeks ; he was staying . Somehow that made it more precious  --  almost unbearably precious . " Oh , Liss , " he whispered . Their clothes commingled in an untidy heap and cushioned their yielding bodies against the hard flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew it  --  knew that she knew it , too . He loved her , and it echoed in the throbbing of his body and the pounding of his heart . She could n't go . She could n't . If she did , what would become of him ? He shuddered and clung to her . After a time , they drew apart , and when they did it was more than a simple separation . It was as if the chill of space intervened and drew her away from him , pulling her back to the colony she was born to . " You 're really going ? " he said finally . " Yes . " They pulled on their clothes silently . Then they spread out their food and picked at it with the pretense of appetite . The sky grew red with sunset . In the thick brush a wood thrush penetrated the rush of waterfall with a song so sweet , so sad that David felt his heart constrict . Her hands moved , putting things away in the little basket , packing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it 's getting late . " When he came back , his cabin was clean , his bed rolled , and the untidy piles of music had been stacked neatly . He was puzzled . Up to now the cleaning , or the lack of it , had been left largely to him . The red message light glowed on the communicator . He pressed it . A voice said , " The mortal colonies of Earth , its satellites , and the neighboring asteroids welcome you , David Defour , to their society . " Certain privileges come with your decision for mortal life . You now have at your disposal quite a large allowance for  | goods and services . And , in two years when you join the Society of Adults , unlimited travel allowances will also be yours . " Do you have any requests at this time ? " He thought about it . He could get something for Liss . To keep . A necklace maybe . Something she could see and touch that would remind her of him . Something  --  the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind about leaving . It needed to be symbolic ; she loved symbols . He could n't think of anything . Then , it came to him . He could give her one of those purple stones they found at Renascence now and then . What were they ? Amethyst . He punched the vocorder . " I 'd like a necklace . For a girl . " " Certainly . Details , please . " " An amethyst . Set in gold . On a chain . " " Do you have any further requests ? " He stood pondering the question . He 'd had everything he needed , really . There was n't anything else except  --  His eyes fell on his cythar . It leaned up against the music stand in the center of the room . He 'd had it for years ; he 'd brought it with him from Vesta . It was a good one , with a rich deep tone , and yet .... He pressed the vocorder and said , " May I have a new cythar ? " " Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kind he wanted . " Handmade with realgut strings . " He paused , thinking about it . He could have any kind he wanted  --  the best . Hesitantly , he said , " One made by Schimmermann , please . A good one . " " Received . Place your hand over the visio so that the ring you wear imprints . " He raised his hand . The metal of the ring caused a momentary blue glow to flash on the screen . " Received . " He sat down and contemplated his good fortune . A Schimmermann . He was going to own a real Schimmermann cythar . He looked at his old one . He 'd learned to play on it . He picked it up and turned it over in his hands . The body of  | the instrument was scarred a little from years of use . He ran his fingers over the strings , plucking softly . His flute and his cythar were the only things he had left from his old life on Vesta . That , and his name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd placed him in when he was born . He looked at the cythar , feeling as if he 'd been disloyal to it . He did n't want to give it up . He put it down , went back to the communicator , and pushed the vocorder again . " My old cythar , " he said , " may I keep it ? May I have them both ? " " Certainly . " He grinned . And then his sudden affluence went to his head . He said , " And I want some ice cream . Now . All different kinds with chocolate syrup on top . " He started to place his ring against the visio and then he paused as invention came to him . " And on top of that , I want a banana all cut up . And then a peach . And then more chocolate . " Tanya Rolfe smiled at him , and the smile increased the wrinkles on her face in geometric proportions . " I see you have a new cythar . " He nodded . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument to him . It was everything he 'd hoped for , and more . " And did you order everything you could think of , David , with your newfound wealth ? " " Well , this , " he ran his fingers over the smooth body of the instrument . " And a necklace for Liss . " Then , with a sheepish look , " and a tub of ice cream . " She laughed . " I remember what I did . I did n't practice my music for nearly a week . My little room was brimming over with things until there was n't any room for me . And then do you know what I did ? " He shook his head . " I sent nearly everything back , and I gave most of the rest away . " She looked at him keenly . " When we know we can have nearly everything we want  --  at any time , then the need seems to vanish and we do n't really want it anymore . At least that 's the way it works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushed her hands together , dismissing the problem . " We 're wasting  | your lesson . Let me see what you 've been doing with your variation from Beethoven . " Resting his cythar against his chair , he pressed a code on the communicator . Sheets bearing his latest composition rolled out of the machine . She looked them over , holding them close to her failing eyes . Then she said , " Good , David . Good . " He could n't believe it . No corrections ? No changes ? He waited cautiously , sure that she had more to say . Finally , she took his firm hands in hers . " It 's the best you 've done . " He flushed with pleasure . It was the first undiluted praise she 'd ever given him . He did n't know what to say . She leaned back in her chair , her breath coming in reedy little gasps . She looked at him for a moment through halfclosed eyes and then she said , " I wonder now , David , where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There just was n't any pleasing her in the final analysis . None at all . " I thought you liked it . " " I do . " " Then what is it ? " He clutched the score , rumpling it between his fingers . " Is it the ending ? Do you think it 's too short ? You think it 's incomplete ? " " Oh , David . " The smile again . " David , David . You do n't listen . I will tell you again . It 's the best thing you 've done . Now , where are you going with this ? " " I do n't know what you mean . " She did n't speak for a moment . Then she said , " Go to the window there and look out . " His eyebrow quirked . She was getting old . Humoring her , he got up and walked to the window of her cabin . " What do you see ? " " Woods . A creek . Then a green field on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what she was talking about , but he said , " Not much else . Just the trees . The creek and a bridge . Then , the field . " " And where are you , David ? " He found this line of talk exasperating . Obviously , she  | did n't mean for him to say he was standing by the window . She liked to talk in riddles and symbols  --  just like Liss . They were a pair . When they did this to him , he felt annoyed and a little backward , as if he were a dim child who could n't quite comprehend . He felt his lips press together . She asked him again , " Where are you now ? " He knew she 'd keep pecking away at him until he got her point . He looked out of the window again . Tall oaks , heavy with green , towered over the cabin . The understory thinned near the creek . A small stone footbridge led across . He shook his head . " And where was Beethoven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she meant , and then suddenly it came to him . Beethoven was a transitional composer , leading the way from the old Classical period to the Romantic . " Beethoven was on the bridge , " he said . She laughed softly , " Good . Now , come sit down , David . I wo n't torture you with any more symbols . " He sat down and faced her . He felt a smile play around his lips . " You . ' re trying to tell me something so that I wo n't forget . " " It helps our focus sometimes to do that , " she said . " You 're on the bridge , too , David . I want you to think about where it is you 're going . " " You mean , my music 's transitional . " She nodded . " Can you see where it 's going ? " It was going to the only place it could , he thought . He had no idea how to answer her . His music just was . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimed itself there without help from him . She sat waiting for him to answer . What did she want of him , anyway ? It made him uneasy , this analyzing she put him through . He searched for an answer that would satisfy her . " Well , " he said finally , " we 're in the Tertiary Romantic period now , but ? " " But ? " Her eyes searched his . " Well , it leaves something out , do n't you think ? " She did n't speak , making him feel as if he had to go on . " I mean , the emotions in the music . . . . They 're beautiful . The mu- sic 's beautiful , but everything is n't always beautiful . It 's so high-flown . It just is n't real . " " You mean , it does n't reflect life ? " He thought about that for a moment , then he nodded . " Yes . I guess that 's it . " " So that 's where you 're going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widened slightly ; he 'd never thought of that before . Her voice was soft . " It would be an interesting path . " She looked out of the cabin window , but she seemed not to see . After a few moments , she said to him , " And how will you make your music real , David ? " " I 'm not sure , yet , " he said , " but I know there 's a way . Part of it is in multi-modal work , the way you work with a visiographer . But it 's more than holos moving in and out of music . " His dark eyes glowed as he talked , " It 's more than that . I feel it . More than pretty sunsets blending with soloboes and fireflies ? " He stopped , blushing furiously . He was hideously embarrassed ; he 'd been talking , without realizing it , about Tanya Rolfe 's latest work  --  her " Summer Conserere . " He blurted , " I 'm sorry . I did n't mean that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant it , David . " She reached out and patted his hand . " You had no choice . You have your own music . Do n't apologize for that . You have to send your music out of your soul like a monument . Like the song these mountains sing here at Renascence . " His eyes grew wide and questioning . She patted his hand again . She nodded . " Oh , yes . These mountains sing , David . The birds know it . " If Liss had knocked at his door , he had n't heard it . He sat on the floor and twiddled dials and pushed buttons on an array of miniaturized equipment littering the floor . Stacks of communicator print-outs teetered precariously on his desk while a stray sheet or two rose and fell in the breeze from his window . He was totally absorbed in what he was doing . She stood for a full minute in the doorway watching him ,  | then she said , " No wonder you 're so thin . Your eat-meter is broken . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thought you 'd call me for supper , but I can see now you never got a single hunger pang . " He grinned . " What would I do without you to look after me ? " She looked at him thoughtfully . " I guess you 'll have to learn . " He did n't seem to hear her . His head bent low over the litter on the floor . He seemed to be listening to something else . " Maybe I 'd better put you up for adoption , " she said softly . " What ? " " Nothing . What are you doing ? " " Working on a new piece . Tanya gave me the idea . Want to hear some of it ? " " You mean you 're actually going to let me hear one of your compositions before it 's finished ? " " This one time . " His hands flew , adjusting dials , touching here and there . " It 's not a composition . It 's a fragment . A component . " He touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There . " She waited for the music to begin . Nothing happened . Nothing at all . " What ? " she began . He put his fingers to his lips . " Wait . " She waited . The room was silent . Then she began to giggle . " David , you 're brilliant . A real innovator . Music without sound . You 've given me an idea for a poem . " She rummaged at his music stand and found a piece of staved paper . Turning it over to its blank back side , she pretended to write . " There . " She handed it to him . " My masterpiece . " He held the sheet in his hand , not looking at it at all , but staring at her in a most intent way . " David ? " She tilted her head at him and shook it in mock sorrow . She made little " tch-tch " sounds with her tongue . Then she said , " I remember when you were a whole and somewhat sound individual . Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She reached for his hand . " Let 's go eat , while we can . It 's going to rain . " A delighted grin spread over his face . " No , it 's not . " She let go of his hand and stared at him . " It 's not going to rain . " He grinned again  --  wider . " Look . " He showed her one of the dials . A green line pulsed up and down leaving a faint luminous trail behind it . " That 's music ? " " Not yet . But , that 's your rain  --  and that . " He pushed a small box toward her . Her nose wrinkled slightly . Liss glanced out of the window , puzzled . " David , what are you talking about ? " " This . " He pointed at the dial again . " Remember the storm yesterday ? " She nodded . " I recorded it . " She raised an eyebrow slightly . " I do n't hear any thunder . " " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the sound of the storm itself  --  the air disturbances , changes in ionization . The storm was miles away when I recorded it . And the sound was below the audible range  --  infrasound . " " But , I do n't hear anything . " " Of course not . You ca n't . It 's too low to hear . But it 's not too low to feel . You 're not aware of it though . It 's subliminal . " He sat on the floor , holding his knees , looking up at her with an air of supreme satisfaction . " What does the box have to do with it ? " " Oh . Ions . It 's an ionizer . I just used it to simulate unstable storm conditions . I set it to fluctuate from positive to negative . " " So , I have been effectively deceived . " Liss plopped to the floor next to him , sitting cross-legged amid the litter . " Tell me , technician , is this Art ? " His grin faded , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really . Unless you want to empty your outdoor concert halls . Who wants to sit in the rain ? " " It 's what you do all the time , Liss , in your poetry . It 's symbolic . "  | " Infrasound metaphors ? " " Yes . " He seemed delighted that she understood . " With infrasound , I can transplant people with music . " " With thunderstorms ? " The eyebrow quirked again . " I 'm trying to tell you , " he said with a touch of irritation . " If I write music about Renascence , people will feel it . They 'll feel the weather , the mountains ? " " The mountains ? " " That 's right . They give off infrasound too , Liss . Through tectonic movements . The birds know it . That 's one of the ways they navigate during migration . Every mountain range has a different sound , a different feel ? " A look came across his face ; it was as if he were hearing something far away , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mountains are beacons . " They finished their supper , stacked their trays and stepped outside the dining hall . They walked the path together , hands touching now and then as if to reaffirm a closeness . " There 's a play in the Shed , " said Liss . " Want to go ? " He walked for a while without answering , then he said , " No . I do n't want to see a play tonight . I want ? " He looked at her shyly . " I want to see you . I 've got something for you . A present . " She stopped and looked at him . A smile spread over her face , then suddenly , without a ripple it was gone . " It 's a goingaway present , I guess . " His eyes searched her face , " It does n't have to be . " She turned away from him and looked out over the lake . Her hands touched together , fingers stroked each other , pulled apart , touched again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He thrust his hands deep in his pockets , took a step away from her , stopped . They stood facing away from each other . A minute passed , then two , and then they were turning , touching , saying together , " I 'm sorry , " then laughing at the coincidence . Their lips brushed in a whisper of a kiss . " Liss ? " he began , stopping when he felt his voice begin to break . Her eyes were blue mist . She shook her head just barely  | and touched a stilling finger to his lips . " We have three days , David . That 's all . Then they 'll send me home . " He drew in a slow breath , found his voice and found that he did n't want to use it . He had wanted to ask if she 'd remember him . But it was n't a fair question . Better to ask if she 'd remember the mountains after they crumbled away . Better not to ask at all . After a few moments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little necklace with its single amethyst . He fumbled with the chain , trying to open the tiny catch . Failing , he closed his hand on it , pressing it into a little wad of chain and stone , and put it in her hand . She did n't look at it ; the tears were filling up her eyes too fast for looking . She managed a half-choked " Thank you , " then she was running away from him , head down , hand curled tight around the necklace . In a moment , she was gone . He did n't want to be alone . He most especially did n't want to be alone just then . If he stayed by himself for very long , he knew that a flood of emotion would rise up and drown him . He looked down the path where Liss had run and he wanted to follow , but he could n't . The setting sun colored the mountains with purple . He began to walk , cutting away from the path , moving through the woods . Without planning-it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The door was unlocked . He knocked , received no answer , pushed open the door and stepped inside . She was sitting in a chair by the window . The glow of the setting sun tinted her thin white hair with rose and pink . A strand of her hair caught in the breeze rose and fell , rose and fell . Nothing else moved . Nothing . He felt a heavy cold begin in his stomach . He felt it spread . " Tanya ? " He moved closer to her chair . In the evening light , her skin gave off a faint yellow cast as if it had been coated with the thinnest layer of wax . Her open eyes stared at the dying evening light and gave back none . Her hands lay in  | her lap , still , fingers lightly curled as if pressed to the keys of a musical instrument . The setting sun reflected on a slim black and gold ring with a broken symbol of eternity . The cold spread through him , numbing him , freezing him in his footsteps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the final thing . The final note dying away until nothing was left , not an echo , nothing . He 'd never seen death before . Never . He 'd never even seen age until he 'd come to Renascence . He looked at her with mingled fear and love and horror , and the horror of it was that nothing was there at all . There had been music and speech and thought and now there was nothing . He had to do something . He looked wildly around the room , staring at her things  --  her music stand , her thin old china teapot , her cup that sat nearly full of cooling tea . He thought , at last , of the communicator . He ran to it , reached out with hands that shook , and pressed an emergency code . Finally , the doctor came . The sobs racked his body and sucked the breath from him until he thought he must be dying . Hot tears ran through his fingers and dripped onto the cold damp earth . At last , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tears , dry of emotion , conscious only of the scent of earth and crushed grass in his nostrils and a heavy aching fatigue . At the edge of the meadow the torn body of the little deer cooled rapidly in the mountain night , while nearby , among the black shadows of brush and trees , a hungry bobcat waited .  | Dayglow was beginning to fade when Kurt Kraus debarked from the skiptor . The Vestans in the Arrow boarding area stared curiously at him and at the man who accompanied him , the man with graying hair and hawk eyes  --  the man who had no legs . He glided alongside Kurt on the rubberized treads of his prosthesis . They entered the Arrow together . Kurt took the seat reserved for him . The man swung beside . In response to a neural command , the prosthesis lowered him to a sitting position . The Arrow began to move , accelerating rapidly through a tunnel . Then it burst into the open periphery of the asteroid . The artificial sunset glowed on the walls of housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turf . As the Arrow sped beyond Dome-Lake Park , Kurt could see City Central in the distance . He looked around him . The Arrow passengers stared back . He could feel hostility mixed with their curiosity . The hostility was growing . It was more open , more evident , on each new trip he made to the colony , and it was directed toward the people of Earth and the mortals of Renascence . The rift had been widening between Earth and the Belt . Vesta was the epicenter of the discontent , which had spread in broadening circles until it influenced all the colonies , even to the Guardian Force of L-5 ? the Guardian Force that controlled the warheads of WorldCo from the high ground of  | LeGrange , the Guardian Force that had ensured the peace for nearly two hundred years . With each ripple of dissatisfaction , WorldCo 's Ministry had responded , yet in spite of coercion from Commerce and Industry , in spite of the guidance of Education and the subtler , yet pervasive , efforts of Communication , the chasm deepened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his companion to City Central . He looked at the man next to him  --  the man WorldCo hoped was the key to the solution  --  Jesus Ramirez , the man who had conceived and developed the Ramirez Star Drive . The serving dishes glided in a slow ellipse around the table . Kurt took a serving of Vestan duck as it wheeled by him . The host smiled cherubically as he watched the men and women of the Ministry . And as he watched , he fingered the heavy silver T that hung at his throat . Thin cylinders , flared at the top , passed by , half-full of a straw-colored liquid . " I hope you 'll try our wine , " said Silvio . " It 's from the Riesling grape . Earth stock , but the minerals in Vestan soil give it a distinctive flavor . " Kurt lifted his glass and sipped appreciatively as he looked at his host . He had not seen him since the day he and the cryptists inspected the children 's records at Vesta Central . He remembered their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just ca n't believe he 's lying , Mr. Kraus . Perhaps it really was accidental . . . although I do n't quite see how .... " He stared covertly at Tarantino . He seemed quite affable , this little dark-eyed man . He seemed quite open . What was it about him that was disturbing ? The man ate little , drank little . His protocol was flawless . He seemed to be the perfect combination of relaxed deference and quick intelligence  --  exactly right for an Under Minister . Too exact , perhaps . Too perfect . His eyes narrowed slightly as he looked at Tarantino . Something hung at the edges of his memory  --  something very long ago . But as he tried to grasp it , it slipped away .  | When the meal was over , the service sector of the table disappeared into a lower level . It was replaced by flared snifters one-quarter filled with an excellent fortified wine , again Riesling , but syrupy , with a tang to its sweetness . Heinrich Richter , envoy to Prime Minister Gerstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began with carefully worded diplomatic language to explore the relations between Earth and the colonies . This was in prelude to WorldCo 's formal proposal . When it came , no one at the table was surprised . Each had been carefully briefed in advance . The meeting was in formal and open deference to the colonies . " And so , " said Richter in his careful voice , " in recognition of a deep , and perhaps archetypal human need , we perceive that when horizons draw near and frontiers close , human beings grow uneasy . When the catalyst of immortal life is added , a future without goals , without aspirations , becomes untenable . " Until now , even with the knowledge of life everlasting , our horizons have been restricted to the planets and planetoids that circle this little sun . The stars seemed reachable only through centuries of boredom in constricted surroundings  --  a journey to nowhere , a fool 's errand . Now , through the dedication of this man , " and here Richter indicated Jesus Ramirez , " our horizons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the galaxy can be ours . It is our hope , our intention , to reunite the people of Earth and the colonies in this outreach . Once again , humankind will seek a goal . Once again , humankind will join its mind and its spirit in a quest ? a quest for self-fulfillment and knowledge that will lead to the ends of the universe . " To Kurt , the dross of the envoy 's rhetoric was consumed by the bright fire at its center . He looked at the man beside him and he felt a fierce pride . He was a product of Renascence , this man , a true immortal in an aging , damaged body . Because of him , because of Renascence , people could begin to dream again . The formal discussion began and proceeded around the table . Just before Kurt 's statement , a man entered the room ,  | spoke briefly to Silvio and then stepped to Kurt 's side and handed him a message . He read it . It was only a few words : " Tanya Rolfe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave his statement automatically . Without conscious thought , his prepared speech rolled out with the accuracy of a computer , while part of him retreated to a hidden place where no one reached , where no one could . When the meeting broke up into informal groups , he excused himself and left abruptly . By the time Kurt had accepted the fact that his plan to get thoroughly drunk had failed , it was very late . He left his hotel room and began to walk the streets of Vesta . He avoided the zont and the main publicway and stuck to the narrower , more private , sideways . And as he walked , the memories began to play in his mind like ghosts ... . A little girl  --  very grave , very , very serious  --  playing a peleforte , singing in a clear , true voice . The first child  --  the first one . Almost like his own child ... . And then she was a slim girl of sixteen making her Final Decision : She stood before him and the others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gave back no light . She wore soft white that followed the movements of her body . Her eyes were very black , very grave as they looked into his . And to him , she was beautiful . He held her hand and placed a ring on her finger , a ring with the broken symbol of infinity . She was the first . The first one ... . He walked the empty sideways as the sweet , the bitter memories played on : A young woman , walking with him in the woods of autumn . He had felt in awe of her a little , and envious . She seemed to know so well where she was going . They had stopped for a while under the red leaves of a maple . The sky was very blue overhead ; the air was sharp with a cool tang that tasted of minerals and arctic ice . They entered a small ravine , crushing bright leaves under their feet , half-running , half-sliding down to the banks of a shining stream that hopped from rock to rock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked precariously along  | its edge until the stream slid away down the face of a broad smooth stone that slanted into a little pool below it . There the forest opened and Blood Mountain struggled against the sky in the distance . She stopped then under a dark hemlock and broke off a twig , crushing the needles between her fingers , sniffing deeply . " I love this scent , Kurt . To me , it is the essence of Renascence , clean and wild . " She held the broken twig under his nose . The pungent scent brought back to him a time very long ago  --  a Christmas tree , a small boy held close in loving arms . The world had been newly minted then , and to him , nothing had been so sharply etched , so sweet as that , until now . He kissed her then , and held her , held her as if to let go would be to die . He ran his hands over her slim body , stripping it of clothes , reveling in the touch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her , the taste . They clung together , as if by clinging they could be one creature , one throbbing , feeling , touching creature . And when his shuddering climax came , he could n't draw away . Not yet . It was n't enough . Not enough . Not ever enough . And when they drew apart at last and pulled on clothes aflame with dying leaves , he reached out and touched her hair , her throat . " Come with me . Come live with me , Tanya . I need you . " She did n't answer just then . She stood and reached out a hand to him . He took it . And the sun shone on their two hands and sparkled on the broken gold figure on the ring she wore . She held his face between her hands then and looked at it . And after that , she dropped her arms to her sides and turned away . She stared through the flaming leaves at the mountains for a long time before she said , " We walk on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he looked at her and found her beautiful . As the years passed , he saw her age . As the years lined her face and streaked her hair with white , he came often to Renascence . He listened to her music and to her soft voice . They walked in the woods together in soft spring rains while small birds sang . They walked in summer and in the crisp  | frosts of October . They walked against the icy winds of winter , and he found her beautiful . And then when she became too old , too infirm , for their walks together , he still came , but not as often . And they sat together in the warmth of her cabin , drinking wild tea sweetened with honey . She smiled and reached out , ruffling his hair in a teasing way as she would a son , or a grandson . For the first time he saw how frail she was , how fragile . I 'm going to watch you die . I 'm going to live and watch you die . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said , " Goodbye , " and then he left , shutting the cabin door softly behind him . He had not been back to Renascence since then .  | A sick anger budded and bloomed inside David as he watched the hover land at Renascence and discharge its cargo of smooth-faced immortals into the sun . They congregated in the clearing , these people of rank and importance . They had given up a day or two of forever to come to the funeral of the woman who had amused them with her music and her life . He hated them for it . He watched them group in little clumps and knots in the clearing , renewing acquaintance , laughing , conversing . His hands drew into fists . " Damn them , " he said aloud . Liss 's hand touched his , running softly across the tense skin over his knuckles . Another hover came into sight over the treetops . It slowed and dropped to a gentle landing . " It 's a novelty , is n't it ? " he said bitterly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives them a thrill . " She fingered the little amethyst on the gold chain around her neck . That is n't fair , David , " she said . " They 've come to show the respect they had for her . She was n't just another mortal artist , you know . She was special . She was the first mortal . " " The first mortal ? " Liss sighed faintly . " You do n't know much about her , do you ? " He snorted , " Only every piece of music she ever wrote . " " I 'm not talking about her music , David . "  | He looked at her , puzzled . It had never entered his head that Tanya Rolfe could be considered apart from her music . It was as if the two were so intertwined that trying to separate them would be useless , senseless . " She was the first mortal , " said Liss evenly , " the first to deny immortality . She came here over ninety years ago , David . Imagine how alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed the ring all of you wear . Did you know that ? " He shook his head . He was acutely conscious of her phrase , " the ring all of you wear . " Liss 's Final Decision was n't until tomorrow , and yet she had already drawn herself away from him , aligned herself with the throng in the clearing . Somehow this cutting off of herself hurt him more than anything else . After a minute he said stiffly , " I suppose you learned all that when you wrote her obituary . " A look of surprise crossed her face , then a faint smile . " I 've been here five years too , David . Tanya Rolfe and I were friends . We used to talk . " She looked away for a moment , remembering . " We did n't talk about her music much at all . I did n't know enough to talk about that . We talked about feelings , about loneliness  --  things like that . " " I did n't know that . I thought ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet and ran toward the passengers disembarking from the second hover . David stood , watching her run , watching her reach out to the big darkhaired man . They embraced and then they were coming toward him , Liss leading , tugging the big man along . He was smiling down at her . He wore the rank of office , but he was still too far away for David to make out the order of the colors . " David , " called Liss . " Look who 's here . " She looked up proudly at the stranger . He had dark good looks , this man , and a slight sardonic twist to his lips . He was well-muscled and looked no more than thirty . " David , this is Uncle Kurt . " She reached out and took David 's hand . " He 's not really my uncle , but I 've called him that since I could talk . " David stood dumbly by . His hand lay limp in Liss 's grasp . He felt like a child before this aggressively male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man was Kurt Kraus ? the Minister of Culture . And he was over two hundred years old . Kurt Kraus cupped Liss 's face in his hands and looked down at her . " You 've grown up , little one . " David felt his lips compress at the happy look on her face . The man smiled in his direction and reached out a hand to him . Reluctantly , David stretched out his hand  --  with the black and gold ring . At the sight of it , a look passed through Kurt 's eyes that David could n't read . " So you 're staying on at Renascence , " said the man . " David 's a musician , " Liss said proudly . " He was Tanya Rolfe 's protege . " The look again  --  what was it ? Then it was gone . " You must play for me sometime , David . " David nodded , not speaking . He 'd never play for him . Never . Not for this man who looked at Liss so familiarly . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help it ? he did n't really want to . " Your last name is Defour , is n't it ? " asked Kurt . He nodded stiffly . " You have immortal parents , then . But you 'll lose your crib name soon enough . It 's a fine thing to meet your parents and take their name . When you join the Society of Adults , you 'll see . It 's the biggest festival you can imagine . Food . Vinifountains . " He patted Liss on the shoulder . " You 'll miss out on all that , little one . When you 're born to mortals , there 's no surprise to the big day . " " I 'm not complaining . It was nice to be different and grow up with parents , " she said . " Besides , I do n't have to wait to see them . I 'm going home tomorrow  --  back to Hoffmeir . " Kurt 's brow quirked upward . His fingers pressed into her shoulder while a look , again unreadable , crossed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David and Liss sat apart . She sat with the larger group who had not made Final Decision ; he sat across a patch of green grass and blooming daisies with a smaller group who wore the black and gold rings .  | They sat in a large semicircle . In front of them stood a platform with a casket draped in white bearing a gold embroidered broken symbol of infinity and the words , " For Art . " Tanya Rolfe 's music began to play slowly . The sound swelled and grew from the parabolic shell that reflected the playing of the small orchestra . The blooming daisies began to move in a stately flow , directed by the hand of the master visiographer , Lindner . Kurt Kraus rose and began to speak in a slow deep voice , " We are here today to celebrate the immortality of the woman , Tanya Rolfe . The music she has created in her brief span has its own life . As long as humankind continues , so will these creations continue . As long as humankind has the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They buried her in a tiny plot of land overlooking the lake and the mountains beyond . There were nine others there . On the next morning , before the sun was high , David slipped out of his cabin and went to the small graveyard . He carried his flute with him , nothing else . He sat for a long time under the spreading shade of an oak tree and played . He played the music she 'd written for him when he first came to Renascence : " David 's Song . " He played until the hover , bearing Liss away from Renascence forever , was a tiny dot in the distance .  | The matron wore the dark green uniform of the Colony Police . She was pudgy , and her clothes fit poorly . Her snug tunic rode in folds around her thick waist and struggled over wide hips . She 's not very bright , thought Liss McNabb . Maybe she could get away from her  --  when the right moment came . The thought of escape had been near the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day before . It had stayed in her mind as she huddled in her locked compartment on the skiptor ; and now , as she sat under the watchful stare of the matron while the Arrow sped them toward Vesta Central , the thought was paramount . Liss changed her position slightly . The Arrow seat was uncomfortable . She felt the stares of the other passengers and self-consciously she crossed her arms in her lap in an attempt to hide her swelling belly . It was getting bigger every day  --  too big to deny anymore . At least she was n't nauseated now . She had been able to get rid of the little cylinder of Neutravert that had been her constant ally since she had come home from Renascence . A man across the aisle stared boldly at her . She glared back . Damn them all . Uneasily , she was aware of others looking at her . She might as well be wearing a sign with bright letters yelling : No Certificate UNAUTHORIZED PREGNANCY  | Well , they were n't going to take it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was sick of their logic . Sick of their arguments that had turned quickly to threats . She was n't going to be afraid of them  --  or their prisons . The matron was uncommunicative , and that suited her just fine . She looked away from her and from the bold-faced man and pretended to examine the Vestan landscape as it rolled away beneath her . She sat like this , staring into the dimming Dayglow until the Arrow came to a stop in Central City . " Off here , " said the matron . Liss stared ahead in dismay . Scarcely two blocks ahead stood the squat Corrections Center . Once they 'd locked her in there , she 'd never get out . Halfway there was the highspeed zont hub that connected several levels of Vesta . If she could divert the matron long enough , maybe she could get away . They walked in silence until they came abreast of the hub . Suddenly , Liss grabbed her belly and hunched over . She began to moan . " What is it ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed the zont railing with one hand and moaned louder . She crouched by the railing . " What 's wrong ? What is it ? " " The baby , " she grunted through clenched teeth . " I think I 'm losing the baby . " " Here ? " The woman stared at Liss , bewilderment on her face . " Hurry then . It 's not much farther . " In reply , Liss hunched over the rail and redoubled her moans . " Oh-o-oh ! Get help . Quick ! " Hands clutching together in distress , the matron looked uncertainly at the passers-by . " Hurry ! " said Liss with a tremulous whimper . " Oh help , before it comes . " The matron turned and called , " Help . " The instant the woman 's back was to her , Liss leaped over the rail to the downward angling zont track below . She was running the moment her feet touched , running , diving , down the zont toward the next level .  | At the foot , she stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the moving zont past a series of storage buildings . Then she turned again onto a narrow sideway , running a zigzagging path until she could run no longer . She darted into a loading ramp and crouched in the shadows . Panting , she took huge sucking gasps of air . Her leg muscles trembled , and her heart throbbed in her ears . She waited there until Dayglow was gone and the night of Vesta had activated the lights along the streets of the asteroid . Only then did she come out to walk cautiously along the dim sideways . She had no idea where she would go or what she would do next . She had thought no further than the escape itself . And when she did consider it , the realization came that there was truly no way out . Vesta was large , but not that large . How would she hide ? Where ? She looked very young , very uncertain , as she walked among the hulking storehouses . No one else was near  --  it was a place for Dayglow activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked around often with round blue eyes that now and then filled with moisture . She was very tired and very hungry . The phenomenon known as the Labyrinth crept in the wake of exhausted mine shafts . As each passage was abandoned by the robo-crushers and the men who tended them , it slowly filled with the scents of musk and sweat . The smoke from smoldering hallucinogenic oils clung to the rock of its walls , undissipated by the poor ventilation of the winding corridors . The throb of drums and bright writhing holos mingled with the scents and the smoke of the Labyrinth , luring the bored and disillusioned of the belt to its depths . Liss stared at the dimly lit storehouses . They were full of food  --  and there was no way she could get to any of it . She sank exhausted at the edge of a building and leaned against it . Her stomach rumbled , and she felt the edge of hunger turn toward nausea . Maybe she could sleep . Maybe she could  | try and forget about the awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought her to her feet . She stared toward the sound , eyes straining against the darkness . In the narrow alleyway between two storehouses a small shadow moved , stopped , then moved again . A rat ! Its naked tail coiled just within a small pool of light . Rats had traveled to space early on , stowaways in man 's food and supplies . The survivors had bred and multiplied until it was estimated that there were more rats than colonists now . Most of them were around the storehouses , she thought . She began to walk again . She came to the Mining Operations and wandered among the big crushers and cutters , stumbling once in the near darkness over a projecting metal beam . Involuntary tears stung her eyes as she rubbed her bruised shin . Eventually she came to a large mine opening . A single patch of light illuminated it . The opening was cavelike and roughly fifteen meters square . Near the opening , within the small lighted area , stood a small open shed . Just inside hung several rows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liss found a pair of goggles and reached for them , hoping they were like the ones she had played with when she was little . She put them on . Pale shadowless light came into her eyes . The mine opening stretched ahead , gray walls meeting lighter gray dust-covered floor . She walked into the shaft . She knew she could n't stay here , knew they would find her by morning . And if they did n't see her first , she could be crushed by machine or incinerated by laser cutter . Yet she moved on , passing by a series of downward-leading square holes next to the walls of the mine . She peered into one . It was a straight drop , and she could n't see the bottom . Shivering , she ventured on and looked in the next . It was the same . She walked on until she came to the next series . This time , she spotted handholds in one of them . She looked down over the edge . The rock shaft ended about ten meters below . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choice ? she asked herself .  | She grasped the handhold , testing it . When it held firm , she swung a foot into a toehold and began to climb down . It was farther than she thought to the bottom . Halfway down , she felt her legs tremble . A cramp was starting in her left calf . She clung to the handhold and looked around her . Even with the goggles , the shaft was dim . It seemed narrower than she had thought at first . It seemed to be closing in . At the first jitters of claustrophobia , she began moving downward again . She ran out of holds when her feet were nearly four meters from the bottom , but as she clung to the last hold and looked around , she realized that she seemed to be in one end of a narrow rock corridor . It was brighter here , too bright for the goggles . With one hand she pushed them up on her forehead and looked around . Dim light diffused into the tunnel . The air was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to the left . She looked at the floor below . It looked uncompromisingly hard , and much farther away than she felt comfortable about even in the low gravity . Her arms ached , and the muscles in her calf were beginning to twitch again . She pressed her belly against the rock of the shaft . Her knuckles showed white on the handholds . Sweat began to bead her forehead , causing the goggles to begin to slide . She was too tired to climb up again . She could n't . She 'd have to jump . She eased her toes to the edge of their foothold and extending her arms dropped into a squatting position . Her hands , slimed with sweat , lost traction on the metal holds . She had to jump before she fell . She jumped , legs bent , fell awkwardly , and landed with one foot turned under . She gasped at the hot agony in her foot and ankle , and thrusting her head back , she strained against the pain . She closed her eyes and knotted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy throb . Nothing was left but hopelessness . " Come with me , " said a voice like velvet . Her eyes flew open ; her heart lodged in her throat . ' There was no one in the corridor .  | " Come with me , " the voice repeated . She looked around wildly . Suddenly , overhead a light flickered , winked , swirled like blue gauze , and then extended itself into a shape  --  a cross . " Come with me . . . A better life . . . Come with me ... " The cross began to blaze with a cold white light . " Silver T . . . " it whispered . " Silver T .... " The holo swirled over her head . " Come with me . " As it spoke , it shimmered , dissolved and spread its gauzy net toward her . She shrank against the rock wall . The holo regrouped into the cross . " Come with me . . . A better life . . . Come with me ... " The bolo fluttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the empty passage ahead . Where was she ? Worse , who was out there ? She managed to get to her feet . Her ankle was beginning to swell badly , but she did n't think it was broken . When she gingerly tried to put her weight on it , pain stabbed and ran up to her knee . But if she ignored the worst of it , she found she could hobble a little . She looked around once more . There were two choices . She could stay in this dead-end corridor with no place to hide and nothing to eat or drink , or she could see what lay at the end of the passage . Leaning against the rough wall , she began to make her painful way down the corridor . When she reached the end , she peeped cautiously around . The passage led on , angling to the right and slightly downhill . No one was there . The going was rougher now as she picked her way over the uneven floor . Once , she slipped on a greasy layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ankle took her breath away . She leaned against the wall for support and felt the sweat grow on her forehead and trickle down her face . The blue light fluttered into the corridor again . She stared at it , blinking as it whispered and cajoled . " . . . A better life . . . " it promised as it swooped and turned and blazed its cross-shape at her . " . . . Silver T . . . " and fluttered away once again . Smells and sounds began to filter into the passage . Just ahead , the corridor turned again sharply to the right . She  | slowly thrust her head around the wall . Blood-red disembodied eyes stared into hers . She gasped and shrank back . Only a holo , she told herself firmly . She heard a cooing laugh and looked again . A chubby naked baby boy floated in the passage . He laughed and held out his arms to her . And as he laughed , his penis grew giant and erect and the soft baby lines of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rippled , winked out . A shiver traced its way up her spine . She had never heard of the Labyrinth . If anyone had told her , she would have scoffed in disbelief . The corridor she had come to was wide , curving out of sight a few meters further on . The sounds and the smells were growing more distinct . Just across from her in the wall near the floor , a square hole yawned . The opening was about a meter wide . Making sure no one was in sight , she hobbled across and looked inside . It was totally dark in there . She pulled the goggles down over her eyes . With them on , the hole became the opening to a tunnel of rock lasered to a glasslike smoothness . Suddenly , she realized that the noise level around the bend of the corridor had increased . She could hear individual voices . She could n't let them find her . Heart beating fast , wincing from the pain in her ankle , she backed into the tunnel . She eased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Its screech echoed inside the tunnel . And there was another noise too  --  footsteps  --  and they were coming closer . Instinctively , she backed further into the tunnel . The moment she did , she felt the passage dip abruptly . Gasping , she began to slide . She slid rapidly , turning toward the right once . Near the bottom the chute leveled , slowing her descent . She landed in back of a large , dim room hewn from rock . With a start , she realized that it was full of people  --  dozens of people  --  staring toward something in the center of the room . Her heart pressed and pounded in her throat . Then , suddenly , she realized that no one had noticed her . She drew back against the wall , listening to the drone of indistinguish- able voices , seeing the gray shapes that swayed in rhythmic motion from side to side . Gray against gray , they moved as if they were one body . Gray against gray . Of course ! She pulled the goggles from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness . No wonder they had n't seen her . There was no light except at the center of the room . There , a shallow metal dish a meter across flickered with bluish flame . Its heavy scent gradually crept across the room toward her , bearing a smell not unlike the honeysuckle of Renascence  --  but something else too  --  beneath the sweet smell was an underlay , a scent she dimly remembered . What was it ? She eased herself back in the opening of the chute and watched . The scent tickled her mind with hints of fairy tale and nightmare . Why ? Then she remembered . She had been only eight or nine when the big boy offered it to her . He had lighted the tiny shallow spoon of oil and wafted it under her nose . And he had laughed . Laughed as she cried and flinched when the trolls came into her head  --  and the fearful witch riding a giant green dragon with flame for breath that flickered over her hair and set it agonizingly aflame . He had laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , she realized that the scent was faint . Faint , but definite . She pulled the goggles over her eyes again and looked around . The room played its drama in shades of gray against ash . The people sat in a concentric circle around the smouldering dish . They sat on the floor with outstretched arms linked , and their upper bodies swayed in a slow , a rhythmic ellipse . And as she watched them , she realized that they were children . The oldest was probably no more than fourteen ; the youngest only ten or so . Something flared in the center of the smoking dish . The light nearly blinded her . She snatched the goggles away . When her eyes adjusted , she saw a fountain of blue flame playing above the dish , leaping toward the high ceiling , splashing its cold fire over the room , over the staring children . The background hum grew louder and sorted itself into a litany  --  a sibilant hiss , then a whispered murmur stroked her ears : " S'sss . . . fur'rrr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it mean ?  | Her head began to ache as the sound , as the insinuating scent , as the flame that burned now blue , now white , played against her senses . The blue flame spun in an arc above the center of the dish , its whispered circle changing now to a disc , and then a sphere . The colors shifted in the globe , blue swirling into white , and as it hung and slowly turned , she saw the pattern ? Earth . Then just above the moving globe , a silver cross appeared and drove its heavy shaft straight through the axis of the sphere . The oceans of the Earth splashed out in liquid blue and then the body of the globe broke up and crumbled into dust . " Obey . . . Obey ... " She heard them say it then and thought she saw , for just a flashing moment , a confusing cherub-smile atop the cross . " Obey . . . Obey ... " The children moved as one thing in the room . " Rewards forever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men came . They brought a boy between them  --  a boy with glazing eyes and vacant face  --  a boy they handled like a doll . They stood him up against a cross and tied him there . She watched with burning eyes and fogging mind . What were they doing to him ? What ? And why ? And when the two men moved away , she saw the boy 's head flopping on a limber neck that seemed awry . They raised him on the cross . " From death  --  reward . " She stared as a projection grew  --  the boy 's face , smiling down . " From death  --  reward . " She stared . " Oh God ! His neck . He 's killed . Oh God ! " She screamed and screamed and screamed without knowing that she was the only one who did .  | The lines of Kurt Kraus 's face were drawn heavy with anger . " What happened to her ? " Deputy Minister Silvio Tarantino raised both hands , palm down , as if to smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl ran away from the matron , she hid in an area near the central zontilator hub . Some of our children are attracted to the hub . It 's exciting for them to play there . Of course , we forbid it , but that does tend to make it more enticing , does n't it ? " He smiled ruefully and shook his head . " The boy was running on top of the upper railing . He lost his balance and fell . Broken neck . He died instantly . " The McNabb girl saw it all . She tried to run to him and she fell too . She was hysterical when she was found . I 'm told her hysteria was intensified due to the drugs . " " Drugs ? " There was something about the man Kurt needed to remember , something buried in a clot of old memories . Something ... . " She had taken an hallucinogenic some time before . " Kurt narrowed his eyes . " I never knew her to take drugs . " " She was distraught . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said smoothly . " There are witnesses , of course , if you 'd care to talk with them . " " I 'm sure there are , " he said shortly . There was something about the man that set Kurt on guard . It was his manner . He was too glib , too easy with a phrase , too ingenuous ? the mark of either an exceptionally honest man , or a profes- sional liar . Kurt leveled a stare at Tarantino . He did n't doubt his professionalism for a moment . " How is she now ? " The man met his look with an open , almost cherubic gaze , yet the birthmark at the angle of his jaw ticked with the clenching and unclenching of his jaw . " Doing well , I understand . They 've given her something to help her sleep . " " And her baby ? " " Still here . We canceled the procedure when we learned of your , uh , interest in the matter . " Even the subtly inserted pause seemed calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , should the Minister of Culture be so interested in a schoolgirl ? Kurt stood up abruptly . " I want to see her . " " Of course , " said the little man . Acting on impulse , Kurt made a short detour on his way to Liss . Entering Communications Control , he commandeered a terminal in the name of the Ministry . The soft voice of the communicator spoke in his ear : " How can we assist you , Mr. Kraus ? " " Request bio-sketch , Silvio Tarantino , Deputy Minister , Vesta . " He stared at the information , hoping to jog loose the nagging scrap of memory : TARANTINO , SILVIO ANTHONY : Born M-G 17 , New Providence Island , Consolidated Bahamian Sector , Earth . Father : Victor Luis Tarantino , deceased M-G 29 . Mother : Caterina " Kitty " Theresa Martez Tarantino , deceased M-G 57 . Dormitory : Victoria , N.P. M-G r7-35 . Studies : Acad. of the Azores M-G 35 ? 39 ? Spec . Studies WorldCo ComSchool M-G 39-41 . Immigrated Vesta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sketch again . Nothing at all familiar . And yet he could n't shake the feeling that there was something very wrong here .  | " Complete bio , Tarantino , Silvio Anthony , " he said . When the communicator complied , he studied it carefully . To his disgust , he learned nothing . Liss was sleeping when Kurt walked into her room . She lay curled on her side with her arms folded over her face , palm out , as if to ward off a blow . When he walked across the room , she stirred and muttered and then lay quiet . He sat by her bedside and looked at her . Her face was dirty and streaked with dried tears . She looked very young and very vulnerable . The thin bedcover followed the convex line of her belly . It had been over four months  --  four months since she had left Renascence . And the boy who was responsible did n't even know . She moaned and pressed her lips together . Stubborn , thought Kurt , stubborn even in her sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done . She needs to be spanked , he thought agressively . He could still see the anguish in her parents ' faces when they told him . And Sean ... Sean had tried to be light about it , even making a feeble joke or two , but the concern he felt for this girl who carried his genes after four generations , the love he felt had etched his face with lines of worry and shadowed his eyes . And they were the only family he had  --  his adopted little brother Sean , and this girl , and her parents . Everyone else was dead long ago . " Stubborn little girl , " he said softly . She did n't know the cost . Liss turned and whimpered in her sleep . She flung her hands away from her face . Her eyes were open , staring at nothing . " Oh no . Oh , God ! Awful , awful , awful ? " She began to scream . He was at her side in a moment , holding her , petting her , talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . All right . There , there , " until she grew quiet . Then she blinked and looked at him as if he had not been there until now . Surprise widened her eyes . " Uncle Kurt ? Oh , it was awful . So awful ? " She struggled to a sitting position . He took her hand between his . " What was awful ? What happened to you ? "  | She looked at him thoughtfully , then stared at her knees . When she looked back at him , puzzlement spread over her face . " I do n't remember , Uncle Kurt . I do n't remember at all . " He looked at her strangely . Then he began to talk of other things , inconsequential things , until she said , " You came to get me out of trouble , did n't you ? " " I came to do what I could do . " " I knew you 'd understand , " she said , clasping his hand . " I knew you would . " " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that you managed to acquire an illegal pregnancy as a going-away present from a young Renascence musician . I understand that you have parceled a very large ration of grief on your family and yourself . And I understand that you completely failed to cooperate with the Population authorities . " " They wanted to take my baby . " " And so they will . And after they do that , they will confine you in a Vestan prison . Is that what you want ? " She caught her lower lip between her teeth and looked at him for a long time before she said , " But you can help me , Uncle Kurt . " " And you 're counting on that . " " I guess I am . " The corner of his lip quirked in a smile devoid of humor . " I suppose I should be flattered at the simple belief you have in my omnipotence . " Alarm darted across her face . " You can , ca n't you ? " He looked away for a moment . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sake of this discussion , let 's consider that there may be something I can do . " A look of relief . " Oh , I knew it . " He caught her hands . " Why did you do it , Liss ? You 're not stupid . You knew what you were doing . " " I had to . " " Had to ? " " Yes . " She pulled her hands away and wrapped them around her knees . " Because of David . " " You love him ? "  | " Yes . But that 's not why . Not all of it . " " Why , then ? " " Because he 's staying at Renascence . Because he 's going to live and die there . He 'll never marry , have children , even though he can . And all of him should n't die , Uncle Kurt . At least , that 's the way I see it . " So that was the reason . She was offering this boy a kind of immortality  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at the ceiling , partly to think , partly to hide the look of pain he felt creep over his face and tug at the corners of his mouth . He had been afraid that this might be her reason ; and when he heard it , he knew there would be no changing her mind . He remembered the two of them standing on the hillside at Renascence when he had come for Tanya Rolfe 's funeral . Did she carry the germ of David 's child then ? He thought of the pain in the boy 's face when he looked at her and took her hand in his , twining his long fingers through hers . But he wore a ring , and she did n't . He wore a gold ring with the broken symbol of infinity that caught in the sunlight and glinted like the gold in Liss 's hair . Kurt dropped his eyes to hers , " Will you give up the baby ? " " No . " " Your offense is against Population . The Minister of Population does not take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get him to agree . You could make a b ? " She stopped at the look on his face . " You were going to suggest that I bargain with Population ? make a trade . Well , I have , Liss , " he said slowly . " I have . " She hugged him , " Oh thank you . I knew you could help . " " You have n't heard the terms . " Her eyebrows raised in a question . " I can offer you a term-contract of marriage . " " With David ? " " No . David is a minor without rights . Your contract will be with me . Legally binding for twenty years . " A smile twitched at the corner of her mouth . " But I 've always called you uncle . Is n't that incestuous ? " She began to giggle and then to laugh until lines crinkled the corners of her  | eyes and tears filled them . " I 'm sixteen , " she whooped , " and I 'm going to marry an older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but watching her laugh proved infectious . He grinned at her and gave her a paternal kiss on the forehead , which served to increase her giggles . It was n't until after she sank back exhausted on the bed and dozed off that the doubts came flooding back . Ndebele had been most polite , most considerate when Kurt had outlined Liss 's problem to him . The Minister of Population had offered to be most cooperative about issuing a permit and a term-contract license . " And , of course , " he had said , " Population would expect certain concessions from Culture . There was the troublesome matter of the mentally defective children . Now , if Renascence would accept these children .... " And he had said  --  God help him  --  he had said , " Yes . " He stared at the girl as she turned and muttered in her sleep and threw her arms over her face and cried out , " Awful , awful , awful . Oh God ! Awful .... "  | page deleted  |  | The starship hung in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun glinted on the silver ellipse that would carry thirty thousand people on her maiden voyage . The ship was nearly finished , with only the final fittings left for the technicians who swarmed her hull like sperm and breached her virgin depths . She bore the name ARIES on her hull and on her bridge . She carried the Ramirez star drive in her bowels . She bore the name Aries , but they called her " the Ram . " They entered the ship through the starboard bay and debarked through a pressurized tunnel that led to a large sublif . " Feels like Earth 's gravity , " said Kurt Kraus . " Yes , " answered Jacoby , " but only in the outer levels . The Ram is spinning on her longitudinal axis . The pull decreases as we move inboard . " Jacoby punched a code , and they began to move . " You 'll find Central Habitat 's gravity more like Vesta 's . I think you 'll be impressed with Central Hab , " said the foreman with obvious pride . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped out into what seemed to be a large public building . " This way , " said Jacoby . Kurt followed the man to a large landscaped square with a central fountain . He looked around at the sight in amazement . He stood in a village studded with low buildings interspersed with shrubbery and trees . A zont hub ringed the square and  | splayed out in all directions . In the distance along the zont lines , Kurt could see more low buildings amid green fields and young trees . The horizon curved upward in the distance . He felt as if he stood at the bottom of a huge basin . Overhead an irregular blue " sky , " reflecting the blue rooftops below it and ringed with green , startled him . The foreman grinned . " Sky Lake , " he said . " Incredible effect is n't it ? " He swung his arm overhead , pointing toward the left of the blue . " Up there is the Park  --  with a capital P. Although we have recreational parks in this hemi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go  --  a different place . " Kurt nodded . For thirty thousand people enclosed in a space-going egg some twenty kilometers across , it was essential that they have diversion  --  someplace different to see , someplace different to be . " The plan is to let over half of it grow wild and to allow only a limited number on the trails at a given time . Of course , it 's not very wild yet . " He grinned . " The trees and shrubs are young , but the soil 's good . And in a subtropical climate , trees grow fast . Gumbo limbo and mahogany make up the bulk of them . " He swung his arm in an arc over his head and pointed to the right of Sky Lake . " Up there is the place you 'll want to see  --  New Renascence . The best way to get there is to go back one level and take the Hemichute . " Kurt followed Jacoby through the maze of sublifs and passageways that led to the Hemichute . Everywhere he looked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers knew Jacoby and called him by name . They reserved curious stares , some bordering on insolence , for Kurt . He took a seat in the Hemi beside Jacoby . As the car accelerated , he considered the man who sat next to him . Although Jacoby had spent years on Earth , he had been born on Vesta and so was acceptable to the colony crews who built the Ram . Jacoby 's ability was one of the few things the colonists and the Earthers agreed on , thought Kurt . The Ram had failed to create the camaraderie the Ministry had hoped for . The tension between the colonies and Earth had grown .  | Needed ore shipments were consistently delayed due to " unavoidable accident . " Mislabeled cargo was time and again shunted to the wrong destination , there to be buried under Vestan red tape . When the Ministry looked into the matter , its investigators found themselves in the worst accommodations in the belt . They were beset with transportation " breakdowns , " " malfunctioning computers , " and bland-faced colonists with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their beds lumpy and their food cold . They did not doubt for a moment that the treatment they received was deliberate , and when they complained to the Deputy Minister 's office , they were met with polite but blank stares and an increasing string of " unfortunate accidents . " As a result , the Minister of Commerce was coming that day to Vesta to head a serious investigation . Other visitors from Earth had not fared much better than the Ministry envoys . Lately there had been a number of thefts and physical attacks . Each event taken separately could be , and was , explained facilely by the Deputy Minister 's office . Taken cumulatively , the pattern was obvious . Jacoby had to be aware of it . Kurt asked him so  --  directly . He got a surprisingly direct answer . " You 're right . When I was a boy , we always felt mildly contemptuous of Earthers , but it was always tempered with good humor  --  you know , the Earther-joke mental set . " He paused , staring outside the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ram 's periphery . " I 've been away a long time . When I came back , I could feel the difference at once . The contempt is still there , but the humor 's gone now . " " Do you know why ? " Jacoby shook his head . " I try to stay out of it . I consider myself to be apolitical . " Kurt pressed him . " But you 've worked directly with these men . You must have your own ideas about what 's happening . " Ideas do n't count for much when the ground under your feet begins to move . "  | " What do you mean ? " " I was in an avalanche once , in the Andes . It begins small , you know . If you stand around wondering how it began , you 'll earn a quick , cold grave . The thing to do is get out of the way . " Kurt felt the car decelerate . When it stopped , the two men got out . In a few minutes they stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sky Lake . Far overhead , the buildings of the village clustered . Maybe later , thought Kurt . Later , when the trees have grown maybe it will be more like an Earth place . Maybe even now , at night . He tried to imagine darkness in this place , at the shore of this shallow lake . Would the lights of the village look like stars overhead ? He looked at the foreman , " What are your plans when you 're finished here ? " " I 'm going with her , " said Jacoby . " I 'm going with the Ram . " Kurt returned to Vesta by shuttle . When he reached the Ministry guest quarters , the lobby was clogged with police and media personnel . He found himself staring into a three-vee camera , " Do you have any comment , Citizen Kraus , concerning the tragedy ? " He pushed man and camera aside with a quick " no comment , " and turned to an aide . " Walk with me , " he said in a low voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd . " What happened ? " " The Minister of Commerce , " said the aide in a whisper . " He went up to rest before his meeting with Silvio Tarantino . When he did n't return , they checked . He 's dead . Murdered . His neck was broken . " Kurt stared at the man . Not murdered , he thought . Assassinated . There was a difference  --  a world of difference . Liss 's hand brushed lightly over his neck , and he felt a pleasing prickle shiver over his nape . He looked at her . Her hair was caught in the red glow of the sun sinking into the Gulf as it sent its last rays over the little Florida island . " You were staring at the water as if you were never going  | to see it again , " she said . Her eyes crinkled at the edges in amusement . " I 've heard of eyes drinking it in , ' but I 've never seen such a graphic example . I thought the tide was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at her thoughtfully . Pretty little girl . Friend . The sun washed her skin with pink and glowed along the curving lines of her body . A breeze caught her hair , lifting it in little strands that rode the wind like pale curling feathers . He felt a hot desire for her go through him like an electric shock . He shook his head once , as if to clear it , and strode across the narrow beach into the cool water . He swam out to a sandbar where small breakers rolled . The sand felt smooth under his feet , and he stood precariously balanced in the surf . Then he turned toward the shore and looked at her again . She was on her knees , running her hands through a tide pool , turning rosy shells over and holding them to the light . She was a child . There were centuries between them  --  a gulf greater than this one that washed between the shores of Florida and Mexico . He balanced between , the breakers and the turning tide . Small particles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small fish swam against his leg , a momentary dark streak that vanished in the surf . He began to swim . Buoyant in the salty water , he swam a hundred meters to a jetty that sent small whirlpools around its barnacle-rough pilings . He hung on , riding the buffeting of the water , then releasing his grip , swam again until , fatigued , he waded toward the shore , emerging with the water running from him in salty rivers . Liss handed him a thick towel , warm from the sand . " Did you swim up an appetite ? " He toweled dry and then , in the last light of the dying sunset , examined the shells she had collected , running his thumb over each smooth inner surface . Listening to the drum of the low waves , feeling the foam run over his feet and wash away again , he thought of another shore . He thought of a shallow lake in a starship called the Ram , a silent lake whose waters would never feel the pull of the moon or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you , " Gerstein had told him . " Someone to lead the voyage . " To leave Earth . To leave this sun forever . To travel in a hurtling cocoon toward other suns . And some day  --  perhaps  --  to lay a footprint on another shore . " Hungry ? " she asked again . He looked up . " Thank you for meeting me here , Liss . " " Of course , " she said . They ate their dinner on a wide veranda . Insects beat against its invisible walls , fell back , flew again toward the light of the candles on their table . The Ministry house squatted on a low dune amid broad sea grapes and hibiscus bushes that closed their red flowers against the night . Below the dune , across the little beach , the dark tide rolled and froth showed white in the moonlight . They ate coquina soup and avocado salad and broiled snapper from the Gulf and sipped a chilled white wine with a flinty taste to it . They praised the wine and the fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark water , at the foaming spray that leaped at the moon as he watched her . Little friend , he thought , you have lines of worry on your face . Aloud , he said , " Have your studies gone well ? Your work ? " The lines smoothed away . She smiled , " I 'm progressing . The ancient craft of journalism suits me , I guess . And you ? And your work ? " " It goes on . " He reached across the table and took her hand . It was warm in his . He turned it over and held it , palm up , and stared into it . She laughed . " Are you going to tell my fortune ? " " I believe I will , " he said . He traced a line on her palm . " Here  --  a long life . A very long life . " " Amazing , " she said . " What else do you see ? " " Here " ? he touched again ? " I see a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked away . " And here , I see a legal contract , to a much older man . " She looked back at him then , an eyebrow tilting quizzically . " And here I see diverging paths . " He began to speak more  | rapidly now , holding her hand lightly in his . " I see other interests , here , for you . Other people . Young men . You should try that , you know . " Her hand felt cold in his . She pulled it away . " Maybe you 're right . Maybe I will . " He had expected it , asked for it . Why did he feel an emptiness when she agreed ? She stood up in a few minutes . " I 'm tired . I think I 'll go to bed . " He spread his hands on the table , studying them , making no move to get up . " I suppose you 'll be leaving in the morning . " " I suppose I will , " she said . " Goodnight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bed and heard her move on her bed , lie still and move again . And then he heard a catching , sobbing sound . A pause , and then again . He sat on the side of his bed and clutched his knees , and when the sound went on , he got up and went to her room . The door was unlocked . He pushed it open and went to her . The room was dark with only the light of the moon to see by . He touched her shoulder . " What , Liss ? What is it ? " Her face was buried in her hands . He sat by her and gently pulled her hands away . Her tears were glistening tracks . " What is it ? " he asked again . " N-nothing . " But she began to sob . Finally she lay quiet , and then she said , " People should have someone . Someone who matters . " He stroked her hair . " I know . " " I do n't have anybody . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I want my baby , Kurt . I do n't want her to be in a dorm . I want her . I want Alani . " She began to cry again . He held her as if she were a little girl . He held her and patted her until the moon was gone and she slept . He held her and listened as the surf boomed on the dark beach .  | The salt wind whipped David 's hair into his eyes . He stood on a narrow beach and squinted out over the sparkling water . The surf boomed and echoed , roiling up the beach to send its chilly foam over his feet , then running back to sea . He reached into his pack and took out a tiny recorder . Checking its meters , he set dials and pushed buttons automatically . The little machine had almost become part of him ? an electronic extension of David Defour . He had used it nearly every day for the two years since Final Decision . The infrasonic tracing blipping its way across a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A curved line on the horizon became a disc , then became a small two-seater hover . It came in fast , skimming the waves like a flat stone skipping over a pond . It slowed when it was nearly overhead , then all forward movement stopped and it dropped gently to the sandy beach . The hatch opened , and the biggest man David had ever seen got out . His name was Jonathan Long . Startled , David stared at the man . Jonathan was huge in stature , like a broad and blowing great whale . Like the whales that he felt kin to , his great bulk was cased in blubber , rolling tides of flesh and blubber . And from the center of that being shone a soul of gentle brightness , through dark eyes that radiated warmth . His voice boomed like storm surf . " Hello , David . " The sound washed over him . The whale man , he  | thought . He 's like them . He really is . The wet sand beneath his heels melted away and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see you 're ready , " said Jonathan . " Let 's go . " David nodded and followed the giant man to the hover . In a minute , they rose straight up no more than five meters and headed out toward open water . Jonathan handled the controls with a delicacy David would n't have believed possible if he had n't seen it for himself . The man 's bulging fingers touched a lever ; the craft banked suddenly and changed direction . David stared at the man 's hands . He wore no ring . Jonathan caught the look and laughed , " This has n't been on my hand for the last seventy or so kilos . " He touched his shirt front and pulled out the black and gold ring that dangled from a chain around his neck . " My fingers got too big for it . Even the little finger . So , now tell me , " he boomed , " what brings about your interest in whales ? " " I 'm a musician ? " David began . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , son , I 'm afraid it 's all been done . Long ago . " " No , it has n't . Not what I 'm doing . " Jonathan gave him a quick look . " And what 's that ? " " I 'll show you . " David rummaged in his pack and pulled out the recorder . He fitted it with a small silver disc and switched it on . The haunting song of the humpback whale began . As it ended , another began , similar , but definitely changed . " You see , it 's different . " " Of course it 's different . Whales are intelligent . Inventive . Their song is proof of that . " " Maybe that 's why nobody bothered to look any farther . I want you to hear something else . " He slipped another disc into the little machine . It was lower pitched and repetitive , but otherwise similar to the creaking notes of the first song . " Now , listen . " David adjusted the machine and played the disc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identical with parts of the first song , but other parts  --  the high pinging notes , the drawn-out melodic squeals  --  were missing . " Do you know what that is ? "  | " One track of a multi-track whale song recording , " said Jonathan . " I think so , too , " said David , " only there were n't any whales within hundreds of miles when this was recorded . " Jonathan did n't speak for a moment . They skimmed over the open water with the waves leaping up from below , nearly touching the hover . Spray misted the plexishield . As soon as the washers wiped it away , another coating sprayed over the surface . Finally , the man said , " All right , David . You have my curiosity aroused . " David grinned . " I think part of the whale 's song is altered infrasound . That 's what that last tape was  --  the sound of the rocks of their breeding ground  --  little quivers of the tectonic plates . I 've been collecting these tapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transpose it up several octaves . I think they use it to tell each other how to find food . " Jonathan blew a skeptical breath through pursed lips . " Not possible . They use echolocation for that . Not infrasound at all . Ultrasonics . " " Yes . To locate plankton layers and so on . But how do the other whales know where that plankton is ? How do they know , for that matter , how to navigate through thousands of miles of open ocean ? " Jonathan stared at him , and then a slow grin spread over his massive face . " Sort of a ping , ping ' plankton 's here between these creak , creak ' rocks . Is that what you 're saying ? " " Close . Every mountain and trench in the sea makes a different infrasound . I think whales imitate the sound to describe the place . " David laughed , " Something like ? ' they 're serving a good meal back at the grunt-groan . Turn left at the creak . ' They could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , if one whale is feeding , another could spot him with ultrasound , " Jonathan began . " But , what about later ? After that first whale left the area ? How else could he give the other whales the message ? I think it must be infrasound language . What do you think ? " he asked Jonathan . " You 're the expert . " " Me ? " Jonathan 's hands sat lightly on the controls . " I 'm  | not an expert , David . I 'm a bum . A whale bum . You do n't know what that means , do you  --  that term ? It 's archaic for drone . " His eyes widened , " You have to be the expert . " " Have to be ? I do n't have to be anything , David . The government sees to that . " He touched the chain at his neck . " With this ring , I can have anything I want  --  all I have to do is die for it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't know what to say . " Oh , I started off with big plans , big hopes , " said Jonathan . " But , somehow I got dislodged from those plans after my Final Decision . I was going to be a biologist . Study those big blubbers out there . " A rueful smile slipped across his face . " I 'm not sure what happened . Depression , I guess . I began to doubt . I 'd chosen to die for science . Trouble is , for me it died first . " " So you are n't  --  I mean , you do n't ? " " I chase whales , David . All over the world . I have n't had an original thought in twenty years . " He slid the hover around in a banking turn . David felt his stomach lurch . " But now , " said Jonathan . " Tell me about yourself . How are you going to use this infrasound in your music ? " He felt sick . He did n't know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , and he felt hot shame . At least Jonathan was honest . Honest enough to admit what he had n't admitted to himself . What he had n't dared to admit . Now he could n't lie to himself any longer . Gathering infrasound tapes was an excuse for not working  --  for not being able to work . He had n't written an original note of music since Final Decision two years ago . Mercifully , Jonathan 's voice boomed through his thoughts . " She blows , David . She blows . "  | It was after hours . Colonel Gunnar Holst relaxed in the Common Room of the GF Satellite , which hung in stable orbit at LeGrange Point 5 . He sipped a beer . It was from the latest batch , and it was colder than he liked . He sipped the beer , warming it in his hands , and watched the latest three-vee drama unfold . He ignored the striking beauty of the full Earth outside the curving viewport of the Common Room . The sight failed to stir him anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was feeling nostalgic . He had been a member of the elite Guardian Force for nearly thirty years now , and there were few new scenic wonders left for him to contemplate from that curving piece of glass . Not that he was a contemplative man . His view could be stated in just a few words : Might Makes Right , and Orders Over All . His orders , when they came , would come from Earth . His superiors were the combined Ministry of WorldCo . Only the combined Ministry had the authority to order the unleashing of the L-5 warheads by the Guardian Force . In the meantime he waited and held the high ground . He ran a free hand over his bullet head and clutched the beer with the other . The drama was a series they had been getting from Vesta . He watched as the little three-dimensional figures played out their roles . It was a story about a group of brave people who had colonized a distant planet and were victimized by a ruthless and corrupt Federation . One of the leading characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or being a puppet of the government .  | The little holo figure stood bravely before the depraved Federation man . He knew he was going to die , and he faced it bravely saying , " It is a far , far better thing I do than I have ever done before . . . " A tiny flash of a deadly smazer , then a sizzling sound , and the little man was gone . Hoist nodded approvingly . A show like that made a man think . He wondered what it would be like to die for an ideal . Somehow he knew that to die for freedom , like the man in the story , would bring eternal rewards . Cosmic rewards . A better life , he thought . Reward . Freedom . Suddenly , he realized that he valued freedom above all else . He nodded again at this revelation and sipped his warming beer . And as he sipped , he ran his fingers thoughtfully over the heavy silver T that hung at his throat .  | David was dozing in his skiptor compartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the landing on Vesta . Groggily , he pulled the lever . Gossamer-light strands enveloped him . The visiscreen showed the rocky curve of the asteroid set in the black of space . Stars blazed beyond Vesta 's horizon . He had been dreaming mixed fragmented dreams . They clung to him like mist . It had been seven years since he 'd been put on the skiptor for earth . That time , Liss rode in a neighboring compartment ; her face had been a constant companion on the little screen . In his dream , she looked the same ? a freckled , blue-eyed child , but she was somehow an almostadult too . Going back to Vesta for the ceremonies . He shook his head , clearing it , and reached out for the drinking tube in the wall to his right . It slid out and he sucked deeply on it . The last hope of the dream fell away . Liss would n't be here . She was born on Hoffmeir ; she 'd join the Society of Adults there . He 'd never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had told him  --  that it was a man-made habitat with an artist 's colony , a university , and a collection of government officials . He tried to invent from this a vision of Liss 's home , but no pictures came to mind . On his screen , the giant bays of Vesta were opening . He was really going home . He did n't know how to feel , so he settled on a place between scared and nervous . Today , he was  | David Defour ; tomorrow , he was going to meet his parents . Tomorrow , he was going to be somebody . People gave him curious stares when he debarked and rode the zontilator toward the Arrow boarding area . He wore the clothes of an Earther . The hood of his outer shirt was flung back revealing its lining , the rose-pink of music . The shirt felt warm in the controlled air of Vesta . He adjusted the shoulder pack he carried . It felt light ; he felt light  --  light as a duck feather . His muscles , strengthened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the crowd of people in a giant leap , he was sure . He looked from face to face , hoping for a familiar one . They were all strangers . Two minutes more , and he was boarding the sector six Arrow . The Arrow pulled away from its boarding dock , gathered speed and surged along a tunnel until it burst out in the Dayglow of Periphery . Housing clusters squatted between clumps of greenery . In a minute , the Arrow sped by Dome Lake Park . The waters reflected the blue of the curving dome above it . He had planned to head straight back to his old dorm , but instead , he got off at Arrow Hub and took the sublif to Sustenance Level . He emerged to a Dayglow field of grain . Robotenders swung along the rows , tilling blades whirling . David began to walk . It felt so strange to be back . It was as if his body and his mind were totally out of tune with Vesta . He reached in his pack and brought out his little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range . It was picking up the faint hum of machinery  --  the mechanical pulse of Vesta . He turned a dial . Different sensors took over . He watched the tracings  --  the infrasound of Vesta itself , subaudible sounds of molecule upon molecule of rock expanding and contracting . It was rhythmic , slow and totally unlike any earth tracing he 'd seen . He started to transpose the tracing into the audible range , but as he touched the dial , a fat drop of water struck his nose , followed by another smacking into his eye . In seconds he 'd be caught in a downpour ; it was a programmed shower . Running ,  | head down , he scurried back to the sublif , jumped aboard and headed back to Arrow Hub . " Name , please , " said the woman . She wore the green uniform of Adolescent Center Dormitory . He did n't know her . " David Defour . " She punched a code . Then she nodded , " Seven twentytwo . " She handed him a slip of plaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused for a minute . He 'd forgotten his way . He looked around the wide room . Which way was corridor seven ? Nothing looked familiar . Then he spotted it , walked down the long hall to the area marked " twentyforty , " and went in . He 'd never lived in this part before ; he 'd stayed in the level just below . He stood in a large commons room . One wall glowed green , while the three-dimensional words WELCOME ADULTS emerged in cobalt blue . A large vinifountain spouted in the center of the room . Seven or eight boys his age stood around it , filling their cups from its straw-colored cascades . A dozen lounged on softies talking or watching the three-vee parade of younger children who marched along the main esplanade with festival banners . Clutching his pack , he stood at the door and looked for someone he knew . Then hesitantly , he walked to the vinifountain , filled a cup , and slowly looked around the room . " Who 's that ? " said one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the splashing fountain and the threevee parade kept on as every voice hushed and every pair of eyes in the room stared at him . " It 's a mort , " said a voice . " Is it David ? " " It 's David , " said a red-haired boy . Someone jostled his elbow . His cup sloshed and sent a little river down its side and onto the floor . He took a quick gulp and drained the glass . They all began to speak at once : " He does n't look so different from us. "  | " Not yet . " " Except for his clothes . " " Say , look at his ring . " " What 's he wearing pink for ? " He stood staring at them . He felt his head begin to spin . Whether it was due to the drink or the crowd of people around him , he was n't sure . Then a blond boy said , " Leave him alone for a while , will you ? " The crowd fell back and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " What 's your number ? " " Twenty-two . " They walked out of the commons into a hallway and came to another room . Five beds were rolled along the wall . " You 're here , " said the boy . " I 'm over there . Do you remember me ? I 'm Martin . " Memories of a chubby boy snoring in the next bed came swirling back . They had been friends , but it was so long ago . What was the best way to take up the threads of a boyhood friendship ? He was n't sure , but he was happy to try . He grinned . " Yes , I remember you . " He thrust out his hand to Martin . The boy stared at David 's hand and made no move to take it for a few seconds . Then , he reached out stiffly and grasped David 's . " I 'm monitor here . I 'll see to it that everybody leaves you alone . " David 's grin slowly faded . " I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " Oh . Well , that might be nice . But , right now , I 'm busy . " Martin turned away , paused , then said , " Let me know if anyone bothers you . If there 's any trouble , I 'm responsible . " The boy stared at him for a moment , turned , and walked out of the room . David sat still for a few minutes trying to understand what was happening . Then he got up and went back to the commons room . Martin stood near the fountain with a group of boys . As David walked in , they stopped talking and stared at him curiously .  | He looked at them one at a time , remembering . These were the boys he 'd spent the first eleven years of his life with . They 'd gone to school together , slept together , eaten together for the biggest part of their life . Standing near the fountain was Jeremy  --  red-headed , pale-skinned Jeremy . They 'd driven fat Mother Chin crazy with their mischief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Michael , pudgy and a little thickheaded , but always a friend . He 'd helped Michael with his math nearly every night . He looked from one to the other as a thousand memories jostled in his brain , and then he said , " It was nice to see you all again , one last time . " As they stared , he shouldered his pack and walked out . He did n't know where he was going , he only knew that he wanted to get away from there  --  from them . He emerged briefly from a jumble of thoughts to find himself on the Arrow , headed for the main esplanade . The hurt splashed over him again . They 'd made him feel like a malformed thing that belonged in a biologist 's jar . Who did they think they were anyway ? Bunch of technicians . The Arrow sighed to a stop amid the glittering lights of Vesta 's heart . He got off and stepped onto the zontilator . It carried him along the publicway , past the arena , past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bars . He stepped off the zont onto the stationary walkway at its edge . For a while , he walked along it , feeling numb and very alone . A flashing sign above a door caught his eye : " The Rings . " He walked inside . It was dark . Holos of the outer planets hung just above eye-level ; their rings revolved slowly in translucent orbit . He found a seat near the door in a small pod . At the pressure of his body against the seat , a small communicator bank presented . A voice said , " How may we serve you ? " He was n't hungry at all . He thought a moment , " Wine . I want a glass of wine . " It seemed as good a way as any to spend the evening . " Certainly . " A choice list presented . The list did n't mean anything to him . He pressed one at random . " Credit , please . "  | He felt panicky for a moment ; he did n't have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the credex panel . A quick blue flash , then , in a moment , a small door slid open . He reached in , took out his glass of wine and began to sip . He barely noticed when the man and the woman came up to his side . " We saw your little transaction , " she said . He looked up , puzzled . " Your ring . " She slid into the seat next to him . " Mind if we join you ? " " I guess not . " He was a little confused by their attention . " I 'm Mria , " said the woman . She was very pretty . Her hair was long and pale . As she leaned toward him , a strand of it fell across his hand . " You 're just off the skip , are n't you ? " said the man . He was slim with curly dark hair . David nodded . " I knew it , " the man said . He reached out and touched David 's shoulder , squeezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's yours ? " David 's dark eyes flitted from one to the other . " David . My name 's David . " " Here for the big day tomorrow ? " Ric 's hand stayed on his shoulder . David nodded . " We thought so , " said Mria . Her hand fell lightly on his . She touched his ring , shivered once , and pressed her bare arm and shoulder against him . She smelled wonderful . It had been a long time since a girl had touched him like that . He smiled at her shyly . She looked deep into his eyes , and he looked back . Her eyes were pale and green . " You 're pretty , " he blurted . She tilted her head coyly . One corner of her lips rose in a smile . " You 've very sweet , David . " Her fingers moved and twined through his . He felt a throbbing in his groin . He did n't know what was happening , but it was very pleasant . And she smelled so good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell me , David . How do you like us here ? " " Fine , " he stammered .  | Ric moved closer toward him and dropped his other hand to David 's leg . The fingers played along his thigh . He felt himself grow tense . The hand moved along his leg , massaging its way toward his groin . He pulled his body away from Ric and found it colliding with Mria 's . A hot blush colored his face . " Stop it , " he said . The hand paused , moved again . " Stop it , please . " " Leave him alone , Ric , " said Mria . " He does n't like you . He does n't like men . " The hand stopped , pinched viciously , and was gone . Ric stood up , glaring at him . " Better think twice , little mort . You wo n't be pretty for long . " With a final glare , he turned and walked out . " I 'm sorry for that , " said Mria . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Immensely relieved that the man had gone , David leaned back in his seat and breathed deeply . He was still blushing . He did n't know what to say to her . " Do you  --  Do you want some wine or something ? " " That would be wonderful , David . " Her hair brushed across his cheek . He ordered two drinks . He was beginning to feel a little giddy , a little drowsy . She sipped hers and leaned closer toward him . He felt the length of her thigh press against his . His groin throbbed . " Why did you sit over here ? With me ? " " You excite me , David . " Her fingers began to explore his earlobe . " I do ? " His ear felt warm . Probably red like the rest of his face . He took a gulp of wine . " You 're so fresh . Like a flower . Something to be picked before it fades . " She touched his neck . " They fade so quickly . " Slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm mortal . That 's why you 're  --  why I excite you . " " You do understand . " Her fingers ran up into his hair , prickling the back of his neck . " The others , like me  --  they 're always around . Whenever you want them . But you ? " He felt sick . He felt his body stiffen , and he felt sick . He  | pulled himself away from her , staring at her all the while with wide , dark eyes . Then he stood , throwing his pack over his shoulder . He said , " I have to go now , " and he was gone , out the door , running down the walkway as if demons were after him . He got off the zont at the first place to stay he saw , the State Hotel . The lobby was empty . He requested a room from the communicator and pressed his ring against the credex panel . A display flashed on the screen telling him where to go , giving him his combination number . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the combo and locked the door behind him . He set his pack on the floor and examined the bed lever . It was an unfamiliar type , but the catch gave way with a touch , and he sank down on the bed almost before it unrolled . He felt exhausted . He lay on his back for perhaps ten minutes staring at the rosy ceiling panel , trying not to think about the things that crowded into his mind . Twice today he 'd felt like a freak  --  a foolish , miserable freak  --  like something that normal people look away from or else stare at to satisfy their curiosity . The thoughts would n't go away . No matter how he tried to divert himself , they kept creeping back , growing , jostling his mind . After a few more minutes , he sat up and reached for his pack . Opening it , he drew out his flute , and as he did a half-dozen silver tapes spilled out . He looked at them ruefully , remembering his encounter with the whale man . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvelous infrasound . He 'd been using the tapes as substitutes for working ? but not anymore . Brushing them aside , he fitted his flute together . He 'd take those thoughts that cluttered his mind , those emotions that tore at his brain , and he 'd push them out of his flute . He could transform them , exorcise them . He had a brief notion of the effect the piece he 'd write would have . They might look at him now like a strange creature from outer space or something , but they would n't for long . They 'd be too busy trying to get tickets to his concerts and asking for his autograph on their programs .  | He began to blow softly on his flute . The breathy notes rose and fell in an effortless scale and then in a series of arpeggios . He needed to warm up a bit , he told himself , then he 'd let the ideas flow . As he played his scales , his exercises , the nagging thought came that he was n't warming up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was n't he ? Well , if that were so , then why was he exercising his fingers instead of his mind ? And how could he warm up his mind ? He concentrated harder on the music he wanted to write . He flung the flute down on the bed and paced around the room , humming snatches of melody , rejecting them as derivative , or worse , ordinary . Tomorrow would be better , he thought at last . Tomorrow he 'd meet his parents . He 'd belong somewhere . But then he had to ask himself , " and after that , what ? " He was a mortal now . Sooner or later he 'd have to pull away from his parents ' world . He 'd have to create  --  have to . It was all he had left now . He sat on the bed again and lifted his flute to his lips . For an hour he played scales and arpeggios effortlessly , with the skill that came of long practice . And all the while , the tears streamed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was . He rolled over , stared at the room , rubbed the sleep from his eyes and stared again . Gradually , he remembered  --  the hotel . At the door , the lock light still glowed . He sprayed clean and pulled his clothes from the Ultrason , pleased that they felt fresh again . Fresher than he did , he thought as he picked up his pack and left the hotel . Outside , on the esplanade , he stepped on the zont and headed for the arena . Traffic was heavy . It looked as if everyone on Vesta was headed there too . Banners fluttered in the vent streams as he rolled by . Near the arena , a uniformed group of twelve-year-old girls marched in formation , twirling shields that glittered bright in the Dayglow . One girl dropped hers . It spun in a silvery arc overhead until it dropped within reach of one of the dorm parents . Grinning , he flipped it back to the blushing girl . At the gates of the arena , more banners fluttered , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who seemed to be in charge looked at his embossed plaper and said , " Check your pack here , please . " He pulled it off his shoulder and handed it to her . " Second lifter , " she said , " then right . " He found himself just outside a door leading to the center atrium of the arena . A woman in a green uniform paused in her terse instructions to the group to glare at him for his lateness . He stuck the badge she gave him onto his shirt and self-consciously fell in with the group . In another minute , the doors swung open and they marched into the arena . Although there were no more than ninety eighteen-year-olds with him , the arena was packed . He 'd never seen so many people in one place before . An orchestra played the Song of Allegiance . Then suddenly a group of children ran across the field in front of David ? a somehow familiar group of children . He wrinkled his forehead in puzzlement . Why were they there ? And why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew why . He was looking at himself and the rest of the troupe  --  holos of his childhood . The stream of children dissolved . Then the formal introductions began . A holo appeared of a baby in a tiny crib . " Ginna Ayfour , " said a voice . The crowd rustled its applause . The list went on . At each name , an infant holo appeared . When the voice called out , " David Defour , " he was appalled at the squalling red thing that projected . He felt relieved when Janna Deseven 's infant self took his place . The parade of holos continued through the long ceremony . He saw himself as a toddler , a puny six-year-old and a leggy ten-year-old . He wondered how his parents were reacting to these sights of him . They 'd be given a commemorative series of holos  --  one of each age . He grimaced . Maybe they would n't want the one of him as a baby . At a signal from the orchestra , a group of young girls ran into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holos . They wore the color code he 'd worn when he first left Vesta  --  light blue , so they were ten to twelve years old . They had been trained for the dance . As the music started , they began a series of gymnastic  | moves that were different from the earth dances he 'd seen . Then he realized why . The light gravity of Vesta made the difference  --  soaring aerial turns that would have been impossible on earth . They were quite competent really , probably trained since they were four or five years old ; but one girl was different . She danced quite close to David . Tiny and lovely , her delicate heart-shaped face tilted away from the curve of her arm as she moved to the music . Her eyes were deep gray and turned upward at the edges , serious as they looked out toward the audience , but her mouth curved in a smile . He could n't stop watching her . When she danced , she floated , swam , soared , flew . When it was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a sense of loss and he could n't imagine why . Other dancers , singers and aerialists followed . Then the orchestra began the moving chords of " Our New Adults . " The field , transformed at the hands of a visiographer , bloomed with roses  --  not as subtle as Lindner 's work , but effective . As the sounds of the orchestra faded , a voice said , " Ginna Ayfour , your parents welcome you . " The girl stood and walked shyly to the center of the arena . From one side came a man and woman walking toward her . " The Honorable Cayse Rabb , the citizeness Lee Dana Rabb . " The couple walked up to the girl . They spoke , but David could n't make out what they said , then all three were touching hands , then kissing and hugging . His dark eyes glowed , yet he felt as if his insides were quivering . He knew his parents would be important people . They had to be ; no one else , except mortals , was allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ginna Rabb , " and the girl walked slowly back to his group . Later , she would meet her parents again at the dinners and festivities that followed . That was when the parents introduced their new son or daughter to their circle of friends . As each name was called , David grew more nervous . Finally , he heard his own . He walked to the center and looked anxiously toward the group of parents . A couple emerged and began to walk toward him  | " The Honorable Ivan Trofimoff , and First Citizeness Ruth Stine Trofimoff . " They were halfway to him now . Trofimoff , he thought . That was his name . He sounded it softly , " Tro  --  feem  --  off , David Trofimoff . " Then they were there , the tall , thin man , the small dark woman . They looked no more than twenty-five or so . " Hello , " he said smiling shyly . The woman came close . She was speaking , " . . . so sorry , David , that we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused on him , but on some place beyond him . " . . . so busy ... " He felt the shock slip over him as cold as the icy mountain waters of Renascence . Holos . They were nothing but holos . He could see the shimmery telltale signs around the edges of the projections now . The man was saying , " . . . trip was necessary . . . " The woman said , " . . . must come for a visit sometime ... " Waves of pain and helpless rage washed over him . He turned and walked back to the group , hoping no one noticed him . He barely heard the rest of the ceremony . One thought kept going through his mind  --  Trofimoff . He 'd never use it ; he 'd never take that name . When the ceremony was over , the surge of the jostling crowd swept him out of the arena . He reclaimed his pack from the woman in charge and walked out onto the esplanade . Long tables full of food lined the publicway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group with their new parents , talking , eating , drinking from the vinifountains that danced in the Dayglow . He passed the food , the fountains , feeling his face burn hot with embarrassment . He 'd never take their name . He stepped on the zontilator and did n't look back until the sounds of the festival had faded to nothing . Then he allowed himself to turn , to look wistfully over his shoulder . In another minute , he 'd reached the Arrow . He got off the Arrow at skiptor boarding . He could only think of one thing  --  Liss . He wanted to see Liss . There was a skip leaving for Hoffmeir in two hours . When  | it was his turn to board , the uniformed flightman looked at the badge on David 's shirt and said , " You 're missing the big day . Hoffmeir had only a fraction of the population of Vesta . Thirty thousand people lived there , nine hundred of them mortals . It was the largest colony of artists and musicians in the belt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been in an artificial habitat before . He stood near the periphery and looked around in awe . You could see it all from one place ! Across the area where clustered dwellings were interspersed with low green shrubs , he could see a round green belt and then , beyond , more housing . He seemed to be looking down in a basin , but when he whirled around , it was he that stood in the bowl . Hills , dotted with structures , rose around him . He was briefly dizzy . There was no Arrow here , only a network of moving zontilators . He found a communicator bank and asked for Liss McNabb . The machine voice said , " Information not available . " He did n't know what to do ; then he thought of calling her parents . Within a minute , a woman 's voice said , " Cara , here . " The visiscreen came into focus . She was a middle-aged version of Liss . Her blue eyes stared at him . For a moment he could n't speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . David Defour , from Renascence . I 'm looking for Liss . " A smile came warmly over the screen . " Oh , yes . Liss told us about you . How nice that you 're here . But Liss and Kurt have gone to Earth . She 'll be so sorry she missed you . " " Liss and Kurt ? " The woman paused . " Oh , did n't you know ? They entered a term-contract of marriage shortly after she left Renascence . " The words did n't register for a few moments . " A termcontract ? " But that was never issued unless the people had permission to have a child . " A term-contract ? " he said again . His voice sounded strange to him . " With Kurt ? " " Yes . Kurt Kraus . He 's the Minister of Culture . "  | The image of the man at Tanya Rolfe 's funeral came rushing back . He stood staring helplessly at the screen . " Their baby is at Cluster Dorm , " said the woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't allowed . " She sighed , then she said , " She 's fifteen months old now . " Somehow he managed to say his goodbyes to Liss 's mother . Somehow he managed to draw breath into his lungs and modulate it out again in syllables and words . When the screen went blank , he continued to stare at it for a while as if it were of extreme interest . Then he began to walk . He found himself on a zontilator . He did n't know where it was going , but it did n't matter . After a while , he heard music . He looked dully around . It was an artist 's colony . A collection of boys and girls were dancing on a little patch of green to the music of a trio of woodwinds  --  a rehearsal of some sort . An old man sat with a plastique board across his lap making deft impressions of the dancers with his stylus . Without realizing it , David stepped off the zont . The old man reached for a bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David watched , the clear fluid changed to opaque buff . The old man peeled the picture from the plastique and looked at it . The bronzed lines of the sketch stood in stark relief from the pale film . As the film moved in the old man 's hands , the figures seemed to dance . The artist smiled up at David . His skin was translucent from extreme age ; his cheeks were pink . " How can I help you , son ? Are you lost ? " David looked at him , and then without knowing why , he said , " I 'm looking for Cluster Dorm . " " Why , it 's right over there . " David 's gaze followed the bent old finger . It pointed at a large structure beyond a small pond with a central fountain . The dorm was about a tenth of a kilometer away . " Thank you , " he said , but he made no move to go . " You 're from earth , " said the old man . " Renascence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | " You wear the colors of music . " Gnarled fingers guided the stylus over the sketchboard . " What do you play ? " " Cythar and flute  --  and the symphosizer . I use it to compose . I  --  I 'm a composer . " He watched the old man 's hands ; he could n't meet his eyes . He 'd barely been able to get the words out . Composer . Lie . Anxiously , he looked at the old artist . Did he know ? The old man reached for his bottle and sprayed a layer of liquid over the plastique . As the film grew opaque , he watched David keenly . " It 's hard for many of us at times  --  at first . " He peeled the film from the picture , looked at it and handed it to David . It was a quick sketch , only a few lines , but it had captured David 's expression . " Keep it , son , " said the old man . " Maybe you 'll need to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned away , glancing at the picture again . He found it disturbing . It was the eyes : wide , dark and , somehow , very remote . He told the woman in charge of Cluster Dorm , " I want to see Liss Kraus 's baby . " The bored look on her face faded . " You do ? We do n't have many requests to see the children . " She checked the communicator and then said , " Follow me . " He walked with her down a corridor , wondering the whole time why he was there . It was as if he had to come , had to prove to himself that Liss was really gone forever . At the end of the corridor , another hallway intersected , and they turned left . They stopped outside a wide curtained window . The woman pressed a button in the wall . When someone answered , she said , " Visitor to see Alani Elten . " " Right away . " " They 'll open the curtain in a moment , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I want to go inside , " he said . He did n't know why he said it . " Oh , no . It is n't allowed . " " Why not ? I want to go in. "  | She seemed shocked . " It 's never allowed . If we permitted intermingling , then the ones who are n't allowed to reproduce would be jealous . We ca n't have discontent , " She stared at him . " It 's against all the rules . " The curtain opened , and David looked through the oneway window into the nursery . There were seven toddlers in the room and two dorm Mothers . One of them said , " Come here , Alani . " As David watched , a tiny girl took two tottery steps toward the Mother , and then started to fall . She saved her balance by planting two pudgy hands on the floor . She wobbled like that for a moment or two with her little bottom sticking up in the air . Then the baby managed to stand up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely and she plopped abruptly to her diapered rear with a surprised look on her face . The dorm Mother swooped down on the child with a laugh . Picking her up , the woman planted a kiss on a fat little cheek and brought her to the window . David blinked . The baby looked like Liss . She peered out of clear blue eyes , and her nose was a tiny . pug . And she was wearing something around her neck  --  a little gold chain with a small amethyst dangling from it . He drew in a breath . Liss had n't even kept the necklace ; she 'd put it around the neck of her baby  --  Kurt Kraus 's baby . He turned away from the window . So it really was over . He 'd never see Liss again . He muttered his thanks to the woman in charge and walked out of Cluster Dorm , feeling more alone than he had ever felt before . The next day , he caught the first skiptor back to earth . It was a hopper with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pack in the saf-T-cab of the compartment and settling back in his seat , he switched on the music bank and tried not to think ; but his mind slipped into freefall long before the skiptor did . What was he going to do now ? He was running away , he knew , but he did n't fit anymore  --  not in Vesta  --  not on Hoffmeir either . So he was running back to Renascence . On the surface of it , the thought gave him comfort . It would be good  | to be back , to feel the cool air , see the shadows on the mountains  --  but then what ? What was he going to do with the rest of his life ? If he could n't work , could n't compose . . . . He would n't fit there either . The thought settled coldly in his head . It was true . He did n't belong at Renascence  --  not any more than Liss did ? but she 'd had sense enough to know it . He did n't belong at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else either . The coldness spread , chilling him . His fingers curled , making fists . He felt nails bite into his palm , and he squeezed his hands tighter , hanging onto the pain in them , hanging onto it because the other pain was harder to bear . The white skin stretched over his knuckles . Slowly he opened his hands , staring at them , at the ring he wore . It glowed dully in the diffused cabin light . If he 'd never put it on , his music would have died naturally . And would n't that have been better ? Better than to let it erode his soul a bit at a time until there was nothing left . He felt hot tears sting his eyes . He was a drone  --  a bum . Like the whale man . Fit for nothing more than to wander alone over the earth without even a dream  --  without even the hope of one . The skiptor had a short layover in Vesta , then once again the huge bays opened , and the ship moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music bank and sat in silence in his compartment staring at the visiscreen with its thousands of stars ; but the images did n't register on his brain . He 'd eaten nothing since the day before ; he felt no hunger now . He felt nothing at all except for a pervasive numbness , a remoteness . Finally , he became aware of the screen in front of him full of points of light , isolated , just as he was . When the face came on the screen , speaking to him , it was an intrusion and he did n't want to hear the words . " . . . hesitated to invade your privacy , but I knew you were from Renascence . . . " It was the flightman. " . . . this child is near hysteria . . . would you help ? She 's in cabin six .  | David blinked . He was supposed to help someone ? " If you would , just flip on your intercom , " said the flightman . " Compartment six . " He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , then he said , " Why not ? " The flightman thanked him , and the face disappeared . David reached out and pressed the button for compartment six . A view of the compartment flashed on the screen . Dwarfed by the seat she huddled in , a girl sat curled in a ball of misery , hands pressed over her face , knees drawn up to her chest . She seemed to be choking . Sharp gasps shook her thin little body . Pale hair fell over tear-wet fingers . Alarmed , David said , " Hello . " And then immediately felt like a fool . But what else could he say ? He did n't even know her name . She did n't respond to his voice  --  just kept making those terrible gasping moans . She wore the light blue uniform of the ten- to twelve-year-olds of Vesta Central . Obviously she 'd been taken aboard that morning with only the sketchiest notion of where she was going or why . In a shivering instant , he was eleven years old again and terrified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only home he 'd ever known . " Stop it , " he said . " Do n't cry . " The sharpness of his voice startled her ; she looked up . Her face was red and swollen from crying , but not enough to disguise its delicate heart-shaped lines . Wet gray eyes tilting upward at the edges peered at him . He stared back with a shock of recognition . It was the little dancer he 'd seen at the Ceremony of Adults . " I know you , " he said . " I saw you dance . What 's your name ? " The gasping sobs continued , " St  --  St  --  Stoey , " she managed to say and then buried her face in her hands again . He knew her pain  --  he could feel it . It was like his own had been . He tried to divert her , " I guess you want to be a dancer . You 'll make a wonderful dancer , Stoey . " The hand stayed clamped over her face . She shook her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasps . " Do n't you want to be a dancer ? "  | She shook her head again . " A chor  --  A chor  --  A chor  --  e ? og  --  rapher . " Her misery communicated through the screen so well that David felt his breath catch in rhythm with hers . He wished he could reach out , touch her , pet her , comfort her . Instead he said , " You 'll like Renascence . You can learn to be a fine choreographer there . " The sobbing started up again , harder . He 'd said the wrong thing to her . Could n't he ever think of the right thing to say ? He tried again , " I lived in Renascence . A long time . I 'm going back . " She sucked in a hard breath and peeped at him between her fingers . " You  --  You are ? " He nodded . " It 's nice there . It really is . Renascence has mountains and waterfalls and wild animals . And  --  the wind blows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled in fists against her face . He 'd done it again . He 'd scared her more , instead of comforting her . How could he have been so stupid ? He looked around the compartment in despair . If only he could tear through those walls that enclosed him  --  get to her somehow ? make her understand . Then , he had a thought . He pulled open the cabinet and hauled out his pack . " I 'll show you , Stoey . It 'll be all right . " He pulled out his recorder and a bright silver tape disc . At that moment , the skiptor moved into freefall , and his cabin was filled with a dozen silver discs floating through the air . He slammed the pack shut , just as his flute began to nudge its way out . Releasing his restraining harness , he grabbed at the little tapes as they drifted by . Stoey 's eyes grew wide at his frantic activity . She forgot to cry . When the recalcitrant tapes were at last corralled , he pulled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but one tape back inside , and managed to slip that one into his recorder . Then he pushed the machine under a restraining strap and turned it on , twirling a dial , bringing the infrasound up to just audible range . " Listen , Stoey . Listen , " he said ur- gently . " This is Renascence . This is the song the Earth sings . Listen . " The slow , low-pitched familiar rhythms of Renascence began to play . Stoey 's eyes grew even wider . " It 's  --  heavy there , " she managed to say . " But that is n't all , Stoey . Renascence has bird songs and little creek sounds . It ? " He clenched his fist once in his attempt to make her understand . Then he drew his pack to him and carefully pulled out his flute . " Listen , Stoey . It 's like this . " Against the slow insistent infrasound rhythms , he blew a soft bird call into his flute  --  the call of a wood thrush throbbing its sweet sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lee , Ee  --  o ? lay , Ee  --  o ? lee . It ended in a trill . He blew another wood thrush  --  answering , inventing . The trill ended in the rush of a tiny stream chattering , laughing , dancing from rock to rock . Stoey looked at him with something more than tears shining from her gray eyes . He felt elated ; he was making her understand . He blew again into his flute , and the music that came out whispered like new poplar leaves . He blew the erratic whimsical rhythms of a hopping rabbit , a fragile fawn . Out of the corner of his eye , he watched the screen . He saw Stoey reach down and release the restraining harness that bound her until she floated free at the end of a single tether . She began to dance . She danced so subtly , so beautifully that she took his breath from him . Then he found it again and blew into his horn , matching the flute sounds to the movements of her body . He marveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little compartment , she moved to the music like a fragile bird in a cage . He varied rhythms , tried to fool her body with them , but she danced as if she were a thought that moved within his mind . And neither he nor Stoey stopped until the tape  --  the song of Renascence  --  came to an end . They boarded the Renascence hover at Biscayne-Atlantic Terminal and talked until the mountains came into view . Then they watched through the curving windows as the hover  | swooped along the rushing river . When the clearing came in sight , the craft 's forward motion slowed , and it settled gently to the ground . He helped her out of the hover , watching her face , seeing her take her first look at Renascence . She managed a little smile , but it vanished as her knees buckled from the unaccustomed pull of Earth 's gravity . " Oh , I 'll never be able to dance here . " He caught her arm , steadying her , " Yes , you will . It 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the green clearing and the smoky blue mountains beyond . Her gray eyes were huge and luminous , " You were right , David . It feels like you told me it would . " He smiled down at her , not contradicting her , not wanting to , because he had told her  --  with his music . Then , he suddenly knew what music really was  --  communication . Strange that he 'd never realized it before . He 'd cut it off and then called himself lonely . Even a whale would know better . Even a whale . He grinned . He was eighteen now ; he was a man  --  a man who could learn to be as smart as a whale . He felt himself grin wider , idiotically , but he did n't mind at all . He guided the little girl with wobbling legs toward a small wooden cabin next to the lake . " Come on , Stoey . First you need to rest awhile , " he said , " and then I 'll show you what home looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand stars glittered over Renascence . A breeze tangled in the new leaves . The creek spun foam and drummed its waters in a rocky hollow outside David 's cabin . The light from his window winked with his passing as he walked back and forth in front of the single lamp . While all Renascence slept , he paced , then dropped to a hunching seat before his console , then rose to pace again . They had brought him dinner as they had every night for a month . It sat untouched on a small table against the wall . A whippoorwill began to call in the darkness , and then another answered faintly in the distance . Finally David sat again before his console and did not leave his perch until the sun shone yellow over the mountains and glittered on the riffling waters of the lake . The door to his cabin burst open then , and he ran out into the sunlight bearing a sheaf of print-outs from the symphosizer . He raised them in one hand held high over his head and , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He jumped in the air , came down , touching toes just once on the little porch , and leaped to the ground , running as he touched  --  running , whooping , with madhouse glee . He sprang along the edge of a tiny spring studded with pale green ferns and shaded by sycamore and oak . As if possessed , he leaped back and forth in an eccentric zigzagging path along the little stream , then veered off in a hopping gait through a daisy field , startling a rabbit in his path .  | After pausing once to shake the print-outs once again in the face of the sun , he flipped himself in a somersaulting roll and came up balancing precariously on one foot . Then leaping and shouting , he threw open the door to the dining hall , running among the people dawdling over a late breakfast , shaking his manuscript in their amazed faces . " It 's good ! It 's really good ! " And before they could recover their wits , he ran out again , whooping like a maniac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the water 's edge , splashing , yelling to the mountains , " It 's good ! " Two dozen startled faces watched his progress as he followed the curve of the lake toward the Common Hall , yelling , shaking his manuscript and pausing now and then to leap into the air . A couple in a rowboat stared as he made his crazed progress around the lake , ran up the wide stone steps of the Common Hall and burst in , interrupting a mime show with a yell . " It 's good ! It is ! It 's good ! " He flung his manuscript into the air . Ducking the fluttering rain of pages , the people inside stared at his amazing progress through the building and out on the wide cantilevered deck that overhung the lake . He scrambled up on the railing and , with a final screech of delight , launched himself , mouth open , into the bone-chilling waters . He sank like a stone , emerged , sank again , and rose once more , yelling , choking , sputtering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . The rowboat pulled up in his wake and offered him the end of an oar . Grinning , sputtering , he grabbed it . " I guess he 's finished his masterpiece , " said someone amid the laughing from the deck above . " I wonder what he 'll call it ? " " No question , " said another , " Music to Drown By . ' "  | Dayglow on Hebe had faded to shades of gray on charcoal . The lights of Colony Park spread dim pools on the phalanx of marching children . They drilled precisely , perfectly , to the muffled beat of drums . Lights spun hypnotically from their whirling shields . Kurt watched from the reviewing stand . Liss sat next to him . For a time , she had entered notes in ' the small machine she held , but now she stared at the shields and the light patterns . There was a look on her face that disturbed Kurt . It was a look he had seen before , a look that comes into the eyes of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the eyes must dilate to take in all the scene , and then , glittering excitement . Her mouth was slightly open , her eyes locked on the whirling shields . He touched her hand . She ignored it , staring down at the marchers , and her lips began to move in concert with the drumbeat . Kurt leaned toward her , " What is it , Liss ? " He put his head near hers and strained to hear . She stared ahead ; her lips moved  --  a whisper , " Silver T ... Silver T .... " A man at the periphery of the crowd leaped to his feet . His amplified voice carried easily over the drumbeat , " Give us Commerce . " Kurt 's eyes narrowed . The man was a plant . Part of an overall plan . Since the assassination of the Minister of Com- merce , the colonies had organized to demand that Prime Minister Gerstein appoint a successor from the belt . And Deputy Minister Tarantino had smiled ingenuously and pointed out that indeed there had never been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to listen to the people . He spoke of the " face of resolution , " intimating how difficult it was to change public opinion , shaking his head sadly as if he were not quite equal to the task . But he would , of course , cooperate with Earth in any way . The plant in the audience yelled again , " Give us Commerce . " The people echoed it , fitting it to the cadence of the muffled drums , the wheeling shields . " Commerce . . . Commerce . . . Commerce .... " The children below drilled on , to a faster cadence now . They performed with a measured frenzy to the chant of thousands . Kurt stared at the field . He was watching a masterful performance , a performance with all the spontaneity of a machine . And the performance was being broadcast to every colony in space . He looked uneasily at Liss . She stared ahead . Her lips moved with the cadence . He took her hand . Her hand clutched his ; her voice rang with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Commerce .... " " Liss ? " She squeezed his hand , twisting his fingers cruelly , and began to pant , gasping as if she were suffocating . " Liss ! " She turned her face to him then . Beads of sweat stood out on her forehead . Her brow was arched , her eyes wide with horror . She stared into his without seeing them , and to the cadence of the drums her lips moved again : " Awful , awful , awful , ohgod , awful .... " He stood and , with an arm around her , lifted her to a standing position , half-walking , half-dragging her into a small dim room in the back . The people around them seemed oblivious as they chanted to the rhythm of the whirling shields . " Help me , " Kurt said to the Deputy Minister 's aide who had followed him automatically .  | The woman stared at him without seeming to understand . " Help me with her , " he snapped . " She 's sick . " " Sick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggled with Liss and managed to lay her down on soft cushions , the woman stared at the sobbing girl . Slowly comprehension spread over her face . " Why she 's sick , " she said at last . She leaned over Liss , touched her brow , looked with concern into the girl 's eyes . And as she did , the heavy silver T at her throat swung and glittered in the flickering light .
