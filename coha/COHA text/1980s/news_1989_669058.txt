Sports mirrors the cycles of our existence . Winners are born , winners die . In between , champions think they will live forever . When the 1980s began , Tony LaRussa , then managing the White Sox , was told he was in the worst division in baseball . As the decade ends , LaRussa ' s Oakland A ' s have altered that opinion of the American League West . The same metamorphosis could be in its infancy stages in the National Hockey League ' s Norris Division . As this week began , only one division featured three teams with records over . 500 , and that was the long-scorned Norris . The Blackhawks , Minnesota and St. Louis were a combined 33-17-5 . Chicago and the Blues were two of just five NHL teams with winning road records . While none of the three have dominated in games within the division , they are faring well against nondivision clubs . Outside the Norris , the Hawks are 10-3-1 , the Stars 7-1-1 and the Blues 5-2-3 . It ' d be a major reversal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the five Norris clubs finished with a record above . 500 against nondivisional competition . Even Detroit , who won the division , was 19-21-8 in this category . St. Louis was 15-26-7 , Minnesota 17-21-10 and the Hawks 15-28-5 . But team and individual honors have come to the Norris in the first quarter of the season . The era of the Norris as a collection of sad sacks could be at an end . Beginning Tuesday , Minnesota ' s Jon Casey led all goalies in victories with his 9-3-1 record . Jacques Cloutier of the Hawks was one of five goalies with eight victories . Casey and Cloutier are two of three goalies to have recorded two shutouts this season . In goal-scoring , St. Louis ' Brett Hull was tied for the NHL lead with 15 . North Star Brian Bellows was close on his heels at 13 and the Hawks ' Troy Murray had 12 . The division has long been famed as the home of Chicago ' s Denis Savard and Detroit ' s Steve Yzerman . Although these offensive stylists remain grand entertainers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent than before . There is much hope for the future based on the career starts of rookies Mike Modano ( Minnesota ) , Rod Brind ' Amour ( St. Louis ) and Jeremy Roenick ( Hawks ) . These three centers are a strong base upon which to build . Modano and Brind ' Amour are second in the NHL among first-year goal-scorers , each with 10 . Brind ' Amour is second in shooting percentage at 32. 3 , scoring his 10 from 31 shots , and second in plus-minus with plus-11 . Roenick doesn ' t yet have the offensive statistics to put up against Modano and Brind ' Amour . Still , he has contributed in his way to the Hawks ' fast start . All three of these improving Norris teams have coaches in their second years . And these leaders are judged to have some of LaRussa ' s characteristics when he nurtured his dream in the early ' 80s-brash , smart and disciplined . The Hawks ' Mike Keenan is the most accomplished of the trio . He has been to two Stanley Cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1985 and 1987 . Brian Sutter of the Blues and Pierre Page of the North Stars are in their first NHL head-coaching jobs . But already , they are figures to be reckoned with in a division known only in recent years as the den of wily Detroit coach Jacques Demers . With Demers at least temporarily on the ropes , languishing in last place , even Toronto and its new coach , recycled Doug Carpenter , are given a chance to nudge the Wings out of a playoff spot . Carpenter had four below-. 500 seasons in New Jersey and is looking for personal retribution with the Maple Leafs . Since the Hawks were shifted to the Norris in 1981-82 , not once has one of the division teams been able to win the Campbell Conference championship and advance to the Stanley Cup finals . But things seem to be changing . At least , that ' s the current hope of the Hawks , North Stars and Blues . They want to see what it ' s like to be favored instead of flustered , respected rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
