STROKER ACE <P> This is the latest model of what might be termed the Burt Reynolds Formula One Vehicle . The sometime bandit is a respectable NASCAR driver in Stroker Ace . That means that the skids and scrapes in which he defies death without losing his good-ole-boy aplomb take place on such premises as the Daytona 500 race track . He is also amiably mystified to find himself drawn to a woman ( Loni Anderson ) who is as tenacious in defense of her virginity as he is in pursuit of a championship . That , however , completes the list of the film 's novelties . As usual , many brawls and gags are thrown in . Reynolds makes these films with a group of good buddies , and as outtakes of on-set goof-offs run over the credits show , they have fun . But the products increasingly resemble the snapshots that guys pass around when they return from a fishing trip . You can almost hear : " Well , you really have to have been there . . . " <P> <P> PUBERTY BLUES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Sydney suburb as if he were an anthropologist and his subjects were an exotic outback tribe . But the somewhat distant and objective manner that served so effectively to dehydrate his Tender Mercies fails him here . Two girls ( prettily played by Nell Schofield and Jad Capelja ) scheme to gain admission to the gang , win acceptance and then at last outgrow the group . The tale is not told with great dramatic intensity . Nor is it really as strange and shocking as Beresford seems to think it is . Indeed , to jaded American eyes these teen-agers are rather mild , old-fashioned and languid in manner . As a result , the film is something of a throwback , as if it might have been called Gidget Meets the Heck 's Angels . <P> <P> ONE DEADLY SUMMER <P> With her pouty face and magnificently sleek body , Isabelle Adjani looks like a Barbie doll grown up and gone bad . At 28 , she has become the divine masochist of the French cinema , playing Truffaut 's Adele H. , or a woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adjani has turned on her siren to play a troubled tramp in a village in southern France . In a cartoon of lust , she sashays provocatively down the main street , shimmies at the local dance , strides naked through backyards-all because of some dreadful childhood demons that take Director Jean Becker 2 hr. 10 min. to exorcise . The movie stinks , but Adjani makes it sizzle . With One Deadly Summer this French Barbie should find her way into the closets of many more overage little boys .
