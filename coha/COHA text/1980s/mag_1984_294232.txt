Mounted on stallions of steel , desert tribesmen fight on and on <P> Largely forgotten amid the world 's more pressing conflicts is the civil war in the central African nation of Chad . In the nine months since France sent 3,000 troops to back the government of President Hissene Habre against Libyan-supported rebels , the two sides have been largely deadlocked . But the fighting goes on : two weeks ago nine French paratroopers were killed on a road in northeastern Chad . TIME Nairobi Bureau Chief James Wilde spent ten days with the Chad army , traveling by Land-Rover from the capital city of N'Djamena to Sahara outposts near the Libyan border . His report : <P> <P> Small groups of Toyota desert vehicles , with 106-mm recoilless rifles mounted at the rear , wheel and charge like cavalry in the vastness of the Sahara . Outriders hang from the sides , firing their AK-47s with deadly grace . Very young and therefore very brave , the men of these small fighting units , or escadrons , whip their Toyotas ' flanks until the vehicles seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stallions . The young soldiers move silently , without war cries except for the high-pitched scream of their engines . <P> These men are part of the first and second regiments of the Chad army , which is fighting a daily game of no-prisoners with the rebels who infiltrate from Libya to the north and Sudan to the east . The enemy also uses escadrons of Toyota vehicles , usually along with a 22-ton Mercedes truck for support . Some of these get through government lines , mine the roads and frighten the local population . When they do engage the army , they usually get the worst of it . In the battlefields of what has come to be called the Great Toyota War , the desert is littered with dead vehicles . <P> If the war were limited to Toyotas , the army would likely hold the day . But the rebels also have armor , and there are daily incursions by Libyan MiGs , which have to be spooked back into Libyan territory by French Jaguar fighters .

Says Deby , a lean , ascetic man with samurai eyes : " Despite all kinds of shortages , we have been able to hold both the Libyan army and the rebels at bay . " Nobody knows exactly how many men the Chad army has . The French say 7,000 ; the Chadians say " many , many . " Its best fighters are the Goran , tribesmen from the northern district of Tibetsi , a starkly beautiful area of volcanic massifs , gorges and craters that was known in antiquity as the land where the wind is born . A French officer says that the Goran are still the finest light cavalrymen in the world . But now , he adds , " they are mounted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
