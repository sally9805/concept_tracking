Please come to Boston for the springtime . . . I ' m staying here with some friends and we ' ve got lots of room . Lots and lots of room . The two of them were alone in the stands along the west end zone , underneath umbrellas and underneath the concrete-rise BU dormitories and all their " Hi Mom , " " Hi ABC " and " Hi Mr. Swann/ Why Retire ? / Play With Us " signs in the windows . No women have ever been more alone on the BU campus than those two . Oh , the five Boston city policemen were in front of them , but they couldn ' t be seen , kneeling there out of the typhoon underneath the DiamondVision scoreboard and shouting , " Run the damn ball . . . Stop passing it . . . Run out the ticking clock . " The Hounds of the Baskervilles never barked through a more dismal scene . ABC-TV had pulled the plug on the Breakers-Invaders game with 6:02 remaining , if anyone out there in Dubuque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left in Nickerson Field , though , were at least 200 diehards , who certainly never will die easy after surviving yesterday . Counts varied , but with five minutes left in the game some 29 fans were left on the north sideline , 6 in the east end zone and those 2 unfortunates in the stands along the west end zone . Both had umbrellas , one blue-and-white and one black , but both were drenched . Excuse me , Debbie Flavin of Natick was asked , but why are you still here in this monsoon ? " Sort of looks crazy , doesn ' t it ? " said Flavin , standing pert halfway up the stands despite the cascading rain . " This may look nuts , but I work over at the Hyatt in Cambridge and I got to like these guys when the Breakers stayed there . I ' ve stayed this long ; might as well stay to the end , right ? " Over in the corner , sitting in the front row all by her lonesome , her fur coat soaked to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This question may seem silly , she was told , but why are you still here ? " I ' ve got a reason , " said Coleman . " I ' m the fiancee of ( Breakers wide receiver ) Frank Lockett and I want to see him play . I ' m not going to get any wetter than I am already , so why should I leave ? Besides , this is the first time I ' ve seen them play , so I ' m staying . " Like an aching tooth , the trauma finally was played out , the Breakers short by 26-7 , and the athletes skidded down to their lockers in the bowels of BU ' s Case Center . " The season ' s not over yet , guys , " guard Gerry Raymond shouted back over his shoulders to his teammates in single file behind him , a few of whom were trying to still chattering teeth . " Lot of games left , " halfback Anthony Steels shouted . " We got a lot of games left . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trench coat soaked , hair soaked , feet soaked , shoes soaked , socks soaked . His wallet may be soaked , too , unless the noble experiment of spring football in Boston takes a turn for the better . Yesterday was to have been the day for the Breakers . Coach Dick Coury and the team had already done more than their part , surprising one and all with a 4-1 record . ABC was finally showing some respect , televising the first game in the team ' s history , and , if the cards broke right , Nickerson Field would be sold out . Best of all , thousands more in the New England area would be getting their first pleasant glimpse of the new upstarts and the fans might soon be clamoring at the wickets for tickets . " I thought for a while the Breakers ' luck would be with us , " said Bob Caporale , another co-owner . " The weather forecast had been bad for two days , and the first thing I did when I got up at 6:30 was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard before going to bed was that it was going to be pouring rain by morning and it wasn ' t . I said to myself , Boy , we ' re going to do it again ; the rain ' s going to hold off . ' " Not quite . The rain held off until about 20 minutes before kickoff , dwindling the crowd from the 12,636 tickets sold to a cozy 7984 in the stadium . As the rain worsened , so did the Breakers , and the fumbles and interceptions and breaks that had gone Boston ' s way through the last four games now went to Oakland . It was not a good game ; it was poorer TV . " Of course , " Caporale would admit , " I would have liked to have had the Tampa or the Denver game on television . But you can ' t control those things , so all you can do is come back from adversity - and we ' ve shown that we can do that . " What the Breakers have yet to show is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far for three games would add up to one poor game at the gate for the Patriots , and history has shown that neither rain , sleet , snow nor dough have kept fervent fans from their appointed rounds with their favorite team . If the Breakers are assuming that football fans - in Boston , of all places - will just show up to watch a new league , they may learn otherwise . The fans have to be pushed , pulled and lured in by clever promotions , sharp action and finely-tuned marketing even if the team is a winner . Even then , the Breakers should cross their fingers . The Breakers are a much better team that what you saw yesterday . In time , the team , combined with sharp promotion and spiffy marketing , may be too large for Nickerson Field . In the meantime . . .
