Maude waves to her fellow musicians , who have the bodyguards in attendance and are afraid to wave back . &nbsp; MAUDEWhen the ambassador leaves everything changes . The government ca n't officially sanction parties . The Cambodian Ambassador enters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gray " peoples " uniform , and acts with great reserve . He addresses everyone in English . &nbsp; AMBASSADORWelcome to here on this glorious night of mixing of peoples .

Especially welcome Miss oh Miss Guillory who has so  --  30  --  much helped us . The hospitality of the Cambodian peoples urges your things . Lie down ! And good night . Polite applause . He shakes hands with Maude and Rob and ostensibly retires for the night . As if someone had blown a whistle , a table filled with all sorts of bizarre food and liquor is wheeled into the ballroom . The noise level rises considerably , and everyone relaxes . All around , people are drinking and then smashing their glasses , a Cambodian custom . Members of the Quintet eat live fish gleefully . Rob and Maude approach the liquor table . Before them are three bottles -- one with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green liqueur , the third with a blue . &nbsp; MAUDEOh , they told me about this . This is balanga , the national drink . &nbsp; ROBWhich one ? &nbsp; MAUDEAll three . First you drink the red , which burns , then you drink the green , which stops the burning but makes the blood in your temples pound , then you drink the blue , which stops the pounding and makes you think you 're at Angkor Wat . &nbsp; ROBWhat if you only drink the blue ? &nbsp; MAUDEIt wo n't work . It 's like sex : you have to have foreplay , then intercourse , then afterglow . You ca n't have just afterglow . See ? &nbsp; ROBYes . . . Pok Pot lines up three small glasses , and fills each with a different liqueur . He downs the red and throws the glass over his shoulder , breaking it ; then he downs the green and breaks that glass . After both drinks , he has a look of panic on his face , but when he tosses down the blue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses for Maude and Rob . &nbsp; MAUDEOh , thank you .  --  31  --  &nbsp; ROBWatch it . &nbsp; MAUDEOh , do n't worry . I have a wooden leg . &nbsp; ROBI think you mean hollow . At least I hope so . They each drink the red , reacting in pain , and smash the glasses ; then the green , which makes them beg for mercy and smash the glasses ; finally , they quaff the blue , and all becomes serene .  --  32  --  &nbsp; ROB ( Sincerely ) You are very beautiful . &nbsp; MAUDE ( Just as sincerely ) So are you . Before this has a chance to get maudlin , Pok Pot and his quartet begin playing bluegrass in the center of the ballroom . He motions to Maude to join them . &nbsp; POK POTMiss Guillory ! Miss Guillory ! She joins them , and the Quintet plays a zippy bluegrass number culminating in Pok Pot singing Hank Williams . You Ruined My Life in perfect Tennessee dialect .

The camera pans to other inanimate objects shaking : a  --  36  --  tiny framed picture , a music stand , and , finally , as their breathing intensifies , a small vase with a flower in it falls and breaks . When they come up for air : &nbsp; MAUDEGee , for a little guy , you 're sure passionate . Rob looks into space with a smile .

Opposite them , around a sofa , are Mickey and her baby , her parents , and a battery of lawyers from her firm , including Oliver Cushing III . Both groups are very formal and incredibly intimidating , and Rob 's choice of entrance could n't be more inappropriate . &nbsp; ROB ( Under his breath ) Je-sus . INT LOFT : ANOTHER ANGLE Rob enters , quickly turns off the recorder and lets the balloons drift to the ceiling . &nbsp; ROBGee , Barkhas , the place really looks great . Barkhas grunts . Rob tries to kiss his wives , but they resist .  --  138  --  &nbsp; CUSHINGOn behalf of my client , Mrs. Robin L. Salinger , I hereby initiate divorce proceedings and to sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendant 's working life , or a percentage of his eventual net worth -- whichever is greater --  &nbsp; MR . MUHLISONPardon me , counsellor , without forfeiting first claim against defendant 's lifelong assets , my client , Mrs. Robin L. Salinger , also wishes to institute divorce proceedings on the same grounds --  Maude hands Barkhas her baby , walks over to Rob . She stares at him for a moment , then slaps him hard in the face . He turns away to face Mickey who slaps him just as hard . This signals both women to start belting him with whatever articles they can lay their hands on . We can hear only snatches of dialogue : &nbsp; MICKEYBigamist ! &nbsp; MAUDELiar ! &nbsp; MICKEYCheat ! &nbsp; MAUDEHow could you ! &nbsp; MICKEYYou left me ! &nbsp; MAUDEI want to kill you ! &nbsp; CUSHINGLadies , please ! &nbsp; EZRAMickey , Mickey --  ! &nbsp; BARKHASAwww , let ' em go . &nbsp; MICKEY12,500 --  ! &nbsp; MAUDEYou said you left her !  --  139  --  &nbsp; MICKEYShe loved you ! We both did ! &nbsp; MAUDEHow could you do this to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MICKEY -- Your daughter ! They hit him until they are exhausted . Rob has protected himself pretty well and is n't bleeding , though he is slightly bruised . He comes up for air . &nbsp; ROBI just had an idea . Maybe we should all move in together . They start to pummel him again . &nbsp; CUSHINGRob , how could you ! At a time like this ! &nbsp; MUHLISONCruel , inhuman --  ! &nbsp; MICKEYHeartless --  &nbsp; MUHLISONThe laws of this state --  ! &nbsp; ROBWait a minute , wait a minute ! ! Could I ask one thing ?

I 'm not insane . Just give me a couple of minutes . You 'll have plenty of time to get them riled up again when I 'm through --  &nbsp; MICKEYIt 's all right with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They go . Barkhas and Ezra carry the babies . &nbsp; MAUDEWell ? &nbsp; ROBLook , you two like each other , do n't you ? &nbsp; MICKEYI love Maude . &nbsp; MAUDEMickey and I have become very close in the last seven days . &nbsp; ROB ( Quietly ) That 's why we should move in together . &nbsp; MAUDEThis is n't funny , Rob . &nbsp; ROBBut people live in different ways all over the world ! Maybe monogamy 's right for some people and maybe something else is right for others . &nbsp; MICKEYWe 're not interested in how people live in the United Arab Emirates , Rob ! &nbsp; ROBBut look : I love you both , I love the children , you love the children , the children love us , you love each other . I just realized it -- we 'd be incredibly happy !  --  141  --  &nbsp; MAUDEYou 're forgetting one thing . &nbsp; ROBWhat ? &nbsp; MICKEY &amp; MAUDEWE HATE YOU ! &nbsp; ROBOh , but that 'll pass . &nbsp; MAUDEIt 'll pass ? She hits him on the shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Mickey hits him . &nbsp; ROBOkay , months maybe , lotta months . But you ca n't spend the rest of your lives hating me or you 'll never have a life of your own . &nbsp; MICKEYBut do n't you understand what you did to us ? &nbsp; ROBWell , on the good side , I fathered two beautiful kids . On the bad side , I deceived you . &nbsp; MAUDEDamn right ! &nbsp; ROBFor. . .7 1/2 months . I should n't have done it -- but I did n't know what else to do ! But look : It was only 7 1/2 months . I mean , we 're gon na live another 35-40 years , our kids 'll live 95-100 years if we can get them to take all those megavitamins . What 's 7 1/2 months compared to 5 entire lifetimes ! If you can forgive me for 7 1/2 months , we can have an amazing life together !  --  142  --  &nbsp; MICKEYThere is the creepiest kind of logic to all this . &nbsp; ROBWell , I love you ! &nbsp; MAUDELet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , we love each other , we all love the kids and the kids love us , and we 'll probably forgive you and go back to loving you , all 5 of us should move in together ? &nbsp; ROB ( It 's so simple ) Yeah ! &nbsp; MICKEY ( On his side ) See ? &nbsp; MAUDEYou 're deranged .

So that we could have the children we wanted . It was sort of chivalrous of you . Incredibly stupid but sort of chivalrous . And you were really concerned that we did n't get hurt . I can do that Rob -- I can forgive you one week of incredible anger for a lifetime together . We may have to make some changes , but --  &nbsp; ROBOh , Mickey , I 'll make any changes you want ! He embraces her . &nbsp; MAUDEBoy , you two are really married . are n't you . Rob and I were just newlyweds . &nbsp; MICKEYWell , why do n't you think it over , Maude . You do n't need to make up your mind right away . &nbsp; ROBYes , think it over , Maude . &nbsp; MAUDEI do n't need to think it over ! The thing is , I need somebody , and so does my son , but it does n't have to be you just because we 're biologically hooked up !
