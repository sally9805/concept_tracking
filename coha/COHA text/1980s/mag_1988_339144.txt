The tidal wave of grief that followed the murder of John Lennon on Dec. 8 , 1980 , flowed from several sources . Perhaps the most gaping of these was the shocking obliteration of a decade 's worth of hope . Millions awoke one morning bleak with the promise of winter to learn that now the Beatles could never get back together , that the expansive spirit of the ' 60s had definitively expired ten years past its prime . <P> But there were other , more pertinent reasons for mourning Lennon 's passing . He was not simply the megastar founder of a legendary rock group but a demonstrably troubled man who seemed to be in the process of beating back his demons . After five years of mysterious silence , he had released a new album , Double Fantasy , on which he and his wife Yoko Ono alternately performed love songs . Suddenly Lennon was dominating the airwaves again with his hit single from the album , Starting Over . And he was talking to reporters , telling interviewers about his life as a househusband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young son Sean . That he should be cut down at the beginning of this new flowering , two months after his 40th birthday , just when he was starting over , seemed an intolerable irony . <P> It still does , of course ; nothing can change the harsh reality of Lennon 's death . But Albert Goldman 's controversial new biography offers unsettling evidence of how thoroughly John and Yoko distorted the messy details of their lives for public consumption . Apparently the mythmaking machinery was working overtime during the fall of 1980 . For one thing , the much heralded marriage was on the rocks and headed for worse . Yoko told a confidant of her plans to divorce her husband after the work on Double Fantasy was completed : " I need to free myself of the Lennon name . " Her tender contributions to that album were inspired not by John , as everyone was led to believe , but by a man named Sam Green , her lover of the moment . And Lennon 's tales of cozy domesticity in the Dakota , his Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six years of research and interviews ; servants handled the baking and child minding while John either nodded off or padded about the place naked and drugged to his eyeballs . <P> Goldman deserves considerable credit for making such sordid , depressing material compulsively readable . The Lives of John Lennon is a far more balanced and objective biography than his Elvis ( 1981 ) . Goldman , a pop-culture maven and former professor of English at Columbia University , had no sympathy for Presley or for the gospel , country and rockabilly traditions that fused in his music . Much of Elvis crouches at the level of a self-conscious hipster poking fun at a greaseball bumpkin.
