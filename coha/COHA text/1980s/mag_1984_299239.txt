Changing Israel <P> To the Editors : <P> I am an American Jew who is an ardent supporter of Israel and at the same time a proud and thankful American . So long as Israel remains a democracy , those problems you so correctly reported WORLD , July 9 will be resolved . <P> Eric O. Harpman <P> New York City <P> I have just returned from doing anthropological research in Israel and found your story on the complexities of that country 's society accurate . But there are two issues oh which Israelis are united : Jerusalem and the West Bank . Never again will Jerusalem be divided , nor will Arab guns point down into the Plain of Sharon from the West Bank hills . <P> Richard V. Weekes <P> Houston <P> Israelis should get out of all Arab lands . Then the U.S. could sever the umbilical cord that links us to Israel in a relationship that costs us so much money and gives us so much trouble in dealing with other nations . <P> Anthony A. Cordova <P> New York City <P> I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels that U.S. aid is causing Israel to lose its independence . He should know that many Americans resent the billions given to his country from our taxes . An alien theocracy is the antithesis of American democracy and all it stands for . <P> Donald Conklin <P> Palatine , III . <P> Roving Jackson <P> Jesse Jackson NATION , July 9 is not the diplomat he thinks he is , and he never will be until he can tell the difference between diplomacy and being used . <P> Dennis Rainwater <P> Noble , Okla . <P> <P> I resent the negative reporting of Jesse Jackson 's Central American tour . It is time someone traveled abroad to represent those of us who are dismayed by the Administration 's Central American policy . It is apparent Jesse Jackson 's " disruptive diplomacy " is the only diplomacy that is achieving results . <P> Susan Smith Melton <P> Boston <P> I would not vote for Jackson for President , but I am glad we have him . The U.S. played a major role in coups in Guatemala and Chile , not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no love for Communism , but our support of dictators is appalling . Jackson forces us to see with a fresh perspective . <P> Philip J. Russell <P> Corte Madera , Calif . <P> <P> Jackson successfully negotiated the release of nearly 50 prisoners from Cuban jails . This deed stamps him as a deft , skilled diplomat whose finesse in sensitive dealings with foreign nations is worthy of special commendation . Jackson should be considered for the Nobel Peace Prize . <P> Milton Mazo <P> Sunrise , Fla . <P> <P> I am glad that someone has the guts to fight for his beliefs peacefully . If there were more people like Jesse Jackson in the Administration , we would be talking with the Soviets . <P> Kelly Rhuda <P> Mahopac , N. Y. <P> <P> I am shocked by what Jackson is saying and doing against my country . It is infuriating to know that someone will stoop so low as to take advantage of freedom of speech to make critical remarks about the U.S. in an unfriendly country . <P> Stella Woodall <P> Junction , Texas   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
