txt Inside every clown , they say , is an actor who wants to play Hamlet . In George C. Scott we seem to have a heavy who wants to be funny . The actor is starring in Noel Coward 's " Present Laughter , " and he 's obviously amusing himself and his audiences . Not that Mr. Scott is the ideal Noel Coward leading man  --  far from it . But he has cleverly substituted his own energy and sense of theater for Mr. Coward 's suave manner and acerbic wit . One could quibble Theater " Present Laughter " " The Death of Von Richthofen as Witnessed From Earth " with several things in this production : the butler ( Jim Piddock ) , for instance , pals around with his master in a way that no respectable British butler would deign to do , and the Swedish maid ( Betty Henritze ) is closer to a Carol Burnett caricature than a Coward creation . Never mind . This is an entertainment so disarmingly funny critical questions have to be flung aside . " Present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hero , Garry Essendine , is a performer who , like Mr. Coward in real life , is surrounded by hangers-on , among them an actress many times his junior ( Kate Burton ) , an ex-wife ( Elizabeth Hubbard ) , the predatory wife of his director ( Christine Lahti ) and Roland Maule ( Nathan Lane ) , a marvelously nutty playwright who is determined to turn Essendine into a tragedian . At the center is Essendine , eternally amusing and eternally vain ( the walls of his rooms are solid mirrors ) . He claims he wants nothing more than to have these people leave him alone , but once they are gone , wants them back . The set for " Present Laughter " by Marjorie Bradley Kellogg is vintage art deco , complete with black piano topped with a fringed shawl , and Ann Roth 's costumes are smart ' 30s . Mr. Scott . who has also directed , guides the players with gusto ; Mr. Lane especially is hilarious as the young playwright . In the lead , Mr. Scott is having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvelous evening of midsummer madness . * * The boulevard comedy of Mr. Coward is light years away from the new play at the New York Shakespeare Festival 's Public Theater . Written and directed by Des , who also composed the score , the play has the heavy-handed title of " The Death of Von Richthofen as Witnessed from Earth . " The Von Richthofen of the title is the legendary Red Baron , the German flying ace of World War I who downed 80 Allied planes before being shot down . The scene is France and takes place in the last 24 hours of his life . Profligate is the word for the production , which apparently cost half a million dollars . On one side of the set , designed by Douglas W. Schmidt , is the sand-bagged trench with the two Australian gunners who will eventually down Von Richthofen ; on the other is the elegant 18th century room which Von Richthofen ( John Vickery ) uses as his headquarters . In the war-torn noman's-land between , planes fly in , piano players rise and fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screens , and all manner of things levitate . In many cases , Mr. 's effects are ingenious and his ideas imaginative . The play opens , for instance , with an English flier ( Robert Westenberg ) suspended in mid-air . His plane has just been shot from under him , and he is dropping to earth without a parachute , but he has time on the way down to pause and sing " All IWanted Was a Cup of Tea . " The notion of stopping time  --  of postponing death before our eyes  --  is the stuff of which exciting theater is made . The other word for " Von Richthofen , " however , is inchoate . Mr. 's play could have been about many things : for example , a vivid panorama of the mindlessness of wars in the 20th century . He juxtaposes grim scenes of death with English music hall numbers which joke about killing and maiming . We soon discover , though , that there is no grand design to these juxtapositions  --  no ironic edge such as one finds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many echoes here ) . Rather than a general comment on war , the play could have been about Germany during and after World War I. Hermann Goering ( Bob Gunton ) appears and so does a mustachioed lance corporal ( Mark Petrakis ) meant to be a future Hitler . There is some vague suggestion that if Von Richthofen had accepted the responsibility of leading Germany after the war , Nazism could have been avoided . On a different level , the play might have been the personal story of Von Richthofen . There is a moment in the last part when it looks as if Mr. might make this work . Von Richthofen has a conversation with a woman  --  the first really human encounter in the play  --  and then sings a song about the actress Sarah Bernhardt , explaining that she kept performing mainly to meet the demands of her public . The clear suggestion is that Von Richthofen must keep flying to meet similar demands . But this idea , too , soon goes up in the smoke of exploding shells and downed airplanes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the flier in the opening scene , looking not for a cup of tea , but for a clue as to what has happened .
