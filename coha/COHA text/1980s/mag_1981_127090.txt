Ever since he came into the NFL in 1977 , and especially since he took over at quarterback for Fran Tarkenton in 1979 , Minnesota 's Tommy Kramer has been routinely feeding the masses with one fish and one loaf . // He has put miracle points on the board in all kinds of situations , including game-winning passes with 1:38 , 0:17 and 0:13 remaining . On three other occasions , Kramer-led two-minute drills have resulted in decisive field goals by Rick Danmeier with 25 , four and zero seconds left . And his 46-yard pass , which was tipped several times and finally caught for a touchdown by Wide Receiver Ahmad Rashad as time ran out , not only beat the Browns 28-23 and put the Vikings in the playoffs last season , but also won a place in the annals of Bobble Ball . // Whether Kramer can part the seas and get the Vikings into the Super Bowl this year remains to be seen . But the way he directed last Sunday 's easier-than-it-reads 25-10 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Bloomington showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kramer and his epic cast of receivers are right . // The win put the Vikings a game ahead of the Bucs in the NFC Central Who were you expecting to see in front , already , the Chicago Bears ? Since 1970 , only Green Bay ( 1972 ) and Tampa Bay ( 1979 ) have interrupted the Vikings ' domination of the Central , and the Bucs , who upset the Eagles in ' 79 , are the only other division team to have gotten past the first round of the playoffs. // Minnesota has always deserved a better fate than to be mired in the wild and not-so-wonderful NFC Central . The name of Viking Coach Bud Grant , the noted duck hunter , will forever be preceded by " taciturn , " but that does n't mean " inflexible . " He scrapped his celebrated people-eating 4-3 defense this season in favor of a 3-4 that better utilizes his linebacker strength . And he was wise enough to turn his offense into a circus with ringmasters like Tarkenton and now Kramer. // The Kramer variation resembles a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's far from the great bomb-throwing tradition that , for one , got Terry Bradshaw to four Super Bowls , but times have changed . The dizzying number of zone defenses in use today  --  Tampa Bay tried alignments of 4-1-6 and 3-3-5 on Sunday  --  are less effective against the dink dink dink rhythm of Kramer 's short passes . And the Vikings ' offense is also geared to make use of today 's more mobile tight ends , like their own Joe Senser , already among the best at his position and getting better . // Perhaps most important , Kramer has kept all of his eager pass catchers happy . " You ca n't help but walk around here with a smile on your face , " says Wide Receiver Sammy White , a smile on his face . // The offense was at its best on Sunday , when it controlled the ball for more than 40 minutes . " Our offense got rigor mortis standing around , " said Tampa Bay Coach John McKay , who once again out-quipped Grant but did n't beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second half and could actually start rushing the ball once in a while ( Ted Brown carried 31 limes for 129 yards , both career highs ) like a normal team . // " I had to do some blocking today , and I 've got a headache , " said Senser , whose usual role is closer to that of a wide receiver . " I 'm going to have to ask somebody about that . " // If Senser asks his quarterback , Kramer will probably say , " Joe , I was just taking what the defense gave me . " That 's how Kramer answers most questions about the complicated attack concocted by Offensive Coach Jerry Burns and overseen by Grant . But Kramer knows more , much more , than he 's letting on . // Grant and his scouts knew exactly who was needed to replace Tarkenton when they picked Kramer ahead of Glenn Carano , now a backup at Dallas , and Vince Ferragamo , now a backup in , gulp , Montreal , in the 1977 draft . " Look , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 've had some misses , too . Anytime you start thinking you 're a genius , you 're in trouble . " // But one of Kramer 's assets was that he did think he was a genius , or at least he had no doubts that he could replace a legend . " Tommy 's strong point was that he was n't in awe of Francis in any way , " says Rashad . " He just wanted to take right over . " Kramer showed the way he was thinking as a rookie when he sat down at the previously all-veteran preseason card game and said , " Deal me in . " The vets did . // He stayed in Tarkenton 's shadow for two years without loud complaint , but finally intimated that he might stay away from camp if Tarkenton did n't make up his mind to retire before the 1979 season , which Tarkenton did . Now guys like Linebacker Matt Blair wear T shirts bearing the slogan : TOMMY KRAMER , THE BEST FROM THE WEST . // A smiling , Skoal-chewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playboy reputation ; Charley McKenna of the Minneapolis Tribune dubbed him 494 Tommy because of his familiarity with the watering holes along that interstate in Minneapolis . Kramer says he has settled down somewhat , thanks in part to his new girl friend , Carrie Baudler. // " I do n't go out like I used to , " says Kramer , " but it never affected my play anyway . When we 're winning , everybody shuts up about it . Hey , my father who coached football at Texas Lutheran for six years was strict on me when I was growing up . Maybe I was just making up for lost time . " // Which is what Kramer appears to be doing with the Viking offense , to which he contributed 228 yards and one TD passing on Sunday . On one second-quarter possession he completed all nine of his passes , while driving the Vikings 95 yards for a touchdown and keeping the ball for more than nine minutes . The Bucs never recovered from the TD , which gave Minnesota a 13-0 lead . // Kramer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's game , sometimes throws quickly , sometimes off-balance , sometimes on the run , sometimes strangely , but most of all he throws often . One Viking play calls for him to pump-fake a screen to Running Back Rickey Young , look toward Senser who is wildly waving his arms in the right flat as if he 's the intended receiver ( " I like to do a little acting out there " ) , and then throw a screen to Brown over the middle . This elaborate gem is called Fake Double Screen 3-Check Middle , if you 're scoring . // Such Looney Tunes plays have been mated with the careful selection of players to build a potent offense . The drafting of Kramer was one example , but also remember that Rashad was somewhat of a reclamation project , having been traded twice before the Vikings got him cheap just before the ' 76 season started . This year has been an eye-opening one for him because he has finally found a custom pair of contacts to fit his huge eyes . " Man , I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have all kinds of information out there . " // White , the other wide receiver , was passed over by everyone at least once in 1976 before the Vikes got him in the second round . And Terry LeCount , who plays often in three-wide-receiver situations , was picked up on waivers from San Francisco . // Brown , the all-purpose heir apparent to Chuck Foreman , was chiefly a runner at North Carolina State and never heard from the Vikings before the 1979 draft . But Grant and his aides had been quietly studying films " of every pass he ever caught in college " to determine if he could fit into the system . Oh , could he ! He 's leading the NFC in receptions with 60 and averaging almost four yards per carry . // Senser , a sixth-round 1979 pick from West Chester ( Pa . ) State , is the real surprise . As the NFC 's third-leading receiver , with 49 receptions , he has already lost his no-name status ; his wrong-name status should go soon , too . " People are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Grant . // Despite their poor postseason performances ( 9-11 , including 0 for 4 in Super Bowls ) , the Vikes are the class of their not-so-classy division . Who can catch them ? // Tampa Bay may have the personnel , but it is startlingly erratic . Detroit has Billy Sims plus an 0-6 record away from the noisy , artificially turfed Silverdome . Chicago , despite a 16-13 win over Kansas City on Sunday , has internal problems , and Walter Payton must be wondering if he can survive the woeful blocking the Bears are giving him . Perhaps the Packers ' two-game winning streak  --  they beat the Giants 26-24 Sunday  --  signals a new challenge for the Vikings . After all , Green Bay Coach Bart Starr went out and pleaded with the fans for support and now appears to have his own cheering section . // Grant , of course , has so far resisted cheerleading . Otherwise , he would most certainly be shaking his purple pompons for Two-Minute Tommy .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
