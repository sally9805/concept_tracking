Is it a dream ? No . It is the last morning of our eight-day trip through the Grand Teton National Park and Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming . For four years we had thought of taking such a trip , and now we were very glad that we had. // Our horse-trekking adventure started almost two weeks earlier with our flight from Boston to the Jackson Hole Airport , by way of Denver . We were met by a group of cowboys and a friendly young woman , Becky , sent from the Rimrock Dude Ranch near Cody. // // The Rimrock is owned and operated by native Wyomingites , Glenn and Alice Fales , who have been running these trips for four years . The trips are organized by Pat Dickerman , author of ' ' Farm , Ranch &; Country Vacations , ' ' who is a horse-trekking enthusiast herself. // Our first stop is to buy cowboy hats in Jackson , a small Western town with wooden boardwalks and outfitter stores . Then , we drive past the famous Elk Reserve outside town to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turpin Meadow is an old historic ranch north of town , right next to the Buffalo River . With direct access to the trail head , it ' s the perfect spot for pack trippers starting the Jackson-to-Cody ride and for those like us , who reverse the trip by starting their wilderness ride in Cody and ending at the ranch in Jackson. // After a hearty breakfast the next morning , Becky takes us by van to Rimrock Ranch , 180 miles away in Cody , giving us a six-hour tour of Yellowstone National Park on the way. // Rimrock Ranch lies in a picturesque , sage-covered , red-stone basin at the edge of the Shoshone National Forest and Grand Teton National Park . This will be our base camp for the next three days , during which time we ' ll get used to western saddles , neck reining , and the high altitude ( over 7 , 000 feet ) . On horseback , we explore the surrounding mountain area and come to admire the sure-footedness of our horses. // We also have time to visit the Buffalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Shoshone River , so aptly named ' ' Stinky River ' ' by Indians for its sulfuric smell . There ' s time to make friends with the other ranch guests , most of them families who have come from different parts of the world . And we meet the five other members of our pack trip , all ' ' city slickers ' ' or ' ' city wimps , ' ' as the cowboys call us. // The morning finally arrives , when , after saying goodbye to our friends who remain at the ranch , we are driven some 40 miles farther into the Shoshone wilderness to the trail head , where the outfitter is . We are now seven ' ' guests ' ' and a crew of three : a guide , a wrangler , and a camp cook , with Ivy , her Labrador retriever. // The crew are experienced at packing , horsemanship , and public relations . Most of them have grown up in or lived in this area a long time . They ' re full of stories and folklore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn how to saddle a horse , pack a mule , set up camp , and even prepare some of the finest meals ever cooked in cast iron Dutch ovens either buried under embers in the ground or cooked over an open fire. // For a pack trip , in addition to the 10 saddle horses for the trekkers and crew , 10 or 12 mules and horses are needed to carry the food and camping gear - or to act as backup saddle horses , should a horse become lame. // When we arrive at the trail head , the excitement rises . Horses are chosen from the outfitter ' s herd , gear stowed , saddle bags packed with personal items such as cameras and binoculars , rain gear tied on to the saddle , and water bottles filled with mountain spring water. // Finally we mount up and set out , feeling a bit like pioneers in the ' ' Old West . ' ' As we close the last corral gate , we leave all signs of civilization behind . Before us stretches a narrow trail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column of riders and horses picks its way through the Walsaki wilderness , which leads into the Teton Mountain area . From there we follow the south fork of the Shoshone River . The trail climbs gradually , leading through forests and along steep slopes . Far below , the river cuts its ribbon path through the valley . Before stopping for lunch on a dried-up edge of a riverbed , we cross the river and wait for the slower-moving string of pack mules to catch up. // Our first night ' s camp is at a place called Needle Creek . The site meets the three most important criteria for a good campsite : a large open area of grass on which the horses and mules can graze , a location close by a creek or river , and an area as safe as possible from bear or mountain lion visits. // We normally stop around 4 or 5 in the afternoon to set up camp . After the mules are unloaded and the horses unsaddled and unbridled , they are let go to graze . While the crew sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributes our gear , we pitch our small tents and roll out comfortable ground mats and warm sleeping bags , all supplied by the outfitter . With a refreshing wash in the icy stream we are ready for dinner . A sample meal is roast beef , potatoes , vegetables , and freshly baked biscuits , with fresh fruit salad and Jell-O cooled in the ice-cold stream. // Afterward , we sit around the open fire sipping hot drinks and watching the slow progress of the grazing horses - and later the deer as they quietly edge their way into camp at dusk . Evening is very peaceful. // Without radio , television , telephones , newspapers , or the need for money , we gradually become completely at one with the environment , keeping an eye out for wild animals , not wanting to miss anything . Our senses are keenly alive - yet at times our minds wander , as we simply reflect on the grandeur of the view. // As the trip progresses higher and deeper into the wilderness , we find different types of terrain , trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunrises and sunsets are never the same ; each has a breathtaking beauty all its own , often painting nearby mountain walls a vibrant orange or red. // On a mountain trail along a catwalk by Silver Creek Falls , we surprise a black bear with two cubs drinking from the river . Off the mother goes , with her cubs scrambling up the loose rocks after her . The trail stretches on to Marsten Creek and through Bliss Creek Meadow , which got its name from a horse thief who was caught and buried there. // The eight-day pack trip is planned to allow for one day of riding on the trail with the pack mules , then setting up camp for two nights to allow for a ' ' layover ' ' day . This day gives the riders the opportunity to take a lunch and explore the surrounding area on foot or horseback . The layover day also gives the crew time to spend on jobs in camp and to reshoe any horses that may have thrown shoes - which happens quite often in this rough terrain. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail leading through spots with names that conjure up images of wagon trains and Indian scouts , we are rudely thrust back into civilization , as we round a bend and see telephone lines in the valley below . The roofs of the Turpin Meadow Ranch are off in the distance . With a final lope through a field of sagebrush to the ranch , our pack trip comes to an end. // Vivid memories remain . Camping by streams and in meadows ; horses grazing contentedly ; campfires and delicious food ; steep mountain trails ; sounds of horses ' hoofs along with the slap and creaking of leather saddles ; fresh smells of spruce and sagebrush ; deer , bear , elk , and moose in the wild - all make us long for a return trip to the Wyoming wilderness. // // Practical information : // For more information about this trip or other ranch and/or pack trips write or call Adventure Guides Inc. , 36 East 57th Street New York , N.Y. 10022 , telephone ( 212 ) 355-6334 , or your travel agent. // // // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
