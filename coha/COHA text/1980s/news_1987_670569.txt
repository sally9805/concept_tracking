Palms and assorted foliage sway under the breeze of big room fans ; lacy , multicolored shawls hang from ceiling pipes ; eccentric old lamps flicker in every corner ; antique furniture mixes with white wicker chairs and porch swings suspended from the ceiling . Add to this potpourri Oriental rugs , vintage posters , lace-covered tables and crystal chandeliers and you have one of the most intriguing settings in New York - just a short walk from the Broadway theater district . Jezebel , a black-owned soul-food restaurant , is noteworthy not only for its authentic food but also for its ultra-stylish mixed crowd. // The four-year-old restaurant is the creation of Alberta Wright , a former antiques dealer who swapped sideboards for Southern-fried chicken . When she decided to open the restaurant and had to choose a decor , it seemed only natural to bring her treasures with her. // Even the waitresses have a period look about them - although sometimes it ' s difficult to figure out what period - decked out in everything from slinky cocktail dresses to flowing peasant skirts . Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Service is absent-minded and exasperatingly slow , especially when the place fills up , which is usually twice nightly , at the 6 and 9 P.M. seatings . ( If you have theater tickets , though , they make a point of getting you out in time . ) I have never seen so many birthday parties in a restaurant - one evening I counted seven - and the staff spends an inordinate amount of time serenading revelers at their tables . Perhaps they should allow the piano player to sing " Happy Birthday " and let the waitresses tend to more pressing business. // The soul-food menu is as unalloyed as anything you will find uptown , and much of it is inviting . Start with the superior corn bread , which is moist and crumbly and minimally sugared , and the fresh baking-powder biscuits . Smothered garlic shrimp is one of the better appetizers , the shrimp cooked to a turn and the zesty red sauce crackling with hot pepper . Rib bits , little hacked-up morsels of sweetly coated pork ribs , are habit-forming ; chicken livers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soups sampled , my favorite was the Pinesville ( peasant ) cow pea made with small beans resembling lentils and a richly flavored stock . Charleston she-crab soup was unusual but appealing , a frothy broth packing lots of fresh crab flavor and lightened with cream. // Main courses are portioned for field hands , so go lightly on appetizers and bread . You can get a fine fried chicken here , crisply fried outside , succulent and mildly peppery , flanked by deliciously fresh collard greens and run-of-the-mill potato salad - I preferred that to the spiced honey chicken , which , while competently cooked , was a little too sweet for my taste . Yet a third poultry preparation is chicken with waffles , a late-night Harlem tradition harking to the Jazz Age . Late-night revelers would stop at such all-night haunts as Wells on 133d Street for a plate of this sobering combination . At Jezebel , it is smashing : a portion of good roast chicken under pan-dripping gravy alongside fluffy , golden waffles with butter . I held back on the maple syrup , however. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-modern yuppie palaces around town . The falling-off-the-bone braised meat comes in a brassy sauce generous with cayenne pepper , along with rice , beans and collard greens . Smothered pork chops tasted as if they had been cooked a bit too long , for the meat had a flabby , bready texture under its thick gravy ; the accompanying okra was good but the grits were mushy , as if they had been reconstituted . A better choice was the roasted Cornish hen filled with a pleasantly sweet apple-raisin stuffing. // Two shrimp dishes are worth trying : one an aggressively spicy Creole recipe , the other featuring a fiery garlic sauce with rice , cauliflower and zucchini . The less adventurous can get the skillfully broiled salmon steak with black-eyed peas . ( It comes with an adhesive brick of macaroni and cheese that will revive memories of school cafeterias . ) Jezebel has a small , standard wine list . Beer and bourbon go well with this type of food. // One would expect first-class sweet-potato pie here , but what came out was a loosely bound and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unequivocal dessert winner - crusty , studded with raisins and sweetened with Grand Marnier . Light and creamy chocolate cheesecake is satisfying , and strawberry shortcake , made with those light fresh biscuits , is the real thing. // Jezebel is an original , for sure ; an exhilarating spot filled with energy , style - and calories . <> <> JEZEBEL ** // 630 Ninth Avenue , corner of 45th Street , 582-1045. // Atmosphere : A vast room filled with antiques and bric-a-brac .
