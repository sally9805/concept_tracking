Theologian Karl Earth 's last letters mix vitriol , compassion <P> He was typecast for the role of European professor : hair askew , glasses perched precariously on nose , rumpled suit flecked with bits of tobacco from an omnipresent pipe . At the University of Basel , where he taught for 27 years , students adored him . But amiable Karl Barth was anything but indulgent when he talked of man 's relationship with God . <P> In his epochal commentary on St. Paul 's Epistle to the Romans , after World War I , Barth thundered that the biblical God was " wholly other , " powerful , mysterious . Man 's task was to reshape himself to God 's design , rather than the other way around . Almost singlehanded he established what came to be known as " Neo-Orthodox " theology , demolishing the 19th century-style liberalism that had tried to domesticate the Deity . During the next several decades , in his 9,000-page Church Dogmatics , he sought to make God 's nature and activity a bit more accessible to mortals . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public figure . In 1934 he drafted the creed of the anti-Nazi " Confessing Church , " which organized German Protestantism against Hitler 's puppet church . That same year he was fired from his professorship at the University of Bonn for refusing to take the ritual faculty pledge of allegiance to Hitler . Returning to his native Switzerland , the archfoe of Nazism often perplexed Westerners-including America 's Reinhold Niebuhr-with his live-and-let-live attitude toward Communism . <P> Fascinating facets of Earth 's life and thought have been revived in the English edition of Letters 1961-1968 ( Eerdmans ; 382 pages ; $18.95 ) . Written late in his life , the 325 letters are full of typical Barthian barbs directed at the Allies ' policy of rearming the West German " empire " and " the rabid mob of anti-Communists . " Among the aging theologian 's enthusiasms : Mozart ( Barth proposed him for beatification ) , American Civil War battles , and the contemporary U.S. , which he visited for the first and only time at age 75 ( " a fantastic affair " ) . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compassionate when everyday folk asked for spiritual advice . To a German prisoner contemplating suicide : " Regarding your prayers . How do you know they are in vain ? God has his own time , and he may well know the right moment to lift the double shadow that now lies over your life . " <P> Publicly , Barth kept berating the West for its nuclear buildup and its cold war mentality . But privately , as the book reveals for the first time , he wrote to fellow-traveling Czechoslovak Theologian Josef Hromdka , saying : " My hair stands on end " at the concept of " freedom and peace " through " Nikita , Mao and even Fidel . " Hromdka 's association of the Christian Gospel with the political cause of Communism , he said , was a mirror image of the sin committed by Niebuhr and other anti-Communist " Western fathers .
