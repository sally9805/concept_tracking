Though Moscow 's move will hurt , the mood is still upbeat <P> The unofficial name for the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles is the Capitalist Olympics-so called because every cent of the $475 million budgeted to stage them has come from private sources , primarily U.S. corporations . But as every capitalist knows , the " invisible hand " of Adam Smith 's marketplace economy not only provides bounteous rewards , it is also perfectly capable of delivering a sucker punch . It was far too early to tell whether the Soviets , in leading an East-bloc boycott of the Olympics , had landed a solid shot or a glancing blow on the 30 corporate sponsors , 54 Olympic licensees and hundreds of others who had sought prestige and profit through the Games . But the mood in Los Angeles was , for the most part , defiantly upbeat . Declared Harry Usher , executive vice president of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee ( L.A.O.O.C. ) : " We wo n't go into the red . " <P> The impact of a Moscow pullout will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union or its satellites to provide more than a tiny fraction of the 600,000 tourists expected to visit Los Angeles during the 16 days of Olympic competition . The big question was whether popular U.S. interest in the Games , abetted by one of the most intensive publicity campaigns ever mounted for a sports event , could be sustained with so many star performers missing . On the answer rode millions of dollars in sales of everything from air fares to souvenir trinkets , as well as the largest sum ever bid for the right to cover a sports event on television . <P> Most of those with a direct stake in the success of the Games were understandably eager to remain publicly optimistic . Said Stanford Blum , who lost money as an Olympic licensee in 1980 after the U.S. decided to boycott the Moscow Games but who is now back in business in Los Angeles : " It was almost unpatriotic for American merchandisers to promote items after the U.S. boycott . That certainly wo n't be the case in Los Angeles . " <P> Corporate sponsors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million to $15 million apiece to the L.A.O.O.C. and could not back out even if they wanted to , also put the brightest possible face on the boycott . Said Steve Leroy , media manager for McDonald 's Corp. , which spent $4 million building the Olympic swim stadium on the U.S.C. campus : " For every dollar we 've spent , we expect the public to be aware that we have this type of commitment to sports . The program already has been a big success . " <P> Still , there were nagging doubts . " Everybody 's putting on a brave face , but I think it does matter whether or not the Russians come , " said Brian Harlig , co-owner of Good Time Tickets , one of four major ticket outlets in Los Angeles . His Olympic sales slacked off noticeably after Moscow 's announcement . Los Angeles City Councilman John Ferraro was more alarmed by the Soviet boycott : " It could hurt our Games tremendously .
