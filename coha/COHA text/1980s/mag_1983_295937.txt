Unwilling to take no for an answer , the mayor re-enters Chicago 's race <P> In the days of the all-powerful Democratic machine-that is , for nearly all of the past half-century-Chicago 's mayoral elections generated about as much suspense as the drying of paint . No more . When Windy City voters choose a mayor three weeks from now , leaders of the national Democratic Party and black communities all over the country will be watching not just with interest but with more than a tinge of apprehension . The election has turned into a test of how much power blacks can exercise by working within the Democratic Party , their political home since early New Deal days . <P> The issue , unmistakably , is whether white Democrats will vote in large enough numbers for a black candidate who is carrying their standard . Congressman Harold Washington , 60 , won that designation on Feb. 22 , when he unexpectedly triumphed in the Democratic primary . He took only 36.3% of the vote , nearly all from blacks who had registered in record numbers . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates : Incumbent Mayor Jane Byrne , 48 , and State 's Attorney Richard M. Daley , 40 , son of the mayor who ran the city machine with an iron fist until his death in 1976 . <P> In Chicago , a city where Republicans are so heavily outnumbered that they have captains in only a few hundred of the 2,914 precincts , the primary should have ended the race . But this time the Democratic organization and its official candidate did not exactly hurry to embrace each other . Only half of the 50 ward committeemen endorsed Washington , who declared that he would not " grovel " for their support and pledged during the primary campaign to strip the machine of its muscle , city hall patronage . Park District Superintendent Edmund Kelly went so far as to endorse Republican Candidate Bernard Epton , 61 , a millionaire lawyer who had some slim hope of profiting from the dissension to become the first G.O.P. mayor elected since 1927 . And then last week Mayor Byrne suddenly upset all the calculations by announcing that she would re-enter the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington 's nomination not just a white but a white Democrat to select as an alternative . <P> It was a startling reversal for Byrne , who had pledged her support to Washington the day after losing to him in the primary and as late as March 1 scoffed that a write-in campaign " could n't be done . " Though there were grim cracks that she had launched a " white-in " campaign , Byrne stoutly insisted that her decision " has nothing to do with race . I 'm not running for blacks or whites or the Democratic Party or the Republican Party or any political organization . I 'm running for Chicago . " In fact , she seems to be running for her political life . Her imperious and erratic performance during four years as mayor so alienated machine and maverick Democrats alike that there is little possibility she will be nominated for any other office .
