It is one of the most hotly contested pieces of real estate in Japan. // The area , called Ikego Forest and situated on the edge of town here , has been the subject of signature campaigns , local referenda and snap elections , and multimedia news coverage through Japan for five years . Zushi Mayor Kiichiro Tomino and about 70 citizens even traveled to the United States last month to stage a demonstration in front of the White House and seek support from US lawmakers and environmental groups. // // They want the Japanese government to scrap its plan to build 854 homes for US Navy families on about 210 acres of an undeveloped ecosystem that , they say , is becoming unique to the ever more-populated Tokyo-Yokohama metropolitan area. // But Ikego is more than an environmental story . It is about how ordinary people view their national government and its ties with the Americans . It is also about how Zushi ' s people are dealing with their once-quiet town ' s rapid politicization and the group - largely women - that is fighting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never give up , ' ' said Mitsuyo Sawa , a Zushi city councilwoman and antihousing activist. // When the drilling for soil tests began in 1982 , Zushi homemakers noticed this unusual activity going on on the other side of Ikego ' s chain-link fence. // The plan was to build the housing facility and fence off the remaining 500 acres , reportedly because of tunnels and caves . Townspeople would be permitted anywhere in the housing development and would have access to most of the sports facilities in the complex. // ' ' We were surprised , since there had been no activity in there for so long . We gathered at the fence to see what was going on and got worried that something terrible would happen to Zushi , ' ' said Rakue Okubo , one of Zushi ' s activists . Informal gatherings at the fence led to more organized gatherings of a new group the women formed : Mamoru-Kai , or Citizens ' Association for the Protection of Greenery and Children. // Since then , Mamoru-Kai has grown speedily in sophistication and political clout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some say international - political map . They have collected tens of thousands of signatures for petitions and letters to Japanese and US officials ; won enough support for a referendum to dissolve a city council ( Japan ' s first such referendum ) ; and succeeded in recalling a mayor who supported the housing project and getting their own candidate , Mayor Tomino , elected. // The members of Mamoru-Kai , however , are up against some formidable foes . One is the Japanese government , which says construction is going ahead virtually on schedule , despite all the political developments within the town itself. // ' ' It is the central government ' s business what goes on in Ikego . This provision for housing is an important promise between our government and the US . Mayor Tomino does not have the authority to change the government ' s plan , ' ' said Hisayoshi Nishida , planning division director at the Japanese Defense Facility Administration Agency ( DFAA ) . The ' ' promise ' ' is a 1960 US-Japan agreement providing Japanese land for US military use. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper procedures to prepare the way for construction : 14 public hearings held in Zushi and nearby cities to air views ; an environmental assessment that took several years to research ; and a government compromise that reduced the area to be developed and the number of housing units from 1 , 100 to 854. // The public meetings , says Mrs. Okubo , were , however , ' ' completely unilateral . There was no discussion . They just asked for our understanding . ' ' And Catharine Nagashima described the environmental assessment as ' ' a sort of justification for going ahead . No alternatives were suggested. ' ' // But there is perhaps a tougher obstacle within the town itself : a split right down the middle of the Zushi City Council on whether or not to support the housing project . The town is by no means united behind Mayor Tomino and Mamoru-Kai. // One of the group ' s critics who is nevertheless emphatically against Navy housing in Ikego is Yoshifumi Yamato , a Zushi city councilman . He said , though the women ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its original intent was to protect the town from ' ' social problems that come from having US military people around - drugs , crime , AIDS - as well as nationality , cultural , and life-style differences. ' ' // Back in 1984 , Yamato said , ' ' Someone . . . thought of taking up the environmental-protection issue . If they ' d said they were against social crimes , people would think Zushi is arrogant or prejudiced , so they hid behind the environment issue. ' ' // Some of the social concerns appear to remain , even within Mamoru-Kai . Members maintain that they fully support the US-Japan security treaty , and in fact some say the Navy families should be integrated into the community and live just as Zushi people do - the way some US families do in NATO countries . But they also admit to some concerns about that. // ' ' There are some people who fear bad influences , but most people are worried about life-style and cultural differences , ' ' Okubo said . ' ' A few Americans coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' but large numbers can change the town . I had American next-door neighbors once . We had very good conversations and I really liked them , but I don ' t really want to be surrounded by foreign people . I know it ' s a bad aspect of us Japanese - we have one language and one culture , so we don ' t really feel at ease living with other cultures. ' ' // Though Mamoru-Kai members say that most of the town at least mildly objects to the Navy housing for environmental or social reasons , there is another school of thought as well , one that represents Japan ' s political mainstream . Some Zushi people are fatalistic : The government plan is going ahead , they say , so why fight it and thus tarnish the city ' s image ? // Akira Odani is part of that camp . What the protesters are doing ' ' is not democracy at all , ' ' he said . Because two-thirds of the heads of Zushi households work elsewhere and are not full-time residents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the environmental activists. // But one city council member , Mr. Yamato , who is neither a fatalist nor a environmentalist , says the most important reason to protest the housing project is Japan ' s national interests. // ' ' I accept the ( US-Japan ) treaty , but the Japanese people ' s feeling has changed since it was signed , ' ' Yamato said . ' ' It ' s not really bilateral : The US makes requests , and Japan has to agree . But the Japanese people have made great progress since 1960 , so it has to be more balanced. ' ' // All this controversy , however , is accomplishing some notable things : a grass-roots political movement which is inspiring other local protests in Japan and which is also led by women ; some environmental consciousness-raising in a country that lacks any national conservation laws ; and high voter turnouts in a once-apolitical bedroom community. // ' ' Ikego represents one of the most creative , dynamic grass-roots environmental movements we ' ve seen in this country , ' ' said Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' They ' re testing a lot of systems here . And all this is being spearheaded primarily by women. ' ' // //
