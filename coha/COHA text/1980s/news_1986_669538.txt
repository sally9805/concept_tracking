The townspeople don ' t mind occasionally moving City Hall , because asbestos is the reason for Asbestos ' existence . Thousands of asbestos miners form the backbone of the local economy . Here , and in nearby towns like Thetford Mines , mine waste rock forms the foundations for roads , new homes , and schools. // // But the outlook for the town is cloudy . The material asbestos has been widely condemned in the United States as dangerous , and the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) is considering banning it completely . Such a move , claim people here , threatens the very existence of their community. // ' ' The ban is based on politics , ' ' says miner Fernand Trembly through an interpretor . ' ' People are crazy to be worried about asbestos that is locked in a product . ' ' Mr. Trembly explained that in his 30 years at the mine the working conditions had improved considerably . ' ' I can walk through the mine in a dark suit , and you won ' t see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a smile. // David Dull of the EPA views the situation differently . ' ' There is an enormous amount of evidence available in the scientific literature that shows that asbestos presents a very significant ( health ) risk . . . both in the workplace and the ambient environment. ' ' // The Asbestos Institute , the focal point of Canada ' s support of the asbestos industry , agrees on the potential health hazard of uncontrolled asbestos , especially on workers subjected to high and prolonged exposure before current standards were established . Cases of the disease have been documented in studies of textile workers using asbestos fabric , and in wartime shipyard workers who sprayed asbestos as insulation. // It is on the issue of the potential risk from short-term and low-level exposure that the EPA and the Asbestos Institute differ. // The Canadians , and a number of other countries and international organizations , are taking strong measures to control asbestos in the workplace , but are less concerned with exposure in the general environment . Canadian officials claim that there is simply no evidence showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk . They point out that asbestos is present everywhere in the world environment and that studies conducted on the communities of Asbestos and nearby Thetford Mines indicate no excessive health problems. // The EPA has listened to the Canadians , but US officials remain unconvinced by the merits of their arguments . ' ' I don ' t want to suggest that we are indifferent . . . to the concern of the Canadian miners , ' ' says Mr. Dull , who is deputy director of EPA ' s Chemical Control Division . ' ' But our primary duty is to look at the risks presented by asbestos in the US and to make a decision based upon our perception of those risks and whether they can be dealt with at reasonable costs. ' ' // EPA estimates the risk to be 1 , 000 cancer-related deaths over the next 30 to 40 years if the ban is not implemented . The ban will cost $2 billion , according to the EPA , but American companies that depend on asbestos say the figure will be at least double that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question on the health impacts of asbestos substitutes , the Canadians wonder why the US wants to spend $2 million to $4 million ' ' per life saved ' ' and destroy an entire industry in the process. // From a public-health viewpoint , says one expert commenting on the proposed US ban , ' ' more lives and years might be saved by investing in antismoking campaigns , anti-alcohol campaigns , transportation safety , or other public measures. ' ' // Americans know little about asbestos other than its reputation as an extremely dangerous material . Made from the same mineral as beach sand , the name asbestos refers to six different types of mineral fibers found throughout Earth ' s crust . The term comes from the Greek word meaning unquenched , which was applied to minerals that resisted fire. // Asbestos is used in dozens of products , including cement , floor tile , and automobile brake pads , because it resists wear and tear , high temperatures , corrosive chemicals , and microorganisms. // Dull does say that asbestos ' ' is a naturally occurring material and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probably from natural sources . ' ' He also concedes that there are no actual data from human studies that link asbestos at low exposure levels to disease , primarily because such a study would require several hundred thousand people even to begin to document. // Without hard data , EPA has relied on calculations to determine that asbestos added to the environment by mining , or by products containing asbestos , seriously increases the risks to the general population . But Dull says the EPA is looking at new information ' ' to see whether it still supports the original calculations we put forward. ' ' // The Asbestos Institute is also raising questions on the substances that would replace asbestos , including : cotton , mineral wools , carbon and ceramic fibers , and fiber glass . Their research says not enough is known about substitutes to assert that they are safer than asbestos. // In response , EPA has initiated a major research effort but says the preliminary health information on the substitutes looks much better than the known health risks associated with asbestos . Dull also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would allow the use of asbestos in certain products if a suitable substitute can not be found. // ' ' If you put experts in a room , ' ' Dull says , ' ' they will come out with different conclusions about some of the fine-tuning aspects of risk , . . . which can lead to different arguments about the best regulatory approach that you ought to take . . . . It ' s a tough problem to decide when to go ahead with the information you have or wait for more studies . In the case of asbestos we think the balance has tipped against it.
