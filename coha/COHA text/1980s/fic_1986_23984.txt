IN SEARCH OF THE RATTLESNAKE PLANTAIN By Margaret Atwood We start in from the shore , through the place where there are a lot of birches . The woods are open , the ground covered with a mat of leaves , dry on the top , pressed down into a damp substratum beneath , threaded through ( I know , though I do n't look , I have looked before , I have a history of looking ) with filaments , strands , roots , and skeins of leaf mold laid through it like fuses , branched like the spreading arteries of watercolor blue in certain kinds of cheese . Against the dun color of the fallen leaves , which recedes before us , the birches stand out , or lie , Birches have only a set time to live , and die while standing . Then the tops rot and fall down , or catch and dangle  --  widow-makers , the loggers used to call them  --  and the lopped trunks remain upright , hard fungi with undersides like dewed velvet sprouting from them . This patch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always gives me the same feeling : not fright , not sadness ; a muted feeling . The light diffuses here , as through a window high up , in a vault . " Should have brought a bag , " says my mother , who is behind me . We go in single file , my father first , of course , though without his ax , Joanne second so he can explain things to her . I come next and my mother last . In this forest you have to be close to a person to hear what he says . The trees , or more probably the leaves , blot up sound . " We can come back , " I say . Both of us are referring to the birch bark , curls of which lie all Margaret Atwood 's new collection of short stories , Blue-beard 's Egg , will be published by Houghton Mifflin in November . around us . They ought to be gathered and used for starting the fire in the wood stove . With dead birches , the skin outlasts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . There is no moment of death for anything , really ; only a slow fade , like a candle or an icicle . With anything , the driest parts melt last . " Should have used your brain , " says my father , who has somehow heard her . They have the ability to hear each other , even at a distance , even through obstacles , even though they 're in their seventies . My father raises his head without turning his voice , and continues to stomp forward , over the dun leaves and the pieces of Greek temple that litter the ground . I watch his feet , and Joanne 's , ahead of me . Really I watch the ground : I 'm looking for puffballs . I too have brought no bag , but 1 can take off my top shirt and make a bundle with it if I find any . " Never had one , " says my mother cheerfully . " A ball of fluff . Just a little button at the top of my spine , to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind me . " Where 's he going ? " she says . What we 're doing is looking for a bog . Joanne , who writes nature articles , is doing a piece on bogs , and my father knows where there is one . A kettle bog : no way in for the water , and no way out . Joanne has her camera , around her neck on one of those wide embroidered straps like a yodeler 's braces , and her binoculars , and her waterproof jacket that folds up into its own pocket and straps around the waist . She is always so well equipped . She brought her portable one-person kayak up for this visit , assembled it , and whips around over the water in it like a Jesus bug , which is what they used to call those whirligig water beetles you find sheltering in the calm places behind logs , in bays , on stormy days , black and shiny like Joanne 's curious eyes . Yesterday Joanne stepped the wrong way into her kayak and rolled , binoculars and all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as we could ; the binoculars are more or less all right . I knew then that this is the reason I am not as well equipped as Joanne : I am afraid of loss . You should n't have a kayak or binoculars or anything else unless you 're prepared to let it sink . Joanne , who is bright and lives by herself and by her wits , is ready for anything despite her equipment . " They 're only binoculars , " she said , laughing , as she squelched ashore . She knew the address of the place where she would take them to get them dried out professionally if all else failed . Also she had a spare pair of hiking boots . She 's the kind of woman who can have conversations with strangers on trains with impunity . They never turn out to be loonies , like the ones I pick , and if they were she would ditch them soon enough . " Shape up or ship out " is a phrase I learned from Joanne . Up ahead my father stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoops too but she does n't uncork the lens of her camera . My father scuffles impatiently among the dried leaves . " What 's he got there ? " says my mother , who has caught up with me . " Nothing , " says my father , who has heard her . " No dice . I do n't know what 's happened to them . They must be disappearing . " My father has a list in his head of things that are disappearing : leopard frogs , certain species of wild orchid , loons , possibly . These are just the things around here . The list for the rest of the world is longer , and lengthening all the time . Tigers , for instance , and whooping cranes . Whales . Redwoods . Strains of wild maize . One species of plant a day . I have lived with this list all my life , and it makes me uncertain about the solidity of the universe . I clutch at things , to stop them , keep them here . If those had been my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now , right at this moment , I ca n't remember which thing it is that must be disappearing , or why we are looking for it in the first place . We 're looking for it because this is n't the whole story . The reason I ca n't remember is n't creeping senility : I could remember perfectly well at the time . But that was at the time , and this is a year later . In the meantime , the winter , which is always the meantime , the time during which things happen that you have to know about but would rather skip , my father had a stroke . He was driving his car , heading north . The stroke happened as he turned from a feeder lane onto an eight-lane highway . The stroke paralyzed his left side , his left hand dragged the wheel over , and the car went across all four lanes of the westbound half of the highway and slid into the guardrail on the other side . My mother was in the car with him . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a miracle we were n't mashed to a pulp . " " That 's right , " I say . My mother ca n't drive . " What did you do ? " This is all going on over long-distance telephone , across the Atlantic , the day after the stroke . I am in a phone booth in an English village , and it 's drizzling . There 's a sack of potatoes in the phone booth too . They do n't belong to me . Someone must be storing them in here . My mother 's voice fades in and out , as mine must for her . I have already said , " Why did n't you call me as soon as it happened ? " and she has already said , " No point in upsetting you . " I am still a child , from whom the serious , grown-up things must be concealed . " I did n't want to get out of the car , " my mother said . " I did n't want to leave him . He did n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if we were having any trouble , and drove on and called the ambulance . " She was shaken up ; how could she not be ? But she did n't want me to fly back . Everything was under control , and if I were to fly back it would be a sign that everything was not under control . My father was in the hospital , under control too . The stroke was what they called a transient one . " He can talk again , " said my mother . " They say he has a good chance of getting most of it back . " " Most of what ? " I said . " Most of what he lost , " said my mother . After a while I got a letter from my father . It was written in the hospital , where they were doing tests on him . During the brain scan he overheard one doctor say to another , " Well , there 's nothing in there anyway . " My father reported this with some glee . He likes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . are past the stand of dying birch , heading inland , where the undergrowth is denser . The bog is somewhere back in there , says my father . " He does n't remember , " says my mother in a low voice to me . " He 's lost . " " I never get lost , " says my father , charging ahead now through the saplings . We are n't on a path of any sort , and the trees close in and begin STORY 69 to resemble one another , as they have a habit of doing , away from human markings . But lost people go around in circles , and we are going in a straight line . I remember now what is disappearing , what it is we 're supposed to be looking for . It 's the rattlesnake plantain , which is a short plant with a bunch of leaves at the base and knobs up the stem . I think it 's a variety of orchid . It used to be thick around here , my father has said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't want one of these plants for anything ; if he found a rattlesnake plantain , all he would do is look at it . But it would be reassuring , something else that is still with us . So I keep my eyes on the ground . We find the bog , more or less where it was supposed to be , according to my father . But it 's different ; it 's grown over . You can hardly tell it 's a bog , apart from the water that oozes up through the sphagnum moss underfoot . A bog should have edges of moss and sedge that quake when you walk on them , and a dark pool in theup using . But she is a good guest . There are no rattlesnake plantains here . The rattlesnake plantain does not grow in bogs . it 's summer again and I 'm back home . The Atlantic lies behind me like a sheet of zinc , like a time warp . As usual in this house I get more tired than I should ; or not tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before and go to sleep early , never knowing what year wake up in . Will it be twenty years ago , or twenty years from now ? Is it before I got married ? Is my child  --  ten and visiting a friend  --  grown up and gone ? There 's a chip in the plaster of the room where I sleep , shaped like a pig 's head in profile . It 's always been there , and each time I come back here I look for it , to steady myself against the current of time that is flowing past and over me , faster and faster . These visits of mine blur together . This one , though , is different . Something has been changed , something has stopped . My father , who recovered almost completely from the center , of water brown with peat juice . It should remind you of the word tarn . This bog has soaked up its water , covered it over and grown trees on it , balsam six feet high by now . We look for pitcher plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is mature . Joanne takes a few pictures with her top-of-theline camera and never-fail close-up lens . She focuses on the ground , the moss ; she takes a footprint filling with water . We stand around , slapping mosquitoes , while she does it . We all know that these are n't the pictures she 'll endstroke , who takes five kinds of pills to keep from having another one , who squeezes a woolen ball in his left hand , who however is not paying as much attention to his garden as he used to  --  my father is ill . I 've been here four days and he 's been ill the whole time . He lies on the living room sofa in his dressing gown and does not eat or even drink . He sips water , but not more . There have been whispered consultations with my mother in the kitchen . Is it the pills , is it a virus of some kind ? Has he had another stroke , a tiny one , when no one was looking ? He 's stopped talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to listen very carefully or you ca n't catch what he 's saying . My mother , who has always handled things , does n't seem to know what to do- I tell her I 'm afraid he 'll get dehydrated . I go down to the cellar , where the other phone is , and telephone the doctor , who is hard to reach . I do n't want my father to hear me doing this : he will be annoyed , he 'll say there 's nothing wrong with him , he 'll rebel . I go back upstairs and take his temperature , using the thermometer I used to check my fertility when I was trying to get pregnant . He opens his mouth passively to let me do this ; he seems uninterested in the results . His face , a little one-sided from the stroke , appears to have shrunk and fallen in upon itself . His eyes , under his white eyebrows , are almost invisible . The temperature is too high . " You have a temperature , " I tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl of icetells me . " He says there are some trees he has to finish cutting . " " It 's the temperature , " I say . " He 's hallu-cinating . " " I hope so , " says my mother . " He ca n't drive up there . " Maybe she 's afraid it is n't the temperature , that this is permanent . I go with her to their bedroom , where my father is packing . He 's put on his clothes : shorts and a white short-sleeved shirt , and shoes and socks . I ca n't imagine how he got all of this on , because he can hardly stand up . He 's in the center of the room , holding his folded pajamas as if unsure what to do with them . On the chair is an open knapsack , beside it a package of flashlight batteries . " You ca n't drive at night , " I say . " It 's dark out . " He turns his head from side to side , like a turtle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't know what 's holding you up , " he says to my mother . He looks baffled . cubes to him , because he says he ca n't swallow . The ice cubes are something 1 remember from my childbirth classes , or could it be my husband 's ulcer operation ? All crisis is one crisis , an improvisation . You seize what is at hand . " Did he eat the ice cubes ? " says my mother , in the kitchen . He does n't hear her , as he would have once . He does n't say no . Later , after dinner , when I am rereading a bad Agatha Christie dating from the war , my mother comes into my room . " He says he 's going to drive up north , " she O. A- ?

He wants out , he wants to drive , away from all this illness . " You should wait until tomorrow , " I say . He sets down the pajamas and starts looking through his pockets . " The car keys , " he says to my mother . " Did you give him an aspirin ? " I ask her . " He ca n't swallow , " she says . Her face is white . Suddenly she too looks old . STORY 71 mother are off in the woods somewhere , trudging through the undergrowth , young balsam and hazelnut and moose maple , but Joanne and I ( Why ? How did we get separated from them ? ) are going along the shore , on the theory that , if you 're on an island , all you have to do is go along the shore and sooner or later you 'll hit the point you started out from . Anyway , this is a shortcut , or so we have told each other . Now there 's a steep bank , and a shallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logs , big around as a hug , their ends sawed off clean . These logs are from the rime when they used to do the logging in the winter , cross by the frozen lakes , cut the trees and drag them to the ice with a team of horses , and float them in the spring to the chute and the mill in log booms , the logs corralled in a floating fence of other logs chained together . The logs in this bay were once escapees . Now they lie like basking whales , loll. ing in the warmed inshore water , Jesus bugs sheltering behind them , as they turn gradually back to earth . Moss grows on them , and sun-dew , raising its round leaves like little greenish moons , the sticky hairs standing out from them in rays of light . Along these sodden and sprouting logs Joanne and I walk , holding on to the shoreside branches for balance . They do the logging differently now ; they use chain saws , and trucks to carry the logs out , over gravel roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoreline , though , they leave enough for the eye ; but the forest up here is becoming more and more like a curtain , a backdrop behind which is emptiness , or a shambles . The landscape is being hollowed out . From this kind of logging , islands are safer . Joanne steps on the next log , chocolate brown and hoary with lichen . It rolls in slow motion , and throws her . There go her second pair of hiking boots , and her pants up to the knees , but luckily not the camera . You ca n't never trust nobody , " says Joanne , who is laughing . She wades the rest of the way , to where the shore slopes down and she can squelch up onto dry land . I pick a different iog , make a safe crossing , and follow . Despite our shortcut , my parents get back first . In the morning , the ambulance comes for my father . He 's lucid again , that 's the term . It makes me think of lucent : light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opaque . In his husky , obscure voice he even jokes with the ambulance attendants , who are young and reassuring , as they strap him in . " In case I get violent , " he says . The ambulance does n't mean a turn for the worse . The doctor has said to take him to Emergency , because there are no beds available in the regular wards . It 's summer , and the highway accidents are coming in , and one wing of the hospital is closed , incredibly , for the holidays . But whatever is or is not wrong with him , at least they 'll give him an intravenous , to replace the lost fluids . " He 's turning into a raisin , " says my mother . She has a list of everything he 's failed to eat and drink over the past five days . I drive my mother to the hospital in my car , and we are there in time to see my father arrive in the ambulance . They unload him , still on the wheeled stretcher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a space that excludes us . My mother and I sit on the leatherette chairs , waiting for someone to tell us what is supposed to happen next . There 's nothing to read except a couple of outdated copies of Scottish Life . I look at a picture of wool dyeing . A policeman comes in , talks with a nurse , goes out again . My mother does not read Scottish Life . She sits bolt upright , on the alert , her head swiveling like a periscope . ' ' There do n't seem to be any mashed-up people coming in , " she says after a while . " It 's the daytime , " I say . " I think they come in more at night . " I ca n't tell whether she 's disappointed or comforted by this absence . She watches the swinging doors , as if my father will come stomping out through them at any minute , cured and fully dressed , jingling his car keys in his hand and ready to go .
