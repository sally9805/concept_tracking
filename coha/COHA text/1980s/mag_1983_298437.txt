<P> As the campaign nears the end , Kohl 's prospects improve <P> <P> Helmut Kohl , 52 , was suffused with optimism last week as he and senior election strategists huddled over breakfast in Bonn 's chancellery . With only three weeks remaining until West Germany 's March 6 national elections , the tall , affable leader was considering some heartening news . According to a poll published in the weekly magazine Der Spiegel , Kohl 's Christian Democratic Party and its ally in Bavaria , the Christian Social Union , were leading the rival Social Democrats 49% to 42% . Those figures marked a 1.5% rise in the popularity of Chancellor Kohl 's conservative grouping from the previous week , and an almost identical decline for the Social Democrats . Said Kohl : " Things are now going in our direction . " <P> The Chancellor is still far from victory in West Germany 's volatile and , perhaps , pivotal election campaign . The stakes include not only the Chancellor 's office , but the direction of West German foreign policy and possibly even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campaign has progressed , the electorate has become increasingly polarized over the placement of U.S. Pershing II and cruise missiles on West German soil . A poll for Der Spiegel published a week ago showed that approval of the so-called two-track NATO strategy of deploying the missiles , while simultaneously pursuing arms talks with the Soviets , has jumped from 38% to 51% among Christian Democratic supporters . At the same time , however , approval among Social Democrats declined from 37% to 26% . <P> Before Kohl called the elections more than four months ago , hardly anyone could have predicted that West German politics would have become so muddled . Though the Social Democrats had been in office for 13 years , their popularity had reached a low of 27.5% , compared with 54% for the Christian Democrats . The Social Democrats were tired and tattered by factional disputes centering on Chancellor Helmut Schmidt 's pro-NATO defense policy and his management of the economy . When Kohl and the Christian Democrats took office in October , some Social Democrat leaders predicted that their demoralized party would recover only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election campaign began , however , Kohl 's rosy political prospects started to fade . First , a wave of sympathy began to build for the defeated Schmidt , whose term of office ended when the small , centrist Free Democratic Party deserted his coalition to join Kohl 's conservative alignment . Then Kohl faced a voter backlash for the way he arranged the election call , by stage-managing a vote of confidence against himself in the Bundestag . That maneuver has been contested by four Bundestag members before West Germany 's Constitutional Court . <P> <P> Paradoxically , Kohl has also suffered from his brief period of incumbency . With monthly business failures hitting an alltime high of 1,257 in December and an unemployment rate of 10.2% , many voters are blaming Kohl for failing to arrange a quick upturn in the economy , though the new Chancellor has had little time to make much difference in the face of unavoidable economic difficulty .
