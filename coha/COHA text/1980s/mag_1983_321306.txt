The cruel vagaries of weather <P> Without rain there can be no crops . Without crops there is no food , no money and ultimately no hope . For millions of people on four continents this summer there is very little hope . <P> From India to South Africa , from Brazil to the Philippines , the vicious cycle of drought is having a devastating effect . Bush fires have scorched the arid ground in Ghana and Liberia ; in Brazil hot winds from the east have made the desiccated ground still dryer . Some 2 million people are seriously undernourished in South Africa ; 3 million in Ethiopia are totally dependent on emergency supplies . In India , where crops throughout 75% of the land have been ruined by a dry spell that in one state has lasted five years , Prime Minister Indira Gandhi has had to spend $600 million in precious foreign-exchange reserves for food imports this year alone . Indonesia , which finally achieved self-sufficiency in rice last year , will need to import 2 million tons of rice this year at a cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crop surplus that it exported food to twelve African nations in 1981-82 , is this year for the first time reportedly requesting $25 million in food aid . <P> Meteorologists suspect that droughts in India , Mexico , southern Africa and the Philippines are attributable to El Nio , the Pacific current that may also account for this spring 's record rains in California . But El Nio does not explain the aridity of northeastern Brazil , where rainfall this year is running at one-eighth its normal rate . In most afflicted areas , paralyzing dryness is , alas , endemic . Explains Roman Kintanar , president of the World Meteorological Society : " What we have right now is just one of the vagaries of weather . " <P> All the parched countries face the same sad pattern . Along the " Street of Sickness " in northern Brazil 's sweltering market town of Irauuba , a family of twelve huddles in a two-room shack , hoping to survive on the $22 a month it receives from the government . The reason : with no vegetation to eat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some villagers in India are reduced to chewing grass , sucking the roots of herbs and scrambling alongside animals to lap up water that spills out of pumps . In drought-plagued areas of the Philippines that have seen outbreaks of locusts , even those pests have been sold for food . Millions of Africans are aching through a dry spell perhaps less severe but certainly more widespread than the harrowing drought of 1973 , which killed more than half a million . Refugees throughout these afflicted areas are often packed so tightly into camps that contagious illnesses spread swiftly and fatally . Kwashiorkor , a protein-deficiency disease , is sweeping through the infant population in South Africa 's black rural areas , but many people can not raise the $3.50 hospital admission fee .
