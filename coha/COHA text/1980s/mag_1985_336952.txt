DIED . Jeanne Deckers , fiftyish , former Dominican Sister Luc-Gabrielle who , as Belgium 's " Singing Nun , " became an unlikely international pop star of the 1960s with her 1963 No. 1 hit Dominique , a 2 million seller , as well as other songs whose treacly lyrics were redeemed by her catchy melodies and high , pure voice ; by her own hand ( she and her female roommate took an overdose of barbiturates ) ; in Wavre , Belgium . Deckers left her order in 1966 to pursue success in the secular world , but it had already passed her by ; the home she set up for autistic children recently closed for lack of money , and Belgian authorities were demanding payment of back taxes on her song earnings , which were taxable even though she had given them all to the church .
