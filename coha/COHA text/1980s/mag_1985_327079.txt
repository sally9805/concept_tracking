In March 1951 , Time Inc . Editor-in-Chief Henry Luce directed that from then on at least one color page should appear in every issue of TIME . Four-color photographs had made their debut in the magazine years before Luce 's decree ( in a 1934 survey of U.S. Depression-era painting , including Grant Wood 's classic , American Gothic ) . But color was expensive , not always accurate and + required such a long time from photo to printed page that it was used only to illustrate feature stories . <P> Over the ensuing years , as the technology of both photography and printing improved , TIME 's commitment to color grew . By 1975 TIME was running two or three color pages per issue , though most of that was still for early-closing stories . In 1977 the magazine made a decision to push strongly into the world of four-color news photography . By 1979 TIME averaged twelve pages of color ; in 1982 , 18 . Last year there were 24 color pages per issue , not counting more than 100 " bonus " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Olympics , the political campaigns and the elections . <P> In 1985 , nearly 34 years after Luce decided his magazine needed color , TIME is taking the ultimate step : it will be essentially an all-color magazine  --  the only such newsmagazine . Says Managing Editor Ray Cave : " As technology has made color illustration economically feasible , we have maintained a firm commitment to moving toward a four-color magazine . Now , except when there are no satisfactory color pictures of a news event or deadlines that can not be met , we will illustrate virtually all of the magazine in color . " <P> One of the key figures in this decades-long transformation is Picture Editor Arnold Drapkin , who was hired in 1951 to help start TIME 's new color projects department . " When I began , " he recalls , " color photos had to close five weeks before their appearance in the magazine . Then , from the mid- ' 50s to the late ' 60s , I flew from New York City to our Chicago printing plant almost every week because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . With today 's capabilities , if we get color pictures on a Saturday afternoon , we can have them in the magazine that goes to press Sunday morning . " This remarkable advance has required the expansion of the ranks of those dealing with color photos , from Drapkin and an editor to 30 people who supervise the handling of an average of 20,000 color pictures a week . " It is a lot more demanding to edit color than black and white , " says Drapkin . " But it certainly gives our readers a far richer and more exciting newsmagazine. "
