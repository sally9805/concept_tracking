As the nation 's best marathoners gathered in Buffalo last May for the Olympic Trials , among them was a short , 33-year-old man with a reddish beard and a squashed orange cap . Except perhaps for some manifestations of his age , he looked much like the other runners , but if only the competition could have seen Dr. Steve French in his prime ! // In fact , few of the other marathoners knew much about French , beyond that he was a surgeon from Salt Lake City . He answered their questions only as they were asked and offered no information about his past . No , he had n't run in college . His best 10-km. time ? Er , 30:30  --  in a marathon . Most of all French avoided conversation because he did n't want to reveal his feeling that he had no business being in Buffalo . // As the field surged forward at the start , French wanted to yell , " Hold it ! This is all a great mistake . All I wanted to do was lose weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1977 , what French really yearned to do was get into a pair of size-38 pants . Back then he could n't have beaten anyone in a race , except perhaps to the cookie jar . The 5 ' 8 " French had spent almost a decade imitating the Michelin Man , his weight at one time having been 226 . He simply hoped running would help him shed some pounds . Now , weighing 128 , he was one of 178 runners to have qualified for the Olympic Trials by completing a marathon in less than 2:21:54. // Three years ago , French still was waging a battle with his appetite . He would drop a few pounds , but he 'd always regain them . Finally , running seemed the only answer . " I probably lost 500 pounds and never changed weight , " he recalls . " To lose weight , you have to cut calories . I could n't whip that problem . But it occurred to me that I 'd never seen a fat person who ran five miles a day . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange thing happened while French was shedding pounds . He discovered that the talent he 'd shown as a high schooler  --  he 'd once done a 4:41 mile  --  had n't expired under all that blubber . His times began dropping as fast as his weight . Six weeks after he took to the road , he tried a marathon , with no intention of finishing , and went the distance in 3:34:43 ; the following year , after juggling his training around a 100-hours-a-week job as a senior surgical resident at Primary Children 's Hospital , he did a 2:29:10 in the mountainous Deseret News marathon at Salt Lake City ; then , last Feb. 10 , he rah a 2:18:40 in New Orleans . Suddenly other runners began to notice him . Bill Rodgers , the American record holder at 2:09:27 , said , " Dropping his time like that over such a short period would be impressive even if he 'd been thin . I ran three years in high school , four in college and two more after that before I hit 2:19. // " Obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing that out of all the runners there are now , he 'd be one of the few who break through despite imposing obstacles . There were so many things against him . Just the impact of all that weight would make him vulnerable to injury . I wonder what the difference is between this guy and the others . " // French 's habit of defying the odds might be the answer to Rodgers ' question . No one from the family of John Wesley French , a Wilmer , Texas truck driver , had ever gone to college when Steve was accepted by Texas A&amp;M . He arrived at College Station a year behind in math  --  he literally had no idea what calculus was  --  and left with a master 's degree in nuclear engineering , having earned a 4.0 average in graduate school . // But grades were the least of French 's challenges in becoming a doctor . He could n't stand the sight of blood  --  he 'd fainted when a Little League teammate gashed open an elbow . But taking care of people had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doctor despite his aversion to blood . He took his pre-med requirements while attending engineering graduate school and then enrolled in the University of Texas Medical School at Houston . In 1976 , having become a good deal less distressed by the sight of blood , he went to the University of Utah Medical Center to serve his internship in general surgery . // While driving himself through med school , French neglected both his wife and his body . His 12-year marriage to a high school sweetheart dissolved , even as his body ballooned from 125 pounds to 226 in a matter of three years . Then French hit his breaking point . " I got a pair of size-38 slacks for Christmas , and I could n't come close to fastening them , " he says . " That was ridiculous . When I entered medical school , I 'd thought there 's nothing more disgusting than a fat physician . And then I became one . " // In April 1977 French began running for the first time in 12 years . Despite the promise he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation in college track because they feared it would distract him from his studies . By 1977 that talent was nowhere in sight . French had to stop and rest just walking across the Utah campus from one class to the next . For his first run , he decided to go three miles , or 12 laps of the Highland High track . He quit halfway through the second lap . " I thought I was going to die , " he recalls . // By the end of ' 77 , French had broken three hours in the marathon . Two years later he would qualify for the Olympic Trials with a time of 2:21:32 at the Fiesta Bowl Marathon in Scottsdale , Ariz. // These days , home for Dr. French is a two-story Colonial house in Salt Lake City which he shares with a cat named Tigger and his second wife , Marilynn , a nurse . He took a leave of absence from his residency last year to see what proper training could do for him . His qualifying for the Olympic Trials was a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgical residency , he recently went to work as an emergency-room physician at Memorial Hospital of Uinta County in Evanston , Wyo. , an hour away . He has turned down offers to join private practices because , he says , they require too much time . // On a recent morning French could be found running errands around the house , followed everywhere by Tigger . He wore running shorts and no shirt ; he no longer has a gut to hide . He finally sat on the arm of his living-room couch and relaxed with a chaw of Red Man . " When I was in college I was very aggressive and goal-oriented , " he said . " I worked 99% of the time . My social life was zero , and it led to the demise of my marriage . I want to find a happy medium between my work and my other interests . " // Indeed , balance rather than zealotry seems to be a hallmark of French 's new personal philosophy . It even extends to his diet . " I 'm a week-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll eat white meat on the weekends . I 'm not a nut about it , though . I do n't break out in a rash if someone puts a steak in front of me. " // French produced a collection of pictures that show the body he used to lug around . The photos looked like the before shots in the diet-pill ads . For further proof that the man standing before his guest was really the same one shown in the snapshots , French bared a hip and revealed mazes of stretch marks . " I 've lived almost three lives , " he said . " First in high school and then the years I was fat and hated to be seen in public . Now I 've been given a second chance . " // French is still adjusting to his new life . The day before this year 's Boston Marathon , he spotted his name on the wall of Rodgers ' running store among a list of the race 's 50 most notable runners . He was delighted . He remains unaccustomed to his status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at races , " he says . // French tends to regard running rather superstitiously . Since his third race , a half marathon , three years ago , he 's never run without the orange-flowered railroad cap that has become his trademark . He also likes to take his training runs dressed in the T shirt he will wear in his next big race ; that means he has to wash it every day . And he trains as he used to eat . French logs 120 to 140 miles a week . // Such a regimen has whipped French into excellent health  --  and often poor condition for running . " My workouts take me to the brink of disaster , and I 've tumbled over a couple of times , " he says . " But I 've been aware of it . I had to be willing to take those risks . What I 've done is totally wrong . It has been too much too soon . I would never advise anyone to do what I did . But I had such a short time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last December , French ran four marathons in six months and suffered four major injuries . The week before the Fiesta Bowl he was unable to walk because of a hip injury . He calls his fastest marathon  --  the Mardi Gras  --  his worst . He ran with eventual winner Ron Tabb through the first 11 miles and passed the halfway mark in 1:06:30 , but in the final half of the race he cramped up in his calves and was forced to stop twice for a minute or longer . He nearly quit . Instead , he jogged the last 1 ? miles . // One morning the week before Boston French woke up unable to bend his right knee , which had filled with fluid . A doctor drained it , but eight miles into the race the knee stiffened up again . French finished a disappointing 75th in 2:27:39. // And so he went to Buffalo desperately wanting to break 2:15 . He thought he 'd finally done it when he hit the halfway mark right on schedule for 2:13 . But it was n't to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot became so painful that by the 17th mile he was forced to run in the grass alongside the road at a seven-minute pace . He finished 81st in 2:23:07. // It seems certain that when he 's healthy , French can go faster . To give his body a chance to heal itself , he has n't run a marathon since the Olympic Trials . The layoff has n't bothered him . After all , his body waited so long for him to get himself in order , preserving his talent all the while , that French ca n't complain if it makes him wait a bit now .
