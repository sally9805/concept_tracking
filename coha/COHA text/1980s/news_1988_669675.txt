A skinny Hispanic kid dressed in a red , white , and blue uniform jogged to the center of a Moscow soccer field . A cold rain was falling , and it was getting dark. // On a bench next to the field , waiting , were the men from the Moscow Aviation Institute . The beefy 25-year-olds are world-class athletes being trained by their government in a new sport : bezbal. // // Baseball , that is . And the skinny guy on the field , 15-year-old Danny Ortiz from Hoboken , N.J. , was there to help . He and his teammates , a streetwise gang of ballplayers , for this occasion renamed the Ambassadors , spent two weeks flying across the USSR last month . Stopping in Moscow , Kiev , and Tblisi ( the capital cities of the Russian , Ukrainian , and Georgian Republics ) , the Hoboken Ambassadors played five fledgling Soviet baseball teams . They beat all five , including the Aviators , although the boys were about half the size of their opponents. // The young Americans also showed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played , conducting joint training sessions that covered everything from batting helmets to bunting. // The Soviet government is eager to learn the all-American pastime , now that it is slated to become an Olympic sport at Barcelona in 1992 . It even has a five-year plan . Many of the finest javelin throwers , handball champions , and tennis players have been skimmed from their national teams in the last two years and thrown onto soccer fields and track courses with a hodgepodge of equipment . There are no pitchers ' mounds . Videocassettes from Cuban teams are used to explain the rules. // ' ' We broke the sticks from trees for bats and used field-hockey balls , at first , ' ' said Andrei Tselkovsky of the Moscow Chemical Institute team . A gift last year of 500 aluminum bats from the Indianapolis-based International Baseball Association helped. // The Ambassadors gave credit to the Russian players for learning so much so quickly . ' ' See you at the Olympics , ' ' Blair DeGaeta said to his opponents at the end of each game . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseman. // But although these first Soviet baseball players may make it to the ' 92 or ' 96 Olympics , Soviet sports officials say they are more likely to become the coaches of the future , as the government seeks to teach a new generation of children to love a sometimes frustrating and so far largely unknown sport. // ' ' My friends make fun of me , actually , for playing this ridiculous game with bats and balls , ' ' said Mr. Tselkovsky when he met the arriving Hoboken team. // ' ' Don ' t worry - no one likes our town , either , ' ' Francis ( Chipper ) Benway replied cheerfully. // Indeed , the Soviets found the right American team to invite . The Hoboken Ambassadors have survived tough odds , too. // Hoboken is a gritty former factory town just upriver from New York Harbor . The team , like the town , is an all-American mixture of Puerto Ricans , Dominicans , Italians , blacks , and Irish . The boys are sons of truck drivers , real estate agents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; others are on the verge of dropping out of public schools. // Hoboken was Frank Sinatra ' s hometown , and the setting for ' ' On the Waterfront . ' ' It is also home to baseball. // As the story goes , the first-ever game of organized baseball was played on Hoboken ' s Elysian Fields in 1846 . Today , a plaque on a rock in the middle of 11th Street is a reminder of the city ' s glorious baseball past. // The boys of summer in Hoboken don ' t have their own baseball field , either . Like the Soviets , they play in donated uniforms on borrowed fields . And they ' re used to road trips. // Three years ago , coaches William Culhane , Joseph Reinhard , and Walter ( Binky ) Lebhrink Jr. ( the latter two are Hoboken police officers ) scouted the Hoboken Little League teams , picked the 17 finest players , suited them up , and began crisscrossing northern New Jersey in vans and school buses to challenge other Sandy Koufax teams ( generally between Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s cool - it ' s almost like being in the pros , traveling on the bus and all , ' ' said 15-year-old William ( Chilly ) Agosto , who lives in a housing project. // Within two years , the team without a home field won its division , state , then Northeast regional championships . They were flown to Puerto Rico for the Sandy Koufax World Series , where they came in fourth. // The invitation to visit the Soviet Union came at the prompting of Sen. Frank Lautenberg ( D ) of New Jersey , who , on a visit to Moscow last year , told Soviet sports officials of the team ' s success. // The Soviet Union , team members found , was a whole different kind of road trip . The visit required eight airplane flights and more than 30 bus trips in 14 days . In Kiev , a beautiful , tree-lined city , the boys were scared to drink the water because the Chernobyl nuclear reactor is about 25 miles upstream . They were impressed by some aspects of Soviet life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations , especially the ones in Kiev , which are lined with chandeliers. // The towering concrete apartment buildings that ringed all three cities didn ' t faze them . ' ' It looks just like home , ' ' said Danny Ortiz , who lives in the Hoboken housing projects. // The greatest surprise for all the boys were the people . ' ' I thought the Army would be everywhere , ' ' said Clay Castro . ' ' I thought there would be curfews , and people would be scared to go out at night , because of the KGB . It ' s not like that. ' ' // ' ' In Tblisi the people came right up to me and wanted to shake my hand , ' ' said Michael Purvis . ' ' That shocked me . No one in America has ever just walked up to me and wanted to shake my hand , ever . ' ' Michael turned 16 while in Tblisi , and his Soviet hosts and their parents threw him a birthday party , complete with cakes. // Although communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the language . On the last day in Tblisi , the Ambassadors stripped off their gear and piled up bats , gloves , face guards , and helmets in one glorious heap near home plate . Then they dragged their Georgian hosts over and urged them with hand motions to take it all. // Danny , Hoboken ' s pitcher , tapped Georgian pitcher Alex Copa on the shoulder . He had a gleaming new baseball in one hand . ' ' Yo , watch , ' ' he said , wrapping his fingers around the ball . ' ' Look , two fingers here , and throw like this , ' ' he demonstrated . ' ' Got it ? Let ' s see it. ' ' // Danny gently corrected Mr. Copa ' s grip . ' ' You got that , ace ? ' ' // Copa nodded quickly , then spoke . ' ' Curveball , ' ' he said , then grinned and enveloped Danny in a bear hug. // //               @ @ @ @ @ @
