They did it in a prison cellblock , behind a wall guarded by armed security forces and within shooting distance of the Peruvian Navy . Outside the two-story cellblock , the guerrillas had scrawled slogans promising prolonged popular war , and on the guard tower nearby they had painted hammer-and-sickle symbols. // The prison inmates , accused of being members of the Shining Path guerrilla organization , were first taken to the offshore jail known as El Fronton four years ago . Gradually , through a combination of hostage-taking , riots and appeals on human rights grounds , they won almost total control of the main cell block and surrounding patio. // By the accounts of lawyers and others who defend them and the Government that opposes them , they created a system in which they received the visitors of their choice , did their own cooking , set up a library of revolutionary literature , swam in the ocean , gave lessons in Spanish and politics to the Indian peasants among them , manufactured simple weapons and built a network of tunnels and reinforcements to protect themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , the Peruvian armed forces asserted that the prisoners used the cellblock , essentially an open dormitory known as the Blue Pavilion , as a virtual command post to plan or coordinate actions by guerrillas active outside the jail , using visitors to carry messages. // On June 18 , when the prisoners rioted and took hostages in apparent concert with accused guerrillas held at two other prisons on the mainland , the armed forces attacked . After 20 hours of fighting - in which the prisoners used four captured rifles and a variety of homemade weapons and explosives and the military and prison guards used gunboats , helicopters , explosives and sharpshooters - more than 100 men , by counts on both sides , lay dead in the ruins . Between 25 and 30 prisoners survived by surrendering. // At Lurigancho Prison just outside Lima , the rioting prisoners went down to defeat in a few hours . Every man in the guerrilla cellblock died , a total of 124 , according to the armed forces. // A similarly timed rebellion in a women ' s prison in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two deaths , according to the Government . <> <> Planned to Move Prisoners // When the uprisings began , the accused guerrillas in all three prisons issued a list of complaints that , besides demands for improved living conditions , called on the Government to halt its unannounced policy of gradually moving Shining Path prisoners to a new maximum-security prison with individual cells . The new prison , the prisoners said , was " contrary to all human dignity , " and they demanded to stay where they were. // The Government said the prisoners resisted going to the new prison because the individual cells would inhibit their political and military planning. // Shining Path , which began military actions in 1980 , claims descent from the Communist Party of Peru . But Shining Path has rejected the more traditional Marxist-Leninist guidelines of Moscow and Havana , and while theoretically of Maoist orientation , it has also turned against Peking. // The leaders of Shining Path , mostly former university professors , originally planned an agrarian-based revolution among Quechua Indians . They intended to reach out gradually from Ayacucho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the group has begun to emphasize urban actions that attract more attention. #8 , 000 Killed in 6 Years Although its primary targets have been the police and the military , it has also been blamed for bombings and large-scale killings of peasants . At the same time , the armed forces ' counterinsurgency campaign has produced documented atrocities , with the killings by the two sides approaching 8 , 000 in six years of fighting. // What brought accused Shining Path guerrillas to El Fronton , as well as to the other prisons involved in the June 18 violence , was a series of jailbreaks that the group engineered in the Ayacucho area in early 1982 . Officials said the Government of former President Fernando Belaunde Terry had sought more secure places , where guards and the judicial authorities would feel themselves and their families less threatened. // El Fronton , which had served as a detention center from 1930 until the mid-1970 ' s , was reopened to receive the accused guerrillas. // There is general agreement between the Government ' s version of how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered by people with links to Shining Path . Where they may disagree is in explaining why things occurred as they did. // Martha Huatay , a lawyer who has represented several men and women accused of being leaders of Shining Path , said only one of her clients had acknowledged in court being a member of Shining Path . But she said the ideas they defended and their slogans and songs appeared to indicate their sympathy for the guerrilla organization . <> <> Corruption and Opportunism // Cesar Arias , a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry , said the El Fronton prisoners had been able to take advantage of the overcrowding and generally bad conditions existing in all Peruvian prisons. // " Justice is slow and corrupt , " he said . " You can ' t conduct any court transaction without having to bribe someone . The employees are poorly paid , ignorant and susceptible to corruption . By bribing them , prisoners can get anything . The result is that in the jails the prisoners run things.

As the months and years went by , she said , they won more concessions from the prison authorities , some of which she helped to negotiate. // About two years ago , she said , they won an agreement that prison guards would vacate the tower overlooking the Blue Pavilion and the patio . The only contact the prisoners had with the authorities was when civilian employees came through the gate morning and evening to open and close the door of the cellblock. // This made it possible for Shining Path prisoners to organize their lives in relative freedom . On one side , the wall kept the world away ; on the three other sides , rocky embankments dropped down to the rough ocean waves. // Another agreement , she said , gave prisoners the right to swim in the ocean as long as they did not go beyond a particular buoy .
