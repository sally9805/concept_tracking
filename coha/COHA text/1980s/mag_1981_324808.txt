FHO1172 <P> Aaah ! But a bit too good to be true ? Not at all . <P> The ad accurately depicts the appearance , personality and interests of FHO1172 , a.k.a . Suzanne Douglas . In fact , Douglas , who is founder , publisher and editor in chief of a slick , sophisticated monthly magazine called Intro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inserted the ad for herself in the March issue .

" <P> Born Susan Anne Potter in Dunsmuir , Calif. , Douglas has been thrice married and enjoyed a highly successful career as a publishing executive ( WomenSports ) before starting her own magazine sales and marketing firm in Los Angeles . In 1976 boredom tempted her to put a personal ad ( " dynamic career woman , tall , blonde . . . " ) in a cheap tabloid for singles . " My personal life was on hold , " she says . <P> To her surprise she got 90 responses , including three " real possibilities " and three marriage proposals . <P> " And then it hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine that you could have on your coffee table , one that would n't come in a plain brown wrapper . " With enthusiastic support from former publishing colleagues , Douglas spent more than a year formulating her magazine and then raised close to $2 million to launch it . The first issue , in August 1980 , ran 177 personal ads free ; the October 1981 Intro ran 1,077 personals at an average cost of $25 each .
