Here is the essential event of a sunny winter ' s afternoon in 1962 : A rather impressionable undergraduate , having flouted gravity by falling asleep with his feet on the table and his chair tilted back on its rear legs , falls to the floor of Harvard ' s Lamont Library . On the way down he has a vision . It is the image of a little boy sitting on a decrepit dock . The boy is playing a game with the surface of the water , trying to bring the soles of his bare feet as close to it as he can without touching it . So it was that Peter Leroy began his life in the mind of Eric Kraft . Since that curious birth as a daydream , Peter Leroy has " lived " a rich and varied life , for Kraft , the once-laggard freshman , never stopped thinking of the boy who came to him when he took a sprawl . Now , 21 years later , others may begin sharing the 39-year-old Kraft ' s fantasy . Last month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publishing strategy and released the first two installments of a serial novel called , " The Personal History , Adventures , and Observations of Peter Leroy . " A third adventure - all of them are in paperback - will appear in February , with subsequent installments promised every three months thereafter , ad infinitum . After the issue of every four paperbacks , Apple-wood will issue a hardcover volume containing the year ' s " Peter Leroy . " No one sees any end to it , odd as it all sounds. - There is something elusively improbable about Eric Kraft as he sits in the living room of his comfortably elegant Newburyport home . Puckishly energetic , a wry little boy ' s smile loiters on his face and makes his impeccable neatness look a tad costumed . With his precise gestures , he somehow seems suspended from the ceiling by puppeteer ' s strings . He explains how a momentary figment of his imagination years ago became not only the stuff of dreams , but of published novels . " I didn ' t start writing about Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the library , " he says matter-of-factly . " Then I started writing about him a little , learning about his friends , the town of Babbington where he lives . Soon I began accumulating notes , little scenes , snatches of conversation , bits and pieces of things that happened to him . Now there are file cabinets full of him . " He pauses for a few pleasantly modulated seconds . " It ' s just daydreaming , really , " he says . " Now it ' s been going on so long that it ' s more like reminiscing . In the novel , I just remember the events of Peter ' s life , just like Peter wouldhimself . " And so it is that Kraft reveals himself as a wonderfully eccentric novelist in the old manner , a creator of an entire world in miniature . In his hilarious , precisely literate , and somehow innocent first person , Kraft , as Peter Leroy , remembers the imaginary events of an ordinary but fictitious boyhood among the stucco houses and Studebakers of Babbington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother Takes a Tumble , " lightly recounts the strange circumstances of a romance that began with " a swindle only a college man could have dreamed up , " the second one , " Do Clams Bite ? , " confronts darkermemories . In its 95 harrowing pages , Peter recalls a fear of holding harvested clams in the front of his wool bathing suit in the manner of his grandfather ; he is afraid they bite . It sounds silly , but even as one laughs , one finds oneself strangely moved by Peter ' s descriptions of things as apparently trivial as the day his mother fell out of her lawn chair reaching for her tea . In all of this we get something wonderfully different from most literary efforts . Instead of a sparsely furnished contemporary crash pad , Kraft ' s elegant , oddly lyrical writing gives us a fantastic Victorian attic in which to poke around , even if it does take place in the suburban Long Island of the ' 50s . And if Peter Leroy ' s whimsy seems pleasantly antique , Apple- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the usual one-shot blockbuster . For Kraft , the endless format of serial publication allows him the space to include his entire vision of Peter Leroy ' s life . " Why a serial novel ? " he asks . " Because there ' s so much to write about . It ' s become a big subject , Peter ' s life , " he answers . Having said this , Kraft elaborates on his theory that there are three basic forms of fiction : " the Chinese box , the voluble drunk , and the bag of trash . " " Peter Leroy ' is a bag of trash , " he says . " It ' s roughly chronological , things get shifted around , and there are lots of different things thrown in . With the serial novel , everything fits . " ( The Chinese box , he explains , is intricately structured ; the voluble drunk just raves . ) That he finds himself writing a **27;129;TOOLONG has a deeper satisfaction for Kraft , for his life is so intertwined with that of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living without him . One begins to sense a surprising seriousness behind the nonsense . " I ' d just be so disappointed if there was ever a last Peter Leroy book , " he says . " Writing about Peter has become a consuming passion . " When asked why he has taken as his sole literary project the imaginary remembrances of an ordinary boy named Peter Leroy , Kraft ' s first retort is a wry " for fame and the love of beautiful women . " Then he murmurs thoughtfully . " No , I don ' t know . . .. " I guess , well , if you live your life by doing one thing and not something else , as we all must , you wind up living a life of singularity . . . single events , single occupations . So when you look back , you can give an account of the things you already did , or you can make up stories of things you didn ' t do . That ' s the fun of Peter . I can do things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to do myself . " And what of the real life of Eric Kraft ? Well , like Peter , Kraft grew up on Long Island , though in Babylon , not the imaginary Babbington , and like Peter , Kraft spent much time with his grandparents , for his father had been killed in World War II . " It was a nice boyhood , " he says . " It was not a childhood full of spectacular events or the stuff of fiction . " Games were played . On summer nights bottlecaps would ping across sidewalks toward targets , and the playhouse out back became a German guardhouse toward which Kraft and his friends would creep , trying not to be detected . Later this playful sensibility would become Peter Leroy ' s , as would Kraft ' s early clamming expeditions with his grandfather . " Then I met Mad , " Kraft says profoundly , glancing at his wife Madeline , whom he met at West Babylon High School and who now sits across from him in their Newburyport living room . It was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls was kindled . " It was such a romantic moment , " Kraft recalls . " She looked at me and asked me , How did you do on the college boards ? ' I told her . She swooned . " College separated them for a year , but true love knows no impediment , and they got married during Kraft ' s second February break from Harvard , where as an undergraduate he switched from studying math and physics to English . " We had a sumptuous meal at the Howard Johnson ' s on the way back , " Kraft philosophizes . After several impoverished graduate years at the Harvard School of Education - Kraft remembers that " one day we found a dollar bill and we were so excited we took the whole day off , " - he began teaching school and writing a lot of Peter Leroy in his spare moments . After a number of years in the educational publishing field , Kraft formed Kraft and Kraft , Inc. with his wife . Since then they have together written and edited textbooks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office on the second floor of their home . It is here that Kraft daydreams his way through the Peter Leroy novels , word-processing his way to fame and fortune . From the year-long calendar on the office wall which carefully notes work days , rest days , income tax payments , and " Peter Leroy deadlines " to the 5 o ' clock martinis which end each day , Kraft lives a meticulously organized life of creativity . He rises at 6:30 to stand in the kitchen reading , drinking coffee and writing in his journal before beginning work on the current Peter Leroy . " Promptly at 9 " he begins the business day . Every Sunday afternoon the Krafts meet three other Newburyport residents for their " religious " reading of Proust ' s " Remembrance of Things Past , " which they hope to complete in another 2 1/2 years . In his spare time Kraft paints rooms in their big house ( once owned by Waldo Pierce , the painter ) and takes walks with his wife through their beloved Newburyport , which Kraft describes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is one other thing . This is the " Picture of the Day " album , into which Kraft and his wife paste a photograph and a short description of each day ' s activities : Going to the post-office , insulating the pipes , Madeline reading on a couch . " The small things that happen to you disappear so quickly , " Kraft says . " I don ' t want to forget them . "
