ST . LOUIS - It did not surprise Bruce Sutter that his catcher , Darrell Porter , was named the playoff MVP . " Most people think because he ' s a quiet guy off the field , that ' s the way he is all the time , " said the relief ace . " But actually he ' s a very aggressive guy . He gets on me when I get a little lax with my fastball . He keeps me on my toes , and I ' m always aware of what the situation is . " And it didn ' t surprise Porter that Sutter didn ' t get the MVP , since , like most people , he takes for granted that Sutter will normally shut down a club like the Braves . " I ' ll tell you about Sutter , " said Porter . " When he comes into a game , it gives me a lift . It gives everybody a lift because you know he ' ll be out there giving his best and doing a job . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , even though it might be a tight situation . Our first thought is , OK , here we go . Something good is going to happen . ' " Sutter worked in two games , getting two saves . He faced 12 batters , and didn ' t allow a hit . Porter went 5 for 9 , and had five walks . Three of his hits were doubles . Sutter refused to get overly excited about winning the pennant , although he did think it was nice : " I ' ve still got a job to do in the next series . If I get it done , like I did tonight , fine . But if I get bombed , I still know I ' ll be out there the next time the situation comes up . Sutter added , " Sure , I ' ve had success . But it ' s not just me . We ' ve got 25 guys . I don ' t even get a chance to work unless they get me to the late innings . " Porter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success in the playoffs was mainly due to his ability to relax . He had played for Kansas City in three previous playoffs , and said this one was a lot more fun . " It ' s a great feeling playing with these guys , " said Porter . " What made it nice was that for some many of them , getting this far is a first-time experience . I ' m enjoying watching them enjoy themselves . When I first came to Kansas City they ' d been there once already . This is a different team that might not have as much experience , but has a lot of talent . " I think the key to my success in this series is to go out and just relax . I didn ' t have a good year , but I said before the series began that I wasn ' t going to put any pressure on myself . I ' m looking forward to Milwaukee . I still know quite a few guys from when I played over there . They ' re like Atlanta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys who can hit , and also have great pitching and defense . " The Braves had only 15 hits in the three games , five fewer than the previous record set by Pittsburgh against Cincinnati in 1975 . When Willie McGee homered in the ninth , it was the only one of this series , another low . The previous total was three in the NL playoffs and two in the American League . . . Bob Forsch will be the starting pitcher for St. Louis in Game 1 of the World Series and John Stuper will work Game 2.
