The first dimension of playoff hockey is goaltending . Ask the Bruins , they know . Ask the Quebec Nordiques , they know too . " Our goalie won us a game , " said coach Gerry Cheevers of the Bruins . " He was fantastic , " said coach Michel Bergeron of Quebec . With those words the rival coaches summed up a hockey game that was played in a different dimension by each team . The Bruins ' dimension in the 2-1 victory was goaltending . The Nordiques ' dimension was to attack . They put 38 shots on Pete Peeters ; only one got by him . " They came at us from every angle , " said Peeters . Still , the Bruins needed a winning goal . It came from Luc Dufour , who probably shouldn ' t have been on the ice at the time . He called it , " My first big goal of the season . " This game that put the Bruins in the divisional finals against Buffalo ( that best-of-seven series may start Wednesday in Boston ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quebec ' s relentless attack . Barry Pederson had put the Bruins in front , 1-0 , at 57 seconds . Peeters had protected that lead for 43 minutes and 48 seconds with his best goaltending of the year . Then Anton Stastny whacked the puck at him from out of the right circle . It hit Peeters ' pad and dribbled into the goal . A tie game and still the Nordiques attacked . Then Dufour ' s first playoff goal . The puck was just inside the Boston blue line on the right wing . Alain Cote was trying to get it and Pederson was trying to keep him from it . " I took Cote out of the play , " said Pederson , " and then Keith Crowder came along and took it out . " " I ran ( Jean ) Hamel and got the puck and I saw Luc breaking , " Crowder said . Hamel had moved into the play to help Cote . Crowder passed the puck to Dufour breaking down the middle with no one close to him . " I call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skate for the net . I check between the goalie ' s legs and I shoot and I score . I ' m very happy . " The Bruins had a strange alignment on the ice , with one player from each of three lines . " I don ' t know how that happened , " said Cheevers . " I couldn ' t get off , " said Crowder , " and I don ' t think Luc was supposed to be on the ice . He just came off the bench . " Dufour said , " I think it ' s my turn to be on the ice . " " I suppose , " said Pederson , " you could say we played as well as we had to to win . But we deserved to win a game like this one with the season we ' ve had and maybe this is the one . You can ' t ask for anything more than that . " The Bruins really played well enough to lose . It was Peeters who played well enough to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Bergeron . " Never has one of my teams dominated a game so completely and lost . " From the beginning this looked like the Nordiques game - except that the Bruins scored the first time they got the puck out of their end . The play wentfrom Mike Krushelnyski on the left-wing boards to Rick Middleton across the ice . He passed left to Pederson and Pederson broke around Pat Price . Pederson shot from the bottom of the right circle and put the puck under goalie Dan Bouchard ' s arm . The Bruins would not have another shot at Bouchard for the next 10 minutes . The Nordiques , pressing in the attacking zone , checking the Bruins out of their game at center ice , peppered Peeters again and again , especially in the middle of the second period . He had a stretch of nearly two minutes when he made six outstanding saves . His most critical save came merely 15 seconds before Quebec tied the score . He had made a save and was down on the ice . The rebound went out toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open net . He shot the puck and Peeters with his right arm outstretched gathered it to his body . The Nordiques finally did tie the game . Peter Stastny got the puck out of the right corner and passed it to his brother , Anton , in the middle of the right circle . He whipped a shot that glanced off Peeters ' pad and slid into the goal . To a man the Bruins knew why they won this game . Pete Peeters . " He showed why he ' s the No. 1 goalie in the game , " said Pederson . " He stood on his head for us tonight . " Even Bergeron agreed with that . " Peeters was the difference , " he said .
