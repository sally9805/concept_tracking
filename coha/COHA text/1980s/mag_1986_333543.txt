The day is quiet , at first , for 26-year-old Joseph Schmuckler , program trader for Kidder Peabody . The blinking number on his computer screen , which will signal him when it is time to unleash his electronic firepower , is advising him to wait . But suddenly the stock market begins to move downward , and the telltale digit on Schmuckler 's screen starts changing like a countdown at Cape Canaveral . The trader and his two assistants erupt in a frenzy of shouted telephone conversations as they advise colleagues in New York City and Chicago to get ready for a blast of trading orders . " Strap on your seat belts , folks , " says Schmuckler . " It looks like it 's going to be another wild and woolly one ! Get ready for Program C ! Program C ! " <P> With that , an assistant leaps into the chair at a computer terminal designated for just one important job : to execute Kidder 's preset trading program called Firedown . Triggered by a few keystrokes , Firedown zips a massive order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 685,000 shares of stock in 500 different companies for a total of $31.2 million . At the same time , Schmuckler telephones an order to Chicago traders who will buy futures contracts on the stocks he is selling . The simultaneous deals , equivalent to a precomputer blizzard of paper shuffling , take just a few minutes to complete . Schmuckler is pleased . The quick transactions will bring a return several percentage points higher than the interest on a more traditional investment like Treasury bills . " God , this is exciting ! " he exclaims . " It 's so much fun . " <P> Perhaps too exhilarating , in fact . Program traders like Schmuckler have been accused of sharply accelerating the ups and downs of the stock market and making the rest of Wall Street seasick from the volatility . Computer-driven program trading began quietly enough in the early 1980s , when investment houses started employing advanced software to carry out , in a few minutes ' time , complex transactions that previously took hours or days to complete . This gave investors the ability to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just one stock . <P> That capability gave rise about three years ago to a particularly canny and complex form of program trading . It is a kind of arbitrage in which traders make lightning transactions to take advantage of fleeting discrepancies in the prices of related financial instruments in different markets . One of the most popular such plays involves the Standard &; Poor 's 500 index , which rises and falls according to the performance of 500 stocks . A program trader will use a computer 's calculating ability to monitor constantly the difference between the level of the S &P; index and the price of an S &P; 500 index future , a financial instrument that has been traded since 1982 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange . The stock-index future is basically a contract in which the investor wagers whether the market will go up or down between the moment of purchase and the time when contracts expire , which occurs about every 90 days .
