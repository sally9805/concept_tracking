Once again the Reagan administration has decided not to use force against the mad colonel of Tripoli , yet those in the U.S. who favor stronger action have been muted in their protests . Some of them think Muammar Qadhafi has become so outrageous that when he next sneezes , even our persistently ambivalent government will be forced to act . Others among the hard-liners are quiet because they are just plain depressed . The administration responded to the killings at the Rome and Vienna airports with a 10-day crescendo of pronouncements . First , officials made it clear the U.S. was not against Israeli retaliation . Next , the administration accused Col. Qadhafi of a big role in the airport attacks , and began supplying details . Then it started asking U.S. allies to help hit back somehow . By the time of this week ' s presidential news conference , Libya was clearly Topic Number One . Then , at the climax of the drum roll , the president made his announcement : The U.S. was ordering out of Libya those Americans still there . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tripoli , excluding foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms . And Mr. Reagan made clear just what he thought of Col. Qadhafi : " He ' s not only a barbarian , but he ' s flaky . " Hard-liners were not thrilled . " This is confirmation , " one insider said , " of the lack of seriousness in the foreign policy that we produce . When you are out to retaliate against a government like Libya ' s , you can ' t do it through economic sanctions against the nation as a whole . You have to move against the regime itself . " Another analyst carried the argument further . " There are certainly people in the U.S. government contemplating covert action against Col. Qadhafi , " he said . " The trouble is that it isn ' t covert anymore . Why ? Because , among other things , this fall the Washington Post published a front-page story announcing that Congress had approved a covert-action program against him . " The reasons why the government has found it so hard to act may be even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main reasons , according to reports , for not striking at Libya this time . For one thing , U.S. policy is to strike back only when we have a target definitely connected with the terrorist attack we are answering . In this case our intelligence could not meet the standard . Further , some feared , our planes might be knocked out by Libyan SAM-5s . U.S. citizens still in Libya might become hostages . The strike could stir a frenzy of anti-Americanism in Arab countries . These are all very real , concrete short-term costs that an unfriendly world might impose on us . Still , when governments are making hard choices like this one , the people who insist that the short-term worries stay at the front of everyone ' s mind are the foreign-policy equivalent of the accountants in the green eye shades . People who deal in U.S. public policy today , whatever their ideologies , are especially receptive to the accountants ' cautions . Partly this is because we are the children of PPBS , the **30;350;TOOLONG system that bright young managers brought to government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rigorous system for assessing policies we could get better control of public decisions . These hotshots brought us into the world of costs and benefits , efficiency and effectiveness , options and escalation . Their method has served many sorts of policies , but its language is mostly unsuited for thinking broadly about political action or mobilizing support for a risky venture . Once , when Vice Adm . Lord Nelson was being warned that a battle plan of his was dangerous for his battleships , he is said to have answered , " Battleships are made to be sunk . " Was Nelson a maniac ? Hardly ; he was simply telling his critics that the contemplation of risk had paralyzed them . But there is not much room for this style of persuasive speech in today ' s government conference rooms . Closer to home , the offices of the secretary of state in Washington have just been renovated with a sort of grace that would have been congenial to our first secretary of state , Thomas Jefferson . The entry hall is now being redone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will feature French doors that look welcoming despite their thick , heavy bulletproof glass . The glass will , thank goodness , make our officials less tempting targets for terrorists . Still , it calls to mind the memory of President Jefferson sending a U.S. naval expedition against the terrorists of his day , the Barbary pirates . Had Jefferson ' s cost-benefit calculator gone on the fritz ? No , he was simply measuring these costs and benefits in the longer run . Yet if he argued the same position today around the decision-making table , in a minute someone would mutter to his neighbor , " Dangerous , that man . Loose cannon if I ever saw one . " Our allies won ' t support our economic sanctions against Libya . Why should they run big risks for the small measures we ' ve taken ? Our Qadhafi problem seems to call for a combination of moves against the regime and military steps as a general announcement of our intent , but we have to unload a train load of conceptual baggage from recent years before we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next incident will push the U.S. over the edge . More likely , the terrorists and their friends will arrange to keep the next attack just below the threshold at which the U.S. would be truly compelled to act . The odds are that we will go through our agonizing debate yet again.
