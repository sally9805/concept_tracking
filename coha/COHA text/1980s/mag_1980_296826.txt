Harper 's , the nation 's oldest monthly , to close at age 130 <P> Probably no magazine in the world was ever so popular or so profitable . <P> <P> That was the way an envious competitor described Harper 's at the start of the Civil War . Since then , however , it has rarely been popular or profitable . Founded by four brothers in New York City , Harper 's has spent most of its 130 years awash in red ink , losing $1.3 million annually since 1977 . Last week America 's oldest monthly received its long-feared death notice . Said Otto Silha , chairman of the parent Minneapolis Star and Tribune Co. : " It was no longer desirable for the company to support its operation in the light of increased costs of such items as paper and postage . " <P> Harper 's ( circ. 325,000 ) had been on the block for nearly a year . Religious and other special-interest groups made inquiries but were turned away as unsuitable owners ; other prospective buyers were unwilling to absorb the maga zine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prepaid subscriptions . Editor Lewis H. Lapham and two partners failed in a last-hour rescue attempt . <P> During its illustrious history , Harper 's published the writing of Dickens , Trollope and Twain . In the late 1960s , Editor Willie Morris , a Mississippian who earned his spurs at the Texas Observer , signed up a bunch of literary gunslingers - Norman Mailer , David Halberstam , Larry King - to give the magazine what one critic called " sophistication with a whoop . " Morris and his gang walked out in 1971 when Harper 's absentee owners objected to that new direction . <P> Robert Shnayerson , a former TIME senior editor , succeeded Morris , adding earnest stories on the environment and a section called " Tools for Living , " a kind of survival guide for the bean-sprout generation . Dizzied by the Morris zig and the Shnayerson zag , droves of readers and advertisers drifted away . In 1976 , a year after Lapham took over , only 23% of subscribers renewed . ( The rate is back up to 50% , but advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monthly and Saturday Review , both of which have changed hands in the past few months , Harper 's has been hurt by the rise of less serious , more narrowly focused periodicals . Says Lapham : <P> " Twenty years ago we could have run articles on anything from toy railroads to wild boars to American politics . Now every one of these subjects has a magazine of its own . " <P> Lapham , 45 , a cerebral ex-newspaperman from San Francisco , tried to retrain Harper 's eye on important public issues , setting the tone with a crotchety column of his own . The magazine was proudly provocative , billing itself " the battlefield of the mind . " Some readers found it overly contentious and occasionally stale . The cover story for the August-and final-issue , for example , is on television evangelism , a worthy topic but one long since worked over by other magazines . Still , Harper 's is a voice that will be missed . As Lapham says , " Its closing chips a little away from one 's freedom to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
