burst of laughter erupted from Leto . " What a rogue ! " he said . " What a charming rogue ! " " Lord ? " " This is his revenge on your masters . He did not like being removedfrom my court . He told me at the time that his replacement was less than a fool . " Hwi shrugged . " A complex man , my uncle . " " Listen to me carefully , Hwi . Some of your associations here on Arrakis could be dangerous to you . I will protect you as I can . Do you understand ? " " I think so , Lord . " She stared up at him solemnly . " Now , a message for your masters . It is clear to me that they have been listening to a Guild steersman and they have joined themselves to the Tleilaxu in a perilous fashion . Tell them for me that their purposesare quite transparent . " " Lord , I have no knowledge of . . . " " I am aware of how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell your masters also that you are to be the permanent Ambassador to my court . I will not welcome another Ixian . And should your masters ignore my warnings , trying further interference with my wishes , I shall crush them . " Tears welled from her eyes and ran down her cheeks , but Leto was grateful that she did not indulge in any other display such as falling to her knees . " I already have warned them , " she said . " Truly I did . I told them they must obey you . " Leto could see that this was true . What a marvelous creature , this Hwi Noree , he thought . She ap peared the epitome of goodness , obviously bred and conditioned for this quality by her Ixian masters with their careful calculation of the effect this would have on the God Emperor . Out of his thronging ancestral memories , Leto could see her as an idealized nun , kindly and self-sacrificing , all sincerity . It was her most basic nature , the place where she lived . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shading this only to prevent pain for others . He saw this latter trait as the deepest change the Bene Gesserithad been able to effect in her . Hwi 's real manner remained outgoing , sensitive and naturally sweet . Leto could find little sense of manipulative calculation in her . She appeared immediately responsiveand wholesome , excellent at listening ( another Bene Gesserit attribute ) . There was nothing openly seductive about her , yet this very fact made her profoundly seductive to Leto.  |p151As  he had remarked to one of the earlier Duncans on a similar occasion : " You must understand this about me , a thing which some obviously suspect  --  sometimes it 's unavoidable that I have delusionarysensations , the feeling that somewhere inside this changeling form of mine there exists an adult human body with all of the necessaryfunctions . " " All of them , Lord ? " the Duncan had asked . " All ! I feel the vanished parts of myself . I can feel my legs , quite unremarkable and so real to my senses . I can feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer exist . I can even feel genitaliawhich I know , intellectually , vanished centuries ago . " " But surely if you know . . . " " Knowledge does not suppress such feelings . The vanished parts of myself are still there in my personal memories and in the multiple identity of all my ancestors . " As Leto looked at Hwi standing in front of him , it helped not one whit to know he had no skull and that what once had been his brain was now a massive web of ganglia spread through his pre-worm flesh . Nothing helped . He could still feel his brain aching where it once had reposed ; he could still feel his skull throbbing . By just standing there in front of him , Hwi cried out to his lost humanity . It was too much for him and he moaned in despair : " Why do your masters torture me ? " " Lord ? " " By sending you ! " " I would not hurt you , Lord . " " Just by existing you hurt me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell unrestrained from her eyes . " They never told me what they were really doing . " He calmed himself and spoke softly : " Leave me now , Hwi . Go about your business , but return quickly if I summon you ! " She left quietly , but Leto could see that Hwi , too , was tortured . There was no mistaking the deep sadness in her for the humanity Leto had sacrificed . She knew what Leto knew : they would have been friends , lovers , companions in an ultimate sharing between the sexes . Her masters had planned for her to know . The Ixians are cruel ! he thought . They knew what our pain would be . Hwi 's departure ignited memories of her Uncle Malky . Malky was cruel , but Leto had rather enjoyed his company . Malky had possessedall of the industrious virtues of his people and enough of their vices to make him thoroughly human . Malky had reveled in the corn/pany of Leto 's Fish Speakers . " Your houris , " he had called them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without recalling Malky 's label . Why do I think of Malky now ? It 's not just because of Hwi . I shall ask her what charge her masters gave her when they sent her to me . Leto hesitated on the verge of calling her back . She 'll tell me if I ask . Ixian ambassadors had always been told to find out why the God Emperor tolerated Ix . They knew they could not hide from him . This stupid attempt to plant a colony beyond his vision ! Were they testing his limits ? The Ixians suspected that Leto did not really need their industries . I 've never concealed my opinion of them . I said it to Malky : " Technological innovators ? No ! You are the criminals of science in my Empire ! " Malky had laughed . Irritated , Leto had accused : " Why try to hide secret laboratories and factories beyond the Empire 's rim ? You can not escape me . " " Yes , Lord . " Laughing . " I know your intent : leak a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imperial domains . Disrupt ! Cause doubts and questioning ! " " Lord , you yourself are one of our best customers ! " " That 's not what I mean and you know it , you terrible man ! " " You like me because I 'm a terrible man . I tell you stories about what we do out there . " " I know it without your stories ! " " But some stories are believed and some are doubted . I dispel your doubts . " " I have no doubts ! " Which had only ignited more of Malky 's laughter . And I must continue tolerating them , Leto thought . The Ixians operatedin the terra incognita of creative invention which had been outlawed by the Butlerian Jihad . They made their devices in the image of the mind  --  the very thing which had ignited the Jihad 's destructionand slaughter . That was what they did on Ix and Leto could only let them continue . I buy from them ! I could not even write my journals without their dictatels to respond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have hidden my journals and the printers . But they must be reminded of the dangers in what they do ! And the Guild could not be allowed to forget . That was easier.  |p153Even  while Guildsmen cooperated with Ix , they distrusted the Ixians mightily . If this new Ixian machine works , the Guild has lost its monopoly on space travel !  |p154From  that welter of memories which I can tap at will , patterns emerge . They are like another language which I see so clearly . The social-alarm signals which put societies into the postures of defense/attack are like shouted words to me . As a people , you react against threats to innocence and the peril of the helpless young . Unexplained sounds , visions and smells raise the hackles you have forgotten you possess . When alarmed , you cling to your native language because all the other patterned sounds are strange . You demand acceptable dress because a strange costume is threatening . This is system-feedback at its most primitive level . Your cells remember.  --  The Stolen JournalsThe acolyte Fish Speakers who served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought in Duro Nunepi , the Tleilaxu Ambassador . It was early for an audience and Nunepi was being taken out of his announced order , but he moved calmly with only the faintest hint of resigned acceptance . Leto waited silently stretched out along his cart on the raised platformat the end of the chamber . As he watched Nunepi approach , Leto 's memories produced a comparison : the swimming-cobra of ap155periscope brushing its almost invisible wake upon water . The memorybrought a smile to Leto 's lips . That was Nunepi  --  a proud , flintyfacedman who had come up through the ranks of Tleilaxu management . Not a Face Dancer himself , he considered the Dancers his personal servants ; they were the water through which he moved . One had to be truly adept to see his Road . Despite the early hour , the man wore his full ambassadorial regalia  --  billowingblack trousers and black sandals trimmed in gold , a flowery red jacket open at the breast to reveal a bushy chest behind his Tleilaxu crest worked in gold and jewels . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze along the rank of armed Fish Speaker guards in an arc around and behind Leto . Nunepi 's gray eyes were bright with some secret amusement when he brought his attention to his Emperor and bowed slightly . Duncan Idaho entered then , a lasgun holstered at his hip , and took up his position beside the God Emperor 's cowled face . Idaho 's appearance required a careful study by Nunepi , a study which did not please the Ambassador . " I find Shape Changers particularly obnoxious , " Leto said . " I am not a Shape Changer , Lord , " Nunepi said . I-lis voice was low and cultured , with only a trace of hesitancy in it . " But you represent them and that makes you an item of annoyance , " Leto said . Nunepi had expected an open statement of hostility , but this was not the language of diplomacy , and it shocked him into a bald reference to what he believed to be Tleilaxu strength . " Lord , by preserving the flesh of the original Duncan Idaho and providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have always assumed . . " " Duncan ! " Leto glanced at Idaho . " If I command it , Duncan , will you lead an expedition to exterminate the Tleilaxu ? " " With pleasure , m'Lord . " " Even if it means the loss of your original cells and all of the axlotl tanks ? " " I do not find the tanks a pleasant memory , m'Lord , and those cells are not me . " " Lord , how have we offended you ? " Nunepi asked . Leto scowled . Did this inept fool really expect the God Emperor to speak openly of the recent Face Dancer attack ? " It has come to my attention , " Leto said , " that you and your peo/ple have been spreading lies about what you call my disgusting sexualhabits . ' " Nunepi gaped . The accusation was a bold lie , completely unexpected . But Nunepi realized that if he denied it , no one would believe him . The God Emperor had said it . This was an attack of unknown dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lord , if we . . . " " Look at me ! " Leto commanded . Nunepi jerked his gaze up to Leto 's face . " I will inform you only this once , " Leto said . " I have no sexual habits whatsoever . None . " Perspiration rolled off Nunepi 's face . He stared at Leto with the fixed intensity of a trapped animal . When Nunepi found his voice , it no longer was the low , controlled instrument of a diplomat , but a trembling and fearful thing . " Lord , I .. . there must be a mistake of . .. " " Be still , you Tleilaxu sneak ! " Leto roared . Then : " I am a metamorphicvector of the holy sandworm  --  Shai-Hulud ! I am your God ! " " Forgive us , Lord , " Nunepi whispered . " Forgive you ? " Leto 's voice was full of sweet reason . " Of course I forgive you . That is your God 's function . Your crime is forgiven . However , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could but . . . " " Be still ! The spice allotment passes over the Tleilaxu for this decade . You get nothing . As for you personally , my Fish Speakers will now take you into the plaza . " Two burly guardswomen moved in and held Nunepi 's arms . They looked up to Leto for instructions . " In the plaza , " Leto said , " his clothing is to be stripped from him . He is to be publicly flogged  --  fifty lashes . " Nunepi struggled against the grip of his guards , consternation on his face mingled with rage . " Lord , I remind you that I am the Ambassador of .. . " " You are a common criminal and will be treated as such . " Leto nodded to the guards , who began dragging Nunepi away . " I wish they 'd killed you ! " Nunepi raged . " I wish . " " Who ? " Leto called . " You wish who had killed me ? Do n't you know I can not be killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he still raged : " I am innocent ! I am innocent ! " The protest faded away . Idaho leaned close to Leto . " Yes , Duncan ? " Leto asked . " M'Lord , all the envoys will feel fear at this . "  | " Yes . I teach a lesson in responsibility . " " M'Lord ? " " Membership in a conspiracy , as in an army , frees people from the sense of personal responsibility . " " But this will cause trouble , m'Lord . I 'd best post extra guards . " " Not one additional guard ! " " But you invite . . . " " I invite a bit of military nonsense . " " That 's what I . . . " " Duncan , I am a teacher . Remember that . By repetition , I impress the lesson . " " What lesson ? " " The ultimately suicidal nature of military foolishness . " " M'Lord , I do n't . . . " " Duncan , consider the inept Nunepi . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denseness , m'Lord , but I do not understand this thing about military . . . " " They believe that by risking death they pay the price of any violentbehavior against enemies of their own choosing . They have the invader mentality . Nunepi does not believe himself responsible for anything done against aliens . " Idaho looked at the portal where the guards had taken Nunepi . " He tried and he lost , m'Lord . " " But he cut himself loose from the restraints of the past and he objects to paying the price . " " To his people , he 's a patriot . " " And how does he see himself , Duncan ? As an instrument of his-tory . " Idaho lowered his voice and leaned closer to Leto . " How are you different , m'Lord ? " Leto chuckled . " Ahhh , Duncan , how I love your perceptiveness . You have observed that I am the ultimate alien . Do you not wonder if I also can be a loser ? " " The thought has crossed my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud mantle of the past , ' old friend . " " Are you and Nunepi alike in that ? " " Militant missionary religions can share this illusion of the proud past , ' but few understand the ultimate peril to humankind  --  that false sense of freedom from responsibility for your own actions . " " These are strange words , m'Lord . How do I take their meaning ? "  | " Their meaning is whatever speaks to you . Are you incapable of listening ? " " I have ears , m'Lord ! " " Do you now ? I can not see them . " " Here , m'Lord . Here and here ! " Idaho pointed at his own ears as he spoke . " But they do not hear . Therefore you have no ears , neither here nor hear . " " You make a joke of me , m'Lord ? " " To hear is to hear . That which exists can not be made into itself for it already exists . To be is to be . " " Your strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spoke them . They are gone . No one heard them , therefore they no longer exist . If they no longer exist , perhaps they can be made to exist again and then perhaps someone will hear them . " " Why do you poke fun at me , m'Lord ? " " I poke nothing at you except words . I do it without fear of offending because I have learned that you have no ears . " " I do n't understand you , m'Lord . " " That is the beginning of knowledge  --  the discovery of something we do not understand . " Before Idaho could respond , Leto gave a hand signal to a nearby guard who waved a hand in front of a crystalline control panel on the wall behind the God Emperor 's dais . A three-dimensional view of Nunepi 's punishment appeared in the center of the chamber . Idaho stepped down to the floor of the chamber and peered closely at the scene . It was shown from a slight elevation looking down on the plaza , and was complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene at the first signs of excitement . Nunepi was bound to two legs of a tripod , his feet spread wide , his arms tied together above him almost at the apex of the tripod . His clothing had been ripped from his body and lay around him in rags . A bulky , masked Fish Speaker stood nearby holding an improvised whip fashioned of elacca rope which had been frayed at the end into wirelike fine strands . Idaho thought he recognized the masked woman as the Friend of his first interview . At a signal from a Guard officer , the masked Fish Speaker stepped forward and brought the elacca whip down in a slashing arc onto Nunepi 's exposed back . Idaho winced . The crowd gasped . Welts appeared where the whip had struck , but Nunepi remained silent.  |p159Again  , the whip descended . Blood betrayed the lines of this second stroke . Once more , the whip flayed Nunepi 's back . More blood appeared . Leto felt remote sadness . Nayla is too ardent , he thought . She will kill him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leto called . Idaho turned from his fascinated examination of the projected scene just as a shout lifted from the crowd  --  response to a particularly bloody stroke . " Send someone to stop the flogging after twenty lashes , " Leto said . " Have it announced that the magnanimity of the God Emperor has reduced the punishment . " Idaho raised a hand to one of the guards , who nodded and ran from the chamber . " Come here , Duncan , " Leto said . Still smarting under what he believed was Leto 's poking fun at him , Idaho returned to Leto 's side . " Whatever I do , " Leto said , " it is to teach a lesson . " Idaho rigidly willed himself not to look back at the scene of Nunepi 's punishment . Was that the sound of Nunepi groaning ? The shouts of the crowd pierced Idaho . He stared up into Leto 's eyes . " There is a question in your mind , " Leto said . " Many questions , m'Lord . " " Speak them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's punishment ? What do we say when asked ? " " We say that no one is permitted to blaspheme against the God Emperor . " " A bloody lesson , m'Lord . " " Not as bloody as some I 've taught . " Idaho shook his head from side to side in obvious dismay . " Nothinggood 's going to come of this ! " " Precisely ! "  |p160Safaris  through ancestral memories teach me many things . The patterns , ahhh , the patterns . Liberal bigots arethe ones who trouble me most . I distrust the extremes . Scratch a conservative and you find someone who prefersthe past over any future . Scratch a liberal and find a closetaristocrat . It 's true ! Liberal governments always developinto aristocracies . The bureaucracies betray the true intentof people who form such governments . Right from thefirst , the little people who formed the governments whichpromised to equalize the social burdens found themselvessuddenly in the hands of bureaucratic aristocracies . Ofcourse , all bureaucracies follow this pattern , but what ahypocrisy to find this even under a communized banner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's that patternsare repeated . My oppressions , by and large , are no worsethan any of the others and , at least , I teach a new lesson.  --  The Stolen JournalsIt was well into the darkness of Audience Day before Leto could meet with the Bene Gesserit delegation . Moneo had prepared the Reverend Mothers for the delay , repeating the God Emperor 's reassurances.  |p161Re|porting  back to his Emperor , Moneo had said : " They expect a rich reward . " " We shall see , " Leto had said . " We shall see . Now , tell me what it was the Duncan demanded of you as you entered . " " He wished to know if you had ever before had someone flogged . " " And you replied ? " " That there was no record of , nor had I ever before witnessed , such a punishment . " " His response ? " " This is not Atreides . " " Does he think I 'm insane ? " " He did not say that . " " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duncan ? " " He has met the Ixian Ambassador , Lord . He finds Hwi Noree attractive . He inquired of . . . " " That must be prevented , Moneo ! I trust you to raise barriers against any liaison between the Duncan and Hwi . " " My Lord commands . " " Indeed I do ! Go now and prepare for our meeting with the women of the Bene Gesserit . I will receive them at False Sietch . " " Lord , is there significance in this choice of a meeting place ? " " A whim . On your way out , tell the Duncan he may take out a troop of guards and scour the City for trouble . " Waiting for the Bene Gesserit delegation at False Sietch , Leto reviewedthis exchange , finding some amusement in it . He could imagine the reactions through the Festival City at the approach of a disturbedDuncan Idaho in command of a Fish Speaker troop . Like the quick silence of frogs when a predator comes . Now that he was in False Sietch , Leto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of irregular domes at the edge of Onn , False Sietch was almost a kilometer across . It had been the first abode of the Museum Fremen and now was their school , its corridors and chambers patrolled by alert Fish Speakers . The reception hall where Leto waited , an oval about two hundred meters in its long dimension , was illuminated by giant glowglobes which floated in blue-green isolation some thirty meters above the floor . The light muted the dull browns and tans of the imitation stone from which the entire structure had been fashioned . Leto waited on a low ledge at one end of the chamber , looking outward through a half-circle window longer than his body . The opening , four stories above the ground , framed a view which included a remnant of the ancient Shield Wall preserved for its cliffside caves where Atreidesp162troops had once been slaughtered by Harkonnen attackers . The frosty light of First Moon silvered the cliff 's outlines . Fires dotted the cliffside , the flames exposed where no Fremen would have dared betrayhis presence . The fires winked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum Fremen exercising their right to occupy the sacred precincts . Museum Fremen ! Leto thought . They were such narrow thinkers with near horizons . But why should I object ? They are what I made them . Leto heard the Bene Gesserit delegation then . They chanted as they approached , a heavy sound all a-jostle with vowels . Moneo preceded them with a guard detail which took up position on Leto 's ledge . Moneo stood on the chamber floor just below Leto 's face , glanced at Leto , turned to the open hall . The women entered in a double file , ten of them led by two ReverendMothers in traditional black robes . " That is Anteac on the left , Luyseyal on the right , " Moneo said . The names recalled for Leto the earlier words about the Reverend Mothers brought in by Moneo , agitated and distrustful . Moneo did not like the witches . " They 're both Truthsayers , " Moneo had said . " Anteac is much older than Luyseyal , but the latter is reputed to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anteac has a scar on her forehead whose origin we have been unable to discover . Luyseyalhas red hair and appears remarkably young for one of her rep-utation . " As he watched the Reverend Mothers approach with their entourage , Leto felt the quick surge of his memories . The women wore their hoods forward , shrouding their faces . The attendants and acolyteswalked at a respectful distance behind . . . it was all of a piece . Some patterns did not change . These women might have been enteringa real sietch with real Fremen here to honor them . Their heads know what their bodies deny , he thought . Leto 's penetrating vision saw the subservient caution in their eyes , but they strode up the long chamber like people confident of their religious power . It pleased Leto to think that the Bene Gesserit possessed only such powers as he permitted . The reasons for this indulgence were clear to him . Of all the people in his Empire , Reverend Mothers were most like him  --  limited to the memories of only their female ancestors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , each of them did exist as somewhat of an integrated mob.  |p163The  Reverend Mothers came to a stop at the required ten paces from Leto 's ledge . The entourage spread out on each side . It amused Leto to greet such delegations in the voice and persona of his grandmother , Jessica . The Bene Gesserit had come to expect this and he did not disappoint them . " Welcome , Sisters , " he said . The voice was a smooth contralto , definitely Jessica 's controlled feminine tones with just a hint of mockery  --  a voice recorded and often studied in the Sisterhood 's Chapter House . As he spoke , Leto sensed menace . Reverend Mothers were never pleased when he greeted them this way , but the reaction here carried different undertones . Moneo , too , sensed it . He raised a finger and the guards moved closer to Leto . Anteac spoke first : " Lord , we watched that display in the plaza this morning . What do you gain by such antics ? " So that 's the tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own voice , he said : " You are temporarily in my good graces . Would you change that ? " " Lord , " Anteac said , " we are shocked that you could thus punish an Ambassador . We do not understand what you gain by this . " " I gain nothing . I am diminished . " Luyseyal spoke up : " This can only reinforce thoughts of oppres-sion . " " I wonder why so few ever thought of the Bene Gesserit as oppressors ? " Leto asked . Anteac spoke to her companion : " If it pleases the God Emperor to inform us , he will do so . Let us get to the purposes of our Em-bassy . " Leto smiled . " The two of you can come closer . Leave your attendantsand approach . " Moneo stepped two paces to his right as the Reverend Mothers moved in characteristic silent gliding to within three paces of the ledge . " It 's almost as though they had no feet ! " Moneo had once complained . Recalling this , Leto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were menacing , but Moneo dared not object to their nearness . The God Emperor had ordered it ; thus it would be . Leto lifted his attention to the attendants waiting where the Bene Gesserit entourage had first stopped . The acolytes wore hoodless black gowns . He saw tiny clues to forbidden rituals about them  --  an amulet , a small trinket , a colorful corner of a kerchief so arranged that more color might be flashed carefully . Leto knew that the Rever/end Mothers allowed this because they no longer could share the spice as once they had . Ritual substitutes . There were significant changes across the past ten years . A new parsimony had entered the Sisterhood 's thinking . They are coming out , Leto told himself . The old , old mysteries are still here . The ancient patterns had lain dormant in the Bene Gesserit memoriesfor all of those millennia . Now , they emerge . I must warn my Fish Speakers . He returned his attention to the Reverend Mothers . " You have requests ? " " What is it like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was an interesting attack . They had not tried it in more than a generation . Well . . . why not ? " Sometimes my dreams are blocked off and redirected into strange places , " he said . " If my cosmic memories are a web , as you two certainlyknow , then think about the dimensions of my web and where such memories and dreams might lead . " " You speak of our certain knowledge , " Anteac said . " Why ca n't we join forces at last ? We are more alike than we are different . " " I would sooner link myself to those degenerate Great Houses bewailingtheir lost spice riches ! " Anteac held herself still , but Luyseyal pointed a finger at Leto . " We offer community ! " " And I insist on conflict ? " Anteac stirred , then : " It is said that there is a principle of conflict which originated with the single cell and has never deteriorated . " " Some things remain incompatible , " Leto agreed . " Then how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leto hardened his voice . " As you well know , the secret of communitylies in suppression of the incompatible . " " There can be enormous value in cooperation , " Anteac said . " To you , not to me . " Anteac contrived a sigh . " Then , Lord , will you tell us about the physical changes in your person ? " " Someone besides yourself should know about and record such things , " Luyseyal said . " In case something dreadful should happen to me ? " Leto asked . " Lord ! " Anteac protested . " We do not . . . " " You dissect me with words when you would prefer sharper instruments , " Leto said . " Hypocrisy offends me. "  | " We protest , Lord , " Anteac said . " Indeed you do . I hear you . " Luyseyal crept a few millimeters closer to the ledge , bringing a sharp stare from Moneo , who glanced up at Leto then . Moneo 's expressiondemanded action , but Leto ignored him , curious now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centered in the redhairedone . What is she ? Leto wondered . Could she be a Face Dancer , after all ? No . None of the telltale signs were there . No . Luyseyal presented an elaborately relaxed appearance , not even a little twist of her featuresto test the God Emperor 's powers of observation . " Will you not tell us about your physical changes , Lord ? " Anteac asked . Diversion ! Leto thought . " My brain grows enormous , " he said . " Most of the human skull has dissolved away . There are no severe limits to the growth of my cortex and its attendant nervous system . " Moneo darted a startled glance at Leto . Why was the God Emperorgiving away such vital information ? These two would trade it . But both women were obviously fascinated by this revelation , hesitatingin whatever plan they had evolved . " Does your brain have a center ? " Luyseyal asked . " I am the center , " Leto said . " A location ? " Anteac asked . She gestured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ledge . " What value do you place on the things I reveal to you ? " Leto asked . The two women betrayed no change of expression , which was betrayalenough by itself . A smile flitted across Leto 's lips . " The marketplace has captured you , " he said . " Even the Bene Gesserit has been infected by the suk mentality . " " We do not deserve that accusation , " Anteac said . " But you do . The suk mentality dominates my Empire . The uses of the market have only been sharpened and amplified by the demands of our times . We have all become traders . " " Even you , Lord ? " Luyseyal asked . " You tempt my wrath , " he said . " You 're a specialist in that , are n't you ? " " Lord ? " Luyseyal 's voice was calm , but overly controlled . " Specialists are not to be trusted , " Leto said . " Specialists are masters of exclusion , experts in the narrow . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anteac said.  | " Better than what ? " Leto asked . Luyseyal eased herself a fractional pace closer to Leto . " We hope to set our standards by your judgment , Lord , " Anteac said . " But you would be architects . Would you build higher walls ? Never forget , Sisters , that I know you . You are efficient purveyors of blinders . " " Life continues , Lord , " Anteac said . " Indeed ! And so does the universe . " Luyseyal eased herself a bit closer , ignoring the fixity of Moneo 's attention . Leto smelled it then and almost laughed aloud . Spice-essence ! They had brought some spice-essence . They knew the old stories about sandworms and spice-essence , of course . Luyseyal carried it . She thought of it as a specific poison for sandworms . That was obvious . Bene Gesserit records and the Oral History agreed on this . The essence shattered the worm , precipitating its dissolution and resulting ( eventually ) in sandtrout which would produce more sandworms  --  etcetera , etcetera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in me that you should know about , " Leto said . " I am not yet sandworm , not fully . Think of me as somethingcloser to a colony creature with sensory alterations . " Luyseyal 's left hand moved almost imperceptibly toward a fold in her gown . Moneo saw it and looked to Leto for instructions , but Leto only returned the hooded glare of Luyseyal 's eyes . " There have been fads in smells , " Leto said . Luyseyal 's hand hesitated . " Perfumes and essences , " he said . " I remember them all , even the cults of the non-smells are mine . People have used underarm sprays and crotch sprays to mask their natural odors . Did you know that ? Of course you knew it ! " Anteac 's gaze moved toward Luyseyal . Neither woman dared speak . " People knew instinctively that their pheromones betrayed them , " Leto said . The women stood immobile . They heard him . Of all his people , Reverend Mothers were best equipped to understand his hidden message . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory , " Leto said , his voice accusing . " We are jealous , Lord , " Luyseyal confessed.  | " You have misread the history of spice-essence , " Leto said . " Sandtrout sense it only as water . " " It was a test , Lord , " Anteac said . " That is all " " You would test me ? " " Blame our curiosity , Lord , " Anteac said . " I , too , am curious . Put your spice-essence on the ledge beside Moneo . I will keep it . " Slowly , demonstrating by the steadiness of her movements that she intended no attack , Luyseyal reached beneath her gown and removed a small vial which glistened with an inner blue radiance . She placed the vial gently on the ledge . Not by any sign did she indicate that she might try something desperate . " Truthsayer , indeed , " Leto said . She favored him with a faint grimace which might have been a smile , then withdrew to Anteac 's side . " Where did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought it from smugglers , " Anteac said . " There 've been no smugglers for almost twenty-five hundred years . " " Waste not , want not , " Anteac said . " I see . And now you must reevaluate what you think of as your own patience , is that not so ? " " We have been watching the evolution of your body , Lord , " Anteacsaid . " We thought . . . " She permitted herself a small shrug , thelevel of gesture warranted for use with a Sister and not given lightly . Leto pursed his lips in response . " I can not shrug , " he said . " Will you punish us ? " Luyseyal asked . " For amusing me ? " Luyseyal glanced at the vial on the ledge . " I swore to reward you , " Leto said . " I shall . " " We would prefer to protect you in our community , Lord , " Anteacsaid . " Do not seek too great a reward , " he said . Anteac nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have reason to believe they may venture against you . " " I fear them no more than I fear you . " " Surely you 've heard what the Ixians are doing , " Luyseyal said . " Moneo brings me an occasional copy of a message between personsor groups in my Empire . I hear many stories . " " We speak of a new Abomination , Lord ! " Anteac said . " You think the Ixians can produce an artificial intelligence ? " he asked . " Conscious the way you are conscious ? " " We fear it , Lord , " Anteac said.  | " You would have me believe that the Butlerian Jihad survives among the Sisterhood ? " " We do not trust the unknown which can arise from imaginative technology , " Anteac said . Luyseyal leaned toward him . " The Ixians boast that their machine will transcend Time in the way that you do it , Lord . " " And the Guild says there 's Time-chaos around the Ixians , " Leto mocked . " Are we to fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffly . " I speak truth with you two , " Leto said . " I recognize your abilities . Will you not recognize mine ? " Luyseyal gave him a curt nod . " Tleilaxu and Ix make alliance with the Guild and seek our full cooperation . " " And you fear Ix the most ? " " We fear anything we do not control , " Anteac said . " And you do not control me . " " Without you , people would need us ! " Anteac said . " Truth at last ! " Leto said . " You come to me as your Oracle and you ask me to put your fears to rest . " Anteac 's voice was frigidly controlled . " Will Ix make a mechanicalbrain ? " " A brain ? Of course not ! " Luyseyal appeared to relax , but Anteac remained unmoving . She was not satisfied with the Oracle . Why is it that foolishness repeats itself with such monotonous precision ? Leto wondered . His memories offered up countless scenes to match this one  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , portentous voices delivering dangerous prophecies through the smoke of holy narcotics . He glanced down at the iridescent vial on the ledge beside Moneo . What was the current value of that thing ? Enormous . It was the essence . Concentrated wealth concentrated . " You have already paid the Oracle , " he said . " It amuses me to give you full value . " How alert the women became ! " Hear me ! " he said . " What you fear is not what you fear . " Leto liked the sound of that . Sufficiently portentous for any Oracle . Anteac and Luyseyal stared up at him , dutiful supplicants . Behindthem , an acolyte cleared her throat . That one will be identified and reprimanded later , Leto thought . Anteac had now had sufficient time to ruminate on Leto 's words . She said : " An obscure truth is not the truth . " " But I have directed your attention correctly , " Leto said.  | " Are you telling us not to fear the machine ? " Luyseyal asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Why come begging to me ? " " But we do not have your powers , " Anteac said . " You complain then that you do not sense the gossamer waves of Time . You do not sense my continuum . And you fear a mere ma-chine ! " " Then you will not answer us , " Anteac said . " Do not make the mistake of thinking me ignorant about your Sisterhood'sways , " he said . " You are alive . Your senses are exquisitely tuned . I do not stop this , nor should you . " " But the Ixians play with automation ! " Anteac protested . " Discrete pieces , finite bits linked one to another , " he agreed . " Once set in motion , what is to stop it ? " Luyseyal discarded all pretense of Bene Gesserit self-control , a fine comment on her recognition of Leto 's powers . Her voice almost screeched : " Do you know what the Ixians boast ? That their machine will predict your actions ! " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , the more they must be my allies . They can not conquer me , but I can conquer them . " Anteac made to speak but stopped when Luyseyal touched her arm . " Are you already allied with Ix ? " Luyseyal asked . " We hear that you conferred overlong with their new Ambassador , this Hwi Noree . " " I have no allies , " he said . " Only servants , students and enemies . " " And you do not fear the Ixians ' machine ? " Anteac insisted . " Is automation synonymous with conscious intelligence ? " heasked . Anteac 's eyes went wide and filmy as she withdrew into her memories . Leto found himself caught by fascination with what she must be encountering there within her own internal mob . We share some of those memories , he thought . Leto felt then the seductive attraction of community with ReverendMothers . It would be so familiar , so supportive . . . and so deadly . Anteac was trying to lure him once more . She spoke : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the difference between serial bits and an unbroken continuum . We have the one ; machines are confined to the other . " " You still have the power of reason , " he said . " Share ! " Luyseyal said . It was a command to Anteac and it re/vealed with sharp abruptness who really dominated this pair  --  the younger over the older . Exquisite , Leto thought . " Intelligence adapts , " Anteac said . Parsimonious with her words , too , Leto thought , hiding his amusement . " Intelligence creates , " Leto said . " That means you must deal with responses never before imagined . You must confront the new . " " Such as the possibility of the Ixian Machine , " Anteac said . It was not a question . " Is n't it interesting , " Leto asked , " that being a superb Reverend Mother is not enough ? " His acute senses detected the sudden fearful tightening in both of the women . Truthsayers , indeed ! " You are right to fear me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded : " How do you know you 're even alive ? " As Moneo had done so many times , they heard in his voice the deadly consequences of failure to answer him correctly . It fascinated Leto that both women glanced at Moneo before either responded . " I am the mirror of myself , " Luyseyal said , a pat Bene Gesserit answer which Leto found offensive . " I do n't need pre-set tools to deal with my human problems , " Anteacsaid . " Your question is sophomoric ! " " Hah , bah ! " Leto laughed . " How would you like to quit the Bene Gesserit and join me ? " He could see her consider and then reject the invitation , but she did not hide her amusement . Leto looked at the puzzled Luyseyal . " If it falls outside your yardsticks , then you are engaged with intelligence , not with automation , " he said . And he thought : That Luyseyal will never again dominate old Anteac . Luyseyal was angry now and not bothering to conceal it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have provided you with machines that simulate human thinking . If you have such a low opinion of them , why . . . " " She should not be let out of the Chapter House without a guardian , " Leto said , addressing Anteac . " Is she afraid to address her own memories ? " Luyseyal paled , but remained silent . Leto studied her coldly . " Our ancestors ' long unconscious relationship with machines has taught us something , do n't you think ? " Luyseyal merely glared at him , not ready yet to risk death through open defiance of the God Emperor.  | " Would you say we at least know the attraction of machines ? " Leto asked . Luyseyal nodded . " A well-maintained machine can be more reliable than a human servant , " Leto said . " We can trust machines not to indulge in emotionaldistractions . " Luyseyal found her voice . " Does this mean you intend to remove the Butlerian prohibition against abominable machines ? " " I swear to you , " Leto said , speaking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display further such stupidity , I will have you publicly executed . I am not your Oracle ! " Luyseyal opened her mouth and closed it without speaking . Anteac touched her companion 's arm , sending a quick tremor through Luyseyal 's body . Anteac spoke softly in an exquisite demonstration of Voice : " Our God Emperor will never openly defy the proscriptions of the Butlerian Jihad . " Leto smiled at her , a gentle commendation . It was such a pleasure to see a professional performing at her best . " That should be obvious to any conscious intelligence , " he said . " There are limits of my own choosing , places where I will not inter-fere . " He could see both women absorbing the multi-pronged thrust of his words , weighing the possible meanings and intents . Was the God Emperor distracting them , focusing their attention on the Ixians while he maneuvered elsewhere ? Was he telling the Bene Gesserit that the time had come to choose sides against the Ixians ? Was it possible his words had no more than their surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored . He was undoubtedlythe most devious creature the universe had ever spawned . Leto scowled at Luyseyal , knowing he could only add to their confusion . " I point out to you , Marcus Claire Luyseyal , a lesson from past over-machined societies which you appear not to have learned . The devices themselves condition the users to employ each other the way they employ machines . " He turned his attention to Moneo . " Moneo ? " " I see him , Lord . " Moneo craned his neck to peer over the Bene Gesserit entourage . Duncan Idaho had entered the far portal , and strode across the open floor of the chamber toward Leto . Moneo did not relax his wariness , his distrust of the Bene Gesserit , but he recognized the nature of Leto 's lecture . He is testing , always testing . Anteac cleared her throat . " Lord , what of our reward ? " " You are brave , " Leto said . " No doubt that 's why you were cho/sen for this Embassy . Very well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its present level . As for the rest , I will ignore what you really intended with the spice-essence . Am I not gen-erous ? " " Most generous , Lord , " Anteac said , and there was not the slightest hint of bitterness in her voice . Duncan Idaho brushed past the women then and stopped beside Moneo to peer up at Leto . " M'Lord , there 's . . . " He broke off and glanced at the two Reverend Mothers . " Speak openly , " Leto commanded . " Yes , m'Lord . " There was reluctance in him , but he obeyed . " We were attacked at the southeast edge of the City , a distraction I believebecause there now are reports of more violence in the City and in the Forbidden Forest  --  many scattered raiding parties . " " They are hunting my wolves , " Leto said . " In the forest and in the City , they are hunting my wolves . " Idaho 's brows contracted into a puzzled frown . " Wolves in the City , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wolves  --  to me there is no essential difference . " Moneo gasped . Leto smiled at him , thinking how beautiful it was to observe a moment of realization  --  a veil pulled away from the eyes , the mind opened . " I have brought a large force of guards to protect this place , " Idaho said . " They are posted through the . . . " " I knew you would , " Leto said . " Now pay close attention while I tell you where to send the rest of your forces . " As the Reverend Mothers watched in awe , Leto laid out for Idaho the exact points for ambushes , detailing the size of each force and even some of the specific personnel , the timing , the necessary weapons , the precise deployments at each place . Idaho 's capacious memorycatalogued each instruction . He was too caught up in the recital to question it until Leto fell silent , but a look of puzzled fear came over Idaho then . For Leto , it was as though he peered directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was a trusted soldier of the original Lord Leto , Idaho was thinking . That Leto , the grandfatherof this one , saved me and took me into his household like a son . But even though that Leto still has some kind of existence in this one . . . this is not him . " M'Lord , why do you need me ? " Idaho asked . " For your strength and loyalty . "  |p173Idaho  shook his head . " But .. . " " You obey , " Leto said , and he noted the way these words were being absorbed by the Reverend Mothers . Truth , only truth , for they are Truthsayers . " Because I owe a debt to the Atreides , " Idaho said . " That is where we place our trust , " Leto said . " And Duncan ? " " M'Lord ? " Idaho 's voice said he had found ground where he could stand . " Leave at least one survivor at each place , " Leto said . " Otherwise , our efforts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , striding back across the hall the way he had come . And Leto thought it would take an extremely sensitive eye indeed to see that it was a different Idaho leaving , far different from the one who had entered . Anteac said : " This comes of flogging that Ambassador . " " Exactly , " Leto agreed . " Recount this carefully to your Superior , the admirable Reverend Mother Syaksa . Tell her for me that I prefer the company of predators above that of the prey . " He glanced at Moneo , who drew himself to attention . " Moneo , the wolves are gone from my forest . They must be replaced by human wolves . See to it . "  |p174The  trance-state of prophecy is like no other visionary experience . It is not a retreat from the raw exposure of the senses ( as are many trance-states ) but an immersion in a multitude of new movements . Things move . It is an ultimatepragmatism in the midst of Infinity , a demanding consciousness where you come at last into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it changes , that its rules change , that nothing remains permanent or absolute throughout all such movement , that mechanical explanations for anything can work only within precise confinements and , once the walls are broken down , the old explanations shatter and dissolve , blown away by new movements . The things you see in this trance are sobering , often shattering . They demand your utmost effort to remainwhole and , even so , you emerge from that state profoundlychanged.  --  The Stolen JournalsThat night of Audience Day , while others slept and fought and dreamed and died , Leto took his repose in the isolation of his audiencechamber , only a few trusted Fish Speaker guards at the portals.  |p175He  did not sleep . His mind whirled with necessities and disappointments . Hwi ! Hwi ! He knew why Hwi Noree had been sent to him now . How well he knew ! My most secret secret is exposed . They had discovered his secret . Hwi was the evidence of it . He thought desperate thoughts . Could this terrible metamorphosis be reversed ? Could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were possible , the process would take him just as long as it had taken to reach this point . Where would Hwi be in more than three thousand years ? Dry dust and bones in the crypt . I could breed something like her and prepare that one for me , but that would not be my gentle Hwi . And what of the Golden Path while he indulged in such selfish goals ? To hell with the Golden Path ! Have these folly-bound idiots ever thought once of me ? Not once ! But that was not true . Hwi thought of him . She shared his torture . These were thoughts of madness and he tried to put them awaywhile his senses reported the soft movement of the guards and theflow of water beneath his chamber . When I made this choice , what were my expectations ? How the mob within laughed at that question ! Did he not have a task to complete ? Was that not the very essence of the agreement which kept the mob in check ? " You have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have but one pur-pose . " Single purpose is the mark of the fanatic and I am not a fanatic ! " You must be cynical and cruel . You can not break the trust . " Why not ? " Who took that oath ? You did . You chose this course . " Expectations ! " The expectations which history creates for one generation are often shattered in the next generation . Who knows that better than you ? " Yes . . . and shattered expectations can alienate whole populations . I alone am a whole population ! " Remember your oath ! " Indeed . I am the disruptive force unleashed across the centuries . I limit expectations . . . including my own . I dampen the pendulum . " And then release it . Never forget that . "  |p176I  am tired . Oh , how tired 1 am . If only I could sleep . . . really sleep . " You 're full of self-pity , too . " Why not ? What am I ? The ultimate loner forced to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . . . and now , Hwi ! " Your original unselfish choice fills you now with selfishness . " There is danger all around . I must wear my selfishness like a suit of armor . " There 's danger for everyone who touches you . Is n't that your very nature ? " Danger even for Hwi . Dear , delectable , dear Hwi . " Did you build high walls around you only to sit within them and indulge in self-pity ? " The walls were built because great forces have been unleashed in my Empire . " You unleashed them . Will you now compromise with them ? " It 's Hwi 's doing . These feelings have never before been this powerfulin me . It 's the damnable Ixians ! " How interesting that they should assault you with flesh rather than with a machine . " Because they have discovered my secret . " You know the antidote . " Leto 's great body trembled through its entire length at this thought . He well knew the antidote which had always worked before : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not even the Bene GesseritSisters could take such safaris , striking inward along the axis of memories  --  back , back to the very limits of cellular awareness , or stopping by a wayside to revel in a sophisticated sensory delight . Once , after the death of a particularly superb Duncan , he had toured great musical performances preserved in his memories . Mozart had tired him quickly . Pretentious ! But Bach . . . ahhh , Bach . Leto remembered the joy of it . I sat at the organ and let the music drench me . Only three times in all memory had there been an equal to Bach . But even Licallo was not better ; as good , but not better . Would female intellectuals be the proper choice for this night ? Grandmother Jessica had been one of the best . Experience told him that someone as close to him as Jessica would not be the proper antidotefor his present tensions . The search would have to venture much farther . He imagined then describing such a safari to some awe-struck visitor , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a holy matter.  | " I course backward down the flight of ancestors , hunting along the tributaries , darting into nooks and crannies . You would not recognize many of their names . Who has ever heard of Norma Cenva ? I have lived her ! " " Lived her ? " his imaginary visitor asked . " Of course . Why else would one keep one 's ancestors around ? You think a man designed the first Guild ship ? Your history books told you it was Aurelius Venport ? They lied . It was his mistress , Norma . She gave him the design , along with five children . He thought his ego would take no less . In the end , the knowledge that he had not really fulfilled his own image , that was what destroyed him . " " You have lived him , too ? " " Naturally . And I have traversed the far wanderings of the Fremen . Through my father 's line and the others , I have gone right back to the House of Atreus . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share of fools . " Distraction is what I need , he thought . Would it be a tour through sexual dalliances and exploits , then ? " You have no idea what internal orgies are available to me ! I am the ultimate voyeur  --  participant(s) and observer(s) . Ignorance and misunderstandings about sexuality have caused so much distress . How abysmally narrow we have been  --  how miserly . " Leto knew he could not make that choice , not this night , not with Hwi out there in his City . Would he choose a review of warfare , then ? " Which Napoleon was the greater coward ? " he asked his imaginaryvisitor . " I will not reveal it , but I know . Oh , yes , I know . " Where can I go ? With all of the past open to me , where can I go ? The brothels , the atrocities , the tyrants , the acrobats , nudists , surgeons , male whores , musicians , magicians , ungenciers , priests , artisans , priestesses . . . " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that the hula preserves an ancient sign language which once belonged only to males ? You 've never heard of the hula ? Of course . Who dances it anymore ? Dancers have preserved many things , though . The translationshave been lost , but I know them . " One whole night I was a series of caliphs moving eastward and westward with Islam  --  a traverse of centuries . I will not bore you with the details . Be gone now , visitor ! " How seductive it is , he thought , this call of the siren which would have me live only in the past . And how useless that past now , thanks to the damnable Ixians.  |p178How  boring the past when Hwi is here . She would come to me right now if I summoned her . But I can not call for her . . . not now . . . not tonight . The past continued to beckon . I could make a pilgrimage into my past . It does not have to be a safari . I could go alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the difference . I could go alone into my inner world . And never return . Leto felt the inevitability of it , that the dream-state would eventuallytrap him . I create a special dream-state throughout my Empire . Within this dream , new myths form , new directions appear and new movements . New . . . new . . . new . . . The things emerge from my own dreams , out of my myths . Who more susceptible to them than I ? The hunter is caught in his own net . Leto knew then that he had encountered a condition for which no antidote existed  --  past , present or future . His great body trembled and shivered in the gloom of his audience chamber . At the portal , one Fish Speaker guard whispered to another : " Is God troubled ? " And her companion replied : " The sins of this universe would trouble anyone . " Leto heard them and wept silently.  |p179When  I set out to lead humankind along my Golden Path , I promised them a lesson their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny with their words even while their actions affirm it . They say they seek security and quiet , the condition they call peace . Even as they speak , they create the seeds of turmoil and violence . If they find their quiet security , they squirm in it . How boring they find it . Look at them now . Look at what they do while I record these words . Hah ! I give them enduring eons of enforced tranquility which plods on and on despite their every effort to escape into chaos . Believe me , the memory of Leto 's Peace shall abide with them forever . They will seek their quiet security thereafter only with extreme caution and steadfast preparation.  --  The Stolen JournalsMuch against his will , Idaho found himself at dawn with Siona beside him being taken to " a safe place " in an Imperial ornithopter . It raced eastward toward the golden arc of sunlight which lifted over a landscape carved into rectangular green plantations . The ' thopter was a big one , large enough to carry a small squad of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the squad , ap180brawny woman with a face Idaho could believe had never smiled , had given her name as Inmeir . She sat in the pilot 's seat directly ahead of Idaho , two muscular Fish Speaker guards on either side of her . Five more guards sat behind Idaho and Siona . " God has ordered me to take you away from the City , " Inmeir had said , coming up to him in the command post beneath the central plaza . " It is for your own safety . We will return by tomorrow morningfor Siaynoq . " Idaho , fatigued by a night of alarms , had sensed the futility of arguingagainst the orders of " God Himself . " Inmeir appeared quite capable of trundling him off under one of her thick arms . She had led him from the command post into a chilly night canopied with stars like stone-edged facets of shattered brilliants . It was only when they reached the ' thopter and Idaho recognized Siona waiting there that he had begun to question the purpose of this outing . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the violencein Onn had originated with the organized rebels . When he had inquired after Siona , Moneo had sent word that " my daughter is safely out of the way , " adding at the end of the message : " I commendher to your care . " In the ' thopter , Siona had not responded to Idaho 's questions . Even now , she sat in sullen silence beside him . She reminded him of himself in those first bitter days when he had vowed vengeance against the Harkonnens . He wondered at her bitterness . What drove her ? Without knowing why , Idaho found himself comparing Siona with Hwi Noree . It had not been easy to encounter Hwi , but he had managedit in spite of the importunate demands of Fish Speakers that he attend to duties elsewhere . Gentle , that was the word for Hwi . She acted from a core of unchanging gentleness which was , in its own way , a thing of enormouspower . He found this intensely attractive . I must see more of her . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sullen silence of Siona seated beside him . Well . . . silence could be met with silence . Idaho peered down at the passing landscape . Here and there he could see the clustered lights of villages winking out as the sunlight approached . The desert of the Sareer lay far behind and this was land that , by its appearance , might never have been parched . Some things do not change very much , he thought . They are merely taken from one place and reformed in another place . This landscape reminded him of Caladan 's lush gardens and made him wonder what had become of the verdant planet where thep181Atreides had lived for so many generations before coming to Dune . He could identify narrow roads , market roads with a scattered traffic of vehicles drawn by six-legged animals which he guessed were thorses . Moneo had said that thorses tailored to the needs of such a landscape were the main work beasts not only here but throughout the Empire . " A population which walks is easier to control . " Moneo 's words rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared ahead of the ' thopter , softly rolling green hills cut into irregular patterns by black stone walls . Idaho recognized sheep and several kinds of large cattle . The ' thopter passed over a narrow valley still in gloom and with only a hint of the water coursingdown its depths . A single light and a blue plume of smoke lifting out of the valley 's shadows spoke of human occupation . Siona suddenly stirred and tapped their pilot on the shoulder , pointing off to the right ahead of them . " Is n't that Goygoa over there ? " Siona asked . " Yes . " Inmeir spoke without turning , her voice clipped and touched by some emotion which Idaho could not identify . " Is that not a safe place ? " Siona asked . " It is safe . " Siona looked at Idaho . " Order her to take us to Goygoa . " Without knowing why he complied , Idaho said : " Take us to that place . " Inmeir turned then and her features , which Idaho had thought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear evidence of some deep feeling . Her mouth was drawn down into a scowl . A nerve twitched at the corner of her right eye . " Not Goygoa , Commander , " Inmeir said . " There are better . . . " " Did the God Emperor tell you to take us to a specific place ? " Siona demanded . Inmeir glared her anger at this interruption , but did not look directly at Siona . " No , but He . . . " " Then take us to this Goygoa , " Idaho said . Inmeir jerked her attention back to the ' thopter 's controls and Idaho was thrown against Siona as the craft banked sharply and flew toward a round pocket nestled in the green hills . Idaho peered over Inmeir 's shoulder to look at their destination . At the very center of the pocket lay a village built of the same black stones as the surrounding fences . Idaho saw orchards on some of the slopes above the village , terraced gardens rising in steps toward a small saddle where hawks could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Siona , Idaho asked : " What is this Goygoa ? " " You will see . " Inmeir set the ' thopter into a shallow glide which brought them to a gentle landing on a flat stretch of grass at the edge of the village . One of the Fish Speakers opened the door on the village side . Idaho 's nostrils were immediately assaulted by a heady mixture of aromas  --  crushed grass , animal droppings , the acridity of cooking fires . He slipped out of the ' thopter and looked up a village street where people were emerging from their houses to stare at the visitors . Idaho saw an older woman in a long green dress bend over and whispersomething to a child who immediately turned and went dashing away up the street . " Do you like this place ? " Siona asked . She dropped down beside him . " It appears pleasant . " Siona looked at Inmeir as the pilot and the other Fish Speakers joined them on the grass . " When do we go back to Onn ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My orders are to take you to the Citadel . The Commander goes back . " " I see . " Siona nodded . " When will we leave ? " " At dawn tomorrow . I will see the village leader about quarters . " Inmeir strode off into the village . " Goygoa , " Idaho said . " That 's a strange name . I wonder what this place was in the Dune days ? " " I happen to know , " Siona said . " It is on the old charts as Shuloch , which means haunted place . ' The Oral History says great crimes were committed here before all of the inhabitants were wiped out . " " Jacurutu , " Idaho whispered , recalling the old legends of the water stealers . He glanced around , looking for the evidence of dunes and ridges ; there was nothing  --  only two older men with placid faces returning with Inmeir . The men wore faded blue trousers and ragged shirts . Their feet were bare . " Did you know this place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a legend . " " Some say there are ghosts , " she said , " but I do not believe it . " Inmeir stopped in front of Idaho and motioned the two barefooted men to wait behind her . " The quarters are poor but adequate , " she said , " unless you would care to stay in one of the private residences . " She turned and looked at Siona as she said this . " We will decide later , " Siona said . She took Idaho 's arm . " The Commander and I wish to stroll through Goygoa and admire the sights . "  |p183Inmeir  shaped her mouth to speak , but remained silent . Idaho allowed Siona to lead him past the peering faces of the two local men . " I will send two guards with you , " Inmeir called out . Siona stopped and turned . " Is it not safe in Goygoa ? " " It is very peaceful here , " one of the men said . " Then we will not need guards , " Siona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Again , she led Idaho toward the village . " All right , " Idaho said , disengaging his arm from Siona 's grasp . " What is this place ? " " It is very likely that you will find this a very restful place , " Siona said . " It is not like the old Shuloch at all . Very peaceful . " " You 're up to something , " Idaho said , striding beside her . " What is it ? " " I 've always heard that gholas were full of questions , " Siona said . " I , too , have questions . " " Oh ? " " What was he like in your day , the man Leto ? " " Which one ? " " Yes , I forget there were two  --  the grandfather and our Leto . I mean our Leto , of course . " " He was just a child , that 's all I know . " " The Oral History says one of his early brides came from this vil-lage . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still had a manly shape . It was after the death of his sister but before he began to change into the Worm . The Oral Historysays the brides of Leto vanished into the maze of the Imperial Citadel , never to be seen again except as faces and voices transmitted by holo . He has not had a bride for thousands of years . " They had arrived at a small square at the center of the village , a space about fifty meters on a side and with a low-walled pool of clear water in its center . Siona crossed to the pool 's wall and sat on the rock ledge , patting beside her for Idaho to join her there . Idaho looked around at the village first , noting how people peered out at him from behind curtained windows , how the children pointed and whispered . He turned and stood looking down at Siona . " What is this place ? " " I 've told you . Tell me what Muad'Dib was like . " " He was the best friend a man could ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it calls the caliphate of his heirs The Desposyni , and that has an evil sound . "  |p184She  's baiting me , Idaho thought . He allowed himself a tight smile , wondering at Siona 's motives . She appeared to be waiting for some important event , anxious . . even dreading . . . but with an undertone of something like elation . It was all there . Nothing she said now could be accounted as more than small talk , a way of occupying the moments until . . . until what ? The light sound of running feet intruded on his reverie . Idaho turned and saw a child of perhaps eight years racing toward him out of a side street . The child 's bare feet kicked up little dust geysers as he ran and there was the sound of a woman shouting , a despairing sound somewhere up the street . The runner stopped about ten paces away and stared up at Idaho with a hungering look , an intensity which Idaho found disturbing . The child appeared vaguely familiar  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unfinished face but with hints of the man to be  --  rather high cheekbones , a flat line across the brows . He wore a faded blue singlesuit which betrayed the effects of much laundering but obviously had begun as a garment of excellentmaterial . It had the look of punji cotton woven in a cordlock that did not permit even the frayed edges to unravel . " You 're not my father , " the child said . Whirling away , he raced back up the street and vanished around a corner . Idaho turned and scowled at Siona , almost afraid to ask the question : Was that a child of my predecessor ? He knew the answer withoutasking  --  that familiar face , the genotype carried true . Myself as a child . Realization left him with an empty feeling , a sense of frustration . What is my responsibility ? Siona put both hands over her face and hunched her shoulders . It had not happened at all the way she had imagined it might . She felt betrayed by her own desires for revenge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unworthy of consideration . She had felt him thrown against her in the ' thopter , had seen the obvious emotionson his face . And that child . . . " What happened to my predecessor ? " Idaho asked . His voice came out flat and accusatory . She lowered her hands . There was suppressed rage in his face . " We are not certain , " she said , " but he entered the Citadel one day and never emerged . " " That was his child ? " She nodded . " You 're sure you did not kill my predecessor ? " " I . . . " She shook her head , shocked by the doubts , the latent accusationin him.  | " That child , that is the reason we came here ? " She swallowed . " Yes . " " What am I supposed to do about him ? " She shrugged , feeling soiled and guilty because of her own actions . " What about his mother ? " Idaho asked . " She and the others live up that street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Others ? " " There is an older son . . . a daughter . Will you . . . I mean , I could arrange . . . " " No ! The boy was right . I 'm not his father . " " I 'm sorry , " Siona whispered . " I should not have done this . " " Why did he choose this place ? " Idaho asked . " The father . . . your . . . " " My predecessor ! " " Because this was Irti 's home and she would not leave . That is what people said . " " Irti . . . the mother ? " " Wife , by the old rite , the one from the Oral History . " Idaho looked around at the stone fronts of the buildings whichenclosed the square , the curtained windows , the narrow doors . " Sohe lived here ? " " When he could . " " How did he die , Siona ? " " Truly , I do not know . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sure ! " " How do you know it ? " He centered a probing stare on her face . The intensity of it forced her to look away . " I do not doubt the stories of my ancestors , " she said . " They are told in bits and pieces , a note here , a whispered account there , but I believe them . My father believes them , too ! " " Moneo has said nothing to me of this . " " One thing you can say about the Atreides , " she said . " We 're loyal and that 's a fact . We keep our word . " Idaho opened his mouth to speak , closed it without making asound . Of course ! Siona , too , was Atreides . The thought shook him . He had known it , but he had not accepted it . Siona was some kind ofa rebel , a rebel whose actions were almost sanctioned by Leto . Thelimits of his permission were unclear , but Idaho sensed them . " You must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be tested . " Idaho turned his back on Siona . " You do n't know anything for sure , " he said . " Bits and pieces , ru-mors ! "  |p186Siona  did not respond . " He 's an Atreides ! " Idaho said . " He 's the Worm ! " Siona said and the venom in her voice was almostpalpable . " Your damned Oral History is nothing but a bunch of ancient gossip ! " Idaho accused . " Only a fool would believe it . " " You still trust him , " she said . " That will change . " Idaho whirled and glared at her . " You 've never talked to him ! " " I have . When I was a child . " " You 're still a child . He 's all of the Atreides who were , all of them . It 's a terrible thing , but I knew those people . They were my friends . " Siona only shook her head . Again , Idaho turned away . He felt that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boneless . Without willing it , he began walking across the square and up the street where the boy had gone . Siona came running after him and fell into step , but he ignored her . The street was narrow , enclosed by the one-story stone walls , the doors set back within arched frames , all of the doors closed . The windows were small versions of the doors . Curtains twitched as he passed . At the first cross-street , Idaho stopped and looked to the right where the boy had gone . Two gray-haired women in long black skirts and dark green blouses stood a few paces away down the street , gossipingwith their heads close together . They fell silent when they saw Idaho and stared at him with open curiosity . He returned their stare , then looked down the side-street . It was empty . Idaho turned toward the women , passed them within a pace . They drew closer together and turned to watch him . They looked only once at Siona , then returned their attention to Idaho . Siona moved quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadness ? he wondered . Regret ? Curiosity ? It was difficult to say . He was more curious about the doorways and windows they were passing . " Have you ever been to Goygoa before ? " Idaho asked . " No . " Siona spoke in a subdued voice , as though afraid of it . Why am I walking down this street ? Idaho wondered . Even as he asked himself the question , he knew the answer . This woman , this Irti : What kind of a woman would bring me to Goygoa ? The corner of a curtain on his right lifted and Idaho saw a face  --  the boy from the square . The curtain dropped then was flung aside to reveal a woman standing there . Idaho stared speechlessly at her face ,  |p187sto|p|ped  in a completed step . It was the face of a woman known only to his deepest fantasies  --  a soft oval with penetrating dark eyes , a full and sensuous mouth . . . " Jessica , " he whispered . " What did you say ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of Jessica resurrected out of a past he had believed gone forever , a genetic prank  --  Muad'Dib 's mother recreated in new flesh . The woman closed the curtain , leaving the memory of her features in Idaho 's mind , an after-image which he knew he could never remove . She had been older than the Jessica who had shared their dangerson Dune  --  age-lines beside the mouth and eyes , the body a bit more full . . . More motherly , Idaho told himself . Then : Did I ever tell her . . . who she resembled ? Siona tugged at his sleeve . " Do you wish to go in , to meet her ? " " No . This was a mistake . " Idaho started to turn back the way they had come , but the door of Irti 's house was flung open . A young man emerged and closed the door behind him , turning then to confront Idaho . Idaho guessed the youth 's age at sixteen and there was no denying the parentage  --  that karakul hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , " the youth said . His voice had already deepened into manhood . " Yes . " Idaho found it difficult to speak . " Why have you come ? " the youth asked . " It was not my idea , " Idaho said . He found this easier to say , the words driven by resentment against Siona . The youth looked at Siona . " We have had word that my father is dead . " Siona nodded . The youth returned his attention to Idaho . " Please go away and do not return . You cause pain for my mother . " " Of course , " Idaho said . " Please apologize to the Lady Irti for this intrusion . I was brought here against my will . " " Who brought you ? " " The Fish Speakers , " Idaho said . The youth nodded once , a curt movement of the head . He looked once more at Siona . " I always thought that you Fish Speakers were taught to treat your own more kindly . " With that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door firmly behind him . Idaho turned back the way they had come , grabbing Siona 's armp188as he strode away . She stumbled , then fell into step , disengaging his grasp . " He thought I was a Fish Speaker , " she said . " Of course . You have the look . " He glanced at her . " Why did n't you tell me that Irti was a Fish Speaker ? " " It did n't seem important . " " Oh . " " That 's how they met . " They came to the intersection with the street from the square . Idaho turned away from the square , striding briskly up to the end where the village merged into gardens and orchards . He felt insulated by shock , his awareness recoiling from too much that could not be assimilated . A low wall blocked his path . He climbed over it , heard Siona follow . Trees around them were in bloom , white flowers with orange centers where dark brown insects worked . The air was full of insect buzzing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caladan . He stopped when he reached the crest of a hill where he could turn and look back down at Goygoa 's rectangular neatness . The roofs were flat and black . Siona sat down on the thick grass of the hilltop and embraced her knees . " That was not what you intended , was it ? " Idaho asked . She shook her head and he saw that she was close to tears . " Why do you hate him so much ? " he asked . " We have no lives of our own ! " Idaho looked down at the village . " Are there many villages like this one ? " " This is the shape of the Worm 's Empire ! " " What 's wrong with it ? " " Nothing  --  if that 's all you want . " " You 're saying that this is all he allows ? " " This , a few market cities . . . Onn . I 'm told that even planetary capitals are just big villages . " " And I repeat : What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison ! " " Then leave it . " " Where ? How ? You think we can just get on a Guild ship and go anywhere else , anywhere we want ? " She pointed down toward Goygoawhere the ' thopter could be seen off to one side , the Fish Speakers seated on the grass nearby . " Our jailers wo n't let us leave ! " " They leave , " Idaho said . " They go anywhere they want . "  | " Anywhere the Worm sends them ! " She pressed her face against her knees and spoke , her voice muffled . " What was it like in the old days ? " " It was different , often very dangerous . " He looked around at the walls which set off pastureland , gardens and orchards . " Here on Dune , there were no imaginary lines to show the limits of ownership on the land . It was all the Dukedom of the Atreides . " " Except for the Fremen . " " Yes . But they knew where they belonged  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond where the pan turns white against the sand . " " They could go wherever they wanted ! " " With some limits . " " Some of us long for the desert , " she said . " You have the Sareer . " She lifted her head to glare at him . " That little thing ! " " Fifteen hundred kilometers by five hundred  --  not so little . " Siona got to her feet . " Have you asked the Worm why he confines us this way ? " " Leto 's Peace , the Golden Path to insure our survival . That 's what he says . " " Do you know what he told my father ? I spied on them when I was a child . I heard him . " " What did he say ? " " He said he denies us most crises , to limit our forming forces . He said : People can be sustained by affliction , but I am the affliction now . Gods can become afflictions . ' Those were his words , Duncan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt the accuracy of her recital , but the words failed to stir him . He thought instead of the Corrino he had been ordered to kill . Affliction . The Corrino , descendant of a Family which once had ruled this Empire , had been revealed as a softly fat middleagedman who hungered after power and conspired for spice . Idaho had ordered a Fish Speaker to kill him , an act which had aroused Moneo to a fit of intense questioning . " Why did n't you kill him yourself ? " " I wanted to see how the Fish Speakers performed . " " And your judgement of their performance ? " " Efficient . " But the death of the Corrino had inflicted Idaho with a sense of unreality . A fat little man lying in a pool of his own blood , an undistinguishedshadow among the night shadows of a plastone street . It was unreal . Idaho could remember Muad'Dib saying : " The mind im/poses this framework which it calls reality ? That arbitrary frameworkhas a tendency to be quite independent of what your senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Idaho looked at Siona standing against the orchard background and the green hills of Goygoa . " Let 's go down to the village and find our quarters . I 'd like to be alone . " " The Fish Speakers will put us in the same quarters . " " With them ? " " No , just the two of us together . The reason 's simple enough . The Worm wants me to breed with the great Duncan Idaho . " " I pick my own partners , " Idaho growled . " I 'm sure one of our Fish Speakers would be delighted , " Siona said . She whirled away from him and set off down the hill . Idaho watched her for a moment , the lithe young body swaying like the limbs of the orchard trees in the wind . " I 'm not his stud , " Idaho muttered . " That 's one thing he 'll have to understand . "  |p191As  each day passes , you become increasingly unreal , more alien and remote from what I find myself to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as you differ from me , you lose reality . The more curious I become , the less curious are those who worship me . Religion suppresses curiosity . What I do subtracts from the worshipper . Thus it is that eventually I will do nothing , giving it all back to frightened people who will find themselves on that day alone and forced to act for themselves . ... The Stolen JournalsIt was a sound like no other , the sound of a waiting mob , and it came down the long tunnel to where Idaho marched ahead of the Royal Cart  --  nervous whispers magnified into an ultimate whisper , the shuffling of one gigantic foot , the stirring of an enormous garment . And the smell  --  sweet perspiration mixed with the milky breath of sexual excitement . Inmeir and the others of his Fish Speaker escort had brought Idaho here in the first hour after dawn , coming down to the plaza of Onn while it lay in cold green shadows . They had lifted off immediately after turning him over to other Fish Speakers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siona to the Citadel andthus would miss the ritual of Siaynoq . The new escort , vibrant with repressed emotion , had taken him into a region deep beneath the plaza , a place not on any of the city charts Idaho had studied . It was a maze  --  first one direction and then another through corridors wide enough and high enough to accommodate the Royal Cart . Idaho lost track of directions and fell to reflecting on the preceding night . The sleeping quarters in Goygoa , although Spartan and small , had been comfortable  --  two cots to a room , each room a box with white-washed walls , a single window and a single door . The rooms were strung along a corridor in a building designated as Goygoa 's " Guest House . " And Siona had been right . Without asking if it suited him , Idaho had been quartered with her , Inmeir acting as though this were an accepted thing . When the door closed on them , Siona said : " If you touch me , I will try to kill you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . " I would prefer privacy , " he said . " Consider yourself alone . " He had slept with a light wariness , remembering dangerous nights in the Atreides service , the readiness for combat . The room was seldomtruly dark  --  moonlight coming through the curtained window , even starlight reflecting from the chalk-white walls . He had found himself nervously sensitive to Siona , to the smell of her , the stirrings , her breathing . Several times he had come fully awake to listen , aware on two of those occasions that she , too , was listening . Morning and the flight to Onn had come as a relief . They had brokentheir fast with a drink of cold fruit juice , Idaho glad to enter the predawn darkness for a brisk walk to the ' thopter . He did not speak directly to Siona and he found himself resenting the curious glances of the Fish Speakers . Siona spoke to him only once , leaning out of the ' thopter as he left it in the plaza . " It would not offend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a curious way of putting it . He had felt vaguely embarrassed . " Yes . . . well , certainly . " The new escort had led him away then , coming at last to a terminalin the maze . Leto awaited him there on the Royal Cart . The meeting place was a wide spot in a corridor which stretched off into the converging distance on Idaho 's right . The walls were dark brown streaked with golden lines which glittered in the yellow light of glowglobes . The escort took up positions behind the cart , movingp193smartly and leaving Idaho to stand confronting Leto 's cowled face . " Duncan , you will precede me when we go to Siaynoq , " Leto said . Idaho stared into the dark blue wells of the God Emperor 's eyes , angered by the mystery and secrecy , the obvious air of private excitement in this place . He felt that everything he had been told about Siaynoq only deepened the mystery . " Am I truly the Commander of your Guard , m'Lord ? " Idaho asked , resentment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bestow a signal honor upon you now . Few adult males ever share Siaynoq . " " What happened in the city last night ? " " Bloody violence in some places . It is quite calm this morning , however . " " Casualties ? " " Not worth mentioning . " Idaho nodded . Leto 's prescient powers had warned of some peril to his Duncan . Thus , the flight into the rural safety of Goygoa . " You have been to Goygoa , " Leto said . " Were you tempted to stay ? " " No ! " " Do not be angry with me , " Leto said . " I did not send you to Goygoa . " Idaho sighed . " What was the danger which required that you send me away ? " " It was not to you , " Leto said . " But you excite my guards to excessivedisplays of their abilities . Last night 's activities did not requirethis . " " Oh ? " This thought shocked Idaho . He had never thought of himself as one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the troops . Leaders such as the originalLeto , this one 's grandfather , had inspired by their presence . " You are extremely precious to me , Duncan , " Leto said . " Yes . . . well , I 'm still not your stud ! " " Your wishes will be honored , of course . We will discuss it another time . " Idaho glanced at the Fish Speaker escort , all of them wide-eyed and attentive . " Is there always violence when you come to Onn ? " Idaho asked . " It goes in cycles . The malcontents are quite subdued now . It will be more peaceful for a time . " Idaho looked back at Leto 's inscrutable face . " What happened to my predecessor ? " " Have n't my Fish Speakers told you ? "  | " They say he died in defense of his God . " " And you have heard a contrary rumor . " " What happened ? " " He died because he was too close to me . I did not remove him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place like Goygoa . " " I would have preferred him to live out his days there in peace , but you well know , Duncan , that you are not a seeker after peace . " Idaho swallowed , encountering an odd lump in his throat . " Iwould still like the particulars of his death . He has a family . . . " " You will get the particulars and do not fear for his family . Theyare my wards . I will keep them safely at a distance , You know howviolence seeks me out . That is one of my functions . It is unfortunatethat those I admire and love must suffer because of this . " Idaho pursed his lips , not satisfied with what he heard . " Set your mind at ease , Duncan , " Leto said . " Your predecessordied because he was too close to me . " The Fish Speaker escort stirred restively . Idaho glanced at them , then looked to the right up the tunnel . " Yes , it is time , " Leto said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close ahead of me , Duncan , and I will answer your questionsabout Siaynoq . " Obedient because he could think of no suitable alternative , Idaho turned on his heel and led off the procession . He heard the cart creak into motion behind him , the faint footsteps of the escort following . The cart fell silent with an abruptness which jerked Idaho 's attentionaround . The reason was immediately apparent . " You 're on the suspensors , " he said , returning his attention to the front . " I have retracted the wheels because the women will press close around me , " Leto said . " We ca n't crush their feet . " " What is Siaynoq ? What is it really ? " Idaho asked . " I have told you . It is the Great Sharing . " " Do I smell spice ? " " Your nostrils are sensitive . There is a small amount of melange in the wafers . " Idaho shook his head . Trying to understand this event , Idaho had asked Leto directly at the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Feast of Siaynoq ? " " We share a wafer , no more . Even I partake . " " Is it like the Orange Catholic ritual ? " " Oh , no ! It is not my flesh . It is the sharing . They are remindedp195that they are only female , as you are only male , but I am all . They share with the all . " Idaho had not liked the tone of this . " Only male ? " " Do you know who they lampoon at the Feast , Duncan ? " " Who ? " " Men who have offended them . Listen to them when they talk softly among themselves . " Idaho had taken this as a warning : Do n't offend the Fish Speakers . You incur their wrath at your mortal peril ! Now , as he marched ahead of Leto in the tunnel , Idaho felt that he had heard the words correctly but learned nothing from them . He spoke over his shoulder . " I do n't understand the Sharing . " " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will feel it . My Fish Speakers are the repository of a special knowledge , an unbroken line which only they share . Now , you will partake of it and they will love you for it . Listen to them carefully . They are open to ideas of affinity . Their terms of endearment for each other have no reserva-tions . " More words , Idaho thought . More mystery . He could discern a gradual widening in the tunnel ; the ceiling sloped higher . There were more glowglobes , tuned now into the deep orange . He could see the high arch of an opening about three hundredmeters away , rich red light there in which he could make out glistening faces which swayed gently left and right . Their bodies below the faces presented a dark wall of clothing . The perspiration of excitement was thick here . As he neared the waiting women , Idaho saw a passage through them and a ramp slanting up to a low ledge on his right . A great arched ceiling curved away above the women , a gigantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go up the ramp on your right , " Leto said . " Stop just beyond the center of the ledge and turn to face the women . " Idaho lifted his right hand in acknowledgment . He was emerging into the open space now and the dimensions of this enclosed place awed him . He set his trained eyes the task of estimating the dimensionsas he mounted to the ledge and guessed the hall to be at least eleven hundred meters on a side  --  a square with rounded corners . It was packed with women , and Idaho reminded himself that these were only the chosen representatives of the far scattered Fish Speaker regiments  --  three women from each planet . They stood now , their bodies pressed so closely together that Idaho doubted one of them could fall . They had left only a space about fifty meters wide alongp196the ledge where Idaho now stopped and surveyed the scene . The faces looked up at him  --  faces , faces . Leto stopped his cart just behind Idaho and lifted one of his silverskinnedarms . Immediately , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great hall . Idaho was deafened by it . Surely that sound must be heard throughout the City , he thought . Unless we are too far underground . " My brides , " Leto said . " I welcome you to Siaynoq . " Idaho glanced up at Leto , saw the dark eyes glistening , the radiant expression . Leto had said : " This cursed holiness ! " But he basked in it . Has Moneo ever seen this gathering ? Idaho wondered . It was an odd thought , but Idaho knew its origin . There had to be some other mortal human with whom this could be discussed . The escort had said Moneo was dispatched on " affairs of state " whose details they did not know . Hearing this , Idaho had felt himself sense another element in Leto 's government . The lines of power extended directly from Leto out into the populace , but the lines did not often cross . That required many things , including trusted servants who would acceptresponsibility for carrying out orders without question . " Few see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Is that like the Atreides you knew ? " Idaho looked out over the massed Fish Speakers as these thoughts flitted through his mind . The adulation in their eyes ! The awe ! How had Leto done this ? Why ? " My beloveds , " Leto said . His voice boomed out over the upturnedfaces , carried to the farthest corners by subtle Ixian amplifiers concealed in the Royal Cart . The steaming images of the women 's faces filled Idaho with memory of Leto 's warning . Incur their wrath at your mortal peril ! It was easy to believe that warning in this place . One word from Leto and these women would tear an offender to pieces . They would not question . They would act . Idaho began to feel a new appreciation of these women as an army . Personal peril would not stop them . They served God ! The Royal Cart creaked slightly as Leto arched his front segments upward , lifting his head . " You are the keepers of the faith ! " Leto said . They replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " In me you live without end ! " Leto said . " We are the Infinite ! " they shouted . " I love you as I love no others ! " Leto said.  | " Love ! " they screamed . Idaho shuddered . " I give you my beloved Duncan ! " Leto said . " Love ! " they screamed . Idaho felt his whole body trembling . He felt that he might collapse from the weight of this adulation . He wanted to run away and he wanted to stay and accept this . There was power in this room . Power ! In a lower voice , Leto said : " Change the Guard . " The women bowed their heads , a single movement , unhesitating . From off to Idaho 's right a line of women in white gowns appeared . They marched into the open space below the ledge and Idaho noted that some of them carried babies and small children , none more than a year or two old . From the outline explanation provided him earlier , Idaho recognizedthese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fish Speakers . Some would become priestesses and some would spend full time as mothers . . . but none would truly leave Leto 's service . As he looked down on the children , Idaho thought how the buried memory of this experience must be impressed on any of the male children . They would carry the mystery of it throughout their lives , a memory lost to consciousness but always present , shading responses from this moment onward . The last of the newcomers came to a stop below Leto and looked up at him . The other women in the hall now lifted their faces and focused on Leto . Idaho glanced left and right . The whiteclad women filled the space below the ledge for at least five hundred meters in both directions . Some of them lifted their children toward Leto . The awe and submissionwas something absolute . If Leto ordered it , Idaho sensed , these women would smash their babies to death against the ledge . They would do anything ! Leto lowered his front segments onto the cart , a gentle rippling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a soft caress . " I give you the reward which your faith and service have earned . Ask and it shall be given . " The entire hall reverberated to the response : " It shall be given ! " " What is mine is thine , " Leto said . " What is mine is thine , " the women shouted . " Share with me now , " Leto said , " the silent prayer for my intercessionin all things  --  that humankind may never end . " As one , every head in the hall bowed . The whiteclad women cra/died their children close , looking down at them . Idaho felt the silent unity , a force which sought to enter him and take him over . He opened his mouth wide and breathed deeply , fighting against something which he sensed as a physical invasion . His mind searched frantically for something to which he could cling , something to shield him . These women were an army whose force and union Idaho had not suspected . He knew he did not understand this force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed . This was what Leto had created . Leto 's words from a meeting at the Citadel came back to Idaho : " Loyalty in a male army fastens onto the army itself rather than onto the civilization which fosters the army . Loyalty in a female army fastensonto the leader . " Idaho stared out across the visible evidence of Leto 's creation , seeingthe penetrating accuracy of those words , fearing that accuracy . He offers me a share in this , Idaho thought . His own response to Leto 's words struck Idaho now as puerile . " I do n't see the reason , " Idaho had said . " Most people are not creatures of reason . " " No army , male or female , guarantees peace ! Your Empire is n't peaceful ! You only . . . " " My Fish Speakers have provided you with our histories ? " " Yes , but I 've also walked about in your city and I 've watched your people . Your people are aggressive ! " " You see , Duncan ? Peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golden Path . . . " " Is not precisely peace . It is tranquility , a fertile ground for the growth of rigid classes and many other forms of aggression . " " You talk riddles ! " " I talk accumulated observations which tell me that the peaceful posture is the posture of the defeated . It is the posture of the victim . Victims invite aggression . " " Your damned enforced tranquility ! What good does it do ? " " If there is no enemy , one must be invented . The military force which is denied an external target always turns against its own people . " " What 's your game ? " " I modify the human desire for war . " " People do n't want war ! " " They want chaos . War is the most readily available form of chaos . "  | " I do n't believe any of this ! You 're playing some dangerous game of your own . " " Very dangerous . I address ancient wellsprings of human behavior to redirect them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survival . But I assure you that my Golden Path endures . " " You have n't suppressed antagonism ! " " I dissipate energies in one place and point them toward another place . What you can not control , you harness . " " What 's to keep your female army from taking over ? " " I am their leader . " As he looked out over the massed women in the great hall , Idaho could not deny the focus of leadership . He saw also that part of this adulation was directed at his own person . The temptation in this held him fixated  --  anything he wanted from them . . . anything ! The latent power in this great hall was explosive . This realization forced him into a deeper questioning of Leto 's earlier words . Leto had said something about exploding violence . Even as he watched the women at their silent prayer , Idaho recalled what Leto had said : " Men are susceptible to class fixations . They create layered societies . The layered society is an ultimate invitation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Women never do this ? " " Not unless they are almost completely male dominated or locked into a male-role model . " " The sexes ca n't be that different ! " " But they are . Women make common cause based on their sex , a cause which transcends class and caste . That is why I let my women hold the reins . " Idaho was forced to admit that these praying women held the reins . What part of that power would he pass into my hands ? The temptation was monstrous ! Idaho found himself trembling with it . With chilling abruptness , he realized that this must be Leto 's intention  --  to tempt melOn the floor of the great hall , the women finished their prayer and lifted their gaze to Leto . Idaho felt that he had never before seen such rapture in human faces  --  not in the ecstasy of sex , not in gloriousvictory-at-arms  --  nowhere had he seen anything to approach this intense adulation . " Duncan Idaho stands beside me today , " Leto said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may hear it . Duncan ? " Idaho felt a physical chill shoot through his intestines . Leto gavep200him a simple choice : Declare your loyalty to the God Emperor or die ! If I sneer , vacillate or object in any way , the women will kill me with their own hands . A deep anger suffused Idaho . He swallowed , cleared his throat , then : " Let no one question my loyalty . I am loyal to the Atreides . " He heard his own voice booming out over the room , amplified by Leto 's Ixian device . The effect startled Idaho . " We share ! " the women screamed . " We share ! We share ! " " We share , " Leto said . Young Fish Speaker trainees , identifiable by their short green robes , swarmed into the hall from all sides , little knots of movement which eddied throughout the pattern of the adoring faces . Each trainee carried a tray piled high with tiny brown wafers . As the trays moved through the throng , hands reached out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . Each hand took a wafer and held it aloft . When a tray bearer came to the ledge and lifted her burden toward Idaho , Leto said : " Take two and pass one into my hand . " Idaho knelt and took two wafers . The things felt crisp and fragile . He stood and passed one gently to Leto . In a stentorian voice , Leto asked : " Has the new Guard been chosen ? " " Yes , Lord ! " the women shouted . " Do you keep my faith ? " " Yes , Lord ! " " Do you walk the Golden Path ? " " Yes , Lord ! " The vibration of the women 's shouts sent shock waves through Idaho , stunning him . " Do we share ? " Leto asked . " Yes , Lord ! " As the women responded , Leto popped his wafer into his mouth . Each mother below the ledge took a bite from her wafer and offered the rest to her child . The massed Fish Speakers behind the whiteclad women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eat your wafer , " Leto said . Idaho slipped the thing into his mouth . His ghola body had not been conditioned to the spice but memory spoke to his senses . The wafer tasted faintly bitter with a soft undertone of melange . The taste swept old memories through Idaho 's awareness  --  meals in sietch , ban/quets at the Atreides Residency . . . the way spice flavors permeated everything in the old days . As he swallowed the wafer , Idaho grew conscious of the stillness in the hall , a breath-held quiet into which came a loud click from Leto 's cart . Idaho turned and sought the source of the sound . Leto had opened a compartment in the bed of his cart and was removing a crystal box from it . The box glowed with a blue-gray inner light . Leto placed the box on the bed of his cart , opened the glowing lid and removed a crysknife . Idaho recognized the blade immediately  --  the hawk engraved on the handle 's butt , the green jewels at the hilt . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the sight of this blade . He stared at it as though the image in his eyes might reproduce the originalowner . Leto lifted the blade and held it high , revealing the elegant curve and milky iridescence . " The talisman of our lives , " Leto said . The women remained silent , raptly attentive . " The knife of Muad'Dib , " Leto said . " The tooth of Shai-Hulud . Will Shai-Hulud come again ? " The response was a subdued murmur made deeply powerful by contrast with the previous shouting . " Yes , Lord . " Idaho returned his attention to the enraptured faces of the Fish Speakers . " Who is Shai-Hulud ? " Leto asked . Again , that deep murmur : " You , Lord . " Idaho nodded to himself . Here was undeniable evidence that Leto had tapped into a monstrous reservoir of power never before unleashed in quite this way . Leto had said it but the words were a meaningless noise compared to the thing seen and felt in this great hall . Leto 's words came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for this moment to cloak themselves in their true meaning . Idaho recalled that they had been in the crypt , that dank and shadowy place which Leto seemed to find so attractive but which Idaho found so repellent  --  the dust of centuries there and the odors of ancient decay . " I have been forming this human society , shaping it for more than three thousand years , opening a door out of adolescence for the entirespecies , " Leto had said . " Nothing you say explains a female army ! " Idaho had protested . " Rape is foreign to women , Duncan . You ask for a sex-rooted behavioral difference ? There 's one . "  | " Stop changing the subject ! " " I do not change it . Rape was always the pay-off in male military conquest . Males did not have to abandon any of their adolescent fantasieswhile engaging in rape . " Idaho recalled the glowering anger which had come over him at this thrust . " My houris tame the males , " Leto said . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity . " Idaho stared wordlessly at Leto 's cowled face . " To tame , " Leto said . " To fit into some orderly survival pattern . Women learned it at the hands of men ; now men learn it at the hands of women . " " But you said . . . " " My houris often submit to a form of rape at first only to convert this into a deep and binding mutual dependence . " " Dammit ! You 're . . . " " Binding , Duncan ! Binding . " " I do n't feel bound to . . . " " Education takes time . You are the ancient norm against which the new can be measured . " Leto 's words momentarily flushed Idaho of all emotion except a deep sense of loss . " My houris teach maturation , " Leto said . " They know that they must supervise the maturation of males . Through this they find their own maturation . Eventually , houris merge into wives and mothers and we wean the violent drives away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it to believe it ! " " You will see it at the Great Sharing . " As he stood beside Leto in the hall of Siaynoq , Idaho admitted to himself that he had seen something of enormous power , something which might create the kind of human universe Leto 's words projected . Leto was restoring the crysknife to its box , returning the box to its compartment in the bed of the Royal Cart . The women watched in silence , even the small children quiet  --  everyone subdued by the force which could be felt in this great hall . Idaho looked down at the children , knowing from Leto 's explanationthat these children would be rewarded with positions of power  --  male or female , each in a puissant niche . The male children would be female-dominated throughout their lives , making ( in Leto 's words ) " an easy transition from adolescence into breeding males . " Fish Speakers and their progeny lived lives " possessed of a certain excitement not available to most others . "  |p203What  will happen to Irti 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watch his whiteclad wife share in Leto 's ritual ? What does Leto offer me here ? With that female army , an ambitious commander could take over Leto 's Empire . Or could he ? No . . . not while Leto lived . Leto said the women were not militarily aggressive " by nature . " He said : " I do not foster that in them . They know a cyclical patternwith a Royal Festival every ten years , a changing of the Guard , a blessing for the new generation , a silent thought for fallen sisters and loved ones gone forever . Siaynoq after Siaynoq marches onward in predictable measure . The change itself becomes non-change . " Idaho lifted his gaze from the women in white and their children . He looked across the mass of silent faces , telling himself that this was only a small core of that enormous female force which spread its feminine web across the Empire . He could believe Leto 's words : " The power does not weaken . It grows stronger every decade . " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leto who was lifting his hands in benediction over the hall of his houris . " We will move among you now , " Leto said . The women below the ledge opened a path , pressing backward . The path opened deeper into the throng like a fissure spreading through the earth after some tremendous natural upheaval . " Duncan , you will precede me , " Leto said . Idaho swallowed in a dry throat . He put a palm on the lip of the ledge and dropped down into the open space , moving out into the fissure because he knew only that could end this trial . A quick glance backward showed him Leto 's cart drifting majesticallydown on its suspensors . Idaho turned and quickened his pace . The women narrowed the path through their ranks . It was done in an odd stillness , with fixity of attention  --  first on Idaho and then on that gross pre-worm body riding behind Idaho on the Ixian cart . As Idaho marched stoically ahead , women reached from all sides to touch him , to touch Leto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the restrained passion in their touch and knew the deepest fear in his experience.  |p204The  problem of leadership is inevitably : Who will play God ?  --  Muad'Dib , From the Oral HistoryHwi Noree followed a young Fish Speaker guide down a wide ramp which spiraled into the depths of Onn . The summons from the Lord Leto had come in late evening of the Festival 's third day , interruptinga development which had taxed her ability to maintain emoq tionalbalance . , Her first assistant , Othwi Yake , was not a pleasant man  --  a sandyhairedcreature with a long , narrow face and eyes which never looked long at anything and never ever looked directly into the eyes of someone he addressed . Yake had presented her with a single sheet of memerase paper containing what he described as " a summation of recently reported violence in the Festival City . " Standing close to the desk at which she was seated , he had stared down somewhere to her left and said : " Fish Speakers are slaughteringFace Dancers throughout the City . " He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded.  | " It is said that the Bene Tleilax made an attempt on the God Emperor'slife . " A thrill of fear shot through her . She sat back and glanced around the ambassadorial office  --  a round room with a single half-circle desk which concealed the controls for many Ixian devices beneath its highly polished surface . The room was a darkly important-appearing place with brown wood panels covering instruments which shielded it from spying . There were no windows . Trying not to show her upset , Hwi looked up at Yake . " And the Lord Leto is . . . " " The attempt on his life appears to have been totally without effect . But it might explain that flogging . " " Then you think there was such an attempt ? " " Yes . " The Fish Speaker from the Lord Leto entered at that moment , hard on the announcement of her presence in the outer office . She was followed by a Bene Gesserit crone , a person she introduced as " The Reverend Mother Anteac . " Anteac stared intently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with smooth , almost childlikefeatures , delivered her message : " He told me to remind you : Return quickly if I summon you . ' He summons you . " Yake began fidgeting as the Fish Speaker spoke . He darted his attentionall around the room as though looking for something which was not there . Hwi paused only to pull a dark blue robe over her gown , instructing Yake to remain in the office until she returned . In orange evening light outside the Embassy , on a street oddly empty of other traffic , Anteac looked at the Fish Speaker and said simply : " Yes . " Anteac left them then and the Fish Speaker had brought Hwi through empty streets to a tall , windowless building whose depths contained this down-plunging spiral ramp . The tight curves of the ramp made Hwi dizzy . Brilliant tiny white glowglobes drifted in the central well , illuminating a purple-green vine with elephantine leaves . The vine was suspended on shimmering golden wires . The soft black surface of the ramp swallowed the sounds of their feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the movements of her robe . " Where are you taking me ? " Hwi asked . " To the Lord Leto . " " I know , but where is he ? " " In his private room . " " It 's awfully far down . "  | " Yes , the Lord often prefers the depths . " " It makes me dizzy walking around and around like this . " " It helps if you do not look at the vine . " " What is that plant ? " " It is called a Tunyon Vine and is supposed to have absolutely no smell . " " I 've never heard of it . Where does it come from ? " " Only the Lord Leto knows . " They walked on in silence , Hwi trying to understand her own feelings . The God Emperor filled her with sadness . She could sense the man in him , the man who might have been . Why had such a man chosen this course for his life ? Did anyone know ? Did Moneo know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Idaho  --  such a physically attractive man . So intense ! She could feel herself drawn to him . If only Leto had the body and appearance of Idaho . She knew then that she could not discuss Leto 's change with Idaho . Moneo , though  --  that was another matter . She looked at the back of her Fish Speaker escort . " Can you tell me about Moneo ? " Hwi asked . The Fish Speaker glanced back over her shoulder , an odd expression in her pale blue eyes  --  apprehension or some bizarre form of awe . " Is something wrong ? " Hwi asked . The Fish Speaker returned her attention to the downward spiral of the ramp . " The Lord said you would ask about Moneo , " she said . " Then tell me about him . " " What is there to say ? He is the Lord 's closest confidant . " " Closer even than Duncan Idaho ? " " Oh , yes . Moneo is an Atreides . " " Moneo came to me yesterday , " Hwi said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor . Moneo said the God Emperoris capable of doing anything , anything at all if it is thought to be instructive . " " Many believe this , " the Fish Speaker said . " You do not believe it ? " Hwi asked the question as the ramp rounded a final turn and opened into a small anteroom with an arched entrance only a few steps away . " The Lord Leto will receive you immediately , " the Fish Speaker said . She turned back up the ramp then without speaking of her own belief . Hwi stepped through the arch and found herself in a low-ceilingedp207room . It was much smaller than the audience chamber . The air felt crisp and dry . Pale yellow light came from a concealed source at the upper corners . She allowed her eyes to adjust to the lowered illumination , noting carpets and soft cushions scattered around a low mound of . . . She put a hand to her mouth as the mound moved , realizing then that it was the Lord Leto on his cart , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the room provided this feature . It made him less imposing to human guests , less overpoweringby his physical elevation . Nothing could be done , however , about his length and the inescapable mass of his body except to keep them in shadows , throwing most of the light onto his face and hands . " Come in and sit down , " Leto said . He spoke in a low voice , pleasantly conversational . Hwi crossed to a red cushion only a few meters in front of Leto 's face and sat on it . Leto watched her movements with obvious pleasure . She wore a dark golden gown and her hair was tied back in braids which made her face appear fresh and innocent . " I have sent your message to Ix , " she said . " And I have told them that you wish to know my age . " " Perhaps they will answer , " he said . " Their answer may even be truthful . " " I would like to know when I was born , all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know why this interests you . " " Everything about you interests me . " " They will not like it that you make me the permanent Ambas-sador . " " Your masters are a curious mixture of punctilio and laxity , " he said . " I do not suffer fools gladly . " " You think me a fool , Lord ? " " Malky was not a fool ; neither are you , my dear . " " I have not heard from my uncle in years . Sometimes I wonder if he still lives . " " Perhaps we will learn that as well . Did Malky ever discuss with you my practice of Taquiyya ? " She thought about this a moment , then : " It was called Ketman among the ancient Fremen ? " " Yes . It is the practice of concealing the identity when revealing it might be harmful . " " I recall it now . He told me you wrote pseudonymous histories , some of them quite famous . " " That was the occasion when we discussed Taquiyya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord ? "  | " To avoid other subjects . Did you know that I wrote the books of Noah Arkwright ? " She could not suppress a chuckle . " How amusing , Lord . I was required to read about his life . " " I wrote that account , too . What secrets were you asked to wrest from me ? " She did not even blink at his strategic change of subject . " They are curious about the inner workings of the religion of the Lord Leto . " " Are they now ? " " They wish to know how you took religious control away from the Bene Gesserit . " " No doubt hoping to repeat my performance for themselves ? " " I 'm sure that 's in their minds , Lord . " " Hwi , you are a terrible representative of the Ixians . " " I am your servant , Lord . " " Have you no curiosities of your own ? " " I fear that my curiosities might disturb you , " she said . He stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , you are right . Weshould avoid more intimate conversation for now . Would you likeme to talk about the Sisterhood ? " " Yes , that would be good . Do you know that I met one of the Bene Gesserit delegation today ? " " That would be Anteac . " " I found her frightening , " she said . " You have nothing to fear from Anteac . She went to your Embassyat my command . Were you aware that you had been invaded by Face Dancers ? " Hwi gasped , then held herself still while a cold sensation filled her breast . " Othwi Yake ? " she asked . " You suspected ? " " It 's just that I did not like him , and I had been told that . . . " She shrugged , then , as realization swept over her : " What has happened to him ? " " The original ? He is dead . That 's the usual Face Dancer practice in such circumstances . My Fish Speakers have explicit orders to leave no Face Dancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but tears trickled down her cheeks . This explainedthe empty streets , Anteac 's enigmatic " Yes . " It explained many things . " I will provide Fish Speaker assistance for you until you can make other arrangements , " Leto said . " My Fish Speakers will guard you well . "  |p209Hwi  shook the tears from her face . The Inquisitors of Ix would react with rage against Tleilaxu . Would Ix believe her report ? Everyonein her Embassy taken over by Face Dancers ! It was difficult to believe . " Everyone ? " she asked . " The Face Dancers had no reason to leave any of your original people alive . You would have been next . " She shuddered . " They delayed , " he said , " because they knew they would have to copy you with a precision to defy my senses . They are not sure about my abilities . " " Then Anteac . . . " " The Sisterhood and I share an ability to detect Face Dancers . And Anteac . . . well , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one trusts the Tleilaxu , " she said . " Why have n't they been wiped out long ago ? " " Specialists have their uses as well as their limitations . You surprise me , Hwi . I had not suspected you could be that bloody-minded . " " The Tleilaxu . . . they are too cruel to be human . They are n't human ! " " I assure you that humans can be just as cruel . I myself have been cruel on occasion . " " I know , Lord . " " With provocation , " he said . " But the only people I have consideredeliminating are the Bene Gesserit . " Her shock was too great for words . " They are so close to what they should be and yet so far , " he said . She found her voice . " But the Oral History says . . . " " The Religion of the Reverend Mothers , yes . Once they designed specific religions for specific societies . They called it engineering . How does that strike you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mistake . Even after all the grand attemptsat ecumenism there were countless gods , minor deities and would-be prophets throughout the Empire . " " You changed that , Lord . " " Somewhat . But gods die hard , Hwi . My monotheism dominates , but the original pantheon remains ; it has gone underground in various disguises . " " Lord , I sense in your words . . . a . . . " She shook her head . " Am I as coldly calculating as the Sisterhood ? " She nodded.  | " It was the Fremen who deified my father , the great Muad'Dib . Although he does n't really care to be called great . " " But were the Fremen . . . " " Were they right ? My dearest Hwi , they were sensitive to the uses of power and they were greedy to maintain their ascendancy . " " I find this . . . disturbing , Lord . " " I can see that . You do n't like the idea that becoming a god could be that simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It sounds much too casual , Lord . " Her voice had a remote and testing quality . " I assure you that anyone could not do it . " " But you imply that you inherited your godhood from . . . " " Never suggest that to a Fish Speaker , " he said . " They react violentlyagainst heresy . " She tried to swallow in a dry throat . " I say this only to protect you , " he said . Her voice was faint : " Thank you , Lord . " " My godhood began when I told my Fremen I no longer could give the death-water to the tribes . You know about the death-water ? " " In the Dune days , the water recovered from the bodies of the dead , " she said . " Ahhh , you have read Noah Arkwright . " She managed a faint smile . " I told my Fremen the water would be consecrated to a Supreme Deity , left nameless . Fremen were still allowed to control this water through my largesse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . " " Very ! And I , as delegate of this nameless deity , held loose control of that precious water for almost three hundred years . " She chewed at her lower lip . " It still sounds calculating ? " he asked . She nodded . " It was . When it came time to consecrate my sister 's water , I performeda miracle . The voices of all the Atreides spoke from Ghani 's urn . Thus , my Fremen discovered that I was their Supreme Deity . " Hwi spoke fearfully , her voice full of puzzled uncertainties at this revelation . " Lord , are you telling me that you are not really a god ? " " I am telling you that I do not play hide-and-seek with death . " She stared at him for several minutes before responding in a way which assured him that she understood his deeper meaning . It was a reaction which only intensified her endearment to him . " Your death will not be like other deaths , " she said . " Precious Hwi , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear the judgment of a true Supreme Deity , " she said . " Do you judge me , Hwi ? " " No , but I fear for you . " " Think on the price I pay , " he said . " Every descendant part of me will carry some of my awareness locked away within it , lost and helpless . " She put both hands over her mouth and stared at him . " This is the horror which my father could not face and which he tried to prevent : the infinite division and subdivision of a blind iden-tity . " She lowered her hands and whispered : " You will be conscious ? " " In a way . . . but mute . A little pearl of my awareness will go with every sandworm and every sandtrout  --  knowing yet unable to move a single cell , aware in an endless dream . " She shuddered . Leto watched her try to understand such an existence . Could she imagine the final clamor when the subdivided bits of his identity grappled for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Could she sense the wrenching silence which would followthat awful fragmentation ? " Lord , they would use this knowledge against you were I to reveal it . " " Will you tell ? " " Of course not ! " She shook her head slowly from side to side . Why had he accepted this terrible transformation ? Was there no es-cape ? Presently , she said : " The machine which writes your thoughts , could it not be attuned to ... " " To a million of me ? To a billion ? To more ? My dear Hwi , none of those knowing-pearls will be truly me . " Her eyes filmed with tears . She blinked and inhaled a deep breath . Leto recognized the Bene Gesserit training in this , the way she accepteda flow of calmness . " Lord , you have made me terribly afraid . " " And you do not understand why I have done this . " " Is it possible for me to understand ? " " Oh , yes . Many could understand it . What people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach me what to do ? " " You already know . " She absorbed this silently , then : " It has something to do with your religion . I can feel it . "  |p212Leto  smiled . " I can forgive your Ixian masters almost anything for the precious gift of you . Ask and you shall receive . " She leaned toward him , rocking forward on her pillow . " Tell me about the inner workings of your religion . " I " You will know all of me soon enough , Hwi . I promise it . Just remember that sun worship among our primitive ancestors was not far off the mark . " " Sun . . . worship ? " She rocked backward . " That sun which controls all of the movement but which can not be touched  --  that sun is death . " " Your . . . death ? " " Any religion circles like a planet around a sun which it must use for its energy , upon which it depends for its very existence . " Her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see in your sun , Lord ? " " A universe of many windows through which I may peer . Whateverthe window frames , that is what I see . " " The future ?

" You saw a thing which this  --  " she gesturedat his long , ribbed body  --  " prevents . " " Do you find it in you to believe that this may be , in some small way , holy ? " he asked . She could only nod her head . " If you share it all with me , " he said , " I warn you that it will be a terrible burden . " " Will it make your burden lighter , Lord ? " " Not lighter , but easier to accept . " " Then I will share . Tell me , Lord . " " Not yet , Hwi . You must be patient a while longer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only that my Duncan Idaho grows impatient , " Leto said . " I must deal with him . " She glanced backward , but the small room remained empty . " Do you wish me to leave now ? " " I wish you would never leave me . " I , She stared at him , noting the intensity of his regard , a hungry emptiness in his expression which filled her with sadness . " Lord , why do you tell me your secrets ? " " I would not ask you to be the bride of a god . " Her eyes went wide with shock . " Do not answer , " he said.  |p213Barely  moving her head , she sent her gaze along the shadowy length of his body . " Do not search for parts of me which no longer exist , " he said . " Some forms of physical intimacy are no longer possible for me .

I will tell you then about the thing which I prevent . " " I am frightened , Lord , more frightened than I ever imagined I could be . " " Do not fear me . I can be nothing but gentle with my gentle Hwi . As for other dangers , my Fish Speakers will shield you with their own bodies . They dare not let harm come to you ! " Hwi lifted herself to her feet and stood trembling . Leto saw how deeply his words had affected her and he felt the pain of it . Hwi 's eyes glistened with tears . She clasped her hands tightly to still the trembling . He knew she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he asked , her response would be the response of his Fish Speakers : " Yes , Lord . " It came to Leto that if she could change places with him , take up his burden , she would offer herself . The fact that she could not do this added to her pain . She was intelligence built on profound sensitivity , without any of Malky 's hedonistic weaknesses . She was frighteningin her perfection . Everything about her reaffirmed his awareness that she was precisely the kind of woman who , if he had grown to normal manhood , he would have wanted ( No ! Demanded ! ) as his mate . And the Ixians knew it . " Leave me now , " he whispered.  |p214I  am both father and mother to my people .

Thus , you are born.  --  The Stolen Journals " My Fish Speakers tell me that you went to the Citadel immediately after Siaynoq , " Leto said . He stared accusingly at Idaho , who stood near where Hwi had sat only an hour ago . Such a small passage of time  --  yet Leto felt the emptiness as centuries . " I needed time to think , " Idaho said . He looked into the shadowy pit where Leto 's cart rested . " And to talk to Siona ? " " Yes . " Idaho lifted his gaze to Leto 's face . " But you asked for Moneo , " Leto said . " Do they report on every movement I make ? " Idaho demanded . " Not every movement . "  | " Sometimes people need to be alone . " " Of course . But do not blame the Fish Speakers for being concernedabout you . " " Siona says she is to be tested ! " " Was that why you asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Moneo knows .

" " The ghola 's lot is not easy , " Leto said . " Some lives are harder than others . " " I do n't need any juvenile philosophy ! " " What do you need , Duncan ? " " I need to know some things . " " Such as ? " " I do n't understand any of these people around you ! Without showing any surprise about it , Moneo tells me that Siona was part of a rebellion against you . His own daughter !

" " I am testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't understand your government , your Empire , anything . The more I find out , the more I realize that I do n't know what 's going on . " " How fortunate that you have discovered the way to wisdom , " Leto said . " What ? " Idaho 's baffled outrage raised his voice to a battlefield roar which filled the small room . Leto smiled . " Duncan , have I not told you that when you think you know something , that is a most perfect barrier against learning ? " " Then tell me what 's going on . " " My friend Duncan Idaho is acquiring a new habit . He is learning always to look beyond what he thinks he knows . " " All right , all right . " Idaho nodded his head slowly in time to the words . " Then what 's beyond letting me take part in that Siaynoq thing ? " " I am binding the Fish Speakers to the Commander of my Guard . " " And I have to fight them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to stop for an orgy . And the ones who brought me back here when you . . .

" Idaho took several deep breaths , then : " When I tell them no , ' they act hurt at first and then they treat me like some damned  --  " he shook his head  --  " holy man or something . " " Do n't they obey you ? " " They do n't question anything . . . unless it 's contrary to your orders . I did n't want to come back here . " " Yet they brought you .

" " You spoke to her ? " " I asked her what she was doing here . She said she was choosing sides . " A burst of laughter erupted from Leto . " Oh , my , " he said . " She is so good .

The formation of a biological community without a functioning , supportive social community leads to havoc . Whole worlds have become single biological communities without an interrelated social structure and this has always led to ruin . It becomes dramatically instructive under overcrowdedconditions . The ghetto is lethal . Psychic stresses of overcrowding create pressures which will erupt . The city is an attempt to manage these forces . The social forms by which cities make the attempt are worth study . Remember that there exists a certain malevolence about the formation of any social order . It is the struggle for existence by an artificial entity . Despotism and slavery hover at the edges . Many injuries occur and , thus , the need for laws . The law develops its own power structure , creating more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by cooperation , not by confrontation . The summons to cooperate identifies the healer . ... The Stolen Journalsp222Moneo entered Leto 's small chamber with evident agitation . He actually preferred this meeting place because the God Emperor 's cart lay in a depression from which a deadly attack by the Worm would be more difficult , and there was the undeniable fact that Leto allowedhis majordomo to descend in an Ixian tube-lift rather than via that interminable ramp . But Moneo felt that the news he brought this morning was guaranteed to arouse The Worm Who Is God . How to present it ? Dawn lay only an hour past , the fourth Festival Day , a fact Moneo could greet with equanimity only because it brought him that much nearer the end of these tribulations . Leto stirred as Moneo entered the small chamber . Illumination came on at his signal , focusing only on his face . " Good morning , Moneo , " he said . " My guard tells me you insisted on entering immediately . Why ? " The danger , Moneo knew from experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon . " I have spent some time with the Reverend Mother Anteac , " he said . " Although she keeps it well hidden , I 'm sure she is a Mentat . " " Yes . The Berle Gesserit were bound to disobey me sometime . This form of disobedience amuses me . " " Then you will not punish them ? " " Moneo , I am ultimately the only parent my people have . A parentmust be generous as well as severe . " He 's in a good mood , Moneo thought . A small sigh escaped Moneo , at which Leto smiled . " Anteac objected when I told her you had ordered an amnesty for a selected few Face Dancers among our captives . " " I have a Festive use for them , " Leto said . " Lord ? " " I will tell you later . Let 's get to the news which brings you burstingin upon me at this hour . " " I . . ahhh . . . " Moneo chewed at his upper lip .

Perhaps we should use the Tleilaxu term : a cellular restructuring . The . . . ahhh , experiment was conducted within some sort of shielding device which the Guildsmen assured them your powers could not penetrate . "  | " And the result ? " Leto felt that he was asking the question in a cold vacuum . " They are not certain . Tleilaxu were not permitted to witness . However , they did observe that Malky entered this . . . ahhh , chamberand that he emerged later with an infant . " " Yes ! I know ! " " You do ? " Moneo was puzzled . " By inference .

And what do you deduce from this , Moneo ? " " There is a deep purpose built into the new Ixian Ambassador . " " Certainly there is . Moneo , has it not struck you as odd how muchHwi , the gentle Hwi , represents a mirror of the redoubtable Malky ? His opposite in everything , including sex . " " I had not thought of that , Lord . " " I have . " " I will have her sent back to Ix immediately , " Moneo said . " You will do nothing of the kind ! " " But , Lord , if they . . . " " Moneo , I have observed that you seldom turn your back on danger . Others often do , but you  --  seldom . Why would you have me engagein such an obvious stupidity ? " Moneo swallowed . " Good . I like it when you recognize the error of your ways , " Leto said . " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you express your gratitude sincerely , as you have just done . Now , Anteac was with you when you heard these revelations ? " " As you ordered , Lord . " " Excellent . That will stir things up a bit . You will leave now and go to the Lady Hwi . You will tell her that I desire to see her immediately . This will disturb her . She is thinking that we will not meet again until I summon her to the Citadel . I want you to quiet her fears . " " In what way , Lord ? " Leto spoke sadly : " Moneo , why do you ask advice on something at which you are an expert ? Calm her and bring her here reassured of my kindly intentions toward her . " " Yes , Lord . " Moneo bowed and backed away a step.  | " One moment , Moneo ! " Moneo stiffened , his gaze fixed on Leto 's face . " You are puzzled , Moneo , " Leto said . " Sometimes you do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all-prescient ? You bring me these little dibs and dabs and you wonder : Does he already know this ? If he does , why do I bother ? But I have ordered you to report such things , Moneo . Is your obedience not instructive ? " Moneo started to shrug and thought better of it . His lips trembled . " Time can also be a place , Moneo , " Leto said . " Everything dependsupon where you are standing , on where you look or what you hear . The measure of it is found in consciousness itself . " After a long silence , Moneo ventured : " Is that all , Lord ? " " No , it is not all . Siona will receive today a package delivered to her by a Guild courier . Nothing is to interfere with delivery of that package . Do you understand ? " " What is . . what is in the package , Lord ? " " Some translations , reading matter which I wish her to see . You will do nothing to interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How . . . how did you know what I feared was in the . . . " " Because you fear the spice . It could extend your life , but you avoid it .

" " Ahhh , yes , and for the Atreides , melange may roll the mystery of Time through a peculiar process of internal revelation . " " I have only to remember the way you tested me , Lord . " " Do you not see the necessity for you to sense the Golden Path ? " " That is not what I fear , Lord . " " You fear the other astonishment , the thing which made me make my choice .

The Guild navigators need it . And without it , the Bene Gesserit would degenerate into a helpless band of whining females ! "  | " We must live with it or without it , Lord . I know that . " " Very perceptive , Moneo . But you choose to live without it . " " Do I not have that choice , Lord ? " " For now . " " Lord , what do you . . .

They describe it by its intended use , by its dilution , by its age , by whether it came through honest purchase , through theft or conquest , whether it was the dower gift for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways is it named . What do you make of this , Moneo ? " " We are offered many choices , Lord . " " Only where the spice is concerned ? " Moneo 's brows wrinkled in thought , then : " No . " " You so seldom say no ' in my presence , " Leto said . " I enjoy watching your lips form around the word . " Moneo 's mouth twitched in an attempted smile . Leto spoke briskly : " Well ! You must go now to the Lady Hwi . I will give you one parting piece of advice which may help . " Moneo paid studious attention to Leto 's face . " Drug knowledge originated mostly with males because they tend to be more venturesome  --  an outgrowth of male aggression . You 've read your Orange Catholic Bible , thus you know the story of Eve and the apple . Here 's an interesting fact about that story : Eve was not the first to pluck and sample the apple . Adam was first and he learned by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you something about how our societies find a structural necessity for sub-groups . " Moneo tipped his head slightly to the left . " Lord , how does this help me ? " " It will help you with the Lady Hwi ! "  |p226The  singular multiplicity of this universe draws my deepest attention . It is a thing of ultimate beauty.  --  The Stolen JournalsLeto heard Moneo in the antechamber just before Hwi entered the small audience room . She wore voluminous pale green pantaloons tightly tied at the ankles with darker green bows to match her sandals . A loose blouse of the same dark green could be seen under her black cloak . She appeared calm as she approached Leto and sat without being invited , choosing a golden cushion rather than the red one she had occupied earlier . It had taken less than an hour for Moneo to bring her . Leto 's acute hearing detected Moneo fidgeting in the anteroom and Leto sent a signal which sealed the arched doorway there . " Something has disturbed Moneo , " Hwi said . " He tried very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more he tried to soothe me the more he aroused my curiosity . " " He did not frighten you ? " " Oh , no . He did say something very interesting , though . He said that I must remember it at all times , that the God Leto is a different person to each of us . " " How is this interesting ? " Leto asked  | " The interesting thing is the question for which this was the preface . He said he often wonders what part we play in creating that difference in you ? " " That is interesting . " " I think it is a truthful insight , " Hwi said . " Why have you summonedme ? " " At one time , your masters on Ix . . . " " They are no longer my masters , Lord . " " Forgive me . I will refer to them hereafter as the Ixians . " She nodded gravely , prompting : " At one time . . . " " The Ixians contemplated making a weapon  --  a type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . It was to be designedas a self-improving thing which would seek out life and reduce that life to its inorganic matter . " " I have not heard of this thing , Lord . " " I know that . The Ixians do not recognize that machine-makers always run the risk of becoming totally machine . This is ultimate sterility . Machines always fail . . . given time . And when these machinesfailed there would be nothing left , no life at all . " " Sometimes I think they are mad , " she said . " Anteac 's opinion . That is the immediate problem . The Ixians are now engaged in an endeavor which they are concealing . " " Even from you ? " " Even from me . I am sending the Reverend Mother Anteac to investigatefor me . To help her , I want you to tell her everything you can about the place where you spent your childhood . Omit no detail , no matter how small . Anteac will help you remember . We want every sound , every smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even the tinglings of your skin . The slightest thing may be vital . " " You think it is the place of concealment ? " " I know it is . " " And you think they are making this weapon in . . . " " No , but this will be our excuse for investigating the place where you were born . " She opened her mouth and gradually formed a smile , then : " My Lord is devious . I will speak to the Reverend Mother immediately . " Hwi started to rise , but he stopped her with a gesture . " We must not give the appearance of haste , " he said . She sank back onto the cushion . " Each of us is different in the way of Moneo 's observation , " he said . " Genesis does not stop . Your god continues creating you . " " What will Anteac find ? You know , do n't you ? " " Let us say that I have a strong conviction . Now , you have notp228once mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions ? " " You will provide the answers as I require them . " It was a statementfull of such trust that it stopped Leto 's voice . He could only look at her , realizing how extraordinary was this accomplishment of the Ixians  --  this human . Hwi remained precisely true to the dictates of her personally chosen morality . She was comely , warm and honest and possessed of an empathic sense which forced her to share every anguish in those with whom she identified . He could imagine the dismayof her Bene Gesserit teachers when confronted by this immovablecore of self-honesty . The teachers obviously had been reduced to adding a touch here , an ability there , everything strengthening that power which prevented her from becoming a Bene Gesserit . How that must have rankled ! " Lord , " she said , " I would know the motives which forced you to choose your life . " " First , you must understand what it is like to see our future . " " With your help , I will try . " " Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Seeing futuresis a vision of a continuum in which all things take shape like bubbles forming beneath a waterfall . You see them and then they vanish into the stream . If the stream ends , it is as though the bubbles never were . That stream is my Golden Path and I saw it end . " " Your choice  --  " she gestured at his body  --  " changed that ? " " It is changing . The change comes not only from the manner of my life but from the manner of my death . " " You know how you will die ? " " Not how . I know only the Golden Path in which it will occur . " " Lord , I do not ... " " It is difficult to understand , I know . I will die four deaths  --  the death of the flesh , the death of the soul , the death of the myth and the death of reason . And all of these deaths contain the seed of res-urrection . " " You will return from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you are gone , what will happen to your religion ? " " All religions are a single communion . The spectrum remains unbrokenwithin the Golden Path .

"  | " But when forever ends , there will be anger , " she said . " There will be denial . Some will say you were just an ordinary tyrant . " " Delusion , " he agreed . A lump in her throat prevented her from speaking for a moment , then : " How does your life and your death change the . . . " She shook her head . " Life will continue .

I do not think I truly know the shape of your Empire , though . " " Leto 's Golden Peace ? " " There is less peace than some would have us believe , " she said , looking back at him . The honesty of her ! he thought . Nothing deterred it . " This is the time of the stomach , " he said . " This is the time when we expand as a single cell expands . " " But something is missing , " she said . She is like the Duncans , he thought . Something is missing and they sense it immediately . " The flesh grows , but the psyche does not grow , " he said . " The psyche ? " " That reflexive awareness which tells us how very alive we can become . You know it well , Hwi . It is that sense which tells you how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not enough , " she said . " No religion can ever be enough . It is a matter of choice  --  a single , lonely choice . Do you understand now why your friendship and your company mean so much to me ? " She blinked back tears , nodding , then : " Why do n't people know this ? " " Because the conditions do n't permit it . " " The conditions which you dictate ? " " Precisely . Look throughout my Empire . Do you see the shape ? " She closed her eyes , thinking . " One wishes to sit by a river and fish every day ? " he asked . " Excellent . That is this life . You desire to sail a small boat across an inlandsea and visit strangers ? Superb ! What else is there to do ? "  | " Travel in space ? " she asked and there was a defiant note in her voice . She opened her eyes . " You have observed that the Guild and I do not allow this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ True . If the Guild disobeys me , it gets no spice . " " And holding people planetbound keeps them out of mischief . " " It does something more important than that . It fills them with alonging to travel . It creates a need to make far voyages and seestrange things . Eventually , travel comes to mean freedom . " " But the spice dwindles , " she said . " And freedom becomes more precious every day . " " This can only lead to desperation and violence , " she said . " A wise man in my ancestry  --  I was actually that person , youknow ? Do you understand that there are no strangers in my past ? " She nodded , awed . " This wise man observed that wealth is a tool of freedom . But the pursuit of wealth is the way to slavery . " " The Guild and the Sisterhood enslave themselves !

He said : " As the land refuses to support the people , the survivors will crowd into smaller and smaller refuges . A terrible selection processwill be repeated on many worlds  --  explosive birthrates and dwindlingfood . " " But could n't the Guild . . . " " The Guild will be largely helpless without sufficient melange to operate available transports . " " Wo n't the rich escape ? " " Some of them . " " Then you have n't really changed anything .

We will have learned that a thing which can happen on one planet can happen on any planet . "  | " So much pain and death , " she whispered . " Do n't you understand about death ? " he asked . " You must understand . The species must understand . All life must understand . " " Help me , Lord , " she whispered . " It is the most profound experience of any creature , " he said . " Short of death come the things which risk and mirror it  --  life-threateningdiseases , injuries and accidents . . . childbirth for a woman . . . and once it was combat for the males . " " But your Fish Speakers are . . . " " They teach about survival , " he said . Her eyes went wide with understanding . " The survivors . Of course ! " " How precious you are , " he said .

Women know this more often than men because birth is the reflection of death . " " My Uncle Malky always said you had good reasons for denying combat and casual violence to men . What a bitter lesson ! " " Without readily available violence , men have few ways of testing how they will meet that final experience , " he said . " Something is missing . The psyche does not grow .

" Where do you think I find my best administrators ? " he asked . A small gasp escaped her.  | " Principles , " he said , " are what you fight for . Most men gothrough a lifetime unchallenged , except at the final moment . Theyhave so few unfriendly arenas in which to test themselves . " " They have you , " she said . " But I am so powerful , " he said . " I am the equivalent of suicide . Who would seek certain death ? " " Madmen . . . or desperate ones . Rebels ? " " I am their equivalent of war , " he said .

" " They were rebels ? " " Most of them . " " How are they chosen ? " " I could say they choose themselves . " " By surviving ? " " That , too . But there 's more . The difference between a good administratorand a bad one is about five heartbeats . Good administratorsmake immediate choices . " " Acceptable choices ? " " They usually can be made to work . A bad administrator , on the other hand , hesitates , diddles around , asks for committees , for researchand reports . Eventually , he acts in ways which create serious problems . " " But do n't they sometimes need more information to make .. . " " A bad administrator is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard record which he can display as an excusefor his errors . " " And good administrators ? " " Oh , they depend on verbal orders . They never lie about what they 've done if their verbal orders cause problems , and they surround themselves with people able to act wisely on the basis of verbal orders . Often , the most important piece of information is that something has gone wrong . Bad administrators hide their mistakes until it 's too late to make corrections . " Leto watched her as she thought about the people who served him  --  especially about Moneo . " Men of decision , " she said.  | " One of the hardest things for a tyrant to find , " he said , " is people who actually make decisions .

She wrote upon this square with a glittering needle  --  one word upon another , all of them absorbed into the square . The completed message would be impressed upon the nerve receptors of an acolyte-messenger 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chapter House . Hwi Noree posed such a dilemma ! Anteac knew the accounts of Bene Gesserit teachers sent to instructHwi on Ix . But those accounts left out more than they told . They raised greater questions . What adventures have you experienced , child ? What were the hardships of your youth ? Anteac sniffed and glanced down at the waiting square of black . Such thoughts reminded her of the Fremen belief that the land of your birth made you what you were . " Are there strange animals on your planet ? " the Fremen would ask . Hwi had come with an impressive Fish Speaker escort , more than a hundred brawny women , all of them heavily armed . Anteac had seldom seen such a display of weapons  --  lasguns , long knives , sliverblades , stungrenades . . . It had been at midmorning . Hwi had swept in , leaving the Fish Speakers to invest the Bene Gesserit quarters , all except this Spartan inner room . Anteac swept her gaze around her quarters . The Lord Leto was telling her something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure your worth to the God Emperor ! " Except . . . now he sent a Reverend Mother to Ix and the avowed purpose of this journey suggested many things about the Lord Leto . Perhaps times were about to change , new honors and more melange for the Sisterhood . Everything depends upon how well I perform . Hwi had entered this room alone and had sat demurely on Anteac'spallet , her head lower than that of the Reverend Mother 's . A nice touch , and no accident . The Fish Speakers obviously could have placed the two of them anywhere in any relationship Hwi commanded . Hwi 's shocking first words left little doubt of that . " You must know at the outset that I will wed the Lord Leto . " It had required the deep control to keep from gaping . Anteac 's truthsense told her the sincerity of Hwi 's words , but the full portent could not be assessed . " The Lord Leto commands that you say nothing of this to anyone , " Hwi added.  |p236Such  a dilemma ! Anteac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Chapter House ? " Everyone will know in time , " Hwi said . " This is not the time . I tell you because it helps impress upon you the gravity of the Lord Leto 's trust . " " His trust in you ? " " In both of us . " This had sent a barely concealed , shuddering thrill through Anteac . The power inherent in such trust ! " Do you know why Ix chose you as Ambassador ? " Anteac asked . " Yes . They intended me to beguile him . " " You appear to have succeeded . Does this mean that the Ixians believe those Tleilaxu stories about the Lord Leto 's gross habits ? " " Even the Tleilaxu do n't believe them . " " I take it that you confirm the falsehood of such stories ? " Hwi had spoken in an odd flatness which even Anteac 's truthsense and abilities as a Mentat found hard to decipher . " You have talked to him and observed him . Answer that question for yourself . " Anteac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth , this Hwi was not an acolyte . . . and would never make a good Bene Gesserit . Such a pity ! " Have you reported this to your government on Ix ? " Anteac asked . " No . " " Why ? " " They will learn soon enough . Premature revelation could harm the Lord Leto . " She is truthful , Anteac reminded herself . " Is n't your first loyalty to Ix ? " Anteac asked . " Truth is my first loyalty . " She smiled then . " Ix contrived better than it thought . " " Does Ix think of you as a threat to the God Emperor ? " " I think their primary concern is knowledge . I discussed this with Ampre before leaving . " " The Director of Ix 's Outfederation Affairs ? That Arnpre ? " " Yes . Ampre is convinced that the Lord Leto permits threats to his person only up to certain limits . " " Ampre said that ? " " Ampre does not believe the future can be hidden from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has about it the suggestion that . . . " An/teac broke off and shook her head , then : " Why does Ix provide the Lord with machines and weapons ? " " Ampre believes that Ix has no choice . Overwhelming force destroyspeople who pose too great a threat . " " And if Ix refused , that would pass the Lord Leto 's limits . No middle point . Have you thought about the consequences of wedding the Lord Leto ? " " You mean the doubts such an act will raise about his godhead ? " " Some will believe the Tleilaxu stories . " Hwi only smiled . Damnation ! Anteac thought . How did we lose this girl ? " He is changing the design of his religion , " Anteac accused . " That 's it , of course . " " Do not make the mistake of judging all others by yourselves , " Hwi said . And , as Anteac started to bridle , Hwi added : " But I did not come here to argue with you about the Lord . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Lord Leto has commanded me , " Hwi said , " to tell you every detail in my memory about the place where I was born and raised . " As she reflected on Hwi 's words , Anteac stared down at the crypticsquare of black in her lap . Hwi had proceeded to recount the detailswhich her Lord ( and now bridegroom ! ) had commanded , detailswhich would have been boring at times were it not for Anteac 's Mentat abilities at data absorption . Anteac shook her head as she considered what must be reported to her Sisters at the Chapter House . They already would be studying the import of her previous message . A machine which could shield itself and contents from the penetrating prescience of even the God Emperor ? Was that possible ? Or was this a different kind of test , a test of Bene Gesserit candor with their Lord Leto ? But now ! If he did not already know the genesis of this enigmatic Hwi Noree . . . This new development reinforced Anteac 's Mentat summation of why she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God Emperor did not trust this knowledge to his Fish Speakers . He did not want Fish Speakers suspecting a weakness in their Lord ! Or was that as obvious as it appeared ? Wheels within wheels  --  that was the way of the Lord Leto . Again , Anteac shook her head . She bent then and resumed her account for the Chapter House , leaving out the revelation that the God Emperor had chosen a bride . They would learn it soon enough . Meanwhile , Anteac herself would consider the implications.  |p238If  you know all of your ancestors , you were a personal witness to the events which created the myths and religions of our past . Recognizing this , you must think of me as a myth-maker.  --  The Stolen JournalsThe first explosion came just as darkness enfolded the City of Onn . The blast caught a few venturesome revelers outside the Ixian Embassy , passing on their way to a party where ( it was promised ) Face Dancers would perform an ancient drama about a king who slew his children . After the violent events of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage for the revelers to emerge from the relative safety of their quarters . Stories of death and injury to innocentbystanders circulated all through the City  --  and here it was again  --  more fuel for the cautious . None of the victims and survivors would have appreciated Leto 's observation that innocent bystanders were in relatively short supply . Leto 's acute senses detected the explosion and located it . With an instant fury which he was later to regret , he shouted for his Fish Speakers and commanded them to " wipe out the Face Dancers , " even the ones he had spared earlier . On immediate reflection , the sensation of fury itself fascinatedp239Leto . It had been so long since he had felt even mild anger . Frustration , irritation  --  these had been his limits . But now , at a threat to Hwi Noree , fury ! Reflection caused him to modify his initial command , but not beforesome Fish Speakers had raced from the Royal Presence , their most violent desires released by what they had seen in their Lord . " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second blast caught some of the Fish Speakers emerging into the plaza , limiting the spread of Leto 's modified command and ignitingmore violence . The third explosion , located near the first one , sent Leto himself into action . He propelled his cart like a berserk juggernaut out of his resting chamber into the Ixian lift and surged to the surface . Leto emerged at the edge of the plaza to find a scene of chaos lighted by thousands of free-floating glowglobes released by his Fish Speakers . The central stage of the plaza had been shattered , leaving only the plasteel base intact beneath the paved surface , Broken pieces of masonry lay all around , mixed with dead and wounded . In the direction of the Ixian Embassy , directly across the plaza from him , there was a wild surging of combat . " Where is my Duncan ? " Leto bellowed . A guard bashar came racing across the plaza to his side where she reported through panting breaths : " We have taken him to the Citadel , Lord ! " " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle outside the Ixian Embassy . " The rebels and the Tleilaxu are attacking the Ixian Embassy , Lord . They have explosives . " Even as she spoke , another blast erupted in front of the Embassy 's shattered facade . He saw bodies twisting in the air , arching outward and falling at the perimeter of a bright flash which left an orange afterimage , studded with black dots . With no thought of consequences , Leto shifted his cart onto suspensorsand sent it bulleting across the plaza  --  a hurtling behemoth which sucked glowglobes into its wake . At the battle 's edge , he arched over his own defenders and plunged into the attackers ' flank , aware only then of lasguns which sent livid blue arcs leaping toward him . He felt his cart thudding into flesh , scattering bodies all around . The cart spilled him directly in front of the Embassy , rolling him off onto a hard surface as it struck the rubble there . He felt lasgun beams tickle his ribbed body , then the inner surge of heat followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucked his face deep into its cowl and folded his arms into the protective depths of hisp240front segment . The worm-body took over , arching and flailing , rollinglike an insane wheel , lashing out on all sides . Blood lubricated the street . Blood was buffered water to his body , but death released the water . His flailing body slipped and slithered in it , the water igniting blue smoke from every flexion place where it slipped through the sandtrout skin . This filled him with water-agony which ignited more violence in the great flailing body . At Leto 's first lashing out , the Fish Speaker perimeter fell back . An alert bashar saw the opportunity now presented . She shouted above the battle noise : " Pick off the stragglers ! " The ranks of guardian women rushed forward . It was bloody play among the Fish Speakers for a few minutes , blades thrusting in the merciless light of the glowglobes , the dancing of lasgun arcs , even hands chopping and toes digging into vulnerable flesh . The Fish Speakers left no survivors . Leto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , barely able to think through the waves of water-agony . The air was heavy with oxygen all around him and this helped his human senses . He summoned his cart and it drifted toward him , tipping perilously on damaged suspensors . Slowly , he wriggled onto the tipping cart and gave it the mental command to return to his quarters beneath the plaza . Long ago , he had prepared himself against water-damage  --  a room where blasts of superheated dry air would cleanse and restore him . Sand would serve but there was no place in the confines of Onn for the necessary expanse of sand in which he might heat and rasp his surface to its normal purity . In the lift , he thought of Hwi and sent a message to have her brought down to him immediately . If she survived . He had no time now to make a prescient search ; he could only hope while his body , both pre-worm and human , longed for the cleansing heat . Once into the cleansing room , he thought to reaffirm his modified command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But by then the maddenedFish Speakers were spreading out through the City and he had not the strength to make a prescient sweep which would send his messengers to the proper meeting points . A Guard captain brought him word as he was emerging from the cleansing room that Hwi Noree , although slightly wounded , was safe and would be brought to him as soon as the local commander thought it prudent.  |p241Leto  promoted the Guard captain to sub-bashar on the spot . She was a heavyset Nayla-type but without Nayla 's square face  --  features more rounded and closer to the older norms . She trembled in the warmth of her Lord 's approval and , when he told her to return and " make doubly certain " no more harm came to Hwi , she whirled and dashed from his presence . I did n't even ask her name , Leto thought , as he rolled himself onto a new cart in the depression of his small audience room . It took a few moments of reflection to recall the new sub-bashar 's name  --  Kieuemo . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental reminder to do this personally . The Fish Speakers , all of them , would have to learn immediately how much he valued Hwi Noree . Not that there could be much doubt after tonight . He made his prescient scan then and dispatched messengers to his rampaging Fish Speakers . By then the damage had been done  --  corpses all over Onn , some Face Dancers and some only-suspected Face Dancers . And many have seen me kill , he thought . While he waited for Hwi 's arrival , he reviewed what had just happened . This had not been a typical Tleilaxu attack , but the previous attack on the road to Onn fitted into a new pattern , all of it pointing at a single mind with lethal purpose . I could have died out there , he thought . That began to explain why he had not anticipated this attack , but there was a deeper reason . Leto could see that reason rising into his awareness , a summation of all the clues . What human knew the God Emperor best ? What human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Leto summoned a guard and told her to ask if the Reverend Mother Anteac had yet left Arrakis . The guard returned in a moment to report . " Anteac is still in her quarters . The Commander of the Fish Speaker Guard there says they have not come under attack . " " Send word to Anteac , " Leto said . " Ask if she now understands why I put her delegation in quarters at a distance from me ? Then tell her that while she is on Ix she must locate Malky . She is to report that location to our local garrison on Ix . " " Malky , the former Ixian Ambassador ? " " The same . He is not to remain alive and free . You will inform our garrison commander on Ix that she is to make close liaison with Anteac , providing every necessary assistance . Malky is to be brought here to me or executed , whichever our commander finds necessary . "  |p242The  guard-messenger nodded , shadows lurching across her featureswhere she stood in the ring of light around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repetition of the orders . Each of his close guards had been trained as a human-recorder . They could repeat Leto 's words exactly , even the intonations , and would never forget what they had heard him say . When the messenger had gone , Leto sent a private signal of inquiryand , within seconds , had a response from Nayla . The Ixian devicewithin his cart reproduced a nonidentifiable version of her voice , a flatly metallic recital for his ears alone . Yes , Siona was at the Citadel . No , Siona had not contacted her rebel companions . " No , she does not yet know that I am here observingher . " The attack on the Embassy ? That had been by a splintergroup called " The Tleilaxu-Contact Element . " Leto allowed himself a mental sigh . Rebels always gave their groups such pretentious labels . " Any survivors ? " he asked . " No known survivors . " Leto found it amusing that , while the metallic voice provided no emotional tones , his memory supplied them . " You will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are a Fish Speaker . Tell her you did not reveal this earlier because you knew she would not trust you and because you feared exposure since you are quite alone among Fish Speakers in your allegiance to Siona . Reaffirm your oath to her . Tell her that you swear by all that you hold holy to obey Siona in anything . If she commands it , you will do it . All of this is truth , as you well know . " " Yes , Lord . " Memory supplied the fanatic emphasis in Nayla 's response . She would obey . " If possible , provide opportunities for Siona and Duncan Idaho to be alone together , " he said . " Yes , Lord . " Let propinquity take its usual course , he thought . He broke contact with Nayla , thought for a moment , then sent for the commander of his plaza forces . The bashar arrived presently , her dark uniform stained and dusty , evidence of gore still on her boots . She was a tall , bone-thin woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful dignity . Leto recalled her troopname , lylyo , which meant " Dependable " in Old Fremen . He called her , however , by her matronymic , Nyshae , " Daughter of Shae , " which set a tone of subtle intimacy for this meeting.  | " Rest yourself on a cushion , Nyshae , " he said . " You have been working hard . " " Thank you , Lord . " She sank onto the red cushion which Hwi had used . Leto noted the fatigue lines around Nyshae 's mouth , but her eyes remained alert . She stared up at him , eager to hear his words . " Matters are once more tranquil in my City . " He made it not quite a question , leaving the interpretation to Nyshae . " Tranquil but not good , Lord . " He glanced at the gore on her boots . " The street in front of the Ixian Embassy ? " " It is being cleansed , Lord . Repairs already are under way . " " The plaza ? " " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her gaze remained steady on his face . Both of them knew he had not yet reached the nubbin of this interview . But Leto now identified a thing lurking within Nyshae 's expression . Pride in her Lord ! For the first time , she had seen the God Emperor kill . The seeds of a terrible dependency had been planted . If disaster threatens , my Lord will come . That was how it appeared in her eyes . She would no longer act with complete independence , taking her power from the God Emperor and being personally responsible for the use of that power . There was something possessive in her expression . A terrible death-machine waited in the wings , available at her summons . Leto did not like what he saw , but the damage had been done . Any remedies would require slow and subtle pressures . " Where did the attackers get lasguns ? " he asked . " From our own stores , Lord . The Arsenal Guard has been re-placed . " Replaced . It was a euphemism with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Leto found a problem which required Death Commandos . They would die gladly , of course , believing that thus they expiated their sin . And even the rumor that such berserkers had been dispatched could quiet a trouble spot . " The arsenal was breached by explosives ? " he asked . " Stealth and explosives , Lord . The Arsenal Guard was careless . " " The source of the explosives ? " Some of Nyshae 's fatigue was visible in her shrug . Leto could only agree . He knew he could search out and identify those sources , but it would serve little purpose . Resourceful people could always find the ingredients for homemade explosives  --  commonp244things such as sugar and bleaches , quite ordinary oils and innocent fertilizers , plastics and solvents and extracts from the dirt beneath a manure pile . The list was virtually endless , growing with each addition to human experience and knowledge . Even a society such as the one he had created , one which tried to limit the admixture of technologyand new ideas , had no real hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlling such things was chimera , a dangerous and distracting myth . The key was to limit the desire for violence . In that respect , this night had been a disaster . So much new injustice , he thought . As though she read his thought , Nyshae sighed . Of course . Fish Speakers were trained from childhood to avoid injusticewherever possible . " We must see to the survivors in the populace , " he said . " See to it that their needs are met . They must be brought to the realization that the Tleilaxu were to blame . " Nyshae nodded . She had not reached bashar rank while remaining ignorant of the drill . By now , she believed it . Merely by hearing Leto say it , she believed in the Tleilaxu guilt . And there was a certain practicality in her understanding . She knew why they did not slay all of the Tleilaxu . You do not eliminate every scapegoat . " And we must provide a distraction , " Leto said . " Luckily , there may be one ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferring with the Lady Hwi Noree . " " The Ixian Ambassador , Lord ? Is she not implicated in . . . " " She is entirely guiltless , " he said . He saw belief settle into Nyshae 's features , a readymade plastic underlayment which could lock her jaw and glaze her eyes . Even Nyshae . He knew the reasons because he had created those reasons , but sometimes he felt a bit awed by his creation . " I hear the Lady Hwi arriving in my anteroom , " he said . " Send her in as you leave . And , Nyshae . . . " She already was on her feet , but she stood expectantly silent . " Tonight , I have elevated Kieuemo to sub-bashar , " he said . " See that it is made official . As for yourself , I am pleased . Ask and you shall receive . " He saw the formula send a wave of pleasure through Nyshae , but she tempered it immediately , proving once more her worth to him . " I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If she suits , I may take a holiday . I have not seen my family on Salusa Secundus for many years . "  | " At a time of your own choosing , " he said . And he thought : Salusa Secundus . Of course ! That one reference to her origins reminded him of who she resembled : Harq al-Ada . She has Corrino blood . We are closer relatives than I had thought . " My Lord is generous , " she said . She left him then , a new spring in her stride . He heard her voice in the anteroom : " Lady Hwi , our Lord will see you now . " Hwi entered , backlighted and framed in the archway for a moment , hesitancy in her step until her eyes adjusted to the inner chamber . She came like a moth to the brightness around Leto 's face , looking away only to seek along his shadowy length for signs of injury . He knew that no such sign was visible , but there were still aches and interior tremblings . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg , but a long gown of jade green concealed the injury . She stopped at the edge of the declevity which held his cart , looking directly into his eyes . " They said you were wounded , Hwi . Are you in pain ? " " A cut on my leg below the knee , Lord . A small piece of masonry from the explosion . Your Fish Speakers treated it with a salve which removed the pain . Lord , I feared for you . " " And I feared for you , gentle Hwi . " " Except for that first explosion , I was not in danger , Lord . They rushed me into a room deep beneath the Embassy . " So she did not see my performance , he thought . I can be thankful for that . " I sent for you to ask your forgiveness , " he said . She sank onto a golden cushion . " What is there to forgive , Lord ? You are not the reason for ... " " I am being tested , Hwi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to know the depths of my concern for the safety of Hwi Noree . " She pointed upward . " That . . . was because of me ? " " Because of us . " " Oh . But who . . . " " You have agreed to wed me , Hwi , and I . . . " He raised a hand to silence her as she started to speak . " Anteac has told us what you revealed to her , but this did not originate with Anteac . " " Then who is . . . " " The who is not important . It is important that you reconsider . I must give you this opportunity to change your mind . "  |p246She  lowered her gaze . How sweet her features are , he thought . It was possible for him to create only in his imagination an entire human lifetime with Hwi . Enough examples lay in the welter of his memories upon which to build a fantasy of wedded life . It gathered nuances in his fancy  --  small details of mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sweet sharings upon which arose something of painful beauty . He ached with it , a pain far deeper than the physical remindersof his violence at the Embassy . Hwi lifted her chin and looked into his eyes . He saw there a compassionatelonging to help him . " But how else may I serve you , Lord ? " He reminded himself that she was a primate , while he no longer was fully primate . The differences grew deeper by the minute . The ache remained within him . Hwi was an inescapable reality , something so basic that no word could ever fully express it . The ache within him was almost more than he could bear . " I love you , Hwi . I love you as a man loves a woman . . . but it can not be . That will never be . " Tears flowed from her eyes . " Should I leave ? Should I return to Ix ? " " They would only hurt you , trying to find out what went wrong with their plan . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the futility and frustration . What will she do ? She will not lie . She will not say she returnsmy love as a woman to a man . She recognizes the futility . And she knows her own feelings for me  --  compassion , awe , a questioning which ignores fear . " Then I will stay , " she said . " We will take such pleasure as we can from being together . I think it is best that we do this . If it means we should wed , so be it . " " Then I must share knowledge with you which I have shared with no other person , " he said . " It will give you a power over me which . . . " " Do not do this , Lord ! What if someone forced me to . . . " " You will never again leave my household . My quarters here , theCitadel , the safe places of the Sareer  --  these will be your home . " " As you will . " How gentle and open her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him had to be calmed . In itself , it was a danger to him and to the Golden Path . Those clever Ixians !  |p247Malky  had seen how the all-powerful were forced to contend with a constant siren song  --  the will to self-delight . Constant awareness of the power in your slightest whim . Hwi took his silence to be uncertainty . " Will we wed , Lord ? " " Yes . " " Should anything be done about the Tleilaxu stories which .. . " " Nothing . " She stared at him , remembering their earlier conversation . The seeds of dissolution were being planted . " It is my fear , Lord , that I will weaken you , " she said . " Then you must find ways to strengthen me . " " Can it strengthen you if we diminish belief in the God Leto ? " He heard a hint of Malky in her voice , that measured weighing which had made him so revoltingly charming . We never completely escape the teachers of our childhood . " Your question begs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worship according to my design . Others will believe the lies . " " Lord . . . would you ask me to lie for you ? " " Of course not . But I will ask you to remain silent when you might wish to speak . " " But if they revile . . . " " You will not protest . " Once more , tears flowed down her cheeks . Leto longed to touch them , but they were water . . . painful water . " It must be done this way , " he said . " Will you explain it to me , Lord ? " " When I am gone , they must call me Shaitan , the Emperor of Gehenna . The wheel must turn and turn and turn along the Golden Path . " " Lord , could the anger not be directed at me alone ? I would not . . . " " No ! The Ixians made you much more perfectly than they thought . I truly love you . I can not help it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The words were wrenched from her . " What 's done is done . Do not mourn it . " " Help me to understand . " " The hate which will blossom after I am gone , that , too , will fade into the inevitable past . A long time will pass . Then , on a far-distant day , my journals will be found . " " Journals ? " She was shaken by the seeming shift of subject . " My chronicle of my time . My arguments , the apologia . Copies exist and scattered fragments will survive , some in distorted form ,  |p248but  the original journals will wait and wait and wait . I have hidden them well . " " And when they are discovered ? " " People will learn that I was something quite different from what they supposed . " Her voice came in a trembling hush . " I already know what they will learn . " " Yes , my darling Hwi , I think you do . " " You are neither devil nor god , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again because your presence removes the need . " She brushed tears from her cheeks . " Hwi , do you realize how dangerous you are ? " Alarm showed in her expression , the tensing of her arms . " You have the makings of a saint , " he said . " Do you understand how painful it can be to find a saint in the wrong place and the wrong time ? " She shook her head . " People have to be prepared for saints , " he said . " Otherwise , they simply become followers , supplicants , beggars and weakened sycophantsforever in the shadow of the saint . People are destroyed by this because it nurtures only weakness . " After a moment of thought , she nodded , then : " Will there be saints when you are gone ? " " That 's the purpose of my Golden Path . " " Moneo 's daughter , Siona , will she . . . " " For now she is only a rebel . As to sainthood , we will let her decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . " " What is that , Lord ? " " Stop calling me Lord , " he said . " We will be Worm and wife . Call me Leto if you wish . Lord interferes . " " Yes , L . . . Leto . But what is . . . " " Siona was bred to rule . There is danger in such breeding . When you rule , you gain knowledge of power . This can lead into impetuous irresponsibility , into painful excesses and that can lead to the terrible destroyer  --  wild hedonism . " " Siona would . . . " " All we know about Siona is that she can remain dedicated to a particular performance , to the pattern which fills her senses . She is necessarily an aristocrat , but aristocracy looks mostly to the past . That 's a failure . You do n't see much of any path unless you are Janus , looking simultaneously backward and forward . " " Janus ? Oh , yes , the god with the two opposed faces . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you Janus , Leto ? "  | " I am Janus magnified a billionfold . And I am also something less . I have been , for example , what my administrators admire most  --  the decision-maker whose every decision can be made to work . " " But if you fail them . . . " " They will turn against me , yes . " " Will Siona replace you if . . . " " Ahhh , what an enormous if ! You observe that Siona threatens my person . However , she does not threaten the Golden Path . There is also the fact that my Fish Speakers have a certain attachment to the Duncan . " " Siona seems . . . so young . " " And I am her favorite poseur , the sham who holds power under false pretenses , never consulting the needs of his people . " " Could I not talk to her and . . . " " No ! You must never try to persuade Siona of anything . Promise me , Hwi . " " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " All gods have this problem , Hwi . In the perception of deeper needs , I must often ignore immediate ones . Not addressing immediateneeds is an offense to the young . " " Could you not reason with her and . . . " " Never attempt to reason with people who know they are right ! " " But when you know they are wrong . . . " " Do you believe in me ? " " Yes . " " And if someone tried to convince you that I am the greatest evil of all time . . . " " I would become very angry . I would . . . " She broke off . " Reason is valuable , " he said , " only when it performs against the wordless physical background of the universe . " Her brows drew together in thought . It fascinated Leto to sense the arousal of her awareness . " Ahhhh . " She breathed the word . " No reasoning creature will ever again be able to deny the Leto experience , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beginnings ! They are what life is all about ! " She nodded . No arguments , he thought . When she sees the tracks , she follows them to find where they will lead . " As long as there is life , every ending is a beginning , " he said . " And I would save humankind , even from itself . " Again , she nodded . The tracks still led onward . " This is why no death in the perpetuation of humankind can be ap250complete failure , " he said . " This is why a birth touches us so deeply . This is why the most tragic death is the death of a youth . " " Does Ix still threaten your Golden Path ? I 've always known they conspired in something evil . " They conspire .

" It will be a performance of the surviving Face Dancers . Afterward , our betrothal will be announced .

This is the favrashi of which I speak , the soul , the collective unconscious , the source of archetypes , the repository of all trauma and joy . I am the choice of their awakening . My samhadi is their samhadi . Their experiences are mine ! Their knowledge distilledis my inheritance . Those billions are my one.  --  The Stolen JournalsThe Face Dancer performance occupied almost two hours of the morning , and afterward came the announcement which sent shock waves through the Festival City . " It has been centuries since he took a bride ! " " More than a thousand years , my dear . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheered him loudly , but they were disturbed . " You are my only brides , " he had said . Was that not the meaning of Siaynoq ? Leto thought the Face Dancers performed well despite their obviousterror . Garments had been found in the depths of a Fremen museum  --  hooded black robes with white cord belts , spread-wingedp252green hawks appliqued across the shoulders at the back  --  uniforms of Muad'Dib 's itinerant priests . The Face Dancers had put on dark , seamed faces with these robes and performed a dance which told how Muad'Dib 's legions had spread their religion through the Empire . Hwi , wearing a brilliant silver dress with a green jade necklace , sat beside Leto on the Royal Cart throughout the ritual . Once , she leaned close to his face and asked : " Is that not a parody ? " " To me , perhaps . " " Do the Face Dancers know ? " " They suspect . " " Then they are not as frightened as they appear . " " Oh , yes , they are frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people expect them to be . " " Bravery can be so foolish , " she whispered . " And vice-versa . " She had favored him with a measuring stare before returning her attention to the performance . Almost two hundred Face Dancers had survived unscathed . All of them had been pressed into the dance . The intricate weavings and posturings could fascinate the eye . It was possible to watch them and , for a time , forget the bloody preliminariesto this day . Leto remembered this as he lay alone in his small reception room shortly before noon when Moneo arrived . Moneo had seen the ReverendMother Anteac onto a Guild lighter , had conferred with the Fish Speaker Command about the previous night 's violence , had made a quick flight to the Citadel and back to make sure Siona was under a secure watch and that she had not been implicated in the Embassy attack . He had returned to Onn just after the betrothal announcement , having had no previous warning . Moneo was furious . Leto had never seen him this angry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Leto 's face . " Now the Tleilaxu lies will be believed ! " he said . Leto responded in a reasoned tone . " How persistent it is , this demand that our gods be perfect . The Greeks were much more reasonableabout such things . " " Where is she ? " Moneo demanded . " Where is this . . . " " Hwi is resting . It was a difficult night and a long morning . I wanther well rested when we return to the Citadel this evening . " " How did she work this ? " Moneo demanded . " Really , Moneo ! Have you lost all sense of caution ? " " I am concerned about you ! Have you any idea what they 're saying in the City ? "  | " I 'm fully aware of the stories . " " What are you doing ? " " You know , Moneo , I think that only the old pantheists had the right idea about deities : mortal foibles in immortal guise . " Moneo raised both arms to the heavens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He lowered his arms . " It 'll be all over the Empire within two weeks . " " Surely it 'll take longer than that . " " If your enemies needed one thing to bring them all together . . . " " The defiling of the god is an ancient human tradition , Moneo . Why should I be an exception ? " Moneo tried to speak , found he could not utter a word . He stamped down along the edge of the pit which held Leto 's cart , stamped back and resumed his former position glaring into Leto 's face . " If I am to help you , I need an explanation , " Moneo said . " Why are you doing this ? " " Emotions . " Moneo 's mouth formed the word without speaking it . " They have come over me just when I thought them gone forever , " Leto said . " How sweet these last few sips of humanity are . " " With Hwi ? But you surely can not . . . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you telling me that you are indulging yourself in a . . . " " Indulgence ? Certainly not ! But the tripod upon which Eternityswings is composed of flesh and thought and emotion . I felt that Ihad been reduced to flesh and thought . " " She has worked some kind of witchery , " Moneo accused . " Of course she has . And how grateful I am for it . If we deny the need for thought , Moneo , as some do , we lose the powers of reflection ; we can not define what our senses report . If we deny the flesh , we unwheel the vehicle which bears us . But if we deny emotion , we lose all touch with our internal universe . It was emotions which I missed the most . " " I insist , Lord , that you . . . " " You are making me angry , Moneo . That is an emotion . " Leto saw Moneo 's frustrated fury cool , quenched like a hot ironplunged into icy water . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care not for myself , Lord . My concern is mostly for you , andyou know this . " Leto spoke softly . " It is your emotion , Moneo , and I hold it dear . " Moneo inhaled a deep , trembling breath . He had never before seenp254the God Emperor in this mood , reflecting this emotion . Leto appearedboth elated and resigned , if Moneo were reading it correctly . One could not be certain . " That which makes life sweet for the living , " Leto said , " that which makes life warm and filled with beauty , that is what I would preserve even though it were denied to me . " " Then this Hwi Noree . . . " " She makes me recall the Butlerian Jihad in a poignant way . She is the antithesis of all that 's mechanical and non-human . How odd it is , Moneo , that the Ixians , of all people , should produce this one person who so perfectly embodies those qualities which I hold most dear . " " I do not understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that think have no place in . . . " " The target of the Jihad was a machine-attitude as much as the machines , " Leto said . " Humans had set those machines to usurp our sense of beauty , our necessary selfdom out of which we make living judgments . Naturally , the machines were destroyed . " " Lord , I still resent the fact that you welcome this . . . " " Moneo ! Hwi reassures me merely by her presence . For the first time in centuries , I am not lonely unless she is away from my side . If I had no other proof of the emotion , this would serve . " Moneo fell silent , obviously touched by Leto 's evocation of loneliness . Surely , Moneo could understand the absence of the intimate sharing in love . His expression betrayed as much . For the first time in a long while , Leto noted how much Moneo had aged . It happens so suddenly to them , Leto thought . It made Leto deeply aware of how much he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , but I can not help it . . . especially now that Hwi is here . " They will laugh at you and make obscene jests , " Moneo said . " That is a good thing . " " How can it be good ? " " This is something new . Our task has always been to bring the new into balance and , with it , modify behavior while not suppressing survival . " " Even so , how can you welcome this ? " " The making of obscenities ? " Leto asked . " What is the opposite of obscenity ? " Moneo 's eyes went wide with a sudden questioning awareness . He had seen the action of many polarities  --  the thing made known by its opposite.  |p255The  thing stands out against a background which defines it , Leto thought . Surely Moneo will see this . " It 's too dangerous , " Moneo said . The ultimate verdict of conservatism ! Moneo was not convinced . A deep sigh wracked him . I must remember not to take away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed my Fish Speakers in the plaza . The Ixians are holding on to the ragged end of human doubts . Hwi is the evidence of that . A disturbance sounded in the anteroom . Leto sealed the portal against impetuous intrusions . " My Duncan has come , " he said . " He 's probably heard about your wedding plans  --  " " Probably . " Leto watched Moneo wrestle with doubts , his thoughts utterly transparent . In that moment , Moneo fit so precisely into his human niche that Leto wanted to hug him . He has the full spectrum : doubt-to-trust , love-to-hate . . . everything ! All of those dear qualities which come to fruition in the warmth of emotion , in the willingness to spend yourself on Life . " Why is Hwi accepting this ? " Moneo asked . Leto smiled . Moneo can not doubt me ; he must doubt others . " I admit it is not a conventional union . She is a primate and I no longer am fully primate . " Again , Moneo wrestled with things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Leto felt the flow of an observational-awareness , a thought process which occurred so rarely but with such vivid amplificationwhen it did occur , that Leto did not stir lest he cause a ripple in the flow . The primate thinks and , by thinking , survives . Beneath his thinkingis a thing which came with his cells . It is the current of human concerns for the species . Sometimes , they cover it up , wall it o ff and hide it behind thick barriers , but I have deliberately sensitized Moneo to these workings of his innermost self . He follows me because he believes I hold the best course for human survival . He knows there is a cellular awareness . It is what I find when I scan the Golden Path . This is humanity and both of us agree : it must endure ! " Where , when and how will the wedding ceremony be conducted ? " Moneo asked . Not why ? Leto noted . Moneo no longer sought to understand the why . He had returned to safe ground . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the First Minister.  |p256He  has names and verbs and modifiers with which he can perform . The words will work for him in their usual ways . Moneo may never glimpse the transcendental potential of his words , but he well understandstheir everyday , mundane uses . " What of my question ? " Moneo pressed . Leto blinked at him , thinking : I , on the other hand , feel that words are mostly useful if they open for me a glimpse of attractive and undiscovered places . But the use of words is so little understood by a civilization which still believes unquestioningly in a mechanical universe of absolute cause and effect  --  obviously reducible to one singleroot-cause and one primary seminal-effect . " How like a limpet the Ixian-Tleilaxu fallacy clings to human affairs , " Leto said . " Lord , it disturbs me deeply when you do n't pay attention . " " But I do pay attention , Moneo . " " Not to me . " " Even to you . " " Your attention wanders , Lord . You do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself before I would betray you . " " You think I 'm woolgathering ? " " Whatgathering , Lord ? " Moneo had never questioned this word earlier , but now .. . Leto explained the allusion , thinking : How ancient ! The looms and shuttles clicked in Leto 's memory . Animal fur to human garments ... huntsman to herdsman . . . the long steps up the ladder of awareness . . . and now they must make another long step , longer even than the ancient ones . " You indulge in idle thoughts , " Moneo accused . " I have time for idle thoughts . That 's one of the most interesting things about my existence as a singular multitude . " " But , Lord , there are matters which demand our . . . " " You 'd be surprised what comes of idle thinking , Moneo . I 've never minded spending an entire day on things a human would not bother with for one minute . Why not ? With my life expectancy of some four thousand years , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does one human life count ? A million minutes ? I 've already experiencedalmost that many days . " Moneo stood frozen in silence , diminished by this comparison . He felt his own lifetime reduced to a mote in Leto 's eye . The source of the allusion did not escape him . Words . . . words . . . words , Moneo thought . " Words are often almost useless in sentient affairs , " Leto said.  |p257Moneo  held his breathing to a shallow minimum . The Lord can read thoughts ! " Throughout our history , " Leto said , " the most potent use of words has been to round out some transcendental event , giving that event a place in the accepted chronicles , explaining the event in such a way that ever afterward we can use those words and say : " This is what it meant . " Moneo felt beaten down by these words , terrified by unspoken things they might make him think . " That 's how events get lost in history , " Leto said . After a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my question , Lord . The wedding ? " How tired he sounds , Leto thought . How utterly defeated . Leto spoke briskly : " I have never needed your good offices more . The wedding must be managed with utmost care . It must have theprecision of which only you are capable . " " Where , Lord ? " A bit more life in his voice . " At Tabur Village in the Sareer . " " When ? " " I leave the date to you . Announce it when all things are ar-ranged . " " And the ceremony itself ? " " I will conduct it . " " Will you need assistants , Lord ? Artifacts of any kind ? " " The trappings of ritual ? " " Any particular thing which I may not . . . " " We will not need much for our little charade . " " Lord ! I beg of you ! Please . . . " " You will stand beside the bride and give her in marriage , " Leto said . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need water rings then , " Moneo said . " Yes ! I will use Ghani 's water rings . " " And who will attend , Lord ? " " Only a Fish Speaker guard and the aristocracy . " Moneo stared at Leto 's face . " What . . . what does my Lord mean by aristocracy ' ? " " You , your family , the household entourage , the courtiers of the Citadel . " " My fam . . . " Moneo swallowed . " Do you include Siona ? " " If she survives the test . " " But . . . " " Is she not family ? "  | " Of course , Lord . She is Atreides and . . . " " Then by all means include Siona ! " Moneo brought a tiny memocorder from his pocket , a dull black Ixian artifact whose existence crowded the proscriptions of the ButlerianJihad . A soft smile touched Leto 's lips . Moneo knew his duties and would now perform them . The clamor of Duncan Idaho outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moneo knows the price of his privileges , Leto thought . It is another kind of marriage  --  the marriage of privilege and duty . It is the aristocrat 's explanation and his excuse . Moneo finished his note taking . " A few details , Lord , " Moneo said . " Will there be some special garb for Hwi ? " " The stillsuit and robe of a Fremen bride , real ones . " " Jewelry or other baubles ? " Leto 's gaze locked on Moneo 's fingers scrabbling over the tiny recorder , seeing there a dissolution . Leadership , courage , a sense of knowledge and order  --  Moneo has these in abundance . They surround him like a holy aura , but they conceal from all eyes except mine the rot which eats from within . It is inevitable . Were I gone , it would be visible to everyone . " Lord ? " Moneo pressed . " Are you woolgathering ? " Ahhh ! He likes that word ! " That is all , " Leto said . " Only the robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowed and turned away . He is looking ahead now , Leto thought , but even this new thing will pass . He will turn toward the past once more . And I had such high hopes for him once . Well . . . perhaps Siona . . .  | " Make no heroes , " my father said.  --  The voice of Ghanima , From the Oral HistoryJust by the way Idaho strode across the small chamber , his loud demands for audience now gratified , Leto could see an important transformation in the ghola . It was a thing repeated so many times that it had become deeply familiar to Leto . The Duncan had not even exchanged words of greeting with the departing Moneo . It all fitted into the pattern . How boring that pattern had become ! Leto had a name for this transformation of the Duncans . He called it " The Since Syndrome . " The gholas often nurtured suspicions about the secret things which might have been developed across the centuries of oblivion since they last knew awareness . What had people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want me , this relic from their past ? No ego could overcome such doubts forever  --  especially in a doubting man . One of the gholas had accused Leto : " You 've put things in my body , things I know nothing about ! These things in my body tell you everything I 'm doing ! You spy on me everywhere ! " Another had charged him with possessing a " manipulative machinewhich makes us want to do whatever you want . "  |p260Once  it started , the Since Syndrome could never be entirely eliminated . It could be checked , even diverted , but the dormant seed might sprout at the slightest provocation . Idaho stopped where Moneo had stood and there was a veiled look of nonspecific suspicions in his eyes , in the set of his shoulders . Leto allowed the situation to simmer , bringing the condition to a head . Idaho locked gazes with him , then broke away to dart his glances around the room . Leto recognized the manner behind that gaze . The Duncans never forget ! As he studied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries before by the Lady Jessica and the Mentat Thufir Hawat , Idaho began to feel a giddy sense of dislocation . He thought the room rejected him , each thing  --  the soft cushions : big bulbous things in gold , green and a red that was almost purple ; the Fremen rugs , each a museum piece , lapping over each other in thick piles around Leto 's pit ; the false sunlight of Ixian glowglobes , light which envelopedthe Emperor 's face in dry warmth , making the shadows around it deeper and more mysterious ; the smell of spice-tea somewherenearby ; and that rich melange odor which radiated from the worm-body . Idaho felt that too much had happened to him too fast since the Tleilaxu had abandoned him to the mercies of Lull and Friend in that featureless prison-cell room . Too much . . . too much .. . Am I really here ? he wondered . Is this me ? What are these thoughts that I think ? He stared at Leto 's quiescent body , the shadowy and enormous mass which lay so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very quietness of that fleshly mass only suggested mysterious energies , terribleenergies which might be unleashed in ways nobody could anticipate . Idaho had heard the stories about the fight at the Ixian Embassy , but the Fish Speaker accounts had an aura of miraculous visitation about them which obscured the physical data . " He flew down from above them and executed a terrible slaughter among the sinners . " " How did he do that ? " Idaho had asked . " He was an angry God , " his informant had said . Angry , Idaho thought . Was it because of the threat to Hwi ? The stories he had heard ! None were believable . Hwi wedded to this gross . . . It was not possible ! Not the lovely Hwi , the Hwi of gentle delicacy . He is playing some terrible game , testing us . . . testing us . . .  |p261There  was no honest reality in these times , no peace except in the presence of Hwi . All else was insanity . As he returned his attention to Leto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of dislocation grew stronger in Idaho . He began to wonder if , by a slight increase in mental effort along some strange new pathway , he might break through ghostly barriers to remember all of the experiences of the other Ghola Idahos . What did they think when they entered this room ? Did they feel this dislocation , this rejection ? Just a little extra effort . He felt dizzy and wondered if he were going to faint . " Is something wrong , Duncan ? " It was Leto 's most reasonable and calming tone . " It 's not real , " Idaho said . " I do n't belong here . " Leto chose to misunderstand . " But my guard tells me you came here of your own accord , that you flew back from the Citadel and demanded an immediate audience . " " I mean here , now ! In this time ! " " But I need you . " " For what ? " " Look around you , Duncan . The ways you can help me are so numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But your women wo n't let me fight ! Every time I want to go where . . . " " Do you question that you 're more valuable alive than dead ? " Leto made a clucking sound , then : " Use your wits , Duncan ! That 's what I value . " " And my sperm . You value that . " " Your sperm is your own to put where you wish . " " I will not leave a widow and orphans behind me the way . . . " " Duncan ! I 've said the choice is yours . " Idaho swallowed , then : " You 've committed a crime against us , Leto , against all of us  --  the gholas you resurrect without ever asking us if that 's what we want . " This was a new turn in Duncan-thinking . Leto peered at Idaho with renewed interest . " What crime ? " " Oh , I 've heard you spouting your deep thoughts , " Idaho accused . He hooked a thumb over his shoulder , pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can be heard out there in the anteroom ? " " When I wish to be heard , yes . " But only my journals hear it all ! " I would like to know the nature of my crime , though . " " There 's a time , Leto , a time when you 're alive . A time whenp262you 're supposed to be alive . It can have a magic , that time , while you 're living it . You know you 're never going to see a time like that again . " Leto blinked , touched by the Duncan 's distress . The words were evocative . Idaho raised both hands , palms up , to chest-height , a beggar asking for something he knew he could not receive . " Then . . . one day you wake up and you remember dying . . . and you remember the axlotl tank . . . and the Tleilaxu nastiness which awakened you . . . and it 's supposed to start all over again . But it does n't . It never does , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken away the magic ? " " Yes ! " Idaho dropped his hands to his sides and clenched them into fists . He felt that he stood alone in the path of a millrace tide which would overwhelm him at his slightest relaxation . And what of my time ? Leto thought . This , too , will never happenagain . But the Duncan would not understand the difference . " What brought you rushing back from the Citadel ? " Leto asked . Idaho took a deep breath , then : " Is it true ? You 're to be mar-ried ? " " That 's correct . " " To this Hwi Noree , the Irian Ambassador ? " " True . " Idaho darted a quick glance along Leto 's supine length . They always look for genitalia , Leto thought . Perhaps I should have something made , a gross protuberance to shock them . He choked back the small burst of amusement which threatened to erupt from his throat . Another emotion amplified . Thank you , Hwi . Thank you , Ixians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There are strong elements to a marriage other than sex , " Leto said . " Will we have children of our flesh ? No . But the effects of this union will be profound . " " I listened while you were talking to Moneo , " Idaho said . " I thought it must be some kind of joke , a . . . " " Careful , Duncan ! " " Do you love her ? " " More deeply than any man ever loved a woman . " " Well , what about her ? Does she . . . " " She feels . . . a compelling compassion , a need to share with me , to give whatever she can give . It is her nature . " Idaho suppressed a feeling of revulsion.  | " Moneo 's right . They 'll believe the Tleilaxu stories . " " That is one of the profound effects . " " And you still want me to . . . to mate with Siona ! " " You know my wishes . I leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman ? " " You 've met Nayla ! Good . " " She and Siona act like sisters . That big hunk ! What 's going on there , Leto ? " " What would you want to go on ? And what does it matter ? " " I 've never met such a brute ! She reminds me of Beast Rabban . You 'd never know she was female if she did n't . . . " " You have met her before , " Leto said . " You knew her as Friend . " Idaho stared at him in quick silence , the silence of a burrowing creature who senses the hawk . " Then you trust her , " Idaho said . " Trust ? What is trust ? " The moment arrives , Leto thought . He could see it shaping in Idaho 's thoughts . " Trust is what goes with a pledge of loyalty , " Idaho said . " Such as the trust between you and me ? " Leto asked . A bitter smile touched Idaho 's lips . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A marriage , a pledge . . . " " Hwi and I already have trust for each other . " " Do you trust me , Leto ? " " If I can not trust Duncan Idaho , I can not trust anyone . " " And if I ca n't trust you ? " " Then I pity you . " Idaho took this as almost a physical shock . His eyes were wide with unspoken demands . He wanted to trust . He wanted the magic which would never come again . Idaho indicated his thoughts were taking off in an odd tangent then . " Can they hear us out in the anteroom ? " he asked . " No . " But my journals hear ! " Moneo was furious . Anyone could see it . But he went away like a docile lamb . " " Moneo is an aristocrat . He is married to duty , to responsibilities . When he is reminded of these things , his anger vanishes . " " So that 's how you control him , " Idaho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remembering how Moneo had glanced up from the notetaking , not for reassurances , but to prompt his sense of duty . " No , " Idaho said . " He does n't control himself . You do it . "  | " Moneo has locked himself into his past . I did not do that . " " But he 's an aristocrat . . . an Atreides . " Leto recalled Moneo 's aging features , thinking how inevitable it was that the aristocrat would refuse his final duty  --  which was to step aside and vanish into history . He would have to be driven aside . And he would be . No aristocrat had ever overcome the demands of change . Idaho was not through . " Are you an aristocrat , Leto ? " Leto smiled . " The ultimate aristocrat dies within me . " And he thought : Privilege becomes arrogance . Arrogance promotes injustice . The seeds of ruin blossom . " Maybe I will not attend your wedding , " Idaho said . " I never thought of myself as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aristocrat of the sword . " " Paul was better , " Idaho said . Leto spoke in the voice of Muad'Dib : " Because you taught me ! " He resumed his normal tones : " The aristocrat 's unspoken duty  --  to teach , and sometimes by horrible example . " And he thought : Pride of birth trails out into penury and the weaknesses of interbreeding . The way is opened for pride of wealth and accomplishment . Enter the nouveau riche , riding to power as the Harkonnens did , on the backs of the ancien regime . The cycle repeated itself with such persistence that Leto felt anyoneshould have seen how it must be built into long forgotten survivalpatterns which the species had outgrown , but never lost . But no , we still carry the detritus which I must weed out . " Is there some frontier ? " Idaho asked . " Is there some frontier where I could go and never again be a part of this ? " " If there is to be any frontier , you must help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now no place to go where others of us can not follow and find you . " " Then you wo n't let me go . " " Go if you wish . Others of you have tried it . I tell you there is no frontier , no place to hide . Right now , as it has been for a long , long time , humankind is like a single-celled creature , bound together by a dangerous glue . " " No new planets ? No strange . . . " " Oh , we grow , but we do not separate . " " Because you hold us together ! " he accused . " I do not know if you can understand this , Duncan , but if there is a frontier , any kind of frontier , then what lies behind you can not be more important than what lies ahead . " " You 're the past ! "  | " No , Moneo is the past . He is quick to raise the traditional aristocraticbarriers against all frontiers . You must understand the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land on those planets , they enclose ideas . They repress change . " " You repress change ! " He will not deviate , Leto thought . One more try . " The surest sign that an aristocracy exists is the discovery of barriersagainst change , curtains of iron or steel or stone or of any substancewhich excludes the new , the different . " " I know there must be a frontier somewhere , " Idaho said . " You 're hiding it . " " I hide nothing of frontiers . I want frontiers ! I want surprises ! " They come right up against it , Leto thought . Then they refuse to enter . True to this prediction , Idaho 's thoughts darted off on a new tack . " Did you really have Face Dancers perform at your betrothal ? " Leto felt a surge of anger , followed immediately by a wry enjoymentof the fact that he could experience the emotion in such depth . He wanted to let it shout at Duncan . . . but that would solve nothing . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I want everyone to share in my happiness . " Idaho stared at him as though just discovering a repellent insect in his drink . In a flat voice , Idaho said : " That is the most cynical thing I have ever heard an Atreides say . " " But an Atreides said it . " " You 're deliberately trying to put me off ! You 're avoiding my question . " Once more into the fray , Leto thought . He said : " The Face Dancers of the Bene Tleilax are a colony organism . Individually , they are mules . This is a choice they made for and by themselves . " Leto waited , thinking : I must be patient . They have to discover it for themselves . If I say it , they will not believe . Think , Duncan . Think ! After a long silence , Idaho said : " I have given you my oath . That is important to me . It is still important . I do n't know what you 're doing or why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's happening . There ! I 've said it . " " Is that why you returned from the Citadel ? " " Yes ! " " Will you go back to the Citadel now ? " " What other frontier is there ? "  | " Very good , Duncan ! Your anger knows even when your reason does not . Hwi goes to the Citadel tonight . I will join her there to-morrow . " " I want to get to know her better , " Idaho said . " You will avoid her , " Leto said . " That is an order . Hwi is not for you . " " I 've always known there were witches , " Idaho said . " Your grandmother was one . " He turned on his heel and , not asking leave , strode back the way he had come . How like a little boy he is , Leto thought , watching the stiffness in Idaho 's back . The oldest man in our universe and the youngest  --  both in one flesh.  |p267The  prophet is not diverted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of language determines such linear distinctions .

" They were in the airy room of golden stone atop the Citadel 's south tower , Leto 's third full day back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him looked out over the harsh noonday of the Sareer . The wind made a deep humming sound through the opening . It stirred up dust and sand which made Moneo squint . Leto seemed not to notice the irritation . He stared out across the Sareer , where the air was alive with heat movements . The distant flow of dunes suggested a mobility in the landscape which only his eyes observed . Moneo stood immersed in the sour odors of his own fear , knowing that the wind conveyed the message of these odors to Leto 's senses . The arrangements for the wedding , the upset among the Fish Speakers  --  everything was paradox . It reminded Moneo of something the God Emperor had said in the first days of their association . " Paradox is a pointer telling you to look beyond it . If paradoxes bother you , that betrays your deep desire for absolutes . The relativist treats a paradox merely as interesting , perhaps amusing or even , dreadful thought , educational . " " You do not respond , " Leto said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weight of his attention on Moneo . Moneo could only shrug . How near is the Worm ? he wondered . Moneo had noticed that the return to the Citadel from Onn sometimesaroused the Worm . No sign of that awful shift in the God Emperor'spresence had yet betrayed itself , but Moneo sensed it . Could the Worm come without warning ? " Accelerate arrangements for the wedding , " Leto said . " Make it as soon as possible . " " Before you test Siona ? " Leto was silent for a moment , then : " No . What will you do about the Duncan ? " " What would you have me do , Lord ? " " I told him not to see Noree , to avoid her . I told him it was an order . " " She has sympathy for him , Lord . Nothing more . " " Why would she have sympathy for him ? " " He is a ghola . He has no connection to our times , no roots . " " He has roots as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know this , Lord . " " Are you arguing with me , Moneo ? " Moneo backed away a half step , knowing that this did not remove him from danger . " Oh , no , Lord . But I always try to tell you truly what I believe is happening . " " I will tell you what is happening . He is courting her . " " But she initiates their meetings , Lord . " " Then you knew about this ! "  | " I did not know you had absolutely prohibited it , Lord . " Leto spoke in a musing voice : " He is clever with women , Moneo , exceedingly clever . He sees into their souls and makes them do what he wants . It has always been that way with the Duncans . " " I did not know you had prohibited all meetings between them , Lord ! " Moneo 's voice was almost strident . " He is more dangerous than any of the others , " Leto said . " It is the fault of our times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a successor for him ready to deliver . " " And we need this one ? " " You said it yourself , Lord . It is a paradox which I do not understand , but you did say it . " " How long until there could be a replacement ? " " At least a year , Lord . Shall I inquire as to a specific date ? " " Do it today . " " He may hear about it , Lord . The previous one did . " " I do not want it to happen this way , Moneo ! " " I know , Lord . " " And I dare not speak of this to Noree , " Leto said . " The Duncan is not for her . Yet , I can not hurt her ! " This last was almost a wail . Moneo stood in awed silence . " Ca n't you see this ? " Leto demanded . " Moneo , help me . " " I see that it is different with Noree , " Moneo said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What is different ? " Leto 's voice had a penetrating quality which cut right through Moneo . " I mean your attitude toward her , Lord . It is different from anything I have ever seen in you . " Moneo noted then the first signs  --  twitching in the God Emperor'shands , the beginning glaze in the eyes . Gods ! The Worm is coming ! Moneo felt totally exposed . A simple flick of the great body wouldcrush Moneo against a wall . I must appeal to the human in him . " Lord , " Moneo said , " I have read the accounts and heard yourown words about your marriage to your sister , Ghanima . " " If only she were with me now , " Leto said . " She was never your mate , Lord . " " What 're you suggesting ? " Leto demanded . The twitching of Leto 's hands had become a spasmodic vibration . " She was . . . I mean , Lord , that Ghanima was Harq al-Ada 's mate . " " Of course she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! "  | " Is there something you have not told me , Lord ? Is it possible . . . that is , with Hwi Noree . . . could you mate ? " Leto 's hands shook so strongly Moneo wondered that their owner did not know it . The glazing of the great blue eyes deepened . Moneo backed another step toward the door to the stairs leading down from this deadly place . " Do not question me about possibilities , " Leto said , and his voice was hideously distant , gone somewhere into the layers of his past . " Never again , Lord , " Moneo said . He bowed himself back to only a single pace from the door . " I will speak to Noree , Lord . . . and to the Duncan . " " Do what you can . " Leto 's voice was far away in those interior chambers which only he could enter . Softly , Moneo let himself out of the door . He closed it behind him and placed his back against it , trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paradox remained . Where did it point ? What was the meaning of the God Emperor 's odd and painful decisions ? What had brought The Worm Who Is God ? A thumping sounded from within Leto 's aerie , a heavy beating against stone . Moneo dared not open the door to investigate . He pushed himself away from the surface which reflected that dreadful thumping and went down the stairs , moving cautiously , not drawing an easy breath until he reached ground level and the Fish Speaker guard there . " Is he disturbed ? " she asked , looking up the stairs . Moneo nodded . They both could hear the thumping quite plainly . " What disturbs him ? " the guard asked . " He is God and we are mortal , " Moneo said . This was an answer which usually satisfied Fish Speakers , but new forces were at work now . She looked directly at him and Moneo saw the killer training close to the surface of her soft features . She was a relatively young woman with auburn hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips , but now her eyes were hard and demanding . Only a fool would turn his back on those eyes . " I did not disturb him , " Moneo said . " Of course not , " she agreed . Her look softened slightly . " But I would like to know who or what did . " " I think he is impatient for his marriage , " Moneo said . " I think that 's all it is . " " Then hurry the day ! " she said . " That 's what I 'm about , " Moneo said . He turned and hurriedp271away down the long hall to his own area of the Citadel . Gods ! The Fish Speakers were becoming as dangerous as the God Emperor . That stupid Duncan ! He puts us all in peril ! And Hwi Noreel What 's to be done about her ?  |p272The  pattern of monarchies and similar systems has amessage of value for all political forms .

He told Moneo that he would see her at the Little Citadel , a vantage tower he had built in the central Sareer . The site had been chosen to provide views of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Little Citadel . Visitors arrived by ' thopter . Leto went there as though by magic . With his own hands , in the early days of his ascendancy , Leto had used an Ixian machine to dig a secret tunnel under the Sareer to his tower , doing all of the work himself . In those days , a few wild sandwormsstill roamed the desert . He had lined his tunnel with massive walls of fused silica and had imbedded countless bubbles of wormrepellingwater in the outer layers . The tunnel anticipated his maximumgrowth and the requirements of a Royal Cart which , at that time , had been only a figment of his visions . In the early predawn hours of the day assigned to Siona , Leto descended to the crypt and gave orders to his guard that he was not to be disturbed by anyone . His cart sped him down one of the crypt 's dark spokes where he opened a hidden portal , emerging in less than an hour at the Little Citadel . One of his delights was to go out alone onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry him . The sand felt luxuriously sensuousagainst him . The heat of his passage through the dunes in the day 's first light sent up a wake of steam which required him to keep moving . He brought himself to a stop only when he found a relativelydry pocket about five kilometers out . He lay there at the center of an uncomfortable dampness from the trace-dew , his body just outside the long shadow of the tower which stretched eastward from him across the dunes . From a distance , the three thousand meters of the tower could be seen as an impossible needle stabbing the sky . Only the inspired blend of Leto 's commands and Ixian imagination made the structure conceivable . One hundred and fifty meters in diameter , the tower sat on a foundation which plunged as deeply under the sand as it climbed above . The magic of plasteel and superlight alloys kept it supple in the wind and resistant to sandblast abrasions . Leto enjoyed the place so much that he rationed his visits , making up a long list of personal rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " Great Necessity . " For a few moments while he lay there , he could shed the loads of the Golden Path . Moneo , good and reliable Moneo , would see that Siona arrived promptly , just at nightfall . Leto had a full day in which to relax and think , to play and pretend that he possessed no cares , to drink up the raw sustenance of the earth in a feeding frenzy which he could never indulge in at Onn or at the Citadel . In those places , hep274was required to confine himself to furtive burrowings through narrow passages where only prescient caution kept him from encountering water-pockets . Here , though , he could race through the sand and across it , feed and grow strong . Sand crunched beneath him as he rolled , flexing his body in pure animal enjoyment . He could feel his worm-self being restored , an electric sensation which sent messages of health all through him . The sun was well above the horizon now , painting a golden line up the side of the tower . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an odor of distant spiny plants which had responded to the morning 's trace-dew . Gently at first , then more rapidly , he moved out in a wide circle around the tower , thinking about Siona as he went . There could be no more delays . She had to be tested . Moneo knew this as well as Leto did . Just that morning , Moneo had said : " Lord , there is terrible violencein her . " " She has the beginnings of adrenalin addiction , " Leto had said . " It 's cold-turkey time . " " Cold what , Lord ? " " It 's an ancient expression . It means she must be subjected to a complete withdrawal . She must go through a necessity-shock . " " Oh . . . I see . " For once , Leto realized , Moneo did see . Moneo had gone through his own cold-turkey time . " The young generally are incapable of making hard decisions unlessthose decisions are associated with immediate violence and the consequent sharp flow of adrenalin , " Leto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remembering , then : " It is a great peril . " " That 's the violence you see in Siona . Even old people can cling to it , but the young wallow in it . " As he circled his tower in the growing light of the day , enjoying the feel of the sand even more as it dried , Leto thought about the conversation . He slowed his passage over the sand . A wind from behind him carried the vented oxygen and a burnt-flint smell over his human nostrils . He inhaled deeply , lifting his magnified awareness to a new level . This preliminary day contained a multiple purpose . He thought of the coming encounter much as an ancient bullfighter had thought about the first examination of a horned adversary . Siona possessed her own version of horns , although Moneo would make certain that she brought no physical weapons to this encounter . Leto had to be sure , though , that he knew Siona 's every strength and every weak/ness . And he would have to create special susceptibilities in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test , her psychic muscles blunted by well-planted barbs . Shortly after noon , his worm-self satiated , Leto returned to the tower , crawled back onto his cart and lifted on suspensors to the very tip and a portal there which opened only at his command . Throughoutthe rest of the day , he lay in the aerie , thinking , plotting . The fluttering wings of an ornithopter whispered on the air just at nightfall to signal Moneo 's arrival . Faithful Moneo . Leto caused a landing-lip to extrude from his aerie . The ' thopter glided in , its wings cupped . It settled gently onto the lip . Leto stared out through the gathering darkness . Siona emerged and darted in toward him , fearful of the unprotected height . She wore a white robe over a black uniform without insignia . She stole one look backward when she stopped just inside the tower , then she turned her attention to Leto 's bulk waiting on the cart almost at the center of the aerie . The ' thopter lifted away and jetted off into the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There is a balcony on the other side of the tower , " he said . " We will go there . " " Why ? " Siona 's voice carried almost pure suspicion . " I 'm told it 's a cool place , " Leto said . " And there is indeed a faint sensation of cold on my cheeks when I expose them to the breeze there . " Curiosity brought her closer to him . Leto closed the portal behind her . " The night view from the balcony is magnificent , " Leto said . " Why are we here ? " " Because here we will not be overheard . " Leto turned his cart and moved it silently out to the balcony . The faintest of hidden illumination within the aerie showed her his movement . He heard her follow . The balcony was a half-ring on the southeast arc of the tower , a lacy railing at chest-height around the perimeter . Siona moved to the rail and swept her gaze around the open land . Leto sensed the waiting receptivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . Whatever it was , she would listen and respondfrom the well of her own motives . Leto looked across her toward the edge of the Sareer where the man-made boundary wall was a low flat line just barely visible in the light of First Moon lifting above the horizon . His amplified vision identified the distant move/ment of a convoy from Onn , a dull glow of lights from the beastdrawnvehicles pacing along the high road toward Tabur Village . He could call up a memory-image of the village nestled among the plants which grew in the moist area along the inner base of the wall . His Museum Fremen tended date palms , tall grasses and even truck gardens there . It was not like the old days when any inhabited place , even a tiny basin with a few low plants fed by a single cistern and windtrap , could appear lush by comparison with the open sand . Tabur Village was a water-rich paradise when compared with Sietch Tabr . Everyone in today 's village knew that just beyond the Sareer 's boundary wall the Idaho river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver now in the moonlight . Museum Fremen could not climb the wall 's sheer inner face , but they knew the water was there . The earth knew , too . If a Tabur inhabitant put an ear against the ground , the earth spoke with the sound of distant rapids . There would be nightbirds along the bankment now , Leto thought , creatures which would live in sunlight on another world . Dune had worked its evolutionary magic on them and they still lived at the mercies of the Sareer . Leto had seen the birds draw dumb shadows across the water and , when they dipped to drink , there were ripples which the river took away . Even at this distance , Leto sensed a power in that faraway water , something forceful out of his past which moved away from him like the current slipping southward into the reaches of farm and forest . The water searched through rolling hills , along the margins of an abundant plantlife which had replaced all of Dune 's desert except for this one last place , this Sareer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growling thrust of Irian machines which had inflicted that watercourse upon the landscape . It seemed such a short time ago , little more than three thousand years . Siona stirred and looked back at him , but Leto remained silent , his attention fixed beyond her . A pale amber light shone above the horizon , reflection of a town on faraway clouds . From its direction and distance , Leto knew it to be the town of Wallport transplanted far into a warmer clime of the south from its once-austere location in the cold , low-slanted light of the north . The glow of the town was like a window into his past . He felt the beam of it striking through to his breast , straight through the thick and scaled membrane which had replacedhis human skin . I am vulnerable , he thought . Yet , he knew himself to be the master of this place . And the planet was the master of him . I am part of it.  |p277He  devoured the soil directly , rejecting only the water . His human mouth and lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity . . . and talking . Leto spoke to Siona 's back : " I like to talk and I dread the day when I no longer will be able to engage in conversations . " With a certain diffidence , she turned and stared at him in the moonlight , quite obvious distaste in her expression . " I agree that I am a monster in many human eyes , " he said . " Why am I here ? " Directly to the point ! She would not deviate . Most of the Atreides had been that way , he thought . It was a characteristic which he hoped to maintain in the breeding of them . It spoke of a strong inner sense of identity . " I need to find out what Time has done to you , " he said . " Why do you need that ? " A little fear in her voice there , he thought . She thinks I will probe after her puny rebellion and the names of her surviving associates . When he remained silent , she said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed my friends ? " So she has heard about the fight at the Embassy . And she assumes I know all about her past rebellious activities . Moneo has been lecturingher , damn him ! Well . . . I might have done the same in his circumstances . " Are you really a god ? " she demanded . " I do n't understand why my father believes that . " She has some doubts , he thought . I still have room to maneuver . " Definitions vary , " he said . " To Moneo , I am a god . . . and that is a truth . " " You were human once . " He began to enjoy the leaps of her intellect . She had that sure , hunting curiosity which was the hallmark of the Atreides . " You are curious about me , " he said . " It is the same with me . I am curious about you . " " What makes you think I 'm curious ? " " You used to watch me very carefully when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your eyes tonight . " " Yes , I have wondered what it 's like to be you . " He studied her for a moment . The moonlight drew shadows under her eyes , concealing them . He could let himself imagine that her eyes were the total blue of his own eyes , the blue of spice addiction . With that imaginative addition , Siona bore a curious resemblance to his long-dead Ghani . It was in the outline of her face and the placement of the eyes . He almost told Siona this , then thought better of it.  | " Do you eat human food ? " Siona asked . " For a long time after I put on the sandtrout skin , I felt stomach hunger , " he said . " Occasionally , I would attempt food . My stomach mostly rejected it . The cilia of the sandtrout spread almost everywherein my human flesh . Eating became a bothersome thing . These days , I only ingest dry substances which sometimes contain a bit of the spice . " " You . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you no longer have human hungers ? " " I did n't say that . " She stared at him , waiting . Leto admired the way she let unspoken questions work for her . She was bright and she had learned much during her short life . " The stomach hunger was a black feeling , a pain I could not relieve , " he said . " I would run then , run like an insane creature across the dunes . " " You . . . ran ? " " My legs were longer in proportion to my body in those days . I could move myself about quite easily . But the hungry pain has never left me . I think it 's hunger for my lost humanity . " He saw the beginnings of reluctant sympathy in her , the questioning . " You still have this . . . pain ? " " It 's only a soft burning now . That 's one of the signs of my final metamorphosis . In a few hundred years , I 'll be back under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sides . " Why ? " she demanded . " Why did you do this ? " " This change is n't all bad . Today , for example , has been very pleasant . I feel quite mellow . " " There are changes we can not see , " she said . " I know there must be . " She relaxed her hands . " My sight and hearing have become extremely acute , but not my sense of touch . Except for my face , I do n't feel things the way I could once . I miss that . " Again , he noted the reluctant sympathy , the striving toward an empathic understanding . She wanted to know ! " When you live so long , " she said , " how does the passage of Time feel ? Does it move more rapidly as the years go by ? " " That 's a strange thing , Siona . Sometimes , Time rushes by me ; sometimes , it creeps . " Gradually , as they spoke , Leto had been dimming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and closer to Siona . Now ,  |p279he  shut off the lights , leaving only the moon . The front of his cart protruded onto the balcony , his face only about two meters from Siona . " My father tells me , " she said , " that the older you get , the slower your time goes . Is that what you told him ? " Testing my veracity , he thought . She 's not a Truthsayer , then . " All things are relative , but compared to the human timesense , this is true . " " Why ? " " It is involved in what I will become . At the end , Time will stop for me and I will be frozen like a pearl caught in ice . My new bodies will scatter , each with a pearl hidden within it . " She turned and looked away from him , peering out at the desert , speaking without looking at him . " When I talk to you like this here in the darkness I can almost forget what you are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our meeting . " , " But why this place ? " " Because it is the last place where I can feel at home . " Siona turned against the rail , leaning on it and looking at him . " I want to see you . " He turned on all of the aerie 's lights , including the harsh white globes along the roof of the balcony 's outer edge . As the light came on , an Irian-made transparent mask slid out of wall recesses and sealed off the balcony behind Siona . She felt it move behind her and was startled , but nodded as though she understood . She thought it was a defense against attack . It was not . The wall merely kept out the damp insects of the night . Siona stared at Leto , sweeping her gaze along his body , pausing at the stubs which once had been his legs , bringing her attention then to his arms and hands , then to his face . " Your approved histories tell us that all Atreides are descended from you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Oral History disagrees . " " The Oral History is correct . Your ancestor was Harq al-Ada . Ghani and I were married only in name , a move to consolidate the power . " " Like your marriage to this Ixian woman ? " " That is different . " " You will have children ? " " I have never been capable of having children . I chose the metamorphosisbefore that was possible . " " You were a child and then you were  --  " she pointed  --  " this ? "  | " Nothing between . " " How does a child know what to choose ? " " I was one of the oldest children this universe has ever seen . Uhani was the other . " " That story about your ancestral memories ! " " A true story . We 're all here . Does n't the Oral History agree ? " She whirled away and held her back stiffly presented to him . Oncemore , Leto found himself fascinated by this human gesture : rejectioncoupled to vulnerability . Presently , she turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have the Atreides look , " she said . " I come by it just as honestly as you do . " " You 're so old . . . why are n't you wrinkled ? " " Nothing about the human part of me ages in a normal way . " " Is that why you did this to yourself ? " " To enjoy long life ? No . " " I do n't see how anyone could make such a choice , " she muttered . Then louder : " Never to know love . . . " " You 're playing the fool ! " he said . " You do n't mean love , you mean sex . " She shrugged . " You think the most terrible thing I gave up was sex ? No , the greatest loss was something far different . " " What ? " She asked it reluctantly , betraying how deeply he touched her . " I can not walk among my fellows without their special notice . I am no longer one of you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but my shape keeps us apart . We are separated , Siona , by a gulf that no other human dares to bridge . " " Not even your Ixian woman ? " " Yes , she would if she could , but she can not . She 's not an Atreides . " " You mean that I . . . could ? " She touched her breast with a finger . " If there were enough sandtrout around . Unfortunately , all of them enclose my flesh . However , if I were to die . . . " She shook her head in dumb horror at the thought . " The Oral History tells it accurately , " he said . " And we must never forget that you believe the Oral History . " She continued to shake her head from side to side . " There 's no secret about it , " he said . " The first moments of the transformation are the critical ones . Your awareness must drive inwardand outward simultaneously , one with Infinity . I could providep281you with enough melange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live through those first awful moments . . . and all the other moments . " She shuddered uncontrollably , her gaze fixed on his eyes . " You know I 'm telling you the truth , do n't you ? " She nodded , inhaled a deep trembling breath , then : " Why did you do it ? " " The alternative was far more horrible . " " What alternative ? " " In time , you may understand it . Moneo did . " " Your damned Golden Path ! " " Not damned at all . Quite holy . " " You think I 'm a fool who ca n't . . . " " I think you 're inexperienced , but possessed of great capability whose potential you do not even suspect . " She took three deep breaths and regained some of her composure , then : " If you ca n't mate with the Ixian , what . . . " " Child , why do you persist in misunderstanding ? It 's not sex . BeforeHwi , I could not pair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cosmicvoid , I was the only one . " " She 's like . . . you ? " " Deliberately so . The Ixians made her that way . " " Made her . . . " " Do n't be a complete fool ! " he snapped . " She is the essential godtrap . Even the victim can not reject her . " " Why do you tell me these things ? " she whispered . " You stole two copies of my journals , " he said . " You 've read the Guild translations and you already know what could catch me . " " You knew ? " He saw boldness return to her stance , a sense of her own power . " Of course you knew , " she said , answering her own question . " It was my secret , " he said . " You can not imagine how many times I have loved a companion and seen that companion slip away . . . as your father is slipping away now . " " You love . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes they go quickly ; sometimes with agonizing slowness . Each time I am wracked . I can play callous and I can make the necessary decisions , even decisions which kill , but I can not escape the suffering . For a long , long time  --  those journalsyou stole tell it truly  --  that was the only emotion I knew . " He saw the moistness in her eyes , but the line of her jaw still spoke of angry resolution . " None of this gives you the right to govern , " she said.  |p282Leto  suppressed a smile . At last they were down to the root of Siona 's rebellion . By what right ? Where is justice in my rule ? By imposing my rules upon them with the weight of Fish Speaker arms , am I being fair to the evolutionary thrust of humankind ? I know all of the revolutionary cant , the catch-prattle and the resounding phrases . " Nowhere do you see your own rebellious hand in the power I wield , " he said . Her youth still demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " But you strengthen me . " " How ? " " By opposing me . I sharpen my claws on the likes of you . " She shot a sudden glance at his hands . " A figure of speech , " he said . " So I 've offended you at last , " she said , hearing only the cutting anger in his words and tone . " You 've not offended me . We 're related and can speak bluntly to each other within the family . The fact is , I have much more to fear from you than you from me . " This took her aback , but only momentarily . He saw belief stiffen her shoulders , then doubt . Her chin lowered and she peered upward at him . " What could the great God Leto fear from me ? " " Your ignorant violence . " " Are you saying that you 're physically vulnerable ? " " I will not warn you again , Siona . There are limits to the word games I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the ones I love who are physically vulnerable . Soon , most of the Empire will know it . This is the kind of information which travels fast . " " And they 'll all ask what right you have to rule ! " There was glee in her voice . It aroused an abrupt anger in Leto . He found it difficult to suppress . This was a side of human emotions he detested . Gloating ! It was some time before he dared answer , then he chose to slash through her defenses at the vulnerability he already had seen . " I rule by the right of loneliness , Siona . My loneliness is partfreedomand part-slavery . It says I can not be bought by any human group . My slavery to you says that I will serve all of you to the best of my lordly abilities . " " But the Ixians have caught you ! " she said . " No . They have given me a gift which strengthens me . " " It weakens you ! "  | " That , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still obey me . " " Ohhh , yes . " She nodded . " I understand that . " " You do n't understand it . " " Then I 'm sure you 'll explain it to me , " she taunted . He spoke so softly that she had to lean toward him to hear : " There are no others of any kind anywhere who can call upon me for anything  --  not for sharing , not for compromise , not even for the slightest beginning of another government . I am the only one . " " Not even this Ixian woman can . . . " " She is so much like me that she would not weaken me in that way . " " But when the Irian Embassy was attacked . . . " " I can still be irritated by stupidity , " he said . She scowled at him . Leto thought it a pretty gesture in that light , quite unconscious . He knew he had made her think . He was sure she had never before considered that any rights might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There has never before been a government exactly like mine . Not in all of our history . I am responsibleonly to myself , exacting payment in full for what I have sac-rificed . " " Sacrificed ! " she sneered , but he heard the doubts . " Every despot says something like that . You 're responsible only to yourself ! " " Which makes every living thing my responsibility . I watch over you through these times . " " Through what times ? " " The times that might have been and then no more . " He saw the indecision in her . She did not trust her instincts , her untrained abilities at prediction . She might leap occasionally as she had done when she took his journals , but the motivation for the leap was lost in the revelation which followed .

A majordomo brought it to me one day to amuse me . The story says there is a hoard of melange , a gigantic hoard , big as a great mountain . The hoard is concealed in the depths of a distant planet . It is not Arrakis , that planet . It is not Dune . The spice was hiddenthere long ago , even before the First Empire and the Spacing Guild . The story says Paul Muad'Dib went there and lives yet beside the hoard , kept alive by it , waiting . The majordomo did not understand why the story disturbedme.  --  The Stolen JournalsIdaho trembled with anger as he strode along the gray plastone halls toward his quarters in the Citadel . At each guard post he passed , the woman there snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was causing disturbance among them . Nobody could mistake the Commander 's mood . But he did not abate his purposeful stride . The heavy thumping of his boots echoed along the walls . He could still taste the noon meal  --  oddly familiar Atreides chopstick-fareof mixed grains herb-seasoned and baked around a pungent morsel of pseudomeat , all of it washed down with a drink of clearp286cidrit juice . Moneo had found him at table in the Guard Mess , alone in a corner with a regional operations schedule propped up beside his plate . Without invitation , Moneo had seated himself opposite Idaho and had pushed aside the operations schedule . " I bring a message from the God Emperor , " Moneo said . The tightly controlled tone warned Idaho that this was no casualencounter . Others sensed it . Listening silence settled over the womenat nearby tables , spreading out through the room . Idaho put down his chopsticks . " Yes ? " " These were the words of the God Emperor , " Moneo said . " It is my bad luck that Duncan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not continue . " Anger thinned Idaho 's lips , but he remained silent . " Such foolishness endangers us all , " Moneo said . " Noree is the God Emperor 's intended . " Idaho tried to control his anger , but the words were a betrayal : " He ca n't marry her ! " " Why not ? " " What game is he playing , Moneo ? " " I am a messenger with a single message , no more , " Moneo said . Idaho 's voice was low and threatening . " But he confides in you . " " The God Emperor sympathizes with you , " Moneo lied . " Sympathizes ! " Idaho shouted the word , creating a new depth tothe room 's silence . " Noree is a woman of obvious attractions , " Moneo said . " But she is not for you . " " The God Emperor has spoken , " Idaho sneered , " and there is no appeal . " " I see that you understand the message , " Moneo said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where are you going ? " Moneo demanded . " I 'm going to have this out with him right now ! " " That is certain suicide , " Moneo said . Idaho glared at him , aware suddenly of the listening intensity in the women at the tables around them . An expression which Muad'Dib would have recognized immediately came over Idaho 's face : " Playing to the Devil 's Gallery , " Muad'Dib had called it . " D' you know what the original Atreides Dukes always said ? " Idaho asked . There was a mocking tone in his voice . " Is it pertinent ? " " They said your liberties all vanish when you look up to any absoluteruler. "  |p287Rigid  with fear , Moneo leaned toward Idaho . Moneo 's lips barely moved . His voice was little more than a whisper . " Do n't say such things . " " Because one of these women will report it ? " Moneo shook his head in disbelief . " You are more reckless than any of the others . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extreme to take this attitude . " Idaho heard the nervous stirring that swept through the room . " He can only kill us , " Idaho said . Moneo spoke in a tight whisper : " You fool ! The Worm can dominatehim at the slightest provocation ! " " The Worm , you say ? " Idaho 's voice was unnecessarily loud . " You must trust him , " Moneo said . Idaho glanced left and right . " Yes , I think they heard that . " " He is billions upon billions of people united in that one body , " Moneo said . " So I 've been told . " " He is God and we are mortal , " Moneo said . " How is it a god can do evil things ? " Idaho asked . Moneo thrust his chair backward and leaped to his feet . " I wash my hands of you ! " Whirling away , he dashed from the room . Idaho looked out into the room , finding himself the center of attentionfor all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I do , " Idaho said . It surprised him then to glimpse a few wry smiles among the women . They all returned to their eating . As he strode down the hall of the Citadel , Idaho replayed the conversation , seeking out the oddities in Moneo 's behavior . The terror could be recognized and even understood , but it had seemed far more than fear of death . . . far , far more . The Worm can dominate him . Idaho felt that this had slipped out of Moneo , an inadvertent betrayal . What could it mean ? More reckless than any of the others . It galled Idaho that he should have to bear comparison to himselfas-an-unknown . How careful had the others been ? Idaho came to his own door , put a hand on the palm-lock and hesitated . He felt like a hunted animal retreating to his den . The guards in the mess surely would have reported that conversation to Leto by now . What would the God Emperor do ? Idaho 's hand moved across the lock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment and sealed the door , looking at it.  |p288Will  he send his Fish Speakers for me ? Idaho glanced around the entry area . It was a conventional space  --  racks for clothing and shoes , a full-length mirror , a weapons cupboard . He looked at the closed door of the cupboard . Not one of the weapons behind that door offered any real threat to the God Emperor . There was n't even a lasgun . . . although even lasguns were ineffectual against the Worm , according to all the accounts . He knows I will defy him . Idaho sighed and looked toward the arched portal which led into the sitting area . Moneo had replaced the soft furniture with heavier , stiffer pieces , some of them recognizably Fremen  --  culled from the coffers of the Museum Fremen . Museum Fremen ! Idaho spat and strode through the portal . Two steps into the room he stopped , shocked . The soft light from the north windows revealed Hwi Noree seated on the low sling-divan . She wore a shimmering blue gown which draped itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance . " Thank the gods you 've not been harmed , " she said . Idaho glanced back at his entry , at the palm-locked door . He returneda speculative look to Hwi . No one but a few selected guards should be able to open that door . She smiled at his confusion . " We Ixians manufactured those locks , " she said . He found himself filled with fear for her . " What are you doing here ? " " We must talk . " " About what ? " " Duncan . . . " She shook her head . " About us . " " They warned you , " he said . " I 've been told to reject you . " " Moneo sent you ! " " Two guardswomen who overheard you in the mess  --  they brought me . They think you are in terrible danger . " " Is that why you 're here ? " She stood , one graceful motion which reminded him of the way Leto 's grandmother , Jessica , had moved  --  the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came as a shock . " You 're Bene Gesserit . . . " " No ! They were among my teachers , but I am not Bene Gesserit . " Suspicions clouded his mind . What allegiances were really at workin Leto 's Empire ? What does a ghola know about such things ? The changes since last I lived .. .  | " I suppose you 're still just a simple Ixian , " he said . " Please do n't sneer at me , Duncan . " " What are you ? " " I am the intended bride of the God Emperor . " " And you 'll serve him faithfully ! " " I will . " " Then there 's nothing for us to talk about . " " Except this thing between us . " He cleared his throat . " What thing ? " " This attraction . " She raised a hand as he started to speak . " I want to hurl myself into your arms , to find the love and shelter I know is there . You want it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The God Emperor forbids ! " " But I am here . " She took two steps toward him , the gown ripplingacross her body . " Hwi . . . " He tried to swallow in a dry throat . " It 's best you leave . " " Prudent , but not best , " she said . " If he finds that you 've been here . . . " " It is not my way to leave you like this . " Again , she stopped his response with a lifted hand . " I was bred and trained for just one pur-pose . " Her words filled him with icy caution . " What purpose ? " " To woo the God Emperor . Oh , he knows this . He would not change a thing about me . " " Nor would I. " She moved a step closer . He smelled the milky warmth of her breath . " They made me too well , " she said . " I was designed to please an Atreides . Leto says his Duncan is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leto ? " " How else should I address the one I 'll wed ? " Even as she spoke , Hwi leaned toward Idaho . As though a magnet had found its point of critical attraction , they moved together . Hwi pressed her cheek against his tunic , her arms around him feeling the hard muscles . Idaho rested his chin in her hair , the musk filling his senses . " This is insane , " he whispered . " Yes . " He lifted her chin and kissed her . She pressed herself against him.  |p290Neither  of them doubted where this must lead . She did not resist when he lifted her off her feet and carried her into the bedroom . Only once did Idaho speak . " You 're not a virgin . " " Nor are you , love . " " Love , " he whispered . " Love , love , love . . . " " Yes . . . yes ! " In the post-coital peace , Hwi put both hands behind her head and stretched , twisting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her looking out the window . " Who were your other lovers ? " he asked . She lifted herself on one elbow . " I 've had no other lovers . " " But . . . " He turned and looked down at her . " In my teens , " she said , " there was a young man who needed me very much . " She smiled . " Afterward , I was very ashamed . How trusting I was ! I thought I had failed the people who depended on me . But they found out and they were elated . You know , I think I was being tested . " Idaho scowled . " Is that how it was with me ? I needed you ? " " No , Duncan . " Her features were grave . " We gave joy to each other because that 's how it is with love . " " Love ! " he said , and it was a bitter sound . She said : " My Uncle Malky used to say that love was a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malky was a wise man . " " He was stupid ! Love needs no guarantees . " A smile twitched at the corners of Idaho 's mouth . She grinned up at him . " You know it 's love when you want to give joy and damn the consequences . " He nodded . " I think only of the danger to you . " " We are what we are , " she said . " What will we do ? " " We 'll cherish this for as long as we live . " " You sound . . . so final . " " I am . " " But we 'll see each other every . . . " " Never again like this . " " Hwi ! " He hurled himself across the bed and buried his face in her breast . She stroked his hair . His voice muffled against her , he said : " What if I 've impreg . .. " " Shush ! If there 's to be a child , there will be a child . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he 'll know for sure ! " " He 'll know anyway . "  | " You think he really knows everything ? " " Not everything , but he 'll know this . " " How ? " " I will tell him .

You could be in terrible danger ! " " No . I have needs , too . He knows this . He will not harm either of us . " " But he . . . " " He will not destroy me . He will know that if he harms you that would destroy me . " " How can you marry him ? " " Dear Duncan , have you not seen that he needs me more than you do ? " " But he can not . . .

Needs larger than either of us have . " " What plans ? What needs ? " " Ask him . " " Do you know ? " " Yes . " " You mean you believe those stories about . . . " " There is honesty and goodness in him . I know it by my own responsesto him . What my Ixian masters made in me was , I think , a reagent which reveals more than they wanted me to know .

"  |p292Memory  has a curious meaning to me , a meaning I have hoped others might share . It continually astonished me how people hide from their ancestral memories , shielding themselves behind a thick barrier of mythos . Ohhh , I do not expect them to seek the terrible immediacy of every living moment which I must experience . I can understand that they might not want to be submerged in a mush of petty ancestral details . You have reason to fear that your living moments might be taken over by others . Yet , the meaning is there within those memories . We carry all of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes and joys and griefs , the agonies and the exultations of our past .

They stood in the dankness of the crypt where , Moneo remindedp293himself , some of the God Emperor 's most painful decisions originated . Moneo , too , had heard reports . He had been expecting the summons all afternoon and , when it came shortly after the evening meal , a moment of terror had engulfed him . " Is it about . . . about the Duncan , Lord ? " " Of course it 's about the Duncan ! " " I 'm told , Lord . . . his behavior . . . " " Terminal behavior , Moneo ? " Moneo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord . " " How long until the Tleilaxu could supply us with another one ? " " They say they have had problems , Lord . It might be as much as two years . " " Do you know what my guards tell me , Moneo ? " Moneo held his breath . If the God Emperor had learned about this latest . . . No ! Even the Fish Speakers were terrified by the affront . Had it been anyone but a Duncan , the women would have taken it upon themselves to eliminate him . " Well , Moneo ? " " I am told , Lord , that he called out a levy of guards and questionedthem about their origins . On what worlds were they born ? What of their parentage , their childhood ? " " And the answers did not please him . " " He frightened them , Lord . He kept insisting . " " As though repetition could elicit the truth , yes . " Moneo allowed himself to hope that this might be the whole of his Lord 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lord ? " " It was their early training , the Atreides training . " " But how did that differ from . . . " " The Atreides lived in the service of the people they governed . The measure of their government was found in the lives of the governed . Thus , the Duncans always want to know how the people live . " " He has spent a night in one village , Lord . He has been to some of the towns . He has seen . . . " " It 's all in how you interpret the results , Moneo . Evidence is nothingwithout judgments . " " I have observed that he judges , Lord . " " We all do , but the Duncans tend to believe that this universe is hostage to my will . And they know that you can not do wrong in the name of right . " " Is that what he says you . . . " " It is what I say , what all of the Atreides in me say . This universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not endure if you . . . "  | " But , Lord ! You do no wrong ! " " Poor Moneo . You can not see that I have created a vehicle of in-justice . " Moneo could not speak . He realized that he had been diverted by a seeming return to mildness in the God Emperor . But now , Moneo sensed changes moving in that great body , and at this proximity . . . Moneo glanced around the crypt 's central chamber , reminding himself of the many deaths which had occurred here and which were enshrined here . Is it my time ? Leto spoke in a musing tone . " You can not succeed by taking hostages . That is a form of enslavement . One kind of human can not own another kind of human . This universe will not permit it . " The words lay there , simmering in Moneo 's awareness , a terrifying contrast to the rumblings of transformation which he sensed in his Lord . The Worm comes ! Again , Moneo glanced around the crypt chamber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too remote . " Well , Moneo , do you have any response ? " Leto asked . Moneo ventured a whisper : " The Lord 's words enlighten me . " " Enlighten ? You are not enlightened ! " Moneo spoke out of desperation . " But I serve my Lord ! " " You claim service to God ? " " Yes , Lord . " " Who created your religion , Moneo ? " " You did , Lord . " " That 's a sensible answer . " " Thank you , Lord . " " Do n't thank me ! Tell me what religious institutions perpetuate ! " Moneo backed away four steps . " Stand where you are ! " Leto ordered . Trembling all through his body , Moneo shook his head dumbly . At last , he had encountered the question without answer . Failure to answer would precipitate his death . He waited for it , head bowed . " Then I will tell you , poor servant , " Leto said . Moneo dared to hope . He lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the eyes were not glazed . . . and the hands were not trembling . Perhaps the Worm did not come . " Religious institutions perpetuate a mortal master-servant relationship , " Leto said . " They create an arena which attracts prideful human power-seekers with all of their nearsighted prejudices ! " Moneo could only nod . Was that a trembling in the God Em/peror 's hands ? Was the terrible face withdrawing slightly into its cowl ? " The secret revelations of infamy , that is what the Duncans ask after , " Leto said . " The Duncans have too much compassion for their fellows and too sharp a limit on fellowship . " Moneo had studied holos of Dune 's ancient sandworms , the giganticmouths full of crysknife teeth around consuming fire . He noted the tumescence of the latent rings on Leto 's tubular surface . Were they more prominent ? Would a new mouth open below that cowled face ? " The Duncans know in their hearts , " Leto said , " that I have deliberatelyignored the admonition of Mohammed and Moses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accusation . Moneo started to nod , then shook his head from side to side . He wondered if he dared renew his retreat . Moneo knew from experience that lectures in this tenor did not long continuewithout the coming of the Worm . " What might that admonition be ? " Leto asked . There was a mockinglightness in his voice . Moneo allowed himself a faint shrug . Abruptly , Leto 's voice filled the chamber with a rumbling baritone , an ancient voice which spoke across the centuries : " You are servants unto God , not servants unto servants ! " Moneo wrung his hands and cried out : " I serve you , Lord ! " " Moneo , Moneo , " Leto said , his voice low and resonant , " a millionwrongs can not give rise to one right . The right is known because it endures . " Moneo could only stand in trembling silence . " I had intended Hwi to mate with you , Moneo , " Leto said . " Now , it is too late . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that their meaning was out of any known context . Hwi ? Who was Hwi ? Oh , yes  --  the God Emperor 's Ixian bride-to-be . Mate . . . with me ? Moneo shook his head . Leto spoke with infinite sadness : " You , too , shall pass away . Will all your works be as dust forgotten ? " Without any warning , even as he spoke , Leto 's body convulsed in a thrashing roll which heaved him from the cart . The speed of it , the monstrous violence , threw him within centimeters of Moneo , who screamed and fled across the crypt . " Moneo ! " Leto 's call stopped the majordomo at the entrance to the lift . " The test , Moneo ! I will test Siona tomorrow ! "  |p296The  realization of what I am occurs in the timeless awareness which does not accumulate nor discard , which does not stimulate nor delude . I create a field without self or center , a field where even death becomes only analogy . I desire no results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires , no perfections nor even visions of achievements . In that field , omnipresent primal awareness is all . It is the light which pours through the windows of my universe.  --  The Stolen JournalsThe sun came up , sending its harsh glare across the dunes . Leto felt the sand beneath him as a soft caress . Only his human ears , hearingthe abrasive rasp of his heavy body , reported otherwise . It was a sensory conflict which he had learned to accept . He heard Siona walking behind him , a lightness in her tread , agentle spilling of sand as she climbed to his level atop a dune . The longer I endure , the more vulnerable I become , he thought . This thought often occurred to him these days when he went intohis desert . He peered upward . The sky was cloudless with a blue densitywhich the old days of Dune had never seen.  |p297What  was a desert without a cloudless sky ? Too bad it could not have Dune 's silvery hue . Ixian satellites controlled this sky , not always to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine-fantasy which faltered under human management . Still , the satellites held a sufficiently steady grip to give him this morning of desert stillness . He gave his human lungs a deep breath of it and listened for Siona 's approach . She had stopped . He knew she was admiring the view . Leto felt his imagination like a conjurer calling up everything which had produced the physical setting for this moment . He felt the satellites . Fine instruments which played the music for the dance of warming and cooling air masses , perpetually monitoring and adjustingthe powerful vertical and horizontal currents . It amused him to recall that the Ixians had thought he would use this exquisite machineryin a new kind of hydraulic despotism  --  withholding moisture from those who defied their ruler , punishing others with terrible storms . How surprised they had been to find themselves mistaken ! My controls are more subtle . Slowly , gently , he began to move , swimming on the sand surface , gliding down off the dune , never once looking back at the thin spire of his tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of daytime heat . Siona followed him with an uncharacteristic docility . Doubt had done its work . She had read the stolen journals . She had listened to the admonitions of her father . Now , she did not know what to think . " What is this test ? " she had asked Moneo . " What will he do ? " " It is never the same . " " How did he test you ? " " It will be different with you . I would only confuse you if I told you my experience . " Leto had listened secretly while Moneo prepared his daughter , dressing her in an authentic Fremen stillsuit with a dark robe over it , fitting the boot-pumps correctly . Moneo had not forgotten . Moneo had looked up from where he bent to adjust her boots . " The Worm will come . That is all I can tell you . You must find a way to live in the presence of the Worm . " He had stood then , explaining about the stillsuit , how it recycled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube from a catchpocketand suck on it , then reseal the tube . " You will be alone with him on the desert , " Moneo had said . " Shai-Hulud is never far away when you 're on the desert . " " What if I refuse to go ? " she asked . " You will go . . . but you may not return . "  |p298This  conversation had occurred in the ground-level chamber of the Little Citadel while Leto waited in the aerie . He had come down when he knew Siona was ready , drifting down in the predawn darknesson his cart 's suspensors . The cart had gone into the ground-level room after Moneo and Siona emerged . While Moneo marched across the flat ground to his ' thopter and left in a whispering of wings , Leto had required Siona to test the sealed portal of the ground-level chamber , then look upward at the tower 's impossible heights . " The only way out is across the Sareer , " he said . He led her away from the tower then , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , her curiosity and her doubts . Leto 's swimming progress took him down the dune 's slipface and onto an exposed section of the rocky basement complex , then up anothersandy face at a shallow angle , creating a path for Siona to follow . Fremen had called such compression tracks " God 's gift to the weary . " He moved slowly , giving Siona plenty of time in which to recognize that this was his domain , his natural habitat . He came out atop another dune and turned to watch her progress . She held to the track he had provided and stopped only when she reached the top . Her glance went once to his face then she turned a full circle to examine the horizon . He heard the sharp intake of her breath . Heat haze hid the spire 's top . The base might have been a distant outcropping . " This is how it was , " he said . There was something about the desert which spoke to the eternal soul of people who possessed Fremen blood , he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dune slightly higher than the others . " Take a good look at it , " he said , and he slipped down the dune 's other side to remove his bulk from her view . Siona took one more slow turn , looking outward . Leto knew the innermost sensation of what she saw . Except for that insignificant , blurred blip of his tower 's base , there was not the slightest lift of horizon  --  flat , everywhere flat . No plants , no living movement . From her vantage , there was a limit of approximately eight kilometers to the line where the planet 's curvature hid everythingbeyond . Leto spoke from where he had stopped , just below the dune 's crest . " This is the real Sareer . You only know it when you 're down here afoot . This is all that 's left of the bahr bela ma . " " The ocean without water , " she whispered . Again , she turned and examined the entire horizon . There was no wind and , Leto knew , without wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling the loss of all familiar reference points . She was abandoned in dangerous space . Leto glanced at the next dune . In that direction , they would come presently to a low line of hills which originally had been mountains but now were broken into remnant slag and rubble . He continued to rest quietly , letting the silence do his work for him . It was even pleasant to imagine that these dunes went on , as they once had , without end completely around the planet . But even these few dunes were degenerating . Without the original Coriolis storms of Dune , the Sareer saw nothing stronger than a stiff breeze and occasional heat vortices which had no more than local effect . One of these tiny " wind devils " danced across the middle distance to the south . Siona 's gaze followed its track . She spoke abruptly : " Do you have a personal religion ? " Leto took a moment composing his reply . It always astonished him how a desert provoked thoughts of religion . " You dare ask me if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no surface sign of the fears he knew she felt , Siona turned and stared down at him . Audacity was always an Atreides hallmark , he reminded himself . When she did n't answer , he said : " You are an Atreides for sure . " " Is that your answer ? " she asked . " What is it you really want to know , Siona ? " " What you believe ! " " Ho ! You ask after my faith . Well , now  --  I believe that something can not emerge from nothing without divine intervention . " His answer puzzled her . " How is that an . . . " " Natura non faci saltus , " he said . She shook her head , not understanding the ancient allusion which had sprung to his lips . Leto translated : " Nature makes no leaps . " " What language was that ? " she asked . " A language no longer spoken anywhere else in my universe . " " Why did you use it then ? " " To prod your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I just need to know why you brought me here . " " To give you a taste of your past . Come down here and climb onto my back . " She hesitated at first , then seeing the futility of defiance , slid down the dune and clambered onto his back . Leto waited until she was kneeling atop him . It was not the same as the old times he knew . She had no Maker hooks and could
