So it seemed at the tranquil Venice summit <P> His face was drawn and pale , and he could not even muster the energy to smile as he emerged from Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington last week . Jimmy Carter was physically exhausted from the rigors of his eight-day , 10,500-mile tour of Europe , and he was headed for a long weekend of rest at Camp David to prepare for a campaign swing through California this week . But just as clearly , he was also elated . The President was home from his ninth and probably his most successful summit with U.S. allies .
