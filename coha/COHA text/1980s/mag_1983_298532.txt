The censors turn on a former CIA director <P> As CIA director under Jimmy Carter , Admiral Stansfield Turner established the Publications Review Board , in essence a censorship committee within the agency to ensure that no secrets crept into print in the writings of former agents . It was Turner who was responsible for the civil prosecution of Frank W. Snepp , whose 1977 book , Decent Interval , a critical study of the agency 's role in Viet Nam , was published without prior CIA review , in violation of his contract with the agency . In February 1980 , the Supreme Court ordered Snepp to hand over profits from his book to the Government . So far , that ruling has cost Snepp nearly $200,000 in forgone royalties . <P> Now , ironically , Turner is running afoul of the review process he helped create . Agency censors want to delete material from Turner 's own book about intelligence gathering operations . They claim that Turner 's disclosures would endanger CIA sources and methods . <P> Turner , who has been highly critical of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he is digging in his heels to retain some anecdotes about CIA clandestine operations that he insists do not compromise U.S. security interests . The nature of the proposed deletions , he was quoted as saying , ' " changes the chapters and makes them less appealing from a sales point of view . " <P> He explains , " I believe it 's in the interest of an open society to make public as much information as you can , without endangering national security . " <P> That argument carries little weight in the Reagan Administration , which is appalled by too many leaks and has tightened rules on classification , making it easier for Government papers to be stamped SECRET . Last March the President issued a directive extending security procedures to all those in Government who are cleared for highly classified information . They now must sign prepublication review agreements covering their writings even after they have retired . Previously such strictures applied only to members of the intelligence Establishment like Snepp and Turner . <P> Turner says he is confident that the dispute can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will be his only course of action short of defying the agency as Snepp did . " If we did end up in court , it would surprise me , " he says . " This is a highly negotiated process . "
