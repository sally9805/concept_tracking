It is , of course , possible that Giordano 's Bakery , an 8-ft. by 10-ft. shop in a depopulated section of Newark , does not make the best Italian bread in the world . Possibly it is only the best in the New World . Possibly  --  and I say this to appease those of you in places like Cincinnati or Phoenix  --  possibly it is merely the best in New Jersey . But this is n't a position you would want to argue on Seventh Avenue , where the people hurrying between the shop and their double-parked cars tend to be staunch Giordano 's loyalists . <P> Would they have got out of their remote suburban beds on a raw Sunday morning if this bread were not truly special ? Has its moist , chewy middle not induced them to brave city streets where people have been mugged for their sneakers and murdered for a leather jacket ? Are the triple-braided loaves not caked with sesame seeds ? Does the round loaf not have a crust you can cut your gums on ? <P> " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " says a customer who has traveled to the ends of the earth , as far as Brick Town and Closter , N.J. , in search of the perfect Italian bread . " I like it for sandwiches . Especially with pepper and eggs . " Another customer says he 's been to Italy six times , but this bread is better . Giordano 's bread is the best , even when stale , says a woman in a mink-paw coat and a new Volvo . She likes to grind it up for stuffed artichokes . <P> But let us stop being coy . Is this not , above all , the bread that Frank Sinatra eats , having 50 loaves at a time shipped to his home near Palm Springs , Calif. ? It is . And while nobody on Seventh Avenue needs the Chairman of the Board to tell them what they can taste between their own two lips , still it is gratifying , like an endorsement from the Queen of England . On the wall over the cash register , Sinatra 's picture hangs next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patron . <P> At 5 on a Sunday morning , the bakers work in ankle-deep drifts of cornmeal , wielding wooden peel sticks to retrieve loaves six at a time from the back corners of the ovens . The crew is polyglot and pan-ethnic . Yolanda , a Puerto Rican , says she is a " born-again Italian . " When Carlos , who is tending the 260 loaves in the brick oven , is asked where he comes from , he looks blank . Johnnie-Mo , a bona fide Italian American who grew up around the corner , comes over to translate . He puts his face close , concentrates , then shouts , " Town ! In Peru ! Newark , Elizabeth , Kearny ! Your hometown ! " <P> " Ah , " says Carlos . " Lima . " <P> John Giordano and his son Steve are the other bona fiders . John 's father , who founded the bakery in 1913 , came over from Caserta , near Naples ( " like Belleville to Newark , a stone 's throw " ) . John now lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thick purple-tinted glasses , he sometimes wears a battered fedora , Jimmy Durante-style , and likes to share a lifetime of wisdom , usually prefaced by the phrase " You know what 's wrong with this country ? " <P> Steve meanwhile shuffles back and forth from the storage room to the mixer shouldering 100-lb. bags of flour . He adds some salt , a little yeast , a lot of water and nothing else . <P> " You put in sugar and shortening , " John comments , " and you 're pretty close to making cake , " which is , along with welfare , one of the big things wrong with this country : its daily bread can not stand up to butter .
