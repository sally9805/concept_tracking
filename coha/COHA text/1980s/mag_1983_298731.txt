With John Paul 's blessing , the Jesuits meet to elect a leader <P> Pope John Paul II has traveled tens of thousands of miles to interpret and preach the Gospel to the world 's 784 million Roman Catholics . But the short trip he took last Friday morning , to an imposing gray stone building just one block from St. Peter 's Square , rivaled many longer journeys in historic significance : for the first time in nearly 450 years , a Pope was paying an official visit to the headquarters of the Society of Jesus , the most powerful and prestigious of Catholic religious orders for men . By celebrating a Mass to open the Jesuits ' 33rd general congregation , which is meeting to elect a new superior general , John Paul was also making a conciliatory gesture to a spiritual organization , some of whose 26,000 members have been at odds with him on the proper role of the church , and the Jesuit order , in contemporary society . The Pope underscored these differences in his homily , quoting St. Paul : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocation . " <P> The gathering in Rome last week of 220 delegates from Jesuit provinces around the world may bring to an end two years of uncertainty over the order 's future . The underlying question : What kind of political role may Jesuits play while fighting for social justice ? The issue was raised , indirectly , in 1981 when the Pope overruled the wishes of the Jesuits ' ailing superior general , Father Pedro Arrupe , now 75 , who had designated Father Vincent O'Keefe , 63 , a former president of Fordham University , as his successor until elections could be held . Instead , John Paul appointed Father Paolo Dezza , now 81 , a philosopher and former rector of Rome 's Gregorian University , known for his traditional views on theological and social issues . That unprecedented intervention in the affairs of the society drew hundreds of letters of protest from Jesuits . It also made unmistakably clear the Pope 's unhappiness with certain trends within the order . <P> Addressing delegates to the congregation , John Paul last week reminded them of the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is an aspiration of all peoples . But this action must be exercised in conformity with your vocation as religious and priests , without confusing the tasks proper to priests with those that are proper to lay people . " Previously , the Pope had expressed his displeasure with some Jesuits who have openly challenged church teaching on such issues as birth control , the ordination of women and the celibacy of priests . <P> Under Arrupe , a charismatic Basque priest who was elected in 1965 as the 27th successor to the society 's 16th century founder , St. Ignatius of Loyola , Jesuits often took a direct role in politics . In 1967 , for example , Father Arrupe told American Jesuits that they could not remove themselves from the civil rights struggles then being waged . When Jesuit Activist Daniel Berrigan was in prison for his 1968 attempt to destroy U.S. Army draft records , Arrupe visited him , thereby giving tacit approval to Berrigan 's civil disobedience .
