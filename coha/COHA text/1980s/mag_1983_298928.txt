Falling revenues force Persian Gulf states to curb their spending <P> For most of the past decade , the money flowed like oil from the local gushers . All told , nearly $1 trillion poured into the sparsely populated , energy-rich Arab states along the Persian Gulf. * Now that stream has dwindled sharply . This year the region will take in only about $60 billion in oil revenues , down one-third from 1982 and only about one-half the level of two years ago . <P> Along with the fall in oil prices , the region 's economy has been hit hard by the three-year-old war of attrition between Iran and Iraq . That conflict could expand and seriously curtail oil shipments . Moreover , the two combatants sharply reduced their imports of Western goods . <P> Last year 's spectacular crash of the Souk al-Manakh , Kuwait 's unofficial stock market , has also had a depressing effect . More than $90 billion in debts was outstanding when the wildly speculative market collapsed . While the Kuwaiti government has moved to bail out small investors , losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrible shadow over business in the gulf , " notes one foreign observer . <P> All these troubles have plunged the gulf states into a unique recession . On the one hand , budgeted government spending , which fuels the economies of the area , has followed the path of energy earnings and taken a tumble . In Saudi Arabia ( pop . 9.7 million ) , the largest and most energy rich of the Arab gulf nations , officials have allocated $75.4 billion for the current fiscal year , down 17% from the previous period . But the region 's wealth remains so great that such cutbacks have not yet caused much hardship . " The gold rush is over , " says one U.S. diplomat stationed in the area . " But that does n't mean that there 's no gold out here . It just means that you ca n't pick up the nuggets on the street any more .

" That is unlikely to mean a steal , however , since the Girard Perregaux timepieces normally cost up to $6,000 . <P> Nevertheless , the decline is having an impact . In Qatar ( pop . 260,000 ) , government ministries have been asked to trim their payrolls by an average of 20% . In the United Arab Emirates ( pop . 790,000 ) , officials are considering a reduction of as much as 22% in state employment . That would mean a loss of some 10,000 positions . <P> Such public belt tightening has led to a new eagerness on the part of applicants for work in the private sector .
