" Guilty , " say the judges , but Tanaka refuses to step down <P> The trial had plodded on for so long that when the verdict finally arrived last week , the Japanese paid almost as much attention to it as they would have to the real Judgment Day . But then , the seven-year court battle did star Kakuei Tanaka , the former Prime Minister who still reigns as the country 's shrewdest powerbroker . As the dark blue Chrysler sedan wheeled Tanaka from his palatine compound on the fringes of Tokyo to the courthouse downtown , a swarm of 17 helicopters loaded with TV cameras and newsmen followed along overhead . Arriving at the Tokyo District Court , Tanaka faced a jostling battalion of some 1,500 reporters , photographers and television crews . He was caught in a sudden shower of camera flashes and responded by giving his customary wave , bringing his right hand smartly up to his forehead , and marching inside . The streets of Tokyo and other major cities emptied as people hurried to their homes and offices to hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours that presiding Judge Mitsunori Okada took to explain the ruling , a fidgety Tanaka gazed up at the ceiling , squinted down at his watch , folded and unfolded his ubiquitous paper fan . When Okada finally issued the verdict , Tanaka listened with his eyes closed . The three-judge panel found Tanaka guilty of having accepted $2 million in bribes from the Lockheed Corp . during the early 1970s in return for persuading Japan 's largest domestic airline , All Nippon Airways , to buy the company 's TriStar jets . He was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $2 million , the amount of the bribe. * At one particularly somber moment , Judge Okada looked directly at the former Prime Minister and sadly noted that his actions had brought " irreparable damage to the public trust in politics .

His lawyers immediately filed an appeal to the Tokyo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tanaka can still bring his case to the country 's Supreme Court . The entire appeals process could take ten years ; meanwhile , Tanaka , 65 , will remain free on bail . <P> Whether Tanaka will be forced to loosen his political hold on the country is another matter . Elected Prime Minister in 1972 , he resigned two years later when a Japanese magazine reported that he had set up a web of fake firms to hide shady financial dealings . Two years later , an official probe led to the Lockheed bribery charges and Tanaka 's subsequent arrest . Throughout his travails , however , Tanaka always retained his seat in the Diet , which he first won in 1947 . More important , he still controls the largest faction within Japan 's ruling Liberal Democratic Party ; of the 422 L.D.P. members in the 763-seat Diet , 119 consider Tanaka their leader . He has played a pivotal role in choosing his three successors , including the current Prime Minister , Yasuhiro Nakasone .
