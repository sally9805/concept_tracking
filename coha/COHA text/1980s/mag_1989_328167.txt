As darkness fell over Jerusalem 's Old City last Wednesday , Orthodox Jews recited evening prayers at the Western Wall , the remains of King Herod 's great temple and the symbol of the fall of Israel two millenniums ago . Armed border police stood guard against terrorists while 1,500 leaders of the Diaspora , more than half of them Americans , assembled for a " Conference on Jewish Solidarity with Israel . " Mordechai Gur , commander of the troops that wrested the Old City from Jordan in 1967 , read a closing proclamation : " We support the democratically elected government of national unity in its efforts to achieve peace and security with its neighbors .

" <P> Divisions among Israelis compound Shamir 's difficulties . At the start of the three-day meeting in Jerusalem , stories in Israeli newspapers described a new intelligence analysis contending that the intifadeh  --  the popular uprising by Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank  --  could not be suppressed by force . Only political measures , including talks with the P.L.O. , would lead to a solution .
