Oh , what a relief it was for the Cubs to finally obtain veteran reliever Rich " Goose " Gossage late Friday night . The Cubs hope Gossage can help them save face by saving games in the wake of the controversial Lee Smith trade in December . Smith , who saved a career- high 36 games for a last-place Cub team last year , is 30 . Gossage , who saved 11 games , is 36 . Following protracted negotiations with the San Diego Padres and Gossage ' s set-up man , agent Jerry Kapstein , the Cubs sent veteran third baseman/ outfielder Keith Moreland and young utility infielder Mike Brumley to San Diego for the once-intimidating Gossage and 26-year-old left-hander Ray Hayward . After hastily dispatching Smith , the club ' s all-time saves leader , to the Boston Red Sox for a pair of unproven pitchers-Calvin Schiraldi and Al Nipper- the Cubs were understandably apprehensive about their budding bullpen brigade . Even though Smith asked to be traded-largely because the Cubs refused to extend and renegotiate his $850 , 000 contract-the Cubs did not dangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been willing to part with a proven starter . " Schiraldi is now in our starting rotation . He says he would prefer to start , " said Cubs boss Jim Frey . " Now we go to spring training and everybody knows what their job is . I ' m glad we finally got the trade done . We added a guy ( Gossage ) in our bullpen who will give us stability . " Hayward was a No. 1 draft pick for the Padres ( 1983 ) . We ' ve been short on left-handers . Now we ' ve got Jamie Moyer , Frank DiPino , Drew Hall , Mike Mason and Hayward . What we have done is trade Smith , Moreland and Brumley and acquired four pitchers-Schiraldi , Nipper , Gossage and Hayward . " Padres manager Larry Bowa , Moreland ' s ex-teammate with the Phillies and Cubs , gave his stamp of approval to the trade . He plans to start Moreland in left field . " I think it ' s a good trade for both teams , " said Bowa . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone like him after losing Lee Smith . I wanted Moreland because he ' s a real gamer . He hits with men on base , and he gives us more versatility . " The Cubs caved in to some of Gossage ' s contract demands in terms of guaranteed salary for 1989 to win his approval of the deal . Gossage , who had a trade-veto clause in his contract , was in the final year of a five-year deal . He was guaranteed roughly $1 million this season . He also had an option year that would pay him $1. 5 million , but that option could have been bought out by the club for $300 , 000 . To waive the no-trade clause , Gossage reportedly sought a guaranteed salary for 1989 on par with his ' 88 pay . The Padres reportedly are planning to chip in the $300 , 000 to $400 , 000 they would have had to pay Gossage in 1989 for a buyout , thus putting his salary in excess of $1 million . The Cubs trust what ' s good for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lester Lancaster and Mason remain poised to take the ball in relief , just in case the Goose lays a golden egg . The Padres initially sought to acquire young left-hander Moyer . " I tried to protect our pitching staff because of the injuries and bad health of Scott Sanderson ( back ) , Jay Baller ( toxic poisoning ) , Bob Tewksbury ( shoulder ) and Mason ( elbow ) , " said Frey . Gossage , who broke into the big leagues with the White Sox in 1972 , was 5-4 with a 3. 12 earned-run average last season . He had only 11 saves while sharing late-inning duties with young Lance McCullers . Gossage , who led the American League in saves in 1975 with the Sox and in ' 78 with the Yankees , is second on the all-time saves list with 289 . He has a 106-93 career record with a 2. 88 ERA . Hayward , who has a history of control troubles , pitched for Triple-A Las Vegas of the Pacific Coast League in 1987 . He was 8-5 with a 3. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ' re going to miss Chicago . The ballclub gets so much national attention , " said Moreland , 33 . Moreland hit a career-high 27 homers with 88 RBIs last season , his first as a starting third baseman for the Cubs . He led the league with 28 errors but he said he became more comfortable at the position in the second half of the season . " I played hard in Chicago , but I can ' t cry over spilled milk , " said Moreland . " Life goes on . I was sure at the end of last season that I would be one of the guys who might be traded to improve the overall ballclub . " I have tons of memories of Chicago . I ' ll always remember the Ryne Sandberg game in 1984 ( when Sandberg went 5 for 7 and hit two late-inning home runs off Bruce Sutter of the Cardinals ) . " I ' ll also always remember that I hit a home run in my last Wrigley Field at-bat against the Cardinals , an inning before Andre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hit my 100th Cub career homer in my last at-bat of the season in Montreal . " As far as my biggest disappointment , it was the 1984 loss to the Padres in the playoffs . " The departure of Moreland leaves veteran Vance Law with the starting third-base job . Law , who played for Montreal last season , was signed as a free agent over the winter . Gossage , then 20 , started the 1972 season with the White Sox after just one full minor-league season , in which he posted an 18-2 record with a 1. 83 ERA and seven shutouts at Class A Appleton . Used mostly in middle relief , sometimes as a setup man for fellow 20-year-old Terry Forster , Gossage went 7-1 in 36 games for the ' 72 Sox . After two season of shuttling between Chicago and the minors , Gossage made it big in 1975 . He was 9-8 with a 1. 84 ERA and 26 saves , earned All-Star honors for the first time and was named American League Fireman of the Year by the Sporting News . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starter in 1976 , but with a last-place team that lost 97 games , the Colorado Springs native ended up 9-17 despite a respectable 3. 94 ERA . That winter , Sox owner Bill Veeck traded both Gossage and Forster to Pittsburgh for slugger Richie Zisk . CAPTION : PHOTO : AP Laserphoto .
