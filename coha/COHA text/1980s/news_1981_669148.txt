The preeminence of Paris as the world ' s style capital was in question ; the strength of Milan as a challenge to French leadership was palpable ; and the possibilities that may in time be offered by the British seemed tantalizing . But what was most startling was the constant , tangible evidence of the rising international importance of American fashion. // ' ' I so much want to come to New York , ' ' the editor of the Finnish Magazine , a Helsinki equivalent of Glamour , earnestly told an American reporter in Italy . ' ' I so much admire your Calvin Klein. ' ' // Members of the fashion press are bellwethers of the desirability of designer clothes . Some young correspondents for continental papers covered the showings dressed in Norma Kamali ' s sweat-shirt clothes . Looking over the audience at a Paris opening , a London editor observed , ' ' This place is wall-to-wall Ralph Lauren. ' ' // Wearables by Klein , Lauren , Kamali , Perry Ellis , and Willi Smith are all available overseas now , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their boutiques in fashionable quarters of the big cities. // The editor from Finland did not manage to come to New York , the final leg in the round of openings . But influential French , British , and Japanese writers , as well as representatives from other countries , converged on Manhattan to see where American fashion is heading. // On the whole , American designers did not disappoint them . Certain trends were repeated here . There was plenty of black and white , as well as stingingly bright combinations of vivid color . Separates dressing for all hours ( an American invention to begin with ) was emphasized. // The tendency to drop waists to the hipline was noticeable . Sleeve interest continued , with balloon , leg-o ' - mutton , and lantern among the inflated types , along with roomy batwings and dolmans . Beautiful , soft suede pieces were offered as covetable , if expensive , additions to spring wardrobes. // Very short and flippy circular culotte skirts , blousons , lingerie looks , and dizzying numbers of stripes on the rugby order were also common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did in Europe . Kasper used it in ways that were reminiscent of Hollywood ' s golden age ; Halston used it for Grecian drapery a la Mme. Gres. // But in the main , the reliance on Paris for direction - which for so long reflected lack of confidence and dearth of inspiration - seemed to have evaporated . New York designers did far fewer carbon copies of what their peers on the opposite side of the Atlantic are producing than has been the rule in earlier seasons. // Influences in the New York collections often stemmed from the American past , sometimes from the storybook romanticism of childhood - or the fashions were simply evolved from the needs of present-day lives. // Loose and flowy , American clothes for spring are not confined in spirit by any political or economic circumstances , as were the Paris offerings . The evening selection at Oscar de la Renta , whose collection this time had none of its usual Yves Saint Laurent overtones , is as rich as ever. // His dinner suits with blinding all-over beading and his moire-patterned satin chiffons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a recession ? ' ' clothes . His practical side was nonetheless in evidence. // Turnouts of thin black jersey with white handkerchief linen indicated he had been thinking in bread-and-butter terms - albeit the very best bread and the finest butter. // Elsewhere , clothes for the business executive were scarce . Some designers seemed to have forgotten about suits and dresses . Those who remembered showed both matched and unmatched textures and colors. // Geoffrey Beene , who has been doing roomy tops over full skirts or trousers all along , did not abandon the casual look that now prevails with his confreres here and overseas . He combined gingham ribbons ( they were often doubled around the hips ) with lace inserts , linens , and leafy silks or flowered sheer cottons - coming up with layered effects that have a modern yet romantic air. // Beene ' s most amusing contribution is his doubled dinner dress . Peel off the overdress , adjust the gingham sash belt around the hips , twist the sheer top-dress around the neck and knot it like a scarf ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed clothes in the middle of the party. // While lengths continue to be a matter of personal choice , Perry Ellis and Ralph Lauren are both advocates of long hems . Ellis ' s shapes are mostly skinny : the tunic-length sweater over the gently pleated skirt or pants , with a narrow belt marking the hipline , being characteristic . Summery fabrics ( there is much white ) add to an effect that has been compared to the early days of this century , when women began to engage in sports . The wide stripes the designer calls his ' ' croquet stripes ' ' and the mallets models carried helped put the point across . Lauren ' s storybook collection , with its ankle-length linen prairie skirts over eyelet petticoats , and its Victorian blouses , is a delectable warm-weather continuation of the Southwestern dressing he popularized for this fall and winter. // Gathered culottes , bermudas , and other different-looking trousers ( including rompers ) are still much in the picture for next season . Now that New York fashion has finally bolstered its courage and broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nerve to wear the its creations . In which case , such European remarks as ' ' You can alway tell the Americans , they are the ones in the skirts ' ' will no longer be overheard. // //
