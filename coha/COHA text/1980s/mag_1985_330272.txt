The superb Andre Kertesz exhibition currently on view at the Art Institute of Chicago is that rare thing , an art world vindication that the artist is around to enjoy . When Kertesz arrived in the U.S. in 1936 , he was 42 . He had behind him a celebrated body of work in photography . During eleven years in France , and before that in his native Hungary , he had perfected one of the camera 's fundamental charms , its ability to fix those brief entanglements of form and event that escape the eye . Netting perishable moments in a deft geometry , he practiced photography as an art of sublime attention . <P> The offer of a photo-agency contract coaxed him to the U.S. , but his work went unappreciated . It was subtle and delicate ; photo editors who wanted easy- to-read pictures were unmoved . In Paris he had been one of the pioneers of photojournalism . In New York City , where the hustle and grind made him shudder , he turned to routine assignments , flattering swank living rooms for House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Museum of Modern Art mounted a retrospective of his work , that his rehabilitation got under way . In recent years , through books and smaller exhibits , his stock has risen further . The Chicago show , which travels in December to New York City 's Metropolitan Museum of Art , caps the long effort to re store his fame . Today , at 90 , Kertesz still aims a zoom lens from the balcony of his Manhattan apartment , and he was in Chicago to be toasted at his exhibition 's opening . <P> The Paris of Kertesz 's early career was the cockpit of modernism , where surrealists , Dadaists and constructivists fanned the air with their manifestos . Kertesz felt the breeze but sailed his own course . He absorbed the lessons of constructivism , without becoming an arctic formalist . His fellow Hungarian expatriate Laszlo Moholy-Nagy could turn people into compositional load bearers upholding a grand design . Kertesz linked his formal sense to benign temperament . Joining elegant compositions to gentle human anecdotes , he achieved a formalism with the juice still flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of surrealism beyond the titillations of the absurd . In Homing Ship , taken eight years after he left Paris , he let a walking sailboat ( actually a toy that obscures part of the man carrying it ) and an inverted tree ( a reflection in a puddle ) speak for the yearnings of his own exile . It is a lovely image , unlikely and tender . It also typifies his knack for keeping sentimentality at bay in even the most tempting circumstances . His pictures are sweet-tempered but never pat , heartfelt but not tearstained , legible but rarely obvious . <P> Sidestepping the familiar monuments of Paris , Kertesz sought candid bits of street life , preferably from a high vantage point , where he could inspect the world without engaging it . He had a geometer 's orientation : in many of his best shots , people are distant figures , elegantly distributed among the grids and arcs of the city . The Paris that issued from his camera was not the serene city of Atget , immemorial and mostly unpeopled . Neither was it Brassai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kertesz 's Paris was like the woman in his picture Satiric Dancer : pert , ironic and caught at a fresh tilt .
