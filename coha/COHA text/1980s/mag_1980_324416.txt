Rothschild 's divided house <P> No sign marks the headquarters of N.M . Rothschild &; Sons Ltd. in London 's financial district-only a shield with five red arrows , symbolizing the five sons of the dynasty 's founder . The House of Rothschild , which once helped British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli buy the Suez Canal , needs no identification . Last week sixth-generation members of one of Europe 's oldest and wealthiest families were fighting over the use of their name . Evelyn de Rothschild , 49 , chairman of the 176-year-old N.M . Rothschild bank , forced his cousin Jacob , 44 , to stop using the family name on the Rothschild Investment Trust , which Jacob has run for ten years . <P> The disagreement was largely a matter of style . Discreet and conservative in its ways , the Rothschild bank is the epitome of bowler hat British banking . The Rothschild trust , known as RIT for short , is something of a swinger in world financial circles . Under Jacob 's management , its assets have increased astronomically , from $14.3 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galleries and auction houses , among others . <P> Disapproving of his cousin 's business ways , Evelyn two weeks ago resigned from the board of the Rothschild Investment Trust and invoked a ten-year-old agreement that would force RIT to drop the family 's name . Says Evelyn : " I do n't want to sound staid and toffee nosed , but in the banking business , a name is terribly important . " <P> Jacob also knows what 's in a name . He proposed calling his operation the J. Rothschild Investment Trust in order to distinguish it from the N.M . Rothschild bank , but Evelyn turned down that suggestion . Finally Jacob capitulated . Saying that he was sad that the " difference of opinion within the family " had become public , he resigned as a director of N.M . Rothschild and agreed to change his firm 's name to RIT Ltd . However , he has put management of its assets into another organization called J. Rothschild and Co. , meaning he will continue to display the family label .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
