 | New Yorkers pride themselves on coping with crisis , so when a strike halted the city 's giant subway and bus system last week , nearly 5 million commuters simply found other ways to get to work . They walked . They jogged . They roller-skated . They rode bicycles , unicycles , motorized skateboards ? even shopping carts . They trotted out horses , hired helicopters , carpooled with strangers and hitchhiked six to a car . A flotilla of chartered ferryboats , fishing boats , yachts , seaplanes and dinghies carried battalions of lawyers and stockbrokers to Wall Street . All around town , an air of festive determination prevailed as New Yorkers resigned themselves to what could be a long strike . " I 've been up since 4 a.m. and I wo n't get home for fourteen hours , " said one footsore businessman trudging to work across the Brooklyn Bridge . " But this is one of the things you put up with when you live in New York . " What could easily have turned into chaos became only an inconvenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the week , schools were closed for spring recess and many people were on vacation for the Passover and Easter holidays . A simultaneous strike against the Long Island Rail Road was settled quickly , easing the bumper-tobumper rush-hour crush . But there was plenty of individual hardship , particularly for people who live in the outer boroughs . Scores of people turned up at city emergency rooms complaining of chest pains , sprained ankles and blisters . An elderly man named Henry Steinberg walked across the Brooklyn Bridge , put in a full day as Wall Street messenger , then started to walk back home . Midway across the bridge , he suffered a fatal heart attack . The big loser was the city itself . New York businesses lost an estimated $100 million a day in sales , wages and production . Restaurants reported business down about 25 per cent , sales at Fifth Avenue department stores dropped 30 per cent ? and many closed early . Daily tax revenues were off $2 million , and the financially strapped city paid out another $500,000 a day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , determined not to give in , threatened to sue the transit union to recover the direct losses . Hardest hit was the city 's bustling garment industry , with thousands of low-income workers stranded in outlying neighborhoods . " Production is at a standstill , " lamented Leon Kaljian of International Pleating ? and it could not have come at a worse time . This week , nearly 1,000 buvers from all over the world are scheduled to converge on Seventh Avenue to view the fall fashions . With $2 billion in sales at stake and most city hotel rooms booked indefinitely , garment makers scrambled to find housing for visiting buyers . Rickshaw : But one man 's misfortune was another man 's bonanza . Sales of running shoes soared . Bike rentals boomed , and some stores hiked the price for a daylong rental from $7 to $25 ? plus a $150 cash deposit . For roller-skate rentals , the going rate was $10 a day ? and one entrepreneur even offered a free " safety patrol " escort for shaky novices . Hearty George Fox , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bicycle tires , old carpeting , an antique chair and a hockey stick , then ferried passengers for " half a buck a block . " A couple of days later , his rickshaw was stolen from its midtown parking place . Many firms drew up elaborate contingency plans to transport or house their employees . American Express Co. , which spent $200,000 , was among the most ambitious . In addition to operating a Brooklynto-Manhattan ferryboat , reserving 300 hotel rooms , chartering 50 buses and renting 100 bikes , it converted two floors of its downtown headquarters into men 's and women 's dormitories ? complete with cots , color TV 's , game boards and showers . Most NEWSWEEK/APRIL 14 , 1980 @#  | of the 400 employees who slept over were needed to service the toll-free emergency number , a spokesman explained . Most New Yorkers , however , were left to their own , often ingenious , devices . One man attached wheels to a pair of crosscountry skis and glided through Central Park . Others discovered that a straight line was not always the shortest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading into Manhattan , some Queens residents drove to New Jersey and took the stilloperating Port Authority Trans-Hudson subway back into the city . But for most New Yorkers , walking was quickest ? and hikes of 5 miles were common . Everywhere , New Yorkers opened their homes , their office sofas and their cars to each other . Hitchhiking , normally a rarity in New York , was suddenly in vogue . Three lucky Manhattan women hopped a ride in a chauffeured , fawn-colored Rolls-Royce . The police , ordered to halt all vehicles carrying fewer than two people south of 96th Street in the morning rush , set up impromptu dispatch services , matching stray pedestrians with cars needing riders . " Hey , Eddie , I need one to 50th Street , " shouted one policeman to another . Elsewhere , Chemical Bank branches served free orange juice from sidewalk stands to pedestrians passing by . On the Upper West Side , a Hispanic man offered papaya juice . Standoff : As the strike enters its second week , the generally good mood could quickly sour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . John Lawe , president of the 34,000-member Transit Workers Union local , initially had demanded an immediate 30 per cent wage hike in a two-year contract , plus quarterly cost-of-living increases . ( A motorman now makes about $18,000 a year . ) Negotiators for the state 's Metropolitan Transportation Authority , already staggering under a $250 million budget deficit , said they simply did n't have the money ? and they were backed by Mayor Koch , who did not want a generous settlement to set a psychological precedent for city unions . MTA chairman Richard Ravitch offered 6 per cent hikes in each of the two years , and insisted on stricter work rules to increase productivity and the right to cut overtime costs by hiring part-time workers . As the clock ran out , Ravitch agreed to consider a mediator 's proposal of two annual 8 per cent wage boosts , but the union 's board balked and Lawe called the strike . Strikes by public employees are illegal under New York State 's Taylor Law , and Lawe demanded amnesty from penalties that include docking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail terms for union leaders and loss of the right to deduct union dues from paychecks . Backed by city and state officials , the MTA said amnesty was out of the question and hardened its position on the work rules . Lawe , in turn , pressed for still higher wages . MTA officials fretted that each additional percentage point in the wage agreement would mean a $10 million boost in the transit system 's annual budget . Whatever the final settlement , New Yorkers are sure of one thing : the 50 cent fare will go up right away , perhaps to as much as 75 cents .
