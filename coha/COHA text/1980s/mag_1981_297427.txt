THE CARE OF TIME by Eric Ambler Farrar Straus Giroux 277 pages ; $11.95 <P> After 45 years in thriller country , Eric Ambler is still the master of murk . Ironic , cerebral , smooth as vintage port , he has created an all-too-familiar world of doublecross and blackmail where the heroes are unheroic and the villains almost likable . The Care of Time is quintessential Ambler from the very first sentence : " The warning message arrived on Monday , the bomb itself on Wednesday . It became a busy week . " <P> A bit of an understatement . The bomb , a very sophisticated one , is intended to persuade its recipient , Freelance Writer Robert Halliday , that the sender is a man to be taken seriously . Next , through devious channels , follows a more attractive package : an offer to the writer to edit " a definitive work on the nature of terrorism " - based on the newly discovered journals of a 19th century anarchist named Sergei Gennadiyevich Nechayev . Halliday 's fee : $50,000 . Such jack being rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It leads him to Italy and to the mailer of the bomb , an unsavory entrepreneur of many aliases-Zander , Brochet , Hecht , Luccio-all of which , in various languages , mean pike , the fish . <P> The deal turns out to be as fishy as the dealer . Instead of penciling a manuscript-there is no manuscript-Halliday finds himself enmeshed in devious negotiations initiated by a Persian Gulf emir identified only as the Ruler . The potentate is eager to lease territory he controls to NATO as a major allied military base . Zander-Luccio , the Pike , serves as middleman in the deal , hoping that a grateful U.S. Government will thereafter provide him with political asylum and a new identity . After a long career of nastiness in the Middle East , he has learned that he is the target of an international hit gang named Muk h abarat Zentrum ( secret intelligence service ) , code-named Rasmuk . There is also a contract out on his seductive girl Friday , who turns out to be his daughter and another reason why Halliday stays around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The author , who has also been one of the most felicitous movie scenarists of his generation ( A Night to Remember , The Cruel Sea ) , may have developed his unerring tempo from that medium . His labyrinthine plots , however , are uniquely Amblerian . Hero Halliday , who is forced into acting as intermediary between the Ruler , the Pike and NATO intelligence , finally meets the sheik in a house above an abandoned silver mine in Austria . Though the mine is supposed to be a potential treatment center for respiratory diseases , Halliday discovers that the potentate has far more sinister intentions . What follows thereafter is a frenetic and wholly plausible chase , with enough twists and alarms to fuel two more novels .
