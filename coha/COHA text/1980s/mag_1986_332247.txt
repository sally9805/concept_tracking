Just 25 days before Adolf Hitler committed suicide in Berlin , U.S. Army Private Wil bert Massman entered Munich with the 179th Infantry Regiment and settled into a small apartment on the city 's east side , using it as an office . While rummaging through a bookcase , Massman stumbled on a red leather album embossed with a swastika . Flipping through the album , he saw 72 photos of World War I scenes , four of which showed a man who appeared to be the young Adolf Hitler . Other items , bearing the monogram A.H. , convinced Massman that the apartment had once been Hitler 's . Massman sent the memorabilia home to Chicago with a note telling his wife to remove the pictures and use the book for photos of their newborn daughter .

Donley contacted United Press International , which set out to authenticate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing  --  maybe . After the memorable Hitler- diary hoax of three years ago , few experts were eager to put their reputations on the line once more .
