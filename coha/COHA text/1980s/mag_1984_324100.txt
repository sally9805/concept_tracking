Unveiling a newborn fighter <P> At Grumman Aerospace Corp . ' s test-flight complex on Long Island , a band struck up The Stars and Stripes Forever . Then , as 1,500 employees and dignitaries applauded , the curtain rose on the X-29A , the experimental plane that the Air Force hopes will spawn a new generation of fighters . " That 's a beautiful model , " said Vice President George Bush , on hand to honor the new plane , " but they 've got the wings on backward . " <P> No , the wings are on right ; they are supposed to sweep forward . They are mounted at the tail end and pitched ahead at a 35 angle . The configuration increases lift , reduces drag , prevents stall outs , and allows the X-29A to turn on a dime at supersonic speeds . Just behind the cockpit are gill-like projections called canards , the French word for ducks . Indeed , the plane resembles a mallard in full flight . <P> During World War II , the Germans built an experimental Junkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plane flew well in tests . But once the sound barrier was broken in 1947 , the design presented a problem : forward-swept wings tore away from the fuselage at supersonic speeds , and strengthening the wings with steel or aluminum made the craft unacceptably heavy . Now , newly developed graphite-epoxy composites can produce a wing stronger than steel and up to 45% lighter . These materials form the skin of the X-29A 's wings . <P> But the unique design makes the X-29A as skittish as a colt . " It 's roughly like throwing an arrow backward , " says Robert Roemer , head of the X-29A project for Grumman . " No human could handle the multitude of adjustments necessary to keep this bird in stable flight . " So three computers do the work for the pilot , making 40 adjustments a second to the wings and canards to keep the plane from ripping apart . In effect , the pilot guides he plane by feeding directions into the computer . If all the computers were to fail , the X-29A would self destruct in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance last week at the X-29A 's roll-out underscores the Pentagon 's interest in high-tech fighters and the Administration 's desire to publicize its military buildup in an election year . If successful , the plane , which will serve as a laboratory for new systems , will become a blueprint for fighter jets of the future . Says Robert Cooper , director of the Pentagon 's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency : " We decided we had to return to the days when we were willing to take major risks to make spectacular advances .
