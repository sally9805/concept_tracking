A lawsuit that turns tables <P> For more than a decade outraged environmentalists have marched countless companies into court on charges that they are polluting nature . But a corporation has turned the tables and sued the environmentalists for libel . One year ago , Rick Webb , 31 , coordinator of West Virginia Mountain Stream Monitors Project , an environmental group , charged in his sporadically produced newsletter that the strip-mine operation of the D.L.M. Coal Corp . of Buckhannon , W. Va. , had " destroyed " seven miles of trout streams on the Buckhannon River as a result of sulfuric acid and iron poisoning . Webb 's complaint helped result in a federal inspection and a pollution study of land near the mines by the Environmental Protection Agency . <P> Though firms normally are reluctant to challenge such allegations in court because the cases can result in bad publicity , D.L.M. decided to fight . Last month it filed a $200,000 libel suit charging that Webb 's account was " totally false and untrue , defamatory and libelous , intentionally and maliciously published . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying , " It has spotlighted the problem better than we ever could have done . " Some businessmen , though , feel that the case will have a sobering effect on environmental activists .
