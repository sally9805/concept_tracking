When Pierre Samuel du Pont IV told his father that he wanted to go to law school , Pierre Samuel du Pont III was baffled . Du Ponts , after all , did not become lawyers , they hired them . Twelve years later , after du Pont had finished law school and fulfilled his filial obligation by working in the family business  --  the country 's largest chemical company  --  he went back to his father . He was restless : one of his more memorable company tasks was assessing whether du Pont should manufacture peanut butter and jelly in an aerosol can . He wanted to try his hand at politics . " I was on track to become a senior executive at 63 , and I was only 30 , " explains du Pont . <P> Twenty years later , Pete du Pont 's ambitions are again being met with incredulity . Surely , when the former Republican Governor of Delaware called a press conference last September in the Hotel du Pont and announced that he was running for President , he had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plebeian Kansas roots with the preppie background of the front runner , George Bush , a du Pont of Delaware has n't got a chance . What skeptics do not understand is that , in his own mind , Pete du Pont is a self-made man , one who rebelled against his family tradition by going to law school and then into politics . <P> Du Pont , 52 , insists that his heavyweight name has no real bearing on his campaign . It is an irresistible angle for journalists , he admits , and the patrician roman numeral provides an easy stereotype . Du Pont is astute enough to ban reporters from his elegant home near Wilmington and his sprawling summer house in Maine , but he knows he can not really bury his privileged background . " I am what I am . I ca n't change it , so I do n't worry about it . " <P> In a political climate in which most candidates are searching their souls for a persona that voters can trust , du Pont stands apart . He considers the obsession with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing personal anecdotes slightly silly . To his closest aides , du Pont 's unapologetic approach is not mysterious . " He does n't need this , " says his longtime aide Glenn Kenton , campaign chairman . " He knows he could do a good job as President , but he can live without it . " <P> Pete du Pont hopes to distinguish himself as an iconoclast , a free-market conservative boldly willing to question sacrosanct social programs that his better-known rivals fear to address . He wants his ideas to speak for themselves , and loudly enough to drown out the murmurs about his patrimony . He has selected five issues that he believes can excite the electorate . It took the methodical du Pont two years to research and hone his message , and he has now compressed it neatly onto a single 3-in. by 5-in. card that he keeps in his breast pocket . Dispensing with the usual homilies about preserving the family farm , du Pont brashly advocates abolishing farm subsidies within five years . Worried about the cost of the baby boom 's retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after IRA accounts . To make public schools more competitive , he wants parents to be able to enroll their children anywhere , regardless of district lines . He also advocates testing students for drugs . He particularly wants to replace welfare with a mandatory jobs program . He calls these proposals " damn right " issues because when stated simply , they make the average voter say just that .
