While unemployment continues to hover around 7. 4 percent nationally , and is much higher among inner-city youths and members of minorities , the biggest challenge facing employers in the booming suburbs northeast of Atlanta is finding people to fill jobs. // Like other pockets of prosperity around the country , from New York City and the suburbs of Washington to Dallas and Phoenix , job openings here for sales people , clerks , secretaries and counter workers in fast-food restaurants are going begging this fall . Many merchants fear the situation may worsen in the Christmas season. // Many economists and others agree that the difficulties some employers face in filling these jobs also underscore the wide local and regional disparities in the economy. // On the one hand , more than 8. 5 million workers remain unemployed despite 22 months of economic recovery . Many manufacturing industries have had to cut their payrolls because of automation and retrenchment in the face of foreign competition . <> <> Growth in Service Jobs // On the other hand , even in communities where there are still large pools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rate faster than they can be filled . This is especially true in the service sector of the economy , where growth has been strongest. // In New York City , labor officials complain of shortages of clerical workers and sales people . On Long Island , where unemployment last month dropped to a 10-year low of 4. 9 percent , fast-food , sales and office jobs are going begging . The situation in the New York area became apparent in the summer , when , experts said , the economy in the suburbs was spinning off so many jobs that some employers could not find enough seasonal workers. // The largest number of jobs going unfilled are unskilled or semiskilled jobs and entry-level positions , which pay at or just above the Federal minimum wage of $3. 35 an hour . An undetermined number are part-time jobs . <> <> Growth in Suburbs // Labor analysts say the current market for these jobs reflects a variety of factors , not the least of which is the geography of most urban areas . Much of the new growth and prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being carried farther and farther away from those economically disadvantaged core-city residents who continue to swell unemployment rolls. // Unemployment among blacks nationally is already twice that of whites , and nearly half of all black teen-agers are without work. // " It isn ' t economically reasonable for a person who is going to work for the minimum wage on a job that is not full time to drive 15 to 20 miles each way to get to the job , " said Dan Anderson , of the Arizona Department of Economic Security in Phoenix , where unemployment has dropped to 3. 2 percent . " And a lot of people who potentially are candidates for these types of jobs don ' t have transporation. " // Janet L. Norwood , commissioner of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics , said many jobs going unfilled were the kinds that " a lot of people just don ' t want to take. " // Part of the problem is a structural change that occurred in the labor markets as a result of the recession , which claimed its greatest toll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are opening in service areas such as restaurants and retail stores , a laid-off worker who made $10 or $12 an hour making shoes or apparel will probably have little interest in a fast-food job that pays less than half that . <> <> Transportation a Factor // Employment officials in several cities complained that their situation was worsened by inadequate public transportation to carry workers to jobs. // " The biggest problem we face is finding ways for economically disadvantaged people from the core city to get to the suburbs , where the openings are , " said Wynn Montgomery , head of Atlanta ' s Private Industry Council . " We are actually able to develop more jobs than we can fill. " // Gwinnett County , where Atlanta area employers are having the most difficulty filling jobs , is not more than 20 miles from downtown . City bus lines do not travel there. // In California , analysts from the state ' s Employment Development Department said fast-food outlets and some retail merchants were having some problems filling jobs in Orange County , where the unemployment rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another factor is demographics . In the 1970 ' s , 300 , 000 teen-agers entered the work force each year . Last year only 150 , 000 teen-agers , the group most likely to take entry-level jobs , entered the labor market , a reflection of falling birth rates. // The drive to find employees to fill jobs has been most aggressive in those cities where the jobless rate is already low . In Atlanta , for example , it is under 5 percent , and it is just over 3 percent in Dallas , Phoenix and Raleigh , N.C. In those areas , competition for labor has driven wage rates up and resulted in employers ' taking innovative approaches to recruit workers . <> <> Bonus for New Workers // Wendy ' s restaurant here in Gwinnett County , where the population has grown 131 percent from 1970 to 1980 , is offering employees a $50 cash bonus for every worker they recruit who stays on the job more than 30 days. // In Framingham , Mass. , one of the state ' s fastest-growing urban areas , employers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring in workers from Athol , an economically depressed mill town 70 miles to the northeast. // Retail merchants in Framingham , which has an unemployment rate of 2. 3 percent , went to the state for help when they could not find 1 , 000 workers they needed for November and December. // The situation facing employers looking for laborers is " horrendous , " said Douglas A. Bryant , president of a hotel and restaurant chain in Raleigh . " I could use 45 to 60 new people tomorrow , " he said. // One related phenomenom noted by labor analysts is the growth of companies that supply part-time workers . As of July , more than 636 , 000 people were employed as temporaries , 32 percent more than the previous year . <> <> More Temporary Workers Hired // Harvey Hamel , an analyst with the Bureau of Labor Statistics , said the increase in the temporary market reflected in part the fact that businesses were having more difficulty finding steady , full-time employees. // William B. Guillion , manager of Gwinnett Place , a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must use temporary employment services to fill out his cleaning crew. // Among other things , Mr. Guillon said he had approached Atlanta area religious agencies that provide resettlement assistance for Asian immigrants in an attempt to find workers. // Mr. Guillon said the shortages of workers in the Atlanta suburbs were forcing employers to become more aggressive and innovative in the way they look for labor. // In the area around Raleigh and Durham , where the emergence of high-technology industries and rapid growth have cut unemployment rates to nearly 3 percent , local fast-food restaruants are running help-wanted advertisments on the radio and offering starting wages 30 cents an hour above the Federal minimum wage. // //
