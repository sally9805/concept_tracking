THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY <P> Bob Hoskins is a galvanically repellent actor . Hoskins ( seen on PBS in BBC 's Pennies from Heaven and Othello ) has a torpedo-shaped head attached to a bulldog 's body . He moves , and barks out his dialogue , with the arrogant energy of Cagney and Robinson , but with precisely none of their charm . In The Long Good Friday , Hoskins gets to play a Little Hitler of the London underworld out to make a killing in real estate while some mysterious rivals make more spectacular killings of his henchmen . Director John Mackenzie 's idea of subtle menace is to show a victim 's hand nailed to the floor ; and Hoskins , in moments of stress , is too quick to bare his lower teeth and gnar . Even then , he is oddly entertaining to watch-rather like a vole making a predatory lunge and landing in a coyote 's open mouth . <P> <P> WRONG IS RIGHT <P> What is it about TV news that makes otherwise cogent screenwriters go bananas ? Paddy Chayefsky lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now Richard Brooks ( Elmer Gantry , In Cold Blood ) heaves a harangue about world politics and the media , and it is one desperate muddle . Sean Connery plays a superstar reporter who bears messages not only to millions of viewers but , Haiglike , from heads of state to thugs of war . The fate of the world hangs in the balance . What does not balance is Brooks ' Strangelovian mix of comic terror and terrorist comedy . Give him points for honest outrage , and comfort him with polls showing that while most Americans get most of their news from TV , they pay blessed little attention to it . <P> <P> A LITTLE SEX <P> You thought the notion of New York as Fun City died with the Lindsay administration ? No such thing . In A Little Sex , Manhattan is still where a coupla crazy kids can get their Wasp jollies while jogging through Central Park , skateboarding past the Chrysler Building and making love in an apartment the size of the Metropolitan Museum 's Egyptian wing . He ( Tim Matheson ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kate Capshaw , whose resemblance to both Julie Christie and Diane Keaton makes her odds-on favorite as Warren Beatty 's next costar ) teaches at a girls ' private school . They get married . His eye still wanders . Her eyes narrow . It has all been said before , most eloquently by Irwin Shaw in his 1939 story " The Girls in Their Summer Dresses . " Writer Robert De Laurentis and Director Bruce Paltrow have no such ambitions ; instead they have made an R-rated sitcom . Early on , our hero is advised that " even bad sex is good . " Maybe , but A Little Sex isn't.
