Call it the summit of good feelings . As the leaders of the seven major industrial democracies concluded their twelfth annual economic conference in Tokyo last week , their assessments of the meeting went beyond the typical rote claims of harmony . Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone declared that the conference " reaffirmed mutual understanding and trust between us . " British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher uttered a hearty " mission accomplished . " Even that perennial summit spoilsport , French President Francois Mitterrand , exulted that the meeting was " the most relaxed " he had experienced . Said the most triumphant of the summiteers , Ronald Reagan : " It 's no exaggeration to describe the Tokyo summit as the most successful of the six that I have attended . " <P> While the meeting yielded up no declarations that will be remembered for their ringing prose , it did produce two carefully wrought but unusually direct communiques , one condemning state-sponsored terrorism , another supporting a plan to stabilize currency-rate fluctuations . The statements represented personal victories for two members of the Reagan Cabinet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes lonely struggle to develop a consensus in the U.S. and among America 's allies on the need to strike back against states that sponsor terrorism ; Tripoli and Tokyo are proof that he has succeeded . Treasury Secretary James Baker , with the pragmatic shrewdness of a Texas pol , has been stroking and cajoling his fellow finance ministers in hopes of finding better ways to manage world trade and finance policies ; after cagily downplaying the chance of significant agreements , he came away from Tokyo with a plan for guiding the international economy . <P> The summit started with a bang . During a series of welcoming ceremonies for the leaders ( from the U.S. , Britain , France , West Germany , Japan , Italy and Canada ) at Akasaka Palace , five homemade missiles fired from crude tubes in an apartment window nearby sailed over their target and fell harmlessly to earth . The summiteers were hardly fazed . When asked if he was disturbed by the rockets , Reagan quipped , " No , they missed . " <P> The radicals ' salvo may even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain immediacy to his call for a tough declaration against terrorism . During dinner with his fellow leaders on the first night of the summit , Reagan distributed a rambling ten-page position paper that Shultz , White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan and National Security Adviser John Poindexter had hurriedly drafted during the Air Force One flight . Thatcher , much to everyone 's surprise , then pulled out a two-page proposal of her own . It included a checklist of direct measures that the allies could undertake . <P> While the summiteers slept , their aides ( known as Sherpas ) toiled until 4:30 a.m. on a statement . Copies were waiting for the leaders at their Monday conference . A Thatcher aide had scribbled on the British Prime Minister 's copy : " P.M. : Report on the Sherpas ' efforts . It 's pretty weak . " The Iron Lady emphatically agreed . Leaning toward her microphone , she declared , " I still do n't think this is strong enough . It does n't reflect our discussion last night . " Reagan , happy to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as did Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
