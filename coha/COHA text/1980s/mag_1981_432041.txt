 | The crowd at the Indianapolis airport spilled far down the corridor . The Concalli High School band played " Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree , " while a junior-high contingent gave a cacophonous cheer of " Freedom . . . Freedom . " They might have been welcoming the state basketball champions . But they were gathered to honor a 34-year-old embassy communications officer named Frederick Kupke , who had been unknown when he was taken hostage and held virtually incommunicado in the fourteen months since . A weary Kupke walked off the plane and into the arms of Gov . Robert D. Orr , who designated him a Sagamore of the Wabash , Indiana 's highest civilian honor . " I do n't think the Ayatollah Khomeini would understand this at all , " Orr told the cheering crowd . " But Hoosiers do . " The plane carrying William Royer Jr . back to Houston swooped low over the control tower before landing , to give him a view of the huge yellow ribbon that had been wrapped around it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a gift from Astrodome magnate Roy Hofheinz and his friends . " Texas hospitality is legendary , " Royer told the crowd gathered in his honor . " This outpouring of love is overwhelming . " He was carried off in a caravan to his mother 's house in West University Place , where ? under the blinking welcome of the Goodyear blimp ? the 49-year-old teacher untied the yellow ribbon that had flown for months beside the front door . He waved one last time to the crowd , and the door closed behind him . It seemed to be the most eagerly awaited return since Odysseus was held captive by the Cyclops , and not even he got a lifetime pass to the Milwaukee Brewers . After fourteen months of silence , the hostages were engulfed in noise ? a thunder of adulation rolling across the nation , a mighty sound of mingled cheers and speeches , motorcade sirens and the strains of " America the Beautiful " overlaid with the sentimental " Tie a Yellow Ribbon " that became the anthem of their return . After fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they looked : tied around the nose of a DC-9 , on 5 miles of telephone poles along Interstate 74 in Illinois , on the police dogs that kept reporters away from them in Washington , wrapped on the facade of the state capitol of Minnesota . After fourteen months of uncertainty , there could be  | no doubt in their minds : America never forgot . Largely isolated in captivity , they clung to each other in freedom and gathered relatives in their trail , so that they moved in a permanent parade . Forty-one of the 52 volunteered for a decorous press conference at West Point , where they were mostly backdrops for former Charge d'Affaires L. Bruce Laingen 's touching struggle to put their gratitude into words . Half a million turned out in Washington to cheer them on their way to the White House for their meeting with President Reagan , who offered thanks " for making us proud to be Americans . " Twenty-two accepted New York City 's invitation to ride in a ticker-tape parade up Broadway , and ? along with multitudinous relatives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ragan ? checked into the Waldorf-Astoria for two days of the most elaborate and expensive entertainment the city had to offer . The @# @#  | hostages ' choice for their first night out : the bawdy burlesque of Mickey Rooney and Ann Miller in " Sugar Babies . " " We 've been fantasizing about this stuff for a long time , " one explained . Their New York holiday ran until checkout time Saturday , guaranteeing that for some the welcomes would stretch into their third week of freedom . Pageantry : The White House greeting on the South Lawn struck just the right note of sincerity played in the difficult key of high pageantry ? a ceremony that the hostages and their families found as mercifully brief as it was touching . It was also a showcase for Laingen , whose measured eloquence and boyish good looks caught the eye of Democrats in his native Minnesota who are looking for an attractive candidate for the Senate in 1982 ( they had no idea , however , whether Laingen is a Democrat or Republican ) . In the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission in which eight servicemen died . Reagan took advantage of the occasion to warn of " swift and effective retribution " if American diplomats are ever again attacked abroad ; Secretary of State Alexander Haig later explained that the exact nature of that retribution was being kept " consciously ambiguous . " In contrast with that finely tuned ceremony , the hometown greetings took place in a blare of high-school bands and a flush of local politicians . Screeching teen-agers in Rocky Sickmann T shirts greeted handsome Marine Sgt. Rodney ( Rocky ) Sickmann , 23 , at St. Louis 's Lambert Field . " I love you all ! " he shouted , as he made his way slowly through the throng , kissing babies and shaking hands . Army S/Sgt. 24 Joseph Subic spent the first ten minutes of his welcome trapped in his limousine by a throng of well-wishers and reporters . Marine Sgt. Kevin Hermening , at 21 the youngest of the former hostages , carried off his return to Milwaukee with impressive poise , briskly inspecting his Marine honor guard as he passed in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home free of charge , and once they arrived , more gifts awaited them . On behalf of the hostages , New York officials rejected an offer of jeans embroidered with the legend : " I 'm free for love . " But Sickmann accepted a replica of the St. Louis Gateway Arch , Hermening got a lifetime pass to the Brewers and Marine Sgt. Johnny McKeel Jr . got a cowboy hat ? several sizes too big . Champagne : They luxuriated in their freedom . New Yorker Barry Rosen ? a Jew whose wife , Barbara , is a Roman Catholic ? went straight from thanksgiving ser - ices at St. Patrick 's Cathedral to Temple Emanu-El , where he asked if he could hold the Torah for a few minutes . Joseph Hall and his wife toasted freedom with Dom Perignon champagne at New York 's luxury restaurant Windows on the World , looking down from the 107th floor at the Statue of Liberty . Their meal of stuffed veal roast and " red , white and blueberry strudel " tasted no sweeter than the first Big Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel . Asked if it would be difficult to adjust to freedom , Cooke smiled and answered : " It was hard getting adjusted to captivity . It 's going to be very , very easy getting used to freedom . " The hard part was getting used to shoes , which had been taken away from most of them early in their captivity , apparently to discourage escapes . The marines who joked about getting back to chasing women would have to do it on sore and blistered feet . A generation of germs that had grown @#  | up in America while they were gone found them easy prey ; most came down with colds , and at least two ? Col. Leland Holland and Robert C. Ode , at 65 the oldest hostage ? were hospitalized with bronchitis . The adoration of an entire nation was more than some hostages wanted to face . " I know it 's impossible , but I 'd like to get back to leading a normal life , " sighed Marine Sgt. James Lopez , back home in Globe , Ariz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " An Iranian-American waiter thought he would make Cooke feel at home by asking in Persian for his autograph . Jerry Plotkin , the Los Angeles businessman , had to run a gantlet of shouting reporters who wanted his answer to allegations of drug dealing . Plotkin said he had gone to Iran to start a personnel firm . Almost everywhere they went , politicians clamored to share their glory . The order of march for New York 's parade carefully rationed the hostages among local officeholders , most of whom are up for reelection this year . Joseph Subic 's official welcome in Detroit included the introduction of such luminaries as the Wayne County commissioner of roads . The hostages were free to skip it all , of course , but most gamely smiled as the bands launched into their umpteenth chorus of " Tie a Yellow Ribbon " ? recognizing , as Moorhead Kennedy 's wife , Louisa , put it : " We owe the public as much of us for a while as they want to see . " Outrage : There was some doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( page 27 ) , but it was clear that the rest of the country found it therapeutic . Awash in love , Americans found it difficult to keep the fires of vengeance lit . The outrage that greeted the first reports of torture began to subside as the story of the 444 days emerged in fuller detail : long stretches of painful boredom , interrupted by seemingly random bullying by their young captors ( page 28 ) . One former hostage , political officer Elizabeth Ann Swift , took pains to correct a report in last week 's NEWSWEEK that an Iranian guard had put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger on an empty chamber . * Physicians were quick to deny a careless report by White House press secretary James Brady that " about a dozen " of the former hostages were suffering severe psychiatric problems . The actual number is " three or four , " according to Dr. Jerome Korcak , who treated the freed captives in Germany ? and the ailments are all " treatable and transient . " The cries of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week came from a rally of Iranian exiles ? while inside , President Reagan @# Yellow ribbons and dress blues : Sam Gillette goes home to Columbia , Pa. ; the citizens of Pueblo , Colo. , greet Marine Cpl . William Gallegos Fred S. Prouser j , . 1981 NEWSWEEK/FEBRUARY 9 , 1981  | told a news conference : " I do n't think revenge is worthy of us . " Some of the former hostages , however , did n't think forgiveness was in order . Robert O. Blucker , the embassy 's economics officer , had found solace in hating his captors , and he was unwilling to stop ; he recommended " forceful , military " revenge . But communications and records officer William Belk of West Columbia , S.C. , said he " did n't want hate to end this . " In freedom , a range of complex and sometimes contradictory emotions came to the surface . Some were angry at the visiting American clergymen who painted a rosy picture of their conditions .

' Eating Ourselves Alive ' : Resentment over the incident that landed them in captivity -- the decision to admit the Shah to the United States for medical treatment -- ran like a red thread through the bland text of the hostages ' statements on American policy . " We were eating ourselves alive , " Barry Rosen recalls . " Why ? If anybody in Washington says they were n't warned , they 're lying through their teeth . " For fourteen months the hostages brooded that their warnings had gone unheeded , and it fed their worst fear : that they had been forgotten , ignored , shunted aside as an embarassment . There was no way for them to know how wrong they were . A whole nation sensed their need , and it reached out to them in love . " Never , " Laingen concluded , " has so small a group owed so much to so many . " @# @# @#
