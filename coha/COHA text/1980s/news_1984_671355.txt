Senator Hawkins , who is 57 years old , said after the morning session in the Sheraton National Hotel here that except for her mother , " I have never told anyone till now , not even my husband. " // Her comments came during a hearing by the Senate Chidren ' s Caucus , the first program on the agenda of the Third National Conference on Sexual Victimization of Children . It is being conducted by the division of child protection of the Children ' s Hospital National Medical Center in Washington. // // <> <> Senator Hawkins ' s Statement // " When I was 5 years old , " said Senator Hawkins , a Republican of Florida , " I was abused by a neighbor , a man around the corner , who baby-sat for all the kids and always gave us toys and candy . I told my mother . Fortunately she believed me , and she interviewed all the other mothers on the block . We went to court , and I was one of the witnesses . But the man was let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying . " Senator Hawkins told reporters later that she now asks her 6-year-old granddaughter , " Does anything spooky ever happen to you ? " She said of her molestation : " All that happened to me was that the man hugged me and then put his hands in my pants . But my mother had been specific with me , and I knew something had happened that I didn ' t understand . Luckily , my mother acted right away , and we were fortunate to be able to move away the next month because my father was in the Navy. " // " Still , " she continued , " it took me a long time to get over it . And the horror of the trial remains with me . Whenever I am in court , I am reminded of how tiny I felt at age 4 1/2 , how huge everyone else looked . And that man - he just moved back into the neighborhood , where he remained for the rest of his life. " ) // Although conference planners had expected only 800 psychiatrists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sexually abused children , more than 1 , 300 had registered by this morning . The unusually big turnout was attributed by many to the the furor generated by recent reports of child abuse that persisted for long periods of time . These included incidents in a nursery school in Manhattan Beach , Calif. , and at a children ' s theater school in Minneapolis. // Senator Christopher J. Dodd , Democrat of Connecticut , co-chairman of the Senate Children ' s Caucus , said : " By even the most conservative estimates , a child is sexually abused someplace in this country every two minutes . One in every five victims is a child under the age of 7 , and close to half of all victims under age 18 will be the targets of repeated sexual abuse . Young boys are not exempt from such victimization . Neither are infants , given reported cases of sexual abuse involving children only months old. " // Senator Dodd said he would introduce legislation next week to use Federal challenge grants to encourage states to finance programs to prevent and treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a provision in the Labor Committee to restore Federal financing for such programs ; the financing was cut by half in 1981. // <> <> Bribery and Threats Reported // Senator Hawkins ' s revelation mirrored the themes that were taken up over and over by speakers and participants later in the conference. // They told of the use of bribery and intimidation by adults to lure very young children into sexual relations and then silence them with a variety of threats . And they cited the tendency of courts in the past not to take the word of young children or to be concerned about how legal procedures , such as cross-examination , can affect them . In New York , Governor Cuomo signed a bill last week to drop the requirement for corroboration of a child ' s testimony of sexual abuse. // Statistics on child abuse are hard to come by , the experts said , because states do not have a uniform system of recording violations against children and in many cases , records of such violations are lumped together with those on adults. // A panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned by Senators Dodd and Hawkins , along with Senator Arlen Specter , Republican of Pennsylvania , and Senator John H. Chafee , Republican of Rhode Island . They were asked what programs might be most effective in helping children become aware of the threat of abuse. // Kee MacFarlane , director of the Child Sexual Abuse Diagnostic and Treatment Center of the Children ' s Institute International , a United Way agency , is interviewing the children who attended the McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach. // Today , looking at the children ' s panel , whose members ranged in age from 7 to 16 , she commented : " These children are old . We are used to seeing children under 5 . " She was referring not only to the Manhattan Beach children but to many others with whom she has worked . <> <> Abuse of a 15-Month-Old Child // " We see sexual abuse of children whose diapers must be removed for abuse to occur , " Miss MacFarlane said . " A 15-month-old was recently found to have sperm in her urine. " // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , " she continued . " We ' ve seen hundreds of children who ' ve said ' no , ' who ' ve begged ' no , ' and it doesn ' t help . And we have seen children who have been so sexualized that we must wean them away from sex - they go through withdrawal when they lose that stimulation . We also see children who become offenders themselves , among them three 7-year- olds. " // Until the Reagan Administration abolished her position , Miss MacFarlane was a child sex-abuse specialist for six years with the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect , a Federal agency. // Although her observations were not confined to the Manhattan Beach case , Miss MacFarlane said after the session that she and her colleagues had already interviewed 200 children who attended the Manhattan Beach school and had 200 more on a waiting list . They range in age from 2 1/2 to 19 . <> <> Parents Not to Blame // She emphasized that parents in such cases were not to blame . " People do not deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing else , " she said . " There was a waiting list of a year for the school in Manhattan Beach . This kind of situation will only increase with the desperation for child care. " // Sometimes the spotlight at the conference shifted away from children to adult offenders , the courts and the rehabilitation system. // The difficulty faced by judges who must decide the fate of child molesters was described by Associate Judge Reggie B. Walton of Superior Court in the District of Columbia. // " Last summer , " the judge said , " I tried a man who had molested his minor sister-in-law , his 9-year-old stepdaughter and his 6-year-old son . He had also previously been in a mental institution for molesting his terminally ill mother on her deathbed , and the family dog . " <> <> Sentenced to 26 Years // " He was convicted , " Judge Walton said , " and I had to decide what to do with him , to see if any programs could help him . I gave him the minimum sentence of 26 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so he will probably be paroled at age 52 . There are no programs in our institutions here to help him. " // Dr. A. Nicholas Groth , director of the sex-offender program at the Connecticut Correctional Institution in Somers , said that the typical offender was " most likely a victim himself , and because his problems were not addressed , he moved into the role of victimizer. " // " More than 80 percent of the men we treat were abused as children , so we need prevention , " Dr. Groth said . " We must deal with the perpetrator with more than anger and punishment. " //
