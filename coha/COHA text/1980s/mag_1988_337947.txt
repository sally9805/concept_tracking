The job of Attorney General in Colombia is about as secure as that of a high- wire acrobat . In January , Attorney General Carlos Mauro Hoyos Jimenez was kidnaped and brutally murdered by henchmen of the Medellin cocaine cartel for advocating the reinstitution of a Colombian-U.S. extradition law . Now his replacement , Acting Attorney General Alfredo Gutierrez Marquez , 63 , has resigned . The reason : cocaine traffickers had used an airstrip on a ranch owned by his brother Libardo , 70 . Gutierrez may have lacked the right attitude for his job anyway . Three weeks after assuming his post , he suggested that the best way to defeat the drug lords was to legalize cocaine .
