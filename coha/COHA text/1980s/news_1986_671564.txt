Inflation causes havoc in the bond markets as investors demand higher interest rates to protect the value of their securities . When interest rates rise , bond prices fall .

But now , after four years of inflation at 4 percent or less , and with important drops in oil prices pointing to a rate of 3 percent or less this year , investors are buying bonds with yields that would have been unthinkable just months ago . <> <> ' A Great Deal of Pain ' // " It ' s a delicious moment in history , " said Robert J. Barbera , chief economist at the E.F. Hutton &; Company brokerage house . " The country went through a great deal of pain to reduce inflation , with no economic growth from 1978 through 1982. " // " I don ' t recall anything like this , " said James A. Stern , a managing director at the Shearson Lehman Brothers securities firm . " Guys who would not touch 11 percent bonds now can ' t get enough of them at 8 1/2 percent , " he said , because they feared that rates would fall further. // With bond yields now at their lowest levels since 1978 , corporations needing financing have already issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Stern said that " we still have a backlog of financings a mile long.

" The budget deficit is helped because lower oil prices stimulate economic activity and increase Federal tax revenues . At the same time , lower oil prices help reduce the trade deficit by cutting oil-import costs. // One of the most surprising aspects of the sharp drop in long-term interest rates is that it has not been accompanied by any significant change in Federal Reserve monetary policy or a drop in short-term interest rates . Predictions by economists of an easier Federal Reserve policy have been consistently wrong the last eight months , and short-term rates have been essentially unchanged since the middle of last year. // Because the Federal Reserve has not eased policy , many economists doubt that the banking system is likely to soon reduce the prime lending rate used as a benchmark for short-term loans to businesses . <> <> Prime Rate Cut Doubted // " It is unlikely you will see a prime rate cut until we see short-term rates down , and that is not going to happen until the Fed changes policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic advisory firm of Griggs &; Santow. // According to some analysts , the ability of long-term interest rates to fall sharply without a move by the Federal Reserve to an easier monetary policy may encourage the central bank to hold policy stable. // The Federal Reserve reported yesterday that the nation ' s money supply declined by $600 million in the week ended Feb. 17. // Participants in the financial markets said the money supply results were in line with expectations. // Maria S. Ramirez , economist for Drexel Burnham &; Company , predicted that the money supply numbers would continue to encourage lower interest rates . Despite the weekly decline , money remains abundant , she said. // The $600 million decline reported yesterday , to $630. 6 billion , was well within the Federal Reserve ' s targets for its M-1 measure of the money supply . M-1 consists of currency in the hands of the public and checking accounts and check-like deposits at banks and savings institutions . The upper limit of the Federal Reserve ' s target was $632. 5 billion , and the lower limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Reserve , which rose to $682 million , from $606 million the previous week , was the only negative note in the central bank ' s report cited by economists . A rise in borrowings could indicate that banks could not get enough reserves from the market and were forced to borrow from the Federal Reserve . That , in turn , could mean a tighter monetary policy by the central bank. // But economsts said that the rise was the result of large borrowings by only a few huge banks and that it did not indicate that banks in general were short of reserves. //
