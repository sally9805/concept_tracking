So when Richard E. T. White , the director-in-residence at the Berkeley Repertory Theater , in Berkeley , Calif. , went to see a theater piece based on Dickens ' s novel " Hard Times , " staged in a small room above a London pub by four actors using no costumes and no scenery except two chairs , he didn ' t expect much. // " I thought it was going to be a waste of time , " says Mr. White . " Instead , here were these four extraordinary actors who created this incredibly compelling theater production , playing a total of 22 characters . I was really thrilled by it. " // Indeed , Mr. White was so taken with " Hard Times " that he ended up bringing it to Berkeley , where he directed a production with company actors last fall . Now " Hard Times " is coming to New York as part of the 1987 American Theater Exchange , the Joyce Theater Foundation ' s second regional theater festival . Under the direction of Mr. White , performances start tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where " Hard Times " will mark Berkeley Rep ' s New York debut. // The Berkeley company has expanded the original London pub concept only marginally , using five actors instead of four . In this production , which runs slightly over three hours , one person plays one character and performs the musical accompaniment while the other four actors create nearly two dozen additional characters. // " Hard Times " was originally designed for such a limited cast out of practical necessity . The adaptation of Dickens ' s novel was written by Stephen Jeffreys , an English playwright , for a small repertory company in England ' s Lake District that only had four actors. // " The reason I did ' Hard Times ' was because it was Dickens , and Dickens is good box office , and this was about the only Dickens novel you could seriously do with four people , " Mr. Jeffreys explains . " ' Hard Times ' is the most direct of Dickens ' s novels , because he wrote it for weekly serialization rather than monthly , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprawling than some of his other books - which made it very good for the stage . The thrill is in seeing a very small company do something that is very big , creating not only 22 characters but a wide social scope . Crowd scenes are very hard to pull off with four people , but I think with that scale , the audience knows right off that it ' s an entirely different ball game . They ' re amazed that four actors can keep on coming up with new characters and very quick changes . That ' s where the thrill comes in for the audience ; you have to use your imagination an awful lot , and a good company will convey that kind of raw theatrical excitement. " // Of course , the Royal Shakespeare Company is a hard act to follow under any circumstances . " It ' s inevitable that this is going to be compared to ' Nicholas Nickleby , ' " Mr. White acknowledges . " ' Nicholas Nickleby ' was an incredibly sumptuous theatrical experience . The production was very large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the book itself . It was symphonic , whereas ' Hard Times ' is a chamber piece . It ' s a different experience - but it ' s no less moving . ' Hard Times ' throws much more emphasis on acting and characterization . You don ' t have huge sets or a bunch of elaborate costume changes ; the emphasis is really on acting and language to carry the story forward. " // The story itself is one that generates a remarkable resonance for contemporary audiences , both in England and in the United States . When Mr. White saw " Hard Times " in London , England was gripped by a coal miners ' strike that provided a remarkable parallel to the story ' s focus on a mill worker ' s strike . " The tension in the room during the strike scene was palpable , " he says . " The energy and the sense of everyone ' s feelings being put completely on the line by a man who wrote 100 years before really thrilled me. " // Mr. White , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago , anticipates that American audiences will be particularly sensitive to the philosophical conflict at the heart of " Hard Times . " " The story is a takeoff on the philosophy of Utilitarianism that resonates very strongly against the kind of 1980 ' s Neo-Conservatism we ' re seeing here , " he explains . " The central character is a man named Thomas Gradgrind whose philosophy is that everything can be weighed and measured . He is sort of the apotheosis of self-interest ; everything can be reduced to facts , everything is knowable and quantifiable , and therefore everything can be put to use in your own self-interest . During the course of the play , he sees how this philosophy destroys the lives of his children . The other spokesman is Bounderby , who is a ruthless pragmatist , a self-made businessman who is a practitioner of situational ethics . He ' s a wonderful metaphor for all these incredible scandals that are going on in the business world right now . The whole piece has a kind of satirical view that I think resonates very deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re dealing with. " // Sharon Ott , the artistic director of Berkeley Rep , sees the company ' s relatively spare production as enhancing that message . " As a novel , ' Hard Times ' is more directly political than ' Nicholas Nickleby , ' and Stephen Jeffreys ' adaptation is very directly political , " she says . " Part of the idea of a few people doing it is that it makes it less of a pageant and really concentrates on the message of the piece , which is a sterner , harsher vision than that of ' Nicholas Nickleby . ' ' Hard Times ' has the same lovely , lively Dickensian characters , but it ' s about tough times - and it doesn ' t have a happy ending . All of that , we thought , militated against over-production and anything that would resemble the kind of spectacle ' Nicholas Nickleby ' was . ' Nicholas Nickleby ' was great theater , but we really believe in this piece . What it says socially and politically is the real reason to do it - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
