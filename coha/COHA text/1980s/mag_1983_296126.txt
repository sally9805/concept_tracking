ELENI by Nicholas Gage ; Random House ; 470 pages ; $15.95 <P> As the Communist attempt to take over Greece became an increasingly bloody failure in 1948 , the desperate leftist guerrillas , driven back to a few mountain coverts , adopted a cruel strategy : a pedomasoma , a " gathering up of children . " The young were taken from occupied villages and sent as hostages to Albania and other nearby Iron Curtain countries . Publicly the guerrillas said the children were being protected from the hazards of war . In fact , the plan was meant to terrorize their parents into subservience to the guerrillas and to indoctrinate the children as a new generation of revolutionaries . <P> Peasants of the steep Mourgana region , the northwest roof of Greece , were horrified by the pedomasoma , but they were battered and half-starved by a decade of war , and few had the strength or cunning to resist . One who did was Eleni Gatzoyiannis of the little farm hamlet Lia . Though she had spent her life deferring to her father , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a diner in far-off America who returned periodically to visit , Eleni was transformed by crisis into a leader : she organized the escape of 20 people of Lia , most of them women and children , down the mountains and through the line of battle . The group made it . Eleni did not . On the eve of the flight , she was ordered to harvest wheat under guerrilla supervision in fields miles away . When the escape was discovered , she was tortured , " tried " for treason , and denounced by neighbors who had envied her few pitiful " riches " from America . Then she was shot . Her last words were the cry " My children ! " <P> One of those children was eight-year-old Nikola . Transported to the U.S. to join a father he had never met , the boy discovered the cathartic power of words when he wrote a school essay about his mother 's death . He took the name Nicholas Gage and grew up to become an investigative reporter and foreign correspondent for the New York Times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsession . In 1979 Gage quit the newspaper to learn how and why his mother had been killed . He planned a crime of vengeance . He failed at that , but he has achieved instead , in Eleni , a kind of resurrection . <P> His book , part thriller , part history , part romantic epic , is a remarkable feat of technique , and of soul . Gage deftly shifts among hundreds of characters , dozens of locales , and a welter of big-scale narratives-World War II , the Greek civil war , the exodus of Mourgana refugees in every direction-that in lesser hands would overwhelm the story of one woman 's family . He manages to be fair to people he has every reason to despise : he evokes the grievances of the guerrillas as fully as their treachery , the gullibility of the villagers as well as their jealousy and spite . Painfully , he recalls the mother whom he revered with the absolute awe and devotion of a child . Yet as he tells the story of her utter heroism , he views her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
