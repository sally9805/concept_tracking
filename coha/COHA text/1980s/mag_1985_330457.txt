Glowing with confidence after President Reagan 's landslide re-election , the Republican Party last spring launched an ambitious drive to persuade Democratic voters to switch their party affiliation . Dubbing their plan Operation Open Door , Republican National Committee leaders hoped to win 100,000 converts in 100 days in four target states : Florida , Louisiana , North Carolina and Pennsylvania . Last week R.N.C . Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf declared the operation " a remarkable success " that indicated a growing political realignment in the U.S. More remarkable was the way the R.N.C . compiled its totals . In Florida , the Republicans claimed to have won 28,064 defectors , a respectable number , if considerably short of the 45,000 goal for that state . Yet only 9,203 new registration cards had been processed . The party also counted some 2,500 unprocessed cards and added 15,986 " changes in progress "  --  voters who had promised to register as Republicans . The R.N.C . used similar arithmetic in the three other target states , and threw in reregistrations in California to hit the 100,000 mark . In all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registrations in the four states . " Operation Open Door ? " scoffed Democratic National Committee Spokesman Terry Michael . " They should rename it Operation Open Mouth , because somebody sure put his foot in it . "
