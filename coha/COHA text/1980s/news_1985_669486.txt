A cluster of tiny , square , windowless houses made of cow dung snakes along the eastern bank of the Sabarmati River in the northwestern state of Gujarat . A small crowd of women and children has gathered at the village well , armed with shiny brass and aluminum water pots . Their voices float lightly on the still , sunny air . The only other sound is a rooster ' s insistent crowing. // // The women , in saris of pink , purple , and red , reweave their gleaming black hair into single braids to hang down their backs . A small , barefoot girl gingerly makes her way down a rutted dirt path to her house , carrying a large brass ewer of water on her head . Not a drop is spilled. // The river has shrunk to a sliver of its normal size . Its bed , green and flat and wide , is the village latrine . A lone woman , graceful in a white sari , wanders away from her house toward the river , seemingly to no purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small . It is so early , she trusts that no men will see her . These will be her last moments of privacy until nightfall. // Every day , in villages around the world , women wake to mornings like this one . <> <> Water and fuel - the search for essentials // Those with a well near their homes are the most fortunate , but even for them the water is often tainted by human or animal waste . Others must walk miles - sometimes for many hours each day - to a source of water , which , again , is not always pure . If the water source is very far away , the women walk to it in the evening , spend the night , and return to their villages at dawn , carrying heavy pots of water on their heads. // Roosters are crowing , too , in Hacienda de Oculixtlahuacan , high in the mountains of Guerrero in southwestern Mexico . A bumpy dirt road runs along the spine of the mountain , past sagging , whitewashed houses with thick , palm-thatched roofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is therefore surprising , in midafternoon , to meet three little girls about eight years old laboriously climbing out of a deep ravine and onto the village road. // The girls are barefoot , and their thin , ragged dresses hang loosely about them . Each is carrying a huge bundle of sticks and branches on her shoulder - a bundle so round and high that her upstretched hand can not reach the top to hold it in place . The wood is packed so tightly , though , and the girls are so protective of their loads , that not a twig is lost. // The jagged mountains of Guerrero are lush and green , but in most of the developing world , firewood for cooking has become chronically scarce . Although various types of fuel-efficient stoves are being promoted in many countries , especially in Africa , most women still forage for sticks and twigs on land where the last tree was felled long ago. // Where the scarcity of firewood may be forcing families to eat more uncooked meals , nutrition suffers .

They are splitting palm leaves into even lengths , ready to be woven into baskets - a task that leaves their fingers cracked and swollen . A three-year-old brother plays in the dirt nearby . It is 4 o ' clock in the afternoon. // Angelina ' s mother left the house at 8 this morning and has spent the intervening hours bent over her husband ' s quarter-acre plot of land in the broiling sun , her head at knee level and her week-old daughter strapped to her back . The land allotted to feed her family is insufficient , because the remaining three acres have been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the market each day , but the income from the sugar cane is not enough. // Although most African women are responsible for raising the food to feed their families , it is the men who usually make the decisions regarding land use , and they often prefer to turn their plots to cash crops . Few women can produce sufficient food on the land that remains . They must buy what they can on the local market , and family nutrition suffers. // ' ' I need money , ' ' has become the universal lament of women around the world . This growing need for cash has prompted many rural men to look for work outside their villages . It has been observed that roads constructed in remote areas in recent years have served mainly to take the men away , leaving the women behind with many children to care for and few resources . And often , the money men earn away from their homes does not find its way back to their families . In parts of sub-Saharan Africa , in particular , support of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Time and again , observers have said that a man who earns cash in the cities is often just as likely to spend it on beer , a transistor radio , a new shirt , or another woman , as he is to bring or send it home to his wife. // Almost the only source of income Angelina ' s mother has is to sell baskets in the local market . Many rural women walk several hours a day to market with their produce on their heads . Women interviewed , from Bolivia to Senegal to Nepal , said they eke out only the barest means of survival in this way . All complained of inflation : What they need to buy invariably costs more than they can earn . <> <> The lure of the city // Because of the increasing hardships of village life around the world , migration to the cities is steadily swelling. // Most families imagine that the city offers better opportunities for work , an improved standard of living , and greater prospects for their children than the village - stagnant and isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the old ways , most do not realize that in their village there is a spirit of community , of security and stability , which could hardly withstand the brutalities of life in an urban slum. // ' ' Where would you like to live when you grow up ?

She turned her head away shyly , her finger tracing a circle in the dust. // ' ' I want to stay here , ' ' she said. // But whether her village will be able to support her in the future is by no means certain. // // //
