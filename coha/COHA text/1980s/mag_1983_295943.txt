A disputed passage of arms <P> Ronald Reagan 's arms control negotiators face an immensely difficult task in trying to push their Soviet counterparts toward an agreement . But a secret memo seen last week by a few Senators suggests that Ambassador Edward Rowny , chief negotiator at the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks in Geneva , may spend nearly as much time suspiciously eyeing his own colleagues as he does watching his adversaries across the table . <P> The five-page memo contains Rowny 's assessment of some 18 members of the START delegation and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency . Rowny gave it to Kenneth Adelman , President Reagan 's controversial choice to be the new director of the agency . The document is just short of a " hit list , " expressing sharp criticism and mistrust of almost everyone it mentions . <P> It contends , for example , that James Goodby , a highly respected career Foreign Service officer and former Ambassador to Finland , who is Rowny 's deputy in Geneva , and Jack Mendelsohn , the former ACDA representative on the delegation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It complains that Thomas Graham , a veteran ACDA lawyer who helped draft the U.S. proposals now under discussion , is suspect because he has been spending time with aides to Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker . Why that troubles Rowny is puzzling ; Graham is in charge of the agency 's congressional relations . The memo also suggests that certain members of Congress , including Colorado 's Democratic Senator Gary Hart , be kept away from the arms talks in Geneva . Hart , who has frequently visited the negotiations , angrily called for Rowny 's dismissal last week : " He 's trying to subvert the arms control process , " and " has outlived his usefulness . " <P> Rowny , not very plausibly , deflected the blame for the memo to an aide , Samuel Watson , who had drafted it , and contended that it does not reflect his thinking . Under questioning at his Senate confirmation hearings last Feb. 3 , Adelman said he had never heard " anyone " in the Administration suggest any kind of housecleaning or purge of the agency . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rowny face to face in January and that Rowny later telephoned Adelman with more comments about personnel . Adelman jotted some notes on the memo , and then sent a copy to his friend J. Robinson West , Assistant Secretary of the Interior , seeking advice on how to manage the arms control agency . Adelman also attached a memo of his own that , says one Senator who has seen it , " has a lot of reflection on what they ought to be doing about personnel . " <P> For its part , the White House was glum and annoyed about these developments , but stood by Adelman . Continuing to stand fast may require cleats : last week the Senate Foreign Relations Committee issued a report contending that Adelman lacks the " stature , experience , knowledge and commitment " for the job .
