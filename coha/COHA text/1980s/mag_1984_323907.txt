Flamboyant Charles Wick admits to making secret tapes <P> He travels surrounded by four bodyguards , stays in $200-a-night hotel suites and hands out $5 tips . His hosts are often given precise instructions to provide him with a telephone at all times , a bed for a nap in the afternoon , even a piano to play by night . Security guards at his Washington headquarters are supplied with his picture and told never to ask for his identification . The United States Information Agency ( then called the International Communication Agency ) was a neglected foreign policy backwater before Charles Z. Wick , 66 , became its director in 1981 , but the former Hollywood moviemaker , venture capitalist and , most important , close friend of Ronald Reagan 's has brought to the agency righteous zeal and a show-biz tone . He has also earned an uncomplimentary reputation for a bumptious manner and an attention-getting lifestyle . <P> Last week Wick was back in the headlines , this time for covertly making tapes of his phone conversations . He at first denied that he secretly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with the leaked transcripts of conversations with half a dozen notables , including Senator Mark Hatfield , Actor Kirk Douglas and former Ambassador to Great Britain Walter Annenberg , Wick admitted that he had " in haste " failed to inform a " small percentage " of his callers that they were being tape-recorded . He apologized , saying , " I can understand how some might feel that it was intrusive . " Wick , who in 1981 had been advised by the USIA general counsel not to secretly record his calls , says he disconnected his machine last July . <P> The furor over the disclosure is indicative of the growing sensitivity to the secret taping of phone calls both inside and outside government . The practice is " an offense against good reporting , against good business and particularly against good government , " declares Times Columnist William Safire , who broke the story and who is still smarting from a wiretap of his own calls ordered by the Nixon Administration in 1969 . Any surreptitious use of tape recorders is " flat wrong , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Bugging is bugging , no matter what you call it . " Many major press organizations , including the Washington Post , the Los Angeles Times and CBS , bar reporters from secretly taping calls . New York Times Executive Editor A.M. Rosenthal reminded his staff of their paper 's own strict rules the day the Times printed the Wick story . The practice is illegal in at least a dozen states , and the American Bar Association Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility considers it unethical for lawyers to tape conversations surreptitiously . " It 's not done at the White House , " said Spokesman Larry Speakes . " Not since 1974 . " Before the Watergate scandal , however , telephone conversations were routinely transcribed at many Government agencies . And despite the policies of their employers , many journalists continue to tape calls , claiming the interests of accuracy . <P> Wick used the same justification . Few suggested that he had malicious motives .                    @
